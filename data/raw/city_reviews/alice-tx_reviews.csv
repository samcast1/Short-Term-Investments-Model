Stayed with kids","This Airbnb was superb! There was room and space for my family and I to stay for a family reunion! The parking was perfect for our cars. We walked to the restaurant for breakfast and dinner (Jalisciense). The rooms, the two living rooms, the two bathrooms, everything we needed was there as if it were our home. The back yard with patio was perfect to sit and visit. Franklin has an amazing place. Our stay was very comfortable!
Thank you again, Franklin."

Stayed with kids","Franklin's house in Alice is so much more than the pictures can show you. Very spacious, and that would be an understatement. There is more than enough room for everyone. Room for sleeping, room to spend time together and room to spend time apart. We also loved the hometown feel of Alice. The house is so centrally located it's unbelievable. So many great places to eat. There are gas stations, retail stores and groceries within just miles of the house. Corpus Christi and the BEACHES are only an hour away. We absolutely loved our stay. The house made it so much easier to just enjoy ourselves. TY so much Franklin. We would definitely book again any day."

There is a Walmart super close and several places to eat nearby as well. The house was very clean and easy to navigate.

Recommended Franklin to dust the facility closer to the date of when a guest would be checking in, otherwise great stay! Walmart/Gas Station 1 mile away for small grocery runs. Overall, enjoyed the stay and would recommend to others."

Terry is an amazing host! He was very helpful for questions about amenities and responded within minutes to questions. His communication was engaging from the moment that I booked all the way through my departure. He reached out periodically to make sure that I was doing well and asked if I needed anything. Nice touch, Terry!
I brought my mother with me on the trip. She is 78 and really appreciated the easy access to the house, the rooms, and especially enjoyed reading on the patio. The preset nightlights made navigating the house simple and safe while we learned the layout.
I love to cook and enjoy my morning coffee. The kitchen is amazing and well fortified. The coffee bar is so inviting. Thank you, Terry, for a fantastic experience!"

This is a lakehouse so the idea is to spend as much time outside and it is the perfect location for that. We really enjoyed the game room that had pool and shuffleboard. I was expecting two bathrooms in the house but there was only one and the other is in the separate game room. It could have possibly stated that and I just didn't read it well enough but that hiccup won't stop us from renting again. The home is supplied with everything you could possibly need in the kitchen.

Stayed a few nights","The house was fine, just not in the best shape. The game room didn’t have the items pictured, and the equipment was broken. The pool table had a broken stick, no chalk, and the rack was broken. No air hockey or foosball table. The shuffleboard table, broken equipment. So not as pictured. Had a nice time…but wouldn’t rebook. A broken down boat and lots of rubbish around the house. Janice was lovely though!"

Having the game room kept the family entertained, the kitchen was equipped with everything I needed to cook for my family and the view of the lake was beautiful. I would definitely recommend this place for others and wouldn’t mind staying during the more warmer months."

The fridge in the game room had mold when we arrived. Terrible smell in the laundry room/seating netted area. Place needs updates and to be cleaned better. But Janice was good at communicating, and gave me almost a full refund for the issues."

Stayed over a week","We rented Janice’s lovely little lake house for over a month and did not want to leave! If you are looking for something out of town, peaceful, and clean with excellent views and good amenities, this is the place. The house is quaint, but it has a detached game room, patio with fire pit, dock, and substantial shoreline with a lot of privacy close to a quiet cove. Bonus- the neighbors on this street are exceptional human beings in case, for instance, your truck breaks down and you need groceries (yes, this really happened and more and we received a lot of kindness and generosity from folks in this neighborhood). Janice was above and beyond as a host. Cannot recommend her place enough!"

The lake was beautiful and calm, the game room keep us busy for hours, the fire pit was a great way to relax each night, and the house had the perfect amount of space for us to all sleep and hang out. We will definitely keep this place on our list to come back to."

We enjoyed the games they have available and played many games of dominoes 😊 Janice is great to work with and had no issues checking in or out. Only down side was all the spiders on the steps and in the game room. Since it is on a lake you can expect this but nothing to really clean them off with. The shuffleboard game is awesome along with the pool table 😎 Very relaxing and would stay here again."

We caught so many fish! The place is very clean and had everything you could possibly want. I do wish the game room would be updated and new towels for the price. I do think this place would be better for kids 5 and up. Our 1 year old loved being outside, but we would have had difficulty with not having a fence separating the water from that big step down if he was walking independently. I loved this place and would love to go back when my little one is a bit older."

From waking up to a beautiful sun filled lake view in the morning to star gazing on the wooden swing, it was just the relaxing trip we needed to decompress. We enjoyed the pier as we fished and the kids swam, ending with smores around the firepit. The separate game room was amazing in not only the set up and games, but when someone wanted to rest they wouldn't be kept up with the noise of those staying up later. Highly recommend this place for the perfect lakeside getaway. We will definitely be returning again!"

We did some fishing, played in the yard, hung out in the game room, hung out on the pier, watched the sunrise, watch the moon come up over the lake while we had a campfire in the nice oversized fire ring. So much more to add but to summarize, it was relaxing and it felt like home. The pictures just don’t tell the whole story and thankfully, we have stories of our own that we now carry from our stay."

Stayed a few nights","This lake house is a great place if you like to spend time on the lake. I wish I had brought my fishing rod because the pier was all ready with lights and benches for good fishing time. It has charming decorations all over the place.
All the chairs, games, and swingset are looking a little worse for wear though. I think the entire space is due for a good deep clean to pick up all the dead bugs and remove all the cobwebs inside and out. Thankfully the actual bedrooms and bathroom were clean and as described.
One thing to note on directions, when navigating to the house be sure to type the address in right. Our maps app navigated to 249 instead of the actual 251 address for some reason. If you arrive at night, the area is very very dark.
Overall, the lake house will be a very nice place to stay after a good deep cleaning for the upcoming season."

Stayed with kids","The lake house is pretty amazing and you definitely get what you paid for. The pier was perfect for fishing. We fished all day & night (so glad they had pier lights). The water is nice for fishing and swimming but be sure to wear water shoes due to the rocks. We definitely had fun with the game room which had an awesome pool table, shuffle board and many other gaming options even a GameCube! For the house, it had a cute homey touch with all the amenities you could think of. We definitely loved the sunroom that looked out towards the water. We opened the windows to let the cool breeze in and enjoyed our view. If you’re looking for a family friendly home, this is the house to choose. The kids can play in the water, at the game room, and there’s even a playground with swings! So much to do. Thanks again Janice! We loved our stay."

Stayed about a week","Great place to get away from it all. The view was amazing and the house was comfy and had enough room for all 7 of us. The game room was enjoyed by all. It was a week of 100+ degrees and the house A/C worked well, only wish the separate game room/boathouse had A/C too, but we managed with the fans and the nice breeze off the water. There's lots of bugs at night, so arrive before dark and have bug spray and candles. The house had everything that you could need and it was well kept. If you want to swim or rent a paddle board or kayak go to Corpus Christi State Park near Mathis. There's a HEB in Mathis, they also have firewood near the frozen foods. If you need some milk and bread nearby there's a new Dollar General off FM 534 South just 4 miles south of Carmel Drive. Alice is a bigger city with more shopping and restaurant options. They have a Walmart and Walgreens and CVS. I'd recommend Rockport Beach or Mustang Island for beach trips too. There was a lot of seaweed at Rockport Beach, but the kids didn't mind and had fun."

The game room and fire pit area was our groups main focus, there's a whole lot of activities that we didn't have much time for like the horseshoe pit, and board games. There is a TV but we never turned it on because there was so much fun to be had!

Plenty to do for all ages; such as a swing set and slide for my daughter, great fire pit for s'mores that my son loved, a separate game room with plenty of activities for any adult to enjoy. I am so happy that I chose this beautiful lake front home to spend my birthday with my family.
The kitchen was fully stocked for any cooking needs, the only thing I recommend is to bring your own portable girl.
What more can I say but that it was a definite 10/10 on the rate scale. I had so much fun that I will definitely be back this summer."

The location on the lake with the wildlife and starry nights is peaceful. Everything is well taken care of and Farrah has gone the extra mile to make her guests feel comfortable. After a long day of driving, what do you want? A comfortable bed. Many hosts do not get this....Farrah has provided a high end, adjustable bed with top of the line linens. Great! Keurig coffee and tea available. Bathroom items you may have forgotten, all right there. Clean and tidy and I loved the outside patio to sit and relax and enjoy the water. Fish if you like, from the dock. Message Farrah if you have any questions, she answers very quickly. Looking forward to going back and recommend this as an affordable getaway......."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had the honor of being Farrah’s first guests! Farrah has a really lovely home, and it was such a relaxing and peaceful place to be. We were looking for a quiet, open spot off the beaten path to watch the ring of fire eclipse and the lakefront guest house worked out perfectly. It was looking a little cloudy the day of the eclipse, but things cleared up just in time and we got to watch the whole thing unfold! Farrah even went above and beyond and bought us eclipse glasses so we could watch it safely!
We arrived after dark our first evening, so I was very thankful for the clear directions and the photos Farrah provided. The guest house was cozy, clean, and beautifully decorated and we loved spending time on the screened in porch for coffee and an evening meal. It’s all set up very nicely with a full size fridge and hot plate and toaster oven/air fryer. Farrah was friendly and helpful. We highly recommend her space highly to anyone!"

The cutest enclosed patio space ever, a record player with great selection of records, comfy pillows and vintage decor. The house just exudes love. It was really hard leaving and I can only hope I will be back soon because great memories were made the few days I was here with my mom and son.

Stayed about a week","We absolutely loved staying at Gwynetta's cottage! We stayed there for nine nights at the end of July when the heat index was around 115 degrees during the day. Since it is an older farmhouse, we expected it to be warm inside the house due to drafty windows, etc. That wasn't the case though and it was so comfortable! The A/C kept up just fine and we even had to turn it down a couple times as it was getting too cool for us. The cupboards were well stocked, everything was clean and there were no odd smells anywhere. We didn't get a chance to meet Gwynetta, but she told us she was close by for anything we might need. She never insisted that we meet her, as some AirBNB hosts do. We also wondered if traffic noise would be an issue since the house is pretty close to the freeway, but we never noticed any, and having quick freeway access was really nice. The host, house and location were perfect and we would love to come back. Thank you Gwynetta!"

It’s conveniently located for quick and easy access to Corpus Christi , just 15 minutes from downtown and the Lexington, and 10 minutes to a couple HEBs. Checkin was a breeze, and everything in the house was clean, comfortable, and ready for arrival. Gwynetta is a wonderful host who is kind and responsive. Similarly, checkout was also a breeze with clear and simple instructions. The kitchen is well supplied for any cooking needs, though be sure to bring your own spices and condiments if you plan to chef it up. The NEMA 14-50 plug by the carport is a nice plus for EV charging. While the house is near a highway and train tracks, we barely noticed any noise from them in daily life. We found the home very comfortable and quiet, a nice retreat from the city."

Stayed a few nights","The house was just as described. Great location for the fairgrounds and only 24 minutes to downtown Corpus Christi. About the same to the beach. Plenty of clean towels and a long driveway. Which was great because we had 3 vehicles this weekend.
The house is an old style farmhouse with lots of character and history. Very convenient to the fairgrounds and nice and cool. it was 100-105 during our stay and it felt great to walk inside and it be in the 70's. Just off the highway but zero road noise.
Which was awesome. Location made it quick and easy to access the highway.
Gwynetta was proactive in letting us know the check in information and made recommendations of where to eat, etc.
Overall a great experience, we would stay there again."

Stayed with kids","Our family was so happy to have a non-hotel option for visiting our Robstown family. This home was perfect for my husband, 1 year old and I. Plenty of room for her pack and play in either bedroom, and a clean environment for her to crawl around and explore!
Kitchen was well stocked and I prepared dinner easily with the tools available after a trip to the grocery store.
Beds were extremely comfortable (would be extra great if one was a King 😉) and the linens were soft. Really appreciated the easy access to electrical outlets (with USB ports) in the bedroom I slept in.
I love the charm and effort put forth to honor this home that clearly means so much to their family. It’s a wonderful mix of vintage decor and more modern amenities, tastefully updated.
Gwynetta was a lovely host and very responsive for the few questions I had. Her instructions made the stay super easy! Will absolutely book again if she’ll have us. ❤️"

The host responds VERY quickly to any questions you might have. The location is easy to locate and very accessible to the interstate. We used this lovely property to ""wagon-wheel"" to various destinations by day and return for a restful, pleasant night's sleep each evening. The beds are SO comfortable! The HVAC unit works fabulous. We stayed nice and cool, even though the outside heat index exceeded 100 degrees! The overhang on the garage, allowed shade for the front of our mini van, during the hot, sunny hours of the afternoon. It was great to have such a spacious refrigerator/freezer at our disposal. We would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for comfortable, very clean (a high priority during this time of health concerns) lodging in the Corpus Christi, Robstown, Lake City, Sandia, Bishop & Kingsville area."

Stayed with a pet","We were in town visiting my son in his freshman year at school, and felt right at home! Omar was incredibly proactive with communication, and my son in particular loved the full sized washer and dryer so mom could do his laundry 😂 our dogs loved the big backyard, and so did we - it was a really neat space to relax. At first glance the neighborhood seemed a little worrisome, but we quickly changed our mind - we never felt unsafe, and although in a college town near campus we were never disturbed with loud parties nearby. I would absolutely stay again!"

The neighbors are friendly and keep to themselves. I had many packages delivered and had no issues with any of those packages disappearing. Unfortunately Kingsville does not take care of their streets which has nothing to do with this house. The house is in walking distance to the college campus which is lit up while it's dark so you are able to take walks and runs at anytime of the day. The house was very clean and has a good set up. The house has open floor plan so you don't feel crowded. There was a nice little patio in backyard. The Backyard was clean and cut. The Owner had good communication with me and did check periodically to make sure I had everything I needed. The check in and check out was very simple and fast. I would stay here again if I am in the area and would suggest it to others.

Stayed a few nights","The place is not bad, but the bed sheets were not clean which is a deal breaker especially without a washer and dryer. I asked for clean sheets, but the spare sheets were also not so clean. I would have spent money on repairs before all those decisions. Altogether it was cheap and decent enough for us.
Replace the rusty window in the bathroom.
Install exhaust vent in the bathroom.
Clean out mold building up in the AC.
there was a smell of stagnant water that was either the bathroom sink not draining properly or the AC unit.
Wash the sheets the day of guest check in.
It's really not a bad place to stay. If it had a little more love, it would be great."

Stayed with kids",So at first the house looks really ugly and run down but once you get inside it’s a lot better. Definitely renovated. Cute decor and even had toys available for my son to play with. Communication was minimal. I guess I thought I was paying $300 for 2 nights so I thought it was a great deal. But it was only one night and we arrived at 7pm and had to leave by 11am so not worth the money I paid in my pure opinion. But the experience was decent. My mother in law even said it’s very clean and she’s very picky.

My dad was inducted in to the Tejano roots hall of fame and came as a family. My dad said he “had a really good nights sleep and hadn’t had that in a while”. Me and my family played scrabble , and domino’s. We totally forgot about the karioke machine but we had fun. We also made a big Breakfast and dinner without any problems. My son even made some Eggo’s with the toaster. For Dinner we had spaghetti as one of the meals. The home had window units and heaters and I was hesitant about it at first but it was actually REALLY warm in the home for the winter. Me and my family would definitely stay again when we come back to Alice, TX."

While it’s an older house, they’ve done a good job fixing it up for guests. As my kids said, the place has good vibes (and that’s not only because that’s what the art on the wall said). Beds were comfortable and the house was clean and stocked with all basic necessities. When we arrived, space heaters were running so the house was at a comfortable temperature (which was a nice touch). Communication was great and the check in/out process was easy. We would stay definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","The Gulf Breeze Alpaca Farm is a delightful place to stay if you are visiting the South Texas Coastal region near or around Lake Mathis. Although the Farm itself does not have direct access to the Lake the State Park is only a short distance from the front gate of the 40 acre farm. And Lake Mathis is visible through some of the South Texas shrub brush from the cabin.
However, the assortment of not only Alpacas, but Gulf Coast Sheep, Ducks, Chickens, Roosters, Nargansette and Red Bourbon Turkeys enhance the landscape and create the total experience of farm life. In addition there are the gorgeous barn cats and the friendly, spectacular guard dogs of both the flock and herd. The dogs greet you coming and going and are irresistible to not spend time petting.
This farm is far enough from the lights of Corpus Christi to enjoy the amazing big night sky of Texas and quite for a restful evenings sleep on a good mattress in a well appointed bed."

Lyn was there to meet Amy and all needs for us! The farm was amazing! The only thing was the Texas heat! If I wasn’t such a sissy to it I know I would have spent way more time with the animals and on the GORGEOUS screened in back porch!!! This is definitely a place I can’t wait to enjoy during the fall or winter! Everything is there for down time… Satellite TV, puzzles, microwave, and fridge."

The alpacas are adorable along with all the other animals including the superstar Titus. I highly recommend this and their other bookings! You won’t regret it."

Out host was super friendly and was happy to provide some impromptu farm show-and-tell sessions. The farm is about 45 minutes from Corpus, making a very convenient day trip. Absolutely loved it here!"

The property offers spectacular views both early morning and dusk. I highly recommend staying here. The experience is memoriable.
Lynn and her son are sweet, very accommodating and really care about what they do. We will be visiting again soon."

The animals are all really neat, we met turkeys, chickens, ducks, sheep, cats, dogs..... and, of course, the Alpaca, which are definitely a favorite for us.
Lyn is extremely knowledgeable and open to explaining everything that goes on. We also met her son, who is an exceptional artist!
In a nutshell, Gulf Breeze is the place to stay in the Mathis area, and we look forward to any excuse to return."

We were able to chat with them a bit during our visit and I loved hearing their stories and seeing their passion for what they do.
The animals are of course the highlight of this trip! The dogs are brilliant, they are so sweet and do an amazing job protecting the livestock. We fell in love with them instantly, Silas will forever have a place in my heart.
The alpaca are precious and the turkeys are hilarious. There was never a dull moment!
The cabins were extremely clean and comfortable, exactly as described.
I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a truly unique experience and anyone who loves animals!"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing experience!
Animal lovers will go crazy at this ranch - there are many different farm animals. All are friendly and used to people. You can tell they are raised with love.
The cabin is sparkling clean. We especially enjoy the screened back porch because we can have dinner while seeing alpacas chilling outside.
While Lyn was very busy preparing an annual big event in the weekend, she and her beautiful family still spent quite some time with us, showing us around the farm. They stopped by our cabin to say hello when they took the baby sheep out for a walk.
Because of their hospitality, it almost felt like we were visiting in our aunt and uncles farm. It is nice now there are still Airbnb hosts treating their guests like friends and families instead of just paid customers. Would recommend to everyone."

Breakfast was provided for us in the kitchenette - English muffins, butter and jam, orange juice and coffee. We loved seeing all the animals and felt safe under the watch of Titus, the guardian dog. When we first arrived, we didn’t remember which of the three cabins was ours. Titus knew, and showed us the way to our cabin. What a champ! At night, he was posted up on the picnic table to keep away wild animals. And he did it all with a smile on his “good boy” face. Thanks again, Lyn, we’ll definitely stay here again when we visit my mom in Orange Grove."
