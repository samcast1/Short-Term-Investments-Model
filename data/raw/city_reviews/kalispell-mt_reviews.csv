It was super easy to get to and the neighborhood and neighbors were very welcoming. Everything you could ever need was available for you, including the laundry facilities.

Stayed a few nights",The house was great for a weekend with my sisters. It was close to restaurants and a grocery store. The neighborhood was quiet and the house was very neat and clean. Marsha was a great host. She contacted me ahead of time to provide instructions and even had the house ready for us early since we were coming from another event. It's a great place for a family base camp or a girls' weekend! Highly recommend.

Stayed a few nights","This is our 4th stay in Kalispell or the surrounding communities for the 4th of July holiday. The A/C worked great (many rentals don't have it), and there wasn't a ""no shoes inside"" policy! It had lots of space for 4 adults and their computers, large refrigerator, cavernous w/d, and PLENTY of hot water. Adjustable bed and walk-in shower in master were bonuses. There was no clutter, but everything you could need was there in the pantry, mud room, a drawer, or cabinet. The floorplan is great for privacy (bathrooms are located between bedrooms), and neighbor noise was nonexistent.
Marsha was responsive, yet casual, and had thought of everything. I'd definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","In the Kalispel market, this was a great value for our family on a weekend soccer tourney trip! Marsha was the consummate host! Great communicator, innovative with all of the creature comforts and keenly aware of our travel with kids. Great collection of toys for littles while also providing games for older kids and adults. The back yard is expansive and the patio was a great spot to chill out.
Kitchen was super and we were grateful for the washer and dryer for getting the grass-stains out of uniforms at the end of the day! Comfortable beds made for a good night's sleep. The reclining sofa was great to watch a baseball game on TV. We just really enjoyed the whole place and experience.
Highly recommended place and especially the host!"

Group trip",This property has everything you need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. We liked being in the town of Kalispell because at the end of the day we could grab a bite to eat and then head home to shower and relax for the next day. We visited Whitefish on one day and went to Glacier National Park for white water rafting another. Then we did Going-to-the-Sun road and the third day for hiking and it was a good location for city amenities yet only a 30-40 minute drive to the other destinations. Drinking coffee on the porch in the morning and looking at the mountains was a special thing for myself and my husband. It was a perfect way to start our days of running and playing. We would absolutely stay at this property again and we highly recommend it.

Stayed a few nights","Cherie's place was a GREAT find! I was searching for a ""stay-cation"" to lift my mood (January-February can be so dreary!) and her cozy upstairs space was perfect! It was so peaceful and decorated so warmly, I walked in and immediately felt relaxed. She had an area with a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, tea, coffee, toaster oven, etc-so everything I needed! She even had water bottles in the fridge so when I arrived, I was able to sit and enjoy something cold and refreshing. The private hot tub was my main draw to this Airbnb and it did not disappoint! So clean and well-maintained, it was one of the nicest hot tubs I have been in at an Airbnb. I asked what the hours for the hot tub were and Cherie told me I could use it whenever because it did not interfere with their schedule-that was such a blessing! Cherie was very kind and considerate and communicated very well. I was impressed with the entire experience and I'm looking forward to visiting again! Thank you, Cherie!"

Stayed a few nights","Thanks Cherie for many nice board games and the hot tub! It made our time very fun. In general our stay was good, but there were some things that I would want to be better. I will start from good: the location is very nice, peaceful and calm. The room was fine, it was quite clean and felt cozy. The bad things were that the mattress was hard to sleep on, it makes A LOT of noise whatever movement you make (so I would wake up in the night if my husband moves or whatnot), it would bounce when you sit on it and moreover, you can feel that your head is lower then your feet, basically I mean that it was a bit inclined 🤔 I have no idea why… We had some problems with internet, but Cherie said that usually it works fine. Another thing is that they left a very small amount of shampoo, conditioner and body wash for us, it was barely enough for two days. It was fine with me since I had my own shampoo, but felt bad that they didn’t take care of it. In general, an ok stay but I wouldn’t come back"

Stayed a few nights","Oh My Goodness, what a stay! I loved everything about it: the peace and quiet of the location, the coziness of the room, the warm and delicious coffee cake at my doorstep at one morning, the beauty and serenity of the backyard (a whole family of deers came to visit while I was in the hot tub). I took advantage of the hot tub all over my stay and it's absolutely amazing. I loved how close to the lake it was and that they had kayaks included in the stay! What a plus. I stayed for 3 nights and left very relaxed. Cherie communicate very well and gave clear instructions and even let me check in earlier since it was a rainy Monday. Kitchenette very helpful since I am a road tripper always carrying a cooler with my own food. Highly recommend Notch trail at Herron Park (not even a mile from the house), top view of Treasure Island at Foys Lake (great turquoise water when the sun is out) and super easy hike and well marked trail. Made me love Airbnb all over again!"

Cherie's snug above-garage abode offers everything you need, not to mention a private hot tub where one can peek at grazing deer, and then topped off by a hot, fragrant treat of coffee cake placed by the door for morning consumption!
It truly is moving, the effort folks like Cherie take, to give others a great time!"

I met Cherie’s husband who was working outside when I arrived and had a good brief conversation with him. Other than that I did not see them the rest of my stay, but they were responsive to messages and happy to answer any questions.
Price was competitive with mid-range hotels in the area, but quality was significantly better. Above and beyond standard hotel room amenities, just about everything has been thought of - from kayaks, to books and movies, to even plastic wrap in the kitchenette. Internet appears to be Starlink. Download speed was approximately 35 Mbps, not blazing fast but better than most hotels (plenty to see in the area though - didn’t use it much!)."

We were able to access Foys Lake within 2min drive from the house. Jacuzzi in the backyard was super relaxing. Saw a black bear chasing deer from the backyard :)
The house is smaller than the pictures but very efficient. There was a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee machine in the unit. The smart TV was able to access Netflix. There was a portable A/C unit to keep the unit cool. The unit can be a bit toasty even with the A/C during the day + early evening (the temperature was around 85F during our stay), and the windows could not be opened for the breeze. We kept the blinds closed the entire time the second day and the unit felt much cooler.
Cherie was super responsive and has extremely well communication. The coffee cake she baked was extraordinary!"

They had amazing suggestions of local things to do, and I felt like I had the inside information the whole trip. I went on the most epic hike of my life off the hosts suggestion. Went kayaking on the lake below the house in the morning. It was a total zen experience mixed with the rustic feel of wild Montana! The property is simply unbelievable. Amazing and serine views of the lake and mountains. I felt like I was in a dream looking around and thought I booked the wrong property because it was so beautiful. This AirBb is VERY cozy and well thought out. It is clear that a lot of time and effort went into making guests feel welcome and cared for. This was an amazing stay. I have never been treated with such hospitality from the hosts. I only regret that I did not book more nights here! Thank you both so much!!!"

The coffee cake was a nice touch and delicious. Her place is in an above garage apartment with stairs, and you are attached to their home. However, it still seemed fairly private. I didn’t see anyone while I was there. If I had more time I would have gone tail running/hiking behind the house at Lone Pine. It’s beautiful with lots of trails and right behind the house."

Stunning view during the day and can stargaze during the night. And owners are very friendly, accommodating, and easy to communicate. We needed a weight scale during our stay, and they went out of their way to provide it for us. The only thing that may bother people is if you have a bigger group of people staying, the wifi reception won’t be the best at times. Other than that, nothing to complain about! Thank you for having us! Would definitely try coming back to this BNB if I ever visit Kalispell again in the future."

Group trip","We had a wonderful stay at Rosie’s! Although we were a little farther outside of West Glacier it was nice to be far away from all the tourist and noise. The deck was a peaceful retreat for morning coffee and family gathering in the evening for dinner and stories of the day. We saw deer, turkeys, woodpeckers, chatty squirrels and a bat! We celebrated two birthdays while visiting- MT was a perfect birthday gift! The house was perfect size for my family which included me, my husband, 13 yr and 3 yr old, grandma and grandpa. We all had space to spread out for quiet time without being on top of one another. Was nice to have a fully furnished kitchen which was essential with restaurants being far away or closing early. Definitely plan ahead and hit up the grocery early in your trip. The house was very clean and stocked with plenty of towels, toilet paper, tissues, etc. Austin was a great host, very responsive! You won’t regret staying at Rosie’s Hideaway, we can’t wait to come back.

Very clean home, new kitchen appliances, & a big deck with outdoor dining table to eat meals on. Good location for the rustic Polebridge entrance to Glacier NP, about a 1.5 hr drive. Overall, had a good stay for our three nights at this rental."

I loved the furniture in the place, especially the standing desk that can move up and down. The furniture pieces and decorations were beautiful as well. Wish I had the same talent in furnishing my own place, but will draw some inspiration from you guys.
I had a great time in Kalispell, flathead lake, and glacier national park. Albeit I maybe came a bit too early as most of Glacier National Park was still not open.
I'll have to come back again in the summer when more stuff opens up!"

Stayed with a pet",Very nice stay. Joe was fast to respond to a minor issue that was due to technology but he was quick with a solution! The place was like walking into a photo from a magazine. You can tell they take pride in these spaces and care about guests experiences. Nice stay and would stay again should the chance arise. My dog Oscar really enjoyed the little spot they set up for him too. That was a nice surprise I have never had before. Thanks Joe and Katie!

We never looked for a thermostat to adjust cause the temperature was naturally comfortable. King bed was super comfortable. Organic sheets were extremely soft and smelled excellent!
It was like living in a house; it was so cozy. Joe was excellent at communicating, quick to respond and very kind."

Stayed over a week","If you ever need a place to stay in Kalispell, this is the place! My husband and I needed a place to stay for two weeks while we were waiting to move into our apartment. Although it’s located downtown (which makes it super central to everything you could possibly need), the unit itself was very quiet, private, and clean. You can tell a lot of care went into planning these suites to make them cozy and well equipped. The bathroom came stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body soap, and hand soap, the kitchen had dish soap, and they even supplied a few laundry pods! The check-in and check-out process was also super easy and convenient. Joe and his wife are both super friendly and were always quick to respond whenever we needed to reach out. If the situation ever arises that we need a place to stay, we would definitely return and I would highly recommend to anyone else looking for a “suite” place to stay in Kalispell."

My husband appreciated the large desk for his tech in the spacious living room. Doing our laundry was a big bonus, and the full kitchen made us feel at home. The area was peaceful and we felt safe. Katie was quick to correspond with me, and checking in and out was a breeze.

Everything was well done. Dishwasher was broken and they left a note of it and asked to leave the plates in the kitchen sink, which was not a big deal for us.
Check in/ out experience was great and easy. Communication was excellent.

The location was ideal for exploring Glacier National Park, Whitefish, and Flathead Lake. Since I was going in all directions, this was a central spot. I even caught a rodeo at Blue Moon Arena, which was just a short drive away.
The place felt like a great landing pad after all my outings, and Crystal was really friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a convenient and cozy spot to stay while checking out all the fun stuff in the area, I highly recommend this Airbnb!"

The house was spotless and had everything I needed. The kitchen was great for cooking, and the living room was so cozy for unwinding after a long day. Plus, I fired up the grill one evening and it was a real treat!
Crystal was an amazing host! She was really friendly and quick to respond with great tips on local spots and restaurants. The check-in was super smooth, and you could tell she put a lot of effort into making sure guests feel welcome.
Being close to Glacier National Park and Flathead Lake was a huge plus—it made getting to all the outdoor adventures really easy. I loved the little touches like the welcome basket and the handy guidebook.
I totally recommend staying at Crystal’s place if you’re heading to Kalispell. It was even better than I expected, and I can’t wait to come back!"

Two cars can be parked in the allotted space. Deer frequent the property during the day (and night!), and they’re tonnes of fun to watch. As the space is all on one level and requires no stairs, it’s great for those of us with mobility issues.
As far as communication, Joe was very responsive when we needed to get in touch and was extremely accommodating to our needs (for example, extending our stay due to an unforeseen incident with our car). We appreciated that and would book again if welcomed."

Big Fork is a great little town with Flathead Lake steps away from the property. We woke up in the morning and sat up in awe at the beauty of the lake through the trees.

Also the bathroom is a porta potty (literally) - so important to note - it is truly a tree house/tent. Furniture is in decent condition, but lacks the frills of a glamping experience w/ the high cost associated. There is a wood-oven fire place inside which does heat up nicely, but like any other fire place it requires ongoing attn. Beautiful lake view and host was very responsive and communicative. The views were incredible, and some great nearby restaurants - Bonfire was amazing ^chef’s kiss, as well as Pocketstone Cafe!"

Stayed a few nights","Kat’s place is a MUST stay!!!!!! Staying here has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Everything about this cabin has brought me back to my childhood and given me a chance to relive memories I thought I had long forgotten. It’s brought me back to many years ago with the smells of nature and the hiking trails right outside our steps. We got the most out of the sauna, the cold plunge, and the private outdoor shower. Kat is great at communicating, anytime we needed something, or had questions about local things to do, Kat was there with a quick response and many options to make us feel at home. Kat even brought us over delicious cherries. We picked cherries from the trees leading to the cabin, they were the freshest cherries I have ever tasted. This cabin offers a ton of privacy. This place was beautiful and just what we needed to relax and get back down to earth. We are so thankful and grateful for Kat and this wonderful cabin, we definitely plan on coming back soon."

Stayed one night","This stay was INCREDIBLE. From the moment we pulled up and saw it (it looked even better than the pictures) to the moment we very sadly had to leave, we were just blown away. The basics for a place of this price were met (comfy bed and bedding, quality soaps and shampoos, everything set to make an impression), and so much more beyond that. The space is obviously well-loved and Kat clearly cares about her guests. I am a regular traveler and my expectations were exceeded. The only thing I wish was that I had booked longer.
There were clear, easy to follow instructions for the sauna, shower, and plunge tub, and Kat was very responsive, even recommending other local hikes. I cannot wait to book again!"

Stayed a few nights",this was our 2nd stay at Kats Treehouse Tent and we had time to fire up the sauna and use the cold plunge but my favorite was still the hot outdoor shower under the stars after all that. One night I sat in the real comfy tilt back chairs on the deck and listened to the lil mountain spring trickle by while I watched the sun go down across the lake behind the mountains as a lightening storm rolled in it was electrifying ha. First night was warm especially w all of Kats luxurious sheets and comforters on the king bed second night I think it got down to 50 so we made a fire in the wood stove and warmed things up before we settled into the second night of the greatest sleep ever. its not far off the road/up the mountain side .... but it feels a world away from everything once you're up on the platform listening to all the birds and nature sounds its a real nature retreat we'll be back :-)

Stayed one night",I stayed in Kats Orchard Tent a couple times last year n thought that was about the most peaceful special lil spot I ever slept for 11 hours in a king bed ... this past weekend i stayed in her new Treehouse Mountain Tent - WOW - its just a couple hundred yards up the mountain into a dense forest of Douglas Fir some of which gotta be 200 yrs old can't get your arms around 'em kinda trees ...... the tent is up in the trees on a huge platform overlooking everything with a view of Flathead Lake between the trees ... inside is as luxurious as the Orchard Tent I dunno where she gets these rugs but beautiful colors w comfy futon to sit and warm by the Hearthstone wood stove w the tent flaps open its really a unique fun vibe to sit up there after going in n outta the wood fired sauna and cold plunge for awhile ... and the stars ... next time ima hike up the trail to the spot w the gigantic view of Flathead :-)

He really cares about the people around him, and that’s a valuable trait to have in the world in which we live. If you get a chance to stop in and stay here, you absolutely won’t regret it.

It is perfect for couples, a small family or (like us) a partnership. There really isn’t a primary suite, both bedrooms are spacious. Also, although this is a condo, the two units do not share a common wall (garages share the wall) so it is very quiet, even with another person using the second unit. We were thrilled our F-350 truck was able to park in the garage ( temps in the 20’s) Everthing was very organized, easy to use and we loved having access to a bread maker and crockpot. Joe was very responsive if we had an inquiry. It’s a wonderful place to stay. We will be back."

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay when visiting Glacier National Park and surrounding areas. Close to several restaurants, breweries, and outdoors activities. The 2 bathrooms were great even with just 2 adults. The use of the garage was a plus and something that is not common with most rentals.
The house was as described. We knew when renting the house did not have A/C. We did not know we chose the hottest week of the year to stay in Montana. This did not impact our rating even though it took until late in the night or even early morning to cool down. An inexpensive air chiller would do wonders and ensure future guests don't hold the heat against a 5 star rating"

Stayed a few nights","I was a little worried at first because this was our 2nd time booking an Airbnb somewhere in Montana and for the second time, our Airbnb host double booked us with another guest. However, being that this place is a duplex, they simply put us on the other side of the home so it ended up not being an inconvenience whatsoever. The host was SO responsive when I messaged them which I loved. They were super friendly, too. Out of all the vastly different Airbnbs I've stayed in, this one makes the top of the list. We had four adults in our group. The home was plenty spacious, decorated very cute, and super clean. What a relief! I looked around and couldn't find any dirt, stains, hair, etc. All four of us were impressed. I especially appreciated that they didn't have a ton of over the top rules for cleaning the space when we left; they just wanted dirty dishes in the dishwasher and dirty linens in the bathroom. No biggie!
Highly recommend if cleanliness + space is priority for you!"

Stayed a few nights","Joe's Airbnb was exactly what we needed for our Glacier National Park trip! The house was extremely clean and had everything you could ask for typically (smart TV, great WiFi, kitchen utensils, full spice rack, coffee maker, toaster, etc.) - perfect for two couples or a family of 4. To add to that, they even had a yoga mat, a few box fans (much needed in the summer), and gave access to the enclosed garage space for parking.
They are extremely responsive hosts and do everything to ensure you have the most pleasant stay! In terms of connectivity, you'll need a car for quick access to tons of coffee shops, restaurants, and groceries in downtown Kalispell (all within 5-10mins). Whitefish is about 20-25mins away, and the West Glacier entrance is about 45mins away.
100% would recommend this property!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was very clean and nicely furnished. The descriptions and pictures were accurate. Loved the garage. They had nice pots and pans, and small appliances. I didn’t get to use them. They even had different kinds of cooking oil and all basic items.
When we reached there, it was unusually hot, so we were a bit concerned about not having air conditioner. But the fan cooled the place well. They even had additional fan if we needed.
Worked during our stay. WiFi connection was really good.
So many shops and restaurants within 15 minutes. Glacier park west entrance is 20 minutes from the place and we drove to the park and the entire going to the sun road after four when you don’t need a vehicle reservation.
Joe was so nice, we had a chance to meet him and had a great conversation. He gave a lot of suggestions regarding local places.
Will certainly stay there and recommend this place to my family and friends."

So I you have 4 coffee drinking adults, you would have to make a couple of pots. They also had a French press so you could use both. I really liked having 2 bathrooms and a garage to park the car in."

Two minor issues:
Kitchen was clean and very well set up, but the dishwasher did not work. Not a big deal and host will fix it. Just couldn’t resolve it during our brief stay.
There was construction or something nearby and trucks were noisy on the weekday mornings. Not the host’s fault."

Stayed a few nights","The stay at Joe’s was good. There is ample kitchen stuff. Tv is good, if I have one qualm it is that one must crank the volume on the telly when the clothes washer and the dishwasher are on! A minor qualm it is, as I was happy to be able to wash my clothes, and the drying rack was MUCH appreciated because I prefer to air dry over using a dryer. Also I appreciate that there are additional bedding because I like to be cozy in bed but not hot, so I turn the heat down but add a blanket or two. The nicer touches were the soft Kleenex and products provided in the shower, which worked well. The less one has to take with them on a trip, the better. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable excellent place to stay in Kalispell."
