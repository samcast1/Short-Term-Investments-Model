Stayed with kids","5/5 stars all the way around. I had gotten a last minute air bnb for my 2 year old and I. Shantell and her parents were extremely friendly, welcoming and had great hospitality. Shantell’s (host) mom and dad (cohosts) stay in the upper part of the house that has a separate entrance. Upon arrival my tires were really low. Kevin had noticed and filled them up to make sure my daughter and I were safe for departure. Jaki had made us an amazing breakfast in the morning making us feel even more welcomed. Although a short stay; I wish we could’ve stayed longer! Definitely would stay here again and recommend to friends coming to visit!"

Stayed about a week",Very nice place. Full basement and updated upstairs. There are 4 queen beds but she also provides two air mattresses in the closet that you can set up anywhere. Hannah provided excellent service and provided extra towels and sheets. The beds are extremely comfortable and spacious. The entire place was well cleaned. The only thing I would warn you of is the driveway which has a very large dip so beware if you have lower cars. I have a Nissan Sentra and it did scrape a couple times. But overall this place is amazing and well worth the price and time.

Stayed about a week","Hannah's place was homey and welcoming. There were only 3 of us staying, but this place could easily sleep a much later group. Probably better for a big active group. We stayed in most of the time as my husband was recovering from surgery. Therefore the only negative for us was that the kitchen and dining area was minimally supplied. If your group is active and out and about most of the time, this shouldn't be much of a problem. However, we ate in and tried to cook a Christmas dinner there which was a bit of a challenge. We were warm and comfortable and the beds are great. It's just that this place is a better match for a larger group that eat breakfast and lunch in and goes out for dinner. Loved the old hardwood floors."

Stayed with kids","Hannah's place is exactly as it is described and exactly what the photos show. Hannah's communication was amazing and almost always responded in less than an hour. For the most part it was a great stay. However, there were 2 big things (big for me, might not bother others) that made me rate it 3 stars. Privacy is important to me and my family. We traveled with young children and all the curtains in the living room and kitchen are see through and there was no window covering over the window above the kitchen sink. Especially at night with lights on. Anyone could easily see straight into the house. The other thing that really bothered us was that we couldn't turn off the porch light. This made bugs a huge problem as the porch light and the living room light was right next to the front door. therefore Everytime we opened the front door mosquitos and other bugs came into the house."

There are four double beds, but keep in mind that there’s just really seating for a maximum of four adults in the living room, and there’s only a small table for two in the kitchen. Lovely towels and hot shower. Huge front and back yard and plenty of parking in the driveway for several cars. Thanks, Hannah & Gator, for a great visit."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Hannah’s place was great. We were there for a family reunion. The home was spotless and everything in working condition with some food staples available. We did have a problem with the upstairs too hot even with the air on and a lack of towels for 6 guests. Upon contacting the host early in the morning, Hannah was there within 2 hours or so with extra towels since other guest must have “ borrowed” them, and with 2 exhaust fans for the upstairs windows as well as a circulating fan to help the air condition cool off the upstairs which made it comfortable to sleep upstairs. She was very friendly and set up the fans and left blow up beds if we still had an issue. She was in and out within 10 minutes or less as not to encroach upon our visit. The beds were extra comfortable and we all slept well. We were feeling just like home, then it was time to leave. We would stay there again if in Youngstown."

There is a huge ceiling bubble in the kitchen ceiling which grew concern thinking it would burst with water. Very tidy place, but not alot of privacy because the neighbors can see right into the home with lack of curtains. Some food left on couch from previous guests. I'd stay again just because the area is quiet and the fenced in yard but this place needs alot of improvements."

They have a binder upon walk in with instructions, WiFi, literally everything you’ll need for the stay is in that binder. The house smelled amazing , was very clean, and super cute inside. I will say if you shower put about two towels down as thier isn’t a shower door so to say so water gets out easily with the kiddos. Other than that our stay was literally perfect! Also definitely check out Millcreek Park! The “Cinderella Bridge” is beautiful!!!! We would definitely stay here again, thank you Kelly!"

This was an awesome find for our family and doggie. It’s within 5 min of groceries, gas, pizza, our favorite church Sovereign Grace Chapel, and a new coffee shop. There are new appliances, a washer and dryer, Roku TVs in every room, a cozy electric fire place, fenced in back yard, and THE BEST MATTRESSES in every room….we slept like kings lol.
We will def be saving this location for our future trips to Youngstown.
Kelly was also such a wonderful host. We had to come to Ohio for a family emergency and ended up to stay longer for an unexpected funeral. Kelly was very responsive and kind and really just helped us feel like she was family. Thank you so much."

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay at Kelly and her family’s place! Kelly was very responsive and was extremely flexible with us about our trip. We appreciate it immensely because it allowed us to see our family when we couldn’t for Christmas. We brought our two dog travel buddies, who also loved the place, and probably our favorite part was the beautiful and large fenced back yard. The fence was fine for our big dogs but may not work for a little dog/ escape artists. The place was clean and cute and we felt right at home. We really appreciated the coffee and snacks. Would stay again :)"

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay at The Pink Door while in town visiting family. It was the perfect place for my husband and me, our three kids (ages 13, 15, and 17) and our dog. The beds were comfy and a nice surprise was that the third bedroom/office had a bed instead of a pull-out sofa so our son was excited about that. The decor was so cute, especially in the living room and kitchen. Everything we needed was provided and Kelly was super communicative throughout the entire booking process. An added bonus is that it’s less than a mile from our fave pizza place - Belleria! Would definitely recommend The Pink Door!"

The home was decorated very tastefully. She even has some games and books. Also we really loved the smart tv that we could just log into our apps and it would log us out at check out. Usually we have to use our fire stick. Kelly also was super quick responding to any questions we had. She even allowed us to check out a little late when my husband had a work meeting that morning.

Stayed with kids","This house was exactly what we needed for this trip! We came to see family over the holidays and the house was a peaceful getaway amid lots of visiting! Our kids had plenty of space to play and unwind - they loved the games, books, and snacks provided. They also enjoyed playing in the back yard (when it wasn't raining)! My favorite part was the heated floors! The house was a little harder to find (gps told us to turn earlier than we were supposed to), but the lights were on and everything was ready for us! We are thankful that we had the opportunity to stay at this house!"

Updated and pristine condition with lots of little touches to make it feel like home. Snacks and water were available in the kitchen as well as laundry facilities. TVs in each room, and a high chair and playpen made it great for our granddaughter. I highly recommend staying at The Pink Door and I will return."

We were there for a wedding at the nearby Maronite Center and it was super convenient. I have already recommended to our friends that they use this place when they need more housing for visitors.

While it was not in walking distance for us, it was just a short drive to get where we were going - a great place to stay for an event at the Covelli Centre.

Stayed with kids","Everything was great, will plan to stay again if needed. Only very minor issues with the house, no bath soap or body wash. Each bath had a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. Finally found a bar of soap in a box in one of the drawers but if you want body wash bring your own. Also we didn't have any need for additional toilet paper there was enough there, but they don't provide additional so might need to get some for yourself depending on length of stay. Finally, only other very minor issue was lack of working light bulbs, it seemed that just about every light fixture was missing 1 or more working bulbs. In master bath half of the bulbs above sink were out. House was very clean, plenty of room for our needs, kitchen had everything needed although the coffee pot provided worked but needs some attention."

Stayed with kids","Very cozy place, large kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, master bathroom, plenty of closet space. Extremely clean. Plenty of extra linens, comfortable beds. The digital keypad made easy entry for both of us families arriving at slightly different times. Easy access to major highways. Owners were very reachable and friendly for checkin and a simple question we had. Neighborhood felt safe.
Location is a bit noisier than a neighborhood, as it is on a 4 lane 35mph road. Wifi is DSL and isn't extremely fast, but was adequate for normal surfing, not sure if remotely working would be smooth or streaming multiple HD video streams, but that's not why we were there. It's probably all that is available in the area.
Overall, this is a great place to stay in Youngstown and we would stay there again."

Stayed with kids","Theresa easily accommodated our last-minute booking (we were in town for a family emergency) and was very patient as we communicated with her about potentially adding other family members to our reservation. We weren't able to meet her during our stay, but she checked in on us and we were able to check-in easily.
The space is immaculate and wide-open. It was well situated for our needs, and we loved that we were so close to Mill Creek Park. All of the basics were covered!
Our only negative feedback is that we did not find the beds or pillows to be comfortable. I know this is frequently a matter of preference, but looking back at the listing photos I can actually see some sagging that I didn't notice before I booked. To be fair, we did not make the time to contact Theresa during our stay, so it is possible that they may have tried to correct the problem if we had--we simply didn't have the time or emotional bandwidth to handle that among our family obligations.
Otherwise, we wholeheartedly endorse staying at Theresa's place! Thanks again."

The small touches that are included such as dog treats and while I did not have a dog the thoughtfulness is worth mentioning. This thoughtfulness continued as extras in the bathroom linen closet, laundry room, the kids play room and coffee for us early birds. The mattresses were very comfortable and my husband slept better than at home. Thank you Nicole for all you do and thoughtfulness. We will certainly stay again if in area."

Stayed with kids","Nicole was an amazing host. She was super nice and extremely responsive to the few issues we had while we were there and even before booking. We were coming in town for a particular event and needed to know how far away it was-and she was so helpful . While we stayed there, we did have two issues. The WiFi didn’t work for us and the sink in the bathroom was clogged. Nicole did offer to call somebody but it was the half bath, certainly not worth a weekend fee to fix. 🙃 But she responded quickly and offered a solution to that particular issue. The internet never did stay connected. The 🏡 was older & did match the photos. There are improvements that should be made that would help the value paid. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling down and around the sink and toilet it was dirty. The windows and the screens need replaced in the bedroom areas. Nicole had mentioned this being a new listing (I think) and I am sure these little attention to detail things will work as time goes on. ❤️"

Stayed a few nights",I used this house to get ready the morning of my wedding and it was beautiful! It was so cute and spacious. We were able to get some absolutely beautiful pictures before leaving for the church. We had 11 people getting ready with 3 hair and makeup people and a breakfast spread and still had room to hang out and watch TV when it wasn’t your turn. We easily logged into our streaming accounts to watch what we wanted. I also loved waking up there the morning after. The curtains keep the bedroom dark enough to sleep in but the sunlight comes in so beautifully downstairs. I also felt very safe the night I had to stay there alone. Nicole was so sweet and helpful and check in and checkout was so easy and smooth! Couldn’t recommend more!

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for my niece's graduation and this was very convenient to Youngstown State campus, roughly 15 minutes. It's on a quiet tree-lined street with cute older houses. It was a little hard to find when we arrived after dark, so thank goodness for GPS. The house has been updated somewhat, particularly the kitchen. It has plenty of amenities if you want to cook. There's plenty of space in the living area, a good place to hang out with a few family members. There was a kid's play room with some toys, which was nice. The bedrooms were a good size and the bed was comfortable. It's memory foam, which isn't for everyone, but it slept nice. The main bathroom was spruced up and worked well. Of course the shower head is a little low, but it is an old house. It was a little warm while there, so having a newer AC system was a plus. Overall a good visit and a cute little house to stay in versus a cramped hotel room farther away. Nicole is a great host, very communicative."

Group trip","We were in Youngstown to visit family after a death in the family so being close to family with a place to hang out in between was key. The house was really roomy and as someone who lives in an old house, I can say the bedrooms were unusually large and easily fit the king beds with room to spare. Certainly not necessary for us, but nice in comparison to our small bedrooms back home. If you're a runner, it's about 2 miles from Mill Creek Park, so run from here, or easily drive to the park to start your run. Mill Creek is one of our favorite places to run, and we've run in a lot of places! We did do all our cooking, and were cooking some for family. Plenty of room to cook and a full size slow cooker was great. Because we cooked so much, we did need some cooking tools not there, but for most people doing basic cooking, you are fine. Really a great short term living experience during a difficult time. Loved this older house in a residential neighborhood."

Stayed with a pet","Nicole is a great host and we really enjoyed our stay. We arrived early from a 7 hour drive and was allowed early access without an extra charge. The house has plenty of room for the whole family, nicely decorated, well stocked with TP, soap, coffee, etc. and even had dog bowels and treats. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood with plenty of privacy. Our dogs loved the backyard and walking the neighborhood too."

Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Sandusky, Canton, wherever you want to go is an easy drive to this centrally located gem!
This quaint house was very comfortable with six people staying for a week without feeling like we were on top of each other. The laundry in the basement was nice (and we got to teach the younger generation about laundry chutes!)
Overall, a great stay and would definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights","I was in town on business for a few days and did not want to be trapped in a hotel. Erin's place is spacious and bright with room to work and spread out. The instructions to get in were clear and easy to follow, though it helps that I knew the area a little before arriving. Erin was 110% responsive to any questions I had about amenities or the space. The building is being rehabbed (beautifully I might add) so during the day there were a few work people around. But the building is solid as a rock so it was no disturbance to me. Thanks for a comfy stay."

Stayed one night","Erin's place was much nicer than expected! It is a very large space, with 15-foot high ceilings, flooded with wonderful natural light (from west-facing and north-facing windows); with gorgeous warm-tone old wooden floors; comfortable furniture (nicer than what the photos show); a kitchenette with an induction cook-top, microwave, and coffee maker; a fireplace and modern heating; a shower with a pebble floor; nice towels and linens and very comfortable bed. The space was perfect for yoga, dancing, photography, relaxing. It is in an old school building that is being renovated/re-done; on a road with some traffic noise; in a neighborhood that is old-industrial, just off the highway -- none of which bothered us at all. We found it to be peaceful, relaxing, eclectic. And super clean. Kudos to Erin for transforming an historic old school building into an attractive, unique place to stay."

Stayed with a pet","Based on the listing pictures and description I thought this was a fully renovated old school with a bunch of nice apartments in it, but it's really more like a demolition zone with a few finished rooms. The kitchen was a bit rundown and the furniture isn't new and modern like it is in the pics - all the couches and chairs looked like old garage sale buys. The high ceilings were awesome, but the floors are thin so it was hard to sleep through all the noises from the person above me (but it's also not the host's fault that they watching movies UNTIL 4:30 AM with the volume up - I also love Rush Hour 2, just not at 2AM). There's also a lot of traffic noise from the street and the highway, so all in all it was not a great night's sleep, but the studio itself was spacious & warm, the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was nice and looked like it was recently redone. It would have been fine for the night, it was a cool space - just a bit more shabby-chic than I was expecting!"

Stayed a few nights","I was looking for an inexpensive stay near a factory I was visiting for a business trip. I needed something close by the factory that had reliable internet and a kitchen and wanted to avoid a hotel so I could buy groceries and make my meals. Erin's place was exactly that. It was very inexpensive compared to a hotel. The bonus for me was that it was a beautiful light-filled space that was inspiring and had character. Working on the road can suck the life out of you -- especially in a cookie-cutter hotel. Erin's loft was unique and beautiful and the inside was large and had amazing wooden floors and a personality to it. I enjoy shooting photography as one of my favorite hobbies and the interior and surrounding area nearby were so interesting to photograph. Full transparency...this area is not bustling with nightlife or a pristine, new development. It has a little bit of grit to it but in a way that I appreciated. Erin was friendly and I had a smooth stay. Highly recommend!"

Some FYIs, there is street noise. The building hallways are going through construction/renovations. The photos of the loft don’t match - different furniture and kitchen does not have a stove like the photo shows. There is a micro, toaster oven, and single hot plate. We didn’t need to use the kitchen so wasn’t a big deal for us but would imagine it’d be hard to make a hot meal. Otherwise, for our purposes, met our needs."

With plenty of comfy places to lounge and sleep, the beautiful hardwood floors and sweepingly high ceilings, the apartment feels palatial and is filled with simple pleasures-- beautiful art, a wall of wonderfully curated books, and a delicious selection of LPs with a simple record player.
What's more, you are only a 15 min walk to the wonderful park, filled with trails and beautiful sites, and the main street in Youngstown. Would have been happy to have spent a few more days just living in the room. Excited to go back next year and looking forward to seeing the wonderful work Erin is completing.
ALSO! Erin is rad. Super helpful and friendly. Would love to go back and pick her brain about the area."

Everything was clean, the furniture was fun, the bed was comfy, the shower was great. We loved playing records on her record player. We got delicious takeout from a great Caribbean restaurant that Erin recommended called Dalia's. It's best to call to order - they came just after seven, when the cafe closed and that was perfect timing for us.
Erin was super communicative and helpful - when we accidentally left our dog food and pills behind, she was quick to offer to send them to us. She went above and beyond.
I highly recommend this space."

Stayed with a pet","Easily one of the coolest, unique and comfortable lofts I’ve stayed in. We found Erin’s spot while moving across the country with our 3 cats, all of whom loved to explore the huge space.
Beautifully curated, charming, unpretentious, and fascinating building with an interesting history worth looking into and worth appreciating. After reading a bit about it, Erin seems to be doing something really important and admire the effort she’s put into the space and her project at large. I’d much rather give Erin my money to support this place than some average AirBnB slumlord.
No TV is a non-issue, so I don’t particularly understand the gripe with that — in my opinion, the space is much more oriented towards congregating, talking, listening to music, reading, and so on. If you want to watch something, use a laptop or something. Any street noise was negligible — I’ve stayed in residential neighborhoods that were louder.
In all, Erin was great, responsive (got a bit turned around with getting in the building, but Erin clarified in like less than 2 minutes), parking was convenient and safe. Had a great coffee and lunch on our way out. We liked Youngstown. We’d come back. 10/10"

We chose this room as a last minute stay for me, my husband, and our dogs for a local concert. It worked perfectly for us, but it was definitely a little pricey for the area we were in.
If we ever attend a concert in the area again, we would probably stay again simply thanks to the communication and accomodations from host Erin. Thank you so much!"

You definitely need to get downtown to find anything to do (since this is located in a more industrial-use area). Easy to get in and out of the room. Definitely neat since it is located in an old school. We saw a concert downtown and this was pretty much a 15 minute walk to the venue, which was great."

Stayed a few nights","I’m a Youngstown native and had a couple of friends in from Cleveland to introduce them to the city. The location of Erin’s place was perfect as it is walking distance to all of the main attractions like the Butler, the Museum of Labor and Industry, etc. It’s also directly across the street from Youngstown’s first protected bike lane that leads to Mill Creek Park, Youngstown’s crown jewel. The space itself was spacious, clean, climate controlled, and had plenty of charm due to it’s adaptive reuse. Would absolutely stay again."

The building is truly unique, and the lofts are impeccably designed- every corner, every detail- so beautiful, so calming. Erin is an amazing host- she was readily available, and super accommodating (we had some wishy washy dates due to work and Covid.)
Erin’s place is wonderful. Period.
Either as a stop along the way, or THE place to stop, and stay, and take a breather- you can’t go wrong here."

In the end, I found Boxcar Lounge within walking distance (I think downtown is only a bit further), and had a great evening. If you're so inclined, walk over and visit Mike, Peggy, and Kim for a drink and a delicious burger. Super nice folks, with a good collection of bourbon and gin."

Was not allowed to use the room the second night and so was charged over $400 for one night in the end and had no place to stay for the bands I booked in town. Reflects badly on me as concert promoter. Absolute Karen of a host. Hair cut and all. Nice facility but there are far better hosts."

When we first entered fairly late at night, the gas fireplace and heaters were going and the room was lit with a warm glow… it was dreamy! In the morning, the tall windows brought in so much light to fill the tall, main room. Wonderfully curated space and well kept. Thanks Erin!
Please keep in mind that this AirBnb is located in a building that is essentially a community center. The gym was in use both nights we were there… it seems like there’s typically other activity going on in other parts of the building."

If you have kids and looking for readily available TV..maybe not the place for you..there was a small TV but not plugged in/ hooked up. Plant life is strewn throughout the yoga studio which I found reminded me of home. Nice blackout curtains provide a dark sleeping environment. Overall I would rate this a 4 out 5 stars.

Many books lined the shelves in the extra bedroom i wish i had time to read the ones that intrigued me. The kitchen was stocked with tea and coffee, which I appreciated very much. I didnt sleep in the side room but the bed and the couch and chairs were quite comfy! There were mutiple heaters to keep the place warm!
The wood floors are gorgeous and the lighting is spectacular if youre into photography! You can hear the sounds of the cars outside but it was so peaceful inside that i didnt even notice them!

The unit is in a charming old school building converted into a multi-use building including a theater. The missing star is just because I was surprised a couple of the nights there was an ongoing play which made the hall outside of the unit crowded and noisy. But even this didn't spoil an overall positive experience"

She offered the option of the old school loft for more quiet and made it easy to switch my reservation. It is a lovely, HUGE space. I liked the high ceilings, preserved wooden floors, blackout curtains and remote controlled temperature control. I loved that the space is in a renovated school house that also houses a theater and gymnasium. Great communication and easy check-in/check-out. Would definitely stay here again!"

It's a bit rough around the edges and a bit loud (in-home care service next door sends vans in and out all night), but as a base of operations for Youngstown visitors with a taste for the urban art/yoga space lifestyle, it definitely has its charms."

This was a great location for us while we were in town for a conference, it’s close to anything in Youngstown/Boardman area. If you come to town, book this home!"

Stayed a few nights","Rachel's house was the perfect space for our group. Arrival and departure information was easily accessible and very easy to do, and the welcome basket with snacks and juices and water in the fridge were very much appreciated after a long day of travel.
The house was clean, and stayed very cool despite a hot summer weekend. We found the beds in the rooms we used to be very comfortable! While we did not use the second bathroom in the basement, the bathroom on the upper level was spacious. The water pressure isn't very strong, but it did get nice and warm. We felt very safe in the house and appreciated the smartlock for ease of access for multiple adults.
The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful, but I would note for anyone unfamiliar with this area that it can be hard to get an Uber at times, so you'd definitely want a car if you plan to explore! Rachel's guidebook offered a lot of great suggestions of things to see and do in the area. There was a lot of room to park multiple cars."

It was charming, well maintained, beautifully decorated, and had everything that we needed to enjoy our stay. We ended up cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the kitchen. The Mill Creek Wick Recreation Park entertained our kids for hours with a splash pad, playground, and sand area. The Oh WOW! Center for Science and Technology was a great way to spend a morning.

Comfortable beds and furniture. The house was super clean and obviously well cared for and attended to. The host was available via text for a few minor questions, with immediate responses. The neighborhood was quiet and walkable - we even walked to the supermarket a half mile away for a forgotten item through the pleasant neighborhood. Bedding and towels were good quality. The kitchen was very well prepared for a family gathering with homemade meals. The Craftsman style home feels warm and personal (speaking as someone who lives in a Craftsman home). It has a very ""homey"" appeal. My sister probably said it best, remarking ""this just sort of feels like we are 'at home.' "" I will absolutely try to plan another family visit here again. My thanks and gratitude to our hosts."

Stayed with kids","This was our second stay with Rachel. It is perfect for our extended family gathering. The home has everything we need, even spare diapers and baby shampoo for the grandbabies, and plenty of space. It is centrally located for our visit with the great grandmother's. Rachel was quick to respond to any questions. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. We enjoyed our stay and will be back."

We really liked how she strategically placed picture frames around the house that informed us of where things were that we might need, as well as directions on what to do before leaving. It was roomy, quiet and had comfy beds and pillows!"

She and her husband are excellent communicators and were quick to help when we couldn't figure out the AC that first night. Rich even offered to pick us up a few things from the store since that's where he was when we called. Rich also suggested a museum our toddler loved. Visiting the Amish Market was his idea, and we were NOT disappointed.
The neighborhood felt safe and the neighbors were friendly. The house is beautiful and well furnished. The kitchen has plenty of gadgets and dishes, and Rachel had plenty of snacks around and bottled water in the fridge. There's lots of natural light and the claw foot tub is beautiful.
It is worth noting that the bathroom is on the second floor in case you've got mobility issues or find it difficult to do stairs.
Book at Rachel's place, enjoy some coffee on the porch, and have a blast in Youngstown!"

There was also a variety of shampoos and conditioners although we didn’t need them. That was a step above other places. The kitchen was minimal and not a place for cooking but we only needed the fridge so it was perfect for us. The bed was comfortable but there was little room for hanging clothes. We would have preferred a tub over the shower stall. The apartment was facing a commercial area and we were a little concerned about that but the road quieted down at night. We enjoyed our stay.

Close to the metro parks, and I visited the Fellows Riverside Gardens part of the Mill Creek metropark system, by Glacier Lakes, and saw a birds eye view of downtown Youngstown while driving down there and also from the park. Plenty of parking, comfy bed, and very clean."

Stayed a few nights","Irina's place is absolutely wonderful! I would say the cleanest, the cosiest, absolutely the most comfortable and beautiful AirBnB place I have stayed at. I liked it so much that I did not even want to go back home! The sheets are so clean, the mattress is so comfortable, no noise at night, and I am pretty sensitive to noise - I slept like a baby! The internet super stable, everything one needs - coffee, tea, shampoo, soap, etc. - is right there within arm's reach.
I really enjoyed my stay at Irina's place and I will certainly will be coming back again!"

Stayed one night","Great place, clean it has all you need and the host communicates well! I don’t see any issues if you may need something Irina will get back to you quickly. The only thing that one should know is that the bungalow faces and is right on a 4 lane major road that has a lot of traffic. It is noisy. It may be an issue for you or it may not be. The time we stayed there were lots of sirens and road noise over night. I had a hard time sleeping but than again I’m not used to noise at night. Other than that you can’t go wrong here bed was comfortable, heat/ac easily controlled. Has just about anything you need for a short stay. Would recommend as long as you know about the busy street and it’s on with you than you will have no issues here."

Irina, thank you so much for being so accommodating and sweet to my mother in law in a place far from her home."

The location was perfect for anyone driving on route 80 as it’s near the highway and there was plenty of free parking on the street. The room had cute English touches which is part of why I booked it since it reminded me of being back in one of my favorite countries, England!
Communication was great - everything was outlined on how to enter the property, where to park, etc. I even had the chance to chat with Kathryn for a while before I left and it was nice to get to know each other and bond over alot of similarities.
Overall, I’d recommend Kathryn’s place to anyone passing through."

Stayed about a week","Using Kathryn’s place as a base for an eight-day stay in Youngstown was a Godsend. Even though I only needed a place to bunk down at night and prep in the morning had I needed more this would have still been the right place to go. It felt more like I was actually living at home rather than visiting somewhere. The accommodations were perfect, bed was great, amenities were beyond reproach and even Kathryn’s two “greeter” pooches were perfect. The address is in a quiet, residential area but still gives a feel for Youngstown as it used to be with former industrial areas nearby, YSU and Mill Creek Park a short ride away and sources for whatever you might need within a short hop. All-in-all I think I lucked into a definite cone-back-to place."

We had some issues with towels of not being clean and Kelly promptly sent over brand new towels the same night , can't get better than that . Overall it was a pleasant experience."

Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. Thank you Kelly!"

I loved that she allows pets since we were traveling with our dogs. The house is in a nice dog friendly neighborhood where you can walk your dogs except the sidewalks are in need of repair.

Group trip","One of the most beautiful and clean airbnb's i have ever stayed at!! Absolutely gorgeous! If you are looking in the area THIS is the place to stay! All of the beds are super comfortable, even the sleeper sofa! The area is very nice and quiet. My family felt comfortable being outside even after dark. The host provides everything you need to feel at home! 1 and only thing is that if you are traveling with more people and need to use the basement pullout couch just know that the basement is SUPER noisy! The shower is directly above the sleeper sofa and everytime someone showers, uses the sink or flushes the toilet you WILL be woken up. Also the air-conditioning kicking on is like a mac truck coming through the basement. However, if you are only using the upstairs bedrooms this will not affect you AT ALL. That being said we had an amazing stay and would 100% stay again when in the area! Thank you so much for the beautiful CLEAN home!!"

We enjoyed morning and evening walks with our dog around the neighborhood. A word of caution, the neighborhood sidewalks are very, very uneven so best to walk on the street if possible. It's also a short walk to Mill Creek Park.
The home had mostly everything we needed. What wasn't there, we made due.
We had a relaxing stay and would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home."

Stayed a few nights","I booked the “Pink Door” for my friend’s wedding in Youngstown. I was happy to find a place that was so conveniently located. It was perfect because my friends were getting married at the Fellowship Riverside Gardens and the house pretty much borders multiple entrances to the park. It’s an older house, but you can tell a lot of thought went into the renovations of the space. It is very clean and modern while still staying true to the traditional neighborhood that it is located in. The beds were very comfortable and the shower had great pressure. It was very nice to be able to sit on the back porch, drink my coffee, and enjoy the birds and wildlife that live around the area. I will definitely be booking Jody’s “Pink Door” house whenever I have another event in Youngstown."

The amenities were outstanding, and you truly feel like you are staying in a home away from home. We were so pleased with the decor and the little touches that Jody, our host, brought to every corner of the home.
The location of The Pink Door could not be better. It is within walking distance of Lanterman's Mill in Mill Creek Park, which is a must-see for nature lovers. We also found that we were walking distance to an amazing local co-op called Common Goods Studio, which showcases local vegan food, clothing, candles, and crafts. We enjoyed a Mamalagels Sriracha Everything bagel and coffee, both of which were amazing.
Jody was there for us our entire stay and made our arrival and departure a breeze. There is no doubt in my mind that I will be staying at The Pink Door at Newport Lake again."

Stayed one night","Kathryn enjoys hosting as is evident by her efforts to make the apt cozy and to communicate with guests, even left a personal message. I needed a quiet place to complete a digital project, which I did. The place is older, perhaps built in the 30s or 40s but very clean. Neighborhood, quiet, water pressure, strong and water, hot. I recommend her place but I would feel better mentioning some things as full disclosure. Refrigerator is a hotel size, not apartment size. Don't plan to buy many groceries that would require refrigeration. The windows in the bedroom and bathroom opened which I liked. Night was quiet. I was a bit surprised that two of the apartment windows, original to the house, were pulled-to with string but didn't close all the way. There was a gap of about 2-3 inches and stuffed with insulation. It looked as if they had been this way for a while. This is not something I expected to see. I appreciate the clean accommodations and Kathryn's kind communication."

The place was extremely cozy, conveniently located, and had everything we needed. We got some snow overnight which made the quaint area even more beautiful. We were only here for a quick stay, but what stood out and made our stay so special was how hospitable Kathryn and her husband were! She went out of her way to recommend local places nearby, offered to help us start up the fire pit outside, and even cleared the snow off our car the next morning. Now THAT is a SUPER HOST! Thank you Kathryn for making our stay so special. We will be back soon ☺️🫶🏼

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Kathryn’s was great! I absolutely loved the added touch of a coffee bar. Utensils/ dishes / appliances were available as well as some spices and seasonings. Cozy and functional living space. Attention to minor accommodations that make a big difference (board games, coloring, plush blankets). Some spaces were a bit tighter than expected and there were stairs leading up to our space- this was fine for our family but may not be ideal for others with mobility restrictions. My biggest criticism would be that there was a decent bit of dust (blinds, ceiling fans, some less used surfaces) although the space was tidy and clean otherwise. Grocery and general stores within short driving distance. Great local nature trails and waterfalls!"

Perfect for one or two people. Comfortable bed, hot shower with good water pressure. I was there in summer and there was good AC. Very quiet neighborhood, the only thing I heard were birds outside.
Great communication, very clear instructions (via the app and also in written form inside the unit). Kathryn has made it feel very homey and she provides many amenities to make your stay comfortable. I was ready to move in for good!"

Stayed one night","Great place! I would strongly recommend. The hostess is very responsive and was able to accommodate me on a last minute stay while I was traveling. Checkin process was very smooth with a lockbox. The apartment itself is very comfy and cozy, in a very nice neighborhood. I had a very comfortable sleep as well. I would strongly recommend. You won't get better value than this."

Stayed one night","The place is cosy and clean, but a bit small for three. As we were staying only 1 night, it was perfectly ok. A lot of kitchen accesoires, coffee etc. Very detailed description for check-in. But be punctual with check-out, as even 15 min delay can cause extra charges."

Stayed one night","My fiancé and I stayed overnight on our drive from NYC to Wisconsin. Kathryn’s place was so adorable and had everything that we needed! There was a full stove and mini fridge (we didn’t use but was nice to have for those planning a longer stay)! The bed was super comfortable and felt like a cabin oasis. Easy parking on the street and just a few minutes away from downtown Youngstown where we had a bite to eat and a coffee on our way out in the morning! Definitely would recommend, great place for the value."

Stayed one night","Quaint, cozy upstairs apartment. Plenty of coffee and tea supplies. Good streaming TV options. We stayed just one night and we were comfortable. The steps are rather steep if you have mobility issues."

Stayed a few nights","I’m originally from Youngstown Ohio. So when I return I’m visiting family and old friends. Kathryn’s cabin-like apartment Is one of the most calm, peaceful spaces I’ve ever found myself in. Additionally, I travel all over the world and stay in Airbnb’s. I have to say I think this is one of the coziest , warm, welcoming places I’ve ever stayed in my life. The Decor is so perfect. I’m not sure if Kathryn studies feng shui but her space is not only cozy but nurturing. I cannot believe this space exists in Youngstown, Ohio. I was so sad that I had to leave. I will definitely be booking in the future, when I return to visit Youngstown!"

Stayed with kids",Nice little cabin feel. Other rgan the birds it was a nice stay. They tell us about the stairs but didn't show pictures of them. They are steep so make sure you can handle stairs well before you book. I should have double checked that part as my mother is handicapped.
