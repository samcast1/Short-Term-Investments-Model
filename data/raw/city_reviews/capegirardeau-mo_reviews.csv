Stayed with kids","This is a beautiful home with so much original character. We had family/friends come over to enjoy a meal with and they commented on how beautiful the house was. Our kids as well as ourselves felt right at home. Was kinda sad we only got to enjoy the house for one night. If you are visiting Cape, this is definitely one you should stay at."

Cape G is such a cute, quaint town and this house is ideally situated and everything we wanted to do was walkable. The kitchen has everything you could need. The bathrooms were so nice and very clean. The beds were super comfy with nice, quality linens. Stacy was very responsive and friendly. Highly recommend this home for your Cape G getaway!"

Stacy always makes sure the place is clean and has everything you need for a short stay. Do you like to sleep with a fan? Done. Need an extra blanket? She’s got you. Do you like ice with your drinks? Ice maker works very efficiently. This is the cutest cottage to stay at! Thanks again Stacy!

Stayed a few nights",Lovely pristine cottage with plenty of space to spread out and for my teen daughter to have some privacy. Daughter has autism and mobility issues and it was easy to get inside the house with her wheelchair. The beds were comfortable and we had all the amenities we needed. Loved that it was walking distance to so many places including the river front. Next time we will have to come earlier in the week when more places are open but our main objective was to find a halfway point between Alabama and Kansas City where I could meet my sister and have a nice visit. This was the perfect spot and Stacy was an extremely helpful and gracious hostess!

Group trip","The location of the house was great. Within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and shops. Cute little coffee house right around the corner. We were too late in the year for the farmers market in the back yard but they had a fundraiser there Saturday night with a band so a definite bonus. They were shut down early though since it was a residential area. The house was great. The beds were comfy. The layout of rooms upstairs is a bit odd but that's due to it being an older home I assume. Stairs were a bit steep but again not anyone's fault just something to mention. We had a blast and would stay here again!!"

Very spacious, updated and comfortable. We so much appreciated the sitting room with toys for the little one - not something most rentals offer! We loved the location - the house is so convenient to the Cape historic district and was great for walking to the Mississippi River to watch the barges, the farmers market, and proximity to local restaurants. Stacy was a great host, very pleasant and responsive in all communications. If we have a need to have an extended Cape again I would most definitely select this home!"

Group trip",The house was wonderful and was really perfect for my family's stay while visiting for Christmas. The downstairs open area was very big and comfortable for them to hang out and make meals. The location is fun as it was easy to walk around to go shopping and go out to eat. Stacy was very easy to work with and they even sent someone right away to shovel the show in the walkways. Also a perk is there are no steps to get in to the front door so it was easy to get my family member in a wheelchair in and out of the house.

The house had everything we needed and the kitchen was well stocked. Ryan took some of his time to give us a great tour and overview of the history of the property and how they transformed the house from its neglected past to its beautiful current state. We had to stay in Cape longer than expected and Ryan and Stacy worked with us and allowed us to stay the extra days that we needed. Much appreciated!

I can go on! If you’re there on a Saturday, make sure you step out the back door for farmers market… truly a highlight of our trip. Don’t get me started about those freshly made donuts!

We did not want to stay in a hotel and wanted all of us under the same roof. We all were amazed by this beautiful historic home. There is adequate parking and a nice seating area in the back. The inside of the home is amazing and it felt like home. We were all able to sit down at the same table or at the enormous kitchen island for a meal or just to catch up. The hosts Stacy and Ryan were very attentive and messaged us from time to time to see if we needed anything. Please do not hesitate to check it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed.

Group trip","We spent Christmas at the cottage to be near family living in Cape Girardeau and Sikeston. The cottage is beautifully decorated and is very spacious. The kitchen, dining and living room area is all very open making it perfect for a small family gathering. The home is extremely clean, has super comfortable beds and is stocked with everything you could possibly need. The hosts were very helpful in providing all the details we needed to know about the house and providing nearby restaurant recommendations. The cottage is close to everything in downtown Cape. So much better than staying in a hotel. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the area."

I did message Stacy about it to let her know for future guests. We didn’t utilize the upstairs,however we did go up there to take a look. It’s very nice and the rooms are divided off with the bathroom being placed in the middle conveniently. Plenty of room for a family with children. Check in and Check out was very simple. Parking is also simple,either out front or I believe 3-4 spots can be accommodated outback (depending on the size vehicle)."

The home is very spacious with tall ceilings and two different “living” rooms- our kids liked to play in the one upstairs while the adults were downstairs. The home is extremely clean with very comfortable furniture and beds and lots of sitting space to eat at the huge island and dining room table.

All of the buzzwords/phrases I believe a significant number of travelers look for related to a place are relevant: charming, sparkling clean, tasteful decor, comfortable, responsive and courteous host, nearby attractions....the list goes on. When you combine the actual space itself with the courteous nature and quick response time by Stacy, it is simply a great experience.
There are SO many things nearby, such as restaurants, bars, live music venues, etc., it is incredibly easy to find something to do, should you choose to venture out of the comfortable and charming cottage. With that being said, I never experienced noise or anything from these venues that deterred from my stay. If you are in or traveling to the Cape Girardeau area and need accommodations, this is certainly something you should consider as a great experience and a great value for that experience."

Stayed one night","Amazing Hosts! I was in search of a ""no notice"" place for my husband and daughter to stay overnight due to a softball tournament schedule and there being no hotel rooms available. I turned to Airbnb on Friday morning for a place to stay Saturday night. Stacy responded immediately to my initial request and answered what likely seemed to be my never-ending questions to make sure my husband and daughter would be ""all set"". Her hospitality was top notch! My only regret was that their schedule didn't allow them to enjoy everything the Cottage at the Market has to offer, along with the surrounding area. We were so pleased that my husband immediately requested that I try and book it again for the next tournament! Rest assured, Ryan and Stacy will go the extra mile to make sure you and your family are ""all set"" when visiting Cape!!"

All furnishings were higher end and the place was decorated very welll. Even the utnesils and pots/pans were like new. We chose the air bnb route rather than a hotel for our boys soccer tournament and it actually costed me $150 less for the weekend than what the Drury Conference Hotel would have costed us. It was also nice that the business below was not open on the weekend so parking wasnt a problem. We would definitely stay here again in the future.

Stayed a few nights","We loved this place. The view of Cape Girardeau’s murals and the passing trains was great. (The bedrooms were far enough away that we weren’t bothered by train noise at all.)
Everything was clean and new. The beds were comfortable. The river and shops were in easy walking distance.
We took a day trip to the iron min and space museum at Bonne Terre.
Lindsey responded quickly to anything we asked, allowed us to check in a little early and even returned an item we left to our daughter who lives in Cape! This is above and beyond! We will definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Abbie was communicative and kind. Her father was also a part of the conversations, and he was equally agreeable. Abbie provided copious info on how to enter the house and provided a ton of details on what to expect. The space was exactly as she described it and there was zero confusion about amenities or the best ways to utilize the space. I appreciate this level of clarity.
Side note: I used the iron and realized it was a bit damaged. Upon messaging Abbie that I might need another, she and her father offered to send a brand new one over almost immediately. They displayed a high level of service and attention to detail."

If I could even “complain” about anything it would be to just be careful of the hot water! It gets nuclear hot without a lot of warning, so anyone with a touch sensory issue should be cautious. Otherwise, we would absolutely book with her again if we take another trip there! It was also a very quiet stay which was very lovely."

Stayed a few nights","The place was cute and looks as described. These were the issues that we had with the place.
I do not like the fact that we were only given two rolls of TP for a fam of four for five days. I also don't like the fact that all the coffee pods were expired as of 2001.
There was a horrible rodent like smell throughout the place that drove us nuts. I also would have loved some hangers to hang our clothes.
My husband and I couldn't even whisper without our kids hearing us in the other bedroom because the rooms are connected and only divided by a sliding closet door. If you want privacy it won't happen in these rooms.

That is all!"

Nice quiet neighborhood. Love the history wall! We didn’t get a chance to use the bikes, but such a great idea!
Chest of fun activities for kids/family! Nice big dining room table. Open concept for family conversing while cooking. Lots provided for cooking own meals, or enjoy the plethora of restaurants/coffee shops C.G. offers!
Adore the bathroom and vintage fixtures! Showerhead was great!
Keurig was a bonus! Driveway needs attention, with 2 deep potholes. Easier to park at bottom, across the street.
Easy coming and going with security code! Loved having accessibility to TV/Netflix/etc!"

Group trip","I rented this for pictures, and it was amazing, and super cute. we also did a girls night after. There were a few minor things. like the super hot water that is labeled on the kitchen sink wasn't remotely hot. The internet didn't work while we were there. You couldn't even find the name of it in the ones Alexa kept telling us something was wrong. which meant I couldn't work on photos. The quiet time by 10pm on a weekend I think is
pretty strict. You can also hear everything the person downstairs is doing. I Had to listen to their music and TV most of the day so did my guests.
the beds were comfy the couch was amazing. it was clean. all in all I would rent again and hope the neighbors weren't home. the air and heat work amazing!"

Seemed like a great place!

Stayed a few nights","This was a lovely stay! The amenities and instructions from Abbie were very helpful! I appreciated all of the towels, water bottles, and thoughtful supplies (like the cotton pads and q tips in the bathroom) provided. I actually expected fewer towels to be provided, but there were plenty!
The decor was very cute, and the history wall was a beautiful touch to this charming rental.
Also, the bed in the white room was super comfortable! I totally overslept because of how well I rested there. They're also pretty low to the floor, so it made it very accessible.
A couple words of warning, there is a steep driveway, so keep that in mind if you park in the spot right by the door, or park on the street closest to the unit (not across the street).
Also, this unit is hard to leave behind. It's so comfortable and nice that you'll want to stay FOREVER. Proceed with caution."

The only big negative for me is the driveway. Also, you might want to bring ice. They have a very creative refrigerator (you’ll see—it’s fun) but it doesn’t make ice if you’re used to that (which we aren’t!).
The price is great for this place and you will likely enjoy your stay!"

the unit we were struck by a horrible odor. As we were exploring the space, we discovered a wide open window. Later, we were unfortunate to find poop on the toilet seat, and as we turned in we found stains on the bedding in both rooms. But we needed to crash and I am thankful we had a safe place to do so. I'm hopeful the owner can follow up with whoever does the cleaning based on this feedback."

The down sides were the drive is very very step so it is pretty much a necessity to park on the street. The street isn’t very busy and the neighborhood safe so parking on the street wasn't a problem. There was a little traffic noise and noise from the other tenants but it wasn’t too bad. I would stay again because the location is so close to downtown. Also the bike tires are souped flat!

I felt fine waking the area. If you don’t know - you go to Broussards and minglewood. And port cape. The deck on top with river view is so fabulous. It’s so quiet in this place. Also a tv in every room is always a plus. The windows are new and everywhere so tons of light if you want. Bedrooms can become plenty dark. 1 1/2 baths that are clean and new. Love the lock to building and then the unit!"

In the three days and nights we spent there, my sister and I spent hours on the balcony in deep conversation over wine, prepared a gourmet dinner for a friend (the kitchen is well-equipped), and embarked on a two-hour walk around downtown. Andrew was a responsive but not intrusive host. It's hard to imagine how our stay could have been better."

The penthouse was exactly as advertised and the view from the private deck was to die for! It’s a quick 5 minute walk to the historic downtown and we’ll worth the steps and the burn from climbing the hill on the way back.
I love that they have a special heart for traveling nurses and offer 90 day lease rentals. Honestly they were fantastic hosts and their rental was beautiful. We’ll definitely be back!!!"

It seems they thought of everything from milk in the fridge for coffee, to a shelf with kids books and a few toys, to blankets to cuddle up with as we watched a good movie. It was simply icing on the cake to get to meet and talk with Gail. She is so delightful! We also loved the home, the neighborhood, and that is so close to everything from the Mississippi River and murals, to old town and restaurants to SEMO (Southeast Missouri University) which was only one block away. We really fell in love with Cape Girardeau and Frank and Gail were a big part of helping us feel like we were home. We came so that I could walk the stage as I received my masters at age 58! It was so enjoyable to have two of my children with me since my husband is overseas for a while."

When we went into the Airbnb for the first I was so delighted with how well the space was used. Everything was clean and the attention to detail and the decor throughout was incredible!
There was a beautiful park behind the house and was the perfect spot for Eclipse viewing. Also, for those needing a place to stay for a SEMO visit… this is it! You could truly walk there from the house.
The house was just a short drive from Downtown Cape filled with restaurants and shops.
Even though it was a very short visit, it was perfect and had what we needed.

Stayed with kids","This Airbnb was perfect! It looks exactly like the photos and has so many amenities. It’s clean, has a washer/dryer, is stocked with snacks/coffee etc. The beds and pillows are comfortable and cozy. There’s a nice TV room where you can relax, play board games, or read a book to unwind. The neighborhood is safe and walkable, with many restaurants and things to do nearby. The decor is super cute and makes you feel right at home. During our stay the temperature dropped well below the freezing mark. Our host was proactive and checked to make sure we had everything we needed. The host was friendly and responsive. Overall, I’d rate this place as perfect. I wish we could’ve extended our stay."

The nice linens, comfy beds, tissues, coffee, teas, bottled waters, local guide, and nice accommodations made for a memorable mini-vacation.

Easy to get to and Frank and Gail personally met us upon arrival. They are the sweetest, kindest and most accommodating couple. Frank even fired up the fire pit for us so we could go out back asap.
The apartment itself was wonderful. Just like the pics shown. It was so homey, neat and clean. Many amenities like towels, linen, basic kitchen needs including pots, pans, dishes, Kerig coffee maker with a variety of coffees. Pretty much you need included in the small kitchen.
I'm so happy I chose this spot for my first experience because the 4 of us had an absolutely fabulous time. Frank and Gail are definitely top Host/Hostess.
If I could give 10 stars, I would certainly do so. Hoping my group can get together again soon and this will be available when needed!!"

Stayed with kids","We liked it so much, we had to stay another day!
Wonderful area-- clean, quaint, and very friendly. The location and house set-up suited our needs to a tee.
A separate bedroom for my two teenager daughters, and the TV/sitting room they claimed as their own, too. The kitchen had everything we needed to do 2/3 of our dining ""at home"", ensuring we ate healthily and saving us money-- that made it SO worth it, in my opinion.
We toured campus (loved it!), enjoyed a jazz orchestra concert, went to the farmers' market, found pastries and ice cream, toured the US Army Corps of Engineers flagship barge, and found lots of affordable options for back-to-school shopping.
Frank and Gail were so personable, and, even though they were traveling elsewhere while we were there, they were very easy to communicate with and they still 'took care of us' from afar. Looking forward to coming down again later this year and finally meeting these wonderful hosts! The place is perfect."

Frank and Gail are super hosts. Upon arrival in an absolute downpour of rain they came over to meet us to say hello. And quickly assist to shuffle our gear from car to home.
Frank and Gail have created an absolute peaceful and perfect spot in Cape G. The house was very clean. My wife and I felt right at home from the minute we ascended the stairs. Everything was in order. And as others have noted Frank and Gail have provided all the basic amenities and more. The home is well appointed with classic decorative touches. I felt as if I were back at home in New England living in a classic cape style apartment. The old wood floors, classic windows, and style. Just perfect for a night it more to split a long drive and explore Cape G.
We highly recommend spending one or more days at this lovely home. You won’t be disappointed. And surely you’ll be hard pressed to find better hosts!"

It may have been a total fluke, but unfortunately it was extremely loud at night, due to a helicopter that circled over every few minutes until 2:30 am.i don't know if that's unusual. we heard neighbors fighting in the middle of the night. we didn't get much sleep. the ""quiet"" didn't pan out for us, which is the #1 concern for me when seeking a lodging. if that sort of thing doesn't bother you, this place is absolutely a five star!"

The property was very quiet and provided me with everything needed for a successful stay. Gail was very friendly and quick to answer any questions I had. I highly recommend staying at this cute, quaint and quiet Airbnb if you are ever in the area. I will be back!!"

Capaha park & SEMO are both in easy walking distance. This is a private apartment in a large home that is separated into 2 or more different units. The other units were occupied but it was very quiet, much less noise than the hotel I stayed at the night before. I wouldn't have know anyone else was there if it weren't for the other cars in the parking area behind the home. The owners live next door & were very responsive to messages, though I really didn't need anything. Lots of nice touches, coffee, water & snacks. Clear & prompt communication. Just a great place to stay. Looking forward to staying here again."

The rooms are spacious and cozy, with super comfortable beds, the kitchen is well equipped, plus, there is a cozy sitting area and a marvelous porch with a really nice swing.

Everything worked fine. We used the hot tub. Quiet neighbor hood. Casino right down the road. I would rent again. Owner was in communication and available if we needed anything."

Stayed one night","Andrew's place was a nice quiet getaway. It has been the best place we've stayed out of our visits, nothing wrong with the others. The location was close to other houses but felt like we were away from everything. Andrew has plenty to do in the house it was hard to leave to get out & enjoy the town. We made great use of the pool table dart board & hot tub, as well as enjoyed the back deck & front porch. We are hoping to stay there again soon. Also, special memories were made here during our visit. Thanks again Andrew for providing a great log cabin for people to stay in while visiting Cape Girardeau, MO."

we have a lot of favorites, but our highlight was definitely the hot tub, while the pool table was an added bonus of our night!
the deck was absolutely the perfect backdrop for our morning cup of coffee.
the only regret is that we did not stay longer! 10 out of 10!"

Stayed about a week","Almost everything about this place is fantastic. They were very communicative and made sure everything was okay throughout our stay. The area around the house was pretty nice. The backyard is generally pretty private, and was super cute. The hot tub is an awesome bonus, plus a firepit, grill and pool table! The Cape Girardeau area is definitely a place for people who love the outdoors. They do have pamphlets for you to look through and find things to do tho. I only have 3 complaints, the main one being the lack of storage. I stayed there for a week, so I brought a lot, but if you're going for a weekend or something like that, the storage would be fine! My 2nd complaint is mostly a me thing because I'm a bit of a germophobe, but there are a couple of areas where it seemed time for a super deep cleaning, so that worried me a little bit. Also the bed was alright, the pillows were very uncomfortable. But overall, it's a very cute and fun place, and I absolutely would stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","The pictures are a little deceiving. I was expecting a cabin with more privacy and more seclusion. The cabin is more of a studio with a separated part for the bedroom. The back door only has one lock and no dead bolt. The street leading up isn’t well lit. The house was hard to find and the street is narrow. We did arrive at night time, so of course that made it harder. There is no privacy fence, so the hot tub just sits in the back yard just off the deck. Honestly, I didn’t feel very safe. I wish there were more locks on the doors and an actual privacy fence that went all the way around the back yard instead of just the sides. The side was pretty cool. The pool table and dart board were fun, and the bed was clean and comfortable. The bathtub was a little dirty along with the floors. Overall, the experience was just ok. I guess just based on the photos I had higher expectations."

This place is so cool. It’s small, but it packs a lot. We stayed for two nights. Everything was clean, instructions and communication was great, and all the amenities were a real treat. It just felt like home away from home, which was especially nice considering all the logistics and complications we had for traveling for a wedding. I definitely recommend staying here!"

As with many older homes, the outside walls are thick which makes it extremely quiet and peaceful on the inside. The living room is huge with several sitting areas in which to relax. Love a separate dining room with large table! The king bed was plush and each bedroom upstairs has unique features. Bathrooms were updated and very clean. Kitchen had everything one would need. We enjoyed the sunroom with large TV. Great place to sit outside under the arbor and backyard was fenced for privacy. An assisted care living place was across the road so it seemed a very safe environment and again, extremely quiet and peaceful. The house had a great feel about it. Felt like going home to grandma’s house where you can kick back and simply enjoy your time in the home. Thanks George & Denise!"

The kitchen had everything we needed for family meals, and the other rooms were perfect for playing games, watching TV, and enjoying one another. The yard is very large and the kids were able to play baseball, ride their scooters and run free. The beds were comfortable and linens great. Beyond that, George freshly cut the grass for us and Denise provided great amenities and treats for us for the eclipse, she even had viewing glasses for us! One of the best Airbnb experiences we have had and would highly recommend their home! Our kids and grandkids will remember that stay forever."

My parents were both so pleased with the home and all of the amenities provided. My mother couldn't get over how Denise has thought of everything. Denise even called my mother after I had given her her number to let her know that she had unlocked the basement door for them because there was a bad storm one evening and she wanted them to have a place to go just in case. My parents keep talking about how they can't wait to go back and will recommend Denise's home to anyone visiting the area!"

The perfect spot to relax 🧖‍♀️🧖‍♂️during the late evening 🌙hours after the fun day out on the town, just a block or two away. 🛌Cozy bed, massage chair 💆‍♀️💆‍♀️, TV, 📺 Roku, Keurig COFFEE ☕️, and kitchen table w/ chairs 🍽 are just a couple of the highlights.

Stayed about a week","This stay was amazing.
Daniel is super responsive and checked in with me a few times without being too pushy.
I ran into a car problem that didn’t allow me to meet the money needs for my full stay, but Daniel worked out a deal with me on a few extra nights to get things figured out.
He answered all my text and any questions I have.
The washer and dryer are top notch, fast and look brand new.
When you first walk in, it’s bright and welcoming.
The massage chair is amazing, the TV with FREE* streaming services is always a plus, the couch is great and so is the pull out bed.
The bed we slept in was more than comfortable, I had my best nights sleep in a LONG time.
They’re very well spoken, respectful, and there if you need them.
I also loved the private entrance way, and the keypad lock gave me a feeling of security.
Although Daniel wasn’t around physically during my stay, he made sure I knew he was there to help and that’s awesome!
5 stars all the way!! Using again! :)"

Extremely extremely clean and comfortable mattress. I generally prefer more options in the kitchen but it was perfect for the need of boiling water and while in the water completes what I need for instant oatmeal and tea. Great Accommodations Kendall & Daniel. ✝️ with my son and his fiancée living in cave there is a strong probability that I will be returning on multiple occasions. Thank You both !

The location is close enough to everything to be convenient, but far away enough to be quiet and serene. The hosts are extremely welcoming and helpful, the place is spotlessly clean, and the amenities are very thoughtful and complete. It's a basement apartment, so it doesn't get a huge amount of light in the daytime, which you might want to factor in if you're planning to spend much time indoors there. There's also a seating area in the backyard if the weather is warm enough. We recommend this place without reservations!"
