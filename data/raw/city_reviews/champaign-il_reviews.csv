Stayed one night","I stayed for the first night of a business trip. Nidia's place was well appointed, clean, and comfortable. The shower was great with good pressure and hot water. The bed was firm and Nidia had provided a tower fan and small heater in case either was needed. I didn't use any of the provided amenities, but they were every bit as nice as a hotel. The only drawback I could see is if you wanted to spend quite a bit of downtime in the space, this might not be the place (she does have another rental tho that has room). If you just need a comfy, safe overnight base of operations, this is a great space! You can definitely tell that she cares for the comfort of her guests and I would recommend this space."

It offered good amenities, was clean, and generally quiet. The water temperature was warm, but I never experienced a hot shower. All things considered, decent accommodations for a decent price."

Stayed over a week","I don't recommend this spot for long stays- short stays probably fine. The host is very nice and generally helpful. A couple times there was a lack of communication (car parked in wrong part of driveway, sink broken) in ways that were inconvenient. Place is very clean and generally comfortable but as a basement suite was quite cold in winter aside from the space-heated bedroom. Smoke, cooking smell, and noise tend to come down from upstairs."

Stayed a few nights",It is a nice place to stay. Nidia answers my question quickly. The only problems are that there are sometimes noises from above and being careful not to hit your head when stepping down the stairs. I did that sometimes. It will be better if there are some signs to tell me to pay attention.

However, the ceiling clearance was extremely limited to both enter the basement unit and with several overhead pipes, both of which I frequently banged with my forehead. Suggest you advertise that the unit is best for those whose height is 5’10” tall or under."

Stayed a few nights","I had an excellent experience during my weekend at Nidia’s! The guest suite was clean, private, and comfortable. I really appreciated Nidia’s extensive instructions and quick communication, all of which made me feel safe and right at home!
It is a basement suite, so plan accordingly and maybe bring warmer pajamas if visiting in the fall/winter. Nidia also provided a space heater (and a fan for summer months) which worked well.
For those traveling on a research stipend like I was, this is a great option that will not only fit your budget, but give you quick access to the UIUC campus. Next time I am visiting UIUC, I’ll be staying here again!"

Price was reasonable considering it was graduation weekend, but everything is pretty outrageous at this time."

Stayed a few nights","The location is very convenient to UIUC and on street parking was easy to find. Bring earplugs: you can hear the floorboards creak with every step of the people upstairs, and every word of conversations. The light switches are wired oddly/unexpectedly, which proved a bit of a challenge in the middle of the night and after a long, tiring drive. The mattress had a significant sag/body impression and was long past its retirement age. Everything was very clean, and a coffeemaker was provided."

You do have to watch your head walking down the stairs but other than that you don’t have to duck once downstairs. The shower hot and cold is backwards so just make sure you note that when showering. It got super hot! It’s dark enough to sleep and plenty of light during the day when you open the curtain. Would recommend staying here!"

There is very easy access to the Interstates, both north-south and east-west. We like the washer and dryer in the unit, and we used the small microwave to prepare simple meals. There is a small refrigerator, and it kept our few food items fresh and convenient for us. There are only a few steps down to the basement, so it is easy access for us. We used the code Nidia sent to easily come and go. When we texted Nidia, she responded to our request right away. She always communicated with us quickly. We enjoyed our stay in Nidia's apartment very much!"

Stayed a few nights","Great location, safe neighborhood! It is a basement but you wouldn’t know it! The shower never got warm, which was the only bummer. Had to take a quick in and out cold shower:/ other than that I felt very safe staying here by myself. Wifi worked great, as well as Netflix on the TV. There is a mini fridge and microwave but no utensils so bring your own if you want to heat something up. I drive a truck so I wasn’t able to park in the driveway and had to park on the street. The neighborhood seemed safe so I was comfortable parking on the street though! I would say this is best suited for a single person or couple as it is a smaller space. It was perfect for me as I was by myself for the weekend in town for work. If you’re tall, I would be aware that there is some low ceilings and some pipes that hang pretty low. Overall It was a great stay for the price."

One word of caution would be that if you are 6' tall or above the fit might be tight, as the ceiling is very low, but aside from that this place is as cozy as you could want. Nidia is very responsive to any questions you have and the whole process was painless. When I visit Champaign again this will be the first listing I look for."

Stayed one night","The property was in a convenient location. the check in was easy and painless. The stay is in the basement of the property. The upper level of the house is occupied by residents. The ceiling of the basement is very low. It was very difficult for me to make my way around, because of my height (6'4""). The only disturbance I had was being told that I needed to move my vehicle for the occupying residents, of whom I was previously unaware. It is best suited for a single person or maybe a couple. The value is in the low price/location - safe neighborhood."

Stayed a few nights","WINTER REVIEW: this is a basement unit. Basements get cold in the winter. The bedroom stayed warm after a couple hours with a space heater on, but we had to keep the door closed. The shower never got hot. It was barely lukewarm. And there’s a vent in the shower that blows air on you when you’re wet. There is a mini fridge and microwave, but no utensils. Only mugs for coffee. Convenient location. Super responsive host."

Stayed one night","We stayed at this Airbnb for one night. Just a heads up, this is in the hosts basement so you will hear living noises above you during the day/evening. I’d assume they can hear you too if you are noisy. Make sure you bring soap/shampoo, and your own pillows if you are picky about pillows. There is a very basic sitting area with a table and folding chairs. If you want to watch tv it will be done from the bed."

Stayed one night","A cheap spot to stay if you only need a single bed for a night or two. This space is in a mostly unfinished basement that has no separation from the host's living space other than a lock on the bedroom door. I am 6' feet tall and repeatedly had to dodge hitting my head on the exposed pipes. If the host is home, you will hear every footstep and muffled conversation that takes place. The desk that is in the bedroom was very unsteady and we did not feel comfortable placing our slightly heavier bags there, in fear of the desk breaking. There is also not a curtain or blind in the bedroom space window which felt slightly odd and another contributing factor in the lack of privacy.
Overall, not a terrible spot if you're in need of a cheap place to sleep, but my girlfriend and I ended up staying with family thirty minutes outside of town due to the fact that the space is not the most inviting, private, or suited for someone who is moderately tall."

I’m 5’10, and I was OK…but I’m lucky I didn’t bring my 6’7” husband along, cause he would not have been able to stand up in there. I would stay here again."

Stayed one night","Nidia's place was close enough to downtown that we could walk. Her place was clean but know there is a 'basement smell' when you get down there (old house). Also the basement is downstairs, but the only locked door away from the rest of the house is the door to your actual room, not the entire basement space. When you walk in there is a door and stairs to the left with a clear/frosted door to the rest of the house that you can see through. Then you walk downstairs and the only door there is the one to your room. We did wish that there was a locked door to separate the entire basement area from the rest of the house. However we did enjoy the fact that we were close enough to downtown to walk and explore the area which was a big plus."

Stayed a few nights","Nidia's place is very nice and clean with all we needed to have a great stay in Champaign. We were there to visit relatives, so we didn't spend much time in the suite. When there, we were very comfortable. The bathroom was great with plenty of hot water in an excellent shower. We were happy to store a few food items in the refrigerator and were pleased the little freezer kept our frozen item frozen. The little microwave warmed our food nicely. There was a coffee maker with coffee and cups. We used the washer and dryer to do one load of clothes. Just followed Nidia's excellent directions. This was an extra we usually don't have in an AirBnB. She left us hangers on hooks in the bedroom, so we hung our clothes fresh out of the dryer. With the code Nidia gave us, we had easy entry to the basement suite. There were automatic lights on the stairs down into the basement and a sturdy handrail to hold on to. In our 70's, we had no trouble with the short flight of stairs. We were happy to park at the rear of Nidia's house leaving room for her to enter and exit the driveway. We always prefer to have our car parked off the street, so this was ideal for us! Nidia's location is excellent with all services close by. We rarely heard Nidia walking above us, and we slept very well in this quiet neighborhood. Internet service was excellent all of the time we were there. We didn't use the tv because we were there only a short time. We look forward to staying there again when we return to Champaign. Thank you, Nidia!"

The only thing we noticed is that the ceiling was not that much higher than my 6’2 husband and there’s a few pipes where most people need to duck; so tall people beware. Other than that, expect a comfortable stay at Nidia’s!"

The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. One felt immediately at home with all that was provided. It was delightful to have some basics in the fridge and on the shelves. We were easily able to enjoy a morning coffee and a simple breakfast with provisions already there. It was also nice to have an abundance of linens and bathroom products.
Donald was available on site, but not intrusive….nice to know if something went amiss. Since we’re in the area occasionally, I’m sure we’ll make a return visit.

The attention to decor and detail were impeccable.
I was rained out on looking at cicada double brood XIX and XIII that hasn’t happened since 1802! But that didn’t stop my family and I from making it a historical trip.
If you are a history buff, this is the place to go. If you are a train nerd, even better!
Don was incredibly accommodating and even showed special features within the Depot!
Pricing and amenities were wonderful - lots of goodies in the kitchen and games too! Books, many things to entertain and relax.
Don and Judy were wonderful hosts - I will be back. :)"

Stayed with kids","Super cute space, perfect for our overnight pitstop. Hosts were very friendly. Went above and beyond providing snack and breakfast options in the kitchen. It was perfect after a long day of travel. Very convenient location near the highway, but far enough away it wasn't noisy at all. A few planes went over from the airport nearby, but it wasn't a lot and it was rather fun to see them. We loved the little pond and woods to explore and enjoy. Only thing that took me by surprise was the very tight, narrow spiral staircase to get to the loft. Made me a little nervous with my youngest who gets up a few times a night sometimes to go to the bathroom, but we had a flashlight for her to use and it worked out ok. Would just be prepared to have littles sleep on the first floor with air mattresses or the like if I had a toddlers/preschoolers. Overall though, it was a great experience!"

The hosts were welcoming and gracious and had the kitchen stocked with goodies ready for a weary traveller. They provided a nice binder with literally everything you could possibly need during the stay. Very detail oriented. The home was huge and clean and so historic and charming. I will definitely try to stay here again the next time I'm in the area. The location was quiet and safe and yet not too far from amenities or the college campus, which was my reason for the visit. Overall an amazing experience. I can't recommended it enough if you're in the area! Thanks for making me feel at home!"

Everything was so well placed and accessible from towels to tissues to oatmeal and coffee to boardgames and lots of pictures to look at.
It's close enough to Champaign that we went for a pizza, but just far enough away there was no noise or traffic.
It's very cozy!

It was peaceful, the enclosed dog run was perfect for my dog, and we enjoyed walking around the lake. Champaign is only 5 min away but you feel like the house is in the middle of the country and don't see or hear it. Our only complaint is that we had to leave! Hope to stay there again :)"

In the meantime, to make sure the place was nice and warm for us, Donald had brought in three space heaters. And it was warm! He checked in to make sure we were comfortable.
The kitchen is so pleasant, with beautiful high ceilings, wood everywhere, and plenty of amenities. We spent most of our time in there, cooking and drinking tea and chatting.
This was our second time staying at the Depot, and it definitely won't be the last."

Stayed with kids","Cool place to spend a couple days for a weekend getaway. Our 2-year-old daughter enjoyed the upstairs playroom and she had fun going up and down the spiral staircase (with supervision of course). The layout is excellent and it feels plenty spacious inside for a family of 3. The carpeted loft area irritated our allergies a bit but we are probably overly sensitive on that front. The WiFi was also on the slow side, but it met our needs. I discovered Triptych Brewing nearby in Savoy and we had a wonderful time there on Saturday night after spending the day doing some light shopping in Champaign. Don is a great host and an excellent communicator — our daughter warmed up to him right away. We love the area and would happily return for another visit."

It is very roomy and comfortable. The hosts left cereal and oatmeal, along with milk, orange juice, apple juice, water, cheese, and butter, which was so convenient in the morning.
We don't have young children, but it would be so much fun to have small children here. They have built a playroom in the loft, which would be so much fun to play in if we were little.
I recommend the train depot for families traveling near Champaign."

Stayed a few nights","This was our second stay at Don's Airbnb, both times when we had come down to U. of I. to visit our son. We enjoyed our time in this unique space. The first time we stayed, Don had let us know he could stop in and tell us about the history of The Depot. He was very knowledgeable and it was interesting to hear some of the more notable facts about the place. The Depot itself was very cozy-just right for myself, my husband, and teen daughter. It's in a very quiet neighborhood about 12-15 minutes from campus. It was an easy drive for us to get to our son's apartment. We didn't use the kitchen to cook either of the times we stayed, but we did appreciate the drinks and snacks that were available. It was nice to have a larger space to enjoy the dinner we picked up and to spend time eating and catching up with our son around a table (as opposed to trying to eat dinner in a hotel room). The Depot is a fantastic place to stay and a great deal compared to hotels especially on football weekends!"

Very nice, the description was accurate. Great place for a family but if have two couples staying it would have been very awkward with the way bedrooms/bathroom is situated. Stairs to upstairs bedroom 1ft. away from main bedroom w/only bath.
There were also ""cobwebs"" coming down from the ceiling in shower stall. Husband had a spider coming down to join him in the shower!
Having said that we did have a lovely stay in this rustic, historical place. We enjoyed the fireplace in the dining room at night and the sunny kitchen table for our leisurely mornings. We found some nice places to walk in nearby Urbana."

Stayed about a week","The owners of the Depot, Judy and Don are precious. They were great hosts. There when I needed them, like family, yet gave me the space I required.
The Depot is a unique and charming B&B. It’s full of history. It’s an original train depot built in the 1850s. Don knows all the stories about Lincoln, the Civil War, and all the ghosts.
Though the Depot is in the country restaurants, shopping and the University of Illinois are just minutes away.
My favorite characteristic of the Depot are the beautiful woods, which surrounds the lake. Early sunrise walks with the color change of the fall foliage was breathtaking.
I spent several weeks at the depot. I am looking forward to my next visit early in the spring.
Thanks Don and Judy for sharing your piece of heaven with me.

It sounded amazing and had excellent reviews, but the place is better than its listing and you just can’t tell how amazing it is until you walk in. The history, the peace and privacy and the friendliest and most thoughtful host, and perhaps most of note: the comfort! The beds are fantastic, the towels are perfectly stacked and rolled and kitchen is stocked with niceties and necessities; it’s just a level of pride and attention to detail that might’ve surpassed any I’ve encountered at any Airbnb prior. We’re traveling across the country from Pennsylvania to California with a 7 year old and two dogs and each one of us was equally impressed and delighted with this stay. If we don’t make it back to Champaign again, this spot will remain in our memories of this trip forever. But we might just make it back! We loved it. Thank you Don and Judy! 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼"

Don shared the history of the train depot, which was fascinating and cool to be able to be part of. Judy was also very friendly. The accommodations were charming, the property had a lake and accessible wooded trails for a lovely walk. The property is just minutes from the University of Illinois campus and lots of restaurants and things to do. I would highly recommend staying here if you get a chance."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at the Depot for a few days between moving out of my apartment in town and moving out of state, and it was exactly what I needed. As soon as I walked inside I felt totally at home, because it’s set up as a home rather than a blank slate hotel style like a lot of airbnbs. After a long weekend of moving it was such a delight to arrive to a comfortable warm place, eat a couple pieces of chocolate left by the front door, and take a hot bath.
I’m so appreciative of being able to bring my cat and not have it be an issue. FYI to cat owners, there is a spiral staircase and loft railing that he was overly interested in and it made me nervous enough to create a barricade with my luggage to prevent him from accessing the highest points. Also FYI that the wifi wasn’t steady enough to work or stream.
It’s so obvious that a lot of love and care went into creating the space and I’m sincerely grateful for the experience. Briefly met Don who was pleasant and friendly. 10/10 would stay again!"

The towels were abundant and fluffy! Beds were comfortable with lots of indirect lighting. There were lots of board games and reading material and a fun hidden play nook with doll houses in the loft--lots of room to spread out. Parking is close to door. The courtyard (including a private patio in the back) has many seating areas to soak up some sun and watch the birds and the planes. We can't wait to come back and learn more about the history of the Depot. Thank you, Don and Judy, for being great hosts."

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful spot to get away but also close enough to town. The BnB is right outside of town and in the country, with a wonderful pond in the back with paths to walk around it. We brought our dog who loved to run around the paths, the fenced in side yard for the dog was also so convenient. The inside was so comfortable and cozy, felt like I was at my own home. We spent Christmas day here with our 5 adults kids and there was plenty of room. Beautiful dining room with fireplace was the perfect setting. Don was very responsive and could anticipate our needs, while we were staying there was a winter storm that blew thru and Don made sure we were warm with extra space heaters and shoveled the walks for us. The kitchen is completely functional and I was able to make several large family dinners there. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud and the upstairs has a nice sitting area with TV that we would watch movies at night. We will definitely return here."

The sheets on the bed were static polyester, which I am not a fan of and the pillows were flat, but the beds were comfortable and the towels were amazing.

We needed a place to stay for two nights, one with our dog and one without. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) we arrived for our appointment and found that the procedure was unnecessary at this time. So we went home. While we never did stay at Donald's place I can ASSURE you that he is a very attentive and gracious host. We exchanged many messages throughout the day and he always was kind, understanding and prompt to reply. I'm positive we will be back to Champaign and we will for sure book our stay there."

kitchen had just about everything we needed.
the upstairs loft feels like a blanket fort that is adult friendly. the stairs to get up to the loft are pretty narrow spiral staircase but we had no troubles.
hosts are super welcoming
beds are pretty comfy and everything was just gorgeous."

The region of the apartment is close to the Campus of the University of Illinois, so the time I went to the university, I went for a walk). Furthermore, the other residents and the owner welcomed us very well and quickly made us comfortable in the shared space."

The bedding was ok but nothing fancy. Extra blankets were available. The mattresses were a bit uncomfortable. Not the best quality. The towels were small and thin. The outside grill was not clean and therefore we did not use. The host was quick to respond to a question we had for which we were very grateful. The host also communicated that she was available if we had other questions or needs which was appreciated as well.

Stayed over a week","Excellent apartment; perfect location for UIUC or downtown Champaign. Bakery sounds were pleasant, even if they were a little louder on the weekend. Clean, well-appointed, easy to access private entrance, and lots of street parking. Very warm with the radiant heat! It's easy to connect to the wifi network, but it's a bit weak if you're planning a group Zoom session with video. The neighborhood is very walkable and safe, but I would note that the shared downstairs door has no lock and the apartment door for this unit felt a bit insecure: it has been modded with metal plates for the deadbolt and a chain, but it made me a bit nervous. Bed was very comfortable and the hosts were friendly and easy to communicate with!"

The kitchen was very well stocked & the bed comfy. It was also very chilly outside during our stay so the radiators were great at keeping the apartment nice and toasty. Don’t forget to grab a chocolate croissant downstairs on your way out!

It was easy to find with free street parking right out front and the neighborhood was quiet (which is much appreciated from these two city people!) The bed was comfy & hot water was readily available for showers. The space was so cute and perfect for what we were looking for. Great location too…not far from downtown Champaign, restaurants and a grocery store. Also, the bakery downstairs was so yummy and the staff were very friendly. We went every day! We are already planning on coming back next year."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay at Kaya’s place. The apartment was perfect for a solo traveler! It was very well stocked with so many helpful comforts of home, many of which I didn’t need, but nonetheless appreciated the care and attention that went into making sure the space was well appointed. For example, she had Advil, period products, toothpaste, condiments, teabags, coffee, etc. The bed and bedding were very comfy and the window AC unit did a good job cooling the place down with the help of some fans. I also appreciated that there was a dehumidifier in the unit, which helped keep things even more comfortable. I was only able to visit the bakery underneath on one morning, but it was amazing and I wish I could have gone again and snagged a cinnamon roll!! I would love to stay here again when I’m in town and high recommend the space to anyone looking for a cute and cozy Chambana crash pad."

I have a lot of food allergies and so always rent a place with a kitchen when we travel so we can cook at least some of our own meals. The kitchen had everything we needed. The mattress was very comfortable. I also appreciated the multi-type USB charger available for use. As for any noise from the bakery downstairs - we could hear movement and the occasional voice, but it didn’t wake us up and wasn’t enough to bother us. For those who may be more sensitive to any noise, there was a bowl of individually-wrapped pairs of ear plugs for guests to use. Teresa was very responsive. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and recommend it for for those traveling to the Champaign-Urbana area."

The bathroom, kitchen, and linens were very clean. more attention could have been paid by cleaning staff to cobwebs in corners and dust on baseboards and in lesser used places. the couch in the living room is not comfortable to sit on and as a result it was very hard to enjoy the living space.

The apartment is decorated so nicely and has a lot of character, and we didn’t think the bakery itself was too noisy. You can hear the customers at the tables outside the bedroom window (literally every word of each conversation), but not until 8am when they open. So it's really not a problem unless you plan on sleeping in. Everything was nice and clean, and the water pressure in the shower was great! We enjoyed a quick breakfast at the bakery, and a walk around the neighborhood too."

The bakery downstairs is cute and has great pastries - highly recommend the croissant ! However, the employees start work between 5 and 6am, and it would definitely wake you up unless you are a very heavy sleeper. The hosts do provide a white noise machine, humidifier, and other ways to dampen noise. Also, while the listing says free parking on the premises, you actually can only park on street (which is free and had space), not a huge inconvenience but was difficult in the snow. Overall, would definitely stay again though!"

Stayed a few nights","Five stars all around for this apartment. It's in a quiet residential neighborhood but a five-minute drive from downtown Champaign and like ten minutes to the University. We were grateful to be able to bring our dog and it was an excellent dog-walking neighborhood--lots of sidewalks.
What I was most impressed with about the space was how much thought had gone into small details in making it super comfortable. For example, there is a desk in the bedroom if you need to work (I did), and already plugged in and waiting for you are an assortment of cables for charging your phone at the desk. In the bathroom, there is shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a hair dryer. In the kitchen, there is a whole cabinet full of everything you need for coffee and tea -- the coffees and teas, a variety of sweeteners, nondairy creamer, etc. We felt right at home. And the bakery downstairs was superb. Try the chocolate croissants!"

The WiFi worked fine, but I wasn’t able to do anything that required a lot of bandwidth- video game consoles couldn’t connect due to poor signal strength. That was ok though, since the WiFi still works. I would highly recommend this apartment."

It seems that the host is aware of this issue and trying to manage it as best as one can. Overall, my stay here was comfortable, and I appreciated the quiet after-hours."

It seems the sound proofing wasn’t spectacular, especially near the bathroom/bedroom area. The only other issues we had while we were there was the WiFi. It liked to disconnect randomly and it happened a couple times a night.The kitchen was really nice as well and did come fully stocked with everything we needed."

Either way, it is a very convenient location to get the neighborhood feel while still having tons of access.
The apartment itself had a great vibe, was comfortable, and had everything one would need for a short or long stay. The kitchen and bathroom, which are oftentimes the bane of airbnbs were spot on in all they offered and pristine.
If you are reading this, you'll know it's over a bakery, and that bakery is pretty fantastic with wide selection of tasty goodness. This place (the apartment and the bakery) is fantastic and well worth the little extra you'll have to pay to get out of a hotel."

It looked and smelled fresh & clean and that made a great first impression. Everything was up to date. Everything worked. No issues whatsoever. Very quiet neighborhood. We were extremely pleased!"

Stayed over a week","1. The house is in a very peaceful n serene place. There is a small pond behind the house, where the chairs are placed in back verandah and one can spot ducks around.
2. The Kitchen and washrooms were well organised and lots of small eateries and toiletries placed around as promised.
3. Damon was kind enough to speak to the incoming guest and get a day adjusted for me to me get a refund.
4. The only thing, which needs to be thought of by the guest is that the bus service is limited so you need to either travel by Uber/Lyft or drive your own car."

The condo was extremely clean, and since we cooked there all week, we appreciated how well-equipped the kitchen was. The bedrooms were large and had comfortable beds. Finally, Damon was very responsive to all the questions we had both before and during our stay.
My only caution for potential visitors is that if you are a light sleeper, be sure to take the front bedroom."

The snacks and coffee, comfortable beds, and plush throws in the living room all made for a cozy and welcoming space. He communicated promptly and was helpful when needed. I sometimes have trouble falling asleep and was concerned the highway noise would be a problem but it did not keep me from sleeping. Since our departure we have missed having coffee with the fireplace on in the morning and watching the geese run around. We would absolutely stay here again!"

The master bath shower was spacious and water instantly hot. They had baby items and some toys our kids enjoyed playing with. We didn’t cook during our stay but the kitchen was spacious and well stocked.
We had a small issue the night we checked in and Tim responded immediately and took care of the issue asap.
There was a book full of recommendations for restaurants and more. It was a 10 minute drive to downtown and less than 15 min to U of I campus. This rental was perfect for our family and we look forward to renting again for future trips to Champaign/U of IL."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful, well appointed home. You can tell hosts put lots of thoughts and love into this place. Kitchen is stock well and updated. There's coffee machine which came with capsules. Since I am not a coffee drinker, I opted for the tea assortment instead. Filter water inside the refrigerator makes it convenient if you didn't have time to grab bottle water on the way into the town. The memory foam beds are very comfortable with soft linens. Walk in tub is a nice surprise, just had to remind our kids not to open it with water in it. The location may appear to be on the out-skirt of Champaign, it's only 10-15 minutes to places like Target, Walmart, Costco, UIUC, and Airport. The host was responsive to our needed, we would definitely come again when we visit our daughter again."

The apartment itself was clean, beautifully appointed, and just the right amount of space for me. I took some notes about the neutral decor for my own home!

Stayed a few nights","This was a lovely stay! The place was better than described! I immediately felt safe and parking was good too.
The guest area was well maintained, clean, and better than expected! There were additional fans, which was wonderful since I forgot mine. The bathroom was every bit a hotel experienceand the bedroom was top notch. They had blackout curtains in addition to the blinds, which was very nice. The bed was clean and firm.
I traveled for work (which is outdoors) so wasn't too interested in being outside afterwards so I didn't take advantage of the outdoor amenities, but they were very nice! There were good places to eat and visit nearby as well.
I will definitely want to stay here again if I work in the area!"

Otherwise this place had everything we needed, I hate to write a negative review but I wish I’d known to expect this about the bed, as we just needed a place to crash before getting back on the road. We are two fit, healthy adults and are used to life on the road / sleeping in a variety of beds, but this one was particularly uncomfortable and I barely slept. If the mattress were to be replaced we would totally stay here again because the place is lovely!"

But it wasn’t a surprise as she mentioned it in the listing (TY) and we thought for one night we could deal with it as the place was so lovely on all other wants.

The house was easy to find, exactly as described, and truly a great rental option for me in this situation. My only suggestion would be to add a shelf in the shower so there is a spot to put your shampoo/face wash/etc., but honestly that's such a minor thing! :) If I find myself back in Champaign, Hope's place is definitely on my list."
