Stayed a few nights","Noise from all night trains keep waking us. Bed way too high for old people hard to get in and out. No T.V. in bedroom, bedroom could have a night light. Very clean, useful well-appointed kitchen, furniture seemed old but clean very uncomfortable, air condition very loud. Food and shopping very close. Noise is the biggest problem without it would have gotten 4 stars."

Stayed one night","Was amazing! I am a frequent air b&b customer. At times things aren’t what you expected for your stay! However, this was beyond our expectations. She mentioned the train and the noise. Yes there was a train and a little noise. What you got for charm, location, cleanliness and overall experience, far outweighs a little noise. Which I thought added to the charm! I live in SC and commute to fla for work bi monthly. This will be a regular stop! Btw, the wings around the corner were the best!!!!"

Stayed one night","Yet ANOTHER wonderful stay at the Studio on Main, Loft. What started out as a half point on our way north has now become favorite a destination. The Loft is spotless clean and as comfortable as it beautifully decorated!!!…..Regina’s communication & recommendations(both local & surroundings cities) are on point! Wish I could give more than 5 stars for everything in regards to the Loft and the quaint little historic downtown of Tifton. If time permits give yourself a few extra days to explore, shop, dine, meet the locals and even share a glass of wine & friendly conversation with Regina & Arch! My husband and I had an outstanding lunch & dinner at Taco Loco….excellent food, excellent service and very pet friendly!!!! Can’t wait to go back and stay longer!!!!"

It's such a creative use of a downtown building. It is spotless and tastefully decorated. We enjoyed being right in the heart of quaint Tifton and had a glass of wine in the shared space out back.
We're looking forward to our next trip. By the way, check out the 305 Latin Eatery right around the corner while you're there. Being from south Florida, I can attest that the food is so authentic that it's like being transported home."

Stayed one night","What a wonderful little apartment! Very clean, everything we needed, and easy to find. Regina provided great communication, easy instructions, and even walkable restaurant recommendations (which we took by the way)! This was great for our 1 night stay and would be perfect for longer stays as well.
My only recommendation would be to raise the light in the bathroom. It barely hangs at 6’ and my hubby is 6’4”. That could have caused an injury in the dark. With those beautiful high ceilings there’s plenty of room to go up a foot or so."

Stayed one night","I can't say enough about this experience-even though I was only there for ~12 hours. Place was exactly as described! Regina was incredibly helpful and responsive via check-in. I arrived later than planned, but felt 100% safe at check-in as the area was incredibly well-lit. The unit itself was beautiful and even bigger in real life than expected. The next morning I enjoyed walking around town - grabbed coffee at Mi-Lady bakery (which I later learned was a big mistake to not try any of their doughnuts - will be sure to do so next time!). And I just overall am SO glad I drove a little bit out of the way to stay at this AirBnB. I will definitely be back and highly recommend it to anyone. The back patio was the perfect place for morning reading and yoga, too!"

Stayed one night","STOP reading reviews and book this place before it’s gone!!!! Hate to share this gem, but I simply must!!! My husband and I booked last min.(due to travel changes)…
Regina went out of her way to make the arrangements completely hassle free after a long drive, including spot on dining recommendations & ent. 10/10 for QUICK communication, cleanliness & comfort! What started out to be a quick last minute stop turned into an extended stay and hopefully lifelong friendships!!! Take the time sit with Regina & Arch(coffee & couch)ha ….both are a wealth of local information! Arch has a ton of old time stories(John Deer & Kabota)….Regina has a very talented son and loves to share stories about his travels… meet the locals if you have time, let them share stories of the south… you won’t be sorry!!!! I can’t say enough about our stay & experiences we had in this small friendly humble town with the best host we’ve had to date!!! Dining: The Local….food was AMAZING!!!! Try the Baryard Barbie 🍸"

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay! This was an overnight stop on a 12 hour road trip, so unfortunately we weren’t there for long but we were very comfortable while we were. The space was well appointed, you could easily stay here for an extended period. There was plenty of hot water and good pressure in the shower (something that can make or break a stay for me) and the linens were good quality. The mattress was great, we slept really well. Parking is literally steps from the door which was extremely convenient for loading/unloading. The only potential negative is the proximity to the train tracks, in fairness the listing does mention this. We travel with a white noise machine so it was a non-issue for us when it came time for bed. But just be aware, you’re close enough that you can see the tracks from the living room window and several trains will likely come through, so if you’re a light sleeper be prepared. Regina was a thoughtful and attentive host with great communication!"

This isn’t anything that would stop me from returning. There wasn’t much to do within walking distance as others mentioned, maybe because it was a Sunday?

Was good place to stop and rest on our trip. You can hear street noise in the front, which spooked our pup a little, but we were warned that the unit was directly on the street."

Stayed a few nights","This house was beautiful—giant ceilings, very nice furnishings—although not a very comfortable couch, and the giant front windows left me feeling kind of exposed despite the shades. The neighbors were friendly and the main strip next to it had a few fun antique shops and hippie store (don’t bother with the clothing store, unless you can afford $60 for a tank top). Unfortunately, the area outside of the main strip, like a block away in any direction, was really unfriendly and generally unsafe feeling. If you plan to stick to the antique stores and your apartment then you’re good, but don’t try walking to the grocery store."

The space was spotlessly clean, beds super comfortable. We had opportunity to walk outside a bit, interact with the resident cat and see the chickens and ducks. The turntable with vinyl records was a wonderful touch as well. Although located outside of town, we were able to get to local restaurants within about 5 to 10 minutes so definitely not remote.
We would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend to other travelers through Tifton."

We enjoyed sitting on the upper screened in porch in the morning and watching the sunrise, sipping coffee and hot tea, and reading our devotionals. Not a far drive into Tifton where all of the shopping and restaurants are.
The only issue we had was slow internet, which gave some interruptions while watching a game and getting some laptop work done, but that was the only issue we had.
We fully enjoyed listening to the records that are there, and there are many great books available on the downstairs bookshelf. The grounds are beautiful, and the hosts are so friendly, welcoming, and responsive.
Would definitely stay again!"

The host was very responsive. We didn’t have any issues, but I’m sure they’d have been resolved quickly if necessary. Our only bummer was the four or five wasps inside the screened patio - didn’t want our exuberant toddler to get too close and possibly stung, so we skipped spending time out there. On the whole though, it was a wonderful experience! We’d 100% stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Im already planning my trip to come back. This place was my “farmy country” slice of heaven. You drive up to chickens walking around and their adorable cat Chuma greeted me when I parked. It has very basic supplies inside but it was perfect for me. The home isn’t too far from town but it feels like you’re in the middle of nowhere in a good way. If you plan on traveling with anyone, keep in mind the beds face each other since there is only one bedroom and bathroom. The kitchen only has a microwave and a mini fridge with a freezer that can really only hold a ice tray. The wifi didn’t work for me but my cell service worked perfectly. I loved this Airbnb and I cannot wait to come back."

Rather than a sterile hotel room, which I stayed at on the way to Atlanta, I found myself in a beautiful setting essentially from a different time. Throughout the house, there are helpful, kind handwritten notes Camely cares deeply about her guests, and takes rightful pride and the beautiful space. I look forward to returning and spending more time."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great Air BNB experience. Our host created a LOVELY, relaxing atmosphere in her quaint little cottage. Don't let the neighborhood fool you- once you go into this charming cottage, you'll see just how thoughtful and thorough Camely is. You could pack a few clothes and a little groceries and not need anything else to have a very comfortable stay here. Camely's provisions show she truly cares about your experience and she is very communicative in case any needs arise. But we needed nothing because everything was great as it was!
I am so thankful for our relaxing weekend here!"

There was tons of space to run around and a fantastic outdoor living space to enjoy! The house was gorgeous, with zero clutter and was pristinely clean! 10/10 recommend! I also found that is was more than fairly priced! Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights","This house was even prettier in person than the photos. We thought the design choices were so thoughtful and striking. The tub was particularly great, and the shower wand attachment was a wonderful feature. The kitchen is large, with several appliances to be able to cook at home. For future guests, you may want to bring/buy your own pantry staples, as the house did not have some basics we were looking for (aluminum foil, plastic wrap, matches/lighter for candles, even paper/pens, laundry pods, etc).
The property was quiet, which is what we were hoping for. There are neighboring homes that are visible, so it's not totally secluded if you're looking for that. There's a grocery store nearby & several dining options. Locals were friendly. It was too cold for the pool, and the hot tub didn't get quite hot enough for us, but it was a cold night, so that may have been why.
We would return to this property for sure and really enjoyed our stay. The hosts were responsive and flexible."

We'd recommend this place in Norman Park, GA to anyone and everyone looking for some peace and quiet at a wonderful home. Almost forgot, shopping and restaurants are just minutes away, yet you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere. Thanks Blanche & Shaun!"

Stayed with kids","This Airbnb was absolutely wonderful! Blanche and his wife Vicki very responsive and helpful if you had any questions. Three bedrooms, five beds in total in the entire home. A washer and dryer in the back was very convenient for our stay. In the master bedroom, the bedside tables have USB plugs, which is very convenient, especially at the end of the night. The mattress in the master bedroom is adjustable! Several Kitchen utensils. The only thing that was somewhat bothersome was: at night in the master bedroom bathroom, it’s really hard to take a shower due to the fact that the window is so wide, and there are no curtains to close if you need to shower, late at night, so you have to use the spare bathroom if you don’t want to feel like you’re not being watch lol. Also, the property doesn’t have much light, so if you arrive home late in the evening, it can be scary. Other than that, the Airbnb is definitely worth the stay, and the money! Highly recommend everyone stay here in Georgia!!"

We had 4 adults staying with plenty of space for all of us and more. 3 well appointed bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, large kitchen/living room, and a huge covered deck. The kitchen and baths were well appointed. We didn’t use the washer/dryer but the AirBnB included a large laundry room. Location instructions were clear and though on a large secluded lot, it was close to all local amenities. We had a wonderful stay despite our sad reason for staying. I highly recommend this AirBnB."

Stayed over a week","This house was a blast if you love to have your own private pool home away from all the hustle. There is a Walmart and Publix within 6 minutes driving, restaurants are available in Moultrie and if you are looking for some chain restaurants and shopping, head your way to Tilton or Valdosta. The house was spacious and looked just as in the pictures. We really enjoyed the spacious kitchen, all the provided kitchen utensils, the big couch and television, the Serra beds in the master bedroom, the spacious bathroom and the big outside pool. With these hot temperatures the pool water was even warm and after a thunderstorm with some rain it was refreshing cold again. We used the kitchen to prepare our own meals. Blanche and Vicky responded quick to our questions. We had a cleaning issue at check-in and they responded fast and came in action on the spot. We really appreciated that. Also when the air conditioning was malfunctioning, they responded quick and fixed the problem in a timely matter."

Stayed with kids","Absolutely loved staying staying at Blanche’s place. The huge pool and covered deck made for a great family vacation. There’s not much to do in Moultrie (the closest town), but we were happy to stay “home” for most of the trip. Our kids loved running around the giant yard, then we all cooled off in the pristine pool. My husband loved sitting on the deck at night watching the storms rolling in. We had a gray rainy day, but the big screen TV, board games, and kids books kept everybody from being bored.
The giant master bathroom was an entire experience in itself too. Loved the huge shower. Everything was clean and easily accessible. We made good use of the Ninja coffee maker every day! Our only complaint was that our stay wasn’t long enough. A great spot for a family getaway, and a great way to kick off the summer."

The local towns people were very nice too.
However, the other bathroom (not in the master) was a little bit dirty when we got there.
All in all, this house was very nice to spend a couple days in and relax!
Thank you so much! We really enjoyed it!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful house!! We LOVE staying there! Definitely we will go back in summer. Beautiful couple! Very friendly and ready to help . Property extremely clean! . You actually do not need anything beside your clothes.
I personally packed MANY things that never used as extra BLANKETS, towels, shampoo, kitchen things etc…. The house has everything you need.
Next time I will pack only my clothes. My kids love the house and we felt very safe for them to play outside, nothing around, very quiet. Walmart at 7 min, Publix 5 min and gas station 4 min.
100% RECOMMENDED!!!!!
Nice place if you want to pray !"

Very nice to come back to and relax after visiting family in the area. The highlights for me were: very peaceful and private, hot tub/firepit on porch was nice, kitchen had everything we needed, master bedroom and bathroom were next level amazing. I don't have anything bad at all to say and the value that you get from this compared to other locations would be really tough to beat. This place was around 35 minutes from my friends/family and was absolutely worth the short and enjoyable drive through the country. If you want your own slice of the country in a great space then this is for you. Would not hesitate to book again on a future trip!"

Stayed one night","Pictures and descriptions are accurate. This is a nice, clean, very comfortable stay. Everything is modern, functional, and well maintained. We didn't use the pool but the water was crystal clear and inviting. Having owned a pool, I can appreciated the effort that goes into keeping this one in such pristine condition. A high level of effort is evident throughout the house in design, cleaning, and maintenance.
I must comment on the king bed: the mattress is modern, firm, and comfortable and it has an adjustable frame which is all great but... the adjustable frame is placed up on top of a tall traditional frame with the end result of the bed being very high off the ground. This ""high bed"" look has become a thing I guess, I see it here and there in our travels but for us (5'10"" and 5'3""), the difficulty of getting on and off outweighs any aesthetics so we're not the biggest fans. That wouldn't stop me from staying again but it might be a consideration for some seniors who might be more comfortable using the queen bed. Luckily, this stay provides options.
All in all, it's really hard to go wrong with this stay."

It was private, quiet and as said BEAUTIFUL! Mrs. Blanche is an amazing host and I appreciate all she does to accommodate her guest! She was quick in her replies and her husband was even willing to come out and light the fire pit for us because apparently we are not as smart as we thought lol!! Thank you so much for allowing us this experience! We will definitely be booking again in the near future!!!!"

Stayed with kids",This was an amazing stay with very amazing Hosts. I loved everything about this stay. I honestly wished that I could’ve booked longer. I would give this location a 10 star rating if I could. My family and I travel all over so we know a good Airbnb when we stay in one. My kids enjoyed the pool. I enjoyed sitting on the large deck around the fire pit while listening to some of my favorite songs. The beds were so comfortable that I told my husband we should order beds just like them. Cooking in the kitchen made me feel as if I was on a tv cooking show. My kids also enjoyed the many games to choose from. We watched a movie as a family on the large tv in the living room. There was even an office for me to get some reading in and catch up on some emails. The laundry room was an added bonus as we were able to wash before heading to our next destination. It was our wedding anniversary and the hosts even had a gift for us. We will definitely be back soon.

The spotless home was comfy & cozy and much larger than expected. With 2 full both rooms and tubs I was excited to take a nice relaxing bath after our long road trip which started in AZ a couple days ago. We slept very well in the King bed. This home is on a large lot in a very peaceful neighborhood. We felt totally safe leaving our truck full parked here. The home seemed miles away from everything but yet close for us travelers to jump off highway and back on quickly to continue our journey. Close to a few restaurants as well. We had amazing pizza delivered! We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for your hospitality

Stayed a few nights","This is our second visit to Shalom House. We loved it so much the first time we had to return quickly. This time for three nights though you would probably want to enjo y it longer. The house is well appointed and seems spacious due to the mirrors and explansive view of the lake as well as the Screened porch. There are many outdoor areas to enjoy all the nature and animals they have as well as fishing which I did this time and last time. We cooked all our meals and stayed cozy even when cold because there are covered areas to sit and/or fish. If you want to relax this is the place. This was part of a longer trip for my 60th Bday and it was nice to bring in the New Year in peace and quiet. I even read a book! We will be back again on our travels . Private but very responsive( they are right on the same property but only see her and Hank when they are feeding the animals, cutting the grass or responding to your requests should you have any). I highly recommend this place to others."

Stayed with a pet","Margaret was responsive and accommodating as a host. The location is on the outskirts of town, about 12 minutes. It is an “off grid” feel so that has to be what you are looking for. The cabin is right next door to the main home but felt very private. It was a serene, peaceful, quiet and relaxing setting. It definitely encourages you to slow down. The cabin is as pictured, so keep in mind the bathroom is small and it is an older cabin (not updated). However, it was clean which was important to us. I would encourage the owners to repair the wooden walkway to the cabin. My mom is elderly and I was concerned she could trip and fall in this area. It is well marked where there is cause for concern and they have boards over other damaged area but could be an issue for some. The pond was relaxing to be next to and we enjoyed a short visit with their goats and ducks. We only stayed one night and it was perfect for what we needed. Thanks Margaret!"

Stayed with a pet","This is what I consider the quintessential Airbnb experience, someone truly inviting us into their own personal home and carefully curated space with their distinct style and personality. If I am going to stay in the country, I want a country experience complete with roosters crowing and row deer heads looking at me upon waking. I thought it was great!
The area is so beautiful and peaceful. My only regret is that we arrived so late at night and left so quickly after awakening to get back on our time- crunched road trip that I didn't have enough time to savor this beautiful place. If at all possible, allow yourself more time to sit and just stare at the lake and enjoy the beauty of being in the country."

Stayed a few nights","I wish we had arrived earlier because it was hard to leave once I got attached to it. The pond is beyond words, for the avid fisherperson especially. I didnt know I would be able to fish from several areas in my PJS and still watch my kids, right out the backdoor, all day long :) My sons enjoyed the large screened porch. If you do not like taxidermy you might have a problem, otherwise there is plenty of space for you and your family. The view out the windows with the self retracting type blinds as needed for sun or light, or privacy was great and made it seem much bigger. There is a fire pit (where we got too many bug bites, our fault) and a small playset for younger kids. You can walk out on the walkway to look at the goats. There were also some kind of Guinea fowl, I think, and Mallard family of ducks. I caught 3 catfish, 2 turtles and a Bass. There is a cleaning station ,but we release. We will be back again for a little bit longer stay with Margaret and Hank. Highly recommend!"

The setting is very charming with a pond complete with ducks and a view of a pasture with goats and a pretty adorable donkey. It feels very private and being city folks we especially appreciated the dark and quiet. We could hear frogs and see stars. The cabin was clean and the beds were very comfortable.

The cabin is animal themed with dear mounts and a beautiful bobcat. The loft area has three beds in addition to the queen bed downstairs. The highlight of our stay was feeding the goats and donkey fresh carrots. My daughter and her friend, our neighbor, both thought this was the greatest thing to do. Margaret was pleasant and friendly.

We wished we had stayed longer but unfortunately we were traveling back home and could only stay one night. The pond was amazing in the morning , the birds and plants with such a lovely aroma. If we ever visit the area again we would love to stay here again. We highly recommend it, away from the city and noise. Definitely good for stargazing. A+ thanks again for being such a great host."

A very relaxing stay with everything we needed provided, plus a couple extra little touches that were appreciated. Air conditioning worked great and was quiet. Kitchen was very clean and had everything we needed. Margaret was quick to respond to any questions. We couldn’t have designed a better stay for what we needed. If you’ll be visiting Tifton, I highly recommend Shalom House."

The queen bed downstairs is fairly firm without the memory foam topper or nice and soft with the topper. The large kitchen was nice as I cook even when traveling. The fireplace was awesome - beautiful and very functional for warmth. The sleeping and living areas are one and the same. The bathroom is small, but very nice with a great shower. The remodel was well done, except the kitchen cabinets are vintage. Everything in the kitchen works great. Lots of space with a screened porch and a back patio and dock for fishing. There is a playground set for children. It was easy to find. It is obviously well set up for large groups also. We highly recommend."

The property is beautiful with lots of parking and the Hosts are around if you need anything at all. It was my son's graduation so we cooked in the large kitchen and could even gather outside on the enclosed patio. You can even sit on the second patio while you are grilling and watch the goats, ducks and even the blue herons by the pond. Overall it felt like home away from home you won't be disappointed!"

From the moment we rang the doorbell and noticed the red ribbon covering doorway, to the fish symbol on her main house, we knew this was going to a great place to stay. This was a God ordained place for us to be. The water and animals, were just icing on the cake for us. Margaret allowed us to check in early without any questions. My favorite part was seeing her son wondering along the waters edge, and singing his heart out. This is definitely a place we will revisit."

The photos of the outside part of the property do not do the place justice! The land itself is incredibly beautiful, especially when the flowers are in bloom! The inside is a ""hunters cabin"" theme (read below about the decor). Please note that the location of the property in Georgia makes WiFi and cell service a bit fickle.
THE BREAKFAST
We had one of the most amazing breakfasts we've ever had! Margaret & Hank's homemade waffles, blueberry sauce, and whipped cream were incredible! We highly recommend!
THINGS TO NOTE
(1) Please note that the ""leopard room"" photo attached to the listing is a separate space that is inside the main house and not part of the cabin. When renting the cabin, you get a large open layout where one of the beds is on the main floor and then the other 3 beds are in the loft space.
(2) Additionally, I also wanted to note that there is quite a bit of taxidermy displayed in the space for those that may not have encountered that before or do have a phobia. There are multiple deer, antlers, fish, birds, and some type of bob cat displayed. The theme of the place is a ""hunters cabin"" so just make sure you are personally okay with that before you book the place
Overall, our stay at the cabin was very nice and it was great for the five friends to reunite after 4 years and attend a wedding. We appreciate Margaret and Hank's hospitality!"

Stayed with kids","Lovely, relaxing retreat on a pond! We enjoyed the cabin for a quick night in the middle of a long drive. The breakfast—all organic, all homemade was also delicious! There were accommodations for our baby and the property was wonderful.
Just as side note—this is about 10 miles off the interstate, which makes it very secluded, but not a quick hop on hop off from the highway. Also, there are a lot of taxidermied animals (deer, bobcat, ducks) hung up in the cabin. Very well done, and very cool to look at, but PETA fans should probably stick to a hotel."

Stayed with kids","Although we didn't get a chance to meet our hosts (we had about 9-10 hour drive and arrived late), we thoroughly enjoyed their beautiful cabin.
The location would be perfect as a destination in and of itself for a group or family. They have fishing, goats, a deck, kitchen, etc.
I was able to squeeze in one solo game of pool during our stay on their pool table.
The location is tastefully decorated and impressive. If you are not a fan of mounted game, this is not the place for you, but if you are a fan, don't pass this place up.
Our 13 month old loved running around in the space, which surprisingly didn't have much for her to get into, which was nice."

My family especially liked the pool table; also the loft sleeping area that you access with a spiral staircase is a treat. Extra activities are available if you take the time—a fishing dock, and a fire pit for roasting marshmallows—looked nice ( we didn’t take the time as the kids wanted to watch a video). Watching the sunset while sitting by the large pond was a peaceful treat for me."

They do have a well thought out rule book when you get there, looks like a daunting read at first, but it’s only a few pages of reasonable suggestions.
This place is secluded so if you need cell service don’t count on it. And if you need solid WiFi, this is not your place."

Stayed one night","Located off the ""beaten path"" but not too hard to find; this place is definitely a must-do if you're traveling to or through South Georgia. It is a wonderful place to retreat, rest and enjoy the simple goodness of nature yet it accommodates your ""tech"" needs, only if you choose to stay connected.

I read the reviews about the fishing, but catching fish has never held my interest until I came to this lovely place. Who knew catch & release fishing can help relieve stress! And to sit next to the lake and watch goats go about their daily lives can really ""make you put your phone down"" - after you've recorded them😄.
The host(s) Margaret and little Ms Tyler along with the littlest host, Shiver(i hope i got his name correct) were most accompanying. And even Goldilocks herself could sleep comfortably in every bed in the house!!!
I could go on about my stay but I'll end by simply saying that the Shalom House is Awesome!"

Stayed one night","What a find. A perfect getaway for an individual, couple OR family. We stayed in the Pond House and it was incredible. It really felt like we were on vacation, at a private, luxurious hunting cabin. Margaret was a gracious and accommodating host, and even brought breakfast to our cabin instead of us eating it in the house since I am allergic to the cats that live in the main house. This place would be PERFECT for a city-dwelling family that has youngsters. They can fish, play on the playground, run around, and just hang out! The loft has a double bed and two twin beds, and the main room has a double bed. Technically it could sleep 6 in beds, but there is also a couch and love seat! Wifi worked fine, cable TV was fine, bedding was comfortable, and we really felt like we had a retreat. When we left to head to Atlanta, we drove north on Highway 41, roughly parallel to I-75 and had a cultural experience as we identified all different types of agriculture - melons, pecan groves, cotton and peanut fields, and some fabulous small and charming small towns. We will go back and recommend it to others."

I've never seen a 'bucket garden"", so walking around this garden was very interesting! There were several peppers that were so pretty they made my mouth water!

Stayed with kids","We stayed at the Sleepy Stallion on March 20-26th. Emma answered all my questions quickly and effectively; although when it is time to leave the house and go somewhere, I put the bottom lock on not realizing we would not be able to get back in, so I had to contact Emma at midnight so she can unlock the door. When you leave, you have to shut the door and then hit lock. I think clearer instructions need to be placed on Airbnb so this won’t be an issue anymore for future guests. The last thing I would recommend is better furniture. The couch and other chairs are so bad on the back, especially if you have back problems. Other than that, the house is great, great location, and Emma will go out of her way to make your stay enjoyable. We appreciate everything Emma done for us during our stay and the house is nice, safe, and convenient to restaurant’s and shops."

The experience was an unforgettable and we cherish each memory we’ve made this trip. We truly appreciate all the blankets that were left we really needed them for this cold weather we had. I would definitely recommend and return to this home in near future.

Location was in a peaceful neighborhood, and easy to find. Worked perfect for What we needed. Beds are comfortable. Five minutes to many dining options, grocery stores and Wal-Mart. We were not able to get the wifi to work, but we didn't bother her with it, and just used our own hotspots when we needed to. We will definitely stay here again soon, as it is the perfect location, and very comfy."

Stayed one night","Nostalgic, comfortable, exceptionally clean, calm aesthetics and easy access make Hannah’s Traveler’s Rest a place we would return to without hesitation. Loved the location in a quaint and quiet older neighborhood and great to be less than 5 miles from I-75. It was a good overnight stay as we passed through. The Suite was spotlessly clean and had all we needed for our one night stay. The bedroom with a comfy bed and room darkening curtains made for a very good nights sleep. We did not find the sound machine necessary. Waking up in a back yard versus a busy hotel was pleasant. Hannah gave great recommendations for dinner and was super responsive to any message we sent her."

Stayed a few nights","The distant rumble of a freight train is always hauntingly lonely and somehow romantic. — Its horn is a signal of enormous power along with a warning of possible peril to anyone in its path. — The heartbeat of an active economy along the steel arteries of our country.
Hannah’s quiet suite provided a peaceful place for my Tifton visit: A K-cup coffee machine, microwave, and fridge. The bathroom was clean. I loved the wood floor. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. The WiFi handled my data-heavy tasks with delightful speed. The arrival and departure instructions were simple and easy to follow.
Hannah was quick to respond to my questions and concerns about my fluctuating itinerary. Amid the stress of a family member’s medical challenges, her flexibility was a distinct comfort."

As soon as we arrived Hannah checked in and provided a helpful link to the guidebook for local food options. We got takeout at Osaka and made a quick trip to Espresso 41 for a coffee. Everything was very easy to find. Hannah made sure to make our morning easy and provided a great selection of breakfast bars and coffee so we didn't have to venture out to find food before going to the college. Since our stay was only one night, it was so nice to wake up and relax before having to leave. Her place is perfectly decorated and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again! Very deserving of 5 stars!"

Stayed about a week","Heartfelt Thanks and 5-Star Review for Val and Hannah:
I recently had the pleasure of staying with Val and Hannah in Tifton, GA, under particularly challenging circumstances as I was in town for a funeral. From the very beginning of my stay to the end, Val and Hannah were the epitome of gracious hosts.
Their hospitality and thoughtfulness knew no bounds – they went the extra mile to ensure that all my needs were not just met, but exceeded. Communication was efficient and effortless, assisting in making my arrangements less stressful during this tough time.
A special mention must be made about the parking arrangements they provided; creating a space for me in their carport was much appreciated and just one of many examples of how Val and Hannah cater to their guests with care.
Circumstances required me to extend my stay not once, but twice. Val and Hannah handled these changes seamlessly and with such kindness, it truly stood out. They were incredibly accommodating."

Stayed a few nights","We needed to stay at a place in Tifton due to a couple different reasons. Hannah’s place was clean and welcoming. We didn’t know how we would like the set up because it is connected to a larger home but we could barely hear anything from the larger home. The only issue I had was prior to booking I asked for a late checkout a little after 5, Hannah agreed, so I booked. Then later I was told by my new job that I would be at a site 45 minutes away. So I immediately contacted Hannah to see if she could accommodate that time But was then told that no late check out could be accommodated at all due to cleaner and that we had to leave by 11AM. On the other hand we were told that we could pay for an additional night to give us extra time. Which we did not plan on staying another night. I had to make other arrangements for the other person staying with me to leave by 11. Which was a bit of an inconvenience and not what was agreed to prior to booking. Other than that the stay had no issues."

Stayed one night","The place is like a one bedroom beautiful cottage on the back of the lot of another home. The pictures accurately portray the cottage which is accessed from Love Lane which at one time may have been like a back ally way to the homes at the front of the lot. I was thankful for both the grassed lot area across the road and the nice park one block away since I travel with my little dog which needed to be walked. The home in front of the lot has several large dogs which they occasionally let outside in the chain link fenced area to one side of the cottage. However, if the dogs bark, they are prompt about putting them back in the house. There is a portion of privacy fence along the chain link fence which prevents the dogs from being a problem is you are sitting on the porch of the cottage. Parking is on the side of the cottage next to Love Lane. Be sure to read the rules or inquire about them. The host was great and accommodating."

Stayed with a pet","Mr. Hale was a wonderful host! He communicated well and gave great directions to the place. Anytime we needed anything he was easily available.
This little nest was perfect for our stay. It was clean, quiet, and absolutely well worth it. I will definitely be staying again when I come to town. Thank you so much!
You will not be disappointed if you book here."

Stayed one night","This was a pit stop as we traveled home from the holidays - great choice! Frederick’s place was clean, spacious & the perfect place to rest after a long drive. Located very close to a grocery store, pharmacy & local restaurants. Next time we are traveling through we will definitely be back!"

Stayed one night","The host was AMAZING and very thorough with his communication. The rental is comfortable has everything you will need and is very close to a nice park. Two considerations to note: 1. go off of the host's directions because G maps are inaccurate. 2. If you are a light sleeper bring a loud noise machine and ear plugs as you will hear traffic noise, neighbor's dogs barking, etc. from the bedroom."

Stayed one night","It’s a nice, brand new place that has all the essentials—full kitchen with brand new appliances, working desk, island with barstools, washer/dryer, full bath and bedroom. Everything is just as written and shown on the pictures. The place is on an alley that’s near the downtown area. Even with the directions for the GPS, Apple Maps showed that the place was on the right, when it was actually on the left. However, I looked around, I saw it. Frederick was a responsive host and I would recommend staying here, especially if you have business in Tifton!"

Stayed a few nights",This home was more than I expected! It is fairly new and very clean. Everything listed was accurate and available. The check in/out process was easy and convenient as well. The home is located in an alley so it is somewhat private. I will definitely be back again!

Stayed with kids","So I’ve never had a host who made up a book of everything that was in the local area. Although I knew the area that book was so helpful it told us how to use things inside the home. It was so great. I wish all Airbnb’s would do this. The place was absolutely beautiful and I would absolutely love to come back there and stay again. Hot tub wassssss amazing the entire experience was amazing and relaxing. So if anybody is planning a getaway , I definitely recommend."

Stayed with kids",My family and I enjoyed our stay at Zach's house it was clean and refreshing. The park was lovely and restaurant's were just a short distance away. The only draw back is there wasn't a washer/dryer in the home had we stayed longer that would have been a disappointing factor but our visit was 2 days. I highly recommend Zach's home.
