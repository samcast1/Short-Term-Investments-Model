Group trip",It was a very beautiful cabin and the setting was so peaceful. It had everthing I needed for my little get away. There were just a couple things we had problems with but nothing terrible. We just had a little trouble with the hot tub temperature button. But once we got it to temp we had a blast. Then the other was the mattresses. Unfortunately for us they just weren't the stlye for us to sleep comfortably. They were very clean but just not comfortable. Only thing I would change from my trip would have been to make it at least another one or two days longer. Very beautiful cabin and scenery.

Group trip","I just love staying at Broomsage cabin! It's close to town but far enough out that is peaceful, pretty views. We seen several deer and even seen an eagle! The antics of a couple squirrels had us laughing.
The hot tub was amazing! Definitely enjoyed that a few times during our stay.
We will definitely be returning!"

The wrap around porch is where spent most of our time, listening to the sounds of the woods and we were lucky enough to see deer a few times!"

Stayed with a pet","Enjoyed our stay here. Host was very responsive to questions. The cabin was full of amenities that make for a very comfortable stay, including the kitchen which had more than everything you’d need (from aluminum foil and Tupperware to icecream scoop and kids utensils)! We loved having a washer/dryer. There was plenty of room to spread out in the cabin and to sleep for our family of 6.
Beautiful property. It was lovely to sit on the porch in rocking chairs with coffee and watch nature and the kids as they played.
The kids really enjoyed the hot tub. That especially made the stay worth it!
Locally, we explored the Bluespring Caverns (a gem!), Spring Mill State Park, Paynestown and Hardin Ridge recreation area, and parts of the Hoosier National Forest.
Very much worth staying here!"

Group trip",Planned a weekend get away with a small group of friends. It was a nice little break from reality right in our own backyard. Such a cozy atmosphere with amazing views. The only complaint is the hot tub was not staying at proper temp but that wasn’t a huge problem as we had plenty of other stuff there to do and I’m sure it was a simple solution. Tresia is an amazing host and has every thing you could think of needing there. Everyone had an amazing time. We would love to come back for another visit soon. Thank you so much for sharing your property with!

Stayed with a pet",My family of 5 and I absolutely loved staying at this cabin! So many great things about the property from sitting in the hot tub watching the sunrise over the valley to playing the provided board games for hours after dinner each night. The kitchen was very well stocked and ready to use but it is just minutes from many stores in case you need something. Although we didn't use the outdoor firepit (it was January) there we camping chairs in the cabinet also which would have been great to use. You can tell lots of time and planning went into prepping this cabin for guests. The property was updated and spotlessly clean plus everything worked perfectly. We will be back as there are many State parks to explore in the area also!

Stayed a few nights","We arrived late Sat. pm in absolute dark but didn't have any trouble locating the house. We immediately got into the hot tub,  but didn't stay in long as the temp was basically luke warm and outside was below 40. 
We struggled for about 2 hrs Sat. am to get the hot tub warmer. The hostess responded quickly and sent the prop. mgr over, but it never worked. We gave up on the tub and (gratefully!!) sat in the jacuzzi until the aches from the previous day's hike went away. 
There's a few ponds in the valley below the cabin that are probably gorgeous in the summer. It was quiet and serene with no outside noise. There were squirrels and birds to watch, and a sm herd of deer on the opposite hill.
Unfortunately,  my hsbnd had to work at 4am Mon, cutting our stay short,  so we didn't get to wander the property or explore the area. We had intended to stay until dinner but ended up leaving before lunch.  
We wish we could've stayed the 2nd pm!"

Stayed with a pet","We needed some place to stay while major plumbing repairs were done on our home. This was the perfect place. Such a cute house! Full of charm, very welcoming and comfortable. Close to work, and easy to go back and forth to our house for things we needed. My grandma lived in this neighborhood many years ago, so it brought back sweet memories. The house is larger than the photos show. It’s been very nicely updated, while also keeping the original charm. Very well stocked with towels,etc., very nice coffee maker in the kitchen (I use k-cups breakfast blend black tea and there was only coffee-but I brought some of mine from home). Lots of charging stations for all our electronics. Best of all were the 3 gigantic tv’s! We would stay here again if we needed a place, and will keep it in mind for when our daughter and her family visit from Oregon."

We also requested a box fan , something we typically use at home , and they provided two of them for us. Our stay was for one month , they communicated when they needed to come to the house to mow the lawn or take the trash toter out/back and were always respectful of our privacy. A wonderful bonus was use of the garage to park our vehicle."

It had everything we really needed--very satisfactory--but few frills (ex: no DVD player, nightlight, or office supplies--tape/scissors). The layout of the house was nice. Our kids loved the bunk beds. Master bedroom was nice. The neighborhood was so-so, but we didn't have any problems. Some traffic noise at night. Very convenient to walk to the delicious pizza place. Parking was convenient. Intro message from Donna was friendly and complete with local recommendations and all the necessary info to access the house, etc. Worked out great for us! Would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","This quaint cabin was wonderful for our few day getaway, although we wanted to stay longer! The cabin was spacious; I brought 2 kids with me, they played hide and seek throughout the cabin. Plenty of places to sit and relax. Beautiful large windows facing the East, great view of the sun/moon rise and the East Fork White River. A relaxing porch, with a couple of rockers, off of the kitchen great to watch the sunsets. Kitchen had everything I needed to make our breakfasts/dinners. Jerry and Mary were wonderful and accommodating hosts and had wonderful touches to the cabin to make us feel at home, you can tell they enjoy hosting. Since we visited in early Spring, we were able to enjoy the abundance of gorgeous Daffodils.We were able to walk down by the river, just be aware it is a steeper grade so know your limitations, if you can't make the walk down no worries you will still have breathtaking views from the house. Close to all the day trips we planned."

Stayed a few nights","A true gem! Our only regret was not having booked a longer stay. Well-appointed cabin with all the amenities you might want. Loved the kitchen, which was stocked - bring your own spices! The living room was incredibly comfortable: gas fireplace, large east-facing windows overlooking the river and trees, plenty of seating. The outdoor firepit was perfect for taking off the evening chill. Plenty of firewood provided. The location is very private. It's a 10-minute drive into town for provisions and several restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed a 20 mile round-trip, out-and-back bike ride on the Milwaukee Trail from the center for Bedford to Williams Dam. Slight uphill most of the way out. Nicely maintained rail-to-trail. Finally, Mary and Jerry were excellent hosts. They obviously love their property, and live nearby. They checked in, offered suggestions, and even left a nice welcome arrangement of their daffodils. Perfect."

We wanted a peaceful, relaxing getaway, and that's just what we got. The property is private and absolutely beautiful, and we loved the historical aspect of the cabin. Had a great time exploring the area, and we really enjoyed grilling out on the outdoor patio, and lounging by the bonfire. Thanks for the hospitality, Jerry and Mary! We can't wait to return."

The cabin itself is perfect for a couple or small family. It is incredibly clean!!! The kitchen is also full-size and the cabin comes well stocked—we happened to forget baby bath wash, bug spray, and Qtips but it was not a problem bc those supplies were already there! The outdoor space was very well done and has a grill, fire pit, and lots of seating. Indoors we took advantage of the wide variety of DVDs and board games when we needed a break from the heat. Jerry happened to drive by when we were outside and let us know we could pick some flowers from the garden before we left. River Rock is a great value and easy proximity to other places like Brown County, Bloomington, French Lick. I would absolutely stay again!"

We enjoyed all the little touches throughout the cabin and property. The beds were super comfy & the kitchen was fully quipped and had everything needed including spices. We enjoyed sipping sangria around the fire pit & cooking dinner on the gas grill. Mary and Jerry were fabulous hosts that went above and beyond. On the day we arrived a rainstorm had come through bringing cooler temperatures with it... the gas fireplace had already been turned off for the season but Mary and Jerry were kind enough to turn it back on for us. This was an added bonus because we were able to stay indoors and play board games in front of the fireplace. The family room is also full of windows and beautiful panoramic views of the property which is abundant with wildlife and gives you the feeling that you are outdoors. We could not have picked a better place or better hosts for our annual girls trip!!!!"

Stayed with kids","Words can't describe and the photos don't do it justice! From previous reviews and photos I expected a nice cabin atmosphere, but seeing and experiencing was even more impressive. Jerry and Mary thought of many small touches that make it feel like a home away from home, from a well stocked kitchen, toiletries, spacious seating outdoors, dvds, and many throw blankets and pillows for relaxing. They were quick to respond and even checked in mid stay to see if we needed anything. The grounds were beautiful while also kid friendly, we especially loved the river view and trails. I would definitely recommend and plan to stay again!"

It helped us detach from the world, enjoy creation and reconnect as a family. Though it was cold, we visited Spring Mills Park and were so happy we did! The rugged trails rewarded us with so many incredible surprises along the way. We hope to see it all again when the weather is a bit warmer and flowers are blooming."

Stayed a few nights","This cabin is really special, cozy and serene. We wanted to be secluded without being remote and this location is perfect. The hosts are gracious, responsive and friendly. Everything was clean, charming and comfortable. The river view was tiny because of the season, but we could still see it. It will be much larger when some leaves fall. It didn’t matter because we could see the trees, wildlife and flowers, as well. We were traveling a lot so didn’t get to take advantage of the space but there is everything needed for cooking, grilling and outdoor living. We wanted to have a fire outside but it was too hot, even though it’s October. They have wood available and it’s ready to go. Crazy weather. The fireplace is gas so it’s a breeze to use. I did turn it on one morning, for a little while, and it heats the cabin in minutes. The television was perfect for my husband’s evening sports fix and we didn’t miss internet because the cell phone service was fantastic. There are many brochures available if you need ideas about activities and I appreciated the map. We went to Lincoln’s Boyhood Home Memorial and West Baden Springs Resort along with a lot of antiquing. This cabin is perfectly located for so many southern Indiana day trips. We just loved it and will definitely return. Upon leaving we did meet Jerry and he regaled us with some history of the cabin and the land, making it even more special."

Once Jerry found out we were coming to the area to explore Hoosier National Forest he very kindly went to the National Parks office to get us information and maps on trails before our arrival. We also took his suggestion to explore Spring Mill State Park on our first afternoon, an easy 10 minute drive from the cabin, which gave us a great couple of hours in the woods. We took a 12 mile hike in Hoosier the next day, enjoying the beautiful view of the river and the gas fire place at the cabin for reading and had an outdoor fire later in the evening. Mary and Jerry provided more than enough wood and we had everything we needed in the kitchen for cooking in both nights. Highly recommend this cabin for exploring the area and a quiet, relaxing time away! An easy 4.5 drive from Chicago. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","The home was spotless and had all the amenities we needed. The yard was gorgeous, the flowers were beautiful, and it was such a quiet neighborhood. Carrie was very accommodating in extending our stay one more day so we could attend a funeral without having to find another place for one night. We will defiantly go back when we visit that area again.

I recently stayed at this wonderful Airbnb and had an amazing experience. The place was super clean and had so many great amenities that made our stay very comfortable. It was incredibly cozy, and we especially loved the jukebox and fireplaces. The setting was peaceful, and the nature scenery around the property was beautiful. A special touch was the host making fresh cinnamon rolls for us, which were delicious. I came here to spend time with my mom, and it was the perfect retreat for us. Highly recommend this place!

In fact, Daryl did not raise his very reasonable rates by even one dime! We had a wonderful time. Surrounded by natural beauty, and the beds are comfortable too! I can't guarantee there will be a rainbow to greet you as there was for us, but who knows!

The location was perfect with easy access to relatives in Bloomington, Brownstown, and Seymour and close proximity to parks, like Spring Mill, walking trails and the gem and rock show in Bedford. The grandkids loved being next to the playground and the ponds and the big yard. We cooked most of our meals in and the kitchen had pretty much everything you would need.

We loved having coffee on the back porch, listening to the spring-fed creek. Jan and Chase were very responsive on the site. Avoca is a nice small town. Groceries and restaurants are less than 10 minutes away in Bedford.
The house has lots of room. Our group of seven was able to spread out. There are several comfortable gathering places in the downstairs rooms. The inside is clean, bright and freshly painted. They did a fantastic job restoring it. The house has updated furniture, decorations, and new linens and appliances alongside the 19th/20th century charm.
We made a day trip to Spring Mill State Park that really rounded out the visit, as we learned more about the Hamer family in the museum there. At the end of each day we walked along the ponds and watched the sun set over the woods. Can’t wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","We were looking for a quiet spot to rest and relax after a very busy spring, and found it at Jan and Mike's place. Their cabin is so cute and clean, and we especially loved the sunhouse. The hosts were amazing and went above and beyond with special touches such as locally made cinnamon rolls, cookies, milk, cereal, coffee and tea and other snacks. Super quiet, yet close to many interesting places to visit. We would definitely visit again."

Hilly, twisty, beautiful drives to Huber’s Orchard, Winery & Vineyards (Starlight Distillery), and short drives to Lake Monroe or Bedford.

Stayed a few nights","This experience was first class all the way! It started when my wife and I booked Pine Tree Cottage for the two of us.for a football weekend in Bloomington. Then two dear friends chose to join us for the weekend. I messaged Jan to see if there would be space in the cottage for two more people. Jan said the Cottage is just for two, then added that she would see what she could do to help us. Her solution was to upgrade us all to a new and much more spacious place on her property, “Pleasant View Lodge”, at no additional cost! This Lodge is newly built, finished by she and her husband during the few weeks leading up to our visit. What a kind and generous thing to do! And Pleasant View exceeded anything we could have expected. Attractive, roomy, just perfect for the four of us. Additionally, Jan made sure that we were stocked with absolutely everything we could ever need for our comfort. We would not suggest a thing that was missing. And the scenery on the property is just breathtaking!"

Stayed a few nights","After local power outages, our host upgraded us to a much larger lodging on the property. It was beautiful. The garden house was the most romantic place I've ever made my man take me. Allowing us to pick blueberries and roam the scenic walking path mown through the old christmas tree farm, it was just the ultimate relaxation. We had such a wonderful time hanging out at your place, we didn't get to see a third of the area attractions I'd earmarked for the trip. The host provided a light breakfast to start our daily adventures as well as a bountiful array of brochures, maps & advice for our travels. It feels very rural finding this place, but it's only minutes from a great ice cream shop and several restaurant choices (if you don't feel like cooking for yourself). There is a fire pit for roasting marshmallows and meeting any other guests, if they're out. Overall, I would say this is one of the best AirB&Bs I've ever stayed in. I highly recommend this place. There's plenty more in the area that we never got to see so we fully intend to visit this place again!"

The kindness and hospitality we encountered was unmatched and we are looking forward to a return visit to Woodcrest Farm.
Additional info: The cottage is much bigger than the photos imply. Plenty of room to stretch out. The kitchen would be great to use if someone was inclined to do so. Lovely gardens and property. Great hiking in the area."

Jan is an excellent host - good walk-through of everything when you arrive, available to answer questions (super promptly), did a bonus cookie delivery, but was otherwise quite hands-off. Like great restaurant service... magically there when you need them, leaves you alone when you don’t.
The only thing I missed was a closet or some drawers (it’s just a luggage rack situation at time of writing).
The farm cats are cute, the garden house is magical, the walk around grounds is nice and not strenuous.
This place is not fancy. But it’s 5 stars because it’s exactly as described, really clean, adorable, and comes with the best host."

Stayed a few nights","Truly one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at during my time using this service. The Airbnb is a separate building on location that feels separate from the entire farm next to a beautiful outdoor eating area, a fire pit, and rows of blueberry plants that you can pick fresh blueberries in the morning.
Inside the area is a nice large open space with all the amenities and more including a breakfast bar with cinnamon rolls and fresh blueberry muffins as well as other assorted snacks. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern.
The location is near spring mill state park which is easily a two day adventure there as well as blue spring caverns which is an underground cave river that is truly a unique experience.
Finally, the hosts were hospitable and helpful and ready to provide any needs necessary. The conversation was nice when checking in and checking out and felt like if I needed anything they would do their best to help.
Highly recommend!"

Snacks, fruit, wine and chocolates also available to enjoy in front of the fire place or after a shower complete with a heater.

Stayed a few nights",I can not say enough about this cute cottage. It was exceptionally clean and decorated so nice. Perfect for a couple. The surroundings are peaceful. It is located a quick little drive from Bedford. We enjoyed motorcycle riding around the Hoosier National Park down to the Ohio River and up to Brown County. The owners are sweet and very accommodating. They know the area very well and have great suggestions. They also have a 2 bedroom home next to the cottage that can also be rented. This would be good for families traveling with grandparents that need a break from the kiddos. My husband and I loved everything! We highly recommend staying here!

Stayed one night","Our stay at Jan’s cottage, was an unexpected treasure. When we arrived we were immediately drawn to the porch with two rockers, which faced a lovely garden room about 200 feet away, with a beautiful chandelier and comfy sitting area. It was very “Martha Stewarty”. Inside our cottage, there were twinkle lights all around the room, flickering candles, an abundance of pillows and throws, a breakfast nook with fruit, fresh pastries, cereal and coffee. Just a few steps away from our cottage we’re rows and rows of blueberry bushes. It was such a treat to be able to pick a few fresh blueberries and enjoy them in our cereal the next morning! Everything was exceptionally clean and comfortable, and the bathroom/shower was perfect. While we spent much of our time sitting on the porch enjoying the company of their sweet farm cats, we especially enjoyed our conversations with Jan and Mike. They were very accommodating and treated us like old friends instead of guest. We would recommend Jans cottage to anyone who enjoys being surrounded by natural beauty, the smell of pine trees and serenity. Thanks so much, Jan and Mike, we look forward to our next visit!"

The pictures don't do it justice. The completely fenced in yard was much larger than expected and our 2 city dogs loved playing ball and just running and roaming. We swam every single day of our stay and loved watching the sunsets each night. The firepit was great for our hotdogs and smores night. The Pavillion was great to relax or just to get out of the sun. There were so many personal touches to this place that really made our stay fantastic and wanting to come back again. Heidi and her husband were great hosts and were very friendly. They met us at the property to make sure we were comfortable with everything. Thank you for an amazing vacation with our 2 sons and 2 dogs before everyone goes back to school. You made our first Airbnb experience memorable.

The view is spectacular and the neighborhood is awesome. Beautiful sunrise and sunset views.
One of the neighbors was having a party on one of the nights of our visit. Kelsey gave us a heads up - which was much appreciated. It was relaxing and fun to hear the music and see their fireworks. Obviously, that’s not something every guest should expect to experience, but we enjoyed it.
The AC worked great as did all of the appliances and utilities. The beds were super comfortable.
Thanks again to Kelsey for hosting and for being so responsive."

The truth is that there was absolutely nothing missing, from towels, sheets, pillows, shower gel for men, for women, shampoo, conditioner.
The full kitchen, nothing was needed, condiments, kitchen utensils, pots and pans, cutlery.
The house is cozy, nice, impeccable cleanliness, the area where it is located has a wonderful atmosphere, lots of green area!!
This is Bloomington, just 20 kilometers away. It's a very healthy area between Bloomington and Bedford.
We went to both cities, we bought both cities and people very but very friendly and respectful.
I leave it in two words:

We enjoyed watching the deer in the evening after that it was hot cocoa and a warm fire inside. Jan provided enough items that we could have created a dinner out of the pantry alone. The cinnamon roles were to die for.

Jan was very accommodating and anytime I had a question, she would respond quickly.
The house was beautiful and lots of space. We loved sitting on the porch, taking in the country scene.
We will be definitely staying here again when we visit Bedford in the near future."

The home is lovely and well equipped and the location amazingly beautiful. We spent so much of our stay on the front porch enjoying the view and sounds of nature around us, rolling hills, towering trees, beatiful bird and other wildlife. We had a doe and 2 fawns gamboling on the hills in front of the house on our last day there, so much fun. A wonderful rural location with Bedford just 15 minutes away.
Our family was there for a funeral and Jan was so kind and considerate, making a tough time that much easier to bear."

Country life is something we aren't normally used to, but it was so nice and quiet out there. The farm provides some opportunities to explore, which we hope to on our next visit.

You will be greeted with warm hospitality and welcomed with fresh baked goods and so many amenities. The accommodations are lovely, the front porch so inviting with a wonderful, peaceful view. You will be ""off the beaten path"" but not far from shopping, sights and places to eat. This is a wonderful place to relax.

The sunny turret room was great, the included breakfasts were a wonderful start to the day, and Rowena was very warm and welcoming. We spent time relaxing on both the front porch and in the sitting room. Although Bedford is not a city we would have chosen to visit under regular circumstances, it became the perfect place for us to hang out and we even decided to view the eclipse from right there to avoid big crowds closer to the center of the path. Rowena opened up the gate to the vacant lot next door, which gave us the perfect view. We followed her tips on where to go on the free day before the eclipse and had a wonderful time and she even showed us around the jail attached to the B & B, which was fascinating. Rowena was the perfect host and her place added tremendously to our wonderful eclipse weekend."

Stayed one night","While looking for a place to stay for my class reunion, I came across this listing. As someone who grew up in Bedford I was intrigued by the fact that the former county jail was now a B&B. I knew right away this was the place for my husband & I as we are both retired law enforcement. Rowena was an exceptional hostess, greeting us at the door and immediately making us feel welcome. Our room, with an en suite, was on the second floor in the tower. There was a small refrigerator and coffee station located outside of our room. The rooms were tastefully decorated and clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Rowena communicated with us regarding our likes and dislikes for breakfast and had it on the table at the agreed upon time. After breakfast she gave us a tour of the old jail.
The house is located close to the Bedford square, food and shopping. Thank you Rowena for opening your home to us."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a gem! My husband and I were looking for a place to stay near the Bedford area as it was centrally located to all the state parks and forests we wanted to hike. I came across this Airbnb and thought it looked like a neat place to stay (who doesn't love a tower room?!). I am so glad we found it! Rowena and her Tower Room helped make our 7th anniversary trip extra special. The home-cooked and hot breakfasts were delicious and something we looked forward to each morning. They also kept us full until dinner time, allowing us to spend more time on the trails. The room was cozy and clean and we spent a happy afternoon there on the one rainy day we had, reading and resting. Rowena was an excellent communicator and made us feel at home from the start. We stayed Monday through Friday and wished it was for longer!"

We love to visit and catch up with Rowena when we sit down for her warm, homemade breakfasts! Her place is only 25 minutes south of campus, never any game day traffic driving into B-town. A hidden gem! Thank you again Rowena!

The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. We were able to hear the history and see some of the old jail which was intriguing. We would recommend this place 100%. It is right next to many downtown shops and more.

Stayed a few nights","I stayed five (5) nights in the Tower Room and I would have stayed longer if I did not have to get back to work. The room is bright and cheery. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is bright and new. The entire home is spotless. From the time you ascend the stairs on the street level and walk across the sidewalk to the front porch you feel like you are in a special place. This is confirmed when you enter the residence and see the beautiful old staircase that leads to the Tower Room. The location is a short walk to the town square with fun shops, restaurants and the Lawrence Count Museum of History. http://lawrencecountyhistory.org/ If you appreciate historic buildings then this is the place for you.
Rowena and her husband Reza are very interesting to talk to and their presence brings an added sense of security as they live onsite. They offer breakfast in a classic dining room or you can have a pot of coffee delivered to your room on a beautiful tray with antique cup, saucer, creamer and cookies. Very classy and a very fun experience. I highly recommend this Airbnb."

During the 1870s several characters from my book (“The Terror of Indiana: Bent Jones & The Moody-Tolliver Feud”) were frequent guests. The host, both career U.S. Foreign Service workers, have done a magnificent job of restoring the home. The Tower Room is larger than it appears in some photos and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. Most of all, their hospitality can’t be outmatched. Karen and I look forward to future visits."

There was hot drinks & snacks waiting for us that night, right outside of our tower room. The room and adjoining bathroom were exceptionally well-decorated, clean, and cozy with a very comfortable bed and down comforter. We enjoyed a FULL breakfast the next morning - breakfast casserole, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee, and juice - which was fantastic as well. After breakfast, Rowena graciously indulged our curiosity about the home's history, giving us a tour of the house and adjoining former county jail. We were thrilled to see what she and her husband have already restored in the home, and hear of her plans for the future. Overall, it was an exceptional visit in an equally unique home. We definitely hope to return, and highly recommend this place for those looking to stay overnight in the Bedford/Bloomington area. Thank you, Rowena!"

Stayed one night","My boyfriend and I stayed at Rowena's Midwestern castle during a weekend getaway in January 2015. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a better hostess. She was very accommodating without intruding in our weekend plans. She greeted us with a warm welcome and showed us to our very spacious room with attached bathroom. We were pleased with the drinks and the snacks made available to us in the mini refrigerator next to our room. We had access to the living room and used the space to watch a movie before going to bed. We enjoyed so much about this B&B but our favorite part of the trip included getting a tour of the old jail that is attached to the house. Learning the history of the house and the jail proved to be very interesting and Rowena was happy to share her knowledge on the place. The tour was great! She also let us explore her home and we were able to climb the ladder to the top of the tower. Her house and the view of Bedford from the tower are beautiful, and I suggest to request a tour of her home. Also, we LOVED the breakfast that was served. She catered to our dietary needs and fixed a vegetarian breakfast that we are still talking about a week later. It was delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone (and already have to a few people). The location is perfect for a quick trip to Bloomington, IN. We plan to visit again soon since we visit the area often. Our stay there was lovely."

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed at Rowena's B&B while visiting our daughter at IU Bloomington. We were welcomed with a friendly smile and the smell of homemade brownies, fresh out of the oven. We were given a tour of her beautiful home and then shown to our room on the second level. The room was plenty spacious with a large closet, dresser, and cozy desk and chair. We were also impressed to find a binder with all of the information and history of the home, that goes back to the late 1800's. After a freezing day outside tailgating, we were thrilled to change into our warm, cozy sweats, and enjoy college football on her large flatscreen tv in the private den on the main level. Rowena had previously asked my husband and I what we preferred for breakfast, which we replied we would be happy with anything. We woke up the next morning to the smell of a wonderful breakfast! Fresh cut fruit bowls, warm, homemade blueberry muffins, yogurt, a wonderful vegetable quiche, orange juice and coffee. Once finished with breakfast, we were given a tour of the Old County Bedford Jail, which is attached to the Old Sherrif's Home. (Rowena's House) We couldn't be more pleased with our decision to stay in Bedford, a quick 35 minute drive south of Bloomkngton, away from the hustle and bustle. We will most definitely be staying in Bedford again, in Rowena's beautiful Midwestern Castle! A home with a wonderful host!"
