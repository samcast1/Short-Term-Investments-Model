They responded in a timely fashion to my messages, and also accommodated me with an early check in which was much appreciated. Since the weather was nice, I was able to enjoy sitting on the front porch. The apartment is on a main street, so there is some road noise which is to be expected. It's a great value. I would definitely stay there again should I return to the Lima area."

Very homely, clean and spacious. Kitchen has all the needed amenities and more. Bathroom clean, with airconditioner. The tv-set is superb, and there's even a pingpong table.
Gillian is a great host, thoughtful and it never took more than a few minutes to respond to questions."

Stayed one night","Carina is a great host (along with handling store mgr. job) ... she was very timely responsive to texts- and on top of the little details about her listing ... which I've found might be missed by even responsible hosts- like needed bath towels, offering extras. The private side/back door brings you conveniently direct into the room, which has attached private half-bathroom. Bed is comfortable, all facilities were clean, shower in shared bathroom is top notch & easy to turn on. Carina was flexible on check-in time, important to me as I had to get in & get out to a ticketed event. Parking in her single car driveway aside the house was appreciated. Such a great value she offers here in a quiet Lima neighborhood."

Stayed a few nights","My girlfriend and I stayed at Carina's place over the weekend for a friend's wedding we were attending. I agree with the previous reviewer who said Carina's place is ""very homey"" - it's welcoming and relaxing. The room is large and spacious (even more spacious if you fold up the bed) with plenty of natural light, a couch & rocking chair, and doors that exit to the back porch. She had even more amenities than listed: there is a private entrance, as well as a fake fireplace space heater, and even toothbrushes/toothpaste if you forgot yours! There are two adorable cats: Casca will play and let you pet her as much as you want, and Smidge will shyly watch; there's a locking, folding door to the rest of the house if you want to keep them out. Carina was very responsive and flexible, and fun to chat with (while also playing with the cats). We'd definitely stay again!"

Having a separate entrance was convenient, to avoid inconveniencing the host or yourself. The room is split from the main property with a sliding door that locks, so you can opt for privacy or chat with the host and meet the cats. The value for the stay was great, and I would definitely choose to stop at this Airbnb again during another trip through the area."

my only issue was ceiling fan in master was loose so it made a ratling noise couldnt sleep with fan on. then it got hot so i moved to living room sofa, lol

Stayed a few nights","LuAnn was absolutely an amazing host for hosting me on such short notice. Her attention to detail and cleanliness of the space was spot on. She was very responsive and friendly!! A couple of things I want to mention about the space is that it did smell like cigarettes on the furniture and covers. I’m not a smoker at all and because I was sleeping underneath the covers my pajamas smelled like cigarettes. Another problem was the room door to my room did not close all the way and couldn’t be locked. I was not made aware that there was a man (an elder) staying near me and we would share the basement. The basement was where the washer and dryer was and because it was dark and kind of not welcoming, I was scared to go downstairs and wash my uniform. It is a mandatory 3 day stay which I didn’t know either (I only needed 2 nights) but because I needed a place to stay I took that caveat. Other than that, my stay was great."

Group trip","Overall the check in process was very easy, the house was clean, and has very comfortable beds. Very large TVs and comfortable furniture. The tub is deep with solid pressure.
The downside is around 11pm, the trains begin coming by every 30minutes so it was nearly impossible to sleep without ear plugs. The neighbors kept shooting off fireworks and doing burnouts around 2am.
Excellent size house if you have a large party and everyone wants their own room, but the neighborhood is rough and located near an active train tracks."

Stayed with kids","Julie is a wonderful communicator, and her home is beautifully restored, albeit on the inside. The neighborhood the home is located in is quite rough and although Julie’s accommodations are thoughtful, cozy, and comfortable, we had a hard time feeling like we were actually safe. There is a security camera, which helped put our minds at ease. I am giving Julie a 5 star rating because she is a gracious, fantastic host, but if I were looking for accommodations for a solo trip, I would look in a different part of the city or look at Julie’s other listings. But if you are coming with a group, this place is close to most of the restaurants, museums, and coffeeshops in the area. We had a great trip."

Stayed about a week","This house was not exactly what I was expecting, it's not your normal airbnb the breakfast part which I don't expect much but was completely missing .
The location is perfect for working in the main parts of town, I had a booth at the Fair and it was just 12 mins away. For myself and son coming home 9.30pm to 10pm every night it didn't feel very safe, although Julie has a great light over the parking area and tons of space for 3 vehicles if you so needed. This house would be great for a work team, the kitchen was well facilitated and the fridge freezer was Excellant we always had ice.
The beds were comfy although soft and the stairs to upstairs quite steep. The rooms were lacking in outlets, to be expected in an old house I had an extension lead but it was 3 pin and the outlets were 2 😞
If you want a good long soak in the bath this house has the bath, getting in and out not so easy. There's TV's in all rooms, the lounge TV is huge and the room is cozy."

Once we informed Julie, she took care of it the same day! If you need to stay in Lima (or close by) and don't have issues with narrow stairs to the bedrooms and bathroom, we'd highly recommend this home."

Keep in mind the only bathroom is upstairs (steep stairs) and is a claw foot tub, shower combo. Not ADA friendly. If that’s not an issue don’t hesitate to book!"

Tammi made for a great
warm farewell experience for me and my mom.
My mom came from overseas to attend my special day and was pleased to expirence living in an American country home with a big yard and pond.
No need to mention cleanliness, because the place was far beyond flawlessly clean. when you go there you will feel you’re in a combination of a hotel and your grandparents house. from the huge yard that includes ducks in their lake, swings, fireplace and flours beginning to bloom for the summer.
As far as to the room, the sheets seemed NEW and smelled floury. The room included many essentials from fridge, microwave, toaster and dishes. The only thing it was missing was a water boiler to make tea/coffee.
I encourage anybody who comes from a big city to go there and experience serenity and relax"

Tammy was super responsive to our messages and was extremely friendly! As we were packing up to head to the AirBnB, we asked if there would be a place for us to cook eggs in the morning. Tammy immediately told us she would put a portable cooktop in the room for us, and even asked if we would like some of their duck eggs.
We accidentally walked in the wrong door when we went to check in, and we were greeted by the sweetest dogs, and Tammy’s husband who was very kind and welcoming. The house was beautiful, our room was super cute, and we had more than everything we needed. Tammy and her husband really thought of everything!"

The home is immaculate, beautifully decorated, and equipped with everything you need. Every room was spotless, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. The living area was cozy and inviting.
Our host, Jan, made our stay exceptional. From the initial booking to our final goodbye, Jan was the epitome of hospitality. They went above and beyond providing local tips.
The location was ideal. It was the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle, yet still close to local attractions and amenities. We spent our days exploring parks and cafes and our evenings enjoying the tranquil backyard.
We couldn’t have asked for a better stay. This Airbnb home is a true gem, and Jan is the best host we’ve ever had. We can’t wait to come back."

Stayed with kids",We loved staying at Kenzi’s place! Wish we had time to enjoy the cute backyard and home but just needed to stay one night while visiting family. Home was cozy and would have everything we needed if we stayed longer. Would definitely stay again!

Stayed a few nights","My mom and I stayed in this house for several days while visiting from out of state.
I was looking for an airbnb where we could spend time visiting with my daughter and grand daughter.
Kenzie’s place was cozy and had everything we needed.
I used the WiFi for a few work zoom meetings no problem and there was a little work space in one of the bedrooms that made that easy.
We were a short drive from groceries and restaurants.
And we were easily able to bake a favorite apple cake (a wish my daughter shared before the trip).
Kenzi was quick with replies when I had a few questions and helped make everything work well.
All and all a quite comfortable spot to spend time while visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","The house is cute and intimate, located in a quiet neighborhood. The bathroom needs attention to detail to realize a clean finished look. Same for minor paint splatters in dining room and on dining room chair. There were 5-6 plug in air fresheners that were overwhelmingly odorous and chemically toxic. Even after being unplugged for 5 days the smell permeated the house.
If the above items were addressed, it would be a more ideal place to stay."

Worst part it the main bedroom has old carpeting in it and the whole home smells like it. Plus, it was 30 degrees outside, but the heat was turned way down and the door to the upstairs (which has no direct heat vents) was closed, so it was freezing and took a long time to warm up. I tried to be ok with everything, but picking up the remote and finding something brown and sticky was the last straw. Home is in a good location - close to downtown Lima, hospitals, and UNOK. Host was quick to reply and offer to cancel and refund."

Stayed with kids","Check in was easy. Everything was clean, comfortable and quiet. Full kitchen to cook the breakfast we brought. Plenty of space for 2-3 air mattresses if you have a large party."

Stayed with kids",Jason’s home was perfect to stay in to visit family and had everything to keep our toddler comfy and entertained! The home was clean and nicely stocked. We will definitely stay there again when in the area!

Stayed with kids","This stay was awesome for our trip to Lima!! It was literally a street from the movie theatre and Beer Barrel Pizza & Grill! The host was a great communicator and helped us navigate using the PS4. The beds were very comfy and the Window A/C unit kept the attic very cool during the warm days. Would absolutely book again for our next trip, I highly recommend!!"
