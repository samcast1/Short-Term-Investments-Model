Stayed a few nights","What a gem of an AirBNB! Perfect for two people!!
The cabin is such a cute little space that is fully set up to feel comfortable and at home. The host made us feel so welcome with a customized sign for us plus left us snacks, waters, coffee, and even provided half and half!
We have stayed at quite a few airbnbs across the country and Mexico, and honestly, these hosts need to win an award as best host. They went above and beyond in every manner. We stayed for almost a week working in Camden and just wish we could have enjoyed the front patio more.
If we ever need to come back to this neck of the woods, this will be our go-to. Thank you, Ronny!!!"

Stayed one night","Wow! This place is so nice, the pictures do not do it justice! It is meticulously clean, which we always appreciate! Ronny sent messages ahead of time and was always available if needed.
The place is in a nice, quiet neighborhood and off the street.
It was stocked with water, coffee, milk, even snacks!
We had such a nice stay, bed was super comfy, shower was wonderful and sparkling clean! Such cute decor, felt right at home!
If you don’t stay here when you are in Camden, you are missing out!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at several beautiful places and by far, this host was the most attentive and accommodating host I have ever experienced. He checked in with us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. He had tons of snacks left for us, a full stocked coffee bar and the cottage was soooooo cute and roomy. The price was less than the local hotels and way beyond our expectations. My daughter and son in law live in the neighborhood and we will be back many many times in the future. I highly recommend this location and will be sharing the information with everyone I know!! Close to El Dorado and even Magnolia and soooo worth the drive. Camden is really working on become a great little town with First Fridays and Food Truck Sunday plus cute little boutiques like The Perfects. Don't overlook this precious town and this cottage!!!"

I had to extend my stay for a week and was able to do so easily. Would book again if available."

Stayed a few nights","There are a lot of things that I really enjoyed about staying the two nights at this airbnb.
There were welcome snacks and two Sprites. Inside the nice large refrigerator there were several bottles of water, and the ice maker was very good. The kitchen had pretty granite countertops, a huge farm sink, a large five burn stove, a keurig with lots of k cups, every kind of pot needed for cooking, nice dishes, glasses, cups, several different kind of dry goods, salt and pepper, olive oil, etc.
The television was awesome and very easy to use. The key code was very easy to remember. There were many towels, hand towels, and wash cloths to use. They have large capacity washer and dryer, iron, ironing board, even laundry baskets. The plug for the internet was very near the bed which made it easy to use. The ceiling fans in most rooms were wonderful and the air conditioning was perfect. In the bathroom, they had cotton balls, q-tips, and name-brand shampoo and conditioner. It has a nice front porch and a small screened in back porch. The bathroom door is a barn door and even under the vanity there is a tiny barn door to open it. As you can tell, I really enjoyed my stay. And the host was wonderful. I could not have been more happy."

The only thing that could have been better was the grass was not cut other than that it was perfect. Large back yard and plenty of space on the inside. You you are a person that enjoys a tv in the bedroom, there is no tv in neither bedroom but that was ok for us."

The private sandy beach area was perfect for finding tadpoles, swimming and learning how to paddle a kayak. The kitchen was great for preparing meals while the kids played upstairs in the loft. The tree house was definitely a great place to kickstart the summer."

My family and I only had a one night stay, so we had to make the most of it, but the property is amazing! There is so much to do to keep your kids entertained and outdoors. I really enjoyed the lagoon next to the treehouse. Henry was very friendly and met us at the property to discuss the different sights located there and on our checkout day came and told us about some of the local sights we could catch on the way out. We definitely plan on a return visit with a longer stay next time."

Our two boys (7,3) had the best time exploring the grounds and crossing off items on the treasure map. We were able to actually relax on vacation, bird watch, read books, search for pirate ships, take paddle boat rides, operate a ferry, visit a fort, lay in the hammock and listen to the waterfall while watching wood peckers and cardinals. Absolute bliss."

He was quick to address small issues in the treehouse that we had not even noticed, and asked us repeatedly if we needed anything at all or if anything needed attention. The treehouse is MAGICAL. It is absolutely beautiful, set in the most incredible surroundings. We spent all morning exploring with our two boys, and they had the time of their lives. I can't recommend it enough! It is more expensive than a regular hotel, but I can tell you that this MADE our trip. It was absolutely worth the extra expense, and Henry could not have been a more welcoming and wonderful host. We can't wait to come back again!"

Our group of adventurous girls had a blast exploring the grounds, swimming in the lake, playing fetch with the pups, lounging in the hammocks, conquering fears of dark caves, rubbing the Buddha tummy, boarding a pirate ship, and hearing the constant calm of flowing water at night as we drifted to sleep in the treetops.
Inside, all the amenities you wouldn’t expect in the wilderness are here. That shower is everything! The nest up top was perfect for the kiddos and the private balcony perfect for reading. Oh and the sunset…can’t say enough good things about this place. Core memories for sure."

If you love being outdoors especially boys you will love this place. The treehouse itself was completely amazing. For you mommas who want to go but don’t want to play this is your place! You have everything you would want on a camping trip without the camper or tent! The activities were endless. We hiked, biked, kayaked, swam, explored… it was great fun. Henry was such a great host and we enjoyed our visit with him. The pictures DONT do this place justice. The freedom to explore was refreshing and the peaceful atmosphere was much needed. The talent and dream to bring this place to life is something that the Lord blessed this family with! Do it you won’t regret it!"

My children and I absolutely loved it at the Toucan Treehouse and we loved Mr. Henry! He is a very kind gentleman. We felt safe and protected our entire stay. The beds were comfortable and the house was cool. Everything we needed was there from kitchen utensils, cooking supplies, bathing, laundry, towels, pillows, extra blankets, games and books! Access to the movie channels was an added bonus. We loved having breakfast on the porch, relaxing on the hammocks, taking a boat ride on the lake, swimming in the beautiful pool, and of course exploring the hidden treasures on the property! Thank you, Henry, for opening your tropical jungle-like paradise up to the world and sharing this gem with us! We will definitely return for a much longer stay! Next time I hope it rains!"

It's paradise, it's beautiful, it's relaxing, it's impressive, it's welcoming, it's a place that takes you away from daily stress and you feel as if you are in a different world. We spent our Easter weekend here with our three kids (17, 15, 11) and they all loved it so much - there is something to explorer for anyone and no one is too old or too young for this place. None of us wanted to leave.
I would recommend this place to anyone (who is somewhat physically fit because those stairs going up to the tree house is a good work out, haha).

We enjoyed watching the sunset as our boys fished in the lake. They caught fish every few minutes and our oldest son caught a huge bass that was his all time biggest catch. The treehouse is extraordinary and we created memories that will last a lifetime. Henry is a wonderful host and we enjoyed our visit with him. He is funny and really welcomes you “home” with an overview of the property and makes sure that you are aware of the best places to explore. We are planning to come again and suggest that you stay at least two nights because there is just so much to see. Thank you Henry for taking such great care of us. Our treehouse adventure was such a dream come true.

Truly!!
We felt we traveled around the world without the work of airplane trips and taxi rides! We had it all and it wasn’t busy with tourists!
The precision to details along with the imagination placed into everything was wonderful!

We knew the 3 year old was a bit young for the property so we kept a very close eye on him with the water and bridges. My 8 year old was such a great age for this property! The grounds are the most unique, peaceful, and magical place we've stayed at. We hiked the grounds from the moment we arrived until the sun set, then again in the morning until we left the grounds. A must see for kids and adults that love to explore, love treehouses, and love pirates. We will most certainly be back! Also, the mountain biking in Arkadelphia and Hot Springs was fantastic as well so we did the Treehouse one night and on the prior day and following day we mountain biked and explored the city!"

We spent hours hiking the easy trails on the property and finding all of the highlights on the map. The treehouse is less than 10 minutes from the highway so it’s convenient to town as well.
Our favorites were the cave, trails, canoes, bridges, open space, fort, and of course the treehouse. The minute my kids saw a cargo lift to get their luggage up they felt like they were on an adventure. The water features were beautiful everywhere. We received rain and lightning while staying the night and it was a beautiful show. We were told there was a professionally installed lightning rod as well to protect us. Thanks Henry for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","The treehouse is well built; yes, if you watch outside markers through the windows you’ll see the treehouse does sway quite a bit. Which was a totally awesome feeling and experience, but never have we heard any buckling, crackling, or structural creaking the entire stay. Not even the floor creeks. Never felt any safety concern of any sort. The floor plan seemed symmetrical, was well thought out for all the comforts and amenities all the while spacious for a romantic couple or family trip. The interior decorating had eye catching items and views on the walls at every glance; while the nearly 180 degree view from the kitchen and clear view through the rest of the homes huge windows keeps your wonder both inside and out.
Fell in love with all the vegetation, especially bamboo throughout the grounds. The trails were clear, but I would suggest hiking boots. Enjoying everything this BnB has to offer is definitely worth at least a two nights stay. The host was very generous and flexible with the scheduled time of stay.
The WiFi and two TVs were in great working order. I loved the reclining master bedroom’s bed. However as a side sleeper I had a hard time sleeping the whole night because the bed or mattress has a bit of a dip where your tush is while you’re sleeping on your back.
The chairs in the general living area were pretty comfortable, sturdy, and easy to get out of.
We went in the winter so no matter of Arkansas big or tiny outside wildlife was an issue, however during the summer I think I’d wish for good bug lotion and screen doors. Was a bit too cold for a bonfire, but if ever we go back it’ll most likely be in the late end of autumn to definitely include that experience too."

Stayed with kids","Stop Looking and get Booking!!!!
Our greatest complaint is not having more time! We traveled with our three sons (14,12,9) for two nights. I don't know if you could dream up a more idealist place to stay. They didn't want to leave. Pictures can't capture how lovely the Treehouse is. There is literally days of things to explore. Every small detail is wrapped in love and intentional planning. Henry is in a Master Class level of hosts. Such a wonderful person.
Beds and linens are high quality and comfortable. The large bathroom is nicer than most 5 star resort/hotels I've stayed at. Kitchen is modern and has anything you could possibly need, plus more. There are two twin beds upstairs in the loft with a very nice air mattress that we actually put into the side closet/storage area. It was like its own special bunkroom! Massive.
We travel and stay at dozens of Air bnbs and I must say, this has been our most favorite experience in the US. If you have adventurous children, this is the dream. We watched swiss family Robinson the night before we got here and surprised our kids.
We WILL return, many times."

It's hard to snap pictures that give due praise to this amazing property. We arrived later than expected, and Henry and his dog were waiting for us. After a warm welcome, we quickly fell asleep listening to the water and wind going through the bamboo. In the morning after breakfast, we explored the grounds and realized we need much more time to discover all the finds on the treasure map. We hope to see you again soon, Henry. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Where do I begin?! You see the pictures and think its an awesome place, then as soon as you drive up and go into the treehouse you are even more amazed!! Everything is laid out perfectly! Small enough to be a treehouse, but roomy like you are not. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. Full sized refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, & microwave. Buy groceries and cook your food in the treehouse. You will want to spend much time high amongst the trees and listening to the peaceful waterfall down below. We ate several meals out on the lovely porch off the living room. Our 2 kids LOVED the loft bedroom which was perfect! My husband and I enjoyed the wonderful view to wake up to every morning from the master bedroom. Plenty of fluffy towels & linens were provided along with extra blankets, pillows, etc... The lake down from the treehouse is a haven for relaxing and having fun! The kids (and us adults too) enjoyed swinging on the swing out over the lake, as well as lounging in the hammocks, fishing and paddling the boat out. There was a wonderful breeze constantly blowing while at the lake which was so nice! You absolutely MUST walk all of the fantastic nature trails! We LOVED all the swinging bridges and hidden gems that Henry has built over the years! Walk the trails, slow down, take pictures, enjoy nature! UN-PLUG! RELAX! Henry was a treat as a host. He was so friendly, easy to communicate with, helpful, and accommodating! Thank you so very much Henry for sharing your wonderful, whimsical treehouse and grounds with us! It was a perfect family vacation get away that we needed! We even extended our stay another night once we got there we loved it so much! There are exactly 57 steps to the top so eat your wheaties before you go! HA! One thing to note which was absolutely not a problem for us, but the treehouse does ever so gently sway a tad. If anyone in your party has Extreme motion sickness it could possibly bother them? I personally have some motion sickness issues, but it did not bother me. I would recommend bringing groceries, stopping by Walmart to pickup cold groceries on the way in and cooking your meals at the treehouse. After all, isn't this fabulous treehouse WHY you came? To stay in it and have such a neat experience?! SO..... spend time ""in"" the treehouse! They have a grill and charcoal so we grilled out steaks one night! There is a firepit and wood so bring some marshmallows to roast! Also, I highly recommend hanging out in the hammocks downstairs by the waterfall. I took a 2 hour nap there that was wonderful and healing to the soul! We took 1 day and drove to the diamond mine to look for treasures. If you are staying several days I would recommend this, but if only for a few days then skip it and enjoy staying put! We planned our trip for over a year and we are SO glad to finally be able to book it and go! We will definitely be back! WONDERFUL FAMILY MEMORIES WERE MADE AT TOUCAN TREEHOUSE!!! Thanks again Henry and GOD BLESS!!!"

Mother Nature Decided to surround the treehouse with severe weather and Henry ensured we were safe by offering his home/cellar for us to wait out the storm. He was attentive and a very easy Host to communicate with. prompt, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Lots to do around the area such as mining for crystals, visiting Hot Springs and the Diamond crater mine. All about an hour in either direction. Walmart less than ten minutes away though Henry supplies many of the necessities. A wonderful trip!"

It was a destination of its own with a fun treehouse with great toucan decorations, and plenty to do. Would wake up and drink coffee on the patio or swing on hanging chairs off the master bedroom. Then walk on any number of trails with the dogs who had a field day off leash. Canoed, explored the camp, and went back to enjoy grilling and a campfire with s’mores, laying on the hammock and basically just relaxing. Would definitely recommend!"

This properly felt like we were transported somewhere in the Amazon forest and it truly it incredible. There are canoes, many hikes, pirate ships, lots of bamboo and exploring to do. You don’t need to leave the property at all during your stay and there’s lots to enjoy. I’d recommend a stay for at least two days to fully enjoy it. Loved the location because even though it was remote it was still close enough to groceries and lots of places to eat, which made it very easy after a long day of exploring.

Stayed with kids","Book Now! It is worth every penny and more. The accommodations are incredible and the scenery is unmatched. We had a full day to explore and know that we still didn't see it all. We would absolutely go back again and plan to next year. Henry is one of the best hosts I have experienced with airbnb and it was evident he loves being a host and sharing paradise with those who visit. As a parent, I have not felt like such a kid in 20 years and I have never heard so much laughter from our family. Truly a one of a kind experience, its like your own personal Jumanji...without all the scary parts! Although the stay is private and secluded, you are also 10 min to a Walmart. The AC works very well and the shower is FANTASTIC! Overall, it is hands down our favorite airbnb experience."

Stayed with kids","Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Had the pleasure of staying here with my wife, toddler, and chocolate lab while driving cross country. This was the perfect way to wind down after hours on the road, and to tire our pup and kid out before heading out the next day. This place feels like Neverland, and it was a magical place for our little family to explore. Henry was a fantastic host, and the room is sparkling clean with great views, books, and amenities. We'd definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for magic, you will find it here. We filled every minute of our three night stay with adventure: fishing in our private pond, hiking miles of beautifully maintained trails, letting our imaginations run wild while eating dinner on our balcony (next to our waterfall) in the treetops and roasting s’mores over a campfire. The home was immaculately clean and well stocked. The kids loved scheming in their own private loft. We brought crystals, gold doubloons, fools gold and arrowheads to hide and find during our adventures around the property.
Camp was in session while we were there, but we still felt as if the whole place was to ourselves. When we did run into campers, the campers and counselors were gracious and helpful (and inspired my 8 year old to consider camp next year). We were on the tail end of our 2 week trip through Arkansas, and Henry generously offered a swim in his own private pool. It doesn’t get any better than that.
It’s abundantly clear that Henry has built this slice of heaven to inspire creativity and calm. It’s been a labor of love, and he has well surpassed that mark!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are reading this and wondering about booking, DO IT! The Toucan Treehouse is everything the pictures show and more. Endless opportunities to explore the trails and find the many treasures including the tepees, pirate ships, etc. Walking through the bamboo lined trails is magical. We enjoyed walking over the many bridges, kayaking the lagoon, and swimming at the lake. Life jackets, kayaks, beach chairs are all provided. The Treehouse is equipped with everything you need inside as well. We enjoyed meal time on the balcony and watching the birds. Quiet time in the hammocks was peaceful. We loved our visits from the doodles. Our dogs also enjoyed the freedom to explore and play. Our time was magical and memorable and we definitely will be back. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","By far one of the best experiences we have ever had, it far exceeded anything we could have expected and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a little getaway! It is like a little slice of paradise that you get to have all to yourself. The treehouse itself is awesome and getting to stay in it is a unique experience that you won’t regret! Mr. Henry is an excellent host, he is very friendly and has thought of every little detail to make your trip absolutely perfect! The adventures alone are priceless. Take one of the numerous trails and not only experience the beauty of nature, but they also lead to fun areas to explore. We played on pirate ships, pretended to be soldiers protecting the gold at Fort Crown Point, went on a treasure hunt and found some in Blackbeard’s cave, and even discovered arrow heads at the Native American village (I planned ahead and brought pirate treasure for the cave, arrowheads for the village, and chocolate gold coins for the fort). We made s’mores over a campfire, and although we didn’t get a chance to utilize all the water activities, there are boats, kayaks, and canoes available for you to use (life jackets are even provided), there are plenty of fishing spots, a small sandy beach with swimming area right behind the treehouse, and if you take the short hike to the other swimming area, there is an obstacle course area (over the water) with ropes and swings and a big inflatable blob. There is so much to do (more than I can list here) you don’t need to leave the site to find entertainment. Everything you need is provided, except bug spray-which it’s in the woods, so you’ll need some and food (sugar, salt, pepper, oil, condiments, coffee, laundry and dish detergent, shampoo and conditioner, soap, and other basics are there for your use). We plan to make this a yearly trip."

Stayed a few nights","Toucan Treehouse is such a unique and amazing experience! I say experience because it is so much more than just a place to stay. The treehouse was perfect for a family of four. My boys are adults and still fit comfortably in the loft upstairs. The place had everything we needed to stay comfortably. The views of the lake from the treehouse were beautiful, especially from sunset. All of the trails, lakes, lagoons, and activities kept us so busy! We were like little kids going on an adventure. Henry and Austin were super friendly, accommodating and helpful. It’s very secluded but also close to Caddo Valley so you can grab supplies and gas. DeGray Lake is just minutes down the road and is a great place to visit on your trip. We will be back!"

This place truly makes you feel like a kid again and if you have kids or fur babies it’s an absolute paradise! The trails were phenomenal, if you don’t get turned around like we did. Make sure you take your walking/hiking shoes. The landscape and property is simply breathtaking! This is truly a one of a kind experience that is worth every penny although I was reluctant to stay at first because of the price but once the owner assured me that it would be worth it, I knew we had struck gold the first day when we arrived. Forever in my memories and we will be be back hopefully sooner than later for round 2!!!"

Stayed one night","We had such a wonderful with our family on a much needed getaway. We appreciate your hospitality, Henry. You and your family have such an amazing place! The property grounds can not be fully described in words or pictures, you must just see it ALL! Absolutely amazing. You will be wowed from the very beginning of driving down the driveway! The attention to detail in not only the treehouse but the entire property is like nothing I have ever seen before. You feel like you are on an island some place tropical mixed with the very best of Arkansas natural setting. Our family stayed the night January with temps in the 50's. Our 2 boys who are 10 and 12 just loved it all. We hiked all over. We felt like we went on an amazing adventure discovering new areas of the property that Henry and his family put so much thought into developing. The treehouse itself sits in a private setting overlooking a private lake. The treehouse was very comfortable! The shower was delightful! Great space under the treehouse for relaxing! The attention to detail was shocking and much appreciated! We love taking road trips as a family and this place made the very top of our list of favorite stays! Henry was so kind to our family. You couldn't ask for a better host! Thanks again for everything, Henry! If you are reading this considering visiting, I say DO IT and make sure you go exploring the property!!"

There are lots of trails to explore around the grounds, and it’s close enough to Arkadelphia to run to the store if you need anything. Henry is an excellent host who helped show us around when we first arrived, and the treehouse has all the basics you need for dining in the house. It was perfect for my husband and I to get away for the weekend, but it would also be a really fun location to bring kids!"

The river is quite a drop down from the cabin. Which we couldn’t tell from listing photos. Several steep metal stairs to get to the bottom to fish or explore. Other than that the pictures portray the property very well. Would recommend to friends and family for a great cabin stay.

Group trip","I cannot say enough good things about our stay! The location is perfect, literally ON the River, fantastic views from inside the house and the porch and bedroom. Peaceful setting immersed in nature feels so private. Internet was great and strong - boys even played Xbox streaming and had no issues! We brought our Apple TV with us which worked great!
There is a volleyball/badminton net, cornhole and a fire pit riverside which looked amazing but it rained most of the weekend so we didn’t get to use but would love to if we return!
House stays a little smoky from the amazing fireplace but it didn’t bother us! The screened in back porch is incredible and private and has a super cute daybed that my girls loved!
Walmart is an easy 12 min drive into town, and Dollar General is even closer in a pinch. Hot springs is about 30-40 min depending on where you are heading. Highly recommend Garvan Woodland Gardens year round - if you go during late Nov/Dec they will likely have the Holiday Lights going 4-9pm - get tickets ahead of time they sell out but HIGHLY worth it. Also hike at Lake Catherine - gorgeous spot!
We loved our morning coffee ritual on the porch overlooking the River, and the rustic cabin vibe was perfect. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

I if can’t buy it, I will be back to visit many times! I would say the cleaning fee is a bit much. It was over $200 for the cleaning fee and it is asked and expected to leave the house spotless. Which I did. But I would stay more often if the price didn’t almost double for the stay due to that high fee."

Stayed with kids","My family and I come to this area of Arkansas once or twice a year to visit family. This is, by far, the nicest place we've ever stayed around there. The cabin is spacious and fantastic. It had all the amenities we could ask for and more (horse shoe pit, tetherball pole, darts, pool table, cards, puzzles, board games, bubbles for the kids, a pit boss smoker for the adultier kids). It had more than enough sleeping space for everyone and had enough space and seating that we could have invited our whole extended family out to relax and visit for a while.
My kids loved the nature surrounding the cabin. They watched fireflies from the porches, counted stars from the deck overlooking the river, and we even got to watch a red fox come up from the river and meander back into the woods.
We definitely look forward to booking this cabin again in the future.
**My only word of caution for future renters is something that I had to remind my children several times. We're in a cabin out in the woods, overlooking a beautiful river. There will be bugs. We had several dirt daubers make it into the cabin, saw a couple of spiders, and had some moths and flying insects that would surround our bedside lamps at night. This was not a problem for us, because it's to be expected in a setting like this. I just wanted to include the caution in the event some people just really don't like bugs."

The water located just outside the cabin is accessible, but not really good for wading/playing. Found a few fishhooks and the sand is like sinking sand! We also got bit by lots of chiggers, but all in all a very small price to pay for the fun we had! We will definitely be coming back!"

Stayed with kids","I have been renting condos for many years, there are some that are just diamonds and this is one. We were in town visiting my student athlete and this is the perfect home for that. We were able to walk to the OBU pool, the football stadium is even closer. If you're visiting a Henderson student it is an even closer walk to their stadium, tennis courts , and pool. For me it was amazing to be .25 miles or less from Feaster Trail, a gorgeous walking/running trail that goes through Arkadelphia.
The home itself is just gorgeous and perfectly appointed, everything is in the kitchen that we needed and the table was perfect for the family dinner we had. The towels in the bathrooms are the softest I've felt in an ABnB and the beds were super comfy too. My son is a freshman and we will definitely be staying here again!"

Stayed with kids","Melissa was a very responsive host and you can tell that she spent some time decorating her place to match the “blast from the past” theme. Cool, retro, and campy. The bathrooms were beautiful and we loved the mirror that lit up when you touched it! The towels were comfy and soft. There was a well stocked kitchen to fit all of your needs. Our kids loved that there was a TV in every room as we won’t allow them to have a TV in their rooms at home so they thought this was pretty neat! The location was the perfect distance between Hot Springs and the Crater of Diamonds which is what we were looking for. The house was in a neighborhood that is not quite what we were anticipating as far as walking around, but I believe that it looks like it is up and coming! We definitely recommend it!"

Group trip","1st off, Janice is a very bubbly and welcoming host! She is very communicative and is always ready to help. The home was way more spacious than I expected, I found myself frequently staring at the living room in awe of how large it is. There’s tons of sitting room and the place just feels ‘homey’. The antique nature of the home, plus Miss Janice’s unique taste in interior design gives the home a refreshing air of mystery. It is the perfect place for a mens retreat. I even wrote my vows for my wedding in the office study.
The only real “drawback” for the home, is that it wasn’t built with more bedrooms. The place feels like it wants to hold minimum 8-9 people comfortably.
My stay here will be etched in my memories forever, my wedding weekend would not have been what it was without this home. Thank you Miss Janice, for your kindness and hospitality!"

The lawn is extra large, too. Our dog enjoyed his daily outings. We enjoyed sitting on the porch listening to the birds and watching the squirrels (so did our dog). Janice was a wonderful host - she brought breakfast goodies at check-in (she came to meet us and show us around the house) and even shared a watermelon with us! She is such a generous and friendly person. Meeting her was such a treat and it made us feel like we really were staying in ""her"" home."

Stayed a few nights","This home is a beautiful Midcentury modern jewel in El Dorado, AR. It is huge inside and open. There are 2 full beautiful bathrooms and 1/2 baths. The den is huge and seats at least 16 people I would guess. There’s also a very cool outdoor deck the length of the back of the house. There are 4 lovely bedrooms and and an office. There are two beautiful Midcentury dining room tables that 6-8 and a kitchen breakfast area. Upscale kitchen appliances including a chef’s dream induction cooktop. This is just a stunning home and I would rent it again just to study the beautiful architecture of the home and the artwork inside.
The grounds are beautiful too.
A 2 car carport and fantastic privacy on a street that has one way in. One of the loveliest in El Dorado.
The description doesn’t do the house justice!
Janice is an incredible host and a wealth of knowledge about the home and town.

It was easy to find and Janice met us there to go over everything and was just a message away if needed.

Stayed a few nights","We had a loss in the family and wanted a place to stay that was more accommodating than a hotel. This place was a dream!
The details of the home are amazing! There is a piano we played church hymns on. So much room. We were so comfortable and in 60plus years of coming to my mother's home town, we've NEVER been this at home!!! We did not want to leave!
I've never rented a home where I did not need to bring any essentials. Given the reason we were here, we didn't pack very well. This host and home provided everything we needed. It is sooooo quiet. We needed that! The floor was so smooth and cold on the bottom of our feet. We actually kicked off our house shoes to enjoy it! There are different types of lighting everywhere. The house is so big you can section it off with lights and have your personal time while the family sleeps. The bathtub recesses into the floor with a slight slant for soaking. My Favorite! This home also provided a handicap accessible shower!!!! A God Send for my father-in-law. There are so many toilets.....no waiting! The fireplace sitting area is a dream. The iron work radiates beauty. The kitchen has a soundproof ceiling!!!! I found a 100 year old Sears and Roebuck Catalog Book! We looked and admired the photos from when the home was built. You can see the proudness in the families eye's and what a lovely family. The sliding doors to the outside are smooth and quiet. The backyard is absolutely stunning! Just sit and watch. You have your own live nature show! Hummingbirds, woodpeckers, deer! The host, Ms. Janice, made sure my family was comfortable. She stayed in contact with me. She even phoned to make sure my elderly father in law was doing ok within the home. She truly cares. There is also a lower bed for which my father used due to knee surgery, he had no problem getting in and out of bed nor to the restroom. You feel so safe while you are there. We are in love with this home and we will definitely be coming back! Thank you Janice for everything! We really were at home.

The kitchen had all the necessities plus coffee pods, creamer, extra trash bags, paper towels, dish soap, etc. The bathroom was stocked with all necessities as well.
Main bedroom was perfect. The bed was so comfortable we had to ask the hostess where the mattress was purchased!
Heather was wonderful and brought fresh eggs from the free roaming chickens which we accidentally left there! :(
The fenced area is the back was perfect for our 4 month old puppy and there were extra towels labeled for the dogs! Such thoughtfulness!
The living room window unit was loud but it did a terrific job of keeping us cool in the 90 degree weather!
This is a great option for people with family in the area. And it was the perfect place to decide if we could ever move the country and homestead! Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","This little spot is great if you’re looking for a weekend getaway or just need a place to stay while at work like I did! Winter weather rolled in and the commute to and from work just didn’t make sense! The cabin was clean, comfortable, and the hosts made a generator available when we lost power! Gas heat and cook stove so between that and the generator you’d never know we were going through an ice storm. Can’t say enough about these wonderful folks and their beautiful property!"

Group trip","Mathias' home was immaculate. So serene and beautiful outside and inside had all the amenities we needed and some we didn't expect. The bedding and mattresses were comfortable and we all slept great! The pool table, lighted Bluetooth speaker and cornhole kept us entertained.
The motion sectional in the den was comfortable and had us all thinking about replacing our own furniture!
The eat in kitchen is beautiful with bankette seating, modern white cabinets and all of the utensils and cookware needed to make any meal which was great, because we really didn't want to eat fast food the whole weekend. It was located close enough to Walmart to get supplies but tucked away enough to not be able to telll you were close, if that makes sense.
This was worth every dime of the price if you enjoy privacy and don't want to stay in a cramped hotel with a bunch of strangers at every turn.
Definitely the best choice when you come to Camden!"

The weather was very chilly when we arrived and when we walked in the home was nice and warm . Mathias had sent the code to us well in advance, so we were able to come right in. The photos and description truly do not do it justice.
This house is very spacious and well appointed. This home is sitting on a pristine partial of land in a beautiful safe neighborhood. There is a large play scape in the backyard that is awesome. The young family members, played pool out in the garage, which actually had a tiled floor. It was nice to be able to store all of our golf clubs out there as well. We came to this area to spend time with family for Thanksgiving in Bearden and to play golf. My niece and I were able to baked pies and casseroles in the awesome kitchen. Also want to mention that the beds are really comfy! We’ll be back!"

It felt more like we were seeing family rather than staying in an Airbnb. When we arrived, Missy and Michael had a fire going in the fire pit and we got to hear some of their amazing stories. When they heard it was going to be my mom’s birthday, they did not hesitate to give her a bottle of Prosecco as a gift. The guesthouse is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, and they have thought of everything one might need during their stay here. There was lots of wildlife to watch, and the view of the Ouachita river is spectacular. We got to use their hot tub (words can’t express how fantastic it was) and their sweet cat Tilly came to visit us. I also used the jacuzzi bathtub and became a bath person. The best part of all is that my mom said she had a relaxing weekend free from stress and anxiety. I highly recommend!!"

I figured it was on the same property but not that there was a bridge between the two. It was a non-issue but probably should be mentioned. The hot tub was really nice after a day of hiking around hot springs. We took the kayaks out too that was nice. It was just so beautiful and far enough away from town to be exactly the peaceful weekend we were hoping for. Would totally recommend to anyone that loves to get lost in the beauty of nature

They've provided great amenities! There's amazing bathroom supplies, a wide array of great kitchen tools, firewood, & just ask if there's anything you need! This treehouse has a super comfy bed, awesome shower/tub, great wifi, & amazing outdoor views & fun! We grilled, played horseshoes, sat around the fire, roasted marshmallows, star gazed, & enjoyed the hot tub! There's nothing like enjoying your morning coffee or evening beer while in a hot tub 10 feet away from a river & beautiful scenery! It's such a peaceful, relaxing place to recharge & I can't recommend this wonderful place enough! We'll definitely be back next year! Thank you for sharing your beautiful place w/ us!

Stayed a few nights","I was working in the area and needed a place to stay for a few days while my RV was repaired. This place wildly exceeded my expectations. It is close to town but somewhat off the beaten path. I was working from sun up to sun down so I did not get to enjoy the river or the hot tub, but the peaceful location and nicely appointed apartment made for an enjoyable stay. The hosts are great. They are friendly and attentive but not intrusive. If you need lodging in Arkadelphia this place should be your first choice....I think it would make for a nice romantic getaway that won't break the bank"

Stayed with kids","Wow , where to start... This place has it all and more. The place is absolutely beautiful! The pictures do this place no justice. Missy and Michael are absolutely amazing, extremely friendly and VERY accommodating. They went above and beyond to make sure we had anything and everything we needed. It was my mother's 60 birthday and this was my gift for her and when we arrived at the Treehouse, there was a beautiful birthday cake waiting for her when we arrived. That was the nicest hottub I had ever been in and the outside kitchen was awesome. We enjoyed every minute of it , oh and the bathroom in the tree house is to die for. Everything was well above any expectation. Honestly the Best Air B n B I've been to yet ! I will definitely be back , we are already checking dates to see when we can come back. You won't find a nicer host any where!!! Thank you so very much for making our time with you amazing 😍😍😍"

Awesome hot tub and large soaker tub in bathroom. Bed is EXTREMELY comfortable! Hosts are incredible and go out of their way to ensure you have what you need! Super peaceful and such a fun getaway! This is the BEST Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at.
