Stayed a few nights","Linda’s place was comfortable, & had many extra surprises you do not find many places— a goodie basket & wine, s’mores kit & movie snack pack. Also in the bathroom were many toiletries— just in case you forgot something. Did not get to use the hot tub due to too many places to go & not enough time. Burgess, Rock Island, Falls creek falls & Old Stone Fort State Parks were very convenient from the cabin & the waterfalls were amazing!"

Stayed a few nights",The rental was perfect. It was the best stocked Airbnb I have stayed in. Linda has thought of every thing you might need. Bed was so comfy and hot tub was awesome after hiking Mammoth March at Fall Creek Falls. The drive to Fall Creek Falls was less than 30 minutes and easy to get to. Also Rock Island State Park is near by. Also loved the rockers on the front porch and the nice fire pit.

My husband and I loved the peaceful and quiet of the property, the porches are a perfect place to have your morning coffee. The extras Linda put out was a cute touch, the movie night bucket and the smores bucket that you can use around the firepit."

Her home was very clean, plenty of towels, fully stocked kitchen, a personalized note, a bunch of goodies and treats for us. We had a great time celebrating our anniversary and a birthday! We hiked all day Saturday so the hot tub was wonderful and the fire pit afterwards made the night! Just a wonderful home! Thank you, Linda!"

Stayed a few nights","The Inn Between was just amazing! It was beyond what we expected..location was just outside of town and easy to get in and out of. If weather was warmer we would've spent more time outside on the decks and at the fire pit, but was a bit chilly and we went out exploring most of the day... Highly recommend this place if you want some peace and quiet..in a clean, cozy home. Loved it and hope to be back some day!!"

Stayed a few nights","Trying to put into words how wonderful this place is will be very hard to do. The pictures do not serve this place justice at all. Linda made the place to feel very at home. Not only do you feel welcomed at home but it was the small details that made her place stand out. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us, not to mention different variety of wine to share among our stay. She had a movie night bucket, a s’mores bucket and a snack basket as well, not to mention so many different types of soft drinks & coffees. This house was full acclimated with everything you might ever think you could need on a vacation, even down to birthday candles! The hot tub even had fancy smell goods to put in it if you would like. We didn’t have to leave if we didn’t want to. The bathroom had accommodations for items one might forget! We can’t thank Linda enough for opening up such a beautiful warming home to us. We hope to be back sooner then later! I wish I could rate over 5 stars because it’s deserve!"

Stayed about a week","Selected Linda's cabin for the setting and how cozy it looked inside. Linda's place was everything we hoped it to be and more. We enjoyed every afternoon on the porch listening to cicada's, seeing cardinal's & enjoying a Southern shower with lightening & thunder storms. We stayed at Linda's cabin for 7 nights and I wish we had booked our whole trip there instead of the few nights we had in Nashville. The location was perfect for taking 30 - 60 mile day trips from and just knowing we were returning to what felt like our home away from home made everything that much more enjoyable and comfortable. Thank you Linda for being so kind and thoughtful and making our 25th wedding anniversary very special! We loved your peaceful place -thank you for opening your home to us! Jerry & Gina"

Linda goes out of her way to make your stay as comfortable as possible, providing snacks and refreshments, lots of towels, etc. It was so well prepared that I almost felt bad disturbing it. The Inn is pristine, and totally worthwhile. The single, very small caveat is that while there is WiFi, it was pretty slow for my wife and I. This was fine for us, but may be something to be aware of depending on your needs."

Stayed one night","If you are reading this, you must be considering staying here. Let me tell you now, this is the single best Air B&B I have ever stayed in!
I travel a lot and have stayed in Air B&Bs all over the United States. This cabin stay was the coolest and nicest place I have ever stayed in. My only trouble was changing the volume on the TV when I was watching from the HotTub! Hahaha.
The price point is an incredible value. In Colorado or anywhere out west this would have cost me north of $500. I am from Woodbury, and I plan to stay here for days on end when I come visit the family.
There were wines, snacks, coffees, a fully stocked bathroom, salts for the hottub, grill, great bed! IT HAD EVERYTHING, I COULD LIVE THERE FOREVER!
Thank you so much!"

Group trip","It was lovely. The listing doesn't adequately describe how peaceful the front porch was. You can enjoy your morning coffee from one of the rocking chairs while listening to more birds than you've ever heard. The only traffic I saw was one man on a bike and a school bus. The home has everything you need for a cozy stay. It is an older building, a farm house as you'd expect. Some of the floors are not perfectly level but to us that just added to the charm. I loved it so much that I'll be looking for another excuse to visit McMinnville just to stay there again."

There is not a bad view from any place on the property. The family and I enjoyed walking across the way to the trail and spring house. Listening to the cows each morning and watching the sunrise was just perfection. The sunsets were beautiful as well. You can tell Luke puts in much love to their farm in McMinnville. We look forward to staying again! Thank you Luke and Patterson family for opening your beautiful home to us.

Great opportunity to climb on round hay bales if you’ve never done it or if you want to do it again. The only restroom is in the master bedroom . Great for a family trip. Hiking nearby and close enough to several state parks. I would definitely stay here again.

The home was clean, the furniture was comfortable, and the surrounding area was very peaceful. We often visit our friends and will most definately rent here again. Thank you to our host, Luke."

We took early morning walks enjoying the views. The location was private and relaxing. The kids loved the wide open yard. The Easter bunny found lots of good hiding spots for the eggs and the kids ran and giggled and scream with joy!! Evenings were spent relaxing on the covered porch in the rocking chairs. Then we went inside to play games. There were 3 tvs in the house but we never even turned a tv on since we were on the go and simply enjoyed being together talking, interacting, playing cards and jenga that was provided. It was too windy for a fire in the fire pit but the set up was perfect for having a fire. The view, the wood, the chairs, and the s’more stuff was all readily available. Will definitely return to Luke’s farm next time we are passing through. Thanks for sharing your home!"

There are many nice restaurants in town. We had dinner at Collins River BBQ one night and Chabelita’s another night. Both were delicious! It was nice having the golf cart to tour the farm. We also used the fire pit and made s’mores. Our dogs loved it too! So much land for them to walk around and explore. The place was very clean and homey and George was a great host!

Stayed about a week","Such a beautiful property! I was fortunate to find Judy and George’s property available last minute for our family vacation.
The tree farm is large and beautiful with many birds and butterflies flying about. You may hear a mockingbird sing through the night. We also saw deer most every evening. It is a working farm, so you will see a couple workers tending to the trees and driving through the farm. They were not a bother to us, as we were not to them. A friendly wave and a smile then we all continued on our way.
The farmhouse was clean and very spacious for my wife and I along with our two teens and two dogs. There is fast WiFi and a large television that we were able to stream movies on. We enjoyed taking the golf cart down to the river bank and explore. Evenings were spent having a campfire and eating s’mores.
As for the area, it was perfect for what we wanted to do. Cumberland Caverns is literally just down the road. Ruby Falls and Rock City is just over an hour drive to Chattanooga. The drive to Chattanooga was beautiful as it takes you through the mountains and has some breathtaking views. We also went to the Jack Daniels and Nearest Greene distilleries which were also just over an hour away.
George was helpful and answered any questions we had in a timely manner. Especially the one which my wife asked wanting to know what type of tree sits in front of the farmhouse.
If you’re looking to get away and want to unplug in a peaceful setting, Judy and George’s place is highly recommended!"

This place DEFINITELY has amazing views and land. My boys especially loved playing hide and seek in the Christmas trees and riding around in the golf cart with us.
The house was clean and comfortable if in need of a bit of TLC.
The kitchen had most of what we needed but I was glad to have my own chefs knife and kitchen towels and ziplocks. The kitchen table was a nice size for board games and card games.

Stayed over a week","George and Judy’s farm was more perfect than we could have imagined. We needed some respite from 2020 as we studied for the bar exam, so we decided to do a month-long stay here to focus and be by ourselves in a place with a lot of green and not a lot of people. We had a fantastic time. Our days consisted of running with our dog and playing fetch among the vast acreage, golf cart rides admiring the crops and the sunsets, grilling our dinner before dark and then talking by the fire, and of course lots and lots of studying. The farm provided a much needed reset as we geared up for what would be one of the most important exams of our lives. We could not have had better hospitality and hope to come again another time."

Stayed a few nights","We had such an incredible time at Judy & George's place. My husband and I (along with our lab-mix) met my parents, who were traveling from Texas, at the tree farm for a little COVID-friendly vacation. The place was very easy to find and absolutely beautiful. Our dog loved running around the tree farm and chasing butterflies, and we all enjoyed walking the property and attempting to fish down by the river. We did rent kayaks one days for a 3 hour kayak down the Collins River which is something I'd definitely recommend. If you have any questions or problems, George is incredibly responsive and very friendly - one of the best AirBnB hosts I've had in that regard. Overall if you, like us, are looking for a quiet, clean, and pretty place to relax for a few days and escape, this is perfect.
Some more detail: the accommodations are exactly as pictured and VERY clean. The entire place is very cute and perfect for a family vacation. The rooms are well appointed, beds are comfortable, and the A/C worked amazingly through several VERY hot days. The internet was very good and we were able to stream several live baseball games, which are often a test of streaming capacity, without issue. The living room in particular is very comfortable and has plenty of seats and is where we spent most of our time. We also found the dining room table, which is quite large, perfect for board games. I luckily did not need to work while there, but if something had come up I would have been fine (as noted, the internet was great and for calls, I have Verizon; service is slightly more limited for AT&T).
We cooked all of our meals during our stay, and found the kitchen basic, but sufficient. The fridge and freezer are roomy and work well, and the kitchen is well stocked with dishes, cups, and silverware. There are two cutting boards. Some packing tips for future guests: if you are planning on cooking anything complex or have a recipe that needs precise measurements (such as baking), I would recommend packing measuring cups/spoons - there are not a whole lot of those (at least that we could find). You might also consider packing a good cutting knife and/or some of your own pots and/or pans if you are particular about those; the ones at the AirBnB work ok, but are a little on the dated side.
Like I said above, overall we really enjoyed our stay. The farm is beautiful and the hosts couldn't be nicer. Thanks again Judy & George!"

We enjoyed coffee on the back porch and loved exploring the property. The river runs directly in front of the house- a quick stroll to get there. We bought smores for a bonfire in the fire pit but unfortunately there was rain in the evenings. The farm house is minutes away from the Cumberland Caverns. We enjoyed a awesome tour for $20 a person. The farm house is also close to Rock Island. We loved hiking there and enjoying the sandbeach at Rock Island. We were really happy we brought our kayaks! If future visitors bring kayaks my suggestion is to take them out at Rock Island swim beach- when you launch at the boat ramp head to the right and you will run right info beautiful waterfalls. We can not wait to come back and stay here again! See you again soon!

Stayed with kids","The highlight of the trip is the beautiful outdoor scenery and plenty of room to explore. The farm is in a secluded spot with mountains and ridges all around and the river a little over a hundred yards from the house. We spent most of the day kayaking and fishing. The fire pit is also a nice spot and good for stargazing on a clear night. The golf cart was a hit with our kids and made it easy to zip down to the river or explore the rest of the property. The actual house isn't luxurious by any means, but it was a clean and comfortable place to have a meal and get some rest after a long day outdoors. I'd recommend The Getaway for any family or friends looking for a good time together outdoors.
George was a good host and checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. We hope to come back sometime soon."

The house had everything that we needed, the beds were comfortable and clean and the kitchen was fully furnished. The farm itself is rather large with a mountain view and in close proximity to Falls Creek Falls National park the Cumberland Caverns, Rock Island, etc. George was very kind and allowed us to check out past the standard check-out time. Thank you George and Judy for the wonderful place!"

Stayed with kids","What a wonderful place to take the kiddos for a breath of fresh air, nature and a simpler existence! Our 4 kiddos (and one 4-legged kiddo) LOVED roaming the grounds gathering sticks to make a fire for smores, throwing rocks into the river and playing all sorts of games you can't in the city or suburbs. The grounds were so lovely, kept clean and mowed , it was sheer pleasure to walk among the trees. The location is not two minutes from Cumberland Caverns, which is an experience in itself. The home was very clean, stocked with all we needed for a simple Thanksgiving family meal. The rooms were very comfortable, and the entire home was easy to navigate, and my favorite was the kitchen and its glorious morning sunrise view. If you have kids having fun on the grounds, they can be easily seen from the back porch. The fire pit made for a great evening of smores-- and they even stocked it with wood. At the end, the kids didn't want to leave, because they felt happily free to roam and roll down hills and get dirty (having the washing machine and stocked detergent helps with that!). Our cell phone reception was spotty in the whole area, but connecting to the home wifi gave us the ability to make web calls and videos-- but that was about it for devices-- we spent most time outside! Oh, and having use of the golf cart was a treat for parents and kids alike! We look forward to visiting again!"

We were excited to find metal hotdog/marshmallow roasting sticks in one of the kitchen drawers, for example. We loved long walks during our stay, as well as a meal downtown, and a trip to the Cumberland Caves. While there at the house, we enjoyed family time playing games, eating, and watching movies, while also having the space to do our own things at times, such as work on a puzzle (one person in the kitchen), driving the golf cart, walking the dog, taking a nap, fixing food, or reading a book. We hope to return in the future."

It is stocked with all the basic kitchen essentials and a charcoal grill. And if you need something, town is close by.
Cumberland caverns is across the main road with underground andventures and The Cavern music venue is a seemingly short and scenic 40-45 minutes away.

The house is on the most beautiful property, surrounded by beautiful trees, including dogwood. There is river access and they let us drive the golf cart around the farm, which was thrilling to my 4 year old son. We can't wait to go back and experience the property during all 4 seasons."

Stayed a few nights","George & Judy's home is wonderful. The home itself is updated, spacious, and secluded. My family and I had the most relaxing weekend. The home feels like it's a country side farmhouse although it's only 15 minutes to town. It's also very close to Cumberland Caverns - the drive can't be more than 5 minutes. We booked the place bc we were in town for a wedding, but ended up having more of a vacation getaway! I am a regular Airbnb'r and have to say this has been one of my favorites."

We loved sitting on the porch in the morning and evenings and driving around the property in the golf cart. The highlight of the weekend was the bluegrass concert at Cumberland Caverns. Or maybe it was our sons visiting us from Murfreesboro! We'll be back.

Stayed about a week","George & Judy's place is a wonderful gem of a house located in a valley of nursery trees and shrubs, surrounded on all sides by the mountains. Behind the home is the Collins River, which is known for great fishing and kayaking. We weren't able to do this while there, but will plan for it on our next trip. The location of this home is ideal because it affords a great deal of privacy, while at the same time allows for a very short trip into McMinnville. Also - this home is right down the road from Cumberland Caverns. We did take the time to enjoy this and would encourage others to do so as well. They have tours to accommodate seniors, like us, as well as more adventurous hikers. The views inside the caverns are breathtaking!! George & Judy were the perfect hosts and greeted us with homemade goodies the day after we arrived. They immediately made us feel at home and we only wish we had more time to visit with them. Perhaps we will on our next visit. For those vacationers looking for that perfect spot in the mountains - this is truly it!! We highly recommend this home for a TN vacation rental."

Judy & George were kind and great communicators - making sure we had everything we needed (or knew of everything available to us). The house was clean, bright, peaceful and relaxing. The farm is quiet and gorgeous. A perfect place if you're really wanting a getaway. We took the golf cart down to the river and wished we had more time to enjoy the views and amenities. Only a short ride into downtown McMinnville if you need groceries, etc...and nearly next to the Cumberland Caverns if you want to visit a national landmark during your stay."

You will find yourself literally in the middle of nature when you arrive at the Collins River Retreat! If you love being surrounded by mountains, trees, birds (and other friendly critters) and some ""creature comforts"" of your own this is the spot for you. There are two awesome fire pits and one place after another, after another to sit and enjoy the beauty of the area. The Collins river is a beautiful swimming, boating and floating river and it runs directly behind the property!
If you are looking for a secluded spot where you are basically all alone to get some R&R this is the place for you! If you are looking for a family friendly place or a stay for a friends retreat this is the place for you! If you are going to Bluegrass Underground or a spelunking tour of Cumberland Caverns you will be the first one home if you book this spot!
IT WAS GREAT!"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved the area and the ambiance of the house, filled with fascinating antiques and cool decor. The lake was spectacular! We had a blast swimming off the dock, kayaking to the cave, and exploring the lake. The hot tub was a wonderful treat after a day of activities. However, we did encounter a few issues with the house. We wanted to relax on the upstairs deck, but it needed a good cleaning before we could fully enjoy it. The screened-in porch was also too dirty to use, which was disappointing. Additionally, some maintenance is needed on the stairs and rails leading down to the dock for safety reasons. Unfortunately, my daughter was injured when the picnic table she was sitting on broke, causing a cut on her leg. While she's okay, it's clear that the picnic table should be removed for safety reasons. Despite these issues, we still had a good time during our stay. To return, we may pick a different home in the area if we have kids with us."

It was nice being able to gather at our place to visit, and enjoy a family dinner.
The living room area was spacious and comfortable for reminiscing and storytelling.
The neighborhood is very charming, and we loved the location near downtown and parks."

The host was proactive and answered any questions that we would’ve asked right from her instructions. The town itself is small, but surrounded by some beautiful parks and easily drivable to breweries, distilleries, and some
coffee shops and cafes.overall very satisfied with our stay and would highly recommend again."

Stayed a few nights","Rachel’s home was an amazing place to stay while visiting McMinnville and Cookeville in late December (2022). It was super close and convenient to downtown/square of McMinnville for local (small business shops) and restaurants - and even groceries/stores if you need to do that during your stay. The home was very welcoming the whole time - with a very nice and super comfortable sectional sofa, tv and sound bar. The kitchen was superb - with a large/nice fridge to store food/beverages/leftovers, access to a range/oven and microwave, and dishwasher. Dining room (just off the kitchen) to have a nice place to enjoy meals, and the bathroom was well maintained and hot water for showers. Bedroom was spacious, comfortable and offered plenty of storage. Overall, also really enjoyed the back patio/porch to start/end day along with a cup of cocoa or coffee and see sunset/sunrise. Highly recommend staying here!"

Our host left little goodies in kitchen, and a bottle of wine to enjoy during our stay. The bed was so comfortable, and the bathroom linens were so fluffy and soft. Ahhh! Now that’s a way to relax at this little retreat. We had great communication with our host. She left info for sightseeing if we wanted to explore the town. Not to mention the cute brochures for restaurants to visit.
We loved staying here, and the price was cheaper than a Hotel room. I’m glad we chose this BNB to stay. We will most definitely be back.

Got to feed the goats, and the cows were sweet. They loved to splash in the pond out back. There's also a friendly rooster who would come right up to you. If you want peace and quiet, this place is for you!"

We really enjoyed spending time feeding the goats and watching the cows out in the pasture. We picked this location so that we were in the middle of all the places we had planned to go. But to be honest, some days we didn’t even mind just sitting around the yard or on the swing just disconnecting and lighting fires at night. It was just that comfortable of a place. I highly recommend this place and would come back again if ever in the area."

Stayed a few nights","I can't even tell you how wonderful our stay was. Every detail was thought out. We had more ""stuff"" at our disposal than anyone would need. From a fully stocked kitchen, to the plethora of toiletries in the bathroom, to the extremely comfortable beds. It's so small, but adding our names to the Roku was just over the top to welcome us.
The best part of it all was waking up, looking out the back window and seeing more than a half dozen goats waiting impatiently for us to bring them their breakfast. I was in my element, for sure.
Luke left a TON of recommendations for restaurants and local activities. It was way too cold for us to fully enjoy the outdoors during our stay, but you can believe we will check the farm first for availability for our next family retreat."

Our group of 4 (one couple and two friends) had plenty of space for each. The darling kitchen is fully equipped, even has a s'mores kit! The back deck and front porch are such great spaces to take a break, as is the swing. And the treehouse-so cute! Of course we fed the goats! We are walkers, and the nearby roads are nice for walking, not busy. It's not as far to town (15 min) as I thought. And McMinville has many dining options. It also is not far to the Whiskey Trail. One recommendation: In nearby Manchester is a fabulous bar-Bites of Europe-awesome beer selection and European food! Would love to stay here again when we come back for another concert at Cumberland Caverns (also fabulous)."

The barn took me back in time to my grandparents farm. I could close my eyes and see my Grandpa on his old tractor and smell the tobacco from his farm. The goats and chickens were the icing on the cake.
The inside of the house has a wonderful layout. It’s very clean and cool farm life decor. Very homey feeling. Plenty of room for everyone. The beds are so comfy, it’s easy to fall a sleep fast and get a good restful nights sleep.. We have found our TN home away from home! Luke, you have to let us know if you ever want to sell!!!
Luke has gone above and beyond by providing things like coffee, creamers, s’mores items, snacks, bottles of water (but the tap water is even better), wood for the fire pit, marshmallow sticks, shampoo and soap!

Having a washer/dryer available was a huge plus. Back yard was great and neighborhood was quiet but still within very close proximity of town.

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough about what a great host Caleb was. He gave us detailed emails of hikes, restaurants, and anything we needed. I have stayed in many AirBnb's and he is probably the best host I have come across.
The house was very clean and comfortable. It is decorated perfectly and had everything we needed. The record player was a bonus and so much fun to listen to some of the records.
Honestly this is a fantastic place and we would definitely stay there again!"

Caleb was a great host, the place was well stocked (loved the beverages in the fridge), and clean and comfortable. The only concerns was that the walls are thinner and the noise outside was a bit much through the night for the person in the front bedroom but I’d still rate the entire experience 5 stars!!"

Stayed with kids","We can’t say enough good things about our visit! The place was the cleanest I’ve seen any AirBNB, the kitchen very well stocked for all our needs, linens perfectly soft and everything squeaky clean!!! We have stayed at airbnbs before where they allow dogs, then have to burn incense sticks to cover up the lack of cleanliness. That is not true here at all. From a family that is very allergic to scents we were more than thrilled to find the house refreshingly clean and fresh from a thorough cleaning and not from scents to cover the lack of. The recommendation of places to go and eat were wonderful and very useful to us. We used the house as a gathering place for the family we were visiting and the space was perfect.
We look forward to staying again when we visit McMinnville next year. Thank you for a clean, well stocked, friendly, and all around outstanding visit!"

Stayed with a pet","Our daughter just moved to McMinnville a few months ago and we went to visit and help with her toddler. We didn't have huge expectations so we were more than pleasantly surprised.
It's an older house with a lot of charm and while there are some quirks, they are all good ones! The decorating was perfect for the era of the house but modern too. It was very comfortable and homey. The beds were comfy and the shower was great.
My only issue, and it won't keep me from staying there again, is the street where it's located. Cars drive pretty far over the speed limit and it was a problem walking my small dogs. It is very convenient to everything, including downtown.
We will be back to McMinnville frequently and will book this place every time!!! Overall we loved it!"

Stayed a few nights","Place was wonderful, even better than expected! Extremely clean, well stocked, beautifully decorated. I especially appreciated the detail and level of anticipation in the hospitality: not just coffee but GOOD coffee and grinders for fresh beans, not just linens but BLACK linens for removing makeup. I travel a lot, and small things like this make a big difference to someone as particular as me. I've been known to bring my own coffee maker and always carry my own linens to avoid ruining the whites, so well done! This will be the first place I look for when I am back next."

Of course of all weekends we go when they had a lot of snow and Caleb got the walkway cleared for us so we could walk to the house without an issue. That was so amazing and we really appreciated that.

we did not spend much time there except to sleep but it was much better than a motel. we would rent again if it was just the 2 of us but not if there were more. Even though it was old, it was very clean and that was very important to us."

Everything was well thought out and very well stocked with anything you can think of. I love places that have thought of even the smallest details. My kids loved the tire swing in the large back yard.
Ok, Caleb might be the greatest host I’ve ever experienced on Airbnb. I have been a crazy mess selling my home in Arkansas, trying to find one here, homeschooling, etc. I not only confused my arrival date but also my DEPARTURE date!!! I thought I was leaving the day after my actual check out day. I absolutely could not have had a more understanding and kind host. I am really blown away.
This place is an absolute must stay all the way around!"

The only downfall I would say, was there is not a lot of privacy. My teenager was quite dismayed that she had to shower in the master bathroom and the door to the bathroom, albeit beautiful, is a see through stained glass. So we were kicked out of our room if she wanted a shower. Lol all in all though the house really grew on all of us and even the teenager didn’t want to leave! Great location close to everything but doesn’t feel like it. Loved it! Will probably stay again when visiting family."

There was PLENTY of space. My mom and I spent 4 days there and never felt cooped up. The big front porch was perfect for unwinding in the evenings. I would absolutely stay here again.
The one time I did have to ask a question, Caleb was QUICK to respond. So kind and welcoming. Can’t recommend enough!"

Stayed with a pet","Caleb and Katie’s place is easily the most inviting and relaxing Airbnb I’ve stayed in. The entire house was completely spotless! I was grateful that they welcome pets so we were able to bring our pup along. You can see the love and thoughtfulness that went into every corner of the space. There’s a place to park right up next to the house, a whimsical stone path that takes you to the front porch, and a dreamy white picket fence that surrounds the property. The kitchen and bathrooms were fully stocked and made me feel like I was at home. There’s a nice gas stove/oven that we used to cook, along with a charcoal grill on the back deck where I grilled a steak while enjoying the beautiful yard and watching my husband play a little disc golf. There’s an awesome fire pit in the yard that I hope to use next time, but we had rain. The kitchen also has a dishwasher 🙌🏼 and full size fridge, lots of dishes, bowls, glasses for water or wine, utensils for cooking or eating, pots and pans, a toaster, a nice coffee maker, and I think I even saw a crock pot in the cabinet. They left us a loot of snacks and the pantry had plenty of seasonings and essentials. The best part of the home for us was the living room. The fireplace is full of romantic pillar candles you can light, and there’s an array of lamps you can use depending on your mood. We cozied up on the cute chairs and played a few records while enjoying the ambiance. I loved finding new pieces of art all over the home, especially the giant chalkboard in the kitchen. There’s books to read for the young and old, and a few toys for kids, but they were so perfectly tucked away in plain sight that us 30 year olds didn’t even notice. And just when we thought we had taken full advantage, we found a battleship game in the closet. The rooms were so cute and cozy! We stayed in the master bedroom which has an attached bathroom that hosts a claw foot tub. The bed was comfy and the pillows were great! There’s also a little table with chairs and an adorable boho hammock on the deck around the left side of the house where I sat and watched the sunrise through the trees. I wish we could have stayed longer because I felt so at home, but nicer.
Thanks to Caleb for the clear communication and for making sure we had everything we needed, including the code for the door. You guys are awesome hosts! Until next time."

Nice, quiet spot that is still close to town. We stayed in Barren 2. There is a small apartment above Barren 2 and if someone is staying there, you can hear footsteps and water for the shower/toilet, so if you're a light sleeper, make sure to bring a sound machine.

The place had a lot of potential for a longer stay but was a bit tough on me for a short one night stay. Let guest know to bring in food as the town closes down early at night.
Internet functioned poorly. No internet on TV meant no entertainment. So that would put a damper on any long term stay. This place definitely needs a better working one."

Stayed a few nights","The place was well kept overall however the kitchen floor was quite dusty and had a small of old scattered food debris. The wifi signal was very low quality because the wifi extenders have not been properly setup. I tried to help the host figure it out. Even though the host put some effort to sort out this issue, it was not fixed and there was no wifi for the entire duration of my two night stay. My recommendation to the host is to acquire a router with a stronger signal since the wifi extenders do not seem to do the job. I had a great stay otherwise and this place would have been worth the value if these items had been taken care of prior to my arrival."

It sits on a big, well isolated lot, very peaceful, well maintained and decorated, is not very far from downtown and really the hosts are super and very thoughtful with every single touch. Really enjoyed my stay here and probably had the best sleep in a while."

We arrived to find out the local music festival we had traveled hours for was canceled, and she went above and beyond to help us figure out what to do next. We didn’t know the area at all and she gave us lots of different ideas of places to go and really helped us make the best of the terrible situation. The place itself was super clean and cozy and had everything we needed. Bed was soooo comfy and having Netflix was a great touch as well. I’d recommend her place to anyone traveling through the area and we will hopefully be back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Great experience for our week long stay. Penny provided wonderful communications and contact availability prior to and during our stay. A very welcoming host. She kept us posted on a local power outage that we experienced on the first day from a local sub-station problem. The one bedroom unit with bathroom on the ground floor provided easy access and was a great location a short distance from McMinnville. Basic amenities are provided in the kitchen: full size refrigerator with a very good ice maker, toaster, coffee maker, dishes, cups, basic cookware and utensils. The couch and chairs provided a comfortable space for a couple in a small living room area with TV. Limited channels provided the basic access to Nashville stations. It was very clean and nicely decorated. The kitchen space was adequate for a couple with a small table and two chairs."

The only thing negative for me is that it is somewhat remote and I didn't have a car. It was 21 miles from the festival I was attending in Manchester. I didn't realize that there are only a few Lyft and no Uber drivers. The location is beautiful and peaceful and only a drawback if you don't have a car. I kind of inundated Penny with questions and she was very patient and helpful!"

Stayed with kids","We loved Bridgett's cottage. It was tastefully appointed, fresh, free of clutter, and already has everything you need - just show up and enjoy. Our group had 6 - 3 adults, 3 children - and we had plenty of space not to feel cramped.
Kitchen had all the usual tools and equipment, had a combo single/carafe coffee maker with pods. Bridgett left a plate of fresh cookies for us and they were delicious. The pet hens in the backyard were laying so our hosts left us a carton of fresh eggs.
Bathrooms was fully stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash; no need to bring anything.
Beds were comfortable (firm mattress on main bed), all linens were provided, including extra blankets. They had a pack & play for the little one.
Some hosts have lengthy checkout procedures where you feel like you're responsible to clean the whole house - not so here. Pile towels, put trash in bin, turn out lights, and lock door. We still like to clean up fully, but it's nice not to feel threatened to do so."

The area was super quiet and peaceful, the hosts gave us a fabulous introduction and tour of the manor upon arrival, and were super responsive and helpful. The pictures don’t do the house nearly enough justice for how many beautiful rooms and sights it has to offer, not to mention the rich history surrounding the house and it’s stories.

Stayed a few nights","A museum quality stay in perhaps the oldest house I've ever slept in. The street address has a suitably Southern ring to it, although not associated, as far as I know, with a famous Southern Nobel prize winner.
The restoration job that Jen & Jon have done on this historic house is outstanding. As a former contractor I was impressed with the work they've put into it. I took a lot of photos, inside and out.
But the real standouts are the hosts. I got a great tour from Jon on arrival, and later Jen gave me one, too. Before I left we fell into a long conversation which made it hard to leave. They have a sweet, well mannered dog, but it is not allowed on the guest room floor upstairs, and I would never ask to bring my own there.
Their emphasis, Jon told me, was to create a homey atmosphere where guests can come and go as they please, especially for long stays, and be completely independent from the hosts....but for me the hosts turned out to be a big part of a great experience"

This loft is a spacious, yet cozy place that made us immediately feel at home. The decor is modern, yet charming and very well thought out. We appreciated the high-quality appliances, granite counter tops throughout, luxurious bath towels and bed linens, and extremely comfortable bed. We enjoyed spending time in the living room with the faux fire place on and drinking our morning coffee while enjoying the view of Main Street. The host was great with communication and very informative about check-in, parking and area destination suggestions. We were in town on a Sunday/holiday Monday, which unfortunately a lot of businesses were closed, but plan on a longer, future trip to the area to explore more of the local commerce and old world charm of the town."

Stayed a few nights","Very large space taking up the entire upper floor of a downtown store building (hiking and outdoor gear), with a separate entrance. Restaurants, a coffee shop, and stores are just a few doors down the street. Granite countertops and a cute kitchen, and the bed was very comfortable. The only caveat is that you have to take your bags up a flight of stairs. Not a problem for us but it might be for someone with mobility limitations."

All amenities were provided and it was nice to host a Christmas dinner for other out of town family. Donna was great at making sure we were warm during the "" Christmas Bomb Cyclone"" and that all was well with the accommodations. This will be our first pick when we travel back through McMinnville.

Stayed with kids","I like to start off positively, in doing so, I will say that Sofie's Place was incredibly clean, and fit with ample linens! Treats were left out for my boys, which felt like we were going to see a relative, and that was nice! Donna was also flexible with us changing our reservation.

Cons:
1) Uncomfortable beds, which led to back pain.
2) Hot water issues in the bathroom past 3-4 mins of use (which I didn't realize until the end of our stay, due to taking a bath, instead of my usual quick shower),
3) The Family Room got very cold, making it impossible to utilize.
4) Missing kitchen essentials, which we purchased a lot of.
I would not stay here again. Even though we are very courteous, we were walking on eggshells due to the novel of house rules, which felt like we were being talked down to e.g. ""don't abuse the stove."" Had I received this ""novel"" with more notice, we would have found other lodgings, but everything was already rented. Also, we were asked to tip their housekeeper."

Stayed with kids","The perfect house for our visit to the local state parks. The toys absolutely saved us after our long drive and arriving 2.5 hours bedtime. They walked through the door and made a beeline to the toys. They loved hiking, but we’re almost as excited to come back to “our house” and play. The only thing I will note is that the host asks that you dispose of your trash prior to departure. We didn’t read the departure instructions until we returned from hiking Saturday around dinner time and the dumps were closed Saturday at 2 and all day Sunday. The host was EXTREMELY understanding, but just a head’s up so you don’t end up in the same predicament. I would highly recommend staying here!"

Besides enough beds, the common areas, family room and deck in particular, were spacious enough that no one felt cramped. The location was super convenient to Rock Island state park for hiking and boating as well as to the town of Rock Island where there are at least five antique shops. The hosts provide a great selection of water sports equipment though we were too busy to make use of it. The kitchen was well equipped, we prepared every meal there and had everything we needed…plenty of pots and pans and utensils. Towels and bedding were fresh and the house was perfectly clean. We were able to check
in before noon so it was almost like getting a free day! Brenna responds to messages almost immediately.

Great host. We couldn't have asked for anything more!
We loved the deck, nice big living spaces for hanging out and playing games, and a Roku TV.
We caught bass right from the dock!

Stayed with kids","I WISH I could leave 10 stars.This house exceeded my expectations. I dont know where to begin.The house is outfitted for real life. We brought a lot of stuff and didn't even need it. So many airbnbs claim to provide things and then you get there and find out they lied or the things they provided are suboptimal. This place was stocked like I STOCK MY OWN HOME. The knives were sharp. A keurig AND a coffee pot. Several varieties of coffee. Lots of spices, condiments, butter, sugar, everything! There were flashlights and bug spray. Extra blankets and pillows. So many towels. The towels were so nice.I'm actually on amazon now looking for those big white bath towels with the attached hook for drying for my OWN house. It rained most of our stay. So we weren't able to take any of the water toys out but they were there! We enjoyed the deck. We grilled. I don't think the listing mentioned the firepit, but they have a LOVELY firepit with TONS of wood and lots of chairs. They even have the sticks for roasting smores. I cant say enough about how much I ENJOYED my stay. It was only an hour and a half drive from our home in Nashville. The host was SUPER responsive. Responding to my messages within minutes. Honestly I don't have a single bad thing to say about this place and I have been staying at airbnbs for over 5 years. I have had some terrible and some fabulous stays with airbnb. I i have even hosted my own airbnb. I'm a neat freak and I cant tolerate dirt, dust, or loose hair on surfaces &/or floors. So my standard is pretty high. This place was clean as a whistle and I really hated to leave when the time to checkout arrived. If this place is available on the dates you're looking for a house on the water, BOOK IT! You will be so glad you did."

Stayed about a week","This property makes a great base when visiting the area parks and rivers. It is a well kept home on a quiet street. It has all the amenities you need, although I would recommend a different microwave with higher wattage. As the description describes, it is a bit of a haul down to the water, but you can drive to where the steps begin. We enjoyed swimming a few times, it was very private. We brought our own kayaks and decided to drive a couple miles to a campground on the other side of the river that had boat ramp access for $5. McMinville is nearby if you need groceries or want to eat out. We visited Fall Creek Falls State Park, kayaked as far as we could go toward Burgess Falls (hiked the rest way to the amazing falls due to low pool), and kayaked and hiked to Twin Falls in Rock Island. This area has some of the most beautiful waterfalls we have seen. Cumberland Caverns is close by and a must visit. This home is a good value."

Maybe I have been unlucky (we also don’t stay in real expensive hotels) but over the past few years it seems like many of the motels we have stayed in were lacking in the cleanliness department, so I was wondering what an Airbnb would be like (our first time renting one). Every area and aspect of the home was meticulously clean and well organized. If we can get back to see my daughter next year we will definitely try to book this home again."

The river was gorgeous and it was really nice that the state park was so close by.
Hosts were very responsive and attentive to messages."

Stayed over a week","Comfortable , Peaceful, and Relaxing! Just what we needed during our move from one house to another with a 10 day gap in between. After all the packing and planning we actually rested for 10 days before the unpacking and re-settling into our new home. I highly recommend a stay at this property and the host is quick to answer any questions, no mater how small. Our stay was great! Thank you"

Stayed over a week","Brenna’s place exceeded our expectations. We came here for a few months and were working remotely. The house felt like home, was well-equipped with everything we could have needed, and the internet was perfect for work. We enjoyed it so much that we even extended our stay.
The area is beautiful, with surrounding woods and a nice river, as well as farms in the neighborhood. The photos in the posting do not do it justice.
Lastly, Brenna was incredibly kind and accommodating. If we were to return to TN, we’d definitely stay at Brenna’s again."

Stayed with kids",We had a wonderful time staying at Brenna's place. The home was ready for our visit and a wonderful retreat for our vacation. Our daughters loved the bunk bed room and told us tonight they can't wait to go back. The lot overlooks the Collins River and is beautiful. I highly recommend this place and expect to stay there again the future.

Group trip","House was clean, in a quiet area, and had nice amenities. We had 6 adults and it didn't feel crowded. I left only 4 stars because guests have to take their trash to the dump. Really? If you check out on Sunday, the dump is closed so you have to take it with you. Our car was already full, it seriously put a burden on us. Other than that, it was nice."

Stayed with kids","Place is absolutely beautiful. Located right on the water. There is a very steep walk down to 70 or more steps to the dock. Watch out for snakes. We encountered 6 newly hatched copperheads on the steps to water. We did stay near hatching season though. Water is very calm. Perfect for Kayaking, paddle boarding, and canoeing. We had access to Kayaks, canoe and paddle boards with the house. House has a washer and dryer, just be warned, the washer sounds like a train is in the laundry room..lol. I would have rated this a five star if back door would have shut without having to put hip into it to close and keep dead bolt on, the kids bedroom door not latching and oven being very dirty. Overall it is a very good place to stay. Just watch out for the hickory nuts falling above seats on the back deck!"

Stayed a few nights",This is a beautiful home and a beautiful location. Brenna was quick to respond to all our questions. We had everything we needed to cook and enjoy our few days there. The home was very clean. It’s only about a 10 minute drive to Rock Island state park. It was just what we needed for a restful getaway.
