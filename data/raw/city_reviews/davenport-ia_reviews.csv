Stayed with a pet","Ryan's place was a beautiful find! It's in a quiet neighborhood, a short drive from several stores and restaurants. The kitchen and front room view were OUTSTANDING! Ryan provided a bbq grill for our Iowa pork chop craving. The front sidewalk stairs are not handicap accessible. There is a back alley that leads to a large garage that came in handy when loading the car. We will definitely stay there again for our next visit."

The house was in a great location and was well-kept. There was one bathroom upstairs and one in the basement, so just note that in case you have multiple couples staying. Would definitely recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","We LOVED Ryan’s place! My friend & I constantly raved about the area (nice, private, beautiful neighborhood) and how cute the house was. It was absolutely perfect for our needs — two gals and two dogs. We had a couple of hiccups with the fence being broken, but Ryan was super responsive and helpful…and we made a little make-shift blockade since the fence couldn’t be fixed while we were there (the fenced yard was really a huge draw for our 2 pups, so we needed it!). Everything was clean and tidy. We had everything we needed. We’d love to come back sometime when the weather is warmer to enjoy the backyard/yard furniture a bit more! But we walked the neighborhood trails a bunch, headed to Moline for a concert one evening, and totally vegged out our last night…and the house accommodated all of those things perfectly. Would definitely recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Ryan's place was very nice. The house was wonderful and comfortable. It contained everything anything you might need from the towels to kitchenware to extra bedding, etc. The bed was very comfortable, which is what I usually have trouble with when we stay places due to a bad back. Here I slept very well. My husband was thrilled to find the river was within walking distance as he loves his daily walks. The neighborhood was very nice and you felt very safe there. Being from a smaller city, there is soooo much to see and do in the Quad Cities. I highly recommend Ryan's place!"

Stayed with a pet",Fantastic place to stay. It is in a very quiet area and the home is extremely nice. We were in town for a softball tournament and it was easy to get to the TBK Sports Complex. There are tons of good food options in the area as well as a Hy-Vee or Walgreens near by if you need something. Many TVs in the house so everyone can watch whatever they want. This place is definitely worth it. We will be booking this place again for future tournaments.

Stayed about a week","We were very pleased with our stay, everything we read and saw about the house was spot on. We loved the fully fenced in back yard for our dog to run around, she felt right at home. The big open kitchen and brightness of all the windows was one of our favorite things. We can't forget about the basement also, it was a perfect spot to have family over and watch some football.
Ryan was very personable and made sure we had everything we needed to have a warm (we cam from Florida!) and welcoming stay, he did not disappoint. We will have no hesitation to stay here again next time we make a trip to Iowa!"

Stayed with kids","My family and I LOVED this cozy little home!! Looks small when you pull up, but very open and big on the inside. We also loved the large basement complete with a huge flat screen tv and table to eat at. The table was a great addition as our kids were able to snack and color/play games down there. Having 2 bathrooms were great, even though we only needed one. All of the little extras were appreciated too! Laundry soap, paper towels, coffee, toiletries, plenty of linens/towels. If you forgot to pack something, Ryan most likely had something available for you to use! Beds were super comfy and the house was well heated. We did hear a train a few times, but it never interupted our stay or resting time. Quiet, peaceful, safe neighborhood at the end of a dead end street. Ryan even said we could use the garage which looked to be newer. Nice size deck/yard outback for cookouts or for the kids to play. Backyard was all fenced in which was another perk with 3 young kids! Will be staying again!!"

I absolutely recommend staying here!!! First off, Ryan was amazing! He aims to please, and he is crushing it! The home itself is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood where you will truly get some peace. It's also within minutes of everything you want to do in the Quad Cities. My husband and I came with our elementary aged children and our dogs. We had everything we needed and then some. It was so nice to ""come home"" after busy days with family. I will definitely be booking with Ryan anytime we're back to visit family!"

Stayed a few nights","Ryan’s home is on a very beautiful and peaceful street. The house was very clean and nicely decorated. Almost everything we needed was provided. There is a drip coffee maker and Keurig machine and coffee pods were provided. However if you prefer drip coffee you will have to bring some with you. Also bring sugar if you use it.
I appreciated the food containers we used to reheat food.
Toiletries are provided like you would find in a hotel. Plenty of clean towels.
I was disappointed that there were no patio furniture in the backyard as pictured. We stayed at the end of April and perhaps they are only used in the hotter months.
We didn’t use the laundry facilities but there is a washer and dryer in the basement.
In summary it was a good stay and I recommend it."

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at the Lively Mansion! It was beautiful and well-maintained. The kids especially loved watching boats on the river and trains from the porch and the huge window off the kitchen. We had a large party and had plenty of room to spread out. Mckenzie is a very thoughtful host and we had almost everything we needed, and even some things we didn't (thanks for the cookies!).
It was a pretty hot weekend, and it was challenging to figure out how to manage the air conditioning, ceiling fans, and window shades to make the kitchen/tv area and some bedrooms cooler. This wasn't unexpected with an older/renovated house, and once we figured it out, we were comfortable temperature-wise."

Stayed with kids","Mckenzie was a wonderful and responsive host. Everything in the house was clearly marked with QR codes linked to instructions. The house was spacious with many old charms and quirks you can only find in a historical home. The house was beautifully renovated, especially the modernized kitchen, family room and mudroom. Amazing views of the river from several rooms. There was cute artwork and decor throughout and thoughtful touches, such as an extra coffee maker and wine glasses in the primary suite, snacks and games that make for a fun stay of more than 1 night. My family of 12 stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed it quite a bit. Everyone, especially the kids had fun exploring the many unique parts of this old charmer. Highly recommend!"

Between the spaces that allowed for family gatherings, the lovely view of the river, and the well-equipped and very functional kitchen, our Christmas get-together was enjoyed by all. Mackenzie offered to set up a decorated Christmas tree, which we accepted, and it was done as if it was in our own home. It really made the stay special. The business side of the stay (booking, check-in, instructions, etc.) was seamless and trouble free. We look forward to utilizing the property for future visits to the area."

Group trip","We expected the Lively Mansion to be amazing but it still blew us away! I literally said “wow” over and over when we arrived. Absolutely incredible home! McKenzie was a fantastic host who communicated so well. Aside from the home itself, the extra little touches took it to another level. We had our family Christmas gathering there and it was so functional for us. Multiple gathering areas, an incredible kitchen and lots of space for parking were just a few of the things you can expect to enjoy if you stay at this home, which I highly recommend! Thanks McKenzie for sharing your home with us!"

Stayed with kids","This is a beautiful home but keep in mind it is a very old house that has been renovated we did have problems with the breaker going out in the kitchen and living room that was fixed when we messaged McKenzie only 2 burners on the stove worked that was a bummer especially since it was Thanksgiving also there was a nail sticking out of the floor my grandson stabbed himself the nail went through his sock (no shoes allowed inside) we had to put a chair on top to block it, also the upstairs shower would not drain properly and the wood trimming on the floor is old and lose upstairs and does not set properly on the floor my sock/slipper got caught on it and broke I got charged $50. It’s also technically 3 bedrooms 3 beds with 2 twin pull out beds and the other bedroom down stairs is a leather small couch that reclines to smaller than twin bed it’s very uncomfortable, besides that it’s very pretty and location is very nice"

Group trip","This was a great stay. Close to restaurants, near the river, beautiful house. Mackenzie’s checkin and checkout instructions were the best I’ve seen with photos. For future stayers, just be aware that the nearby train is quite loud. It’s simply part of staying in that location of town, and the host provided white noise makers in each room to help. If you’re a light sleeper plan accordingly and bring additional gear to block out the horn during the night. Loved our stay and would come again."

The young ones loved exploring all of the rooms and porches. If it had been nicer outside we would have needed to be dragged inside. Lovely views! A super respectable Mexican restaurant in walking distance plus. Additionally, we cooked two full meals, ate them around the kitchen table and played games at the same table. The kitchen functioned great as the place we spent most of our time. The beds were comfortable and bathrooms beautiful! Stay here!"

Group trip","I can't say enough good things about our stay at the Lively Mansion - the house was immaculate, well-appointed and maintained and impeccably renovated. It's a charming, large house with high ceilings and large windows, and feels very cozy and warm at the same time. Everything we could ask for was at our fingertips and Mckenzie left thorough information for how to run the sate of the art appliances and many things to do -- but this was not surprising as she was friendly, helpful and communicative every step of the way. We'd stay again in a heartbeat as we all had a wonderful time!"

Bedroom is located in a quiet space of the home so I had no trouble falling asleep. I worked in this area 6 months and bounced from stay to stay. This was my favorite.

Stairs going up to apartment are narrow and steep. Something to keep in mind if you have issues with your knees.
The nearby neighborhood looks fun and inviting and wouldn't mind coming back to check it out.
A couple of my comments may seem like negatives but they are not, I'm just sharing some things that older guests may want to know as some of us have issues with stairs and tight spaces. Again, it's a great place to stay.
I will consider for return trips to the Quad Cities."

Group trip","From start to finish this host, Shane, and house were exactly what my family needed for the holidays. We had to adjust our arrival due the weather and Shane was very accommodating and easy to work with. Even granted us an early check in if needed.
The house was spacious! It allowed for the kids to have their own space in the basement for video games and shenanigans, the dinner table to fit a 1000 piece puzzle, and the refrigerator to store 5 days worth of holiday cooking.
The mattresses were above what we usually get in our previous experiences with booking large Airbnbs. Everyone made the observation of how well they slept outside the comfort of their own beds. Makes a huge difference!
We will book with Shane every time we’re back in Iowa😀"

The neighborhood is wonderful: family friendly, quiet, safe, and the neighbors are very friendly. Helped to feel like home. We even watched some of the neighbors fireworks on the 4th. The couch was comfortable TV was easy to use. The welcome booklet was very detailed and useful. Shane and Brendon checked to be sure we were settling in well. The beds were SUPER comfortable. I would say maybe the best we have slept on in our travels. Hot water was plentiful for showers and great water pressure. Nice to have a garage to park in as well. Check in and check out easy.

It had everything I needed to get my work done, make a few meals, and sleep comfortably at night. Everything is clean, comfortable and quiet.
Lynda is a friendly, responsive host and has put together a wonderful place.

Everything I could possibly think I needed was already there, laid out in a way that was easy to find with very clear instructions/labels. Lynda is also a wonderfully kind person and was responsive and also proactive about communication. The neighborhood is a quiet residential area. Don’t forget to check out the parks nearby, I had a joyous walk at the local botanical garden. Many thanks, Lynda!"

Lynda was also so kind to let me know the apartment was ready early, knowing that I had stayed in a hotel the previous night since the unit was booked for the first day of my visit. Having this resource is a wonderful respite for the very stressful trips I'm having regularly to Davenport. Well done Lynda!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Lynda clearly takes pride in how she prepares for her renters. The apartment is very clean with a well stocked kitchen to cook. She has additional blankets for a very comfortable bed! I slept like a baby. Also partly due to the apartment being in the back so your away from the street. Great water pressure, plenty of towels.
Lynda is an attentive host who responds promptly to a concern or question you may have. She was also flexible at checkout.
Understanding that I was visiting my elderly mother she offered “no rush” to check out which was very thoughtful of her.
One thing I would point out….you will read as I did from previous reviews that the stairs are narrow so coming down as opposing to going up you would want to be careful.
I am looking forward to returning to Lynda’s."

The rooms are dark and you need a light even in the morning or afternoon. If you are outside during day, it shouldn’t be an issue. Lynda was very nice and living next door with lovely dog. So, any issue can be solved immediately. We did not have any problem for our 7 nights stay. If you come to Davenport, we recommend Lynda’s house."

Stayed over a week","While not much to look at from the outside, the minute we opened the door and walked in we said ""oh, this is nice"". Tastefully decorated, comfortable and homey, Lynda's Fort was a great space for my husband and I to stay for 30 days while we were in Davenport. The bed and couch are comfortable, water pressure in the shower great, and the kitchen is very well kitted out. My husband was not a fan of the TV system (no sports channels) but there's Netflix, so there's that. Lynda was very easy to communicate with and checked in with us periodically to make sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed over a week","If you’re going to be in the Davenport area- this is the place to stay. Conveniently located in the middle of everything. Lynda’s garage apartment was very neat, and well decorated. Her kitchen is stocked with all the tools needed. Which was appreciated when meal prepping for work. Lynda made a wonderful host. Very thoughtful, checked in through messaging on more than one occasion to see if we needed anything. She responded quickly, and was full of great tips. I will be staying here next time I return for Davenport."

What an awesome place to relax, work, and do absolutely nothing but enjoy just being there. I will definitely book again next season. I'm most certainly adding Lynda's Place to my favorites!! If you've been looking for an Immaculate place to stay, close to everything. . .this is the place!!! Grab it while you can!"

Stayed with a pet","It was exactly as described. It’s an old house, but clean and updated. The neighborhood is old, but kept up nicely. Neighborhood was quiet.
I had no direct communication with the owner. I was sent the key code for the door and it was all I needed.
I would caution that the back yard is not fully fenced as listed, there is a foot wide section where a dog could get through. There is no bottom rail on the fence and so the dog could get under fence.
Not sure I would stay here again, as it’s not secure enough for my dog."

Hot tub, sauna, very cool vibe to it. Everyone couldn’t stop talking about the place. Derric was also super flexible and accommodating. He wanted to make sure we had the best experience. I would stay here 10/10 times. We are already planning two other events there and just a staycation for ourselves. (We are local). I’ve stayed at many air bnbs and this ranks up at the top."

We drove all the way from Minnesota because it was so unique and luxurious with the amenities that his place has to offer. We felt like we were at the theater watching movies on the projector at night. The electronic movie theater seating was a huge bonus! We opted to have the pool heated and it was perfect temp. Bed was extremely comfy and cozy.
The sound system is next level! We enjoyed all the tech - everything was explained to us and pretty easy to use. Thanks to Colten who met us right when we got there.
In previous reviews, when they say that this is an adult's playground, they are not kidding. We had such an amazing weekend! Definitely the perfect way to relax, play and have a great time!
Thanks to Derric and Colten for your friendliness and great hospitality!"

Stayed one night","This place was a great find - we actually live near the area, but we were looking for a weekend away from home to decompress without the travel time. This place fit the bill and then some! We were close to home, yet it felt like a complete get-away because we never even needed to leave the house. We brought in food. The kitchen was stocked, everything was extremely clean. You can listen to music anywhere from the amazing sound system, or watch TV/movies from anywhere - including a huge projector from the hot tub and pool. The shower is amazing. On top of it all, we were able to get in touch with Derric within an hour for any questions. Check in was a breeze - easy entry and we were met to be walked through use of everything. Check out was simple - it was only two of us, but took us longer to pack our food than finish his check out list. If you are considering splurging on this property, even for just one night, DO IT. We left feeling so relaxed and refreshed. Great place, great host!"

Colton met us to go over how to operate the smart sound system, lighting, the pool cover & hot tub. It may feel intimidating at first, but is pretty user friendly. At least, it appeared that way… my husband took control of the gadgets. 😄
Derric was extremely responsive to any questions throughout the booking and all the way through check out.
This is an amazing find for Davenport!"

Stayed one night","This was by far the coolest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. Derric was a wonderful host!!! Check in was a breeze, and everything from turning on the sauna to turning on the projectors/tv's was clearly explained upon arrival. This place is super high tech with an awesome sound system that plays throughout the entire place with easy Bluetooth connection to pretty much any device. If you like to listen to your movies/music louder than normal, you will love this place. The projector was super clear, and the quality was incredible. We watched an entire football game from the pool, and it was amazing. The place itself was also way bigger than we expected which was cool. The bed was 10/10! Super soft and comfortable. We are already looking into dates when we can come back to this place because it was that awesome. Thank you for everything Derric!!!"

The outside patio was very cozy with the swing and the fireplace. Going from the hot sauna to a cool pool was so soothing and being able to watch the projector from anywhere in the house was amazing. This is the perfect staycation for anyone who wants to get away without going too far. I’ve been recommending this place to everyone and I can’t wait to come back again.

Stayed one night","I am a local resident of Davenport and was looking for an anniversary “staycation”.. this Airbnb is it!! It was like our own little resort! Pool was amazing, hot tub was even better. The sauna was so nice to spend time in. Everyone raved about the shower and they weren’t wrong. The surround sound was OUT OF THIS WORLD. It was nice to have a projector that coutld be seen pretty much everywhere throughout the building. The kitchen was supreme. The bed was extremely comfortable.
It is safe to say I will be renting this again. Derric was ALWAYS very responsive. This was a very spur of the moment rental and he went out of his way to make sure it was ready to go. Instructions were very clear for check in and directions for check out were also very user friendly.
If you’re questioning whether or not to rent this Airbnb, don’t hesitate! You won’t regret it!"

Stayed one night","We hosted a bachelorette party here and what a perfect place to do so!! Open floor plan allowed guests to be together whether they were in the pool, hottub or just hanging out at the spacious kitchen island area. We invited guests to bring their own air mattresses and stay overnight and there was plenty of space for them to set up without being stepped over all night. Check in was a breeze and host even met you there to quickly walk you through the ins and outs/functionality of the tech so you could take full advantage of the modern features even if youre tech challenged like myself. Plenty of parking for additional guests who wished to stop and join in the gathering too. Pleasantly surprised with how comfortable the space was with it having the indoor pool and hottub, feared it would have a humid/overly chlorinated atmosphere (much like a hotel pool area) but that was not the case at all-- very comfortable with no damp/humid feeling at all! Very impressive space--great for a group!!"

Stayed one night","I recently stayed at this Airbnb for a weekend golf trip with the boyz, and it was truly a luxurious experience. The location was perfect for us, as it was close to the TPC Deere Run golf course, and the amenities exceeded our expectations. The hot tub and pool were great for relaxing after a long day on the course, and the projector and sound system made for an immersive music video experience . But the real star of the show had to be the 20 showerhead shower. It was like being caught in a rainstorm, except without any of the mud or lightning. I almost didn't want to leave the shower! And if all that wasn't enough, there was even a sauna to really help us sweat out the toxins. I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking for a luxurious and fun-filled getaway. Just don't forget your swim trunks and golf clubs!"

The property was very secure and had an alarm system. Very clean, modern, and top knotch amenities. An 8 foot deep heated indoor pool with an automated cover just by flipping a switch, huge jetted hot tub, and a large projector you could watch while in either. Also a cozy fireplace, sauna, and the coolest shower I've ever seen with 13 shower heads. Bed was very comfortable as well as the living room couches. Kitchen had everything we needed. If you bring food with you there is really no need to leave the property. Everything was also operated by either a lightswitch or a tablet which made it super simple. This place is perfect for a romantic getaway, we didn't want to leave. If you have ever heard of Sybaris, it is very similar but more modern and larger. Don't hesitate to book Derric's place, you won't regret it!"

I was in town to see a show and appreciated a comfortable place to return to for dinner leftovers and a good night’s rest. The blackout shades were nice and the building is solid, so I was not bothered by any street noise.

Stayed one night","We were in town for a show at Raccoon Motel (highly recommend catching a show there), and it was delightful to be able to stay just upstairs. The thing that stood out most is how insulated it was from the noise downstairs. While we could hear some muffled bar noise (and the sound check - which was seriously cool!), we were able to fall asleep quickly with a little help from the white noise. It was far beyond our expectations; we expected a fair amount of noise, since we’d be right over a bar. We actually got one of the most solid nights of sleep that we’ve had in a long time!
The hosts were very proactive, sharing all the info we needed before we needed it. All in all an excellent experience."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay mid-week through the weekend was fine. The location is great and there’s plenty of restaurants and coffee shops you can walk to. We also never had an issue with parking, even on the weekend so that was great. The place was a little dirty but not gross. A couple things to keep in mind that would be great if the owners would address is there’s a Keurig which is great but no coffee pods so you’re on your own there and there is no closet which is fine but no dresser, hooks, or rolling rack to put anything away.
It IS above a couple bars so Friday and Saturday night it is pretty loud with music in the unit until about midnight so keep that in mind if your goal is an early night. I read the reviews so knew this going in and we were fine with it. It wasn’t a bad stay, just for the price a few extra expected amenities would have been nice. Thanks!"

Stayed one night","Knowing that this is above a live venue area, I did understand going into it would be loud till the music died out, that just meant we went and enjoyed the entertainment of the evening. Unfortunately, A lapse in communication occurred and 2 people ENTERED the location that was intended to be private. Considering check in time is after 4. So you can imagine both the confusion, as well as concerns of thinking we were in a safe space. Probably won't stay again, but it did match the photos."

Stayed one night","This location cannot be beat! Right above the coolest place in Davenport...the Raccoon Motel! Easy to access, plenty of parking nearby and a large space to spread out if you with a full kitchen and seating area. Very walkable to other downtown restaurants and bars which was the main reason for our selection. Our hosts were very responsive and shared great detail for access and parking, my two main questions. The only notes I have are that there was a pile of unfolded linens in the middle of the living room (I'm assuming it was from previous occupant and in the switchover they were not moved into laundry) and some visible soap scum stains on the shower door (the rest of the bathroom was spotless and had full amenities). Thankfully we didn't need any spare sheets or really spend too much time in the apt so it didn't dampen our stay! Would recommend if you are in visiting any of the Quad Cities."

Stayed one night",We stayed at the Raccoon Motel because my husband loves the music venue so much. There was a concert going on so it was fun to see the concert and stay the night. The check in instructions weren’t very clear. We entered the bar and the bartender actually gave us a key to get upstairs and the code for our room. I didn’t realize there were a few rooms. She asked what room we had and I had no idea. She was able to find out for us. She was very helpful. The room was nice but my only suggestion would be to either purchase a coat rack or attach some hooks to the wall because there were no closets to use and nothing to hang our clothes on.

We had a family gathering for Christmas and the home was perfect for it. The home itself has 2 large living areas, spacious bedrooms, a great kitchen with plenty of what you would need to host a dinner, and bathrooms everywhere! Speaking of bathrooms, the shower in the spa bathroom is everything you imagine it will be!
The home is fabulously decorated with a great style. There are multiple location to sit and drink your morning coffee while watching the sun rise over the Mississippi River.
For as wonderful as the house is, the extra touches and effort Kara made to make this feel like a home for the holidays were even better. These are the things that make her a one-of-a-kind host! My family has already asked if we can rent it again next year!
Thanks for everything Kara!"

Great views of the Mississippi from the large veranda and outdoor patio. You might even catch sight of riverboat as it cruises up and down the river. It was easy to get anywhere in the Quad-Cities from there. Great value compared to suite at a big box hotel. Kara was a great host and the place was perfect.

Group trip","The house was more beautiful in person! It was so spacious and gorgeous. Everyone had room! We were out in Iowa due to my daughter attending her first year of college. There was some paper plates so we didn’t have to do any dishes which is always a plus, we were going to get some ice, but it was some in the freezer which helped a lot since we got in later than expected. The hosts were very responsive and accommodated us on last minute reservations. Steve and Sue were awesome and I will definitely rent again when I’m in the area."

Group trip","The host responded quickly when contacted. The home was clean and spacious, with comfortable furnishings. The home could use some minor repairs. One upstairs bedroom TV had no remote. We chose this listing because we had dogs traveling with us. The yard is large and has a privacy fence, but there are large gaps under it in some areas so it was necessary to keep our dog leashed. There was a small Keurig coffee maker provided, but not enough coffee for the 5 adults we had staying there to enjoy even 2 cups of coffee each morning. I don't travel with coffee, so this was disappointing. Overall, I would recommend this home."

Group trip","The stay at Steve's place was a nice easy stay for our one night in Davenport. The location was nice with enough parking for our 6 guests. The interior was very clean and homey. There were some brief issues (not necessarily the host's fault) that did disrupt our stay a bit. The lower basement level, advertised as a work space and child's play area, was under significant construction (carpet and flooring removed) and there was a leak around he water tank heater. The majority of the carpet was wet and the space was unusable. This was not disclosed before our arrival. The smoke alarms went off three times overnight, with no sign of smoke. Possibly a Carbon Monoxide detector or a fluke. Again, not under the host's control, but did disrupt our stay quite a bit. I would still recommend staying here as Steve was very responsive and helpful with all issues!"
