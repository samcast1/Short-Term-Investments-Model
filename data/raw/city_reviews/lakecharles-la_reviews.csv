Amazing views of the bayou, and close to great food. check out instructions were simple, and the place is decorated perfectly. The price is great, and the location for me is perfect. I'll definitely keep this cottage on my list of great places!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great little place to visit! You’re about an hour away from Holly beach which is a great shell beach, 45 mins from the wetland trail and if casinos are your thing tons of them around. Anything you need is just a quick trip away from the air bnb. The view from the balcony is peaceful and lots of wildlife to see on the bayou. Highly recommend for a quick simple getaway or a long extended stay."

The décor was delightful, very clean and the amenities were very helpful. Me and a buddy came to the area to fish for two days and didn't want to hotel it. Great decision. We cooked a couple of steaks on the upstairs patio overlooking the river. Doesn't get better than that. Shylah communicates very well. I hope to be back."

She also washed the sheets in a special detergent so our daughter didn’t have any allergic reactions. The home overlooks the river and is well kept. Very quiet and peaceful.

The apartment was very spacious and cozy and well equipped with everything we needed for our 2 week stay. We enjoyed the backyard view of the bayou and the singing cardinals. It was a quiet neighborhood and we felt very safe staying there.
Local parks and beaches made great day trips, golfing was good, grocery store only a few blocks away. Lots of great waterfowl viewing at local sanctuaries.
Although Westlake is very industrialized, we found nearby Lake Charles' historic disrict lovely to tour."

It was very peaceful and the kids had fun with the board games. The bed was very comfortable. The kids slept in the sofa bed in the living room, and they said it was comfortable for them. The balcony has a beautiful view. She was a gracious host and was quick to respond to my questions and was available if needed. We will definitely want to stay again when we visit Lake Charles."

Check in and out was so simple. She even provided a few perks to make our stay special and welcoming. Now the place. In WestLake right on the bayou! Incredible sunsets and sunrises from the upper deck on the back facing the water. Super cute little years with chairs and a spot to fish. Extremely well taken care of. We felt like we had our very own house on the bayou. Close to one of the best Burger (Round Top Burgers) places in town and some incredible soul food not far away as well (Biscuits and Jamz). We were here for a baseball tournament but recommend for families or couples. About 10-15 min to the Lake District but close to Cajun trail and lots of wildlife and gators you can see south near the gulf. Can’t say enough how good it was."

The bathrooms were clean and the water was hot.
The coffee and condiments was a great touch. Even the decorations made you feel at home.
Katy was right there to answer any questions we had.
A perfect short visit, but we could have been comfortable there for weeks.
We even enjoyed the peaceful back yard with a bayou and some visiting ducks.
The neighborhood felt safe and was close to town but still very private.

Spotless, everything you need for a perfect stay. Lake Charles has a lot of great restaurants and things to do, but you might just want to stay in with this little gem of an AirBNB.

There was a cat that lives on-site that scratched up the hood of our car. It liked to sit on top of the vehicles. The back door felt very unsafe with the deadbolt so low and I didn’t love how there was a door to the front of the home in the bedroom but other then that it was fine for one night"

Stayed a few nights","One of the most charming places we have stayed. This was our second time here and we enjoyed it very much. The hosts have thought of everything.
Keep in mind that much of the charm is that the property is not perfect-it has some lovely quirks, since it is an older house and neighborhood.
We love everything about it and had everything we needed-including a complimentary bottle of wine and a sweet treat in the fridge when we arrived.
The decor is unique and extremely cozy and felt like home to us. The covered parking is a wonderful perk as well.
We have recommended it to everyone we know.
Thanks for a great experience.

Stayed one night","It’s the details for me. What an amazing experience, from walking into the room with the music playing and the fireplace going it takes you from Louisiana to somewhere else completely. Opening up the fridge to a chilled bottle of wine and sweet cupcake, was icing on the cake (or cupcake, haha). Then, can you even with the handmade soaps in the bathroom?
Carolyn is extremely responsive and provides amble information for you on the desk, including a coupon to a local coffee shop.
The only thing unexpected for me was the location. It’s so close to downtown, an easy drive or Uber ride (unless you really love to walk), but it’s in a neighbor that’s currently being “refurbished” so there is a mix of remodeled homes and some rundown places that need TLC. However, I think this comes with being so close to a downtown area and no fault of the owner of course, we just thought it was important to note.
Thank you for a wonderful visit! You nailed it with every detail."

The home was in a great location as we were able to walk down to the lake and downtown to grab some breakfast. If you have kids there is an amazing park down by the water as well.
I hope our travels bring us through Lake Charles again so we can stay at this awesome home!"

Stayed about a week","Words cannot adequately describe how lovely our 10 day stay was.
Even though we have family in Lake Charles, their home was not suitable for accommodate us as my husband is extremely low vision and the steps.
However it was very important for us to have a home that “Gran-Mimi” could cook and have our family over.
After a thousand plus mile drive, walking into Amor was next level.
Extremely clean, stocked with a basket of goodies and a sweet welcome sign.
We were not encumbered with a million “to do’s” as in past experiences from hosts.
Let me express that when you look at the pictures of this lovely home you are looking at exactly what you will be staying in💯
I can’t express how many times we’ve been disappointed because obviously the previous places were shot with a wide angle lens!
And the master bed!!
Absolutely the most comfortable bed we had ever slept on.
In conclusion, you can find less expensive or more expensive but you’ll never regret staying here."

Stayed a few nights","My absolute FAVORITE AirBnB to stay in. Everything is just perfect. Spacious and comfortable and cozy and inviting. All amenities perfectly clean and working well. Love the garden tub in the master bathroom for a long bubble bath at the end of a work day. Can’t recommend this place highly enough. The only problem is that it books up quickly, so you need to rent it a month or more in advance."

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in many Airbnb locations in Lake Charles since Hurricane Laura, doing temporary work there, and this place was by far and away the best place I’ve ever stayed! It was in a quiet neighborhood, beautifully decorated, garden tub, all amenities seemed to work perfectly, big gas stove, ice and water in door of fridge, memory foam mattresses, ring doorbell for added security. Able to get food delivered via Waitr and also Walmart, no problem. Located literally two miles from where I was working near McNeese University. Love the pond in the back with the fountain."

And in a centrally located location. We were there for the New Balance Future Star Series Baseball Tournament and it was as close as 5-10 minutes from some of the fields and the furthest we had to drive to a field was only 20 minutes. I would definitely rent from Isa and Josue again. Great communication and we had zero problems.

They simply had everything covered down to the tiniest detail. I truly enjoyed staying at Isa & Josue's place. I cannot wait to visit again!!! Stay here and you will not be disappointed!

Getting into the house was a breeze!! Jamie’s clear instructions make you feel as if you are walking in to your own home! The house has so many different rooms and hallways…discovering everything was so much fun…almost like a treasure hunt, because each room is a true find!! This is definitely THE house for cooking, relaxing, reading a book, playing pool, hanging out with friends and family, and enjoying Lake Charles. Jamie has thought of every detail and personal needs in each room/living space. Just bring your clothes, friends/family, and throw some lasagna in the oven!!
Unfortunately due to the weather we couldn’t enjoy the lovely pool area and grill…but, there’s always another visit in our future.
The only concern we had was the close proximity to the interstate.
Thank you Jamie!! See you in the spring!"

Especially loved the living area, being able to watch TV in our down time and also play pool all together was nice.
The weather was amazing and we even were able to BBQ some steaks for lunch.
Not a huge gambler but the casinos were only a 6-7 minute Uber ride away. And the local mall was only 5 minutes away! Win-win for all.
Thank you Jamie for everything and especially always communicating prior to our stay and anytime we had a question.
We will return this summer!!
Gorgeous, clean and roomy home!"

Jaime is an exceptional host. Communication was top tier and she was so cordial, accommodating, and responsive. The check-in/out process was easy and she offered both digital and paper instructions.
From the moment I pulled into the driveway, I felt welcome. Upon entering, I was blown away by the modern touches and decor. The home was spacious and spotless. The bedrooms and bathrooms were immaculate. The pool table was so much fun! The swimming pool and LED lit bar area added a tropical resort feel to the home. If I had to guess, the pool’s temperature was a perfect 85°.
This property was the highlight of my visit. I felt safe and secure in the quiet neighborhood. I would certainly stay again. I highly recommend this beautiful home to anyone visiting the Lake Charles area. Thanks again Jamie!"

From the outdoor charcoal pit to the kitchen we had everything we needed to make some amazing meals! We spent most of our time in the pool and were pleasantly surprised to find so many pool floats to use. I do recommend bringing a life jacket for littles or weak swimmers as it is a legit pool and gets deep. The kids loved that it had a diving board! AMAZING! The game room was such a great place to hang out together as well! The couch in there is so comfy and spacious, not to mention the whole vibe is very cozy also. The pool table was a hit as well! Nobody was ready to leave by the end of our 2 night stay lol. My family had an amazing time and made some great memories! I highly recommend staying here!"

Coffee pods, creamer, lots of plates/kid plates, pack-n-play, etc. The host was wonderfully responsive and very easy to work with throughout the stay. Only a couple things to mention, no blinds in any of the bedrooms just sheer curtains, so if you have kids it may be an early wake up call. The pool isn’t heated and literally looks/backs to the freeway. There was a fair amount of road noise outside but didn’t bother us inside. Overall it was a very pleasant stay and I would stay here again."

When we got to town the other host canceled both bookings but did refund my back immediately 😩. So now I was basically stranded in town with nowhere to stay and air bnb was giving me the run away also . I contacted this host and she called air bnb along with me . They had so much patience and was very helpful. Definitely will stay here again.

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Hobin and Kelly’s home was perfect from check in to check out. Since we were arriving later in the evening, our
Hosts stopped by the house to turn on the porch lights and a few lamps on the home, which was so appreciated after a long drive. The home is in an upscale and beautiful neighborhood and we always felt safe. The location of the home is within walking distance (around the corner) of Prien Lake Park, and we enjoyed daily walks with our dog along the numerous walking paths around the lake and park. The beautiful sunsets over Prien Lake are a must see!
Inside the home, we had everything we needed for our stay. The kitchen was fully stocked, the rooms were spacious, and we loved the open layout of the kitchen/living area. If you are thinking about booking a stay at Hobin and Kelly’s place, I would highly recommend it! They are responsive hosts and go above and beyond. We will definitely try to stay with them again the next time we visit Lake Charles."

The smart lock feature added to the feeling of safety...having the code changed for each guest is great. Having lamps with accessible plugs and usb connection made charging devices so easy...no looking under the bed or behind the dresser for a plug. Hopefully for our next visit the temperature outdoors will be a little cooler so we can enjoy the patio which is so well set up. I was surprised how quiet the nieghborhood was...you can hear the birds calling early morning if you venture outdoors. We will definitely plan to stay at this lovely home again.

Appreciated the available TVs in every room, the coffee maker and all the available kitchen appliances. Would definitely stay here again, highly recommended!"

About less than a 5 minute drive to the casinos, or to the closest Walmart and Target. About 3 minute drive to the nearest Kroger and a bunch of other restaurants. Will stay again, recommend for anybody traveling with a group of 6 or less.
Great times! Thank you!"

The bathrooms were a good size and had good water pressure. The appliances were nice and it felt like a home away from home; much more comfortable and much less expensive than staying at the casino hotels like we usually do. Although we didn't visit any casinos on this trip, they were minutes away. And it was wonderful to have a host who could offer great local recommendations versus relying on Yelp or internet reviews. Will definitely stay here again the next time we're visiting family in Lake Charles. Thank you Tehia for making everything easy for us and for being so gracious."

From coffee/sugar to soap and laundry detergent, Shylah has every aspect of a vacation stay covered. Parking spot right in front of the entry door couldn’t be anymore convenient.
The property is just beautiful located right along the river. There are several outdoor sitting areas on the property to take in the beauty and listen to many songbirds.
Location is great with everything you would need just minutes away. Casinos with fine dinning just 15 minutes away. Lots of restaurants in the immediate area. The Gulf coast (Holly Beach) is a 55 minute beautiful drive. I would definitely recommend this AirBNB to anyone looking for a vacation destination in the Lake Charles area."

Stayed with kids","The cottage was perfect for my 11 year old and myself. He would fish every morning before I even woke up, he even took the kayak out by himself! I was too afraid of the alligators to go with him!
The bed was comfy, all the dishes and pans you’ll need for cooking.
One thing to note was the smell in the room was pretty strong with diffusers, especially for such a small place. So if you’re sensitive to strong fragrances you may want to ask them to remove all the smelly things a day or two before you arrive.
Also, there are no doors or windows that look out into the water, which would be nice, but nothing they can do about that. But not a big deal to walk around to the back of the house to get to the water.
Overall it’s a 5 star cottage. We would stay there again."

The doc was so nice to sit and enjoy our morning coffee and I had to sit for a bit on the swings under the trees because it was too inviting to resist. Shylah recommended a great restaurant so we could try authentic creole cuisine. She also made us delicious cupcakes for dessert. She goes out of the way to make your stay special. My only regret is we couldn’t stay longer."

Stayed over a week","Two complaints, first, the check out tasks. I disliked that the host asked to leave dishes clean, remove sheets, etc. Especially because I was in town for work. I would leave at 5am everyday, and get off until 7pm. I don’t have time for that. I barely have time to sleep. If I’m paying a cleaning fee, I’d think that’s what it would be for.
Secondly, there was an upstairs unit. Since, I was waking up at 4:30 am everyday, I really valued every hour of sleep I got. With the upstairs unit, you could hear absolutely everything.
Other than that, the host is absolutely great. She was quick to respond. Literally within 5 minutes. Resolved any issue I had. She’s great. It was so clean, smelled great when I first walked in. Ac is super cold. The washer and dryer was a great amenity. The backyard is peaceful. The area is very safe. Parking is inside the property. I would book again."

The one time we mentioned something, she and her husband quickly took care of it. In fact, she went above and beyond, and did so within the hour. When we returned, Shylah had surprised us with 2 more cupcakes (my birthday was the next day), a package of their local boudin (which was my first time to taste it ... and it was delicious), and a Christmas movie playing on the TV (because we had trouble with it the night before). Although the reason why we were in the Lake Charles/Westlake area kept us from sightseeing, we appreciated the brochures of attractions. Thoroughly enjoyed lunch (fish and shrimp tacos) at Steamboat Bill's before heading home. Thank you, Shylah, for your kindness! We hope to return one day!
Merry Christmas!!"

The hosts were very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. There was a storm while we were there, which knocked out the power - we weren't there at the time it hit, but we received a message right away asking if we were ok and if we needed anything. Once we got back, the power had already been restored but the AC was still out. We contacted the hosts and they were able to get the AC repairman out quickly and he was able to replace the blown fuse from the storm and get everything up and running again. We were surprised at how fast the repairman came, we can't get them to come that fast at our own home! The hosts were very apologetic and offered to reimburse us some money, even though the storm was completely out of their control and was no one's fault. Very sweet of them to do that! We would definitely stay there again - very cute, cozy and clean place."

Stayed a few nights",Joe & Kelli’s place was phenomenal! As soon as you walk in you can tell the place was super clean and inviting. There is a map of the world on the wall where you can pinpoint where you are coming in from! It was neat to see where each guest who previously stayed at the house was coming in from. There were four of us and we fit comfortably in the house. The backyard oasis was awesome! I would definitely recommend this house to people that plan to visit the Lake Charles area. We will definitely be back!

Joe & Kelli we’re so responsive to all our questions leading up to our stay and very helpful in recommending local food options to try during our trip. The house was great and cozy. We felt very comfortable and it truly felt like we were at our own home. We would definitely book with Joe &Kelli again, not only for the fact that the house was so welcoming but they also seem very kind and caring to their guests."

We especially loved the cozy living room with a large television and entertainment center that included a working electric fireplace. There was bottled water in the fridge and K-cups for coffee. We felt sooo at home. Honestly I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the backyard covered patio. Kelli was very responsive and accommodating to my questions. I really hope this property is available the next time I go to Lake Charles.

Stayed a few nights",WOW - I have stayed in many Airbnb's over the past few years all over the North America and Mexico. This is the best AirBnb I've ever stayed in. The place is superior in cleanliness - you can smell it when you walk through the door. The small details in this place make you feel like you're at home. The bathrooms are set nicely with amenities and plenty of towels! The couches are so comfortable and great for relaxing in the evening. The beds are amazing! I slept like a baby and had the best sleep I've had in a long time! There are lots of windows for natural light but they all have curtains so you can block out the sun and sleep in. I dined on the delicious food in LC so I didn't cook anything but the kitchen has everything you need for eating in. 5 stars to Kelli and Joe on their place!!

Stayed a few nights","I previously stayed with Kelli and Joe before, and loved it so much I stayed again. Kelli is just the sweetest and so accommodating. I stayed with them for a bit while working in Lake Charles and it was such a great place for me. First and foremost, the place is very clean and safe! I've always been particular about cleanliness and not many places meet my full expectations. As far as safety, I got off work late at night and never felt unsafe. Kelli is also very up to date with the new technology on home security and has it in her home. Secondly, she has great taste. The house is very homey, comfortable, and well decorated. My bedroom was so cute and nothing felt cheap. The bed was super comfortable with quality pillows, sheets, and comforter. As far as ""feeling weird being in a random person's house"", I quickly got over it. Kelli and Joe are so friendly and I could talk to them for hours! They felt like friends right off the bat. I never felt weird using the fridge or doing laundry. My bedroom and bathroom is in a section away from their room/living room area so there were times I never saw them. It's really up to you how much interaction you want with them. I definitely recommend Kelli and Joe's place!"

The back yard and porch are fantastic. You’d never know you’re that close to downtown. House was well maintained and furnished and there was nothing we needed or wanted that wasn’t there.
Some have commented about the noise/music from the bar next door but it never bothered us at all. Overall a great location, especially to downtown shops, walking around the lake, restaurants, bars, etc. 10/10"
