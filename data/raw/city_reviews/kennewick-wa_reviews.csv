Also there was no snacks at all even though it was advertised as having them. There was coffee and tea though.
Not worth the price we ended up paying after all additional costs were added to the original advertised cost."

Stayed with a pet","My husband & I needed an AirBnB for a month while looking for our forever home in Tri Cities, WA. Our son, daughter in law and 3 grand keiki (kids) live nearby. We came across Wine Country Guest House online which hosts beautiful panoramic views of Kennewick, the pictures enticed us of privacy, quiet and cleanliness (rustic, farmhouse style)…perfect!
Christopher & Chris were both very responsive at my many questions, and I had a lot! They even replaced the Amazon Fire Stick one day when it went out, plus replaced batteries in the smoke detector in the bedroom within the same day. The hosts offered us clean linens and supplies throughout our month long stay. Thank you, that meant a lot!
Our elderly cat, Mr. Paws seemed happier and healthier in the guest house, thinking maybe it was the water?!!! Happy cat!
Mahalo for a most enjoyable, relaxing stay while on the search for our new build forever home in Kennewick BTW we closed a few days ago..we’re super happy!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed staying at Christopher's place for a wedding we attended in the Tri-Cities. The place was perfectly situated close to the winery we'd be at for our friend's wedding and had nice views of the area. The neighborhood is all single family homes with large lots, so it's very peaceful and quiet. We had everything we needed, and the place was nicely furnished and set up. It was nice to have good storage areas for our things and an uncluttered and large space to stay. We would recommend this place to others and would stay again."

Stayed one night","One of my guest damage a end table they had on accident. We took full responsibility for it. The price tag on item was 24.99 but they charged 74.99 because it was a ""set"" and they sent us a screenshot of the item on ""Amazon "" but the item was bought somewhere else again for 24.99. Needless to say i wasn't happy. I took a picture of the price tag but i honestly knew that would charged Double but never dreamed they would make us pay three times the amount. And lie where it came from. Needless to say i wont be staying with them again. Yes it was my guest fault but i would have had to problem paying the 24.99 but to my lie to and forced to pay three times the amount goes against my values in trying to make money. I know we live in a world where everyone is trying to make a buck by this was very disrespectful in my opinion. If you break down the situation you can see it from my or a different point of view. We got the notification only 48 minutes after the check out time.Proves my point"

Stayed with a pet","Christopher's place was spotless and very beautiful! It was probably one of the best Airbnb properties I have stayed at because it was clean, modern, comfortable, and had everything we needed. My only concern was the stairs leading up to the property. My dog did not enjoy going up and down the stairs, and there was nowhere for him to use the restroom on our level. There was a yard on our level but it was only for the owners (which was clearly stated, not a surprise). To make it better the owners might partition off even a tiny part of their yard to give dogs a place to use the restroom without having to go down the stairs. Otherwise our stay was excellent and we would stay again. Thank you Christopher!"

Stayed with a pet","Overall an excellent stay. The place is as described in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. The only downside for us was our dog had injured her feet and there was no grass nearby to walk her on, so drove just over a mile to a small park. Not a big deal. When we booked the location we were under the impression that we could use the fenced backyard but this is for family only. This is not a reason not to stay and we would book again if ever returning."

The location was convenient. I especially appreciated that it was a really quiet neighbourhood and had easy access to amenities and the freeways.
The unit itself was clean, well appointed, thoughtfully put together, and very private.
Christopher was responsive and a great host.
I absolutely recommend this Airbnb for short term or long term rental."

Everything was clean, comfortable, with easy to understand directions to get inside as well as an easy self check-in process. The above garage apartment was very spacious and Christopher even had the AC going when we arrived. The balcony was a perfect place to sit to enjoy the view while sipping tea or have a drink (especially after dark). A short distance away is the Badger Mt. Organic Winery. Great place to buy a few bottles of wine and bring them back to the Airbnb to enjoy. Christopher had complimentary cold beer, hard cider and snacks to enjoy as well. Really enjoyed our time, very relaxing!"

Also, the chickens outside the door was a fun touch. On my check out day, I had the front door open and one of the chickens almost came inside to say hello!

Our family of four (myself, my partner, our infant and pup) really enjoyed our stay.
Nick’s place was well equipped with cooking equipment, extra blankets, laundry soap to go home with clean clothes and the place was absolutely spotless.
Checkin was extremely simple, and we loved how private the space felt.
I wouldn’t suggest this property if you’re looking for a walkable destination, however by car, Nick’s place is a quick 5-10 minute drive to downtown Kennewick where you can dine, shop and walk around Columbia park.
Would highly recommend staying at Nick’s place."

It was like a cute little apartment with the sweetest touches like a welcome booklet with restaurant listings and helpful instructions, snacks and drinks, and complimentary dog bags, laundry soap to wash your clothes if you needed… it’s the little things that truly made this special. The neighborhood was so peaceful and not far from so many things to do. They allow pets for a very low fee. It was so helpful for us to bring our dog with us and saved us money from having to board him. They had everything you would need, dishes and full kitchen, washer and dryer, pack and play for a baby if you needed it, and all areas were very spacious. I highly recommend this peaceful little home away from home! We will be staying here again next time we come to the Tri Cities!"

The neighborhood offered a lot of walking options and was safe, and both hosts were friendly and responsive! The only drawback is the cell service in this area was really spotty (and this obviously is out of the hosts hands). Inside the unit, I was unable to make any phone calls, which made working from here difficult. But if you're visiting the Tri-Cities and don't need cell service, I highly recommend this place!"

It was private and separate, exceptionally clean, and so comfortable that I haven't slept that well in my own bed in a while! When we arrived, we were given instructions on parking and how to get into the rental before we even asked. The couch is very comfortable for relaxing on and the bed is extremely comfortable as well! although we found it approximately 20 minutes away from most of the places we wanted to be, that was my favorite part because it was so private. I was initially concerned when I saw the chicken coop that there might be a rooster, but there is not! and I was thrilled! It was well appointed and I always find it a very nice touch when my Airbnb hosts provide basic amenities for the bathroom such as shampoo, conditioner, and body wash and this rental also included some q-tips and cotton balls and all of that was extra bonus pleasures as was the Keurig. I will be back!"

Stayed with a pet","This house was very nice, modern and a good place to land at the end of a busy day. We would say if you don’t have dogs this is a great place. Once all the construction is done and the yard and fence are in this will be ideal.
We did enjoy our stay, however I would say this place is more suited to a younger couple, my husband and I are retired and just used to a more quiet neighborhood in a small town. This was beyond Nick’s control but the next door neighbor’s 4x4 vehicle had no muffler and a large dog that barked half the night. These are not deal breaker’s but just making you aware.
Overall, we feel what you get for the price is very worth it_"

Stayed one night",As a single woman traveling alone for business my safety is number one. After a long travel day and unpacking my car I was happy to just relax and get settled into my new place for the next few days. As I looked around I noticed that the front door did NOT lock with deadbolt. It wasn’t installed properly and the bolt didn’t even line up with the jam. A few things were broken or toppled over. I reached out right away to let them know as I didn’t want to be blamed for such things. As I looked around more and put my items away for my stay I noticed a few other minor things that looked out of place. Not a big deal. Just appears that perhaps this is a newly renovated space. For the most part my stay was pleasant. Bed and couch were comfy every thing worked except the deadbolt. Hope they get this addressed.

We absolutely loved the backyard space - perfect for my toddler to run around and expel some energy. My son & I spent a lot of time creating some memories relaxing and swinging in the hammock swing. There was a high chair, playpen, toys, children’s utensils, baby books and games + puzzles. The rental is really accommodating to families with littles which was perfect for us! We came with a lot of stuff and there was still so much space in the house.
The home is set in a beautiful, safe neighborhood filled with families. We took walks around during the morning and evening times. Everything you need like restaurants, shopping, gas and coffee are just a short drive away."

First, we did not realize we had to have a subscription to ESPN to watch the game the guys wanted to watch and second, some streets did not have street signs so we ended up driving around a bit (our novice issues, not host issues). Overall, we highly recommend and would stay again."

Group trip",The Botanical Breeze was a beautiful large home. My friends and I had a marvelous stay and enjoyed every minute. Wide open spaces a wonderful neighborhood and setting. Multiple people enjoyed the outdoor hammock swing. The ktichen and dining room were fantastic and allowed us to visit and eat. We would absolutely stay here again! Tori was super responsive and able to answer all my questions. She allowed me to ship a package out there as I ordered it too late and would not get it before my trip. Getting into the house was a breeze. We all enjoyed coffee in the morning. Thank you Tori! (p.s. we didnt get to play Dutch Blitz but really appreciated the fact that you had that game in the house.)

The decor has so much character, you literally spend your first hour soaking in the wonderful creativity of the house. The view from the patio over the golf course is over the top. Shelli is an outstanding host, the place is squeaky clean, and she goes above and beyond to ensure you are taken care of"

The back patio is great for drinking a cup of coffee in the morning and enjoying the beautiful view. The neighborhood is quiet and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood, but the house is also very close to the Columbia River Park and the Columbia Park Trail if you want a longer walk. Restaurants and stores are just minutes away, making it a really convenient location. I'm already looking forward to our next visit."

Shelli was an extremely accommodating and cooperative host, very responsive. Even though the home has some highway noise from the front yard it was hardly noticeable inside the house. The back patio looks over a beautiful golf course and has a lovely water feature. A very peaceful place for morning coffee.
The kitchen was well equipped with thoughtful touches (half-and-half in the fridge, spices, basic kitchen supplies all there).
So many super cool period touches from the 50's - 60's throughout the house, and many original features still functioning within the household itself. The cherry on top is the fabulous album collection and old school hi-fi stereo system. Really far out, man!"

Home decor was thoughtfully arranged, with a mix of vintage items and modern touches that harmonized well. Host Shelli was responsive and efficient. We would have preferred to having access to the thermostat settings. The temperature was controlled by the host and requests for adjustments had to be made through text/phone ( it was was set at about 72 F, a bit cold for us). We stayed during the beginning of summer, however we would have preferred turning the air conditioning to a different setting at night on our own (it got cooler outside in the evening) rather than bothering the host at late/early hours."

I didn’t realize how perfect the location was for where we needed to be - and to nearby stores, restaurants, and other amenities - and yet still so quiet and peaceful.
The home itself is filled with such great eclectic treasures and decor! We loved the artwork, the furniture, the vinyls, and the multitude of books!!! It has a wonderful outdoor patio for morning coffee or afternoon enjoying a front seat view of the golf course!
Our full schedule only allowed us to partially enjoy all the amenities! However, it was a haven in the middle of our full schedule. We hope to come back for a weekend of “nowhere to go” and just stay in and relax! It’s a lovely home away from home.
Last but not least, Shelli, is an amazing host who is friendly, personable, and attentive to making sure your stay is the best! Her communication is clear and she replies very quickly!
Thank you, Shelli, for sharing your home with us! ♥️"

Stayed a few nights",We loved the decor and the location was good for us. Shelli was great at communicating whenever we had questions. We didn't notice in the description that the backyard is shared with an apartment that's part of the property. You never see the person and you do have privacy but we have a rescue dog that's terrified of people so when the dog was in the backyard and someone came around the corner we were all on alert. I try to create opportunities for positive experiences with this dog so having him afraid I feel is a slight set back for his behavior modification. But it only happened once while we were there and he survived. The sunrise was beautiful and the large windows insured a great view.

Group trip","The most accommodating hosts I've ever stayed with! Really quick to communicate, over and above customer service, very inviting! There was a group of us that stayed for a work project, so we only spent the evenings here after work and it was a true home away from home!! They even offered to come and get us a clean set of sheets, towels, and clean the bathrooms half way through our stay (we were here about a month) just out of the kindness of their hearts! I can't say thank you enough for the hospitality! If we're ever in the area again you'll be my first look up every time!"

Group trip","For context, we booked this to host a Christmas gathering of our children, their partners as well as for our local parents to drop in daily. Now, on with the review!
Superstar host! Communication was so friendly, timely and helpful -- can't say more about their communication style, it was the best.
The home was lovely, as described in their listing. Unexpectedly, they decorated for Christmas - all the way down to a tree in the living room and lights on the house! All we needed to bring were the stockings. :)
The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed and had plenty of space for multiple cooks. The island was large and usable. Dining space was consistently used for not only eating, but games and discussions. Living areas were comfortable and inviting. Bedrooms were all great, too!
(While there was never a lack of hot water (even with multiple people using it), they do have low-flow shower heads. So expect the normal experience of being chilly while taking longer to shower.)"

They left instructions for everything, and a special one for a pet (even though we did not have one). We didn't use their webpage for ""things to do in Kennewick"", but it is most informative for out-of-towners.
We had a small issue with the TV in the living room, and they were both quick to respond to our plea for help. I highly recommend this home for anyone's visit to the Tri-Cities."

Stayed with kids","Whether you're looking for comforts, amenities, a renovated space, great value or gracious hosts, you will find all of this and more at Kirk & Lily's lovely home. Ideally situated on a quiet street in a good neighborhood close to everything (literally no more than 15 minutes to anywhere in Kennewick, Pasco or Richland), the photos and description of this home do not do it justice. The layout - a split-level with full baths on both levels - is highly functional and provides plenty of privacy, while an open living room/dining room/kitchen allows for a great social space. Every bed was super comfortable, and every room gets beautiful natural light. The back deck overlooks a big, beautiful birch tree. Everything is spotless - even the garage. The well-stocked kitchen allowed us to self-cater for most of our two-week stay. Lily and Kirk clearly want guests to have a relaxing stay - case in point, rather than facing a big, intimidating list of chores to do on check-out day you'll instead see a short note about what you can do optionally, if you're not in a rush. That alone speaks volumes about the hosts, and if you have any reason to communicate with them during or after your stay, don't be surprised if you make a new friend!"

Less important things to note: two of the bedrooms are in the basement, and the layout to reach them is a bit unusual. And the house is right off a main road, though we didn't hear much noise from it."

The property itself was an absolute gem. It was impeccably clean, beautifully decorated, and thoughtfully designed for comfort and convenience. The attention to detail was truly impressive, from the cozy furnishings to the fully equipped kitchen. We felt right at home the moment we stepped inside."

Was perfect for our family and would be perfect for families with older kids/adult children/friend groups because of that alone. His place feels (is) much larger than the picture make it look.

Our two kids loved it! But it only went by a few times, so definitely not a problem if your worried about noise! It adds to the experience. The check in and out process was a breeze.

Adriana really thought of EVERYTHING a guest would need to make their stay comfortable and appreciated her responsiveness and attention to detail as a host. The patio area, large master suite, and extra exercise room/office space with a peloton were some of my favorites! Perfect for a family stay or WFH. The neighborhood is very nice, safe, and quiet as well. The only downside was that you can hear/feel the trains passing by behind the house every now and then, but after realizing what it was the first time, we got used to it quickly. Overall, a wonderful experience, and would love to be back!"

Let’s not forget to mention the cleanliness and that’s coming from a very upright on clean kind of person, especially in todays world and times. The place feels like home and the rooms are top notch. Complementary snacks available with bottles of water which is something I’ve not seen offered at other places, what a sweet touch. Plush towels and pillows. Nice private jacuzzi suit is how the master bedroom is all set up. Beautifully landscaped yard and outdoor surroundings. Cozy and very safe place. Will definitely try and stay again for longer when I’m there area. I actually loved this place. Don’t hesitate to book your stay at this one. Very highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent home! We would stay here again in a heartbeat and hope it is available the next time we are in Tri-Cities. The house is tucked into a nice, safe, peaceful neighborhood by the golf course with easy access to everything. The home was clean, the kitchen stocked, and the hot tub was a nice feature. Everything was tasteful and well thought out. There were even some goodies provided! We appreciated all the extra touches. Great communication. Thank you!"

The neighborhood is quiet and upscale with a view overlooking central Kennewick with little peaks of the Columbia River. It is not too far from waterfront restaurants. For wine lovers, which is why I was there, it is 25 minutes to Red Mountain in the West, and roughly an hour to Zillah in the West and the same to Walla Walla to the East."

The outdoor patio area is really plush with greenery and private! The hosts are wonderful. They even offer a complimentary coffee station and snack set up. Which is great after a long day and needing to relax! That and a private hottub off the master bedroom! The pictures are great but they really dont show it in its glory because its down right beautiful!!!! I recommend staying here! Infact I'll be back and will be booking it for family and friends in the near future! You're getting a fantastic upscale experience at a hotel rate! Seriously. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus washer and dryer available at your convenience oh, and you get free pods to do laundry??? Say what? Not kidding.... Don't forget there is also a dbl garage you can park in! Ive stayed at some high end price tag places. This offers that, but super affordable! A FAVORITE"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed the nice neighborhood and the house’s proximity to the golf course and good walking areas. The house has lots of windows and provides a great view of the city lights. It was comfortable and clean, and we liked that it was tidy, uncluttered, non-smoking, and pet-free. We did not cook at the house as we were usually at our son’s house nearby, but the kitchen was well equipped for guests who do choose to cook there. We did, however, give the laundry room washer and dryer a good workout!
We appreciated that the owner Braylon was excellent at communicating and that he responded quickly to my messages. We had no issues or problems, but I felt confident he would address any concerns in a timely manner. Check in and check out were both easy, and the instruction binder positioned on a table in the entry way was very helpful.
We would like to stay at Braylon’s house again during a future visit."

Stayed about a week","Braylon's place was absolutely stellar! :)
The cleanliness and pristine condition of the house upon our arrival was remarkable. I believe that the house looks even better than the pictures!
The place feels more and more like home as time goes by. The neighborhood is beautiful and feels very safe. The houses are quite spaced apart and divided by greenery, so it is more private than you'd expect.
You might not realize it but the master bath & master bedroom are literally joined together as one room. In fact, the private hot tub is right outside the master bedroom, so you can get to it directly from that room. I thought that was very cool, the pictures don't do it justice!
Everything from the kitchen, to the internet, to the faucets, and hot water, functioned very well. And having access to the garage is a huge plus.
I think Braylon has done an outstanding job maintaining the place so that all guests can enjoy everything it has to offer! But I think it's best you see for yourself."

Stayed one night","The house was very clean and as advertised. All amenities were as expected and the hot tub, with the sliding door to let the evening and morning air/views in, was amazing! I just have one complaint, which seems to be something of a standard these days for Airbnb hosts that I have a hard time getting on board with - house rules for cleaning that include stripping beds and starting laundry. With a $75 cleaning fee included, doing laundry for the host seems like a superfluous ask. With a four hour window between check out and check in, the host (or hired cleaning crew) should have plenty of time to do laundry and put away dishes. Maybe this is my soapbox moment, but Airbnb expectations/standards have changed and as a long time guest and customer, it’s disappointing to see.
That said, the house was lovely."

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough positive things about Glenn's place. Don't let the surrounding industrial area stop you from staying at this little oasis. The grounds are lush and well cared for and very private. From the moment I drove up, I was presented with a little bit of paradise and greeted by the easy going, friendly hosts. The little cottage was super clean, comfortable and nicely themed. It had everything I needed and more. All the little extra touches made it feel like home. It was a very warm day when I arrived and the hosts had the AC going for me - so thoughtful. It was heaven stepping into my cool little abode after a long hot day of traveling. The place looks exactly like advertised. I found the bed to be very comfortable and enjoyed a good night's sleep. As a single traveler, my sense of security if very important to me. I felt very safe and at home at Glenn's place. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend it! There's a reason they are super hosts - they've earn it!"

Stayed one night","I need to a blog to share all that I love about this rental! I’m not familiar with the area, but it was only a 7 minute drive to the airport. It immediately felt “like home” entering the tree-lined driveway and was surrounded by impeccable flower gardens and a large yard with multiple seating areas. The space was perfectly sized for a couple, although I felt safe staying alone and was pleasantly surprised to be personally greeted by the host. His hospitality was outstanding and although I never saw him again, I knew I could call him if anything was needed. The furnishings & decor were beautiful and the kitchenette was well stocked. The unit has some smart updates like AC, beverage fridge, walk-in shower, TV, and separate eating/living areas. I honestly didn’t want to leave. It would be a perfect mini vacation location near the city and I would absolutely stay here in the future! Perfect rental for anyone flying in/out and looking for a retreat."

A clean, comfortable and well-appointed place to relax after spending the days running around visiting. Don't expect to be doing any gourmet cooking in the kitchen, but it is very well suited for a simple breakfast, a quick sandwich or a snack. The Columbia River is only a few minutes away by foot, and offers great walking and bicycling possibilites. All in all, the place met all of our needs for a nice visit to the Tri-Cities area, and Glenn is a friendly, easy-going and attentive host."

AND there is a decent public transit system, at least for the route #3 and the ride into Pasco:)!"

Cute little cottage with the privacy we were looking for. Well set up and instructions were clear. FYI - there is no freezer, stove or range. We didn't need those and I'm sure it was clear on the listing they weren't included, but if you're like me and don't pay close attention to that but you read these reviews - there you go. Loved that you kept the place close to the original as possible. Gives it lots of character."

Not a full kitchen, not that it is presented as such. The refridgerator is small and decent sized (no freezer) and there are plates/utensils/mugs etc. The microwave works well for quick heat up food.
They added an adjustable electric fireplace and mantel under the TV. The fireplace has a remote and you can play with color combinations (the bottom crystals and flames). Very cool.
The bed is very comfortable with quality sheets and blankets.
The outside yard is very nice on a huge lot. The home is located in a commercial area but once there, you wouldn't know. Reasonably quiet and could hear the train every now and then. Because it's off the main road a bit, you don't hear most traffic noise.
Bottom line: highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","This little guest cottage is a gem of a place to stay. I was here for work for a week and it was so nice to be here rather than in a hotel. The location is beautiful, I only wish I had been here when the amazing yard and flower gardens were in bloom! Easy access to all things Tri-Cities. It was well appointed, although be sure to pay attention - it does not have a full kitchen! I was a little surprised by that, but what it did have made up for it well enough including the jar of chocolates I just couldn't stay away from (and I should have realized this upon reserving it, so this is my own fault). The bed was dreamy, the couch and cozy blankets also a wonderful touch along with the Roku and TV making it easy to log-in to watch my shows after a long day at work. The decor is perfect with its National Parks theme. I especially loved the View Master and collection of discs from all the different parks - so fun! The house can be a bit cold (at least at the time of year I visited) but the heaters are efficient, though can be loud when you're trying to focus on work (might just be me and my sensitivity to noise!) It might be worth knowing also, speaking of noise, that there is a train that runs very near here. For a single woman traveling alone, this was an awesome place to call home for a week. I would definitely stay again."

It was extremely kid friendly because it included a trampoline (kids couldn’t stop jumping), a foosball table in the garage and a corn hole set up.

The house was perfect for our needs. Very clean, really comfortable beds (two of my main careabouts). The kitchen is very well stocked - we were able to do our Thanksgiving food prep with no trouble! The house is conveniently located - easy access to nice grocery stores, restaurants, shopping (and Toyota Center if you want to catch the Tri Cities Americans)! No complaints at all - we will definitely stay again when we next visit the area."

This house was very clean and comfortable and the hosts really go that step beyond in terms of their attention to detail that bring this place a notch up: tasty snacks and bottled water, nice soap and shampoo for the shower, Ziplock bags and a large spice collection in the kitchen, and the very enjoyable hot tub on the back patio. Everything was easy to find and use and both the bed and the couch were especially comfortable. Highly recommend staying here."

Super responsive, super professional, and friendly. The home is new, well decorated and beautiful. I would say a downside would be it backs up to a busy street, although it quiet down after evening hours. Improvements that could make this really comfortable and beautiful home even better would be more comfortable living room furniture as well as 1/2 of the Jacuzzi jets weren’t working but I am sure they will get on this very quickly. I would definitely stay at one of their properties again."

The location was perfect, near restaurants and wineries with a hot tub (including a privacy pull-down) and a great place to walk in the morning. They welcomed our 2 dogs as well which was fantastic. Isidro reached out to us when they heard from a previous tenant that the outdoor fire wasnt working to let us know they would be happy to come over and switch out the gas. Really proactive and easy to communicate with. They even offered to let us in early the day of check in (definitely a bonus!). We were very happy with our wonderful vacation at this house. We highly recommend staying here."

I want to call some past rentals and say look at this listing we are at now, this is how it should be!!!
If there was a manual of how to best set up, decorate, and have amenities at an AIr bnb , it should have this home as their feature!
Thank you for your great property! Our family of 5 had a seamless stay!"

I would say the house/amenities, the communication before and during our visit were excellent and we would absolutely stay there again if visiting in the future (hope that it's available as something this nice surely will be hard to get a reservation). They offer a discount card for their restaurants for guests staying at their house and we went to 2 of the 3 that they own and the food and service were excellent. Normally when giving a review there is always something that is written that is not so rosy and I'm sorry to say that I too have to write something. My wife absolutely loved how their house was decorated and now I'm tasked with having to change our home to be more like theirs. Thank you Isidro and Elsa for making our trip there for our son's wedding so enjoyable."

A fully stocked kitchen with seasonings/spices, kitchen knives and utensils, silverware, plates, napkins, dish soap and scrub. You name it! Everything I needed was basically there for me to use. There were so many things to do! There were boxing gloves, foosball, bikes with helmets, yoga mats and small gym equipments located in the garage for us to use. The backyard had a cozy spot for bonfire time. Not only that, there was a hot tub and trampoline to kill time with too. The house was beautifully decorated and completely sanitized for us. There was a closet with extra towels and extra blankets if needed. The hosts were very welcoming! The communication with the hosts was great! They were on the standby to assist us in anyway that they could. I could not stress enough about how much we loved this place! Do yourself a favor and stay here if you’re in Tri-Cities! This is by far one of the best airbnbs that we have ever stayed in! Thank you, Isidro and Elsa!"

Got a text after we checked out that we left a stain on chair, didn’t get a photo of stains but I did get one with water spots of them cleaning the chair , was told if they didn’t come off I would be charge . The hot tub is broken so you can’t use that. If you step out you can’t lock the front door ( doesn’t work ) you will have to go through the garage. When you get to the Airbnb there are more rules on a sheet of paper that you aren’t aware of before you pay. Make sure your car doesn’t leak oil. Mine doesn’t but my guest did and that cost me $190.05. I payed it. Also my sisters were chit chatting in leaving room and you cloud hear them talking like they are outside your door. Walls are very hollow you can hear everything. Decorating is on point! They do have have all the essentials you would need in a kitchen. And have comfortable blankets. And lots of towels. View is nice."

The guest house was clean and private with everything I needed, and the bed was super comfortable with a memory foam topper. I’d definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","New clean spacious quiet pleasant place with up-to-date appliances set well behind the host's house.
Great communication with the host.
Great place for our dog. He could step outside into a large yard shared with the main house. He enjoyed meeting the hosts dogs.
Internet was slow (2 Mbps per Ookla). Some of the slowness was due to the heat wave. Internet across the area was slow. It was good enough to use e-mail."

Stayed a few nights",The Tiny House was great. I loved the fact is was behind the owners home and it was very quiet. We had issues with the wifi but Hillary was very quick to respond to our need. I even ask if there was an iron and Hillary supplied a full size iron and iron board. she is super friendly and helpful. only down point was no coffee pot but Hillary received tge suggestion for future renters. We would stay again if we come to Kennewick again. our miniature Schnauzer puppy loved the big yard too! tge neighborhood is great to walk the dog as well!
