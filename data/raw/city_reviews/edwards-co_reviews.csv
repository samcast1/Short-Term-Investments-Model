Stayed a few nights","My son and I stayed here for a Beaver Creek ski trip. The location is perfect, very close to town and the ski mountain. Very clean, Matt has thought of everything. There were only two of us, but the condo would be perfect for up to 6. The living room is comfortable with a fireplace perfect for after a long day of skiing, and the kitchen is large and well stocked. Matt was very communicative before the trip and available for whatever we needed. I’d highly recommend Matt’s condo for your stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Very cozy apartment in a quiet place and very close to Beaver Creek and Vail station ( about 10 minutes or a little longer). Very well equipped, everything we needed in the apartment, in addition to Courtesy of coffee capsules, dish soap and clothes, hygiene kit in the bathroom, among others.
Bed in the largest room very comfortable, tasty fireplace in the living room.
Quick in-response host and extremely polite. There was a book with nearby restaurant recommendations and basic guidelines.
Finally, I will miss our space and we will certainly be back. were wonderful days!"

Stayed a few nights","Location was so convenient for walking EVERYWHERE! The lake is so close, and the views were amazing! Lots of little conveniences in the unit - camp chairs to take to the lake to watch the sunset; some staples for kitchen that were a nice convenience; even some games/puzzles if there had been more time - we did play cards, so that was kind of fun. My son said the murphy bed mattress was very comfortable too. I most especially liked sitting in the morning sun on the patio with my coffee, and sitting in the bedroom nook at night, reading. Very cozy and welcoming space. I will DEFINITELY be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Well, where do I start? My husband and I had the best time! It was extremely easy to work with the host and we had everything we needed for a fun relaxing time! Avon/Beaver creek is a must see prime location. We were incredibly impressed with the condo. It is very cozy and VERY clean. The view is out of this world. It was very quiet at night. It is close to the elevators and easy to park and get in and out of the garage. The shower was hot and had great water pressure. The beds were comfortable and clean! It is close to great restaurants, shopping and the grocery store, which were all in walking distance or a short drive. There is so much to do and see, we will definitely be heading back!!"

It has a fantastic mountain view from the balcony and living area. The bed was very comfortable and the unit’s washer and dryer came in handy. It’s a wonderful place to stay in Avon. We’ll for sure stay here again!

Stayed one night","Location, Location, Location!! Everything you would want or need to do is within a 5 minute walk, including the Westin Gondola, which is just across the street. I was able to walk to the lake, restaurants, bars and shopping.
Once you get there, you won't need your car anymore, but the heated, underground garage was a nice perk as were the elevators so I didn't have to lug my stuff up 3 flights of stairs!
The unit itself was very welcoming and clean. Everything I needed was in the kitchen and they even had a stocked spice rack!
My favorite part was sitting on the private balcony and enjoying the great views of Beaver Creek. And get this, the gas grill actually lit with the clicker switch!
It was a great escape and I look forward to returning."

Stayed a few nights","We had a really nice stay at this property. We stayed here with our 2 kids (1 year and 3 years old) and the grandparents. We all had plenty of space and privacy and the bedrooms are on separate floors. This is a very well maintained condo and is free of clutter but also has everything you need! The kitchen is newly redone, has high end appliances, and is very well organized and equipped. The grill was clean and easy to use. Extra A+ points for the black out shades in the kids bunk room which was essential for naps!! The beds were extremely comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. We enjoyed using the hot tub after skiing at the nearby resorts (Beaver Creek and Vail). The property is walkable to downtown Edwards (although we didn’t walk cause we stayed in the winter) and we enjoyed the local restaurants nearby. FYI - a suburban sized car will not fit in the garage but there is parking in the drive way. I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking to visit the area!"

The fire place was out of order and the community hot tub appeared to be closed for the season, those are typically things people are looking for on a ski trip so I’d confirm they are working with the host if those are dealbreakers. We had a great time regardless!"

Great area and easy drive to ski at arrowhead or beaver creek. Only about 20 min to vail but I liked staying in Edwards because it was a little calmer and low key. Brandon was always a great host who was always responsive. Can’t wait to come back next season!

Stayed with kids","We took a weekend trip for some spring skiing at Beaver Creek. The house was as listed and with a bonus of having a crib and toys for the kids! The host was very responsive to all questions and even allowed a late check out so we could get the kids packed. The hot tub was a very close walk in the backyard and was very warm & inviting! The beds were comfortable. They had extra linens, towels for the hot tub, and a well-stocked kitchen. There was plenty of parking (even when we brought three cars!) Only difficulty we had was finding the place (internet directions are wrong) but the host had provided a map with clear instructions. Beaver creek was a quick 10-15 minute drive and there was excellent coffee within 4 minutes. Overall, an excellent & peaceful spring stay in Edwards!"

Stayed a few nights","Brett’s place was exactly as listed, exactly as described. His check-in instructions were prompt, clear, and helpful. The area is beautiful and quiet with a clear view of the mountains. Internet worked well so it’s a good spot for working remotely. Close to beaver creek and vail if you have a car. Shuttle is a bit more tedious but doable. Bit of a trek to the stop though if you have all your ski gear. They also have a pretty solid amount of pots / pans / cooking and even baking utensils if you plan to use the kitchen. Electric stove though.
Definitely would stay again. Price was reasonable and it’s one of the few remaining airbnbs I’ve encountered that just includes everything in the listed price without adding on cleaning fees / whatever other fees at the end."

Stayed a few nights","Brett’s place was the most welcoming AirBnB we have yet stayed at. It felt like visiting our grandparents, which was a nice feeling at the end of a long day’s drive. The kitchen is spacious and also the best equipped that we’ve ever stayed at. We liked sitting on the porch with our coffee and watching the yellow aspens in the evening and watching the sunrise over the local mountains in the morning and deer chomping the neighbors’ foliage across the cul-de-sac. It was a quiet refuge away from the more frenetic Vail Village downtown area, but just a quick drive down the freeway to get there. We would like to go back again."

The place was even better that we expected and was extremely cozy and had everything we needed including good kitchenware and throw blankets! The internet worked extremely well which helped a lot with a bit of phone service struggles. The Keurig and fireplaces in both the living room and bedroom were extremely nice touches! It was the perfect place to WFH and relax after a hard day on the slopes! Would highly recommend.

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough about the host or this property. Brett has gone beyond to make our stay enjoyable and worry free. He realized how late we will be checking in, so he offered to get us groceries. When we got to the property, he had water (very important), eggs, bread, etc. just to get us started. The place was awesome. The bed was very comfortable. My son (6' tall) slept on the couch and never once complaint. There's an electric fireplace in the bedroom which was very nice cuz it can get cold at night. There's also 2nd fireplace in the living area, so it makes the place very comfortable. Many places that I've stayed, the utensils drawers and cabinets were always dirty. But this property was very well kept from the bathroom to the kitchen. Definitely will stay here again. Thank you, Brett."

Stayed about a week","LOTS OF POSITIVES:
Host: Brett is a great host, friendly and very responsive to any questions or requests.
Apartment: Very spacious. A separate bedroom provides a degree of privacy, the kitchen/dining area has ample space for preparing and eating meals, and the living room has ample space for relaxing/lounging around -- including a gas fireplace that gives it a nice cozy feel.
Location: Outstanding. The apartment is 5 minutes from the main shopping area of Edwards, which includes a City Market, bank, several ski/cycle/outdoor sports shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, and other services. If you're a skier, you will be about 5 minutes from Beaver Creek's Arrowhead lift, about 10 minutes from its main parking lots in Avon, and about 20 minutes from Vail's Lionshead gondola parking. Nearby nonskiing options include the thermal spas at Glenwood Springs (less than an hour away), the red-rock mountain biking areas of western Colorado & eastern Utah (several hours away), and lots of local snowshoeing/hiking trails.
THINGS TO CONSIDER:
The apartment does not have any closets or an armoire to hang up clothes, so consider bringing your own clothesline and plastic hangers, and improvise."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at Brett’s place, it was perfect for a few days skiing at Beaver Creek and Vail. Clean, cosy, comfortable with a good shower and a fully-equipped kitchen...everything we needed to make a great stay. Brett was very friendly, there if you needed him, but unobtrusive if not."

Stayed a few nights","I am an avid skier and Beaver Creek is perhaps my favorite ski area in Colorado. Brett's place is in Edwards, a short distance from Avon. There's free parking in town (somewhat limited so get there early) and either the Skier Shuttle bus or the Gondola will get you to the ski area. When I go skiing I hit the slopes hard during the day and like coming back to a comfortable place where I can relax and cook for myself. Brett's place provides both, a nice gas fireplace and a full kitchen: full size fridge, oven, microwave, and dishwasher. Overall a very pleasant place to stay."

A five minute walk to the lift, with gear and kids in tow. I want to keep this place a secret given how wonderful it is. Great value for a ski in, ski out!

Stayed a few nights","A large common area with plenty of dishes and a great area to gather. The property is better suited for a family so some of the problem was with me in selecting it for two older couples. It was disappointing that we couldn’t locate the pool or hot tub with a short walk. Heated garage is a great luxury but don’t bring a second car. Host(s) we’re responsive but property needs closer attention as dryer bearing was going out and many switches are not connected to any lights. It was a nice, roomy property with lots of supplies. The property was basic, wouldn’t characterize as luxurious. It was a good price for the amount of space provided."

Group trip","Solid stay. Starting with the pros: the place is very large and has plenty of space. The pricing is really great for the area and the property is gorgeous. It was nice to have plenty of linens and the place was just easy. The managers were incredibly responsive and friendly when we reached out. The cons: the pool and hot tub are only open 10am-8pm (not super convenient if you're out doing things all day- but this is beyond the manager's control). The unit is somewhat dated, but comfortable and priced well below other units in the area. There are some things that are just getting old and need updating (the grill is rusted, broken, and unusable, the lights flicker on and off in the kitchen and there is a lack of lighting around the place, the fireplace was shut off- etc, the pullout sofa was hard to use....). Overall- definitely worth the price and the size of the unit and the responsiveness and friendliness of the host made the difference!"

The condo itself is a wonderful corner unit with amazing natural light from the huge windows in the living area. Spacious and comfortable.

Stayed with kids","BED BUGS. Stay away from this condo!
I got eaten alive the first night that we stayed in this unit (Sunday, September 4th, 2022) - 16 bites on one arm and 4 on the other. I slept in the master bedroom that night, alone, and was the only one to have bites. Unfortunately the bites surfaced late the next day, too late for us to check out and go elsewhere as we were traveling with a 2 year old. No one slept in the master bedroom the 2nd night.
I notified the hosts of the bed bug problem the next morning. They never even acknowledged my message. Then I reported it to AirBnb. They worked with me to get at least a partial refund, after sending them photos of the bites and a doctor’s note confirming they were bed bug bites. Everything about the bites was consistent with bed bugs. I am also all too familiar with them as this is the fourth time i have dealt with this in my life (the last time being over a decade ago).
Throughout all if this, the hosts never even acknowledged my message. I learned through AirBnb that they hired a pest control company to inspect the condo and they did not find any bed bugs. I don’t know how one would find them during the day in a condo covered in carpet and wood furniture. The only way to know for certain is if someone reports bites. You would have to completely tear apart a unit to find them as they can also live in the walls.
I appreciate AirBnb for working with me and for refunding at least the cleaning and service fees. I’ve lost several nights of sleep, endured excruciating bites, spent time with a doctor, and purchased prescription strength itch cream (these are way worse than mosquito bites). It’s now been 10 days since we checked out and my arms still look terrible although they feel considerably better. Not worth it for a 2-night stay in the mountains!! I would recommend staying at a hotel instead, which would at least have acknowledged the problem and likely refunded all of my money.
In addition, these hosts seem to be a group of three men who communicate different pieces of information about your stay. It’s disjointed and confusing. They send automated messages that are not accurate.
The best parts of our stay were the playgrounds across the street and the heated pool, which our toddler loved. These are community features though that serve multiple buildings, not just this condo building.
If you do consider staying at this unit, I would recommend asking to see documentation of full bed bug extermination (not just a report of inspection).
What an awful experience."

We were also provided an incorrect code to gain access to the garage and building. This was remedied but it did take about 15 minutes to get ahold of anyone to help. In general, response time was generally 1-2hrs, which could be improved.
Overall, the access to laundry, the location close to a shuttle and ski lift, the jetted hot tub, the comfortable beds (would recommend to bring your own pillow - the ones provided were not great), spacious living room with a fireplace, the and the large kitchen made it generally a very pleasant stay. We would stay again and have provided the hosts with specifics that could be improved to make it even better."

The heated parking garage with elevator straight into building was ideal for loading/unloading. It was an easy, slightly uphill, approx 3.5 minute walk to the lift. The heated pool and hot tub is a 2-3 min walk, so dress accordingly for the walk back. The hot tub was out of order for our stay but we heard it was getting worked on. Pool was open.
All in all, we really liked this condo and would definitely stay again."

Jeff’s place was so nice and cozy and well decked out compared to other Airbnb sites, this is the only place I’ve stayed at in the past few years that deserves a 5. The others should be 4’s. What a great stay. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Was worried about staying in Edwards and skiing at Vail but it was no issue at all. Just need a car! Thanks!"

When we contacted the host he said there wasn't A/C and the listing had been changed. There is very limited cookware and what was there has seen its better days. It was approximately 75-80° in the unit and didn't cool off that much during the night. This place is listed as luxury, but don't be fooled. It is not luxury. It is located in a gated community with a country club inside the gates. The apartment is no where near luxury."

Stayed one night","First off, I stayed at many ski-resort condos in the 1990s and 2000s. We were rather disappointed with the Edwards condo. First of all, the directions provided were difficult to follow. On our first trip in, we asked the security guard for a parking hangtag but he said we didn’t need it. The second time, we needed to talk to the (different) guard and finally got a hangtag. It would have been helpful for the guard station to have been told in advance that we were authorized and expected, especially as I did not recognize that the listing was in a gated community until after booking.
Once we entered the condo, we did not find any directions for guests, how to do common tasks such as adjusting the AC, or what to do at checkout. The master bedroom had a stained duvet cover, no clock or wastebasket (certainly essential in the time of Covid), no chair or other place to put small objects, and feeble lighting. The mattress and pillows were quite uncomfortable, with the memory foam unevenly worn. The presence of a pack of toilet seat covers on the HP printer was quite odd. The wireless internet network name and password were provided with incorrect capitalization. The wrong network name could have connected us to a hacker, and the wrong password simply didn’t work.
In the morning we noticed that two doors leading to the outside were not locked. None of us opened these doors, so we suspect they had not been locked before our arrival. In short, we believe that the price we paid for an off-season rental was way too steep."

Stayed one night","The group I was in communicated with Jeff about an early check in and everything was good! He was very friendly. However, when I booked the stay I immediately noticed from the address that his location was not in Aspen - where we had searched / planned to stay. I immediately canceled (this all happened within a 10 min time frame). I contacted Airb&b support for a full refund since it was a genuine mistake but Jeff kept the entire $170. A genuine mistake costed me $170 and he has not responded to AirB&B efforts to contact him to issue a full refund.
Although I do see his cancellation policy, it’s saddening that people are this money hungry. I thought he was in Aspen, his location is not AFTER the fact. The least he could have done was provide a 75% refund. I can’t expect others to have the same morals as me, I’m sure he is a decent host I was just surprised by his lack of empathy regarding my situation."

Great playground right across the road for younger kids and easy access to hiking trails too. The condo was a ground-floor corner unit and quite spacious with a big kitchen. We enjoyed the two balconies as well. Clean and well-kept with nice homey touches. Great building with ski lockers and underground heated parking. Hosts were easy to communicate with and responsive to questions. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","There weren’t any reviews when we booked so we were a little nervous but the place was a great value for the money. It is about a block and half downhill from the lift which is a bit of a hike in ski boots but it was doable. The village of Arrowhead is small but we really enjoyed the free shuttle that takes you to Bachelor Gulch and Beaver Creek.
The condo itself is very spacious, the beds were comfortable and it had everything we needed. There’s a coffee maker, lots of pots and pans and large table to play games, along with a PS4 with games and tv and a washer/dryer. You’ll need to bring your own spices if you want anything besides salt/pepper. They did have oil and coffee.
We were disappointed about the hot tubs being closed but that’s no fault of the owners. We did enjoy the large bath tub after a long day on the slopes. The hosts were very responsive and accommodated all our requests."

Easy access to starting a ski day at Arrowhead and heated garage with ability to have your car in was money!! Highly recommend for a family with adult children.

Tara had quick, kind communication and we were so happy with the experience. Also, Edwards is beyond stunning in the fall and the home was close to many places to explore and Vail too. Thank you Tara!"

The kitchen is very well stocked , and has large island that makes cooking for a group easy . Back patio is nice and we saw wildlife almost everyday . There is a city market right at the bottom of the hill that has everything you could possibly need , there is also a Starbucks and lots of shops and restaurants. Location was great , easy and quick to get to vail or beaver creek , we did the East lake creek trail ( with infant and 3yo) and it was lovely and only ten min from the house . The place was very clean , beds were comfy and water pressure was good , definitely recommend!"

I was extremely disappointed as we had done so much research into where we wanted to stay before booking. She had great reviews, but did not hold up to the standard we expected from them. We also had 2 different cars pull up to blatantly watch us starting at 7am until check out. We felt very uncomfortable for our entire stay with doing no wrong. Also, you would think for $550 a night you would have air conditioning. Embarrassing."

The upstairs master has a large closet which fits a pack and play perfectly, a bonus for us. And the basement provided a great place for the older children to play (plenty of toys are in the closet) and sleep.
We used the grill (gas, attached to a gas line) and bonfire pit quite a bit. The kitchen has ample cooking pots, pans & utensils.
The check in instructions were clear and easy. I had a few questions for Tara and she responded quickly. If we return to the Edwards area in the future I would not hesitate to book this house again.
Thank you for letting us stay at your place Tara."

The backyard patio was such a nice treat to grill up some burgers in the day and roast some marshmallows in the fire pit at night. There was only 1 issue that we were not able to resolve ourselves. We were unable to figure out how to make the water come out of the shower head. It was really no big deal for us since there are 3 other showers, but other than that everything was amazing. Thank you so much! Will be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is just a hop, skip and a jump from the Riverwalk in Edwards. It’s literally across the street to the south and up the hill a quarter mile at most. It has a ton of room and if you have children, there are bunk beds in the basement. It’s a 2 story house with a basement that is finished. It feels like you’re a bit out in nature and you are also very close to the action. It was very clean and has all the amenities you need. The bathrooms are a little smaller than you might think, but that’s just the style when the house was built. The patio on main level in the back is a nice touch. Overall, I would stay there again for sure."

Stayed with kids","The house was just perfect for our annual Friendtrip. It was clean, well-decorated, and cozy. No detail was missed- there were hair dryers in all the bathrooms, lovely toiletries, and beautiful decor. The gas fireplace was perfect for our first night- it was quite cold and rainy- but the fireplace warmed us up in no time! This house was a great place for kids, too- books for bedtime stories, awesome nooks and crannies for hide and seek, and a whole drawer of kids plates and cups in the kitchen. The kitchen had everything we needed and was spacious enough to have many cooks prepping food. Plus there was tons of pantry storage for our stock of snacks for the week. Our group of 11 had plenty of space to dine together. We loved the patio; the umbrella was great for the warm afternoon sun and the fire pit was perfect for s'mores. The grill had all the tools we needed for a night of brats and burgers, too. We caught glimpses of deer in the yard almost every morning and evening and even spotted a few rainbows during our stay. The en suite bathrooms in every bedroom were so nice- made it so much easier to get everyone ready each morning. The location was great- super close to town, an easy drive to Vail, the grocery store and several parks. A delicious bagel place was a short walk down the hill and several restaurants we enjoyed (the Craftsman, Gore Range Brewery, Hovey and Harrison, and the Smiling Moose) were just minutes away. This was easily one of our favorite rentals. Couldn't have asked for a better experience at Tara's Edwards house! Thanks, Tara, for giving us a great space to make some wonderful memories!!"

We don’t like the traditional log homes that are very dark and often not child friendly. This home is a great space for families. The Edwards neighborhood is warmer, less touristy and much better value than central vail. Shops and restaurants are within walking distance and the neighborhood is quiet with lots of deer roaming around. Nice back patio and fire pit. Great for a long term visit with friends and family."

The open floor plan is such a perfect space for large families/groups and the outdoor fire pit is a great way to end a long day on the slopes. The kitchen is well stocked with the essentials and any coffee paraphernalia you could ever need (i.e. we loved making cappuccinos with the Mukka). Bunk bed comfort in the basement might be more suitable for children. Thanks so much to Tara for a great stay! Hope to return soon!"

This did not bother us as the kitchen, bathrooms, and linens were very clean and the place fit our needs well. The pool area was great, and being so close to but not right at the resorts was perfect for us."

Stayed a few nights","Jeff’s place was clean and accurate in what we expected. However, there were quite a few things that were unexpected. We have rented multiple Airbnb’s and have never had an owners personal things like clothes openly visible in the closet and accessible. It is more of a bachelors pad feel including the “cheeky” underwear flag hanging in the bathroom. Not an issue with us but could be for a younger family or another guest. Some kitchen items were missing including the coffee carafe, sponge to clean the dishes and bathtub stopper in one of the bathrooms. The managers did respond very quickly to replacing the coffee maker and we just made do with the other things. very dated. Some of the stove burners didn’t work and were not seated properly. We simply decided not to complain since we skied two days and didn’t want to make arrangements to fix everything. All in all, it was a decent stay but could have been much better."

Stayed about a week","Four years since we last visited Edwards and Jeff’s place worked out great for us. It has a wonderful view of the river and the mountains. It has nice easy access and is close, but not in the downtown business area, which we found to be a plus. The living area was spacious and comfortable for my husband and I. Our stay was for seven days so we did use all the appliances. The stacking laundry unit worked great and was easy to use. The dishwasher has some miles on it but when run on “pots & pans” mode did a good job of cleaning.
Our contact Randy went out of his way for us with our extra parking that we needed. During our stay we had a couple of questions with TV operation and an issue with a neighbor making some noise a little late in the afternoon for our liking, Randy was available and responsive right away taking care of the noise problem and answering our TV questions.
Our hosts provided plenty of clean and fluffy towels. We found the bed comfortable and the feather comforter kept us warm and cozy for our late November visit.
Hoping we get back to Edwards again one day and will definitely contact Jeff and Randy to book our stay."

Will definitely look up her place the next time I get out there

Stayed about a week","Julie is a super host!! Communication with her was always easy and fast. Correct check-in & check-out.
The house is amazing, large and comfortable.
Fantastic room and private bathroom, very spacious everything. The bed is very comfortable, with winter sheets, several pillows and several blankets available apart from the comforter. Great closet and dresser to place clothes. There is a good fridge in the room which is great!! The perfect heating temperature. There is a humifier to counteract the dry air of the heater (95% of the houses in the USA have air heating). The perfect shower and hot water, also has a hair dryer.
Exquisite cleanliness, everything's super clean.
We were able to use the kitchen, which has been a very important plus to us.
Location is also perfect if you are going skiing, as has been in our case. 6 minutes from the nearest Beavier Creek lift and 15 minutes from Vail by car. Edwards is connected to the ski resorts via several bus lines, but it would take you longer (to Vail 52 minutes).
Definitely the best quality/price option in the entire Vail Valley. I recommend it without any doubt."

Stayed a few nights","A wonderful retreat, is the TLDR version of this review.
In a once in a blue moon accident, in a flash, the entire power grid in the town was shut off. A city-wide blackout. While we panicked trying to find candles and flashlights we were greeted by a friendly knock not even five minutes into the blackout. Our lovely host checked-in on us and graciously provided flashlights to use.
If there is no other way to say that we had a calm and restful retreat, I'm not sure how else to put it. During our stay we never worried about anything and felt right at home...for the duration our PTO allowed us at least."

Kaleb and Abby were very available and accommodating but not at all intrusive. We didn’t even know they were there until they were right away available to answer questions.

The Airbnb is clean, well-furnished, and comfortable. It's in a very quiet neighborhood. We had a relaxing trip. I highly recommend their Airbnb."

Stayed with a pet","Kaleb & Abby are great hosts and I would 100% stay with them again. Kaleb gave great advice on places to visit (even with our upcoming trip to AZ). Their place was very clean and accurate to the description on Airbnb. My partner & I especially loved when Piper the dog came to hang out with our two dogs. The yard is great to let the pups run around, or to lay out and get some sun. The stars are beautiful and shining bright at night as well! Thank you for being great hosts to my family!"

Stayed over a week","“The Ritz of Eagle, CO!”
Simply the best time possible in the Vail Valley. Whether we were skiing the resorts, hiking, fly fishing, you name it, this was the single best place we could have possibly stayed. Kaleb and Abby are phenomenal hosts. Such great amenities. Lots of advice and benefits, including how to snow mobile, snowshoe, and do any and all things outdoors. Their place is close to the ECO bus stop, with a Park & Ride, the local grocery store, and the Eagle River. 20 mins to BC, 30 mins to Vail, and less than 10 mins to EGE airport. 11/10 stay. A+ on all counts. Will try and stay with them again!"

My wife and I got settled, and an hour later, Kaleb came by to introduce himself, and his wife Abby. Their dog , a rescue from the Navajo Reservation, awesome, had come by earlier to say hi. He offered up restaurant recommendations (Kaleb, not the dog), and any additional kitchen gadgets we may want. He's a foodie. Clean interior, comfortable bed, great value, great communication, would stay again."

Couldn't ask for better communication from a host. Super responsive and helpful. Provided lots of information about the area of things we were interested in.

There was a “take a bottle leave a bottle” wine rack, fairy lights along the path to the door, personal touches all around... even the toilet paper was shaped into a rose. Oh... and the beautiful mountain view right in the backyard wasn’t so bad either!!! Haha. This place was awesome, the host.. even more so.

It was like staying with good friends along with the perfect balance of privacy and impromptu conversations out in the yard. The place was as described and shown in the pics. It's in a great location, convenient to great hiking, outdoor adventures, and a day trip to Aspen."

The location was incredible as it was in super close proximity to outdoor adventures. Kaleb/ Abby were really great at local recommendations, which was very helpful as we had limited time to explore after we finished our remote workday.
They were incredibly generous and it made this stay worth every second! We hope to return one day. Definitely stay here!"

Stayed one night","Lovely, cozy unit downstairs from the main house, not far from the 70 but also close to the lovely little town of Eagle. No stairs to get into the unit but the driveway hill is a bit steep and there are stones to walk over before you get into the unit (if you have any unsteadiness). We were just making a quick stop in a cross-country trip so we didn't have the chance to enjoy the natural beauty and recreation opportunities, but the presence of hummingbirds around the property, and the lovely view, were appreciated."

They are close to town, but also far out so you feel very secluded and can enjoy the mountian views. Kaleb and Abby were super helpful when it came to giving us suggestions on what to do in the surrounding area, and just very nice and accommodating in general. I highly reccomend this place to anyone!"

Dinner in Eagle at Boneyard was a hit, and the 30 min proximity west of the mountain made for traffic free arrivals and departures.

What better than that post surgery? His instructions were crystal clear and even though the elevator had a small mechanical issue it was up and running in no time. I think that would not be the case if I was dealing with those large management companies. This is a very nice place and you deal with a family that loves their place in a little slice of heaven. There are plenty of walkable places like restaurants, food market and theaters. My only regret will be that I was not able to enjoy all the amenities as I was on crutches. We will be back and ready to run. Highly recommended!"

The living area was very comfortable and homey, and there was a deck with a lovely river view. We slept with the window open and had the lovely sound of the river as background music We did not use the kitchen, but had we needed to it had everything we could have needed.

It was equipped with everything we needed, and it’s so nice to be so close to Riverwalk, restaurants, shopping, the bus to beaver creek, and the walking path right out the door. It’s a five minute drive to the arrowhead chairlift as well. It’s right on the river and you can hear it peacefully at night!
Thank you for such a great vacation spot. We hope to be back!"

We stayed at David’s place for 4 nights and had an awesome trip. To give you an idea about how awesome this location is, we got out of the garage (a huge plus in snow season) and got to the ski lift within 20 minutes! That’s including putting on skis and walking from the (free) lot to the lift! The living space itself is perfect and beautiful. We will definitely be booking this place when we come back if it’s available. Half based on the location and space itself and half based on how helpful and awesome David was!"

The condo itself backs up to a rushing river which lulled us to sleep at night through our open windows. The balcony also overlooks the river and was an peaceful spot for evening toddies and morning coffee.
The kitchen is stocked with everything we needed to cook meals, the beds were comfy, the couch deep and firm—great for watching tv and afternoon naps. The bedrooms are on opposite ends of the layout, allowing for privacy. Same goes for the bathrooms.
And—clean! The unit was sparkling clean. The host was super helpful and communicative. We would for sure come back and stay at the Stellar!"

He was very helpful and promptly responded to any questions I had. Thank you, David, for a great getaway!"

Plenty of sleeping space with a bunk bed and queen bed in each bedroom. The proximity to skiing makes this an ideal place to stay during skiing season. We stayed in August which made for a wonderful scenic view of the creek situated directly behind the condo.
Choosing this condo would be a great choice!!!!"

Group trip","We had a perfect stay at this Airbnb. The house is beautifully situated on a hillside looking over stunning Colorado wilderness. We saw multiple wild animals including elk and deer in the mornings. The house is clean, perfectly laid out, and boasts a well equipped kitchen (2 sinks!). Each evening we gathered in the dining room and the large den area to play board games after epic ski days at Vail and Beaver Creek. The hot tub works great and the location is terrific for exploring the surrounding area.
I would be remiss to exclude praise for the extremely responsive and accommodating management team. They helped part of our group access the property early and were attentive to our questions (9x12 pans for lasagna?) and messages throughout the period before and after our stay. This management team really stood out and we will try to book here first next time we stay in the area!"

Stayed with kids","The space in terms of bedrooms, size, sleeping arrangements , options etc was great for our group of 10. The communication with the mgmt company was also great. House was clean and had plenty of bedding & linens. The garage space was large & able to hold full size truck.
The property itself needs a bit of a refresh - looks like it has been rented a lot. The mattresses were older and have toppers on them. Kitchen supplies were adequate - not great if planning to cook a lot. Also no fault of hosts but there was a group of wild cats that would try to get in house all the time and get you when accessing hot tub.
Overall family had a great time during our stay in Edwards."

Started out our first day in the mid 50’s and wasn’t at a true hot tub temp until the 3rd afternoon. Used it as a lukewarm tub the first 2 days. Great place to stay if you’re there in the winter and trying to go to Vail or Beaver Creek. Nice setup for what we needed just really disappointed about the hot tub the first two days. Beautiful mountain backdrop looking out the back with trails to use.

The beds are very comfy, the water pressure was great, and there was plenty of hot water for everyone. The view is spectacular, and having the hot tub and sauna after a day on the slopes is a dream come true.
There were a couple of maintenance issues (a cabinet door fell off and the back of a dining chair started falling apart), but the management company was very responsive and offered to repair or replace these things right away. The kitchen has most of the essentials but if you need something particular you may need to bring it. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","Great location, big spacious home in a gorgeous neighborhood, good floor plan, with access to shops and stores. But home really needs an update. Finishes and furniture feel out of date.
The home is in a great location, in a beautiful neighborhood. There is access to a trail system right behind the house, with great views of the mountains and surrounding area. There are walking trails all around the neighborhood. The home has great outdoor space, a big back yard, a hot tub, and a sauna. The neighborhood apparently has quiet hours which I understand but restricting hot tub use to 9pm on weekdays and 10pm on weekends seems excessive. The owner has likely had issues with people making a lot of noise and I assume has had to make these restrictions.
The neighborhood location is great, with good access to shops and stores and quick access to highway.
The home has a great floor plan and is very spacious. The garage is heated. Upstairs is the mud room, office area, kitchen, dining area, living room, and master bedroom and bathroom which is large and spacious as well. The master has great views out into the mountains
Downstairs is 4 bedrooms and two full bathrooms as well as another living room, and access to the backyard."

I understand that trash needs to be in garage due to wildlife but it was very smelly. Having a garage to park in was nice especially if you were to be there in the winter.

We traveled 20 minutes to get to Eagle to bike and 20 minutes to get to Vail Village for dinner, concert and GoPro games. The apartment was clean and comfortable!"

The only downside, I'd say, is the lack of natural light - this is definitely a basement apartment and it can feel a little ""closed in"". That being said, it is spacious and comfortable and for the price - it can't be beat."

It was nice having a private garage for the car and it just felt like we were in a little apartment! The host was great at messaging me back and gave great tips on places to eat in Vail! It was just the two of us on a girls trip, but a whole family could easily stay there with the amount of room available! 10/10 would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Michael’s place is a great choice for couples or small parties who are wanting to stay in the eagle county/vail area. It is very spacious, and has all the amenities one could ask for, including a; washer/dryer, kitchen, fridge, garage, heated fireplace, Netflix on the tv, toaster, WiFi, and 2 beds in the bedroom. The location is great as you are roughly 30 minutes from the airport and about 20 minutes from vail. For the price and location, this may be one of the best options for anyone on a budget.
The unit does look like the pictures as advertised, but it wasn’t as clean as we had hoped for. The floor was dusty, had what looked like some dried mud, food, and other debris, which was disappointing. The towels also were stained a bit. The noise from the toilet was quite loud, sometimes going off in the night. We did have a problem with the toilet, it stopped working and started leaking, but Michael promptly fixed it while we were out.
Overall this place is a good choice if you want decent quality for a good price. The unit could use some touching up, as it really has the potential to be one of the nicest places in the area. I would recommend for anyone wanting to go for a ski vacation who cannot afford the $500 a night resorts."

Stayed a few nights","Really cute and spacious basement apartment! Having the garage as the entrance was great for bringing our stuff in and letting our snowboards dry. The bed and blankets were super comfortable and the living room area was very cozy. There was a space heater if we needed it. The TV had a guest Netflix account available for use which was very convenient.
The kitchenette had a full fridge, sink, dishwasher, two electric burners, microwave, and coffee maker. When I tried to use the electric burners and coffee maker at the same time (different outlets) it tripped the breaker so I’d use just one appliance at a time.
The water pumps are a bit loud when using the toilet or any running water, but not bad at all. We could hear movement from our hosts above during the day, but not at all disruptive (like living in an apartment) and very quiet at night.
About 15 minutes from Beaver Creek and Vail parking lots, great location."

Group trip","An amazing space with a super responsive and helpful host, who responded immediately to all messages! We had problems with the fuses but Michael helped us reset the correct ones, and the space was super clean and tidy and comfortable for 4 people. We parked in the garage so our ski gear was safe, and the host generously provided us a space heater and 3 tide pods so we could dry our ski boots and do laundry. What’s great too is that the grocery store is super close, so we were able to grab some dish soap for scrubbing before placing dishes in the dishwasher as the previous soap was low. As a tip, We brought our own shampoo and body wash and precooked meals. I’d recommend pre-cooking portions of big meals before coming; the portable stove top has one big burner and one small burner which is great for simple meals like canned soup, but not so great if you’re trying to cook from scratch for 4 people. There was one large metal pan and one ceramic pot, I’d bring a larger pasta pot or precooked pasta like we did. There is a Queen and then a twin XL in the bedroom, the twin is creaky so our sound-sensitive friend slept on the couch (not even the pull out bed) and was very comfortable!! Overall we were very pleased with our stay, and recommend Michael and his unit as a great option for people checking out the epic pass resorts! We were 10-15 min from Beaver and 20 min from Vail."

Michaels communication was amazing! He was so quick to respond. His place would be perfect for a mini getaway."

Stayed a few nights",This location is ideal for Beaver Creek resort if your plans are skiing or other outdoor activities in this area. Michael’s place is recently updated/renovated and clean. We had one set of questions after check in and owner was fast to respond/address any concerns. Location is a bottom unit of a multi-unit building.

Stayed with kids","Michael is a lovely host and his place is located in a great place with easy access to skiing and shopping. This is a basement, behind a working garage and no natural light. It feels like a cave but a pretty one."

Stayed one night",A great little spot to make home base for your adventures in the area! The garage access is great during winter and makes dealing with gear and weather much easier. Nice sized bedroom with two big beds and the small kitchenette and living room are just enough to unwind and refuel.

Stayed one night","Michael was very helpful and responded quickly to messages. The place is in a convenient location, is very spacious, and includes everything you will need for your stay (silverware, dishes, towels, soap, etc.). It was clean and neatly decorated. Being able to utilize the one car garage is also a plus, especially for when it snows."

Stayed one night","Lovely house on the basement level with a garage. It’s only 15 mins from Vail village and 8-10 to Avon and Beaver Creek. The room is huge and so is the king size bed, which was very comfortable. Very cute decor and the apartment gets warm very quickly. Only complaint is that you can hear EVERYTHING from upstairs. Every conversation, music, tv, etc. and at night time If you’re a light sleeper the noise from the pipes or heating unit (not sure which one it was) is very loud. It sounds like someone is knocking on the door all night but it’s just the click clack of the pipes. I have a white noise app on my phone so we just turned it on all night but if you don’t then the noise might keep you up."

Thanks to Michael and Eileen for being great hosts and thank you for the special wine bottle we had at our arrival. It was perfect to receive the new year. THANK YOU! We’ll be back!"
