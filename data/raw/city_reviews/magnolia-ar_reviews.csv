Stayed with kids","It was everything my boyfriend wanted and more during his escape from the hustle and bustle of hauling concrete in DFW. My son had NO ANXIETY which was a blessing he is a 3yr old with ASD. The pictures, the decor, it feels like a home that was steeped in love throughout the years, truly. We wished we could have spent more time enjoying the home than visiting family. Amazing hosts! Amazing job! We are still in awe at how it checked every box on the list of things we wanted and needed for our short getaway. Thank you Beverlee and Keith your home was truly a home to us."

This cottage would standout in any setting! The amenities were just what we needed for such a family trip as this ... spacious, quiet, full kitchen and multiple bathrooms. I would rate Beverlee's listing a 4.7/5, will definitely recommend and look forward to returning for another stay."

Stayed a few nights","From the moment I opened the side door off the car port of Killgore Cottage I was in awe. Attention to decore, ambience and cleanliness were immediately apparent. On a stifling Louisiana day the house was enticingly cool with AC and ceiling fans running. As I moved through the house lamps provided a dimly lit path revealing a collection of vintage treasures and the overhead light switches. It was apparent I was both expected and being invited in.
As a lone traveller I felt safe in Killgore cottage and in the residential neighborhood I temporarily joined.
I found it ideally situated for my purpose and during the hottest part of the August days a welcoming retreat.
From condiments to soaps and cleaning supplies so many extras were provided.
I left Haynesville contentedly knowing I have a cozy Louisiana home to return to on my next visit.
Beverlee and Keith are amazing hosts; they’re friendly and welcoming, very responsive to communication and considerate of guest privacy."

Stayed a few nights","I cant say more! It was a pleasure to come back to the cottage every day! This place was the second best part of a miserable trip and weather! (Seeing my son was first best!). I’m from Ecuador, and had sticker shock daily on this trip! But the cottage felt worth the money during a trip that I may not be able to make again! I’m 76 yrs old, and the trip from Ecuador was really hard. But Beverly and the good people of Haynesville gave me peace and comfort❤️ thank you! Thanks to Jimmy Dale Williams too 🥰

It was truly special to stay in Haynesville, the home of our ancestors, and being able to stay in this wonderful home with all the amenities one could ever think to need, with the additional feeling of true Southern living, well, it doesn't get any better than that! So any other descendants of Haynesville or anyone visiting Northern Louisiana - this is a must stay! Beverlee ... you 've done your town proud! Thank you from all of us - we will definitely be back!"

You feel at home immediately and meeting the owner and mayor of the town and chatting was an added bonus. We couldn't have been happier with our time in this lovely home. We even got to know the mail man!
For families with a little one; a special room is close to the Master. The third bedroom is large and all the house is decorated very nicely! Very clean! Perfect!"

Stayed with kids","This is a super cute, recently remodeled, fully stocked for a long term stay, three bedroom home, located about 2 blocks from a park and almost in the middle of the tiny town. The front porch is perfect for sipping your favorite beverage and watching the neighbors drive by. The screened in back porch is shaded by a large tree and presents a relaxed place to contemplate. The large back yard, shaded by the same tree is a wonderful place to do yoga & watch the neighborhood birds. Basically everyone is friendly and will wave at you as you sit on the porch, walk around town, or talk to you if you run into them at the Piggly Wiggly. There are a handful of restaurants in town one can support. The downtown area has great potential. I personally feel that if the town had a few festivals during the year, perhaps a farmers market (not sure if I missed one), got the downtown spiced up with perhaps local artists, farmers, beekeepers, lemonade stands..whatever the peoples talents are, this town could be even more amazing. From this cute home to the church bells ringing throughout the day to the trains that slowly pass thru town, occasionally blowing their whistles, & the wonderful people. You may just want to stay longer. : )"

Stayed with a pet","A very nice place. Quiet and peaceful. We were in town for a family funeral. It was very nice to get away from everyone and have a whole house alone. The house is not far from restaurants or town, but far enough that you feel like you are away from everything. The house is clean with plenty of room. The toys and games provided where wonderful for the two youngest children and the wifi was fast and kept my oldest occupied. Would recommend to anyone visiting from out of town needing a place to get away and be their own for any trip."

Stayed with kids","We didn’t get to spend much time here, we checked in after midnight. The house was ready for us when we got there. Plenty of room for our family at five. Before we left, my husband and kids were able to explore a little of the yard. There are neighboring dogs (fenced) that were very friendly. My kids loved on them through the fence. Simple instructions for when checking out, common courtesy expectations. Take the trash, turn lights off and place the thermostat back to the starting temp."

Group trip","We were in town for Family Day at SAU and were not able to secure a hotel room so we decided to check out Air B&B in the area and we are so glad we did. The Rafters is exactly what we needed! Cory and Christie were such wonderful hosts! We had six people staying so we brought our own air mattress to use as an extra bed (there are two bedrooms, each with a queen bed) but upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find that Christie had put up an extra twin bed as well as a queen size air mattress and had made the beds for us as well. The kitchen was well equipped with coffee, creamer, sugar, etc. which was also very nice. The apartment was conveniently located, very clean and cute. Our 14 month old grandson also enjoyed watching the chickens out the back door. We will definitely be staying here again when we go back to SAU to visit our granddaughter."

The Airbnb home I stayed in was lovely, with all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The hosts were very hospitable and helpful. I particularly enjoyed exploring Southern Arkansas University, which had a beautiful campus and a rich history.
Overall, I highly recommend Magnolia, Arkansas as a destination for anyone looking to experience southern hospitality and charm. I had a great time and can't wait to return!"

Cory and Christie are great, friendly people.
It’s a cute private place. Covered parking and entry in back. The house is as described and pictured in the ad. It’s reasonably priced but a deal if you split it with a second couple.
Backyard bbq is good food. One brisket sandwich would have been plenty for the two of us. We’ll have to try the ribs next time.
We will stay again."

The outside looked like a commercial office building and included covered parking. The inside was bigger than I expected! It had 2 nice sized bedrooms and a bathroom. Full kitchen and living room with a big screen TV with Netflix. The WiFi worked well and we were very comfortable in this cozy place. The bed we stayed in was so comfortable we slept all night and did not wake up in pain. The bath towels were super fluffy and every detail that was included was so well enjoyed. We really felt like we were at home away from home. Would definitely recommend!

Stayed with kids","The Rafters was well suited for our family of 4.
We wanted to get out of town and sort of randomly chose Magnolia. The place is easy to find, the only downside to that is that you'll hear road noise.
The kitchen was really well stocked, I made a mini Thanksgiving meal easily, then we chilled out in the recliners.
Logoly State Park had nice trails and the stop at The Flying Burger in the way back into town was a good pit stop.
The beds were comfortable, lovely bedding, etc."

So close to down town! The house is beautiful and unique inside! I love that they used many of the original buildings features like the beams and floors. The beds and pillows were very comfortable! We never ran out of hot water even with 5 showering. They have everything you need for your stay and then some! I was thankful for the extra touches like cold bottles of water and laundry soap. They had games and dvds plus Netflix, cable and I think Amazon prime. They had a contactless check in that was nice since we arrived late that night. They were very friendly and offered to help with anything we needed! Oh and it was spotless! We highly recommend them and hope to stay again one day!"

Stayed a few nights","I traveled to town to participate in an organized bike ride held in Magnolia as a fundraiser for a local non-profit. I was very pleased to find that the Rafters was available as it is just blocks from my event location, enabling me to ride my bike to and from the event without having to load up the car and park, etc.. The space is very clean and modern, with all the amenities you might expect such full kitchen and bathroom supplies. Beds were very comfortable as well as the living room furniture. Parking was private and covered away from the street, which is very nice during the hot summer, sunny months of south Arkansas. If you're seeking a nice place to stay in town, this is worth your consideration."

Stayed a few nights","Our trip could not have been better. We were in Magnolia for our youngest sons wedding. This was our first experience with AirBNB and it was wonderful. Instead of a hotel room for several days I booked our stay at this great apartment. It was a fabulous place, it is super clean, fully stocked with great linens and a washer and dryer and the bed was ""absolutely the most comfortable bed I have slept in away from home"". Cory and his lovely wife were very accommodating as we had extra stuff to drag in for the wedding. We were super busy while we were there and were constantly in and out, everything in town is very convenient, even made a quick trip to have the nails and toes done, about 3 mins from the apartment. We had family & friends that dropped by for a visit and it was so nice to be able to relax and visit instead of being in a hotel lobby!!! I would definitely give this place 5 Stars, it is A Wonderful Place to Stay. We will be back and certainly will book with them again."

Stayed with kids","Corey and Christie's place was perfect for our family of 5 (this includes our 2 fur babies)! We also had our 7-month old niece over for a night. Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Check in was a breeze, communication was effortless and the home was much more spacious than we'd anticipated. Matter of fact, we were expecting an apartment but what we got was more of a duplex-two-family home, and quite stylish with lots of thoughtful extra touches. There were plenty of comfy plush towels, and the place was immaculately clean. Normally, I don't book Airbnb stays where the owner lives on property due to my desire for absolute privacy. However, I never would've known the owners lived next door had they not mentioned it. We were given all of the autonomy needed to enjoy the space as our own. The outside seating area was a fantastic plus with a basketball goal our 7-year old son and his 6-year old cousin thoroughly enjoyed. The waterfall and Zen garden were perfect for our morning mediations, and the guidebook provided by the hosts was extremely helpful and saved us lots of time when ordering in.
The only thing I'd say is the car wash next door can get a little loud throughout the day and late at night. However, traveling from the city (New York) to the south, you don't consider that real noise. Needless to say, we slept right through it! Someone looking for a bit more silence may not feel the same.
We loved our stay so much that we extended it for another night and would undoubtedly return for another visit."

The place itself was fantastic. It was very clean and comfortable. The bedrooms and bath had nice individual touches that made them distinct, but were still functional and very comfortable. Shower pressure is a big deal to me, and I was not disappointed!
The kitchen and living area were open and allowed us to talk while one was preparing dinner and the other relaxing with Netflix.
Also, being a southerner, AC is essential and the home stayed cool on the 90+ degree days were were there.
Cory and his family have created a pleasant and peaceful place to rest, relax, and enjoy a bit of small town life and hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","It's very rustic bed & breakfast vibe minus onsite owners. Has 4 separate rooms with own bathroom with one being a family suite. Little kitchen and family room. It's like a shared apartment where you feel like it's ok to not lock your doors. Two flights of stairs, easy to manage. Heather is amazing and helped my family when visiting from OH for a family funeral when there was a mixup in our reservations with another hotel. She was able to book us a room and relieved of us a very stressful situation. She may not have realized she also booked other family members from out of town as well. We enjoyed our stay and if ever back in Magnolia will definitely try to stay here again. Thank you!"

There were a couple of dirty washcloths overlooked, and the bathroom did not seem to get a good cleaning, but nothing we couldn’t wipe down. There were a couple of stains on a couple of the blankets, but again, just an oversight I would think. The kids and I had plenty of room and it was nice to be about to walk around the square without having to drive anywhere else."

This was my first time using Airbnb, and I was not expecting the addition of a cleaning fee or Airbnb fee. Obviously this is not the Host fault but with the way the App advertises the properties. Airbnb should show all fees associated with the rental at the beginning of the search.
I would definitely recommend this host and property to any future customers."

It was close to the airport where we would be training and centrally located to everything we would need. We shopped at the Piggly Wiggly and Walmart, but there is a Brookshire grocery store just a block down the road. Her home had a kitchen where we would make our meals, a washer and dryer where we would do our laundry, and WiFi so that we could access the internet. Also, in the family room, there was a TV attached to some streaming services where we could watch movies after a long day of training."

Stayed a few nights","Bit of a creepy house. I know it's an older one, which is totally fine, but there are 2 areas of just crawl spaces that have furniture covering them. I wish that was made known before my stay.
It honestly felt like the perfect place to murder the guests and then sell their belongings at the auction house across the street.
It really smells awful inside. We left a thing a fabreeze for the next guest. Not to sound dramatic but I had to wash my clothes twice back at home before I could get the lingering smell out of them.
Generally cleanish, but not the type of place I would pay for again. It is definitely better than the 2 motels in the town though.
I'd suggest upgrading the house, putting a bathroom near the main bedroom, and getting a professional cleaner to clean everything thoroughly. It was clear the owner cleans it themselves.
Please please cover/get rid of the creepy crawl spaces."

Stayed with a pet",Peggy and Paul were one of the best hosts we have ever encountered using Airbnb. They were so friendly and kind. This place is a hidden gem. I got our check in date mixed up and Peggy came as fast as she could to accommodate my silly mistake and give us a key for entry. We also decided to stay another day and there was no issues with that either. I can not recommend this place enough! My daughter is an animal lover and Peggy and Paul even let us come down to the farm to pet one of their sweet cows. The place was clean - exactly like the pictures! The outside shower was a nice and relaxing touch. 10/10! We will definitely be back.

In our electronic world, this makes a mommas heart smile. We lit a fire, made smores, and the kiddos played horseshoes. My little one was sad to leave. The cows are a beautiful off the front porch. And to say the least, I have never had owners have so much communication with you. They made us feel like family! Thank you so much for sharing this little peace of heaven with us."

My bath had bubbles waiting on me and s’mores ready to be cooked and ate! I got to pet Molly their friendly cow, and check out their amazing ranch! My tip to staying here is stay much longer than you expected because you’re not gonna want to leave!"

Very very clean and safe and you won’t starve because Brian has goodies that would fancy anyone’s craving until you feel like going to the store…"

Not only did our host greet us and conversate with us, but he stocked the house with breakfast foods, beverages, and snacks. It was so clean and refreshing when we walked in. The only drawback was that we were there for a funeral and didn't get a chance to enjoy having a place away from home.

Michelle not only provided a beautiful place for us to stay but a cute little gift basket with all sorts of goodies for the girls and I. I have stayed at many Air BNB’s but this was by far my favorite.
The master bath is beautiful, the living room is nice and cozy and the entire house is in a private but beautiful little part of land. It was the perfect place to sit on the front porch and have a cup of coffee while doing a devotional. 10/10 stay for sure."

Stayed one night","We decided to stay since we were in Magnolia for the weekend for our son's baseball game. The tiny house was about 15 minutes or so from SAU's campus and was easily accessible right off the main road. The inside of the house is warm and inviting, but since it was our first experience in a tiny house, ever, there was some initial shock when we pulled into the driveway (you know, it's a tiny house). That wore off pretty instantly as--just like the pictures suggest--the house was inviting and comfortable: the interior design was well done. We slept exceptionally well. Since it was a quick turn around for us, we didn't have to cook while we were there. Our options were to stay in a hotel or Dana's place, and we made the right decision."

This tiny home was clean, the listed amenities were accurate, and Dana was friendly and quick to respond each time I reached out. When I needed to extend my stay by one night, she was very helpful in making it happen. A convenience store is within easy walking distance, as is 'The Smokin Bull' restaurant (Wed-Sat lunch and dinner at this time) and another place (missed the name) that sells ice, breakfast, and lunch. I work in this part of the state regularly and will keep Dana's tiny house locations on my list of options for overnight stays."

The location was a lot closer to the highway than I thought, but overall not a huge bother.
I was incredibly surprised by the food in Emerson and Magnolia. You have to go to the Smokin’ Bull and get their grits! Delicious!
Magnolia was the cutest little town only 15 minutes away and did a tiny hike at the Logoly Park nearby. Overall I would 10/10 recommend! Thanks Dana for being a wonderful host and creating such a cute place!"

Stayed a few nights","This property is a gem. The inside was immaculate, free of clutter and very comfortable. The outside is a wonderland from the dock to the huge back porch to the lounge area and fire pit areas. Beautifully landscaped and a lot of parking space. We enjoyed the beautiful sunsets from the dock and back porch.
The host was very helpful and reached out to us during our visit to see if we needed anything.
We highly recommend renting this property and would consider renting it again."

The only thing to be aware of is that there is only one bathroom so if you are traveling with a group of several adults, that might get a bit tricky, but not a deal breaker by any means! The host was also very gracious about early checkin/late checkout with great communication."

With Covid-19 I wanted to stay somewhere that was clean, plenty of space for our dog, 2, 11 & 17 year old. Patricias place allowed all of us to sit as a family or separate for alone time (11 & 17 year old lol 😂). Our oldest had her own room away from the boys. The bed my husband and I slept in was so comfortable, I wanted to take it home! The “FULLY” stocked kitchen was absolutely fantastic. I could go on and on about how great this little cottage was. We would definitely stay again!"

The house was super clean,and she provided things such as a fire stick, muffins, bottles of water, and other items that I never expect a host to provide. Her directions were perfect and she touched base a couple of times make sure everything was good. I was traveling alone and had the entire house to myself, but this place could easily accommodate an entire family. I will probably travel here in the future and this will be my first choice assuming it's not already booked. This place is extremely popular, so much so that I had to seek other arrangements(less accommodating)as it was already booked the final two nights of my trip."

Stayed about a week","After being displace from Lake Charles by Hurricane Laura, we were looking for a place that was closer to my MIL, we were a family of 8 (5 Adults, 3 Kids). My MIL found this “ Little Patch of Heaven” called Home Away from Home. At first I didn’t think it was going to house all of us comfortably, upon arriving we noticed that there was a grocery store that was within walking distance from the home ( a + because I love to cook). Then we arrived at the house. Getting out of the cars after a long drive felt as if we were visiting grandma’s house. The swing and rockers and on the porch really made the house inviting ( if you’re a morning coffee drinker you’ll love it here..... I DID🤣). We had access to the Whole house, walking into the house I wanted to cry because it really felt as if I walking into my grandma’s house, it was very clean and cozy. It felt like I grew up there and Ms. Patricia’s hospitality was immeasurable, very kind hearted, an all around Amazing personality. She made our 2 Wk stay worth coming back. By the time we left here home away from home. We felt like we were a part of her family. I know she’s definitely become a part of ours."

It’s an adorable older house that was sparkling clean smelled fresh and plenty of amenities to accommodate. Patricia was very prompt at responding, even into the late hours to help us with any questions we had. There’s a grocery store just a block down the rode and a Walmart. A lot of places were closed by 8:30pm though. I don’t know if that had to do with the times were going through currently or if it’s just the towns way, so I’d keep that in mind if you plan on checking in late. Other than that our stay was very satisfying and we’ll gladly stay there again."
