Stayed a few nights","We had a relaxing 3 days at Casey's place. The apartment was clean and beautifully decorated. Casey thought of some great touches to make people feel right at home.
The kitchen, bathroom, 2 bedrooms, and living room/dining rooms were all clean. The washer/dryer is a plus.
We will definitely return again in the fall.
Overall.....A+ and 5-stars!!"

Stayed a few nights","This is our 2nd time staying at Casey's place. We visited our son at SUNY Plattsburgh so it was great to be 6 minutes from his dorm.
The apartment was spotless. The kitchen was very clean. Bedrooms, including the bedding, were beautifully decorated. Bathroom was clean and Casey left some supplies. The LR was comfortable---my son loves lounging on the big sofa.
Casey answered our questions promptly. We have already booked our next stay next month in May.
Definitely A+, 10+, 5-star!!"

Stayed a few nights","Casey answered all my questions before arriving at his airbnb. Easy to use the locks to enter and what a pleasant surprise. It was much bigger than the ""cozy pictures."" Great comfy sofa and large kitchen with DR table. Washer/dryer included. 2 bedrooms with double bed in each. Beautifully decorated. One full bathroom was clean!! One air conditioner in the main bedroom but we did not use since the weather was beautifully cool.
We plan to return throughout the 4 years while our son is at SUNY Plattsburgh."

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I were visiting from out of town, and we originally rented a cabin from a close RV park. However, the cabin turned out not to be what we thought it was going to be. So we were in a pinch to find a place very quickly. We hopped on Airbnb and found this one was available. The host responded in less than an hour, and was more than happy to accommodate us. The area was very quiet. Place was very clean and the host was very nice. Overall a great experience."

The space was way nicer than the pictures show, there's a reason the rating is so high! Things are really clean, spacious, and comfy. The house is really well stocked without being cluttered, we easily had everything we needed. I particularly liked the view from the kitchen window which overlooks the practice fields. I can't say enough nice things, I would happily stay here again if I was ever in the area."

He has a great sense of humor and we enjoyed talking with him. He was also kind enough to help me jack my boat up so I could maneuver it better in his yard.
I would definitely recommend this listing...with one caveat:
The toilet is turned in an odd position which some might find awkward to use. He and I talked about it and I gave him some tips on how to turn it that should make it an easy fix for him. But aside from that one detail I would absolutely recommend Roger's listing!"

So convenient to the Field House (in your backyard!), shopping, restaurants, and a quiet hiking trail near the baseball fields. This large two-bedroom unit had everything I needed for a very pleasant stay. A great workstation for my remote computer set up, well-stocked kitchen with plenty of utensils and cookware, and two large bedrooms round out the apartment. Add a large living room with Roku setup and an amazing flowering tree and you have a lovely setup. Add to that a great host who was so helpful to clean off my car after the snowfall."

The place itself is spotless, well-designed, cozy & peaceful- exactly what I was looking for during my stay. I’d been preparing for weeks for an interview at a local company- I was extremely nervous about this but as soon as I entered the apartment I knew I was in the right spot. Clean, comfortable, quiet. The space put me at ease.
Spent hours reviewing materials for my interview/presentation without interruption and finished the night off reading a few chapters of one of the books they had in the living room area. Fell right asleep in the very comfortable bed.
Pretty sure I aced my interview! I’m excited to stay here again during my next trip to Plattsburgh- & spend less time studying and more time enjoying the wonderful space.
Thank you so much!"

Whenever I'm staying over in Plattsburgh, this is the first place I check for availability and will continue to be. Michael is a very responsive host who communicates quickly and clearly.

Stayed one night","We opted to try an AirBnB over the chain hotels while visiting our son at SUNY Plattsburgh. Michael's apartment was just perfect. Cheaper and more convenient than the hotel we were considering. The apartment was just as described, clean and quaint. Pictures are accurate. It's close to downtown and walkable in good weather. Much nicer vibe than the highway where most hotels are located. And it's just up the street from a great breakfast spot--Campus Corner. We will definitely stay here again."

Plentiful off-street parking. The pictures are accurate except for the desk, it has been replaced with one larger and more work friendly. Kitchen seemed well equipped, but we went out for all our meals. The unit was spotless and well supplied. We met the owner, and he was friendly and helpful. Should we head back to Plattsburgh it will be the first on our list of places to stay."

I honestly can’t say enough about Jill and Todd. They had bought a brand new Keurig for the place and it shorted and died on the first attempt to use it.
One message to Jill and Todd was at our doorstop with a new machine.
Jill created an experience to enjoy the event. She understood how her guests would best enjoy it and we couldn’t believe how easy everything was.
Thank you Jill and Todd!"

Group trip","We were a family of five: two parents and three adult children. This was one of the most well-appointed and comfortable places we have stayed. We particularly enjoyed the dining room and screened porch. Plattsburgh is definitely not a tourist destination, but we used it as a base to visit areas close by. One day was spent at a Vermont state park on Lake Champlain. Another in Montreal, just an hour drive north. (Parked our car at Angrignon metro stop and used the metro to get around.) Another day could have been spent hiking in areas to the west, and another day could have been spent at Ausable Chasm. So there is plenty to do in the area. Hosts were very responsive."

Stayed one night","This was a very nice home. We were only there one night, but it would be a great place to stay longer. Plenty of space and lovely furniture. If you’re older and have trouble with stairs, there is a bedroom and bathroom on the main floor. The other two bedrooms and bath are upstairs, and there was a hall light we were able to leave on at night to illuminate the entry to the stairs to prevent any accidental plunges down them in the night. We had to stay extra long because of some car problems and Jill was very gracious about all of it, and we were able to stay longer until the car problem was resolved. My only regret is that it wasn’t warm enough to use the lovely screened porch. It would be a great place to lounge in warmer weather."

The home itself is extremely charming. It was clean, tidy, and had many cute touches. The basement is HUGE and a great place to hang out, play games, or watch a movie on the big projector! The kitchen has everything you need to cook meals while everyone gathers around the kitchen island. My favorite gathering place was the screened porch! Plenty of seating and is made extra cozy with blankets and string lights in the evening.
As a host, Jill is extremely kind, welcoming, and quick to respond. She was sweet enough to leave us some champagne to celebrate my sister’s college graduation, and reached out a couple times to make sure we knew where things were.
I would 100% stay here again, and you should too!"

The surroundings are very green and peaceful. We even spotted a deer in the backyard once. We also walked around the neighborhood to a small beach where we could read books by the lake.

She explained everything about the house, internet, supplies etc. She left a textable # if we had any questions. The property is in a neighborhood convenient to the lake and the mountains. It was clean and there were plenty of towels, TP, paper towels etc. 2 thumbs up"

Stayed with a pet","Dana had awesome communication! The binder you find inside front door about the house with all details you might need is amazingly complete and helpful! The house location was perfect for the wedding at Valcour Inn and close to about anything you could need in Plattsburgh. The yard was perfect for our pup! The kitchen is fully outfitted with everything you might need to cook. The bathroom towels were superb and high quality and the shower was excellent! Follow the password for the Wifi included in the welcome binder and the Wifi worked great. There is wonderful closet space for hanging clothes for your formal events. The mattress in the master bedroom was a king, rather firm with a warmer on it and was quite comfortable. The only real negative is you need to be ready for those trains because they truly are close and they are loud. I am certain if you lived there you would eventually be used to them. Dana discloses this in her listing and she certainly can't change it but if you are a light sleeper of maybe if you have a baby be ready as they are a bit startling and they do blow horns in the middle of the night! We would 100% stay here again and am so very thankful for Dana's kindness. She even left us a complimentary bottle of bubbly in honor of our daughter's wedding! Just an awesome weekend!"

Had a lived in vibe, which makes cooking in a strange place easier, and I lived there for four nights. It was great, had my daughter join us, along with a friend a day later. I could accommodate everyone with food and a place to sleep. I read that there was train noise, and there was, but it was not a deal breaker. The wife didn't even mention it. Dana was great and very communicative. The garbage disposal was stuck and i was worried that I looked like a slacker, but after texting with Dana she said she would take care of it. She even went so far as to apologise,... silly. When I return to Plattsburgh, I will absolutely try to book this place again."

Group trip","Cons-
I was in town with for a college graduation with my family and 2 service animals. The property is loaded with security cameras and the owner (which lives next door) bombarded us requesting the registration paperwork for the service animals despite the Airbnb policy stating it’s not necessary. We provided the registration paperwork and we tried to put it behind us but never in my life have I dealt with hostility or name calling due to traveling with our service animals. Next time in town I will pay more money if needed and stay at a hotel, I suggest anyone traveling with a service animal do the same.
Maybe others have taken advantage of this host but that was not the case with us as my family members require these dogs to travel safely due to medical conditions (which is why we always carry the paperwork). It doesn’t feel good to have to explain this to a guy giving you attitude when traveling with your family.
Pros
Location was ideal for our purposes"

Stayed with kids","Our family of four came to the Orchard House for the 2024 eclipse and completely enjoyed our stay. The house is in a peaceful part of town, exactly what we were looking for.
We had let John know that we were going to be arriving much later than intended, and he let us know that it would not be an issue, and they would leave some lights on inside. Although it took a minute to figure out to go through the porch to get to the main lock, it was super easy for us to get in and just cozy on up to bed.
And cozy it was!! The house has TVs in every room, TONS of space, and something that is so hard to find -- a well stocked kitchen (amenity wise)!! We felt so at home. The yard out back was so fun to play in, and lots of outdoor toys were available for my kids, footballs, baseballs, etc.
Additionally, they made us a card commemorating our family trip to the eclipse. SO SWEET!!
If we ever come back up to the area (we travel a lot!) we will definitely try to stay at this place again."

Group trip","We had a wonderful girls weekend at 36 Waterhouse. The house was impeccably clean and well organized. The bedrooms were very spacious and the linens were very clean. The kitchen was well stocked and everything was in great working order. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch for coffee in the morning. Heather and Jason were very responsive and very friendly. The house is in a great location near the Saranac river, SUNY Plattsburgh (we could even see our old dorms across the river!), and the house was very close to the downtown restaurants. Highly recommend if you are visiting the college or spending time up in the Adirondacks!"

Stayed a few nights","We received a warm welcome from our hosts Jason and Heather at the start of our Christmas stay (23rd - 29th December) - they had even installed a Christmas tree for our visit!
The house was spotless and everything worked. Jason and Heather have carried out a remarkable renovation of the property which now includes two spacious bathrooms and kitchen the right size for a family to comfortably prepare a full scale Christmas dinner.
A feature of the location is that within a 5 minute walk there is footbridge over the Saranac River in a rather scenic spot; this takes one to the extensive green campus of the University of New York at Plattsburgh and onto the bike and walking path along the left bank of the river.
We definitely recommend this rental for a comfortable, peaceful stay in Plattsburgh on edge of the Adirondack park region."

Colleen is the sweetest, most wonderful person. Her extra touches made the stay even better - a welcome message, a birthday cupcake for my son, real maple syrup, microwave & coffee maker, a basket of sundries in the bathroom in case we forgot something. The shower was super nice and the whole house is extremely clean. There is such a great vibe to Colleen and her house, we recommend it 100 percent."

It was all the more excellent advice when we wanted to go for a romantic restaurant or guide us for hikes to do in the Adirondaks! It was really a beautiful WE with him.

Perfect stop to recharge over night for our long drive up to Quebec City. I recommend, and would stay again."

Her home is clean and comfortable and Colleen is friendly and happy to chat and make suggestions about places to visit or eat. She generously offered pool use, though we didn't swim as the weather was coolish. Her home is located on the shores of Lake Champlain and boasts gorgeous views. It's close to parks, the city beach, and a short drive to downtown Plattsburgh. Book it, you won't regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","After a long drive, it was so wonderful to have the host Colleen waiting there to greet us. So many times the code to get in doesn't work or we can't find the room. We kept her posted of our ETA and she answered and responded immediately to all of our questions and comments. Her beautiful home is directly across from Lake Champlain. We sat outside on the covered porch enjoying the breeze from the lake and watching the amazing sunsets. We looked forward to our evening chats with Colleen and as the saying goes ""enter as strangers and leave as friends"" and this is certainly how we felt when we left. Her home was impeccably clean and organized and as an adirondack decor lover myself, I felt right at home. We had use to a coffee pot, microwave and refrigerator which was extremely handy for my vegan diet. Our reason to staying in Champlain was to get our Global Entry pass for international travel. It was an easy 24 minute drive to the enrollment center. The bedroom was on the second floor and to my delight had a wall of windows to allow lots of natural sunlight to come in. It was a hot evening so unfortunately we couldn't sleep with all the windows open so we turned on the air instead but this feature would be amazing on a cool fall evening. Thank you so much Colleen for all the special treats. We hope our paths cross again in the future. We wish you the best. Brigitte & Lou"

The bedroom is very quiet, the bed is super comfortable. We slept like hibernating bears.
Colleen is the consummate host, she gave us good advice regarding where we could get a quick sandwich (Gus’s).

The room is extremely clean, purified air, super comfy bed, the coziness is almost legendary 😃
Thanks so much Colleen for everything even though this was short stay!

We were in a tight situation and Colleen was completely at the ready to book us, do a thorough clean after the last guest checked out, and get us settled in last minute. As a host she goes above and beyond to make sure every bit of space is SPOTLESS and cozy. All conveniences are thought of, and if you have any issues at all she will be extremely receptive. Colleen is a great presence to be around and is also is extremely mindful of sharing the space. We LOVED her pets who were very friendly. If you have allergies of course they may not be your cup of tea, but they were a huge bonus for us :) The area is absolutely serene and dreamy. We are absolutely looking forward to our next visit!!"

However the listed check in time needs to be changed because when it says 4 to 6 PM it makes guests think they have to check in by 6.

Few tips to others: (a) side and rear yards are small, so plan to be inside or going somewhere; (b) nice fenced playground is 2 blocks away and is great for young children to run around and play; (c) there’s a lookout with benches to view the river down the street from firehouse (facing the firehouse, go left); (d) carpeted steps are steep with shallow treads, so keep in mind if you have anyone that has mobility issues; landing area is at the sloped roof, so watch your head coming up the steps (I’m 5’2” and occasionally bumped the ceiling); (e) home had karaoke, games, and bikes for use; (f) supercenter Walmart and other stores were less than 10 mins away to get supplies, etc."

Has a nice assortment of games but didn't want to scare anyone off with our singing talents with the karaoke machine. Christina sent us the check-in instructions earlier in the day so we weren't scrambling for codes etc. especially since we were in airport mode on our phones. We would stay again."

Stayed with kids","House was just as pictured inside! Everything was very clean and tidy and recently renovated. Christina was very nice to communicate with and responded quickly to everything. Was a very comfortable house for our family to stay in and was relatively close to a lot of fun activities. We were mostly out and about but we really enjoyed having the old school video games to play where I could finally be the ones beating my kids! The stairs took a little getting used to by everyone but didn’t at all affect our enjoyment of the house. Others made comments about the fire station alarm. This was not a concern for us (even if the alarm had gone off) as we did not hear the alarm go off during our stay. I really enjoyed the extras she had available at the house to use even if we didn’t get to all of it.
All in all.. great stay and we were sad to be leaving."

Stayed with kids","We had a comfortable stay and Christina was a kind and responsive host. Everything inside the home is in new condition and was very clean. The beds and furnishings were very nice. A couple of things to be aware of....the stairs are quite steep with narrow steps, so that might be a challenge for anyone with balance or mobility issues. I personally would also feel nervous carrying an infant or toddler up and down the stairs. All three bedrooms are upstairs, and the bathroom is downstairs. And as mentioned, there is a fire horn from the firehouse that goes off occasionally (we heard it three times in a three day stay). I think that is reflected in the very reasonable nightly rate. Overall, it was definitely more pleasant for a family of 4 than staying together in one hotel room together, and for about the same price. We would stay there again."

It kinda did give you the feeling of being in a farm house!!.Even though this home was not in the immediate plattsburgh area it was only a 5 to 10 min drive to get to anyplace in plattsburgh. I was there to visit the college and to see the area for possible relocation and i was impressed. I originally wanted to relocate to the city of plattsburgh but after my stay in this home in morrisonville im goimg to look in this area. OH and i read the reviews before i chose this home and one review mentioned the fire house and the alarm, let me tell you i never heard that alarm go off ounce and i was in that house majority of my time.

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay in this cozy neighborhood near family and friends in my hometown - convenient to hop into town or have some delivery options available. Christina thought of everything, even nonslip socks, mints on the pillow, and pantry staples (cooking oil, spices), recommendations binder, and TOYS stocked (including karaoke!) which is above and beyond other stays I've had in similar accommodations. No-contact check-in and check-out was seamless, with timely snow removal. This is a new rental, so I left some minor notes which I'm sure Christina will swiftly address for an even better stay for the next guests. We will definitely be back and have told our local connections to book for their visitors too! An accessibility note: this is a very well done remodel of an older home - the slope of the stairs and ceiling to the second floor reflect that. All bedrooms are upstairs, so if you have mobility issues this will be a challenge. Kiddos handled it great~"

The property is simply breathtaking and relaxing. We planned for a peaceful relaxing time and we got just that, moments on the terraces by the lake, time in the jacuzzi, walking in nature, eating breakfast with cool lake breezes on the deck. Nights are so peaceful. Jon & Sergio go out of their way to make you feel at home and comfortable. The amenities are bountiful, jacuzzi, gas grill, paddle boats, kayaks, lawn chairs, etc.. everything you need to relax and enjoy. There are 3 lovely units to choose from and we were gifted with a tour of the units and also of Jon & Sergio’s home as they live in the house as well, each unit being separate you never are disturbed by any noise. It was an added bonus that we could bring out two small dogs who also enjoyed the stay. I absolutely can not recommend a visit enough, we will be back for the winter."

And most importantly, the hosts. As soon you arrive they give you a tour of the entire place, taking away any doubts that may exist.
It’s incredible, Jon, Lorenzo and Zara made as feel welcome, later we had the opportunity to meet Sergio , They are AMAZING 🤩. Super friendly and most importantly they give my puppy 🐶 a lot of love 💗.
Any questions they will be there to help you.
It’s a unique experience. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get out of the routine and go relax!

The simple, elegant decor created such a peaceful vibe, keeping the lake as the real focus. The house is stocked with all the typical things that you might need. The property is lovely and feels secluded even though there are other houses somewhat nearby (almost entirely obscured by trees). The lake is just steps from the house with a pebble/rock beach leading into the crystal clear water. The fire pit area is so cute and comfortable and is overlooking the amazing lake view. There are so many nice little details inside and out to experience at this property. This is a beautiful place to unplug and enjoy peace & quiet."

The lake water was crystal-clear, and the smooth pebble shore made for perfect swimming conditions. The linens were high-quality, and there were plenty of towels and extra linens for the sofa bed. Bathrooms were spotless, and the primary bathroom shower was amazing. The kitchen was well-stocked with coffee and individual creamer and all kinds of teas. I had one question before we checked in, and the owners responded immediately and were so helpful What a special place this is. We would absolutely love to return one day."

We did a daytrip to Burlington, taking the ferry over. Easy drive to Plattsburg for restaurants. Happy Pike right down the road for ice cream. The Naked Turtle is a must dinner/lunch stop. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend or book the boat house again!"

Stayed about a week","The house is perfectly laid out. Bedrooms are at either side of the house with their own bathroom. The towel’s are top quality. The sheets and blankets are also top quality. The beds are firm and comfortable.
The kitchen is stocked with the right amount of pots and pans and there’s a set of SHARP knives. The owners provide dish towels and sponges and good quality cleaning supplies. The living room and dining room furniture is efficient and comfortable.
Outside, the firepit is a perfect evening spot to sit and relax. And the lake/beach is 20 steps from the back door.
The Beachouse is an exceptional place to relax and swim. The water is warm and clean. The house is a 1/2 mile drive from Lake Shore Drive, so it’s quiet all the time. We stayed a week, but easily it could have been 2 weeks."

Stayed with kids","The boathouse is like heaven on the lake! We’ve been staying on Lake Champlain for the last 6 years and this is by far our favorite place. The house is absolutely beautiful and is even nicer than the photos. Located down a private driveway, it is nestled in the trees right near the lake. The proximity of the house to the lake makes it extra special. You can see and hear the lake from inside the house. The beach area has small rocks and is safe for kids. The house was clean and comfortable, with everything you need to relax and play on the lake. We felt right at home, like a true Airbnb experience. The only thing we missed was air conditioning… we had a couple of really hot and humid days in the 90’s in early July. Thank you for sharing your special home with us… we can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed with kids","Really lovely home for our family of 4 to enjoy a lake vacation. The reviews are spot-on: super-clean, comfy beds, stocked kitchen, amazing view. We appreciated that this is a quiet part of the lake without a lot of boating or crowds. We enjoyed swimming, paddle boarding, and fishing. The beach is very rocky so bring water shoes if you want to enjoy it.
Wished there were more restaurants nearby. We drove into Plattsburgh quite a bit. Great craft breweries there! Good summit hikes are 40 mins to an hour drive. Home was a great size for two adults and two grade school kids. The futon upstairs is small so don’t plan on someone taller than about 4.5’ using it. My son thought it was comfy.
Area is very agricultural and you can smell the cows from the lake. Not too bad, but not what I expected! Water was clear and temp was comfortable for swimming in mid-July. I loved that the loft space was stocked with yoga mats. Beautiful view for yoga!"

I enjoyed doing yoga in the loft, walking the property listening to absolute silence and light natural wintery sounds of the woods. There’s plenty to do between relaxing, hiking or exploring the nearby towns (e.g., Plattsburgh, Burlington, etc). The house is well constructed with two beautiful bedrooms with sliding glass doors facing the lake, each with a private bathroom. The heated floors during the winter are to die for. The place was immaculate and the hosts were communicative. I’d love to come back one day!"

No review or picture can do the lake justice, especially at sunrise and sunset. We truly enjoyed our stay and ability to slow down on the water at this fabulous location. We highly recommend the boathouse and hope to be back some day!
Ps..check out Quiche et Crepe in nearby Plattsburgh for a delicious, homeade French-inspired meal and a cozy chat with the wonderful owner Evelyne! Highly recommend!!"

At night we enjoyed campfires by the firepit. The loft was perfect for yoga with the beautiful view of the lake from the large window.

Stayed with kids","The first thing my wife noticed was how clean this place was. It was so clean we didn't clean ourselves when we got there! The second thing we noticed was the view of the lake. Right out the sliding doors is a patio area with a fire pit overlooking the lake. We launched our canoe from the smooth-rocked shore for fishing excursions in the bay and, once, a trip to the Happy Pike just down the lake. The house was a perfect base to come back to after day trips to the Ausable Chasm, Lyon Mountain, and Vermont. We would have loved a day trip to Montreal (which you can see from Lyon Mt) but settled for driving along the border so the kids could see Canada. Everything we needed to cook was provided, just add food. There was a great selection of tea as well. This was a great place to stay for our family vacation. I would highly recommend staying here if you are going to Lake Champlain."

Stayed with kids","Breathtaking view right on the lake! The windows along the back of the house bring the outside in and make the place really gorgeous. The photos are totally accurate with how close the house is to the shore - literally 20 feet. The place itself is so cozy and lovely. I have two kids and figured one would stay on the futon in the upstairs loft area and the other one in the guest room on the main floor, but the futon was definitely small for sleeping on, so they shared the bed in the guest room. If you have going to have more than four people (meaning two people in each of two beds) I might recommend bringing air mattresses. Entry was super easy, communication was fantastic. I emailed with the hosts in advance about ideas for local activities, and they were great with getting right back to me. The immediate surrounding area is lovely for walks and we drove to Ausable Chasm, North Hero area, and we tried out a few restaurants in Chazy and Rouse's Point. Favorite thing was just to hang out at the house, though, and enjoy a change of scenery in a beautiful environment with the family. The kitchen was so well stocked, showers were great, and the beds were comfy! The place is amazingly well insulated and warm, especially considering that we had cold weather and intense wind."

Stayed a few nights","Kristen and her husband are the most Amazing aibnb hosts you can wish for!! If possible I would give them 10 stars and BEYOND!
Not only is the Apartment a beautiful gem in a wonderful location, they where extremely helpful while our car broke down to help in every possible way!! They are still helping with car issues even I have left!!
The Appartement is perfectly located in a very beautiful quiet neighborhood with very nice, spacious, modern kitchen and bathroom, comfortable stylish furniture, beds and sparkling clean.
In minutes you can walk to downtown or to the waterfront trail with beautiful mountain views towards Vermont. It’s a 5 minute drive to get to the University.
We are so very grateful to have met the hosts as they are exceptional people, very generous and kind :-) :-) :-)
THANK YOU!!!"

Stayed a few nights","My family of 3 had the best time at Kristen's apartment. They all said ""This is the best airbnb we've ever stayed at!""
The apartment was extremely clean, and had all the comforts of home and then some. It was a luxurious and very comfortable stay, so much so that we actually became home bodies for the week! We had movie nights and dinners in and it was all around perfect and peaceful.
The location was wonderful. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood about a 5-10 min walk to a trail and beautiful views of the lake. Downtown, groceries, and retail stores are just a short drive away.
The apartment is connected to Kristen's home, so if you ever need anything, she's there to help. When I told her I was working from home, she even brought in a whole desk for me to work at. That was very thoughtful of her. At the same, she and her husband also give plenty of privacy to their guests.
Kristen definitely deserves the superhost title. She has thoughtful notes all throughout the apartment and has everything organized and easily accessible for her guests. It's well supplied with plenty of storage, too."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect location just outside of downtown Plattsburgh, a short walk to many of the places we had to be this weekend. The place was beautiful, clean and perfect for what we were looking for. Kristen had helpful notes all around to help make sure we had everything we needed! We highly recommend this AirBnB!"

Stayed a few nights","I have been a super host for 10 years with 4 listings so I have a little experience with hosting and I will say that Kristens home was top notch! I take a lot of pride in my properties but I walked away realizing I needed to step up my game, lol.
The property was immaculate and well appointed. I’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s and inevitably they were lacking in some way, but Kristen anticipated every conceivable need a guest might have.
Needless to say, I would highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed one night",My family and I needed a place to stay overnight before heading to SUNY Plattsburgh for a college tour with our daughter. This was the perfect spot for sure! Loved the amazing accommodations and all the special touches Kristen has added to this wonderful Airbnb.. We enjoyed walking to town for dinner and coming back to relax in this beautifully appointed residence. Don’t hesitate to reserve…you will be thrilled that you did!

Stayed one night",Our experience with Kristen and her apartment could not have been better. We were in Plattsburgh to visit with old college pals. The location was perfect for an easy walk into downtown. Kristen has thought of everything and the apartment was well appointed and impeccably clean. Her communication was timely and helpful. We will stay there again next time we are in Plattsburgh and you will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here too!!

Stayed a few nights","The town of Plattsburgh itself is small, with not much to do. But the people we encountered were kind and helpful.
Our stay in town was made only better thanks to Kristen’s beautiful home. She has everything you could think of to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We were blown away from the moment we walked through the door and felt right at home during our entire stay.
I can’t recommend this place enough.
Kristen was the best host we’ve ever had the pleasure of conducting business with!"

It was clean, warm and cozy, contemporary and attractively furnished and everything we needed was at hand. Kristen even decorated the apartment for Christmas including a beautifully lit tree. It is not easy to be away from home at Christmas, but this felt like home to us. We look forward to a return stay."

The very modern kitchen with all the amenities; two comfy bedrooms with tons of closet space, a beautiful living room and a cute dinning table. All decorated nicely with ascent pillows, tons of plants, ample sun light and very comfortable atmosphere. We visited the place with my mom and had a grand time. Kristen was very responsive and always available. We had a great conversation and the little binder for guests was detailed and very helpful. We can’t wait to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This apartment absolutely lived up to it's description of peaceful. It's located in a quiet neighborhood and the interior is warm and inviting. It's very spacious and accommodated the needs of my handicapped dad perfectly. It is equipped with everything you need for daily living. We walked right in and felt at home.
Knowing that my father had mobility constraints, Bill and Kristen met us in the driveway to greet us and help with our luggage. They shared with us about activities in their area and were quick to respond with communication and offer help with any needs we had.
We would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area and would not hesitate to rent again when we visit in the future."

The beds were so comfortable! This is a 3-4 minute walk to a beautiful walking/biking path (approx. 1.5 miles in length). We went kayaking and hiking in the Ausable region which was only a short drive away. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.

It is conveniently located near downtown Plattsburgh, yet there are walking trails nearby (walking distance) which offer stunning views of Lake Champlain particularly at sunset. Kristen was a great host communicating with us often (but not overbearing). No doubt she will be a super host soon. We would stay there again."

Stayed one night","Kristen’s apartment was awesome, very spacious, and you could really tell a lot of thought was put into the design of the space. My family of 4 loved this accommodation and felt right at home. Our grandma had a very easy time navigating in and out of the bathroom/shower as there was no step and plenty of railings. A very thoughtful touch! Unfortunately, we only stayed for one night. We would have loved to stay longer to enjoy Kristen’s perfect apartment. Would definitely stay here again!"

I needed to bedrooms because I had my parents over. Kristen is very a sweet host, always tries to offer any help or just asks to make sure everything is in order. Hope to stay there again whenever I may be back in that area and if Kristen is still renting out her place."

Despite her home being attached to the apartment, there is still the concept of solidarity and peace as she gives suggestions when needed and is always open to help. Her communication skills are 10/10 and so is the home. It was a lovely stay and I’d definitely do it again !"
