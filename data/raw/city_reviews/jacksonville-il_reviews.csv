Group trip","Brad exceeded expectations with Cors Arena. My 12 best friends and I hosted my Bachelor Olympics in the facility and had an absolute blast. We were there for 3 nights total.
The bunk beds are deceivingly comfortable, basketball court was regulation (and somehow feels bigger in person than in pictures), and the living room/kitchen area is the perfect hangout space.
With 13 mouths to feed we were able to make a quick Walmart trip and make use of the pots, pans, utensils, and even some condiments that Brad kindly had pre-stocked.
“This place is fricken awesome”

The ability to play our music was very cool, although I wish there was a way to control the volume in the gym area because it was significantly louder than in the kitchen area. Overall everything was perfect and we hope that we can come back and play more pick up ball."

One of the nights the AC was not working and it was very hot in there. Brad was responsive snd sent someone next morning. It somehow started working when she tried.
Other than that no issues. It was clean and well kept. Fun place"

Group trip","It was a phenomenal place. The picture do not do it justice. Full court basketball court with plenty of room to play 5v5. The place has plenty of balls for multiple sports. It has bluetooth speakers that connect with any bluetooth device that plays through the whole downstairs area. The TV are very nice and quite big. The kitchen and living room area were big and great for community. The bunk room was fun with everyone sleeping in it and the beds were comfortable.
The only downsides were that the place in literally next to train tracks and the trains can be loud during the day and through the night. The court is a sports court surface so it can be a little rough on the legs but it is still full size.
It was an amazing place and would highly recommend."

Group trip","We had a great time at the lake house. The paths are beautiful, the lake is peaceful, and it all felt extremely secluded. The house looks better in person than in the photos, in my opinion, and the location is near enough to both Springfield and St. Louis to be able to make the drive during your stay.
The only thing that would’ve improved our stay is if there were privacy locks on the interior doors; bathroom, bedrooms, etc.
Otherwise 5/5 experience all the way, there’s definitely a reason Bill has stellar reviews on this listing. We’re looking forward to the next chance we have to stay again!"

Stayed about a week","Very, peaceful, lots of nature, loved the pond. Saw many deer, birds, squirrels, fish, turtles, etc... We didnt want to leave the back porch over the pond! Host is easy to get along with, very responsive. Good hot water, comfortable bed, very adequate kitchen and bathrooms. Its a little way out from everything but that is what we were expecting and we found it to our liking. I would recommend arriving during the daylight hours as the back roads and secluded property might be intimidating to navigate at night if you are not familiar with the area. We had no problems traveling at night after we arrived, just would suggest trying to time your initial arrival during daylight hours. We hope to rent it again on our next visit! Thank you Bill!"

She greeted us upon arrival after having ask ahead of time. She gave us a tour of the home and showed us everything we needed to know during our stay. There were board games and books for the kids. The home was very clean and tidy, we couldn't be happier with our stay. I was sick part of the time but having a bedroom and bathroom upstairs away from the business of the house help tremendously. I was very pleased. Mary was a super nice host, she even checked in to make sure everything was going well during our stay. We will be back to visit."

Stayed one night","Audrey's Abode was very clean and cozy. We enjoyed the historic feel with modern amenities. We did crank the AC and make use of the fans upstairs to cool the space. Sound certainly traveled from floor to floor, so if you had a group staying with you, I would recommend some earplugs or white noise machines. Other than that, the couch was probably the only other thing that might need some attention as it attempts to swallow you whole when you first sit down on it. These two minor things aside, we really enjoyed the space and if we have more time in the future, we'd love to book a longer stay."

Stayed with a pet",Audrey’s Abode is the perfect getaway. My daughter and I stayed for two nights and loved being able to get away from it all while knowing anything we needed was a short drive away. We enjoyed doing some thrifting in town and being able to come back and relax. The first floor is perfect for two with a nice size bedroom and beautiful bathroom. If you have a bigger crew the “attic” is finished as a large open area with 3 more beds to sleep 6. Loved it. Hope to go back when the weather is nicer and use the fire pit.

Stayed about a week","Stacey and Troy are very friendly and quickly respond to requests. They were in the area nearby and readily offer anything they think you might need, including coffee! The house is located in a secluded neighborhood. It was quiet and peaceful. The place was clean and there is plenty of room in the living area and kitchen. The enclosed porch and garage was also very nice. There are ramps for handicap access. The floor plan is a little awkward and bathroom is small and the headspace in the stairs up to the 2nd floor was tight but managable. All the appliances and amenities seemed new and worked well. The towels, washer, dryer, oven and dishwasher seemed new and worked as expected. I would recommend written instructions for the thermostat and additional lighting in some of the locations (in front of the laundry and exterior porch). I would definitely recommend the place to others and stay there again myself. Thanks for a great stay!"

So many things to do in surrounding cities for vacationers or a weekend outing without the hustle and bustle. ( Lincoln’s Tomb, home, library, Illinois Museum a few in Springfield ) We are planning another family gathering this summer, I’m sure fishing and cook outs will be enjoyed!!! Defiantly the best B &B in the surrounding area!!!!"

We just needed a weekends get away from our busy sports schedule and this was the right place for it. The kids enjoyed the private area to fish and pulled a big catfish up. There was plenty of land to walk around. We enjoyed cooking out and sitting by the fire. Our hosts were amazing and met all our needs. They were kind enough to bring over some water guns for our kids to play with. Stacey even helped us find a local pool when the kids decided they wanted more than water guns. It was a good weekend with great hosts. We would definitely visit again

Stayed with kids","cute and spacious. Stacey is a very hands on host who also seems to be looking for socializing if you're up for it. She brought Wine and was still updating as I was staying. I enjoy my privacy but if you like your neighbors and the stories they tell to the town, this is your cup of Tea. they are an ope book and they entire town knows ther name. she sometimes leaves personal things there so please be advised she will take the initiative to remove or add as she pleases as well. Again, beautiful space, but there were many dead insects on the windows cob webs around.. also wasps and birds are known to get in. The guy next door like to pop over uninvited too. just be aware they are all ""friendly"" but felt a bit intrusive especially when they spoke to my kids before speaking to me. it's not very kids friendly. Maybe that will change."

Super clean inside with beautiful stained glass windows in rich hues of yellow to capture the early morning light.
Period accurate furniture and a beautiful quilt on the bed compliment the other farmhouse touches throughout.
The homemade coffee cake left inside a beautiful glass cake stand made my morning coffee extra special!
Outside you'll find a peaceful country setting with a clawfoot tub and plenty of hot water to soak your cares away. They even provide candles and bubble bath!

Stayed one night","The Bunkhouse is a unique experience. At a very minimum, you can think of it as a stand-alone hotel room in a century old building. One of its biggest strengths comes from the fact that it is, in fact, a free-standing building with all the amenities and privacy of a home to yourself, even though it is in a tiny package. They do have another cabin next-door which might cause some issues if you find yourself booked in tandem with a group that doesn't respect the silence of the countryside, but we luckily found ourselves in the Bunkhouse during an unexpected cold snap that kept everyone inside. That cold came at a price, and the ancient building did have some draft issues around the front door where we had to pile our suitcases to block the stream of arctic air. In all fairness to the Bunkhouse, it does have a wall unit that can be used for heat or cool air and a small electric radiator was plugged in next to the bed to help keep us warm. We enjoyed the stay and would certainly stay again"

We arrived late and had to leave early in the morning, but enjoyed every moment. The cabin has so much charm from the beautiful exterior/interior to the stained glass windows. The bed was comfortable and we slept great. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals. The bathroom was good and there was plenty of hot water in the shower. Coffee was provided and much appreciated. They even left us two pieces of coffee cake, which were delicious! There is another cabin next door, but the entrance and deck to this one are on the opposite side, so it feels very private. Parking is right next to the cabin, which made it easy for loading/unloading. The grounds are amazing with rolling farmlands and views of the distance. I went on a very nice country run in the morning despite the cold temperatures. There is an outdoor tub, which would be great in warmer months. Loved it!"

While close to the other cabin, I really didn’t notice my neighbors after I pulled in. Very clean, well stocked kitchen, WiFi, TV and even an outdoor soaking tub. The deck was roomy and inviting. Could not have asked for anything else. Would recommend staying here."

Jacksonville has an interesting history and you can learn a lot about the area by visiting the museums and touring the local farmhouse that is open to the public. Jacksonville Lake is beautiful as is Nicholas Park. The Community Park was also very interesting and well kept. Would love to go back to this area and stay at the bunkhouse again!

Everything was even better than expected, especially the fresh coffee cake waiting for us—and the house was fully stocked with everything we could have needed for our trip. We didn’t have a chance to use the outdoor bathtub, but it was such a unique element that we can’t wait to try out next time we stay here (which hopefully will be soon). If you are staying here and looking for a short day trip, we went to the New Philadelphia Town National Historic Site (near Barry) and to the Mark Twain house in Hannibal, MO, and would highly recommend both. All in all, this was one of our favorite Airbnb experiences. Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I loved staying at this place. Check in / check out was a breeze. Although there is another rental property next door, it feels very private - mostly due to the stain glass windows which block views into the bunkhouse (and are also beautiful!) and the private porch / yard for this bunkhouse which cannot be seen or accessed by the other property. The bunkhouse is very cute inside and out and the indoor shower and outdoor bath both worked very well. The bed was firm but comfortable and we loved seeing the views outside from the through the window. We spent a lot of time on the porch bird watching and spent one evening by the fire pit. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again if in the area. Also, heavenly delight - the ice cream place Bryan recommends in the listing - is absolutely worth a visit. Best soft serve we’ve ever had."

Stayed a few nights","Picked this place as I was planning my wife’s birthday and saw the cozy cabin with a nice fire pit. My plan was to make steak for my wife over the fire pit and communicated that to Amber. I did ask about firewood, but I was also prepared and brought some of my own just incase. But upon arrival I realized Amber had went ahead to put aside firewood for us. Along with a bag of charcoal for the BBQ pit. Plus some ribeye rub as a gift. I think that was a fantastic touch and an astute observation.
The property itself is cozy and clean. The kitchen is very simple and beautiful. The decor is very classic and rustic. I wish I could own such a beautiful property.
The location was a little hard to get too. We used our car onboard GPS and it brought us to a wrong location. We had to correctly put in the GPS coord before we manage to find our way there. The closest “small” town is White Hall which was sufficient. Around the property is quiet. Closest “big” town would be Grafton about an hour away"

Although the driveway is a rather steep narrow gravel hill, with about 4 stairs to an upper outdoor porch, once you open the door & take your bags & groceries inside, you will quickly find an exquisitely decorated & comfortable studio. The Quarry Cottage makes good use of it's studio space. I especially enjoyed the electric heated fireplace & it's ambient lighting. The mattress is comfortable. The kitchen is large enough to prepare any meal, & if you enjoy grilling meat & vegetables, there is an outdoor grill, a free small bottle of dry seasoning, & outdoor seating. You can also enjoy a camp fire towards the bottom of the gravel driveway. This would be a wonderful AirBnB for couples or anyone wanting a very quiet getaway. The WIFI connection was also strong, for virtual workers & streaming Netflix or other channels. The woodland setting is very peaceful."

It was as advertised; quiet, clean, and personable. You can tell Amber cares for her guests’ experience by the way she communicates as a host and the thought that went into the cabin."

The hosts provided the amenities we needed and even went above and beyond to provide lighter fluid, charcoal, bug spray, etc. We drove about 40 mins to hike at Mccullys Heritage Project and then spent some time in Pittsfield enjoying some local coffee and ice cream. This was a very relaxing vacation that we would recommend to others!"

Stayed a few nights","located in what I like to call ""hill country"" of Illinois, this was by far one of the nicest Airbnb's that I have stayed in. The design and style feels luxurious and comfortable with the modern brass fixtures and simplicity of natural materials and textiles. We turned off our phones as soon as we arrived.
We relaxed and slept well on the queen size bed, watched movies, and enjoyed the outdoors while grilling. The large picture window in the kitchen really feels like it brings the outdoors inside.
We spent the day driving through nearby towns and visiting Pere Marquette State Park where the views of the Illinois river basin were spectacular from their many lookout points. The state park reminded us of Starved Rock State park but far less crowded.
I would definitely recommend to friends and family needing an escape for a weekend, where they can unplug and unwind."

Stayed with kids","What a great find this place was! It’s an adorable little house that is cozy and beautifully decorated. The fireplace was so nice after a long, cold Saturday spent outdoors.
My husband, daughter and I felt very at home at Amber’s place for the two nights we stayed. There was plenty of bedding, towels, toiletries, and kitchen supplies and there was also a brand new grill on the property that we didn’t get a chance to use. Also, since we were traveling for a softball tournament it was so nice to have a full size washer and dryer available to us as well. We didn’t even have to bring our own detergent!
Check in was simple and Amber was great at communicating with us. It was obvious the owners wanted to make sure we were well taken care of and I can’t recommend their place highly enough! We plan to stay again in the future."

It felt spacious for our family of four, and the style was historic and pretty. I also loved how it was stocked with everything we needed for a comfortable stay (including soap and dryer sheets for laundry!). The host was easy to communicate with, and we had no major issues. We stayed over the weekend, so some noise was expected as the rental is located over a business. If you like waking up early to the smell of coffee, this place is for you. Other town businesses that we enjoyed were just a short walk down the block (a Mexican restaurant and a local community market)."

Some may not be in love with the original hard wood floors but for me they only add to the character.
The residence is huge and full of charm.
The only real downside is it's located in a tiny town where everything for miles is closed by 10 pm. That's just a sacrifice that everyone makes living or staying in small towns.
We would 100% rent again From Jaclyn!
Oh and don't forget to go down stairs to the coffee/bike shop in the morning!!!!"

The space is also way bigger than the pictures make it seem (the beauty of old buildings--high ceilings, tons of windows). It was the perfect place for a quiet weekend getaway to rest and reset. I'm already planning my next visit!
I do recommend bringing a pair of house slippers--old floors feel grimy no matter how clean they are (trust me, I had an apartment from the 1920's with original wood floors and no amount of sweeping and mopping ever made them feel truly ""clean""--definitely not a fault against the space at all, it was very clean so I know its just an old floors thing). Embrace the historic vibes and just wear some slippers :)"

Suite A and Suite D are particularly beautiful — large and accommodating, with beautiful period furniture. Quality mattresses, and full kitchen makes for a comfortable stay. Management is extremely responsive and will quickly respond to any issue that comes up. I’ve stayed several times and have never been disappointed!"

Group trip","This is my second visit to Dewitt Extended Stay. My family rented Suite A (on the ground floor), and my brother’s family were directly above us in Suite D. Both suites are large and beautifully furnished. Mattresses are high-quality, and suites were provided with plenty of linens. High-speed Wi-Fi with some premium channels logged in already — made after-dinner family movie night fun for teens and adults alike. Full kitchen makes longer stays more comfortable and affordable. This property is in one of the loveliest areas of historic Jacksonville, and we loved morning walks in the area. Plenty of warm water to accommodate morning showers for 4 teens and 4 adults. Very fast response from host throughout the booking process, easily and quickly accommodated when we had to change our dates by one day. Lots of information on site to help guide us to Jacksonville historic, restaurant, and activity highlights. This has become my go-to spot for staying in Jacksonville."

The staff was very helpful in adding days for us as our home was being repaired and contractor needed more time. Scotty is a fantastic host! And Jim was helpful. Steve was helpful with changes and additions. Apts are large and clean and feel like home. I highly recommend to anyone coming to the area to stay there. They will do all they can to help you be comfotable. Privacy is a plus there also. It really IS a mansion. It looks a little rough on the outside but dont be fooled. Its beautiful with high ceilings, clean rooms, and cozy furniture and beds. Fantastic stoves in the kitchens, also. We had rented apt D first, upstairs and very quiet. Then they were very helpful and let us move downstairs to Apt A to accomodate our dog so he wouldnt have to climb all the stairs. Apt A was just as nice and quiet, and also has a baby grand piano! Nice touch. I would stay again and tell anyone i know needing a place to stay in Jacksonville to give it a try.!"

This set up is made of individual apartments. A group of us stayed there in 4 of the apartments. There is not really a common area inside to hang together. This was not a huge deal to us because it was so nice outside, day and night! We sat on the front porch. Lovely views of other similar historic homes/buildings. I felt safe in this area. Small park within walking distance, named Duncan Park. Scotty was very easy to get ahold of and very prompt with responses. So much character in this building."

This is walking distance to the town square as well as Illinois College. And, take advantage of a walk, especially in spring! The neighborhood, on State, the parallel neighborhood, on College, a block to the south as well as Duncan Park to the west are all beautiful, with old trees, old houses and flowers.
I grew up in Jacksonville, and lived there for my first 20 years. I was back to celebrate Easter with my sister and found this was open (and walking distance to her house). It's kind of expensive but compared to a hotel, except for the cheapies, on a holiday weekend it was reasonable. I would stay here again."

The following is a review of the suite by my daughter-in-law: “The mansion itself is beautiful and our suite was a great size. Beautiful ornate furniture in the bedroom, along with a baby grand piano. The bed was memory foam and very comfortable, despite being a double. It was very clean and they had complimentary bathroom items to use, as well as kitchen items to use, and a fridge stocked with water bottles. The building itself is old and easy to hear movement and conversations in the hallway. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would love to do it again!”"

I couldn’t have found a more perfect place for my first ever Airbnb stay. The unit looked just like the pictures on the website - gorgeous! The period furniture contributed to the historic ambiance. As I sat on the front porch each morning my mind would picture life in the 1800s as the accomplished families of Jacksonville went about their daily routines.
We arrived very late but accessing the unit was easy with the electronic lock (code was sent the day before we arrived). We had access to all the modern conveniences of the 21st century including cable television and Wi-Fi. The house is centrally located with convenient access to both MacMurray and Illinois College as well as a short 1 block walk to Duncan Park. If you are looking for a place to stay on your trip to Jacksonville, you can’t go wrong with the Ayers Mansion Airbnb!"

Easy access and location offers walkable options for meals or just walking around this very nice and historic town in central Illinois. Such a much more comfortable option compared to other lodging options. Highly recommend."

I wish we could’ve stayed longer to eat at the restaurant below but we arrived too late and left early the next morning. Had a nice stroll across the street at the park. Liz was very responsive and even placed a fresh container of ice and mineral water right before we got there.

Kevin was in the process of readying the prairie for the spring, however, he allowed my boys to pitch in and see how things work out in the country. I ended up extending my stay an extra day so that I could prepare for a long trip back to Texas and Kevin was more than accommodating. The house was clean and included all of the amenities we needed for a successful stay. Upon looking around we found many humorous hidden gems. We particularly liked the light switch to the White House. Kevin was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay the most comfortable possible. This was a godsend. I can't think him enough for the warm welcome and all the help he so graciously offered. it was a reminder to me there are truly wonderful people still in this world.

Stayed a few nights","Honeslty, I have a lost for words, because Kevin and Jaime's place really exceeded my expectations. I had no complaints. It's exactly what I was looking for and ended up having more! Their home is very beautiful, does not feel like a tiny home, alot more spacious than I imagined, but it kept the coziness of a small place. Super clean, very comfortable beds, and every thing you need to cook with, inlcuded spice, oils, and some extras. Not to mention the best homemade cookies I have had in a long time. The outdoor space feels like you are so far away and like your on a little piece of Heaven, it was so important for me to have this space for my dogs who I love more than life, to be able to run around, and this is exactly what they were able to do.
I will definetly be back, and I imagine it will be even more beautiful each different season.
The Hosts made sure I was ok and commuincative so quickly if I had any questions. Best HOSTS!"

Stayed with kids","This house is one to not miss. I absolutely had a blast brought a friend and my four-year-old grandson, there were tons of walking path all through the Prairie we met up with the owner, and he was so awesome, he took us on a little tour to a beehive which they have many beehives on the property. My grandson is four years old and he got to wear the beekeepers outfit and the owner opened up the beehive and showed us all about Bee’s. The beds are super comfortable futon. I laid on that and it was super comfortable. The house is super cute and has everything you could imagine that you might need. I cannot wait to go back and spend another week or a weekend at this house."

Stayed one night","Perfect place to spend July 4th. It was very quiet and the house stands in the middle of prairie and wooded area. It felt like Heaven. I picked fresh blackberries and bought some freshly harvested honey to have with my breakfast. Yummy! The fireflies put on a spectacular show, there were numerous kinds of birds to watch. There were many mowed trails that go through the prairie, forested area and near the ponds. The moon was beautiful that night, too. The second floor porch is a great perch to watch everything. I didn’t spend much time in the house and I was very comfortable the time I was indoors. I had some awesome warm chocolate chip cookies waiting for me when I checked in. Great place for a retreat from the city. Fantastic hosts that were very responsive to my needs and quick to reply to my questions/requests. Thank you for another fantastic stay, Kevin and Jaime! I’ll be back."

Along the way you will round a bend and come across a bench overlooking beautiful scenery. Keep going and you’ll find more benches ready for you to enjoy. It was nothing short of magical. A perfect weekend getaway from the world. Kevin and Jaime were fabulous hosts. Very responsive, provided all the essentials, and gave us space to enjoy their home with plenty of privacy.

I was looking forward to a starry night of sky watching, but had to be disappointed because a full moon stole the show. So, a night of seeing just how much you can see when the moon is your only light source. All to the sounds of the local pond, the nighttime birds, and whatever else is out there in the cornfields of rural Illinois.
This is a great place to get lost in."

We are so thankful that the Lord led us back to your place again, after our wonderful stay in 2018!
You both truly are gifted with hospitality, and are full of kindness! We are grateful for how kid- friendly your places are. We love The little book library and ones upstairs! And bought yummy honey! Even with our 3 young kids we had plenty of room!
Peace on the Prairie || is so peaceful and let us unwind before a busy road trip/funeral! It was easy to lean into the Bible verses said by Jesus
““Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”” Matthew‬ ‭11‬:‭28‬-‭30‬ ‭NIV
We are very grateful for both of you, & excited for whenever our next adventure there will be! We are also now looking forward to trying those peaches from IL! May God bless you both! Grace & Peace."

The land around the house has paths already cut through the tall grasses that allow you to wander until you’re done enjoying the quiet and are ready to head back to the house.
Kevin and Jaime provide all of the extra touches anyone can ask for. We can’t wait to come back in the spring as everything is beginning to bloom. Oh, when they say to bring groceries…bring groceries 😄"

The tiny home was extremely clean. Its obvious Jaime and Kevin truly enjoy being hosts. From every little tiny detail to special amenities, you could tell they care about the guests. I loved the coffee bar, the bookshelf, and telescope. The trails were easy to walk and very well kept.
This tiny house is the perfect place to unwind. It is so quiet and truly peaceful. You feel secluded and when all the lights are out at night, you can't see your hand in front of your face. I also loved waking up early just to watch the sun rise. It was such a magical experience.
Don't second guess booking this amazing tiny house. I promise it's exactly what you need."

Stayed with a pet","Serene retreat in farmland! Our party of five, including two adult couples, one teen, and a dog, stayed in Peace on the Prairie Too for one night on our way back to Arkansas from Wisconsin. The hosts were extremely responsive and accommodating as we communicated en route, adding the second couple to our reservation and arriving late. They even made extra cookies for us! The building is a very new and innovative two story tiny house, surrounded by flowers and fields. The master bed was super comfy. The wifi turned out to be an essential amenity, allowing our daughter to crank out assignments just in the nick of time. There is a washer and dryer available as well. We enjoyed a morning walk on the trails before heading out. Although they gave us detailed directions, it was a little tricky finding this house in the dark since it is out in the country after a series of twists and turns around corn fields, and tucked in a little bit off the road. I wish we could have stayed longer because it is so peaceful, quiet, and beautiful. I recommend this AirBNB to up to 5 people with or without pets, who love remote, private areas, and who do not have mobility issues."

You pull into a private drive, and the house is surrounded by plains…I did not see another house anywhere near. I surprised a deer when I pulled in, and stepped out to listen to a chorus of frogs and saw a sky filled with stars.
And Kevin and Jaimie’s communication was absolutely great-the best I’ve ever had.

Stayed with a pet",The house was very nice and clean. It had everything we needed and then some. There was plenty of stuff for the kids to stay entertained the good ol fashion way instead of just modern technology. The photos really dont do it justice. It’s much nicer in person. The bed… OMG! Super comfortable! It was the most relaxing weekend I’ve had in a while.

Bed is comfy, plenty of hot water and a well stocked kitchen (even provided coffee, creamer and spices). And of course homemade cookies were waiting on us when we arrived. As a side note you have to go to Heavenly Delight in town for an ice cream. Don't let the lines scare you away, it is worth the wait!!!"

It rained our whole time so we couldn’t get out as much as we wanted but we can’t wait to come back and explore more. However, since it rained we were able to stay in and be cozy and play games and watch movies on Netflix so that was perfect too. The second floor balcony was so sweet—a great view and very peaceful. We enjoyed the area too—went into Jacksonville a few times. It’s a great get-away!"

Stayed with a pet","Kevin and Jaime were tremendous hosts. We were traveling from just a couple hours away, but they kept us updated on road and weather conditions with the snow that had recently come in. I was super excited to find this gem that was close enough to home, but still far away enough to ""get away"". And they are super pet-friendly, which is hard to find (esp last minute). The upper loft was very spacious- truly gives a feel for tiny living, but in a big way. The upper balcony and lower windows were greatly enjoyed by our pup, who joined us on the journey. There were also a few trails on the property that we enjoyed. Kevin communicated with us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed, and we definitely had that and more!"

There are multiple trails on the property land for you to wander and a paradise for a dog to run free. For bird watchers there are plenty of opportunities; otherwise you can just enjoy the bird songs. During the night it is great to see the night sky without the light pollution.
Springfield is about 40 min drive, has plenty of nicest places to eat and entertain, also interesting historical places and great architecture. Jacksonville is about 15 min drive, has grocery and you can have a great stroll on State Street in historic district enjoying architecture of 1850-1900 houses and mansions.
Hosts are very welcoming, cookies were amazing!

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed in a good amount of Airbnbs and this has definitely been one of my favorites! Whether you're needing time away from the city or just passing through, I can't recommend Peace on the Prairie Too enough.
The house itself is really well designed. Even though it's a ""tiny house,"" you don't feel cramped at all and even have a king sized bed to sleep on. The hosts have lovingly labeled light switches, cabinets, drawers, and other misc. items to help guests, which is incredibly useful. They have books and board games available on top of the TV.
The land is beautiful. There are wildflowers everywhere, which you're able to walk through with the extensive pathways across the property. I went during a weekend where weather conditions were unfavorable for stars, but a ton of reviews mention those so I bet they're beautiful out there! My dog greatly enjoyed being able to run on the trails, off leash since there's really no traffic passing by.
I had the pleasure of meeting Kevin on my final morning and he's so friendly! The care and attention he shows for his guests is apparent not only in the little touches at the property that make it feel really homey, but it also shows through when you talk to him for even just a few minutes. I didn't have a chance to meet his wife but if she's anything like her homemade cookies that greeted me upon arrival, then I know she's sweet and pleasant as well.
All in all, this was an incredible experience with a well-rounded stay on all accounts. I'm already looking forward to a return trip!"

It was definitely big enough for my husband, teenage son and me. Kitchen had the basic stuff we needed to cook our food (we rarely eat out in general). We had a wonderful time taking long walks and playing hide and seek in the tall grass and exploring all the trails. It was just the peaceful quiet 2.5 days we needed. The view was gorgeous. Kevin was very attentive, accommodating and extremely responsive. Homemade cookies they left for us were scrumptious. Easy contactless check in and check out.

Stayed one night",Kevin and Jamie's place was a perfect stay and I wish I could've spent more time there. The home was very welcoming and nice and relaxing after a long day of traveling. I also enjoyed walking my dog in the prairie before I departed the next day. They even left homemade cookies which was much appreciated.
