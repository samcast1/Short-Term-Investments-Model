Stayed with kids","The house is beautiful and tucked away in it's own serene environment. Very, very peaceful. Our visit included 4 adults and 1 child. There was more than enough room for everyone. Each morning brought hundreds of birds singing to us, and squirrels and bunnies were fun to watch to. The pond was also fun for catch and release fishing, and we enjoyed taking a kayak out as well. Fires in the evening at the fire pit added to our enjoyment and contentment. The property really is amazing. In response to other reviews: it is in the country, but an easy ride back to Salem for anything needed. The water does come from a well but the smell did not bother us in the least and there is a water softener installed. The amenities overall were more than we could have asked for and all agree: we highly recommend staying at The Cove. If we could rate it more than 5 stars, we absolutely would."

Stayed a few nights","Very clean and comfortable. Property is lovely and would be great in the summer, with a pavilion and fire pit by a pond. Given the local options near Copeland Oaks, I would certainly stay there again.
Two relatively minor notes: The property has well water, which is not an issue, but they desparately need a better filtration system for the sulphur. The hot water especially smelled terrible. I live in a house with well water, so this is not just an issue of city vs. well. They did have filtered water for drinking through the fridge, which as acceptable, but showers in particular were moderately unpleasant.
The accommodations were relatively sparse and could use a couple of extra blankets/throws for cooler months."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay! Wonderful place, very clean and stocked well with the essentials. Rating this 4 stars as we feel there are a few things to note. The house is in a rural area, unfortunately the running water throughout the house is from a well. The water has a very strong sulfur smell when taking showers and washing dishes. We also found the beds were very very firm and uncomfortable. Overall a very nice place, however could be improved in some ways."

Stayed with kids","Staying at the cove was an awesome experience, everything was clean and pristine. There was a lot of things to do from relaxing on the beautiful balcony’s to fishing and kayaking we even did a little swimming in the beautiful pond on the property and in the evening you can relax and make a fire in the pit and roast some s’mores over the fire with the kiddos. Everything inside and outside the home was immaculate very clean organized, and looked wonderful along with the kitchen and bathrooms being stocked with everything you would need for a stay away from home. I will definitely be back for another stay anytime I’m in the area. Thank you Justin for the wonder experience!!!!! 5/5 rating in my book.. NO complaints here"

Stayed with kids","We rented this home for our annual extended family weekend. The pictures don't do this place justice in terms of space. It's beautiful inside! It is incredibly spacious and there are plenty of places to run away to for privacy. Check-in and out was very simple. There were a ton of amenities in the home include a garage full of arcade games, a large spacious basement with a pool table, bar, hot tub and giant tv. The only negative comments I have about this home is that there are lots of little things broken, however, the owner responded quickly to send someone out to try to fix the issues and they didn't impact our stay. We are excited about the additional bedroom being added and look forward to coming back to this home next year!"

Very nice to wake up and look right out into the woods. it is a wonderful porch area off of the living room in the woods. Laura was a great host. she let us use a couple of hers camping chairs and then we drove West to view the eclipse."

The living space was decorated beautifully and the view was breathtaking. Laura was a wonderful host and gave me the privacy that I so needed but was available if I needed anything. Check in and out was easy and access to the lower living space was easy for me since I recently just had knee replacement surgery. The space was very clean and stocked with everything you would need for your stay. I would not hesitate to recommend this lovely place!

The host provided a fire pit and grill, which we did not have a chance to use, but was a great addition. The amenities for meals we especially appreciated - spices, cooking oils, breakfast cereals and snacks. The host is not only responsive in communication, but genuinely cares about her guests."

Stayed a few nights","We highly recommend and enjoyed our stay at Laura’s wooded sanctuary. We were greeted by Laura and had a nice chat. The place was true to the pictures and explanation of the areas. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed having the sliding door open in the bedroom to feel the cool breeze and listening to the night sounds. It was nice to be in out in the country but close enough to town to easily pick up some necessities. If you’re looking for some fun we highly recommend stopping in for coffee at Lil’s Cafe and a wonderful shop called Nature + Nurture both in Salem, OH. Laura’s place was a perfect spot for us to come back to every night after a busy day out and about."

Stayed one night","A terrifying experience, a friend and I came out to relax and have a girls weekend, upon arrival we where excited, it was beautiful. And I had never done anything like this. We spent a couple hours getting food, taking pictures, and settling down, that’s when there a was loud sounds coming from outside, we went out and couldn’t see anything but heard what sounded like explosions going off, so loud that we could hear them inside with the tv turned up. Along with sirens and screaming. After over an hour of trying to drown out this noise around 12:00am we decided we are not safe and so we packed up and drove the almost 3 hours home. Nearly in tears. I was so let down seeing all of these incredible reviews…"

Stayed a few nights","The Moon is where our love for Kevin’s properties began four years ago, and it's in the same beautiful condition today. It's a beautiful contemporary home tucked in a pocket of old growth hardwood forest with a spectacular view of the ravine behind it. Less than a mile from downtown Salem, the parcel is reminiscent of a state park setting. The Moon sits juxtaposed to its sister, The Stars, and about 30 yards from Dreamcatcher, the newest of the Creekside Cabins. Kevin’s clever building placement and smart design features make it so you barely see the other properties. The interior is stylish, sparkling clean and comfortable. The fully equipped kitchen provides all you need for meal prep on-site. We actually modeled our own bedroom after the bedroom at The Moon. That’s how pretty it is. The rain shower head in the bathroom is hard to leave. The hot tub is a welcome newer addition to the property. After your first stay, you’ll be in love with The Moon like we are!"

You definitely will enjoy it....!!!!!"

Clean up was made simple with the dishwasher and laundry room amenities. Thank you! We'll definitely be back! Maybe next time, no teenagers. 😘🤣"

The deck is absolutely amazing. It feels as if you're nestled high in the trees, overlooking a gully. The beautiful leaf canopy above keeps the deck cool and comfortable for soaking in the hot tub, or daydreaming as the leaves dance with the sun on your face.
It was one of the best stays we've ever had. The Moon will be a yearly return for us. Thank you Kevin for hosting a cabin with such a magnificent layout and gorgeous feel to nature. It is perfect."

Everything was very clean and well maintained. I would highly recommend this place for any couple. IMO it would be a little crammed for more than 2 people. The bathroom can only be accessed through the Master bedroom.

The decor was impeccable, they were immaculately well cleaned, and fantastically equipped. It was a tremendous experience and true home away from home. Th Al you very much!"

We loved the country feel to it, had, such personable flair and touch, it made you feel right at home. The best AirBnB we have stayed in. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking, or baking. It has everything you need. The leftover you can bring down to the pet pig, that happily accepts it. Roxanne is a great host, she makes you feel welcome, and is very accommodating.

These folks are the ultimate host and on par with any host in the AirBnB system. As we travel extensively around the world, I can say this with some degree of certainty. Love the setting, the countryside, the home decor and especially Bob and Roxanne- the greatest. Job well done here folks!!!"

Roxanne has equipped her AirBnB with every imaginable item necessary for a traveler, every imaginable one. Probably the best AirBnB experience I have enjoyed over the past 6-8 years.
Congratulations Roxanne for going the extra mile, it is apparent that you have expended some serious thought and effort to make your AirBnB one of the most unique ones in the program.
Again, thanks! TomG"

Stayed with kids","So peaceful and great space for a family! Roxanne even purchased a pack n play when she found out we were coming with our 1 year old!! Absolutely beautiful and private farm. Enjoyed sitting on front porch with coffee/wine enjoying the quiet country surroundings. Kids loved the animals, especially lu lu the pig. Roxanne had a coffee maker set up with great coffee and tea options and tons of dishes and cookware for preparing meals at the house. Very comfortable space with cute country decor. Felt like a home away from home! Reminder to bring your own toiletries (shampoo and soap not provided). Also home is split/divided. It’s totally separate spaces but it is connected by a wall to the owners home so if you want total privacy this might not be perfect fit. That being said we had no issues with this and Roxanne was very friendly but also let us have our space. Would highly recommend and also return for a repeat stay next time we are in the area visiting family."

Stayed with kids","Roxanne was a wonderful host. She was very accommodating for us with an early check in and an offer to stay later! She popped in during the afternoon to set our heat for a day that promised to be chillier than May sometimes is. Pretty decorations and a lovely wood bed upstairs for parents with a beautiful quilt. We felt very welcomed as a transracial family with young kids. The kids had a great experience feeling at home during our visit. The kitchen had all we needed to do our meals, and there was plenty of room on comfy couches and a warm rug in the living room for lots of play and even a nap! The kids really loved the slide and walks around the house outside despite the rainy weather. Roxanne was very accommodating to leash her sweet dogs when a couple of our kids felt cautious to meet them, and they had fun saying hi to Jack from the doorway of his dry spot inside the barn. We are planning to return later in the season for any even longer stay and we hope next time they might be brave enough to pet the pig Lulu if she again greets us upon arrival from under the porch! She was a calm friend they talked about for hours and looked for on our walks. A quiet getaway (except for kid play!) we would recommend to any family."

We mostly used it as a base camp to explore the surrounding areas. The unit was very clean and private. My boyfriend and i enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub after our daily adventures. We liked that each unit had its own privaye jot tub. The town of salem had a nice little main street with more dining options than i thought there would be. We were able to check out a few local restaurants and the food and atmosphere was nice. I would recommend this place for a nice quiet getaway.

The attached car garage was a great feature as the weather was rainy and cold during our stay. Quality linen, new appliances in a well-equipped kitchen, made the place more special. I cannot stress the cleanliness of the entire space enough. You could eat off the floor if you wanted. Not a hair or speck of dust in sight! The private hot tub on the back deck was La crème and was a perfect 104 when we arrived. (Thanks Shelley!) When the beautiful dear stopped by the backyard for breakfast, I wanted to move in forever. The backyard was just as beautiful at night as someone took the time to give the trees landscape lighting. Thank you and your entire team for your attention to detail! We truly enjoyed our stay. This is what an Airbnb should be."

His construction and design is wonderful - always a perfect use of space, great furniture, great linens, and always a great location that is close to everything while feeling secluded. Always a deck and hot tub that overlook woods. I wish Kevin designed all AirBnBs as his properties are always great. Anytime we are in NE Ohio we find one of Kevin’s properties to stay in and are never disappointed - we have high expectations and they are always met and exceeded."

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect! It absolutely exceeded my expectations.
Things that I loved about the place...
there's a garage and a garage door opener remote that they supply you to put in your car. amazing.
the shower!! it was like being in a warm monsoon and I am all about that life.
hot tub was easy to uncover and use.
A GRILL! Made myself some yummy grilled corn one night.
shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion are provided.
there is a washer and dryer and they actually supplied soap and dryer sheets. it was so nice.
there are dishes to use as well as a Keurig. powdered creamer was provided. there was also oil and salt and pepper for those who want to cook.
a dishwasher! so wonderful. Soap for the dishwasher was also provided. so lovely.
The only thing about this place that I didn't love is that the walls are INCREDIBLY thin. This past week, my ears have witnessed so many things that I wish they could unhear.
But aside from thin walls...absolute perfection."

This particular place is definitely at the top of our list whenever we just want to get away . But I'm also happy to know that this particular host has other properties, and I will check them out the funny thing about it as me and my wife and I actually picking between this place and another place. That just so happened to be the same host. Nevertheless, beautiful clean, wonderful place. The pictures don't do it any justice ! And thanks again for being a great host ! the Morton's"

I was honestly worried about not having a full kitchen but with all the local restaurants and places in walking distance, we never had an issue on finding places to eat. Since we were staying for a longer period of time, Lawson was very proactive with picking up garbage and switching out towels half way through our stay to make sure we were comfortable! I have zero complaints and will for sure be staying here again!"

Stayed with kids","When I say this was the BEST Airbnb I have ever been to—and I have been to countless ones. This one was by far the best and absolutely beautiful with incredible accommodations. It was cozy, comfortable, and felt like a home away from home. Host was perfect and attentive before and after the visit. The view was perfect and close to the lake. We will definitely be back soon for summer! I highly recommend THE FRAME!!!!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend reserving The Henry and The Thomas if you are having a get together of 25 people or fewer. There is a small coutyard outside with tables and chairs for gathering. Our brother-in-law, wife and two children (young adults) stayed in The Henry and they said the accomodations were great with the one bedroom and pull out sofa. My husband and I stayed in The Thomas. Both places have full size refridgerators, dishwashers, microwaves and stoves/ovens. We had lunch for the group at Sabi’s (reserved a room and ate buffet style) and brought the leftovers back to eat later. Later, we warmed up our trays of chicken, pasta, mashed potatoes and carrots in our two ovens…ate…cleaned up and went, a short distance, some walked, to enjoy the concert that evening. After the concert, some walked, others rode back in the Model T’s provided with the reservation to our places and enjoyed marshmellows at the firepit in the courtyard. Everyone had a great time!"

Fun brewery, will be awesome when the BBQ restaurant opens. Bring a fan, the music can be a bit loud but not a huge problem, people are having fun. Can't wait to return! ❤"

We enjoyed the patio out front. And we truly appreciated not having to do anything but show up and then lock up when we left. It felt like renting a hotel vs. an Airbnb where you have to do all of these other things. Plus a noon check out! If we plan to be on the area again, we would definitely rent this Airbnb from Kevin again!"

Kevin had everything you needed plus the extra things you didn't think you needed. I stay at many places and never had such a quick response time from a host. The property sits right next to one of the best breweries around. The golf carts was an added touch to get to some great restaurants across the street. We will definitely be staying there again.

We were looking forward to going to the ill-will Brewery one night that we were there but unfortunately it's only open on the weekends. Only thing that we wished was different was just a heads up about the brewery only being open on the weekends, other than that place was amazing. And the model t golf cart was a lot of fun for my family and I."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time at "" The Henry"" and the surrounding space. It was very cool and different. We would certainly like to return later in the week or on a weekend with more of the property open for enjoyment including the on premise ill Will Brewery. We had the entire area to ourselves and the only thing missing was some available firewood our first night. We made do with a couple old pallets and some firewood we purchased nearby.
The Town Center looks to be very enjoyable when in full swing and it has a great Mexican Bar and Grill called ""Mexico City"" and The Burger Joint ""Sespe"" was fantastic. We also tried frozen yogurt at Orange Leaf which was a very fun place with a number of options to choose from including the frozen yogurt, boba tea and acai bowls.
The accommodations were wonderful and a few times I reached out to Kevin through AirBnB he responded almost immediately. We certainly want to experience a few of his other places that are listed as well.
Highly recommend!"

The couch was comfortable enough for some binge watching and the high ceilings make you feel as though you are in a big space, not that the space is small in the first place. Both TVs are equipped with a sound bar which was great for watching TV or listening to your playlist
The linens and bed were so comfortable and there were extra blankets to cuddle with as well.
In the evening, I took advantage of the hot tub, local restaurants, and the Beer/Cigar bar. I highly recommend Sabi's for dinner, Birdfish Brewery for Sunday afternoon on the patio, and the Brewhouae at Firestone Farms.
Excellent stay, looking forward to coming back."

Stayed with kids","This place was simply awesome! We are big fans of The Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Michigan, so finding a Henry Ford themed Airbnb was a dream come true!! We had a such a wonderful stay here, and really enjoyed this little town. The historic downtown had cute shops with such friendly customer service. We had a great breakfast at Carla’s Corner Cafe located inside an antique store ( can’t remember the name, but it was fun to browse while we waited for our food.) Our host was friendly and responsive, and this place was cozy and immaculately clean. Can’t wait to visit again!"

We enjoyed having a private hot tub and the closeness of good restaurants. The keurig in the kitchen was perfect for a morning cup of coffee. It was pretty cold during our stay so we barely used the golf cart, but the thing was amazing: it looked like an Model T!
Kevin was very proactive and helpful in the lead up to our stay."

Stayed a few nights","When was the last time you stayed at an Airbnb with its own Model-T for you to cruise the neighborhood in? Kevin’s Columbiana property The Henry and its next-door neighbor The Thomas have changed the game when it comes to experiential stays.
Electric golf carts built to replicate Ford’s famous Model-T are available for guests to drive around the Firestone Farms community, golf course and shops. What a fun and unique investment Kevin has made in his guests’ experience! We enjoyed an hour-long drive on a sunny autumn afternoon and loved watching the surprised reactions of out-of-towners and the knowing waves of familiar residents as we passed.
Named for Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, the exteriors of these nostalgic properties are replicas of these historic figures’ boyhood homes. To fully appreciate the homage to Ford and Edison, do a quick internet search for the pair’s annual “Vagabonds” road trips with Harvey Firestone (a Columbiana native) and the famed naturalist John Burroughs. Or you can read the authoritative book about the troupe that Kevin has provided on the living room table.
Upon entering the house, we were struck by the larger-than-life mural of Henry Ford leaning on the bumper of his history-making automobile. If you stay at enough of Kevin’s properties, you’ll learn that most of them have a similarly breathtaking central wall mural or contemporary furnishing designed and crafted by local artist John Shaw. They are yet another hallmark of Kevin’s unique places.

In contrast to the historically accurate exterior, the interior is anything but dated. High vaulted ceilings, sunlight-ushering windows, a stylish and comfy sofa bed, sleek kitchen cabinets and high-end appliances give the great room a warm and contemporary feel. The bedroom features luxurious linens on a sleep-inducing king bed, a dresser with plenty of drawers to stow your clothes and touch lamps fashioned to resemble period pieces with Edison-style filament light bulbs. Each of the rooms have various lighting options including infinitely dimmable ceiling light fixtures.
The bathroom boasts a black onyx tiled walk-in shower with the most intense rain showerhead my wife and I have ever experienced.
Outside is an expansive red brick patio area with brick inlays in the shape of a Model-T in front of The Henry and a light bulb in front of The Thomas. Brick fire rings provide a great gathering area to enjoy with family or your new friends from next door or the adjacent Ill Will Brewing, where you can enjoy eclectic brews with names like “Questionable Life Choices,” “Toxic Workplace” and “Backhanded Compliment.” We personally recommend their ""Genoskwa"" stout named after the native American term for “Bigfoot,” for which Columbiana is said to be a hotbed for sightings.
You’ll enjoy unwinding in the relaxing top-of-the-line hot tub after a long day of experiencing The Henry and its surroundings.
As bona fide followers of Kevin Jamison properties, we have been conditioned for increasingly higher expectations with each new offering. The Henry met and exceeded those expectations as anticipated. My wife owns a commercial cleaning business, so it takes on-point cleaning staff and attention to every detail to impress her, which The Henry does with a perfect score.
Kevin is a responsive communicator who is always available for questions, but non-intrusive as he allows his guests to enjoy their stay without interruption.
You can’t go wrong with a stay at The Henry. It will surely lead to return visits. If you’re anything like us, you will find yourself planning stays where Kevin’s homes are the destination and the reason for the trip."

My partner is a three pillow sleeper and I deeply appreciated that there were extra linens provided and accessible which is exceptionally generous and thoughful. all of the appliances are new and work amazingly wellThe theme of this particular property was fun and executed spectacularly. It carries through the entire property without being forced or too much. and as a curvy woman I deeply appreciated that all of the furniture was of sound construction and well built. (there is nothing worse than showing up to realize you are afraid to sit wrong on the couch bc it's a futon. that's NOT anything you have to worry about with Kevin's property!) Kevin was also very responsive to messages and quick to answer a few questions I had. I will definitely be staying with Kevin again!!!"

The map that is provided shows you exactly where you are allowed to drive it, and I was pleasantly surprised at how many places you can go with it. And the brewery right next door is just the icing on the cake. I will most definitely be back but will stay longer next time.

There was so much detail and heart and soul put into it by the owners. We didn’t want to leave!
We enjoyed driving the Ford replica golf cart around the whole subdivision grounds including great restaurants and bars. The courtyard at the shopping mall has free concerts every Saturday night! It is located on the same property as Ill Will Brewery! Great beer and super friendly people! Would love to stay again! Thank you for a great stay Columbiana!!"

A warm and cozy gas fire added to the atmosphere of Christmas as well as a wide screen tv with Christmas music and a decorated, lit tree!
The setting was perfect, the front porch and rockers inviting and our visit so peaceful and memorable!
At our request, Aimee suggested wonderful restuaruants, flea markets and thrift shops and things to see. We went to all of them!
The kitchen is very small but adequate as we did not plan to cook. Aimee even left a welcome bag and contacted us each day to see if we had any requests.

Stayed a few nights","Do not hesitate to book this place! Aimee was a phenomenal host and was super responsive and kind. It was so much fun to kayak and hang out by the lake! super relaxing trip. I recommend to bring and food or supplies you need before getting here. the closest giant eagle was about 20 mins away. not bad, but just might be helpful for others. We loved it so much we asked Aimee to stay an extra day and she allowed us to, thank you Aimee for such a wonderful trip! the cabin was super clean and adorable."

The fish we're jumping out of the water, and there were a lot of different birds to watch. The sunsets over the lake are spectacular.

Kitchen is small, but we were able to cook with no problem. No dishwasher, but we didn’t mind. The lake was beautiful, calm, relaxing and easily accessed. Close to a small grocery store and restaurants. Hosts were extremely hospitable and communication was timely and helpful."

Stayed with kids","My 1st impression when I walked in the door was “how cute”. It would be perfect for a small family or friends gathering. Kitchen was tiny but perfect for our needs. Love the bathroom with the huge walk-in shower. It was extremely hot outside (90 degrees, high humidity) when we stayed, so there was no hanging out on the cute porch or patio. The cabin was plenty cool enough as long as you leave the doors open and let the air circulate. It is a cabin, not a house and the ability to provide an air-conditioned environment to guest is awesome! Aimee has done a great job at providing everything.
Unfortunately, our family included our 2 grandchildren who are 4 years old & 18 months. Not ideal for babies and small children. One bedroom upstairs is an open loft and very comfy and does not have a door, but I liked it! The downstairs bedroom is very small with double size bunkbeds. It was way too hot to close the door or use the top bunk during the scorching summer heat. Our babies missed their bath time; and quiet place to sleep. Totally not Aimee’s fault, I knew there was no tub. So, with that said, if you love staying in a cabin, near the lake with fishing, swimming, and hiking, come here."

We loved all of the beds —- they are sooooo comfortable. The electric fireplace was the perfect touch for the cold winter weather. We drove to Salem for takeout food & it was very easily accessible from the cabin. We hope to return in the summer months so we can properly enjoy the lake. Highly recommend Aimee & Jerry’s cabin."

The self check in was easy! The place was clean, beds comfortable and had plenty of amenities. We took advantage of the Roku tv and had Netflix going all weekend while we played games and just enjoyed getting away.
This will definitely be a great place to use in the summer with all the activities at the lake or just relaxing out on the front deck!"

Beautiful living spaces, large bed, incredible shower let alone they both had washer and dryer, hot tubs and handy Model T Ford replica golf carts to utilize exploring the area. We took full advantage of all the amenities and our friends were amazed and many of them want to rent these properties in the future. Did I mention the fire pits and there is a beautiful courtyard just outside the back doors that connects to a local brewery and farm market? We all had an amazing time and the general consensus is that we want to make this an annual event. Many thanks to Kevin on these very upscale and impressive units."

Fourth, the outside patio, near a local brewery was pleasant all day long. And, fifth, Columbiana is a Hallmark(esque) town, with a beautiful Park and quaint downtown. The Airbnb is certainly worth checking out - you won’t be disappointed."

The interior is beautiful, clean, and well appointed. I couldn’t stop looking at the unique decor. The shower with waterfall shower head was so relaxing. We had a beautiful night to use the very clean hot tub. There was a new grill which we didn’t get to use. The golf cart was so much fun. We enjoyed riding on the property (map included to show the route you are allowed to take). People would wave and yell “nice buggy”. Kevin was quick to respond and very helpful suggesting restaurants. We enjoyed the Homestead and Sabi. Stopped in Mexico City for a drink and met very nice people. Next time we’d like to stay more than one night. We had such a relaxing visit and it was difficult to leave. But, we headed to The Dreamcatcher (another one of Kevin’s properties which is equally amazing) for one more night."

Stayed a few nights","The place out-did the pictures. Ultra modern, the motif was of the historical Thomas Edison. It almost reflected what might have been his laboratory, but with a giant twist toward livability. All rooms were provisioned impeccably; we wanted for nothing. The coffee maker was new to us; it would make a cup or a pot-full equally well. We usually cook many of our meals; the full range of necessities were at our finger tips - all new!! Plenty of light during the day (if desired), but shaded from it in the morning,allowing sleep-in’s as late as desired. The shower was not only huge, but a delight. Plenty of storage, if needed, and plenty of clothes hanging space if multiple functions are on the agenda. The HVAC worked flawlessly for setting a comfortable atmosphere and the jacuzzi was the crowning jewel (wish we had used it more than twice!!!"

The beer was insanely good. Milkshake beers thats didnt even taste like beer, along with your typical ipas ect. Try the peabutter chocolate it will change your life.
Next up was check in. He gave us a the information we needed before check it ans made it as simple as possible.

First and foremost this host was so incredibly kid, compassionate, and generous. During an evacuation situation in my town where I was left homeless these locations felt right at home. The decor was impeccable, they were immaculately well cleaned, and fantastically equipped. It was a tremendous experience and true home away from home. Th Al you very much!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at “The Thomas” for two nights during a trip to explore Columbiana County. This accommodation is spotless, stylish, and beautiful. Self check-in was a breeze using a keypad and the host was very communicative from our initial booking onward. The Thomas is located across the road from Firestone Farms, which is a neat entertainment district with nice restaurants and bars. We hiked in nearby Beaver Creek State Park and enjoyed the local food scene including the wonderful Hogan’s Bakery, Homestead Restaurant, and local craft breweries. In fact, “The Thomas” is located on the same grounds as Ill Will Brewing - a very stylish craft brewery with very good beer. Other fine nearby craft breweries to check out are Birdfish in Columbiana and Numbers in Lisbon. Nearby, The Leetonia Beehive Coke Ovens Park, which is on the National Register of Historic Places is an interesting historic site. Walking through the archaeological remains of this site ( built in 1866) is fascinating and atmospheric. There is also the Liittle Beaver Creek Greenway rails to trails route for cyclists. We live 90 minutes away in Cleveland and the Thomas makes for a splendid weekend getaway both because of the quality of accommodations and the wealth of activities. We will return."

This was such a wonderful experience with the bonus of a spotless facility. I have been to several airbnbs in the past and none have compared to the cleanliness and security of this one! Everything we could have ever needed or wanted was provided for us in the “home” as well. Thank you so much to Kevin for the information and assistance with booking and navigating us through this experience!

It’s tucked away on a quiet street and is within walking distance of Heggy’s! There’s was something so familiar about the place that made me feel nostalgic. It felt like home.
I usually book a hotel, but as long at this place is available during my visits, I will definitely be booking again and will recommend to friends and family when they’re heading to town.
Fun fact: I actually learned about this house from my cousin Amilia who stayed last year around this time."

Stayed a few nights","Jeremy is a great host and we enjoyed our stay. Upstairs beds were comfortable, but the ceiling is quite low and was a bit challenging for my older (adult size) kids to move around. Aside from that, the place was super clean and we felt safe in the neighborhood. Porch was a nice bonus with the comfortable rockers out front!"

Everything in the house was really clean and there were 2 extra beds upstairs which I did not use since I was by myself. Other than that the area and neighborhood is really quite.

The furniture and beds were very comfortable. We especially liked sitting on the front porch and at the picnic table in the back. Jeremy was very responsive and accommodating. It was a great value. We would definitely stay here again if and when we get back to the area."

Stayed a few nights","Cute bungalow! Home is small (1 bedroom with attic) but worked great for husband & I and 2 kids (ages 20 & 14). Very clean, nicely decorated, comfy beds & linens, easy to find (just off State St), quiet neighborhood. We have family in the area so we didn't spend a lot of time in the home - but it was a nice place to sleep, shower & have bkfast & then go out for the day. Much better than a hotel room! Jeremy was responsive to our questions. We'd love to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Very clean private bungalow home! I rented this cozy adorable home for my elderly parents. The home is exactly as described. It is located in a safe and quiet neighborhood. My parents were able to park by the front door and because there isn’t any stairs to climb, they were able to easily access the house. The home has a comfortable queen bed and bathroom located in the first floor. There is a lovely backyard and Jeremy provided extra amenities such as coffee, condiments and snacks. The central air was greatly appreciated during their summer stay. They traveled to my sister’s home which was only a mile away and spent all day there. They were very comfortable arriving back at the house during the night as the neighborhood is quiet and safe. There is local eatery, Heggy’s right down the road which they enjoyed getting coffee and some candy. This is a great place to stay, and the value is outstanding! So much better than staying in a hotel."

We went hiking at Brandywine Falls and we went to two different winerys. One in Akron and one in Hartville. We also shopped at a wonderful market so it was great having a full kitchen. He has two great spots to sit outside. The house is adorable and cozy. It was the perfect girls' weekend and I would definitely stay here again when we come up north!!"
