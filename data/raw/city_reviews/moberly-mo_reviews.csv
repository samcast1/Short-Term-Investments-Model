Stayed over a week","Wonderful place to stay, especially if you love the outdoors. Many wonderful animals on the property that are friendly to interact with. The house is clean and looks exactly like the photos. Situated in a peaceful rural area. The hosts are wonderful people and readily helped me out with anything I needed. They are also quick to respond. Overall great place."

Stayed a few nights","I would stay here again! The description is accurate, the wifi worked well and the hosts & animals are very friendly. The water pump (?) was loud when I turned on the water, which startled me the first time, but isn’t a big deal. Great place for the price point. Everything was cozy and felt safe for a solo female traveler"

Stayed a few nights","Disappointed. My wife and I love to travel and visit off the grid and unusual places. But we expect two things from Airbnb locations. Clean and comfortable. This place was dusty and the bathroom was impossible to make it clean and sanitary. The ""compost toilet"" was a 5 gal plastic bucket under the seat of an old chair. The ""lid"" was a rough, unsealed board that could never be sanitized because of the nature of the wood. The lid would not stay up on it's own, you had to hold it or have it lean against your back. We've used compost toilet's in the past, but nothing like this. If the seat could be sanitized it would be different, but this could not be. This location would be great for the spring thru fall but is not suitable for the winter. The little window unit AC ran constantly trying to heat the room and was VERY noisy. It was not large enough to adequately heat the room. It was so loud it made sleeping very difficult. It ruined any of the expected ""peace and quiet."

Stayed one night","Beautiful place in a beautiful area! It was so peaceful. Mary was a lovely host and described everything perfectly in the listing. There’s a great pyrenees named Salvador and he greeted us with a wagging tail and a huge smile. There was also a cat that wanted to be around us that snuck into the bnb and our car which was hilarious. The cat let us pick it up and plop it back out into its own domain. The only thing I wasn’t a fan of was the bed, I woke up with a tight and sore neck (it was super soft and I like a hard mattress but that’s just a personal preference) but other than that this place was absolutely perfect."

Stayed over a week","The place took some getting used to but was overall pleasant stay. Hauled water system makes many noises, most of which are no cause for alarm. Mary was helpful and communicative, responded quickly which was appreciated but some additional ready info could have made things a lot smoother. Can't weigh in on the shower/tub as I never used it. I had family nearby so just used theirs since the water was quite loud and I wasn't clear on how much I could use so didn't feel comfortable. The bed was comfy but sheets and blankets could all have done with a thorough wash as some had noticeable pet smells and stains. Generally though, the house was comfortable and had all the necessary amenities. WiFi was good. All the animals on the property were lovely and friendly, dog, cats, and chickens all wander around in the yard nearby and some even come up for a cuddle."

Stayed with a pet","My husband & I brought our 7 year old son to the farm to give him a special one on one experience before we welcome our 2nd child in a couple months. My son fished the pond for HOURS catching bluegill after bluegill. My husband & I even indulged in a bit of catfish fishing ourselves. We fed the fish & watched them come up to feed. We also loved on the farm animals at the fence. Heather also brought us in the pen with her. My son got to interact with the goats and the donkeys, feeding them by hand. She taught us some pretty cool stuff about the goats, donkeys, chicken & Turkey. We visited the local Amish Community which was an experience for all of us. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Heather & her husband were very kind, welcoming & responsive when we reached out. My son is already talking about bringing his new baby sister so she can have the same special experience. :)"

They also loved the cat and the dogs . My grandson saw a catfish in the pond and called it a monster. We also did a day trip to the covered bridge, Mark Twain's birthplace and an Amish community along with playgrounds of course. The restaurants we ate at were delicious. The ""holiday house"" as my granddaughter called it exceeded all our expectations and the kids loved the rain head shower. The house had everything we needed and more."

Stayed a few nights","Heathers place is just perfect, it is as pictured in the photos, everything you need is there and of high quality. Its super clean, easy to access and really made our weekend a perfect one. The property is a beautiful farm with donkeys, goats and chickens. We loved a dog name Kono that would greet us every time we pulled up and would be very playful and fun. Heather and her husband are great people and very helpful with any info you might need. It is one of the best places we stayed in and I would not have 1 think to recommend changing, it is one of the most though out and executed rentals we ever visited. Wish other owners would take as much time and pride to make their places as nice and pay a little more attention to detail as it was done here. Hopefully we can return for a longer stay in the future. Heather, I wish your family all the best and hope you guys stay healthy and happy for many years to come."

Stayed with kids","I wrote and edited this review many times. I wanted to write a book about how fantastic our visit was, and the impact it had on my family, but I will do my best to sum it up.
This was everything our family needed and more! I travel significantly for work and have seen my fair share of hotels, rentals and all other forms of stays. Your host(s) will far exceed your expectations of the ideal host. We feel like they were our long-lost friends. The location and lodgings are amazing. Squeaky clean, soft beds, amazing shower, and the scenery is beautiful. We took family walks multiple times throughout the day to say HI to all the animals and just connect as a family. IT WAS PERFECT.
If this is in your trip Wishlist's and you are working through your decision, let me help.... BOOK with Heather, get outside, connect with nature, spend the time with your friends, family and just soak it all in and thank me later. GRIT AND GRACE will forever be a part of us and in our hearts!"

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I, and our two pups, stayed at Grit & Grace Lodge for three nights for our anniversary, and we loved it! The space was beautiful and relaxing, and the high ceilings and rustic, simple décor made it feel open and welcoming. Even though it's in close proximity to the host's home, it felt very private.
The kitchen was current and well appointed, to include fresh roasted coffee beans and a grinder! We had everything we needed to make some great meals, and it was especially nice to have Prenger grocery store only 4 miles away to pick up anything we needed.
The bathroom was clean and spacious, had ample amenities, and the huge shower with the waterfall showerhead was wonderful after a long day of being out-and-about! We also appreciated having the washer and dryer available.
There were two bedrooms, each thoughtfully decorated and cozy. With it just being the two of us, we used one to sleep in each night, and the other as a makeshift closet and to keep our bags organized. If you're traveling with a larger group who may need to use the second bedroom for sleeping, you may want to be aware that it is essentially a finished garage - with a functioning lift door and everything - with a bed, rug, and chair. It didn't bother us in the least so it did not impact our rating at all, but it was pretty chilly in that room at night. Also, be aware that the floors throughout the lodge are sealed concrete, which was wonderful for the pups, but they are chilly as well. Bring slippers, and you won't even notice!
We thoroughly enjoyed walks with our dogs around the pond path in the early mornings and at sunset, and we enjoyed feeding the fish on the lovely dock, and taking them for walks around the farm to see the friendly goats and highland calf. It was an added treat when the hosts met us outside one day to talk about the farm, and let us into the pen to feed the goats and interact with the animals! We loved it! They also had a very nice corn hole set outside.
If you don't mind meandering drives down pretty country roads (we recommend doing so with the windows down and blaring your favorite tunes!), the lodge is also in nice proximity to Mark Twain Lake and the Union Covered Bridge, which was breathtaking to see with the surrounding Fall foliage. We even drove into Hannibal to visit the Folklife Festival and have dinner one day, and didn't at all mind the miles in between!
One night when we arrived back at the lodge, we found that the hosts had built us a fire in the fire pit and set out two chairs for us to enjoy it. The sky was clear and full of stars....it was so thoughtful, and we appreciated it so much!
The only other thing I can think to mention would be to prepare to entertain yourself, and you'll thoroughly enjoy this stay! There is only one TV in one of the bedrooms, and it is a smart TV with streaming only. That said, while we were there, the internet and WiFi were out for the duration of our stay, so there was essentially no TV. In that area, it's also hard to come by a cell signal, so if you are hoping to check emails, send/receive important texts, access social media, etc., you may not be able to until you're off-site a ways. Again, this did not bother us at all (we actually enjoyed the “detox”…lol) so it didn’t impact our rating, and the hosts were very apologetic and tried everything they could to get it fixed while we were there. They were extremely responsive, accommodating, and kind, and we wouldn’t hesitate to book another stay at Grit & Grace!
If you’re looking for a relaxing, pet-friendly stay in a country setting with everything you need to unplug and get away from crowds and traffic, this is it!"

Stayed a few nights","Heather is an outstanding host. The accommodations are impeccably clean and well-stocked (I brought a pie plate to make a quiche. There was one already there!) The beds are super comfortable--not too soft and not too hard. There's a spectacular shower with a rain showerhead, but more importantly, great water pressure. All the basics are met, even for the persnickety guest like me. So let me tell you about the extras this place has to offer. You instantly feel at home when you pull up the driveway. Situated just a few minutes from Mark Twain Lake there are lots of things to do in the area. The wildlife is abundant, but if you miss it in the park, Grit and Grace has plenty! Feeding the fish in the evenings was relaxing and peaceful. Hearing the rooster in the morning while enjoying a cup of coffee, and watching the goats play only added to the serene atmosphere. Did I mention the coffee? The host also owns a coffee shop and has a special blend at Grit and Grace waiting for you. But the most important thing was that, since this was a sister's weekend retreat, we felt safe the moment we pulled in. We slept well the first night there. If you love to travel for getaways, but that first night is always an adjustment, Grit and Grace is a place you should consider. Seriously, one of the best places I've ever stayed!"

The sunsets there were so peaceful while we got to hear wildlife sing to us. Dave & Heather are amazing to communicate with & always responded to our texts. Grit & Grace was exactly what we needed to recharge & calm the American busy life to a slow pace for a few days."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for a motorcycle trip. Heather and David have a great place. They are very accommodating for out trip needs with the bikes. Our son(9) had a blast fishing in the pond, and getting to pet the goats and see the other animals. It was a nice change of pace for us for a few days. The lodge is beautiful and has everything you ever need. Fully stocked kitchen, bathroom is amazing that shower is awesome. The lodge is close to a grocery store and other little restaurants in Paris. Heather and David truly did an amazing job with this place. We would definitely come back if our trips ever bring us to that side of the state again."

Stayed with kids","This place is so perfect, I almost don't want to tell anyone about it because I want to keep it to myself. 😊
Grit and Grace Lodge is a refuge and a balm. We stayed two nights and could easily have stayed for a week. The lodge is excellently appointed, Heather is a terrific communicator, the catch and release fishing was great, and oh my the animals! Silly goats nibbling at our shirts, gentle donkeys nuzzling our hands, baby cows with their soft fur, hilarious guineas strutting their stuff, a rooster with a broken alarm clock, and giant lapdogs.
This place was literally a dream come true for my family."

Stayed a few nights","Heather and Dave’s Airbnb is absolutely top-notch, I cannot recommend their place enough. It is super clean and ridiculously charming. As soon as you walk in you feel like you are at home. The beds were very comfortable and the temperature was perfect. It was obvious that they take a lot of pride in hosting.
But by far the best part was all the other furry hosts that help Heather and Dave make your stay as memorable as possible. They have goats, dogs, cows, guineas (I had no idea these existed until now), roosters, chickens, and probably others that I am forgetting. Heather and Dave are super nice and were kind enough to take us into the pin so that we could meet each of the animals and even explained a lot of about each of them. It was definitely a great experience. If I am ever in the area again, I know where I am staying."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful overnight stay at Grit & Grace Farm! We arrived at dusk and were able to see Heather bringing out feed for the calves. We so enjoyed getting to pet and feed the goats, as well as visiting the donkeys and cow. There’s also a small pond and dock with fish food. Our stay was comfortable, and we were happy to find a couple games to play since the WiFi was down that night (but really no complaints on no WiFi or service—we all need a break from it). The Airbnb itself was very charming, and the shower is awesome! Plenty of extra blankets. I highly recommend Heather’s place and hope we can return for a longer stay!"

Loved every minute of our stay…beautiful decor, stocked kitchen, comfy bed with fireplace, relaxing shower, perfect fire pit while playing Bags & delicious Holy Grounds coffee to drink while sitting on the dock overlooking the pond.
We picked this location to be close to Mark Twain Lake for fishing for our boys. Turned out the fishing in the stocked pond was even better! The farm animals with the baby goats was an added bonus! We all fell in love with them & enjoyed all the snuggles!
Would absolutely recommend the lodge retreat to anyone wanting to spend some quality time with family & get in touch with nature!"

The location is great if you're visiting Mark Twain Lake. The animals are a definite bonus and during our visit, there were 4 new baby goats! Perfect timing! One thing to note is that paper products (including toilet paper) cannot be flushed due to the type of sewer system. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and Paris, Mo is a cute little town!"

Stayed one night","I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb properties all across the country, but Heather and Dave’s little ranch is probably my favorite so far!
They are wonderful hosts, who just naturally are suited to provide everything you need for an amazing experience. The venue is brand new, super cute, very trendy, very clean, and very comfortable. The bed and bedding were so soft and snuggly, slept like a baby. I felt so welcome there, like family. Heather has thought of every little detail… how did she know I would forget my toothbrush? (and have extras just waiting there for me to pick my favorite color?)
We loved grinding our own coffee beans for an aromatic brew… simply delish!
We could’ve brought all the food we needed to cook a gourmet dinner, because her kitchen was fully appointed to support that, but we enjoyed a wonderful Mexican meal in nearby Paris! Besides the beautiful experience of getting to know our hosts and connect with them…….. the caveat of having the opportunity to interact with all of their adorable farm animals, was heart-warming.
I LOVE ALL OF THEM.
This was such a memorable experience I give it a “10 PLUS!”
I hope to be back to pet all of the furry critters!
Thank you, Heather and Dave! ♡︎♡︎♡︎"

Not only did we enjoy visiting with the animals each day and feeding the fish, but we went into town a couple of times to check out the Farmers Market and pick up food from local restaurants. Heather had great communication with us the entire time and could not have been a better host. We hope to return for another visit soon!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was amazing. I don’t even have enough time to write about all the things I enjoyed. But I will share some of the highlights.
The communication with the host was totally on point. Booked this a few days in advance to break up a long drive to Colorado. I now plan to try and stay here every time I have to make this drive.
Description 100% accurate. There were no surprises. It was perfect.
Pull thru driveway. Was amazing since we had a uhaul with a trailer and another vehicle!
The bed was very comfortable and cozy.
The pond out back was great with fishes and a mowed little trail to walk around it.
The animals were the best part! I grew up on a farm and have a farm of my own now. And the the animals were all so fun to watch. I woke up in the morning and saw the goats hanging out on their playground. That was a first for me and I loved it.
I really fell in love with with this spot and I stay at a lot of Airbnb’s. I am thankful to have found it and all the small extras inside the lodge were amazing. Will definitely be back!!!"

My only complaint is that I feel like it wasn’t cleaned very thoroughly beforehand, at least detailed clean. The bathroom and floors were clean but it was very dusty and there was some dead ants on a random shelf in the bathroom. But overall very wonderful place and it’s a great area to get away for the weekend"

Stayed a few nights","This place was a bit hard to find after dark, which was when I arrived. I noticed some pet hair on the floor when sweeping it at the end of my stay. Overall this place worked great! One suggested improvement would be easy pull window blinds in the front kitchen windows. The curtains that are there don't seem real handy to use, and it would add to the privacy to be able to cover those windows. The cabin is great for the price and has a nice bathroom and laundry room."

Stayed a few nights","A solid four stars, though if I could give it a 4.5, I would!
Pros:
-The hosts were very responsive, responded quick, and super helpful.
-Instructions for getting here were clear, and check in was a breeze.
-It was the cutest little place, perfect for a small family!
-Water was great, wifi worked well, projector was strong, everything was running as it should be and this place matches the descriptions perfectly
-For being a barn far away from the city, there weren’t that many bugs!
Cons
-This barn is in the backyard of the owners house, and they have two dogs. I went outside and stepped in some dog poop that was right in front of our door in the grass so, not a huge fan.
-The beds aren’t that accessible, and it was kind of scary. I understand that some places, the bed are higher up, but it would be nice to have some kind of safety fence or something installed, even for just peace of mind.
-There were some ants inside the barn. Not a huge deal breaker, but a heads up."

Stayed with kids","This place looked like the photos and was very cute. It was creatively designed and space well used. We enjoyed watching a movie on the projector and stayed warm and cozy on a 28° night. The hosts had thought of everything, washer, dryer and kitchen. Plenty of cozy blankets available for our family of 4!
The only downsides: The larger of the 3 mattresses left my husband and I’s feet hanging off the bottom even though we are only 5ft 7”-5ft 9”. Some of the outlets had no face plates on them in the loft side where our kids were sleeping, leaving some safety concerns for us. Also if you have younger kids I would carry the twin mattresses down to the first floor, the drop off is considerable and there is no safety railing. There was some expired food in the fridge and kitchen cabinet. But it was a very clean kitchen even with that.
If you mind a train whistle at night this place is not for you. If you are used to it or even enjoy it, it’s perfect!"

My only issues were things they couldn’t control like weather, flies, and the cows being gone 😞lol They were extremely accommodating and very very nice. Since I was there to work on my book, I did not really explore the area or sit outside much. I was pretty much glued to my computer, so I really enjoyed it indoors. I will say if you are a person that has to pee a lot in the middle of the night staying in that loft is not very fun because you have to climb up and down each time. I’m too much of a zombie to do that safely. 🤪 That was something I did not think about before booking. However they do have air mattresses and the couch which is extremely comfortable. 😉 The bed in the loft was surprisingly soft though."

Stayed one night","O’s Barn Cabin was a perfect last minute get away for an anniversary trip. With three kids and jobs it’s often difficult to find time to connect. The Barn offered exactly that much needed time.
Aaron was gracious and let us check in an hour early so we can get settled. The cabin is rustically decorated and comfortable. Though we didn’t use it, other than to check the football and baseball scores, the projector tv is fun!
We were really interested in an evening around the fire pit. While we went to an early dinner, Aaron retrieved some excellent fire wood for us to burn.
We highly recommend Lula’s Tavern for dinner. They offer a limited menu of steak, seafood and burgers, but well worth it. They open at 4 pm. Get there when they open or you will be waiting. It’s a place with great character and you walk in and you instantly feel like family. Everyone knows each other! Heads up, like any family, they only take cash or checks.
We returned from our dinner and had a wonderful evening by the fire and watching shooting stars into the night.
Thank you Aaron!"

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I had so much fun staying here! We really enjoyed the projector and the privacy this place offers- sometimes you'll hear the train in the distance, but otherwise perfectly peaceful. The porch offered a lovely view in the mornings (although sadly no cows spotted), and I found the couch to be really comfortable to sleep on. There are also air mattresses readily available. Really appreciated the hosts' hospitality in their willingness to answer any questions and provide anything we needed; they were very understanding and accommodating.
The downsides we experienced were that it was a little dusty and some kitchen surfaces didn't seem like they had been cleaned. The bathroom doesn't offer much privacy, which is understandable for a small cabin, but still something to keep in mind if you're anxious about that sort of thing like I am LOL. Also, while the covered windows provided the best experience for video games and movies on the projector, it also meant the cabin was a bit darker throughout the day. There wasn't an easy option for letting more light in, and I really wish there had been since the days were sunny and it would have been nice to enjoy the view without always needing to step outside.
Ultimately, though, a wonderful place and location for a short stay! I'm glad we chose it. :o)"

Stayed a few nights",Perfect little place to escape and have some time alone for our mini moon. We scheduled last minute and everything was ready. They had fire wood for us and all sorts of extra essentials which were greatly appreciated. We also took the quick drive to Columbus for a few more things to do. So if you need more its close enough for that too. I would recommend 110%

Stayed with a pet","Aaron and Kailee’s barn cabin was beautifully themed and crafted with all the modern day essentials one could ever dream of! Coming from busy city living, it was fairly easy to settle in and enjoy this lovely home-away-from-home.
During the day, my boyfriend and I enjoyed cooking in the full-size kitchen, watching tv on the projector, and cow watching from the front porch.
At night, we enjoyed spending time outside cozying it up by the bonfire while star-gazing the night away.
Aaron and Kailee generously provide everything needed for a rainy day game night, or a cozy night out by the fire.
You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into every little detail. We appreciated it all so much!
Would definitely recommend and would love to come back again!"

The only downfall was when we arrived the owners dogs kept growling and running towards our vehicles to the point where we had to completely stop so the dogs wouldn’t accidentally get hurt, one of the owners eventually came outside and controlled the dogs. Still giving 5 stars because dogs will be dogs! (:"

Was just nice. Was great having a stocked kitchen. Other bnb’s didn’t have as much as Cindi did. I was able to make potato salad and my dad was able to make a southern breakfast. Maybe a few more pots and pans would have been nice. My dad loved the snacks and candy on the table. Thanks for everything!!! We will definitely stay again next time we visit our friends in Madison!

Inside, it is a beautifully appointed space with a living area, dining area, work area with desk, full kitchen, separate bedroom, bath, and even an super secure double entryway with a stackable washer/dryer. It provides all the comforts of home, was spotless, and was tastefully decorated. Cindy was easy to work with and was kind enough to come and fix the TV when there was an issue. Madison is a charming rural area with a Dollar General a short distance from the rental and Moberly is an easy 10 minute drive. There were more than ample snacks provided and nothing was missed in terms of creature comforts. The value of this rental can not be beat! I’d book it again if I was staying in the area. What a gem!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is basically the definition of a ""hidden gem."" The unit is super clean, super comfortable and all the little details are thought out. Snacks (both salty and sweet), all the utensils and pans you need to cook, satellite tv, a basket of miscellaneous lotions and shampoos. At this reasonable price, you won't find a nicer AirBNB. It is a surprise find a place this nice in such a small town, but we can't wait to return and will probably make this one of our regular stops. Cindy was very flexible, responsive and answered questions quickly. Everything feels clean and new and the apartment is very stylish. And to top it off, Cindy does not charge a bunch of extra fees on top of the daily rate. For the money, this may be the best AirBNB I have stayed in so far. Thanks Cindy!"

Wish we could have stayed another day because I didn't really look at points of interest until the night before we left. It is also close to a bigger town with more choices of places to eat and shop. We can't wait to go back. I'd give it 10 out of 10."

Group trip","We had a wonderful long weekend at the cabin! It was a great place for our family of 6 to get away from the hustle and bustle of Homecoming weekend at Mizzou. We stayed unplugged and just enjoyed the scenery, pool table, fire pit and canoe. The cabin was comfortable, and everything we needed. It was a weekend full of wonderful memories and time together.
Mallory was fabulous. She responded quickly each time I sent her a message and helped us navigate a few things which were all resolved easily.
We did have an issue with spiders but once Mallory was informed she said she would get that taken care of right away. Those kinds of things are sort of expected out in the middle of nowhere, but with kiddos who are terrified, it was rough. Other than those issues, this place was a gem and I’m sure once the pest control is handled, it will be even better!"

Couldn't have been happier with the accommodations at this beautiful location with the scenic lake as your front yard! From fires on the patio, catching and releasing some good sized bass from the lake, playing a few games of pool or darts, firing up the grill for dinner, or sitting on the deck in the morning watching the birds (bald eagle!!), this place really has it all. Not to far from Mizzou...we'll definitely be back!!"

We wanted laid back and peaceful with lots of outdoor time, and that is what we got! The lake was beautiful…perfect for the canoe and kayak! We set a canopy on the deck and were able enjoy many, many hours outside in the sun or the shade! The charming cabin was well-stocked, comfortable and so clean!!!!
I have nothing but praise and rave reviews for the property and the host!
Mallory responded quickly to my questions and was wonderfully pleasant to work with!
I am extremely happy with our lovely experience and highly recommend Mallory’s place to anyone considering renting this Airbnb. It is a true gem!!!!

We've stayed at a few cabins in Missouri and Iowa and this is the clear winner so far. Mallory was in touch and very helpful while giving us our space to relax and take a much-needed break. We drove into Columbia and hit up a rails-to-trail hike and grabbed some Andy's frozen yogurt. It was terrific."

Stayed a few nights","This cabin on a private lake is perfect in every way. This level of natural beauty and privacy is rare to find at most AirBnbs in rural Missouri (I’ve stayed at quite a few).
Its quiet seclusion means you only hear bird calls with your morning coffee and a symphony of frogs accompanies evening star gazing. I was shocked by how FEW bug bites I got compared with how much time I spent outside - yes, there were bugs, but unlike my place in the city, the bugs didn’t swarm and ruin the outside. The exterior spaces are well thought out and furnished for relaxation, even the few trees sloping down to the lake are perfectly spaced to hang your hammocks for lazy afternoon naps. We loved the porch swing facing the bird feeder and marveled at the frequent hummingbird visitors.
This is an old, rustic cabin but the total interior renovation ensures just about every amenity you need while preserving the rough-hewn log look. There was plenty of space for the two of us to spread out on the tasteful furniture and enjoy postcard views from the large picture windows. The photos don’t do justice to just how lovely this space feels in person. We used the pool table and dart board quite a bit, those were an unexpected bonus.
The beds were super comfortable and good window shades kept the morning light away! The kitchen is well equipped - some of the sharpest knives of any rental - and had what we needed to prepare most of our meals from scratch.
We lucked out and found a slice of heaven in mid-Missouri. I NEVER book un-reviewed AirBnbs, but a last minute scramble to reserve some peace and quiet for the weekend overcame my usual caution. I’ve stayed in A LOT of rentals and this is one of the very best. We plan to return when the leaves begin to change colors.
The owners were excellent in all communication and the caretakers we had occasion to meet, Rob and Sue, were absolutely delightful and gave us lots of tips about the surrounding nature."

Stayed a few nights","After getting used to it, it was a comfortable place to stay. The art in the bathroom (heart spurting blood) may not be the best choice, especially for solo female travelers. It can be unnerving, especially with the rhythmic booming of the RV water pump, black duct tape on the walls, blackout curtains on BOTH sides of the bedroom windows, and lightbulbs hanging from ropes. After I got used to it, I enjoyed my stay. Mary was attentive, friendly and engaged."

Stayed a few nights","I spent the most relaxing 5 nights at the Summa Hotel that I have ever had in my adult life. The atmosphere is welcoming, cozy, and uplifting. This location was exactly as described and exactly what I was looking for when trying to escape my chaotic and busy life. As a wife, mother of 5 children (2 still at home) and 2 cats, 1 dog, 1 hamster, and 1 turtle- I never get alone time. The couch was so comfortable that I spent an entire evening just relaxing and watching DVD's on my laptop. The sky color in the evening through the two large windows was hypnotic. My husband popped in to spend one of the nights with me and the teddy bear of a pup was his new best friend- I think he spent a good hour petting the doggo and the tiny farm kitty. I could spend another week there in a heartbeat. The outdoor symphony was incredible to fall asleep to each night. Loved all of the kids homemade artwork around the house and the guidebook was awesome!"

Stayed a few nights","Love love loved this place! Exactly as described, this place was a little cabin in the woods that I would go back to again and again. The inside was cool, rustic, barnyard explosion with the best taste of quirky homey decor. It was also clean and the temp was easily manageable with the A/C and fan available. The fire pit was awesome and their kitty and big big pupper were awesome additions, they were super nice and loved people and getting pet, and they were adorable. Definitely a selling point for me!
We were also just a stones throw from moberly (15 minute drive) so we did the drive in, some mom and pop restaurants, and coffee shops, shopping, and frozen custard). Definitely not an isolating trip if you don’t want it to be, but can also feel very isolated if that’s what you want(best of both worlds)! The hosts were super responsive and kind and answered whatever questions we had. 10/10"

I wish the host had provided matches as we do not smoke so we couldn't light a match after using the restroom on the composting toilet as recommended. (So bring your own matches). I would also recommend guests bring materials to start a fire. There is a lovely fire pit, but you need to bring your own supplies. We loved meeting the great big doggie, Salvador. He was super friendly and wanted to hang out with us. For the very affordable rate, this place is a great value! We enjoyed our visit."

The building gets lots of lovely natural light and I found it to be clean and homey. Mary was very responsive and checked in on me when I arrived later than planned.
It is obvious that the rural hotel was built with care and that shows in all of the personal touches, from the light fixtures to the art on the walls! I felt very welcome, safe, and will definitely be visiting again."

Stayed a few nights","Rustic and quirky little cabin in the woods off the beaten path. I enjoyed reading books, cooking brats over the fire pit, snuggling up to the indoor electric fireplace with a cup of tea, seeing the horses next door, watching deer pass through the field during sunrise, walking through that open field, and spending some cuddle time with their pup and kitty.
I was really curious about the compost toilet since I’ve researched one for myself. Not gunna lie, I’m not a fan. But I think that had more to do with the small space it was in…so my legs were crammed and touching the wall and the sawdust bin no matter what.
Overall it was a sweet little setup. Thankful for my time here."

Stayed a few nights","I paid for 5 days. I was refunded for 4 days. I paid $67.25 for 1 day.
My son and his wife had told me: It was a beautiful rustic country environment. He loved waking up to turkeys in the field. The house had cute decorating.
His only complaints were no water for showers, toilet bucket wasn't emptied and cleaned, the place smelled like an outhouse, there was dried snot stuck on the comforter, what appeared to be smeared blood stains on the sheets, etc, and the whole place was filthy.
They did not see the dirty bedclothes until AFTER her husband left that night. I told them to take photos. They did.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri, Sept 16, 2022
That morning:
-6:37 AM- Mary assured me that there would be hot showers and clean linen for my son and his wife. I told Mary my son is doing extensive plumbing rehab for me. It is filthy work.
That evening:
-5:00 PM- My daughter-in-law stopped by the unit. The toilet bucket was half filled, and still had uncovered feces from last guest. Odor from that was in the room. Also, the soiled linens had been left outside on the chair by the front door.
-5:14 PM- I messaged Mary to empty toilet bucket, remove soiled linens.
-6:39 PM- Mary said she wasn't home, but she'd tell her husband. He had forgotten them when he did the room.
-6:50 PM- I messaged Mary- They are on their way now. Should be there in about 15 minutes. My son's been working on my plumbing all day and he REALLY needs a good shower.
-6:58 PM- Mary said husband was at soccer practice, and she was not home, but he would come when he was able.
-7:15 PM, approximately- My son and his wife arrived, after working in sewage all day. NOTHING had been done. 13 hours AFTER Mary had assured me very early that morning that there would be hot showers and clean bedding for my son and his wife.
Early Sat, Sept 16, 2022-
My daughter-in-law texted me at 1:52 AM. She said Mary's husband came by, removed forgotten soiled linens. He said water tank was empty. He would fill it tomorrow. My daughter-in-law told me the place was filthy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After check out, over the next 3 days, I argued with Mary about why the water tank wasn't filled (it wasn't her fault), we were wrong to take the stance we had (her listing, so her responsibility), why we should pay $102.08 for 1 night's stay in that ""atmosphere"" and not the $67.25 that her listing said, etc. etc.
Mon, Sep 19, 2022
8:18 PM- Mary said, ""Your refund has been issued Donna. Do we have an agreement with what I proposed? Because at this point I did not get paid the full amount (again I only got paid $3.00) for the night they did choose to stay. I am willing to let it rest if there is no bad reviews left on my listing. If not, I will make a new request to get the money for the one night. If you refuse my request Airbnb will need to get involved with the dispute.""
Then I stopped being polite. Here's part of what I said:
You KNEW a hot shower and clean linen was what I AM PAYING FOR and expecting. You assured me that would be no problem.
You KNEW John was working on my plumbing all day and needed water for showering.
You KNEW that toilet bucket needed emptying and cleaning before John and Bobbie arrived.
Mary said: ""You are right those things needed to be done and then they were all completed once we were aware that they had not been done when they needed to be""
WRONG. They were completed the next day. Again, we did not received the contracted services you expect me to pay for.
Mary- ""Your son agreed that would be fine and then did not keep his end of the agreement.""
WRONG! My son went to sleep FILTHY after working on my plumbing all day. He accepted what your husband offered because he had no choice! It was too late to find accommodations elsewhere.
Mary said- ""The deal I am striking here is that I am willing to not get paid any more then $3.00 if you do not leave a bad review. If I get paid and get a bad review, I will keep pushing for a different level of refund. One that gives you less money so I can get paid a fair rate.""
I said- It's Air BnB that's paying you only $3.00! NOT ME!
I am paying $67.25 for no shower, dirty linens, excrement odor from a toilet bucket not emptied and cleaned before arrival, etc. Imagine working on plumbing all day and having to breathe THAT odor all night. AND PAY for the experience. AND FIGHT with the host to receive it!
And now, all I have to do to receive my 4 day refund in full, after this prolonged, tiresome, upsetting, UNPROFESSIONAL argument, is agree to leaving a FALSE REVIEW!
So my integrity is expected to be sacrificed so you can get three lousy bucks.
Mary- ""If we leave it at this you will have proved my original point.
""Guests wanting something for nothing. There are people who travel around and complain about everything they can find to complain about and then they get a free stay.
""I also have the power to leave bad reviews for my guests as well.""
Me again- How is my paying $67.25 for 1 day wanting something for nothing?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On top of all this, Air BnB over-refunded ME $21.19. I told Support that was MARY'S money. She had refunded me IN FULL for 4 unused days. She SHOULD make more than $3.00 for our stay. It's only right.
My advice: Read all negative reviews, notice the Host's replies and reasoning. Do they accept responsibility, or is it frequently ""guests wanting"

Stayed a few nights","This place was exactly what I needed for a few days. Loved the little touches that Mary has done and takes me back to my family farm where you used what you had to make do. Things aren't dirty, they are loved and brought back to life (they don't make refrigerators like that anymore!) Bring a good book, tea or coffee, and firewood and enjoy the simple life. And don't be intimidated by the toilet. You go, you cover it, done.
Enjoyed the evening visits from the pup and the singing birds in the morning. Yes, you'll hear things. Was it a mouse? A barn cat? Jason Voorhees!? 😉 Who knows. But what I do know is you're safe, you're in the country and bumps in the night happen. Take it all in!
Thanks again the wonderful stay, Mary! Will be back as soon as I can. 🙂"

It was very clean and had numerous home supplies if you forgot bring on your trip. My only complaint was the commode it is a porta body style toilet with no running water but if you use their sawdust store next to it and the incense that I finally noticed in the bathroom as well then it makes it much more pleasant of a stay. I will stay there again!"

Stayed one night","We had a one night stay at Mary’s, and while it was quite enjoyable, there are a few reasons we’d likely not return.
It’s a compost toilet, which is totally fine, but there was no toilet paper on the holder, under any cabinets, or anywhere. Thankfully we’d brought tissues so we used those. Dishes weren’t really clean (sticky spots and dead bugs in them), and the rest of the place wasn’t really either.
The location was nice, directions were accurate, check-in was easy, there was plenty of water, and the bed was comfortable.
We expected a bit of a “glamping” experience, as the listing said it would be rustic, so much of that was fine (we made lots of cute spider friends), but overall it didn’t feel like guests were expected."

Stayed one night","This was my favorite bnb ever and I've stayed in quite a few spots. Host was communicative, directions were clear, the spot is so private, the lights were on when I arrived, and there was a pleasant essential oil diffuser going that made everything smell lovely. You look out onto the most verdant field of fireflies at dusk with deer and rabbits running around. The dog is SUPER friendly and adorable. I loved every second.
The people who wrote long paragraphs trashing this families spot are lunatics or didn't read the description. It's a literal BARN, people. It's a super deal, there are campsites with zero amenities on Airbnb that cost more than this. There is hardly any cell service, the fridge is ancient ( but so cold) , a little dust and there are bugs outside unless you leave the door open then they will come inside. I had to drive through a wall of butterflies and dragonflies when I left so don't know what the person who wanted to experience more nature was talking about. The water pump makes a healthy sounds that reminds you to conserve it. NoTV only a stereo with radio and records. These are all things that enhanced the off grid experience. And there were no mice or signs of them.
I so appreciate spots like this and hope this family continues to host on this site regardless of the occasional confused person."

Stayed a few nights","We did not arrive until late but Mary had the lights on for us. Wished there was somekind of outdoor lighting. I would like to say it would have been nice for a bit more mowing and trimming around the barn area as well. We drive a truck and it was a bit difficult to get in and out both out of the truck and for the truck to get turned around. I think it could have been a bit difficult if the ground was wet.
The windows would be wonderful assets if we could have been able to see out of them better. I know windows get dirty quickly in the country but I would have liked to see more of the nature outside. We did not get to see the dog and only a glimpse of the cute kitty. I am sure it would be a great place for deer but only seen a glimpse of one running thru the corner of the pasture.
The bed was very comfortable. AC worked great. The fridge was nice but weird to see someone else's food in there. If it was left for us to use it might have been good to have a note about that. Wish we had access to use the freezer but it was full of frost / ice but the fridge did good keeping things cold. The incense were really strong and had to be put away.
This was our first time using a composting toilet. It was definitely a different experience, we can say we used one but not probably something we want to do again.
They did describe how it is there and it is definitely not the cleanest spot but it is a place in a barn. I didn't feel comfortable using the cooking / utensils so we just ate out instead. Which fyi, The Brick restaurant in Moberly serves a decent breakfast and pretty cheap.
It is very very quiet there and was nice to ""unplug"" ourselves from our phones.
Rothwell park in nearby Moberly is super cute as well for something to do.
Overall it was a different experience, got some good rest, stayed nice and cool, host seemed nice and good communication but probably not some where we will stay again."

I drove 15 hours from my last Airbnb and showed up to neglected cleaning, tons of bugs, smell of poop lingering throughout the place, and a few things here and there that I’d rather not bash the host on. Ultimately I decided I would rather sleep in my car and cancel my stay. This may be for some people but it was not for my family and I. I had some expectations of some things that aren’t perfect due to the listing. The host had good communication and I believe good intentions. However there is plenty of cleaning that needs to be addressed that isn’t just a routine thing, it’s been neglected for months, especially around the furniture and the bathroom smell."

Stayed one night","Hair on the sheets. Mouse nests in the walls and visibly in cracked ceilings. 7ft ceilings, spiders everywhere and spider webs everywhere some at face level very easily cleaned if they ever cared.
Dirtiest fridge Iv ever seen and Iv been a housekeeper for 8 years. Big smelly dog that tries to get in your car or the house. Dog hair everywhere. Nasty sink with dirty dishes still in there, disturbing pictures and art, MICE! Good luck fitting in the shower. Unusable, dirty, filled freezer.
They just don’t clean it blows my mind, they claim to be Christians. Cleanliness is next to godliness right?? Please don’t stay here. I hate leaving reviews like this but this place is the worst of the worst.
I live and built an off grid home and am comfortable with the compost toilets and rustic living, but when the toilet compost is dumped right in front of the house, it makes for an unsafe place for other animals and humans with the waste being so close to the home.
I’ve had low quality Airbnb experiences in other countries, but this is by far, the worst, dirtiest, and sadly the most expensive Airbnb experience that I’ve had, and it’s in the US!
This Airbnb was quite Frankly, half assed and uncomfortably so.
Upon leaving, our car got stuck in the mud, as there’s not much gravel for traction. The host was very kind to help us with this and we are thankful. I believe that they are good people, they may just be ignorant to the fact that their rental is not anywhere near acceptable for the price of this Airbnb in the United States of America & with additional effort, it could be brought to acceptable standards."

Stayed one night","when I arrived it was love at first site. I looked past the slight imperfections as I didn't go there to judge, I went there to get rest. That's just what I got. As for the ""bugs"" I didn't see any. Cobwebs/spiders were present but it's expected in secluded areas where there's dust and trees n Missouri's full of high winds. The webs didn't bother me as I love animals including spiders. If I used dishes which I did..wash it before using and after using. Didnt complain about a dirty dish. Did not see any mold anywhere. Home smelled great. Lots of fresh towels and washcloths clean bedding. Home was neat n tidy. Now here's my favorite part of my whole first bnb experience...the huge WILD dogs as one guest puts it. There was a white Great Pireneese... Beautiful puppy. Friendly baby. Made me feel safe and kept me company as I stayed there alone. That puppy has a name. It's Salvadore. If you don't like dogs then this isn't the the place for you. The dogs own the property too and was trained to secure the perimeter and make sure people are safe. Atleast that's how I see it. Salvadore and his St Bernard brother are always welcome to come down anytime I'm there. Mary was a great host. Therefore I've decided to dedicate 1 day a week to make The Rural Hotel my Relief spot. See you next week"

The place is a perfect size for an intimate get away. It was so cozy with all the snow all around. The most beautiful dog I've ever seen came to say goodnight to us. We were only there a few hours, but it was a great ending to our night."

Mary was super easy to communicate with and was very welcoming. The toilet was very unique. My only problem was that the cell service was very spotty.

Stayed one night","We were very excited to find this Airbnb, as it seemed to be just what we were looking for. We loaded up our van and drove to the location. When we got there (2.5 hours past check in time) we were astonished to find the last guests mess still there. Dirty dishes on the counter, wet towels on the floor, a full trash can, an unmade bed, and their note to the host sitting on the table! We couldn’t believe it. Needless to say, we didn’t stay. We had to turn around and drive another 45 mins home. We did not hear anything from Mary until almost 6pm, at which point, she messaged saying she had just gotten there to check on the place, and she wondered if we’d decided not to come. We were so disappointed to have spent all that time and money to get there, only to have to leave and make new plans. And that is what we told Mary. I asked her for a full refund, which she returned most of. Her message back to us made us feel like we were to blame for everything, when we did nothing wrong.
I never want to leave a bad review for someone, but this was an extreme situation for us to be put in. I feel there could be an improvement with communication, as well as, with keeping up on the cleaning between guests. It’s not unreasonable to be upset to arrive to an Airbnb you paid money for, only find another guests mess, especially 2.5 hours after check in."

Antique fridge was interesting as well. Getting to the cabin itself is pretty remote. I would not suggest it with ice or snow or even heavy rain, unless your vehicle has 4 wheel drive and/or sits up from the ground. My van did not like it...lol. I would not would I recommend it for a single middle aged gal alone (unless you are like a pal of mine the survivor type.) It was too remote for that...however, for a couple or single guy, it works and the price was right. Everything outside was dusty and there are tall weeds...it is a farm after all. The toilet? UM...not for me but it works. Expect spartan, not luxury. Host was quick to communicate and kind."

Stayed a few nights","Do not stay here. We have stayed in A LOT of airbnb's around the world and I have NEVER been to one as unclean as this one. There is a difference between rustic and dirty. Firstly, the linens are stained and did not smell freshly washed. The towels had dead bugs in them and only one large towel was provided. The dishes were dirty and covered in cob webs as was every corner of the space. The composting toilet is the LEAST of my concerns and was cleaner than most of the space. We tried to go walking on the gravel road only to be accosted by two large WILD dogs who would not leave us alone and scared our 2 year old. The kitchen supplies are sparse but not the worst. There are not paper towels or again clean things to use to wash dishes or dry your hands. The AC did work well and kept the whole space cool."

Admittedly, the disconnect from the internet and limited activity was just about the perfect time. The biggest challenge was getting a gauge for water usage, as the running water relies on a limited tank. After a couple of days, I felt I didn't need to worry about it much, but if you're the type to take extra long showers, you'll probably need to reel that in."

Stayed with kids","Cute little space with everything you need to relax, do some reading and cook meals. We loved the visiting dogs and the lighting in the space was just so very cool. We did a lot of coloring and my granddaughter and I gave each other sparkle tattoos. Probably my favorite was the turntable. I haven’t use my turntable in over 30 years and I forgot how much I enjoyed vinyl records. I brought some of my own vinyl along and my granddaughter and I sang and danced to Chrissy Hynne and the Pretenders.
We went down to the creek and even though it was a way down my six-year-old granddaughter wanted to try it. We climb down marveled at how sexy ice was on the little creek and then while we were climbing out Annabel told me that she felt like she was climbing a mountain. That is what she has told everybody since about the trip. That we climbed a mountain together. Thanks so much"

I arrived after a long drive and was first a bit anxious by the lack of connection, but after turning on the thoughtfully placed lights and listening to the only downloaded Spotify playlist I had, I had the BEST evening. The space is decorated with art that inspires you to pick up one of their colored markers and get to creating! Make sure you turn on all the lights at night for the best vibes. Though I don't live anywhere near here, I would make an effort for a return trip."

Stayed a few nights",I can’t tell you what to expect because everyone has a different perspective and background. But what I experienced was life changing. I hadn’t really been without service for four days. And you can get service by just going 20 feet to the road. But having to go that extra step for service made me realize I needed balance in how much I use my phone. So now I keep it on airplane mode till afternoon. The country barn eclectic artsy woods style was my jam man. I was enthralled with how they did things. I want one of my own and I’ve tried to incorporate elements in my own home. So many sweet sweet touches. Back to the basics. The privacy of the back yard was life changing. Didn’t really realize how much that induces peace. I cried the night before I left bc I was gonna miss it so much. Met Mary and Chad and the chickens and cats and dogs. What wonderful members of the community. Can’t say enough wonderful things.

Stayed a few nights","This place is definitely off the grid a little bit (in a good way!) I had no issues finding the place with the help of GPS and the hotel signs they put up. It is on a gravel road off of a highway, but once you're there you can only hear cars that drive right by you on the gravel road. The parking space is very small which was fine for my small car, but I would be cautious if I had a the combination of a larger vehicle and terrible reverse skills. The hotel itself was very clean! It did have a unique smell on the main room, but I got used to it after five minutes or so. The bed was the comfiest thing I have ever slept on!!! As a 21-one-year old woman traveling by herself rather far away, I studied the reciews of this place like crazy to make sure I would be safe (which I was!) I did notice that one of the reviews stated that there wasn't a top sheet on the bed. That has apparently changed as there was one when I stayed there. The air conditioning worked well and the place was a comfortable temperature. I had a fire both nights I was there and even cooked my own food over the fire on the first night. I saved the leftovers in the fridge and used their kitchen tools to reheat it the second night. My absolute favorite thing about this place was the record player!!! They had a hand full of records, but I mainly played the classical and jazz records. It was bice to listen to amazing records that had more popular pieces in these genres instead of the typical random pieces that you find in most record stores. I had zero service inside the barn and the close surrounding area, but as soon as I got a little farther up the gravel road in my car my phone was dinging insanely with notifications. So if you're really desperate for service you can find some with a two minute walk up the road. Since there was no service I would recommend planning what you are going to do for the day before you get there if you plan on leaving for a while. One of my surprise mini-trips was over to the Walt Disney Hometown Museum and Family Farm. I'm a huge disney fan and had no clue this existed until I searched ""attractions"" in google maps. It was about an hour drive from the place... This was my first time staying in an Airbnb and traveling by myself hours away from home. I spontaneously booked this place 4 days before I arrived, and I couldn't have picked a better place to go!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","If you're in the area and want to get away from it all, go here. It's definitely funky,in a good way.
Starters, it has a composting toilet, which I didn't need, no wifi or cell signal and no TV. Not for everyone, but if you want some peace and quiet you'll get it here.
It might not be for everyone, but I'd certainly go back. Missouri is gorgeous in the summer in the country and this little place us smack in the middle of it. Out the front of the ""barn"" is a hayfield. Last night there, I just sat outside and looked at stars and lighting bugs- a gazillion lighting bugs, and no street lights, barn lights anywhere. Itself worth the price of admission.
Plenty of hot water for me and AC was fine.
About a half hour from finger Lake State Park.
Like I say, if you like funky and want solitude, this be the place.
Mary is super nice and very easy to deal with. Look forward to goung back.

Do yourself a favor and camp here because the best part of the experience is that you're surrounded by beautiful trees and greenery! they were kind enough to let me use the space and also set up a little tent out in the field in front of the hotel since I told them I sleep really well out in nature and it's very healing for me :) my only wish is that I had more time to bribe the cat with treats that was a little bit skittish so she would come and say hi :)

Stayed one night","To start, communication with Mary was top notch. She responds very quickly and is very thoughtful and friendly.
The surrounding area is so pretty and quiet. Very safe area. My suggestion would be to not arrive after dark. My husband and I drove 13 hours in one day and with inevitable delays along the way, we arrived here after dark. (Also, like the knuckle heads we are, we were listening to spooky mystery cases all evening.) Consequently, we were already a little freaked out when we showed up, in the dark, down a bumpy road, and to top it off we were very tired. It’s also rather difficult to find in the dark. We ended up finding the place after he accidentally passed it, and like any good, stubborn husband, he wouldn’t put the Jeep in reverse to go back, so we had to turn around in a tiny driveway right down the road.
I had completely forgotten to explain the place to him. Needless to say, it wasn’t what he was expecting. When he saw the toilet, he just looked at me... but considering he has willingly spent countless nights in the woods with no porcelain throne to rest his derrière, he had no room to complain. The toilet was different but was no issue. As expected, it did make the place smell a bit like wood shavings, which I actually like. Needless to say, explain where you’re going to your partner BEFORE you get there. Don’t do like I did and just shock them. As a result, he was a little uneasy.
After settling into bed, we heard a noise (which ended up just being the cat outside) and my husband got even more spooked and went to check it out.
But y’all, even after all this, the bed was soooo soft that we slept like babies. I don’t remember waking up once!! It was a really great and much needed sleep.
When we woke up in the morning, we saw that we were in pretty woods and there was a nice field nearby. It’s in a very nice little spot. There’s even a fire pit and chairs. I didn’t look in the fridge or the shower, but the rest of the place was very clean.
Suggestions: try to arrive during the day, make sure you’re driving a vehicle that can handle a bumpy road, keep an open mind and realize this isn’t a $100 hotel room. It’s in the country so there are bugs that wander in, a weird shavings toilet that works just fine, and a bed is on the floor but incredibly soft and comfy. Also, expect a long but beautiful drive off the highway to get here.
If you like quiet and are just fine with these other things, this is the place for you!"

The space was cute and functional with a stylish artistic touch. Everything you might need was provided, very thoughtful. The meadow was beautiful and great for daily nature walks. I didn't get much cellphone service, but that's to be expected in a rural area. When I had car trouble she suggested local businesses to help. Overall it was a very rejuvenating two weeks and I will definitely request to stay again next time I am in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely beautiful setting! This was possibly the most relaxing getaway I’ve ever enjoyed….. and I was working every day!! The quiet lakefront home is surrounded by trees and it felt like I was tucked into a little slice of nature. Every opportunity I had to slip away from my laptop was spent on the dock, soaking it all in. The home was exceptionally clean and spacious. Abundant supplies on hand. It seems nothing was overlooked to make sure guests have everything they might need. Excellent wifi, so no issues staying connected to work.
Callie was great! She checked in right away to make sure my arrival was smooth, plus again later asking if I had any needs that they could help with.
Wish I had stayed longer. I will definitely return to see the fall colors changing. Very impressed! Book it!!! You will not be disappointed!"

Stayed over a week","This location is on a working farm. While the host's home sits up near the road, the BnB is a good distance back from the road. The farm has a trio of cats that can be a lot fun to watch. They also have a small flock of very colorful, free-range chickens lead around during the day by a particularly handsome rooster. Last, but hardly least, the farm has about 50 head of cattle on it. On a clear night, it is easy to get ""out of reach of the barnyard lights"" and see oodles of stars!
The BnB itself, was clean and new. As the images indicate, it's a large rectangular space, with a bathroom ""carved out"" of the northeast corner. It's perfect for a couple wanting to get away for a weekend, or more. (We were there for 3 weeks, ""hiding"" from the dust and fuss of a significant remodel effort taking place in our home!)
Check out Finger Lakes State Park, just a few miles south of the BnB, as you head to Columbia. There are quaint local eateries, plus lot's of choices in Columbia."

To begin, the whole place is beautifully decorated. You immediately feel at peace when you come into this cozy home. Everything is so well organized, with signs and baskets and binders with all necessities and explanations of amenities. Maria went above and beyond in providing everything a weary traveller might want- a kitchen stocked with pots and pans, an adorable coffee/tea/hot cocoa bar, toiletries, books and games. My children normally have a hard time staying at new places, but they settled right in here. We were sad to leave, and will definitely be booking here for our cross country trips in the future. Love this spot, definitely would recommend to anyone who is on the road and looking for a little taste of home."

Stayed a few nights","This downstairs apartment was very clean and spacious. It felt like home. The kitchen was stocked extremely well. Lori even provided milk, bread, butter and eggs. Outstanding. The bathrooms are also well stocked with everything you need. The furniture is very clean and comfortable as well. The only negatives would be that the wifi signal is weak and the which didn't allow me to use Prime or Amazon to watch TV. In speaking with Lori she will be working on providing a stronger connection in the near future. You couldn't ask for a better host in my opinion."

Stayed a few nights","Lori's place is very comfortable and welcoming. From the moment we walked in we could see this was not a typical Air B&B! The home is so well decorated and certainly the best stocked of any other place we've stayed. The property is in the country and feel like you're in the woods. The setting is amazing in the fall! We didn't have a chance to take advantage of the outdoor offerings this time (hiking, fire pit, grill, hammock), but hope to in the future. We were there for Mizzou homecoming so having a quiet place to return to at night was delightful! Lori is a responsive and accommodating host with a welcoming personality, but also one who doesn't hover. This is our third Air B&B in the Como area and by far the best!"

She even went the extra mile and had the fridge and pantry stocked with essentials. It was stocked with everything we could want and more!
This space would be best for couples or small families as you are sharing the basements so wouldn’t be good if you are planning on being too loud. (But there are plenty of beds!) We will definitely be back the next time we have to come to town!"

Lori was a great hostess that went beyond our expectations. She was clear in communication and directions. She added so many personal touches like flowers in the pots outside the entry doors with many more. We loved it. I believe you will too.

If you are by yourself for a bit of R & R or taking the entire family with you there is something for everyone here. Lori is a great host communicating well our needs and expectations. I would highly recommend staying at her place. The kitchen is very well stocked, she provided breakfast foods and all amenities needed to make them which were greatly appreciated as it is a bit of a jaunt to a restaurant in the morning."

Stayed a few nights","Oh, my gosh! Where do I begin? From the moment I booked, Lori's communication was excellent. She was thorough, quick and friendly. This was my first AirBNB and I knew exactly what to expect. The space was much larger than I anticipated and very welcoming. For us, what really made us think she went above and beyond were the ""little touches"". She left home-made cookies for us the first day, everything was organized and neatly labeled, there were complimentary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash) and she also provided lots of snacks and breakfast items. It really was a home away from home. It was far enough from the city to enjoy the peace and quiet, but also not too far away that it was extremely inconvenient.
If I could put (10) stars I would! Thanks so much, Lori!!"

Stayed with kids","The location, space and cost were great for us while we were needing to be back and forth to University Hospital for several days.
Cons to staying here is that you cannot control the temperature of your stay and opening windows allows nature to come inside quite heavily. We were told that they had wifi, but it would only work well for 2 devices for regular use, not gaming. Which that wasn't an issue because our toddlers would only be watching cartoons, but the issue came in when we were threatened with being charged $15 a gig because we were using to much internet. She claimed she told this, but there is nothing in her listing or previous conversation about usage, just quality of internet.
Pros are that the semi privacy is nice. The large yard was great for our toddlers to play in and explore, instead of being stuck inside. The grill was a fun bonus for my husband to use too!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at the Woodland Fox Retreat is like staying at your best friend's house. No detail has been overlooked; the space is spotless and well-appointed with games, books, movies, and food. The towels are thirsty and abundant, the bedding is luxurious, the memory foam mattress cradles you in slumber, and the assortment of toiletries leaves nothing to be desired. Lori was quick to respond to my questions, and she graciously allowed us to use her oven to heat up an impromptu Easter dinner--she even made us a batch of rolls from scratch! We enjoyed wandering over the trails on the property, and the frogs sang us to sleep at night. Lori made every effort to anticipate our every need, and we were amazed at how well-stocked the fridge and pantry were! Lori and Bill were friendly and present when we had questions, and they left the place to us while we had Easter dinner. I've never had a better Airbnb experience, and we will happily stay at Woodland Fox Retreat when we return to the area."

It is just a curtain at the bottom of stairs and you can separate the living room from the top floor with a door that doesn’t lock. If you do this one bedroom is still right at the bottom of the stairs, now separated from the living quarters. With that said, we were never bothered by the hosts and they were extremely kind when we ordered food and it was delivered to their door. Also I think it is good to mention that we were visited by a cat that came from the top floor. We loved it and found joy from it, but if you are allergic, keep that in mind."
