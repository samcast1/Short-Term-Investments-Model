Stayed with a pet","I recently stayed at this lovely Airbnb and had a fantastic experience. The house was clean, cozy, and very peaceful, making it the perfect getaway. My son absolutely loved the pull-out couch and found it very comfortable. Our dog enjoyed the great yard, which was a perfect space for her to play. We also really enjoyed spending time on the porches, soaking in the serene atmosphere. Highly recommend this place for a relaxing stay!"

Stayed one night",Dean’s cozy cottage was the perfect place to stay after viewing the eclipse! It was very welcoming and inviting! We had a great conversation with our host about the history of the cabin and things to do in the area! We would give it 10 stars if that was possible! We will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!

Stayed one night","We enjoyed our time in the cabin very much. One night was not enough to use all of the amenities. The cabin felt very welcoming, homey ,and had a nice atmosphere. Some properties are bare bones inside, but this had very nice decor, linens, books, and even a record player with a selection of records. The variety of kitchen and bath supplies was impressive and appreciated. We would have enjoyed the fire pit and back porch if we had time. It’s too bad we didn’t get a chance to meet the hosts as they seemed nice and generous based on our messaging interactions. We are strongly considering a trip back there when the weather is warmer."

Stayed over a week","My husband booked Dean's as he was working an outtage at United Refinery. He typically stays in a motel, but since the job was at least 2 weeks, he found Dean's Cozy Cottage. He was very comfortable there and had everything he needed to shower ad make meals. Dean is local and stopped by a couple times. He really liked how neat and tidy everything was and the high quality blankets on the bed. He was able to extend his stay easily which saved him from moving half way through a job. He also loved the peaceful setting. He would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","This little cottage is fabulous. We needed a place close to Warren that we could bring our pet with us, Dean and Ashley accommodated us without hesitation. They were very prompt with a response to messages. The cottage was so cute and cozy, I loved the decor. It has two sitting (living) rooms, I kind of took it as a ""His and Hers"". That was perfect. The cottage is sort of at the edge of town. It sits on the corner with a little grove of trees behind it, virtually no neighbors on those two sides, perfect for the dog aspect. The place was stocked with any utensil or dish you need to prepare and serve a meal. Keurig for morning coffee, very convenient. This cottage is only about 20 min. from Wolf Run Marina/Docksiders Restaurant and Kinzua reservoir. Planning on booking another stay in the spring to ready our boat for the summer. This place is a definite 5 STAR rating!"

Stayed with kids","The home is conveniently located with a lovely yard space. Although advertised as family friendly and suitable for young children, I would argue it’s not suitable for kids under 2, decorations and toys throughout the home are choking hazards and made for a stressful stay.
As for the specifics of our stay, we were very disappointed in the hosts response to the emergency that occurred. On the 2nd night of our 7 night stay, a pipe burst in the bathroom at 1:30am flooding the bathroom and hallway. We reacted immediately, getting the water shut off, floors soaked up with towels and getting fans on the floor. The host did answer our call and arranged for a plumber the next day but it still required us to do multiple loads of laundry to prevent mold and mildew from growing, as well as spending hours cleaning up the home and constantly refreshing the airflow.
We requested a refund of our cleaning fee as compensation but was denied stating she wasn’t going to make a profit otherwise."

Stayed with kids","Cassandra’s house was bright and comfortable. The house has great energy. It is fully stocked with everything you need in her “home away from home”. There is so much lovely outdoor space to spread out. She provides lots of extras in case you have forgotten something and large soft bath linens are a bonus! The bed I slept in was very comfortable and linens were soft. Our little family cooked meals in the kitchen and even used the fire pit out back for making “mountain pies and pizzas”. You can chill out on the back porch or in lovely gardens wrapped around the house. The yard has lots of privacy but is very spacious. Zen is located just out of downtown with super easy access to every part of Warren and lovely surrounding adventure areas. The garage was great for storing our bikes and yard games during our stay. I can’t say enough good things about this place. It really made us comfortable in the middle of our 4000 mile road trip from AZ to “Back Home”, MY home, Warren, PA. It’s a gem!!!"

Stayed a few nights","I was in a pinch and needed a place last minute. Cassandra's place was perfect. I was concerned I wouldnt be reserved in time becasue it says owner has 24 hours to confirm. Cassandra was lightning fast and assured me no problems. Then followed up to make certain we were happy. This was my first time using AirBnB and Cassandra made it so easy. The place was immaculate and perfect for anyone looking to stay in the area. The neighborhood is peaceful and offers a perfect outdoor sitting area to enjoy with the family.
Thank you so much!
Highly recommend Cassandra and this location!"

Finally, Cassandra was quick to answer our questions anytime we needed to ask her something, good communication!"

Short walk to downtown and short driving distance to anything else in the area. When I check available dates, visiting Warren, I check Alexxis’ place first. I had a family emergency and needed to extend my stay. Alexxis was very prompt with my inquiry and opened the booking to accommodate my needs so I could stay a few extra days. Thanks again, Alexxis, everything was great and I look forward to staying there in the future.

I had no problems in the apartment my entire stay—everything was clean and as described. The best part of this apartment though is Alexxis is so responsive and understanding! She responded to all my messages quickly and was very flexible when I had some schedule changes. I would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area.

The view from the private back deck and yard is gorgeous and peaceful, and although it’s in a residential area, feels very private and was quiet. Alexxis is a great host and was very communicative! The place was very clean and we left feeling refreshed and relaxed!!!"

We needed to ask for some instructions upon checking out but Alexxis responded within mins to guide us on what to do. The apartment was super clean which was nice. The deck over looking the creek/river (not sure which body of water we were looking at) was awesome too. Full size kitchen appliances and washer and dryer was, especially if you were staying for a longer amount of time. Hoping to stay there again next year when we come through town."

Stayed a few nights","Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Eddy with Paul and Christine, they were very kind and helpful and I would recommend staying with them. I saw in another review of this property someone said ""what you see is what you get"" and this is accurate. While everything was clean (with the exception of a few greasy dishes and an old worn out sponge) the house could use a few upgrades. Outlets are very finicky and trying to charge a phone is nearly impossible, the sofa is broken and the beds are uncomfortable. Again the hosts, are incredibly kind but be aware that ""what you see is what you get"" here. If you're looking for a basic getaway this is your spot, if you want something a little more like home, this location isn't for you."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect for my wife and I and two college kids, the house was well stocked with appliances, kitchen items, and various condiments left from other renters. We lost water in one bathroom because it got to -6 a couple of nights and despite leaving the sink on a slight drip, the pipes froze but we kind of expected that. I guess it wasn’t enough water running, but that was through no fault of Paul and Christine. The house was warm and cozy and the hot air in the house was good enough probably to keep the water going in the bathroom in the center of the house and kitchen so we were fine. Was just a five minute drive to downtown Warren. Nice place, private despite being fairly close to the other houses on the property and the owners communicated quickly."

We saw some great stars and planets even being fairly close to Warren. Easy check-in and no 10-page exit procedure. Awesome lil getaway!"

Not only did he allow us to drop off a car there a little early so we can explore, but he allowed us to have a fire in the pit in the backyard. He was so helpful from day one to the last night. So kind to our dog and super clean home. I’ll be coming back if it’s available"

Stayed with a pet","The house was clean and well maintained (albeit lacking in sufficient utensils). But I was very disappointed in the location, as photos suggested that the river was clearly visible from the property. It was not. The promised babbling brook wasn't visible through the overgrowth. There is a lovely clearing by the river - but be prepared for a small (not particularly scenic) hike to get there.
It was fine for comfortable place to rest your head at night, but not what we had hoped in terms of a family getaway."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful place to stay! We stayed almost a week and loved it! Highly recommend. Only downside was, they should include more pics of the property so you can see that there are 2 other houses right next to the rental on the same driveway… pics do not show that at all. We were pretty annoyed when we pulled up and saw there were multiple houses on the property right on top of each other when the pics made it seem like it was alone. HOWEVER, the stay was amazing and you CAN NOT hear or see the neighbors at all unless you’re out front. Even then we didn’t hear or see anyone. Paul and Christine answer very quickly any time you need to message them. Sent someone to us 9am when we messaged asking if they had a battery for the smoke detector! Really appreciate how on top of things they are and we hope to come back to visit again! The place is great and it snowed while we were there so we had a lot of fun playing in the snow like children. The home is extremely comfortable, reminds me of a cabin, and we were able to bring both of our cats."

Stayed a few nights","This was my second Air BnB experience . The house was all one floor, and was very cute and cozy. The main room felt a little more like a cabin to me because of the wall paneling, but I really liked that about the place. The bedrooms had more of the cottage vibe, so I felt it was the best of both worlds. I had a little bit of a hard time getting in contact with the hosts on the way up, but they were in an area with no cell service, which is a reality of the Allegheny National Forest. I met Paul and he was friendly and easygoing. The first day I didn't go up because of severe storms the whole way up, and he offered to let me stay the following night as it just so happned to be free. I definitely appreciated that!
The house was located on the same road that drives down to the dam and the fish hatchery. I recommend taking a tour of the hatchery. It only takes a few minutes of your time to learn about the awesome work they do there."

While the property was conveniently located close to town and the other wonderful parts of Warren County, it was not the ""cottage in the woods"" suggested in the description. Multiple other houses in view, with noise coming continuously from two of them. The river was not visible from the home, though it was from the firepit at the end of the steep path.
The layout of the home was good with two bedrooms on one side and another on the other. It would really be nice to have a fully outfitted kitchen with a full set of adult sized utensils (only five forks available - some salad size, four knives etc ...), a full set of glasses, juice glasses, etc ...
Everyone was very nice, but I stay in many Airbnb properties, and this property did not match the description."

With all the fresh snow, it was beautiful. The house was a home, my adult children and I felt comfortable and relaxed being there. Paul shoveled while we were out and made it safe for us coming back from our outing. Due to the reason of us being up there, we didn't get time to enjoy to much but Paul was kind with his condolences. My daughter said as we were leaving, ""We need to save this one to the favorites, so when we have time, we can stay again"""

A secluded spot that feels homey, cozy, and is full of all the things you probably neglected to pack from ground cinnamon to giant checkers. My stay was during a very strong snowstorm, and I couldn’t have been in a better spot to watch the large flakes trickle down, dusting the treetops and covering the ground. My dog and I enjoyed the views, hiked in a nearby trail in Allegheny National Forest, and felt very at peace at The Eddy. Thanks for the awesome trip."

Stayed with kids","Great Quiet Cottage to spend a hunkered Down Thanksgiving. My Wife, Two Teenage Boys and two small dogs had a great time hitting local hiking and checking out the Kinzua Dam. Close Enough to Town for a quick jaunt to pick up dinner but far enough out to feel like your in the woods. There is real value in this clean cozy cottage for the price with all the ""free"" nature activities nearby. The area down to the Allegheny river looked to be not maintained and I didn't see the firepit on the river. (We never asked and it rained so didn't spend a lot of time outside on the property). In the winter you can see the neighbors houses and some of the oil well equipment so if your looking for pristine views of the river you will need to hike down to get them. (This is nitpicking and for the price can be overlooked!) No problems with check in or check out and everything in the other good reviews is spot on. Wi-Fi was strong enough for all the surfing and streaming we did when not out hiking!
Overall would rent again for a quiet value packed getaway!"

It was a cute apartment on the first floor of a renovated industrial building, and was very conveniently located to restaurants and views of the Allegheny river, a block or so away. What made it really great for us was that our golden doodle felt right at home, and the place did not feel at all like it had housed other animals in the past. Very clean. Also, Pamela was kind enough to offer us a second room that was adjoining in case we wanted a little extra space for our dog. Definitely did not expect to be in Warren, Pennsylvania, but really glad we were able to discover Pamela‘s place."

Stayed over a week","I stayed at Pam's last year and loved the location and accommodations, so booked again. This year I had a problem with some workers who showed up at 8:00 am on 7/5 playing loud music and wanting to replace the front door that leads into apartment. WTH? Being unaware of this in advance, it really threw off my day (plus I was still on a 3 hour earlier timeframe since I had come from Calif) I got ahold of Pam right away, and she indicated that she didn't expect them to come until Aug or Sept. Again I'm thinking WTH? The next morning they were outside again at 8:00 a.m. music playing wanting to finish the job so they could paint, saying they were there all week to paint the building on that side too...Ugh! It took me 2 days & I finally lost it and expressed my feelings to Pam. The next days got better then. They arrived a little later and they didn't play their music, so I survived it. Pam and I were on good terms when I left, and I've booked again now for next year."

The studio was welcoming with the coordinated decor and how the space was utilized. Most everything looked new and shiny. Loved the comfortable bed and spa- like shower! Although the studio is street level, the outside noises were not interfering at all. Warren was very walkable and felt very safe. There seemed to be quite a few restaurants in the area.
Although I regrettably didn’t have the chance to meet Paula, her friendliness came through on all of her communications. She was very personable.
Definitely recommend this studio, and would extend this recommendation to her other listings based on my stay at the studio"

Stayed one night",The place was EASY to find. Parking was very close and also easy to find. The apartment was quiet and within walking distance of some nice restaurants. It was also charming and very efficient for our visit. The bathroom was very well appointed (yay for large showers!) and the kitchen made me wish we were staying longer in order to cook a simple meal. The bed was comfortable as well. My husband and I slept like rocks after a full day of driving. I hope we can visit again!

It was a comfortable, well-furnished, unit with a newly refurbished bathroom that provided for all our essential needs. It too was value priced. Pamela accommodated any queries we had and communicated with us promptly on all occasions. We certainly recommend it, especially when making it a hub from which to branch out for exploration indoors or out in these picturesque areas of northwest PA and western NY!"

Stayed one night","Very nice little space. In a great neighborhood too. Easy check in.
We forgot to buy creamer at the store so I had to drink my coffee black but it has other staples such as oil and spices. We're able to make dinner and have breakfast purchased at the Tops which is within walking distance.
My only negative(s) are that it was really cold and there was no hair dryer so it was that much colder after we showered. There also was a TV on upstairs and someone walking around as well until at least 1:30am. Didn't keep my boyfriend up and it was just a mild annoyance. Nothing too bad.
Also I have previously stayed with Pam last year and this is a new space in the same building. Very modern and has all the basics like a toaster, Keurig, microwave, fridge, stove and cooking supplies."

The apartment door faces the theater and has an awning over it. The parking spot is about 10 steps away. Pamela's place was definitely worth the price. Really nice!

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Sue's place while I was on an 8 month construction job. The neighborhood is quite, but it is within a very short drive of lots of restaurants and things to do. It has ample off street parking with a well maintained parking lot. The apartment was always squeaky clean, tastefully decorated and has comfortable furniture. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need to make a meal. The entire apartment is extremely well maintained, it has a nice large bathroom and the towels and linens were always clean and smelled good. I cannot say enough good about Sue and her apartments she is a phenomenal host and a wonderful person , she worked with me 100 percent as my schedule changed several times. I give Sue my absolute highest recommendation and will book exclusively with her when my travels take me to the Warren Pa area. You will not be disappointed staying at one of her rentals."

We watched playful ducks ride the creek’s current and fly back and do it again and again. Ideal meditation spot and perfect for just relaxing with morning coffee or afternoon glass of wine. The home is nicely appointed and spotless. We loved sitting in the kitchen where there is a center island stovetop and looking out toward the flowing creek. In short-magical!

She even had a little Christmas tree set up, which was perfect to do our gift exchange! The beds were comfortable and the bedrooms were spacious. There was ample room to relax and connect with our family.
We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Warren- I imagine it only gets better in the warmer weather!"

The bathroom was beautiful just wish there was at least another bathroom since we shared it with another couple. We made it work. Our friends said the master bedroom bed was comfy. And the master closet with changing room was a great place to do hair and makeup. We would stay again! Beautiful home! 🥰

The house is very close to neighbors, but they were friendly and helpful with suggestions for routes since we had never been to the area and were riding our motorcycle. However the outdoor space was perfect and they equipped us with enough wood for a fire by the creek every evening. we heard porcupines, saw deer and duck on the creek and even had chipmunks running around us. we would definitely stay here again. I could not find the guest book or the recommendations for the area. We would definitely stay here again but we would want a vehicle and not just our bike. 😁😁"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely house all clean and updated, kitchen had just about everything with a nice island with stools and a view to the rear yard and the river.
The living room nicely set up for three with a sofa and a comfortable chair opposite the TV. Cozy at night, could use an addition floor or table lamp for reading.
The main bedroom was spacious with a great office area, the sliding modern barn door is lovely so long as you know your friends! Both beds super comfortable. We could not figure out how to use the AC in the bedroom which was not an issue because the neighborhood is super quiet so we slept with the windows open.
Lovely bathroom with a large two person sized shower and a view of the canopy shading the outdoor seating and fire ring, so bring some logs!
Five minutes to downtown, the brewery, 8 minutes to the new, fabulous pickleball courts.
Jaclyn was super helpful with our arrival and departure time.
Would we stay again, five hour drive: yes!"

Jaclyn was super responsive, super nice, and accommodating at an exceptional level. I will also say that the neighbors were super friendly which made our stay even better.

Stayed a few nights","By far the best Airbnb I have even stayed in!!
If you need a house all for yourselves, in a quiet town, in close proximity to amazing trails of the Allegheny National Forest, then Jaclyn’s house is what you are looking for!
Cozy, bright and fully equipped to make everyone feel like home.
Jaclyn you are an excellent host, thank you for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Jaclyn's house for a week-end to enjoy the area and do a few unique things. Walking into the kitchen and downstairs area all is well done very cute decor and you get a great breeze thru the house with windows open. The bed was very comfy and great pillows, there is also a TV in the main upstairs bedroom as well as a wall fireplace for ambiance
It's a quiet neighborhood with nice neighbors, however they were a bit closer than we thought they would be. The back patio is super relaxing watching the water roll by and all the sounds of nature birds, ducks, chipmunks etc but they also start chirping about 3:45 a.m. so if you are a light sleeper they may wake you up as there are many different birds singing all at once.
Jaclyn gave us great suggestions the home is close to town bars, restaurants, a grocery store etc.
We enjoyed our stay and she was great to communicate with everything went very smoothly we were happy with our stay."

Being surrounded by nature was the perfect way to start summer and I really enjoyed the provided fire pit and relaxing Adirondack chairs. The cabin itself had charming furniture/decor and I especially loved the large windows in the sun room. The host even left us a couple gift cards for some shops nearby! There is a stream that provides the perfect white noise for napping with the windows open and a photo worthy footbridge to cross it. The chickens were fun to watch roam around and overall the scenery was very calming. Other than a step onto the porch and into the sunroom, the cabin is all one level making it great for guests with more limited mobility, and the walk from the driveway to the cabin is fairly short. I could see this place being beautiful during any season! All around great vibes!"

Stayed a few nights","This cabin is by far our favorite place - tucked in a secluded, private spot, surrounded by the beauty of nature (and prime for stargazing, which we actually saw the Starlink satellite train) and creatures (we miss watching Bonita, Flora and Sharon), and notedly clean with well-thought and functional intricacies and craftsmanship inside and outside. If you are aiming to feel grounded, disconnect, and recharge even just for a bit, this is the perfect cabin for you! I also cannot say enough about how awesome the hosts are; they went above and beyond in preparation to and during our stay, ensuring we had what we needed and had a wonderful stay! Book now!!"

Stayed a few nights","Incredible place at an incredible price. The setting is top tier. Beautiful scenery, with no loud distractions; just chirping birds, rustling leaves, and the soft sound of a flowing stream. We were in search of an affordable weekend trip, to simply read a book and mentally reset. I can say with confidence there is no better place, especially for this price, than this location here. On top of the incredible setting, the hosts go above and beyond to provide you with anything thing you need… and even surprise you on some mornings with some fresh eggs, courtesy of the 3 resident hens that roam the grounds. They’re not just great hosts here, they’re great people with a level of hospitality that is unrivaled. 10/10. One of our best Air BnB experiences we will likely have. Thank you Scott, Grace, and everyone else behind this property. You are truly appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","We had a superb time at this couple's romantic getaway. The location is quite perfect--it is sufficiently private and isolated but a short drive to Warren (a cute little town at the entrance to the National Forest) and Jamestown, NY (about 25 minutes away). The place itself was very, really perfect for two. Streaming shows is not an option but Grace provides a DVD player and a collection of solid DVDs. We did manage to stream spotify just fine.
Also many little touches--a nice selection of Keurig coffee, creamers, hot cocoa, and even some popcorn. Essential oils to add some nice smells, electric candles to help add soft lighting, etc. Good outdoor lighting to light the way at night, including lights on the bridge and outside by a fire pit. The bed and comforter was very soft and comfortable.
In sum, we had an amazing time and will return. One of our new favorites!
PS Consider bringing a Bluetooth speaker, DVDs, condiments, spices, and wine glasses."

It was so peaceful eating dinner outside and listening to the sounds of the creek. Luckily, we had an exceptionally warm day for the end of October and our son enjoy dipping his feet and throwing rocks in the water.
We were able to check out the kinzau bridge and already said we’d like to come back next fall to check out rim rock! Thank you for your hospitality, we cannot wait to come back!"

My husband is not one to leave our house but he did not want to leave this morning when it was time to come back home.

The overlooks are beautiful in the state parks and forest. Such a great place to unplug and unwind. Really enjoyed drinking my morning coffee by the creek. Grace and co-hosts were so responsive and helpful before and during our stay! Great communication. Scott came to check on the chickens and put them to bed/let them out in the morning. We loved seeing the chickens, they don’t bother you at all and Scott was so friendly! So glad we were able to meet him and chat with him briefly. Overall, a lovely little getaway!

The 2nd bedroom has a trundle bed and both mattresses were very comfortable. Extra pillows and blankets were provided. Fully stocked kitchen, laundry room had detergent and fabric softener, and all the necessities (and more) were provided. We didn't have to worry about running to the store after arriving. The water pressure is amazing! The bathroom is adorable but small and would be uncomfortable for a large person but it was also fully stocked with toilet paper, towels, blow dryer, etc. Chelsea was super friendly and responsive.

On the morning we were to check-in, I emailed Chelsea to see if there was a blender available. She responded right away with, ""If not, we will have one there for you!"" She really went above and beyond our expectations as far as responsiveness, and accommodations. We will definitely be repeat guests!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful, peaceful and well-furnished house in Warren, near the Allegheny National Forest -- We couldn't be more thrilled with our experience. The house itself was impeccably clean and well-maintained, with all the amenities you could possibly need for a comfortable stay. The fully stocked kitchen made it easy to cook meals at home, and the garage parking was a convenient bonus. What stood out was the excellent service provided by Chelsea and Jameson. They were incredibly responsive and went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was enjoyable.
Overall, I had a fantastic experience at this house and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful and comfortable place to stay."

Chelsea & Jameson have created a tranquil, cozy space to spend your time in Northwestern Pennsylvania. They have thought of everything from what you’ll need to make a yummy meal at home, to games & cards tucked away in the desk drawer, a cup of tea or coffee only minutes away, convenient way to wash clothes after a fun day in the Allegheny National Forest, and a beautiful space to rest and relax with your loved ones.
We will definitely be back and are so grateful for their kindness, quick & friendly responsiveness and thoughtfulness.
Lastly, there was a moment we needed something at the house, and within 10 minutes Jameson was at the door. We weren’t expecting him so fast, but it just showed what amazing hosts they are."

Cell reception at the house is pretty sketchy, but the wi-fi is plenty strong and fast. A 1-minute trip down the road brings you to the DMV office, where reception is fine. Very nice place for a couple, with enough space to open the provided single cot and a large fold-out couch in the living room."

If you bring small children, be aware of the Sharpie markers in the Yardzee bucket. My daughter found them first, but disaster was quickly averted, thank goodness!"

Stayed a few nights",This house is in a convenient location for anybody with a boat wishing to launch at Webb's Ferry at the Allegheny Reservoir. The kitchen and bathroom were well equipped/stocked. The host provided plenty of games and movies for entertainment. The back yard was relaxing with the fire and horse shoe pits. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
