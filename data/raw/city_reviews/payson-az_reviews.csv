Stayed a few nights",The air bnb was super clean and beautifully decorated. The tub and the shower were amazing. Walking distance to the park with a pond and to what seemed to be the only late night bar in Payson. The entire property was well maintained with easy check in/check out. Communicative & friendly host

Stayed a few nights","The cabin was clean, cute and comfortable. Getting in was super easy. The owners contacted me to make sure I got in okay and to make sure everything was going well. They have done these cabins so well. In the middle of town on Main Street which has easy access to everything. It was so nice to have a coffee maker provided! Thank you for a wonderful place to rest my head."

Stayed a few nights","The renovation on this eclectic property was very nicely done. Unique custom dual stone shower and antique copper bath tub were an awesome touch. Property was immaculate and well maintained. Really appreciated the excellent wifi and dual TV's with Roku and cable for free. King size bed was very comfortable. This property would be great for couples and also comfortably sleeps four with a sleeper sofa in the family room. Sliding interior barn doors separating spaces was kinda cool, but could be a detractor if maximum privacy is desired. Downtown Payson is pretty industrial and there's not much within walking distance. Property was quiet and peaceful, despite being on main street. Not much to do on site. Would highly recommend for a quiet getaway or as a jumping off spot to do other activities. Strongly suggest having own transportation as public transit is almost non-existant in Payson."

There was a small unforeseen hiccup but Jess and Kimberlie were very attentive and accommodating and we were able to work it out. We LOVED the big bathtub and was shocked that even after filling it up and showering we never ran out of hot water! It has a very cozy western vibe that was perfect and appropriate for Payson. The king bed was huge and comfy! Overall, glad we came and would stay again. :)"

Stayed one night",This was quite a comfortable place to stay. Clean and quiet. A bit of noise from the baby but not terrible and not during sleep time. We did like the bath room and shower. The bed was a little hard for me but tolerable and my husband loved it. The hardest part for us was the 15 steps up to get to the door. After 2 knee and 1 hip replacement it was tough for my husband especially caring heavy suitcases and a cooler up. This was noted in the description though- I must have missed that when I booked. If it was just me I would definitely stay here again.

Everything worked great. The only thing I didn’t enjoy was the bed I slept in. It was very old and very uncomfortable. When my husband got into bed with me, the bed felt like it tilted way to the side and my husband is a normal sized persons as am I.
Getting into the cabin was easy and the location was very nice and close to food and groceries. We had a fun night away."

Stayed with a pet","I rented this cabin for the 4th of July with my husband and two dogs. We had the best time! The place is as cute as can be. It's so peaceful and relaxing. We wanted to get away from the city fireworks and we didn't hear one firework the entire night which was great because my dogs hate them. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and I could sign into my Hulu account to watch movies. The place was spotless and there were so many comfy places to sit outside and read a book. The jacuzzi was really nice. I loved how the cabin was in the city so we can zip down to Walmart but it still felt secluded. I'll definitely be back!"

Stayed with a pet","The Cabin in Payson was adorable! Our family and two dog babies loved our weekend getaway. We went horseback riding at Kohl’s Ranch, and the hot tub did wonders for our sore bodies! Danielle was quickly responsive to any questions we had and was extremely helpful to us. This home inspired minimalist ideas for myself in the future, and all of the neat, unique touches were fun to explore. There were so many fun board games, and we enjoyed them with a much needed family game night. The Cabin had everything we needed and then some. It was well worth every penny! One of our dogs had a little incident and the hosts were so understanding about it. We are grateful! We hope to stay there again some time in the future."

The patios were clean and had comfortable furniture. At first I thought it was a little pricey, but when I got there and experienced all the great things about this place, I felt we got a deal. There were 5 of us and our big dog. We were all comfortable! I would highly recommend this cozy cabin!"

The house had lots of games and movies and the Jucuzzi had the best jets ever!!! Remember to bring your swim suite!
We had small issue, and the host was quick to respond. The host also recommended a local hike (The Tonto Natural Bridge) which we took and it was incredible. Would definitely recommend this cabin :)"

We felt right at home and it was a good amount of space for us parents, a 3 & 6 yr old, and my mom. One morning we sat in the hot tub and watched a herd of elk on the hill behind the house. We cooked meals, sat by the fire, played games, and relaxed. And Payson is fun! We did the Tonto natural bridge, hunted for geodes, saw some ruins and petroglyphs, and hiked a rocky gulch, then had sushi in town. All around fabulous and the kids cried when we left. Thanks for a fun getaway."

I had to still do grad school and the Wi-Fi worked great for me. There were even some board games provided that we played during our stay. The location is close to town, which has a variety of stores and restaurants. It’s also close to a LOT of hiking. That’s why we were in Payson and it was perfect for our purpose."

Stayed with a pet","Cute place to get away. The lake mentioned is a ""manmade"" lake made with reclaimed waste water so if you're expecting to go swimming or entertaining your water pets, this description is misleading. There is no swimming in this small lake. People do fish in it but I can't imagine they are fishing to eat reclaimed waste water fish.
Also, I would imagine that an airbnb would have a small washer and dryer especially for pets (accidents and such) but this place doesn't have such. it was inconvenient and we ended up washing our rags by hand in the tub and hanging them to dry outside.
The shower has zero water pressure. If you like extra long showers here is your chance to enjoy them!
And the neighbor (who is virtually 50 ft away) has a large dog that barked ALL NIGHT LONG. 10pm, 1am, 3am.
While the place is cute, has a musty smell of antiquity, and has its moments of peace, we found these mishaps of negatives almost outweighed the good parts. Wish we had a better experience for our anniv."

Full bed in homes living room probably used best by kids. The mattress frame is pushed against the wall shared with the master, which would make it difficult to get in & out of bed for an adult 4th guest.
Kitchen light access hard to find, just needs to have obvious signage like other lights in the home already appreciably has.

Lots of little touches that make it feel like home.
Nicely stocked with kcups, teas, toiletries and comfy soft throw blankets.
Perfect for a short stay. No laundry to be done here- No washing machine. Which was ok for a 2 nite stay.
There were a few things;
The hanging lights out front had a few bulbs that were out, the door locks were mentioned in another recent review, but we felt safe.
In a prior review Someone also mentioned stained carpet, we did not see that. The cottage was clean and spider web free.
Our only disappointment was the shower. Water did not come out of the shower head. It was after 6p on the weekend when we discovered this. I notified the owner who were sorry, but stated they would not be able to get a plumber out at that time.
We did have running hot water to bathe, just not standing in shower.
Overall great spot, cute clean private cottage.
Thank you !"

Everything was nice and clean, i truly enjoyed the stay. Only concern was the towels smelled like smoke, maybe from the previous folks that came, but it’s was truly a nice place to stay, thank you."

Stayed with a pet",This was a cute little cottage and has lots of potential. I would have given all 5 stars had carpets not been spoiled by pet stains all over. It would have also been nice to have dresser or chest in bedroom to store clothes instead of having to live out of a suitcase when staying more than one night.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed five nights at the cottage and enjoyed it thoroughly. The lake across the main road is fantastic and easily accessible. The cottage is nicely decorated with a very large master bedroom and large bathroom. King bed is amazing! Our dogs were comfortable even though the yard is not enclosed. Watch for early morning Javelina crossing beside the house! Some improvements would make this a five star review. The stained wall-to-wall carpet in the master bedroom detracted from the beauty of the room and the kitchen drawer makes a loud thumping noise when opened. Also, the front and back doors are not easily locked/unlocked and could use some attention. Overall, I would recommend Cynthia’s place as a quiet and restful refuge with all the amenities you will need."

The lake is an easy to walk, and is beautiful is just another benefit of this place!"

Stayed with kids","Cynthia's home was perfect. It was super clean. You normally can tell when a home is pet friendly but this one was cleaned so well it felt like home right away. The beds were comfy and linens clean. The small lake is within walking distance and the kids loved fishing there. Bonus was a group of deer seems to be regulars of the lake and showed up at our front door early in the morning, very cool. The only negative to mention was very minor, the front door is a dutch door and a little difficult to lock and unlock but it was not a problem more something to be aware of. All in all a great stay and we would stay again."

We had a little trouble finding the house in the dark (hint--go past the RV home on the corner, that has the address post, to the dead end) but had no trouble reaching Cynthia for directions. You can walk to a little Lake Park across the street that is really nice. Very quiet and cozy. Would recommend :)"

Stayed with kids",Small cottage near a pond/lake on Main street in Payson was perfect. Just the right size for 2-3 people and very cozy. The cottage was extremely clean and had all the amenities we could possibly want in our stay. Check in was very easy and everything described was as expected. Great place to stay in Payson

We took advantage of the location and walked around the body of water that was no more than 5 minutes across the road. The cottage itself was very clean and very cutely decorated! Would definitely rent again!

Take a tour of the Zane Grey replica house and museum which is just across the road from the cottage. Allow yourself at least 2 hours. We didn't so will return to complete our tour next year. The museum has a lot of interesting history of the Payson and surrounding area. We also went to the nearbyTonto Bridge State Park which was incredible. We hiked down to the waterfalls and bridge entrance, but you can also walk along from the parking lot and access observation areas without a challenging hike up and down the steep areas."

Inside, the couch, bed and all the furniture are colorful, fun, and luxurious. It has a cute loft upstairs with two single beds, should someone have kids. This Airbnb is even fabulous after the sun goes down. It has a hot tub on the deck perfect for watching the stars, which glimmer brightly because there is no light pollution. I booked this place so my friends could celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary and they said they would remember it forever. What an absolutely fantastic place. Well worth every penny spent."

Lesley is such a terrific host and very responsive. Her home is beautiful and river access was a major bonus. When we were out exploring we ran into Lesley's husband and he was just as kind as Lesley, pointing out great spots along the river. With the tress, the stars, the chalet, the fresh air and the peacefulness, I did not want to leave. This was my first time in Payson and now I want to live there in a house on the river! I cannot wait to bring my husband and dog up to Lesley's chalet in the future. I would absolutely recommend Lesley's chalet if you are looking for amazing getaway in Payson!"

Stayed a few nights","Had a fantastic stay at the Chalet! The photos don't do it justice! The cabin was much bigger than we initially thought. Beautiful location, just a few steps away from the east verde river, nestled in the bottom of a valley surrounded by trees. Check-in was simple and easy. Be sure to take screenshots of the check-in instructions because we did not have cell service at the cabin (however it was not an issue because once checked-in, the cabin has fantastic wifi!) The cabin has everything you could need. Watching the stars from the hot tub on the deck was definitely the highlight of the stay. The area is quite and peaceful and the location is great, only about 12 minutes from Payson. The property is easily accessed from a paved road. No need to bring firewood as there is a wonderful electric fireplace. Wish we could have stayed longer! If you're looking for a cabin with unique charm in a peaceful location, you have to try out this beautiful property!"

Stayed a few nights","Lesley is a 5-star host, and her Payson, AZ Chalet was absolutely the perfect place for our Thanksgiving week getaway. Nestled in a private community on the East Verde River, we enjoyed the moon and stars from the hot tub on the deck. The quiet of the high desert surroundings gave us the welcome feeling of solitude with the comfort of being within the friendly Payson East Verde River neighborhood enclave. Our stay was the perfect blend of crisp, cold nights and pleasant late Fall sunny days. The city of Payson is only a ten-minute drive and is big enough to provide every service needed. The Chalet is cozy with beautiful knotty pine interior walls, a full-service kitchen, an excellent shower with a jacuzzi tub, and an overall comfortable, homey feeling. The hot tub was the draw for us, and it did not disappoint - hot, clean, and with a colored light show! The only thing I would mention to future renters is it would be a difficult stay for those with accessibility issues."

The chalet was amazing! We had a great time, relaxing on the patio and enjoying the chalet. The bed was extremely comfortable, the furniture was cozy and the kitchen had everything we needed.
The location was great. We were just a few miles from water wheel falls where we hiked. And also made it to the rim to Willow Springs for kayaking.
We also tried the new Strawberry Lodge Italian restaurant. This is a must try! The food was outstanding the staff was extremely friendly, and the ambience was romantic yet had a bit of history behind the renovation. You definitely don’t want to miss this place!

It’s got the right combination of privacy, convenience and you’re away without being remote.

You’re still close enough to town that you can get to grocery store within 10 minutes."

One of the best things about the Airbnb was the hot tub - it was so relaxing to soak in it while watching the sunrise. Although we couldn't see the sunset from the back of the house, it didn't really matter because we could still move a chair around and enjoy it from the front.
Leslie, the owner, was so sweet and thoughtful. When we arrived, she had left cupcakes on the counter and my daughter was so excited to sing happy birthday 😂 it was def a wonderful surprise!
Overall, our stay at Leslie's Airbnb was amazing and we couldn't recommend it enough."

From start to finish, Lesley was so so so friendly and helpful. She went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect.
We arrived to champagne, dessert, a fully fully fully stocked kitchen, beverages and so much more.
I was blown away by how considerate she was with not only including a coffee and tea station/plates/bowls/cups/seasonings/foil/etc, but she also made check in so beyond easy.
Lesley made sure to help us with restaurant suggestions, things to do, and the local insider tips on where to hangout. Everything was phenomenal. Thank you for providing blankets and robes, I felt so grounded and at peace with nature while staying here. Lastly, it was so quiet!!! If you’re looking to unwind and recharge, this is the place for you.
Thank you for treating us like family."

Lesley gave us tips on fun things to do in the area and they were all great!
The location is close enough to Payson, but far enough away that you feel like you're out in nature, yet you also aren't all alone in the woods. My girls enjoyed walking down to explore the river, too.
There is no cell service but the wifi worked great. We enjoyed star gazing at night on the porch, with no light pollution it was just gorgeous, so many stars! We got to see the lunar eclipse and it was amazing.

Stayed with kids","I’m not one to write reviews however after our experience with this “chalet” and its owner, you need to be aware on what you are getting yourself into while staying here.
Shortly after arriving on a Friday evening, we had dinner on the patio with some of our family (my wife’s 2 sisters) that were camping near by. As the owners live in the house below the property, we watched them drive by slowly, twice, during the course of our meal. Our family was only there for dinner however I was later questioned about our “unregistered guests”
After waking up the next morning, me and my wife had several bug bites on us. We thought they were from our time spent outside however we have a 1 year old baby, and after her morning nap in the master bed, when we went in to wake her up we found 2 bed bugs on the lampshade next to the bed.
After pulling the sheets back, we got photos and videos of almost a dozen live bed bugs crawling around and pockets of old eggs around the bed. After removing our belongings and leaving the property, we went online to let the owner know and we found a previous review from 2 months prior letting the owners know about the problem.
Instead of waking through her yard and up to the house to investigate the review, she just disregarded the review and told them she didn’t believe them.
If someone had actually changed the sheets on the bed we slept in, there’s no chance they didn’t see the several pockets of bed bugs and eggs around the mattress.
2 days after our stay, the bites on my wife were getting much worse so she went to urgent care to get help with them. She was then informed that the bites were infected and was advised to go to the ER to be treated. After going to the ER, they confirmed that the bites were infected and counted 38 bites, all from the same type of bug…after a few miserable days of dealing with almost 40 infected bug bites all over her body, while on an antibiotic cycle, my wife is starting to recover.
The owner did confirm with me that they replaced the mattress and treated the room, however if they think this infestation is solely isolated to the bedroom, it is laughable...

According to the previous review warning about bed bugs OVER 2 MONTHS AGO, with how many (adult) bugs and eggs we found, there’s not a chance this entire little home isn’t infested as it is lined with old, cloth decor.
We booked this stay to enjoy our anniversary weekend in some fresh air, however it was quickly turned into the worst traveling experience we have ever had. Not only our lost costs for the vacation and time off, but the medical bills that we now have from this.
Between the help AirBnb has “provided”, and the way the owner has handled this situation, we will never use this platform again.
DO NOT STAY HERE.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you…
I’ve heard VRBO is a better platform anyway."

We couldn't gave asked for a nicer location for a weekend getaway...it was quiet and remote enough that we could enjoy the silence, yet so close to Payson and neighbors that we didn't feel completely isolated.
The choice of decor was so pleasant and whimsical and almost a little Alice in Wonderland without making you feel like you were staying in a theme park. It was a perfect blend of fun and cute and cozy. Also, the bed was very comfortable!

Stayed a few nights","Bed bugs!! The cabin it’s self was adorable and the location was great. However, it was so dirty!! It didn’t seem that it had been cleaned in between guests AT ALL. They didn’t have clean sponges, the bathroom floor mats which once were light green were black, the sheets didn’t seem clean and as we were leaving I noticed small red bumps covering my torso and legs. I have never experienced bed bugs before but I have no doubt that is what I was bit by after staying in this terribly unclean house. The most disappointing part is the owners live directly below, there is no excuse to have this place be so dirty. Absolutely unacceptable. I don’t know how they have not been shut down sooner."

Stayed a few nights","The ad was a bit misleading. The ad stated 4 people at a certain price, but when 4 people were actually tied into the rental, the price went up $100+. Also, it states its located on 2 acres with waterfront property...which is misleading, because the owners house is also on the property, and, is the house close to the water. The water area was also not suitable for swimming, fishing or anything. Very disappointed in that part, as we planned to fish and hang out there...only to have to travel to another fishing place about 20 mins away...would recommend that the owners revise the ad to be more transparent to future renters."

Back deck is amazing & we felt isolated, like it was our own little spot watching stars & rolling monsoon action from afar! Host is amazing & added wonderful suggestions & feedback, so grateful they “share” their eclectic chalet for a fabulous get away! 🏜 Escaping the valley heat always a bonus."

If you like to hike, bird watch, see the sites, then this is the place! The chalet is equipped with all the modern amenities and the beds are very comfortable. We loved sitting on the deck! The chalet is small so probably only fits up to four people comfortably. Also, due to the stairs and elevated tub/shower, I would not recommend for people with mobility issues. Lesley remained in contact with us and even recommended a variety of restaurants and sites to view."

unique was the character that she put
into it. It looked as if it was made for
Alice from Alice in wonderland. All of

Stayed a few nights","Lesley’s place was in a perfect location and almost exactly what we were hoping to find when booking this air b n b. I say “almost” only because we were traveling with a 9 month old and as anyone can imagine, being out of a normal routine and space can be difficult for a baby. Lesley was very honest when hearing that we were traveling with our baby by telling us the only place a pack n play would fit well was the master bedroom- very true! It was the darkest room with just enough space to fit it. The problem we had was trying to climb into bed ourselves once our baby was asleep- the floor creeks a little and so does the bed- all a perfect recipe to wake the little one up. We ended up sleeping in the two twin beds upstairs, which were really comfortable, and gave the master to our 9 month old! Definitely a trip to remember!
Lesley communicated with us from start to finish and was such a pleasure to rent from. She’s honest, fair, and has such a beautiful property. Coming from Chandler, AZ, this was the perfect distance for a quick get away and loved being outdoors in great weather and nice walks along the creek (which Lesley helped us find an appropriate short cut to get there). We are hoping to come back again soon!
Thank you Lesley for making our stay during our anniversary trip a memorable one!"

Stayed with kids",We were attending an event nearby that would normally involve camping but the year previously was extremely hot and we had several kiddos with us that often got bored. This was the perfect solution for our 3 families. We could go back and forth to the event and have a place for the teens to hide away when they wanted and a kitchen to feed our large group with without missing out on our other activities. The house was lovely and extremely clean and comfortable. If we attend the event next year we might consider skipping the camping a second time.

There was plenty of bedrooms as advertised. The living room was very large, but also a little bit chilly for sleeping on the couch. There’s space heaters and electric blankets provided as shown in each of the bedrooms. The layout of the house has the living room and kitchen on opposite sides of the house but there’s plenty of seating in the kitchen for people to hang out. The USB outlets in the rooms were a really nice touch. The host offered a solution to the only real problem we ran into. There are very in depth instructions sent prior to arrival to guide you through the house."

Stayed a few nights","This was a wonderful stay at a very unique 1934 cabin. Description is accurate and the inside is beautifully updated as the pictures show. Easy to use kitchen with all amenities. The master shower is a nice spa like experience, that was most enjoyable. We happened to be there during the countrywide heat wave, and the AC never skipped a beat. It is set automatically to adjust to a Very Comfortable temp., no need to ever touch it. Easy walking distance to the Green Vally park (even though we didn’t, due to the heat wave). We even got to catch the concert in the park held on Sat. nights. Try not miss this, it’s great family fun with music everyone will enjoy.
The only issue we had was, the back door (handle specifically) was locked by mistake. Causing the door not to open when entering the code provided.
But, we sent a message to Boyd and within the hour he responded with a quick solution. Yay!! So please be sure NOT to touch the door knob lock. The dead bolt is all you need.
Thank you Boyd, for a wonderful stay!!We’ll be sure to stay here again the next time we come to Payson."

Stayed with kids","This place was great over all, and then some! Everything you need was available. I brought many ""little"" things that my family and I personally wanted to have like ear plugs, lighter for the fireplace and fire pit, and roasting sticks. But we didn't need to because Boyd's place had it all! I was very impressed with all the thoughtful extras in addition to the main amenities. We had an issue with something being found by my 3 year old that was left behind from someone that could have been a serious issue but thankfully wasn't too bad. I wish we would have been reimbursed the cleaning fee for that issue but I'm confident they will push for more diligence in cleaning going forward so it doesn't happen to anyone else. My husband left his beloved hat when we left and Boyd is making arrangements for us to get it back which is also very appreciated. Again, overall a fantastic place and we would stay again."

I was mostly impressed with the quality of the bed and bath linens... superior. Beds were very comfortable and location was quiet ...on the Main Street but no traffic noise...probably because it was set back from street and on a higher level. Very peaceful. House was equipped brand new and the renovations were impressive. We would like to go back another time! Thank you!

Stayed with kids","Boyd’s place is an absolute DREAM! I actually don’t want to give it an honest review, for fear that it will be booked up once word gets out.
The house is spacious, very clean, perfect for our two small families (4 adults, 1 child, 1 baby).
We cooked, we used the family room every night. We used the laundry facilities, and enjoyed dinner and cocktails outside during an awesome thunderstorm.
We didn’t use all the available amenities, but we’re looking forward to going back and enjoying the fire pit or maybe the fireplace inside.
Great location to all commercial areas, and walking distance to the park, where my niece got to go fishing in the pond.
I highly recommend staying at Boyd’s Place, just as much as I encourage you to NOT stay... so it will be available when we want to go back. 😁
Thank you Boyd!"

We were very comfortable and had everything we needed. There were many little touches that we enjoyed. He seemed to have thought of almost everything. It was also very nice to have a place where we could bring our dogs. The fenced yard is spacious with plenty of room for them to run. If we come back to Payson this is where we would like to stay."

The place is a little shabby on the outside but you can tell they are working on the home. The inside was clean. The couches a little old and need some love. But other than that the kitchen was wonderful.....had everything you need to cook a meal. Very well stocked with pots, pans, plates, coffee pot, keriug, blender, etc. There was also a very nice park down the street which we took a few late evening strolls. Overall felt very safe.
Also fyi there is a small building behind the rental where I believe the people who look over the property stay at. They were nice and quiet. Tha is again for letting us stay at your rental."

When we pulled up we noticed right away how clean the exterior windows looked. Once inside we could see & smell how freshly cleaned everything was!! Beds were comfy and sheet smelled so clean! The AC wasn’t working properly and George offered to send someone to fix it the following day. Because it wasn’t too hot yet and he supplied fan we declined. He was very apologetic an even asked if he could compensate us. As nice as his offer was we declined bc he was such a gracious host and continued to check in to make sure we were all good.
I was MOST impressed by his instruction book!!! It was a full comprehensive review of everything we needed to know! Including things to do in town! It was quite refreshing! We will definitely stay again if ever back in the area!"

Stayed about a week","Wife and I really enjoyed the place. It's very modern and clean inside. Easy entry - a key point as lots of places in hilly Payson have steep driveways and entrance stairs - this one has level parking and two steps up and in. Comfy beds and furniture. Convenient to many area stores and restaurants in Payson. Nice quiet neighborhood. Great appliances and lots of staples you often don't find in rentals- oil and spices, not to mention a K cup coffee maker with lots of supplies. Weather wasn't great during our March stay, so didn't get to enjoy the pleasant front porch but once, nor the backyard. Charming electric fireplace that has a nice heat setting. Our only negative - the furnace is loud when it's running. We learned to adapt by turning up heat before bedtime, then turning way down(nice Nest thermostat) so it wouldn't kick in again until 3-4 am. This worked well during a chilly week in March- nighttime temps in low-mid 30's."

If you plan to have an evening in the backyard just be aware there is a single light at the back door and it gets too dark outside to see anything. It is located in a very quiet/private neighborhood."

George is always available and very helpful.
The house is in a rather quiet neighborhood. People are kind and friendly.
Sometimes the Weißwedelhirsche come to the front yard.

The house is spotlessly clean, has a warm ambience & much thought went into providing everything a traveler might need during their stay. Great central a/c & 5 star beds! We had fun playing all the board games in the closet and the outdoor games in the shed outside. We grilled salmon and steaks on the propane grill & enjoyed relaxing in the back patio."

Stayed with kids","Geroge,
Thank you for hosting us. Thank you for being so accommodating and creating a wonderful space for our family to stay in while getting out of the city. Your home made us all feel SAFE and honestly the security cameras were what did that for me personally... Having small little children, we never are able to sleep with the windows or doors open but at your property we were all able to sleep with the house open so we could breathe the fresh air. Thanks to your security cameras, which I feel is what usually deters anyone who would have malicious intent. The patio was the best part, your home is to die for. All the decor and little touches made the home even that much better. You had the best channels on TV and the bedding is so soft very luxurious & the fans in the closet for some extra air flow during the days was absolutely perfection. We will be staying again and appreciate YOU making our FIRST air bnb stay the best ever. God Bless You!"

We saw elk both days, and at one point we had two elk come right up to the porch- literally within feet of us. They stayed a while and ate the grass. The beds are comfy, and the kitchen and bathroom have all the basics, and then some. I think you could pretty easily cook a full meal here. Coffee is provided. ☕️🎉 The front porch rocking chairs are very nice, and the neighborhood is quiet. Check-in was hassle-free. George communicated perfectly. Overall a 5-star experience. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤗"

Stayed with a pet","Highly Recommend, Spent 3 nights and checked out Christmas Eve. We as a family of 4: 2 adults, 2 fury family members (dogs) boarder collie, golden retriever, we felt right at home as soon as we all crossed the threshold of the front door, which is important because the atmosphere was very comfortable and the cabin had great energy. The environment was clean and very inviting. The primary’s bed was extremely comfortable.We appreciated that there was a stocked kitchen with a variety of utensils, silverware, plates and cookware to make us feel at home. The Cabin was decorated for us with Christmas decorations and the fireplace was a wonderful functioning atmosphere for our warm evenings.The exterior property was large and fenced in, it made us feel safe and secure especially for our beautiful dogs to run free. The tankless water heater was an awesome touch as it provided instant hot water to our showers and dishes . Where already planning are next return trip to Bellarina Log Cabin."

What we did experience was needing an additional bathroom. Our 2 year old a grandson loved the toys in the little hallway. We didn't expect to see them and his face lit up! It was VERY easy to hear into the next room. It was a very nice little cabin😊"

Stayed with kids",My family and I enjoyed our stay at BellaRina Log Cabin! The fenced in yard was perfect for my two grandchildren. The firepit was very enjoyable in the evenings to roast hot dogs and marshmallows. We ate our evening meals outside at the table with plenty of chairs for everyone. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking. The bathroom was clean and spacious. We all slept great in the three bedrooms. The cabin has a rustic feel with all the comforts of home! We enjoyed a couple of outings to Green Valley Park where we walked around the lake and fished and Rumsey Park where the kids played on the playground. It was nice having a place near town for some last minute runs to Walmart. Catherine is an excellent host and always responds quickly. We all decided that we want to come back to BellaRina again!

We were there during extreme heat and never even adjusted the two AC units. Very comfortable, very quiet and you are just on the edge of town so easy to get anything you need. And we saw elk nearly every night."

Stayed with kids","Overall the place was really nice. The lockbox for the key was a bit of a challenge, might be that the numbers weren't very large and I didn't have my glasses! All interior surfaces were clean (i.e. the counters, floors, furniture). After being there and seeing the photos again, the kitchen is a bit small (lack of counter space). The furniture inside was all very comfy. Even though there is only one bathroom, it was pretty big. A/C is in the dining room and master bedroom, that doesn't quite make it too the living room, bathroom or other bedrooms. That said, being were were there during one of the hottest weeks of the year, it wasn't bad in the other rooms during the day. The 3rd bedroom had a swamp cooler that wasn't working during our stay. The yards were huge and fenced (both front and back, each separate but accessible to each other). The outdoor furniture took us 20 minutes or so to cleanup all the cobwebs. This is a country cabin setting, expect animal noises."

Stayed with a pet","Cozy cabin with a nice stone fireplace. The backyard was nice for my toddler and dog to play in. Catherine was a very responsive host. Having stayed here for 5 weeks, we felt that there were some wonky things about the cabin - such as the kitchen light that doesn't always turn on and the bedroom light that can only be on with the fan on (in 20 degree weather, brr!). Note for anyone with light sleepers and/or remotely working: The bedroom doors are open slab kind of doors, so noise really travels throughout the home. We enjoyed being close to some fun trails and parks, including Water Wheels Falls and Green Valley Park."

Located in Payson, brings traveling to the store a breeze. Close to many hiking trails (we hit 3 of them). Our host, Catherine, was easy to communicate with, very prompt replies (very prompt!), and courteous. JoEllen, the property manger, lives next door and is super friendly.

Stayed with a pet","Had a very nice relaxing time. Loved hearing the creek while sitting on the patio and it’s wonderful having the completely fenced yard so my dogs could run around and explore. The only negative thing I could say is there’s no cell phone service so I could not pull up the instructions for entry. It would’ve been handy to know to screenshot those beforehand so I had access. I had to drive back down the mountain quit a bit to get cell service to pull up the information. But other than that, everything was great!"

Stayed with a pet","Christopher was proactive in letting me know about the winter road conditions which was appreciated. He was very responsive.
As other reviews have mentioned, download a map or instructions to the cabin as once you get out of town there is little to almost zero cell phone service. Also, keep in mind this cabin is somewhat remote, so if there is snow, you will almost likely need a vehicle that is capable of driving in the snow or on snowpack.
The cabin itself was cozy and the decor was unique and nicely done. This was a perfect place for a weekend getaway with my pets. The property is fenced in completely. The deck was great for enjoying a morning cup of coffee and gazing at the bright stars at night.
Overall, this cabin is a very peaceful place. I would recommend staying here, and I would absolutely stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","My fiancé and I came up here with our two dogs for my birthday and absolutely loved our stay! This cabin was perfect for us. We loved the porch and enjoyed watching our dogs roam freely and safely on the enclosed, huge property. The pines surrounding the yard were so peaceful and it sort of felt like you’re up in a tree house which was so cool. Waking up and having coffee in the crisp weather, sitting in the rocking chair while listening to the river roaring in the distance was truly what I loved most. Walking in the river with my dogs is a close second though. We walked around the river a few times throughout our stay and loved it more each time! Listening to the water was so healing for the soul. The record player was such a cool vibe, and I was obsessed with the lava lamp and salt rocks! The decor was so cute and the kitchen had the cutest vintage modern touches. We will definitely be back!"

There’s a loft w/ 2 beds & an A/C, which we never used because it was just two of us and our 2 spaniels. They absolutely loved the freedom of a fenced off property. We will definitely be back soon!

Group trip","Loved this rental for so many reasons. The space was perfect for our family of 7! We traveled from far and while majority of our extended family stayed the weekend at a campsite, we opted to stay at an Airbnb for comfort and boy did we get COMFORT! As soon as we walked in, it felt like home. The house was spacious, there was every amenity you could think of, all the shower needs were included, also the beds were so comfy that I now want to buy those mattresses for our home! As far as any questions or concerns, Sofia was available to answer my messages within minutes. There is a family who lives above on the second floor but they do not have in-door access to the first floor (the one in which we stayed at). The family upstairs was sweet and respected the quite hours promptly. Overall, this stay was a 10/10. We would definitely book with the hosts/this home again if we were in the area."

Stayed with kids","Both my husband and I are managers at a vacation rental company on Amelia Island, FL, so we know what it takes to offer a great guest experience! Sofia has really put a lot of thought into her property and has gone the extra mile to make you (and your kids) feel at home. Our 7 and 9 year olds immediately loved the living room space and the toys/kids books. That was really helpful while we were unloading! They also loved the little door basketball goal in the hallway. The homemade cookies were a nice surprise! Flavored water in fridge was nice. Coffee and creamer provided were appreciated (of course!) Now for the beds: so comfortable! As hosts, Sofia and her mom were very communicative, preemptive, and thoughtful. If we are ever back in Payson, we will be back!!"

In the last few years, countless journeys from the US and Europe and I can honestly say, this is the first place I've gone where I felt I was staying with family and not some random turn over.
There is a warmth and kindness the second you enter. I saw all this through gracious gifts and personal touches. From homemade cookies to snacks and refreshments, this is an amazing and positive space.
The home is quiet, among friendly neighbors, and must sees.
I am extremely grateful having been a guest here. Thank you for everything ❤️"

Nice little touches around the house include coffee and k-cup pods, fresh fruit, candies, creamers and soft drinks as well as spices and kitchen necessities. The livingroom/kitchen area is a comfy place to hang out. We brought our doggies bed and he had a relaxing stay also. Everything you need is right there! Beds are firm and comfortable with quality linens and pillows. We ate at our favorite local restaurant, Duza's Kitchen, 3 times during our 2 night stay. Everything in Payson is just minutes from this chalet including shopping, dining and outdoor activities. Super easy to find and park. We met up with friends from the valley (and we are from the White Mountains) for a birthday celebration. It was a perfect 1/2 way point. We will be back for sure!"

All in all, it was a very pleasant stay, and I would definitely stay there again. The only negative is that sometimes you could hear the tenants on the upper floor walking around - but that stopped at night, thankfully."

Everything was considered for every possible guest who would stay there. Four beds provided places for eight to sleep. Children’s books and balls as well as a high chair were available for families. Games and Apple TV were supplied. Even the code to unlock the door was customized for us, simplifying the entry process. My husband has muscular dystrophy, so he appreciated the stand-up shower that he could easily walk into. I can’t think of any possibility that was not considered. We were a little leery of the upstairs tenants making too much noise, but it wasn’t bad at all. Except for hearing the occasional walking around, we kept forgetting about them. The home is in such a peaceful setting."

Beds were very comfortable. Has one large bathroom and then another half bath which were both very nice! Furniture very comfortable to relax on. We had fun playing various games. The coffee bar was wonderful. Extra snacks were an added bonus, along with a half gallon of vanilla ice cream and stuff to make s’mores . It was a little too chilly to make a fire in the fire pit. But we still enjoyed the s’mores. We loved everything about this place!! Would definitely stay here again if back in the area!"

There was a neat snack basket filled with a variety of snacks and the coffee bar was well stocked with a variety of coffees and teas. The neighborhood is very quiet with beautiful views of The Rim. We spent time outside by the fire and at night we played games and watched movies. We loved that it was nestled in a neighborhood that was 5 minutes from stores.

We enjoyed the BBQ along with the few snacks and drinks she offered. The Stocked coffee bar was a nice treat on a cold morning as well. Lots of nice little touches to make your stay enjoyable. There were also board games and activities for children so I would recommend this place for a family for sure. The little extras stood out as well like shampoo etc. You can tell when a host goes above and beyond and Sofia is one of those hosts. Thank you Sofia for the extra little things that made this a very enjoyable stay. We have already booked 2 more stays with her. I highly recommend.

She even went out of her way with wood for the fire pit. It was a great neighborhood and a beautiful house. Check-in and check-out were simple. The host did not require the guest to do anything besides locking the door when leaving. Everything you could need was provided including a play pen and high chair. The beds were in great shape and the house was clean and comfortable. It had a beautiful patio with propane bbq. Can't recommend this place enough! We will absolutely be staying here when we are in the area!

Easy to get on the major roads whether you are heading to Woods Canyon Lake or Tonton Natural Bridge State Park. The setup of the cabin can accommodate two families; although we were only a group of two we felt the thoughtfulness of the hosts by their equipping the house with more than enough towels, bedding, coffee, tea, games, and so on. We enjoyed the ambiance, the entire stay gave us warmth as well as peace just like our home. We will recommend this cabin and the hosts."

Nice pots and pans for cooking. Plenty of counter space. I didn’t check but I’m pretty sure the beds are tempurpedic. I say this because sleep was glorious. Beds in one room were on softer side, while beds in other were a little firmer. Great to have a choice when you travel. Shower pressure was great. Great to have laundry right there in the unit, but out of the way. Wi-Fi was great for my remote work trip. Great neighborhood for walking. My dog just loved it too. Host was quick to respond. I’ve traveled pretty extensively and this is now one of my favorite spots."

Stayed with kids","One of the cleanest and best appointed AirBnB's I have ever stayed in. The layout was perfect with two huge bedrooms each with two big comfortable beds. I have stayed in Payson before and this is definitely the side of Payson you want to stay in. Some of the AirBnB's to the West and South are in neighborhoods that are far less welcoming. You won't be disappointed staying here. The host shares that the driveway is steep, but our Chrysler Pacifica had no problem, or you can just park in the lower parking spot. Overall a super nice place to stay. I would say it's the best value in all of Payson."
