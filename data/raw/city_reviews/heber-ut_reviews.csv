Group trip",Very nice place inside with workable kitchen and nice bedrooms. Great location if you have activites in Heber City or don't mind the drive to Park City for skiing. It was base of Timber Moose lodge where our family was gathering for a wedding so it was conveniently located.

The space is an amazing mix of cool 1970's construction with updated interior design. It's a great place to unwind with lots of fun shops and restaurants close by when you are ready for something else. Loved our stay!

The location is close enough to the ski slopes to not be a schlep but far enough to experience the beautiful scenery and views. Peaceful but not isolated. Recommended."

Group trip","The A-Frame Haus is a beautiful, cozy place to get away, relax, and spend time with family & friends. Beds and pillows were super comfy and there was plenty of room for 6 to enjoy time together playing games or to spread out and have some quiet time. And there are plenty of activities just a short drive away.
Kara is a great host and is quick to respond to questions. Thank you for sharing your beautiful A-Frame Haus with us, Kara!"

Group trip","The most idyllic little a frame in Heber. No detail is spared in Kara’s cabin. The aesthetic and finishes are unmatched. It is warm, cozy, and just feels like home. The beds and linens were a dream while falling asleep looking out the many skylights connecting you with the nature surrounding. Many cups of coffee and glasses of wine were enjoyed while starting and ending our days on the beautiful back deck. If you want to feel like you have truly escaped but still have the convenience of being just outside of town, this is the spot for you."

Stayed a few nights","The cabin was cute and well maintained, with great bathrooms and kitchen. It was very clean, including the deck, and there were fewer insects than expected. Kara was a great host - very fast and friendly responses to my questions/comments but with limited expectations and demands on me, which made for a comfortable and stress free stay. I was a little disappointed about the level of road noise heard inside and outside the cabin, but I’m assuming this depends a bit on the time of year (perhaps an unusual amount of side by sides around Labor Day, for example)."

It’s a whole lot more expensive now for whatever reason so we could only stay a couple nights, but man this place is beautiful. We would definitely love to come back. I’m sure it would be a lot of fun with a small group of pals, but even for just the two of us, it was such a cozy little temporary home."

Really enjoyed the big deck and cooking together in the nice open kitchen/living area. My only gripe would be no door on the upstairs bathroom or bedroom, I get it was for space, but I am a fan of just a wee bit of privacy. Kara responded quickly and everything was just picture perfect. I would definitely stay there again!"

The upstairs was pretty hot so turn on the AC as soon as you arrive to try and cool it down... we had the sliding door open at night, but closed it due to some spider friends coming inside. Otherwise a great stay! Kara provided bottled water for us which was super helpful. Beautiful views. Not really anywhere to play outside (the brush is super thick and high), but we went into town to play at the park and ride the Heber Creeper Train. Great cabin for playing board games and watching the sunset and relaxing. Kara was a great host!"

We brought our side by side and rode trails near by and one of our favorite, Snake Creek above Midway- less than 30 min drive. Great places to go out and eat that are fairly close but you still feel secluded from near by towns. Our kids were so sad to leave and we really enjoyed our time at the A-frame!"

The door on the downstairs bathroom is not that private and there is only a curtain on the upstairs bathroom. Also while the skylights are beautiful it would be really nice to have some kind of shade covering in the bedrooms. All in all we enjoyed our stay.

Stayed with kids","The cabin is wonderful. It has an outstanding style which makes it perfect to spend your day reading, cooking, writing, just being inside. The location is also great, you are actually close to Heber but it looks like if you were in the middle of nowhere. Whereas going outdoors could be appealing, its wonderful interior will make you want to stay inside the cabin enjoying the nature through the big window of the living room. That is the biggest pro to me.
However if our stay was not perfect was because some amenities (stove, dvd and grill) did not work well. We also had an unexpected guest (mouse) which was more a surprise than an issue since we understand it can happen in a cabin like this. Nevertheless, when you pay such an amount of money you expect everything to be perfect. It was not the case. We informed the host about these problems the night before our departure. Being true there was probably not time to fix it, we would have appreciated they had made the effort to try it and not just an apologize text."

The location was beautiful and secluded, the space was even more beautiful than I imagined (and I’d been following along on Instagram for awhile) The a-frame was super spacious compared to ones I’d been in before, very clean, Kara was so nice and helpful in the planning process and she was great with communication too. I’d highly recommend staying here, expectations were met and exceeded!!"

The heat didn’t work well , the water smelled of sulfur and the WiFi didn’t completely work. You could text but not call.

Stayed with kids","The A frame haus was such a magical holiday escape for our family! The cabin is absolutely gorgeous, very comfortable and located near some very cute towns. We stayed for Christmas and there was a sweet little tree under which to place presents for our two year old. Kara was extremely sweet and accommodating, providing two humidifiers for us to use. The cabin was a bit less remote than I had expected, it’s right on the road. I would also be aware that the property is on a well and the water will have a sulfur smell to it. Bottled drinking water is provided though so that helped tremendously! Loved this place!!"

There is also a creek that runs near the cabin where my husband, myself and our toddler spent lots of time exploring. The cabin itself has everything you need for a relaxing vacation. It's a perfect place for children as there are books, toys and puzzles along with the secret room upstairs that my toddler spent lots of time playing in. Kara has done an incredible job curating the spaces to feel modern, clean, peaceful and comfortable. We will definitely be back!"

The porch out front on the west side is enormous and the house is filled with natural light. We had two 5 year-old boys here for the weekend and they found plenty to do with the blocks and games available for kids and enjoyed collecting sticks/rocks outside. Kara is an attentive and accommodating host. We did not have any cell phone reception on Verizon or AT&T at the cabin, but the wireless internet worked great so we could take care of any quick communication needs back home that way. We'll be back for another stay for sure."

Lastly, my family and I laughed out loud when we saw the entire collection of The Office in a basket by the TV, it’s our favorite show. Kara definitely has it all down:) checking in was easy and she communicated fast and nicely. Thanks again!"

Stayed with kids","This Airbnb has a page to follow on Instagram with fun pictures of the remodel and pictures from people who’ve stayed before. It’s really such a beautiful cabin right off the road, it was super easy to find. It’s completely been remodeled and is stunning. It’s super clean and had everything we needed. They provided linen, towels, even shampoo and conditioner. It has a fully stocked kitchen. We were able to prepare breakfast and dinner in the spacious kitchen. They have a drawer full of games and dvds and kid toys which was a bonus! It was warm when we got there, especially upstairs but the cabin has a Nest and only took 30 minutes to cool down. Check-in and check-out was super simple. She gives you the key box code and you go right in and lock up when you leave. She only asks that you take out your garbages and put your dishes in the dishwasher before you leave. Overall I loved our stay and I highly recommend. We will definitely be returning in the future."

It was much larger than you'd expect an A-frame to be (can probably accomodate 6 people comfortably), extremely clean and well-stocked with all the necessary items (shampoo, clean towels, coffee, The Office DVD's), and the views were just great. The best part of all this is the host, Kara. We notified her that we'd be coming in very late at night due to a late flight and she drove up to leave the lights on for us so we wouldn't have any issues finding the house. She responds quickly and provides all information clearly.
I will definitely have to come back. Highly recommended!"

Kara is a lovely host. She was patient and helpful when we had questions and concerns. She was also very understanding with us about an issue we had that was not communicated prior to arrival. She worked with us to get the situation resolved in a very generous and thoughtful way.
My only heads-up comment would be that there is not a washer/ dryer on the premises, and although the listing doesn’t say there is one in the amenities section, I just assumed. Which was my bad.
Overall a wonderful experience."

Stayed a few nights","This was an exceptional place to stay. The house is amazing and very well done. We stayed there with our 4 kids and everyone loved it. The kids enjoyed playing in the little nook above the upstairs bed, and they really enjoyed hiking down to the creek bed just below the house to go exploring. There's no water this time of year but they collected rocks and sticks and had a great time.
My wife really enjoyed the kitchen and cooked meals every night. Everything she needed was there. Everything is well furnished and decorated.
The proximity to downtown Heber is very nice. It feels like you are further away than you are. Just a quick drive in to get ice cream or anything else you need.
Garrett & Kara were always very responsive and polite with any questions we had.
We will definitely be going back."

Stayed a few nights","Secluded but within proximity to Heber and Park City (and plenty of outdoor activities), the location of A-frame Haus is incredible for your next getaway. But it is the architecture, design, and overall feel that will have you falling in love with this place. There is attention to detail everywhere, but it doesn't deliver a busy feeling, more so a minimalistic, peaceful one. The style is sophisticated but comfortable and the white, beach cabin-esque open areas serve as blank slate for new ideas or forgetting your troubles. The hosts are so friendly and were quick to respond to any questions I had. They live nearby and can be at your service in a jiff. Also noteworthy about them, you really just feel like you have known them for years once you meet them. I can't wait to go back. -JJ"

Stayed a few nights","We cannot tell you how much we loved staying in this amazing cabin! It is so cozy, welcoming, quaint, and decorated beautifully. My 8 year olds first words when we walked through the door were, ""Please say this isn't just a dream!"" There is a cute ladder that goes up to small storage space in the master bedroom. My kids turned it into their playroom, and must have climbed up and down it 500 times during our 2 day stay! We were all sad to leave but will definitely be back again (hopefully very soon)!"

We wanted to take pictures in every room and from every angle of the property because it was such a beautiful and exceptional space. My friends and I scrapped our plans to go out to dinner in Heber City and opted instead to bring groceries home and eat meals in their fantastic kitchen to maximize our time in this environment. Just spending time in the house itself is an experience and I think it is an ideal location for a family reunion, romantic getaway or any other experience that is focused on intentional quality time with people you love!"

The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed to save some money a couple of nights during our stay so we could cook there. A couple of parks nearby offered options for the kids. On-site washer and dryer allowed us to keep up with the laundry and host had some baby items available in the rental so we were able to save some room in the car. 10/10, would use this place again."

The place was pristine clean and the bed in the theater room was made up which made us feel welcomed right away. The theater room was spacious and cozy. The kitchen was well equipped with everything you’d need even kid friendly dishes, and bakeware. The gas stove was a nice perk. And the shower was heavenly. The attention to detail was greatly appreciated as there were clear instructions on how to operate everything. Sitting around the fire with tons of firewood to roast marshmallows with was a wonderful experience. Our favorite thing was hopping inside the hot tub every night. What a way to relax. Really set us up for a good night’s sleep. Another favorite was having breakfast outside on the patio furniture. We enjoyed every minute and can’t wait to be back!"

We loved using the hot tub at night and the patio with all the lights, made for such a beautiful romantic getaway! The theater was so much fun and so comfy, felt like we had our very own private movie theater. They had everything you could need for a home away from home. We didn't want to leave!

Stayed a few nights","Such a beautiful stay. We hiked, played at Deer Creek reservoir, visited local restaurants from Jake’s recommendations, and tried to find a way to be their new neighbors! Ended up in park city for a dinner - super quick and easy to get to! Drove home through Provo, also really easy, short drive. We can’t wait to head back and explore more!"

Stayed with kids","Jake and Amanda have created a beautiful getaway that was perfect for our little family. The kids had a great time playing in the yard and playground, roasting marshmallows in the fire pit, exploring on the trail and watching movies in the home theater. The work they put into the property is very apparent and has created a tranquil place to stay.
A vey welcome surprise was how well the hosts treated any questions we might arise from us guests. They left laminated instructions highlighted everything from controlling the air conditioning to using the hot tub and the home theater which was extremely helpful.
Lastly, the hosts were very accommodating, communicative and responsive. We will definitely be coming back to stay here the next time we visit if we can and I would recommend the same to anyone."

We would not hesitate to book again and recommend to others. Thank you Jake!"

Stayed a few nights","In a beautiful location and an amazing neighborhood. The rental itself was spotless and everything felt very nice inside. The home theater was a real treat too!
One thing that I saw at least one other reviewer mention too is that you don’t really have full (any?) control over the cooling/heating system within the place. The vents were blowing cold air when I had the thermostat off. Fortunately the owner was out of town so they were able to have someone local come over to turn off the upstairs system and that resolved the issue for me."

Stayed about a week","This was our second stay at Jake’s place. Last time was March when there was lots of snow on the ground. This time, middle of July with beautiful mild mornings and hot afternoons. When not fishing on the Provo, we relaxed on the Adirondack chairs in the shade enjoying a beautiful breeze. So peaceful and relaxing. The apartment was wonderful…as before…very clean and well appoint. We made good use of the bbq grill and the TV room. We hope to visit Jake’s place again soon."

The property backs a large open undeveloped area where we had plenty of deer visit each day. The place is very clean with nice amenities like a convection oven/microwave, rainfall shower, echo dot for music, fireplace, leather recliners, 3 rows of theater seating with one folding out to a bed, large picture window that made it nice and bright, dedicated parking area and separate entrance. Great location to get away but within 10 minutes to downtown Heber.
Definitely recommend staying at Jake’s place and would book it again."

Unfortunately it had snowed recently, meaning that the fire pit and chairs were totally covered and not usable, but there was still plenty of other great stuff to do. This is definitely one of the best Airbnbs I've ever been to and I highly recommend it."

Jake does specify that his family with kids live upstairs and to expect some noise, but we found that the noise was only noticeable during the early evening when we were up making noise of our own. The kids settled down well before our bedtime and it was quiet and peaceful. Thanks Jake and family for a wonderful stay!"

(We realize that the host said there would be noise upstairs in the ad.) But all in all it was a very nice welcoming stay in a beautiful environment."

The apartment was cozy, and we had beautiful views out of every window (including horsies in neighboring ranches). We got to play in the snow right outside, there was a lot of open space if you wanted to build a snowman or have a snowball fight.
Parking was super easy and comfortable. Midway was lovely, and we got a full 4 days of activities just in the local area.
Highly recommend this stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Melynne’s home was better than described and pictured. The home instructions emailed ahead of time were spot on and we loved the keyless entry. She was an exceptional host and communication was easy.
We were less than 1/2 mile to the Homestead Crater. Our primary trip goal was for my 16 year old nephew to become Open Water Dive certified. Which we accomplished - yay! Melynne’s home was the perfect “home” away from home to relax. The kitchen was one of the best stocked kitchens I’ve seen at Airbnb rentals, although we didn’t use anything because the suggested restaurants in town were delicious! Great host, crater and town. We would highly recommend and would definitely return! If your trip involves the Crater, Rich and Lori are amazing!!!!"

Group trip",So happy we found this. It is beautiful and clean. I was worried it would be too small for our froup of 6 but it was perfect. We loved it. Melynne allowed our group to roam and take advantage of the huge property. It was the first time my 4 year old niece had experience snow and it wqs a great experience! Thank you Melynne.

Stayed a few nights","I came to Midway, UT to get my PADI Open Water certification at Homestead Crater and found a beautiful place that I couldn’t resist to book and this was the best decision ever!
Although it was supposed to be a girls trip and my friends canceled last minute, I still came (solo trip) and enjoyed the entire place for myself.
Checkin was super easy and I greeted by Christmas songs 🎄
Melynne’s place is awesomely beautiful, I can see mountains from the right and left windows
Place is quiet, peaceful and super clean.
I definitely will recommend this place to the scuba shop I took my certification with and would bring my husband to stay here if we ever coming back to Midway!"

When I pulled onto the Estate I felt that I must have the wrong place. I was amazed that my family was welcomed and made to feel at home at such a beautiful place! By far the best Airbnb I have ever visited."

Stayed a few nights","Jeannine’s Zen Den was perfect for us. We couldn’t ask for anything more in an Airbnb. This is not only now our favorite place to stay in the Heber/Park City general area, but it is easily in our top three Airbnbs.
Here are some examples of the nice things we experienced:
1. Personal welcome note inside
2. Rack for shoes at the entrance
3. Refrigerator with a good freezer - we love ice!
4. Convenient washer/dryer
5. Notification of some cool local events
6. Nice temperature control system
7. Sound machine for sleeping
8. Comfortable bed, sheets, and pillows
9. Nice shower and tub
10. Very peaceful and quiet
We basically needed a place to sleep and get cleaned up, so we didn’t use the full-size kitchen and well-furnished TV room, but if someone also needed those then this place would be awesome for that.
Jeannine is an excellent host."

Loved waking up in the morning to see the hot air balloons in the sky and the gorgeous mountains. Plus you literally drive right by Dutch Bros Coffee on your way out to your adventures. Close drive to Jordanelle and Park City without the price tag. City has public transit and location is 2 blocks from shopping and restaurants."

The Zen Den is in one of the most convenient locations in Heber, right near anything you'd ever need, and it's well-stocked with all the basics (plus some) you'd need to feel at home. The entire suite was spotlessly clean, welcoming, and quiet, and the bed was divinely comfortable. There were cooking utensils in kitchen drawers, a mini pantry of non-perishable essentials in the cupboard, and a full-sized fridge with a variety of condiments. Jeannine was a fantastic host—she replied to messages immediately, and she was respectful of our privacy while also eager to help with anything she could. Overall, it was very comforting to know we had this safe place to stay while visiting family in town. We'd love to stay again were we invited back."

The apartment was spotless clean!
The linens are amazingly soft !!!
Other nice touch was , multiple Kleenex boxes which come very handy when the weather is freezing outside.
The heated floor omg!!! Amazing .
We will be coming back !
Location: close to many restaurants, grocery stores and many things to do around the area with in minutes.
We traveled with 2 kids 5 and 8
We visited the cheese farm ? Kids loved !!! Hanging out with the cows and see with their own eyes farm to table milk process.
We also visited the crater in homestead, took a train tour by the lake , had lunch ate the cafe galleria in Midway.
20 minutes from Park city and 38 from salt lake .
So if you like to explore, Mariah’s places is the perfect spot to stay."

Mariah has added touches that made the stay feel high end - plenty of spices in the kitchen, decent cooking utensils, quality linens, fresh robes, shampoo, conditioner, & body wash in the shower, cozy throw blanket for the couch, easy outlets for phone charging.
Other reviews made me a little nervous so I’ll add the bed was slightly more firm than my purple mattress. We slept great! And the sound proofing of the house is great! We heard very little from upstairs except a few muffled running steps of their toddler during the day.
I was able to get a 90 min massage from Mariah during my stay. I would highly recommend it! Her rates are a steal. She was communicative ahead of time about logistics and arrived on time. Her easy manner put me right at ease. She varied the pressure to my needs and incorporated these beautiful extras that made it feel very spa like (aromatherapy, heated table, hot stones, and even a hot towel for my feet!)"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay at Mariah’s place. Everything was brand new and spotless. Mariah had detailed information for us at a table by the front door. It was so nice to have everything laid out for us so that all of our questions were answered right there. The place had lots of little extras that I enjoyed. My favorite was walking into the bathroom and finding that the floor was heated. Being from Arizona that’s not something we experience. It was so nice and toasty. I also loved the bamboo wash cloths that were provided for taking off your make up. It felt like we were at a spa. In fact, I have ordered some for myself now at home.
Mariah was great to communicate with us when we had questions. I loved that she let us know about a local festival happening in town that weekend. We attended the festival and had a great time.
We enjoyed our little home away from home for the weekend. We liked hanging out and just playing games and being together. Amazing weekend. We’ll return!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay with Mariah was fantastic! We loved the beautiful new, clean space she created which had a very spa-like atmosphere and was very soothing and calming to be in. The kitchen has all new appliances and had everything we needed to prepare meals during our stay. The bathroom is functional, elegant and warmed with heat lamps and the added surprise comfort of radiant heated floors! My friend, who stayed in the bedroom, repeatedly commented on how comfortable the bed was and the pull out couch in the living room provided both a large comfortable sleeping area for me and a nice place to watch movies with my friends. Communication with Mariah was friendly, prompt and accommodating in all instances. The two friends who shared this space with me during this visit both asked me for Mariah's contact information for future visits to Heber for other friends and family. Mariah is also a massage therapist and offers massage by appointment to those who would like that. While I didn't have time to take advantage of this, this option is definitely an added plus to staying in this space. After thoroughly searching for AirBnB accommodations in Heber City, the value for the price is also second to none. There is no need to search for a better place to stay in Heber, you've already found it!"

That is a very nice extra offering to guests! There were plenty of towels. Great parking and we loved the view from the balcony! However, the road noise is quite loud but couldn't hear it from inside. The smart thermostat is easy to navigate but only allowed to turn down to 69 and only for 3 hours before it returned to the default 72 so I woke up hot to reset it. It should be noted that this condo is on the 3rd floor and it's 1 mile plus walk to main street so I wouldn't consider this location walkable. Great hosts, very responsive with clear check-in and out instructions. Overall, great property!"

The ONLY thing I would say is read all of the details about the basement. There is not a separate door to lock or shut to separate the owners living upstairs, it was only separated by a curtain. It felt a little weird to us. Again I definitely didn’t read that there wasn’t a door and only a curtain for a door (until we got there) so just make sure to read all of the descriptions. Just with 3 woman we felt a little unsafe knowing anyone could come downstairs and we didn’t have a door or anything. But if you don’t care about that then it’s totally fine! The space really was nice and big and the beds were super comfortable!"

Stayed one night",Last minute getaway and we lucked out by finding this place. Lots of room and spacious. We enjoyed the pool table and ping pong table and basketball game (balls need a little inflating😉). Lovely tub with jets and great shower pressure. Comfy bed and we brought things to cook for dinner and breakfast. Great little kitchen…a can opener would have been helpful but maybe we just overlooked it. Love sac chair was super comfy to watch tv. Would have been a little more comfortable with a door to the upstairs but it wasn’t a big deal. All in all a lovely relaxing stay! Would definitely book again!

Stayed a few nights","We spent several days at Ross’s place and would definitely recommend it.
The entire place was comfortable, and inviting. Check in was easy and effortless.
I am personally someone who doesn’t feel comfortable staying at my friend’s house, much less a complete stranger, but I was completely comfortable at this rental.
The pool table was fun, and utilized. Coffee pot was small enough to please the coffee drinkers in our group, but not large enough to waste coffee.
I really liked having the fridge with the built in ice maker, and water.
The rooms were very spacious, and the single bathroom was perfect. Someone could take a shower while someone else was using the sink area, and it wasn’t an inconvenience.
Great place to lay your head while exploring the area."

It is a great place for families or people with several guests. The basement mother-in-law suite was clean, spacious, new, fresh, upscale, and made me feel right at home (I like nice places). I would HIGHLY recommend this property. Even though it is in Heber City, I found it easy to drive to Park City for skiing. The surrounding community is quaint and friendly. Overall, I highly recommend this property and would stay here again if my travels bring me to the Park City area! Thank you, Ross!!!"

Other than that, everything was great and we really enjoyed the space. We would stay here again."

My partner was hesitant to book via Airbnb over a hotel, let alone share a house, but he and the kids have been raving about it ever since we left. The amount of thought which went into making our stay comfortable meant so much, and honestly the space was so spacious and private.
If ever we are in the Heber City area again, we will look Ross up to see if we can stay at his home again.
Highly, highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Enjoyed our stay here, just wish we were able to be in town longer and really enjoy it more as it had such a great setup. The space has a great layout, beautifully clean and very comfortable - king size beds were a bonus I was not expecting. Ross was also so accommodating with our mountain bikes being safely stored & replied promptly to messages. The neighborhood was easy to navigate (maps took me right there). It was a little difficult to find the house itself as it was dark & not many street lights, but that’s on me because we arrived much later than planned & I have terrible night vision. It was much easier in the morning light to easily see the house and numbers. Would most definitely stay here again next time we come up to Heber City."

Our 3-year-old also loved the space under the stairs with toys and a little guitar. Ross was very responsive when we had things come up. Fireplace isn’t currently working and the kitchen faucet was a little tricky as the handle is broken. Neither was a big deal to us. Before coming, I was worried about how private it would be. But it felt very separate once we were downstairs. The host was respectful of keeping the space private. Thanks for a fun trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Last year, we rented an Airbnb in SLC (which was great), but this trip we were doing winter activities (x-country skiing and snowmobiling) both southeast of SLC, and booked Ross's place in Heber. Pictures and descriptions looked too good to be true, but ALL WAS SPOT ON! The full kitchen, comfy leather sectional, large smart TV's in all rooms, pool table, comfy king beds, large bathroom with good water pressure were as described and amazing. While there, we took ski lessons at the Soldiers Hollow Nordic Center, snowmobiled out at Daniels Summit Lodge, and took two trips to Park City, and all were super easy to get to and only 20-25 minutes away. I absolutley would recommend Ross's Airbnb, and hopefully it is available the next time we visit the Beehive State!"

I’m not sure if the description was updated after I booked or not, but I didn’t realize that there is no separation from the rest of the house from the basement. It has two bedrooms, and one of them is difficult to lock because it connects to the bathroom and has a children’s playroom/ wall cut out that leads to the rest of the house. That is the only reason I gave 4 stars, because I would prefer rooms that can easily be secured, but everything else was clean, had lots of activities, and the host was very responsive."

Going in the side door and down the stairs was super easy and once downstairs, it felt like a totally separate space. Never heard anyone upstairs. Very private. Felt comfortable & like home. Would stay again."

The neighborhood felt very safe and clean as well and we enjoyed jogging around this beautiful town early in the morning. Ross and his wife were very kind and always available to help.

But if you are able to go up and down several stairs, the location is beautiful; the basement is incredibly spacious; the beds are quite comfortable and it’s a bonus that there is an additional floor mattress. We had fun with the basketball game. It was also extremely clean.
Overall, the feeling of this airBnB is luxuriously comfortable. I’d definitely stay again."

I was a little worried about noise but they must have extra insulation because we barely heard anything and hopefully they didn't hear my noisy kids too much.

My mom has a hard time with long drives and we discovered that there wasn't a good place for her to sit that provided good lumbar back support (the couch was too soft and the chairs at the table too hard...sounds like a famous fable, I know), but she found a solution.

Stayed one night","Our trip was kind of last minute, and I’m so thankful Ana’s place was available so we didn’t have to travel home from a dance competition in the snow. The house was cozy and welcoming, and exactly as described. I was happy that when we got there and when we left the sidewalks were cleared for us, and bonus…the snow was removed from my car. Extra blankets were easy to find and the couch set up was great for relaxing hand chatting. We went to Dairy Keen for dinner and their sweet potato fries were delicious. If we do this dance competition again I will for sure stay here again."

We found a few additions in the kitchen would be helpful and Ana expressed a willingness to get what we needed. For those where the backyard being fenced is important, know it’s not fenced all the way around. It didn’t impact us, but is good to know. Much appreciated them taking pets!"

The cottage is really cute and comfortable with everything we needed. We cooked several meals in and also walked to restaurants and the grocery store that were nearby. I left a few personal items behind on accident and received a massage from Dustin letting me know before I even realized I had left them.
We would definitely stay here again if back in town!"

The bed is SUPER COMFORTABLE, the decor is cozy and tasteful, the kitchen has everything you would need. The cottage is 20 minutes from Sundance Ski Resort and 25 minutes from Park City, making a ski trip super easy when you want to ski, but far enough that you are not bombarded by crowds. Heber City is cute, with a great local market, coffee shops and restaurants. Dustin was very friendly, helpful, and communicative. If you are looking for a cozy cottage retreat, look no further. We can't wait to come back!"

We used the kitchen nearly every night and there was actual nice cookware (not just the cheapest items from ikea present in many airbnbs) as well as spices. Heber City is an established town with many shops and grocery stores, yet the cottage is on a residential street that was very quiet at night. Best of all are the hosts, who are kind, responsive, and live right next door—we felt like we were visiting extended family! Skiing at Park City was an easy 20 minute drive. Recommended!"

Stayed with kids","This is the second time we’ve stayed at Jace’s Chick’s Cafe Loft. It’s such a cute little place. There are 2 bedrooms and one bathroom. Laundry services on site. Two couches in the living area that fold down into beds. We try to do a little wintery “staycation” every January/February, and Jace’s place is perfect for this. We’re from Cottonwood Heights, so we’re about a 45 minute drive away. This location is right in the middle of all the the awesome things you can do in the Heber valley. We went to the Ice Castles, swam in the Homestead Crater, toured a dairy farm, rode the Heber Creeper train, and ate pizza at Cafe Galleria in an alpenglobe. This is just an awesome place. The kids beg to come here. Your stay also includes a $20 voucher to eat at Chick’s Cafe. We just have so much fun every time we stay here! 10/10. Will stay again."

Stayed with kids","Great little loft on the heart of Main Street in Heber. Close to many fun winter attractions. Space was clean overall and had nice amenities.
The queen beds are quite firm and I personally didn’t sleep great on them. Because the loft is over a restaurant, we did hear some noise in the middle of the night the second night we stayed there, with what we assumed some maintenance work on something on the roof. Other than that, it was more quiet than I thought it would be with it being right on the busy road. We enjoyed our stay and it was a new looking, fully furnished place for the price."

Jace and Jordan were very responsive, kind, and all around a dream to do work. Everything I'm coming to the Park City area, they will be my first pick if available!"

Living space was clean and comfortable, able to sleep 4 to 6 people comfortably. Only downside was that there was only 1 bathroom, and the water pressure fluctuates throughout the day due to the restaurant below."

The location was wonderful. We chose Heber City out of the blue to spend the month of August. We were not disappointed with the Heber Valley OR the Airbnb we chose.
Very central to everything in Heber City/Midway/Park City/Provo.
We contacted Jace twice during the month and he responded w/ in an hour or two both times.
We plan on returning for a summer month next year.
We only gave it 5 stars because there aren’t more to give.

Stayed with kids","This place is absolutely stunning! It was perfect for our family of six, with kids ranging in age from 4 to 14. It is VERY clean. We personally loved the location. The kitchen is well stocked and there are plenty of towels and extra linens.
There were a couple of complaints from others reviews that I thought may have been potential issues, but they seem to have been addressed or resolved before we arrived. The first one was that people mention that it was very noisy because it’s on Main street. That may be the case but it was not a deterrent at all for our young family. There is a white noise machine that we used for our kids and everything was just fine. We really did not notice the street noise at all.
Also someone had mentioned that the stairway up to the unit is very dark. Actually, it is very well lit. There is a light switch at the bottom and then another one at the top inside the unit, so lighting was not an issue at all.
Jace and Jordan are great hosts!"

It was just my son and I, but we could easily fit our family of five, and still not feel cramped! Clean, decorated perfectly, comfortable beds, and centrally located! We will be back!"

Other reviews mention the road noise and trucks but frankly if you ask our three year old son the variety of trucks to spot on the road was a real asset. He spent hours in the window calling out what he saw. The apartment is very well furnished and laid out. The restaurant was nice enough to let us borrow a child’s seat when we needed it. We loved our stay and Heber City. It’s a quaint friendly town that you can tell booms with community and personality.

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely home if you are deaf you are literally on top of a freeway with trucks going by 24 seven the noise is overwhelming if you’d like to sleep this is not a good place to stay if you wanna come and enjoy a beautiful appointed noisy apartment this is for you I have been staying in Airbnb’s for many years I have never had someone not disclose how much noise is coming from the street.
Also a little issue with security is they literally leave the doors to the street hallway entrance to the unit unlocked I absolutely was locked out one late evening because a roofer decided to lock the door not acceptable.
I would’ve absolutely given this home five stars if they could pick up the unit and move it to somewhere where there’s zero noise or even a little bit of noise but not something overwhelming when you had to wear earplugs to hear yourself think good luck"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed for 3 nights. Great stay!! Perfect location for seeing the area!! We hiked a local state park and drove the incredibly scenic Mirror Lake Hwy and Guardsman Pass. Park City is 20-minute drive. The included meal voucher was perfect for a delicious and filling breakfast for 2 at Chick's Cafe. Melvin's is a short walk and was a friendly stop for a beer and appetizer. Heber Valley Brewing was a nice stop as well, less than a 15 minute walk up Main St. We can also recommend Bagel Den for breakfast. Back 40 Ranch House Grill had great food, service and views for our 31st wedding anniversary dinner.
About the host and space: the host was great and provided everything we needed for our stay. Communication was great. Check-in was easy (tip: if the stairway is dark on the way up to the loft, there is a light switch at the bottom of the stairs). We had a few questions after check-in, and Jordan responded almost immediately. There is plenty of free street parking or you can park around back. Plenty of K-Cups were provided for the coffee maker. The space is exactly as shown in the pictures, clean, comfy, and nicely renovated (note: there is no dishwasher, which didn't bother us).
Final notes: There are 19 steps from the street to the loft. That's OK with us but could be a consideration for others. The water pressure was a non-issue. The periods of low pressure last less than 30 seconds, but it's good to know about it in advance so no surprises. Also, Main Street is a 4-lane highway through town. You will hear it in the front living space, but not from the rear bedrooms."

Stayed with kids","Great location for our vacation covering lots of locations in Heber, Park City, Deer Creek Reservoir, and Midway. Everything was close by, and there was lots of great food in the area, including the cafe downstairs that we stopped at twice.
The hosts are fabulous and very attentive to any needs. I'd definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","If you have read the reviews, we have established that the water pressure going in and out is annoying. That being said, I would stay here over and over again. Darling décor, very clean, has everything you need, and it's the perfect size! The meal voucher that comes with your stay is the best ""hotel breakfast"" you'll find! My son and I stayed here for our final three nights, of our ten day golf tournament trip, and it was the perfect place to end! It is SO much better than staying at a hotel. Although the Loft sits on the busiest streets in Heber, the bedrooms are at the back of the loft, and my son and I both slept fine and the road noise wasn't an issue at all! The hosts were great, friendly, and communicated well before, during, and after our stay."

Stayed a few nights","The Loft was perfect for my wife and I for our quick trip to Utah for a wedding in Midway. Check-in was as easy as it gets and Jordan communicated well and was very responsive. The place was very clean and comfortable. We wanted something that didn’t feel like a hotel and this place fits that perfectly. As many have mentioned, the sound from the traffic on Main Street was noticeable, but really dies down after 11pm or so. We both had to laugh as we tried to take showers mid-day to get ready for the wedding. Unfortunately, we timed it perfectly with the Cafe running their dishwasher which literally took all the water pressure away from the shower. There are several signs warning us this could happen so we were not surprised. Chick’s Cafe breakfast was very good. Thanks for providing the great space. If we are ever back in the area, we will stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in the loft checking in on a Saturday and checking out on a Tuesday. Check in instructions were easy to follow. I was worried with this being right above the cafe that it might smell like a fryer/ the restaurant below. It does smell like the restaurant in the hallway leading up to the loft and a bit inside the loft. The smell, while noticeable, wasn't terrible to begin with but if it's too much for you they also have one of the wax warmers in the loft to combat the smell. In our 4 day stay we only used it twice. The location right on main street is easy to get to, and central to other activities. Parking was rarely an issue. However, the loft is on mainstreet and it sounds like it's right on main street. You can hear the traffic from the street and them setting up in the morning at the restaurant throughout the loft so if noise is an issue for you when you sleep you would want to bring ear plugs. They have a nice TV in the loft which we were able to hook our Xbox to. I think the TV is a smart TV that comes equipped with the streaming apps that you can log into. They have a washer and dryer in the loft and also provider detergent. We brought our own shampoo and conditioner because I have very long thick hair and the tiny bottles aren't enough for me. However, they had full sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner so you can save the space in your luggage. They have hangars in the closet so you can take your close out of your bag and air them out. They also have a guide to Heber city which was super helpful! Overall we enjoyed our stay and the meal voucher was a nice plus and a great way to finish out our trip. The $20 voucher is given to you at the beginning and can be used anytime during your stay. We just chose to use it as our last hurrah and it provided for an excellent breakfast."

Stayed a few nights",This place i would give 5 stars on everything. It's in a historic building downtown but newly renovated upstairs loft. Perfect location in the central business district downtown. You can pretty much walk to any place in town. Perfect neighborhoods to walk in and close to the park. You can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommended !

Stayed over a week",We stayed for 4 weeks and the loft was a perfect place to stay so that we could ski at four different mountains. The loft gets great light and there are great views of the mountains once you're on Main St. Multiple restaurants to choose from within walking distance. We ate at Chick's Cafe each week. In-unit laundry was so convenient. The loft was beautifully renovated and feels very comfortable. Jordan was so quick and easy to communicate with. He bought an iron and ironing board for the loft when I asked if I could borrow one from him. We loved our time at the loft and would happily stay here again.

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for a month and would definitely go back. The space was really large and well designed/laid out. The ceilings are pretty high and there were a lot of windows so it was bright and airy. Internet speed was great. It was on a main road, but I never had a problem with noise - the bedrooms are all in the back and it was extremely quiet. The location was good too - lots of hiking trails around and a short drive to park city and deer valley. I also went to snowbird, Alta and solitude while there and none were that far away. If you go to deer valley there is a gondola about ten minutes down the road which takes you over the hill and onto the mountain. Very friendly and helpful hosts too."

Some quirks - at times water pressure so low that you had to wait to wash your hands and kitchen a bit sparsely equipped if you do a lot of cooking. Overall we loved our weekend and would rent again.

Stayed a few nights","The place was extremely clean, parking was easy, and great access to the ski areas. Only a 20 minute drive to Park City and 10 minutes from the Deer Valley gondola. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, and a grocery store within walking distance. The only negative comments I have is the apartment is located on a busy road with a lot of road noise so any guests sleeping on the pullout sofas may have a hard time sleeping with the noise. The bedrooms are on the backside so road noise isn't an issue. Also there are some water pressure issues in the shower from the Cafe below but it's manageable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this loft apartment."

It’s right on the Main Street in Heber making it convenient. We were able to make meals with the kitchen and even went down to the cafe. Great hosts to work with by responding quickly.
