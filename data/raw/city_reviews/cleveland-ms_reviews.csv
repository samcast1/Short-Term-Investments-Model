Stayed a few nights","The hosts were very welcoming and helpful. Accommodations were very clean, bed was very comfortable and water pressure in shower was great!
Very convenient to Delta State University. The added bonus was making a new furry friend…Biscuit was super cute and very loving. We would stay here again without a second thought."

The guest house is detached and it felt like our own little home. Very comfortable!
We hope to make this our ""go to"" place every time we're in town!

Stayed a few nights","My dad was recently placed in a nursing home in Cleveland, I knew nothing of the area as I live out of state. I was very hesitant to book an Airbnb but figured if it ended up not working I would just get a hotel. When arriving at the location I was thrilled. It is in a beautiful neighborhood, I felt very safe, and the host Scott was extremely friendly and responsive! We had a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights",This was my second stay. I came back because I had a great experience the first time! When I pulled up to the guest house it was nicely decorated for Christmas on the outside. The place is cute to begin with but the decorations really made me feel at home! He also had in his yard the largest blow up snowman I had ever seen. I was in town to spend Christmas with my family. The place has been clean and organized each time I’ve stayed. Scott is the nicest host you could ever have. I enjoyed my time there. And I’m sure I will have many future stays!

Stayed with kids","While this place was a great deal for the area, there are several things that could make this space much better. The place was what I like to call “surface clean”.. all the visible items were clean but all the rest not so much. Ceiling fans and baseboards needed dusting, the plates all needed to be rewashed, and the dog smell was the worst. If you have a pet allergy this is not the space for you. Additionally, the outside space while very nice lacked privacy. There was not much separation from the main house, this could cause some privacy issues but we experienced none."

Stayed with a pet","This is my second stay at Scott’s place, and it won’t be my last. This little place is the perfect size for one or two people, is clean and comfortable, and is located in a beautiful and safe neighborhood that is convenient to all that Cleveland has to offer. It is also pet friendly, which is a plus for us. As the neighborhood is excellent, if you are a walker, it is the perfect place to get in your steps (mornings here are quiet and gorgeous). If you want to see some of Cleveland’s sights, it’s a quick drive to the Grammy Museum, downtown, the college, and most any other great spot. The guesthouse has the feel of a little cottage and is well appointed. When we didn’t go out to one of Cleveland’s great restaurants, we could easily prepare meals here. The linens were soft and luxurious, and the bed was super comfy. If you want a comfortable, cozy, elegant, yet laid-back stay, this is the place. Thanks Scott and family, we enjoyed our stay, and we will be back, soon!"

I'm actually reluctant to advertise Scott's place because I need it for next year! Lol Netflix and other popular streaming options. The king bed is super soft...forgot where I was. Thank you!

I spent a good part of my day at a flea market called ""moonstruck""....there was so much to look at and i loved it all...The owner and his daughter were very friendly.
The space itself is perfect for a couple. We brought our dog along and she managed fine while we were out around town. We never saw the owners of the house, but we did meet their dogs. :)
We went to the Cotton House hotel downtown for the evening and went to their rooftop bar, ""La Fontaine""....very delta chic. We came down to the ground floor after drinks and ate at the Delta Meat Market. We had a lovely stay in Cleveland. Thanks!"

Stayed about a week","This was a lovely place to stay. I used it as temporary housing while I found a permanent place to live, and it was perfect. All the furniture was unbelievably comfortable; I couldn't wait to go to bed just so I could snuggle up under the covers on the memory foam mattress! The closet was large enough for me to hang up my dresses. The kitchen was more than adequate for a short stay. Microwave, fridge, oven, and sink. Check-in was SO easy and I could come and go as I pleased very easily. Since it's a guest house I could also have things delivered. There is plenty of driveway parking. The living room is cozy and has blankets and a TV with a Roku device (the bedroom has one as well). There is a separate AC system so I could turn the heat on or off as I liked. Bathroom was cute and had decent amenities; there is a hotel-style hairdryer in the closet and a removable shower head in the shower. Everything was clean! Overall it was an excellent place to live for a few days and I will happily recommend it to anyone who wants to visit this area."

What I love most was the fact she would reach out and asked if I needed anything or was everything ok. I loved my suite, it has a at home country vibe and very peaceful. Nice ,safe and quiet neighborhood."

Stayed with kids","Shelby said me and my four year old girl were her first AirBnB guests, but you wouldn't know it! This little guest house was perfect for us: private, separate from the main house entirely, had all the amenities we needed, and was super comfortable for our stay. The Grammy Museum and Delta State are very nearby; we did touristy things and didn't take of advantage of the offer to drive around in Shelby's golf cart, but the surrounding neighborhood was a beautiful, safe place to just walk and take in the fall air. Shelby added personal touches to our stay; you can tell she cared that we were comfortable from the moment we stepped in the door. I wish her all the best and hope to stay there again!"

First and foremost, though, Amonzo interacted with me in a most friendly manner, like I was not just someone to whom he was renting his space, but a real person he might even enjoy meeting someday."

We honestly didn’t spend much time in the apartment other than to sleep as we were attending a weekend sporting event that took up most of our time. The bed I slept in was comfortable.
Although we did not have to contact Amonzo with any problems or issues, all of his responses in the rental process were timely. After we’d checked in he contacted us to make sure we didn’t need anything and to assure us that if anything came up we could contact him."

Also, I recommended double checking to see if the hot tub is working before your stay (it was not working during our stay). Beyond that, everything is about what you would expect from the listing. The house was very spacious and clean. The neighborhood is nice. The location is close to the grocery store and restaurants."

It was spacious, well equipped, and immaculately clean. The size and set up allowed us to be together, but also to have personal space. There was plenty of space for parking and lots of outdoor seating as well. The home was stocked with extras that are not always available in an Airbnb-toiletries, extra paper products. Perhaps the most amazing part of this stay was the kindness, communication, and understanding of the host. Even when I messaged late one night, she responded promptly and answered my question. This was not a vacation for us, but this home and host made a trying time a little easier for my family and we are grateful for that."

My family and I traveled down from Chicago as a large group to attend a funeral just North in Clarksdale. The home turned out to be the perfect fit for us all! Even I was taken by surprise upon entry! BEAUTIFUL home! Great location within town, extremely spacious & clean and it has all the amenities any number of people could need. It was truly a home away from home, just be respectful of the household and their rules and you will love your stay here! I'd like to give a moment of appreciation to Tashandra, the host, who was so so very attentive, kind and gracious from the moment I first contacted her regarding our interest in staying until the time that we made our way back home. I can't thank her enough for her superb hospitality especially during a time when we needed it the most. Her character alone made it all worth it! My family and I are definitely looking forward to staying here again! ❤"

Group trip","Our stay in the home was amazing.!
The house is well decorated and served us well as a place that offered great sleeping accommodations and a place of comfort and fellowship for many family members after formal activities of our family reunion. Although we did not exercise pool privileges the pool area is beautiful and served as private get away area for small groups of the family who had not seen each other in years to reconnect. Some of us used the area as a quiet area to reflect and meditate.
The layout of the house. is smart and included several private spaces that allowed multiple couples to experience their own private quarters while creating large beautiful space for family fellowship. The master bedroom is huge and fit for any king and/or queen.
The workout room offers equipment for anyone who wills to work off the calories from all the tasty southern food.
My family found the house to be well organized and beautiful, yet comfortable and a great value."

There are 2 bedrooms down and 5 individual beds/spaces in a large shared room upstairs. So it’s great for a situation where adults want to stay downstairs in privacy and let kids all stay upstairs. Or a guys trip where several people can stay in a shared common space upstairs. The den and living area and kitchen are perfect for a large group to meet and spend time together. Plenty of parking and walkable to everything in downtown Cleveland and Delta State University.

Stayed a few nights","Griz-Acre is located on an acre of land with a spacious house, and yard in the most desirable place to be in Cleveland. It is close to everywhere you might want to go. I was here with a group of artist, but I can imagine it being a great family space with plenty of room to gather.
It is different in that the two main downstair rooms, (one room King Bed with bath, and one room with Queen bed and bath in the hall) and single beds upstairs (some in their own private nooks) can house a large number of people, not including spacious sofas in a large family room with a 1/2 bathroom. The house is ready for company and it is very comfortable. I just left today but know I will go back again. It is very clean and the beds were comfortable, sheets and towels were top rate. It has more room than you can possibly need. Our group loved it and we will return."

Group trip","The house had not been cleaned in a while, which was evident in the amount of dead bugs that we around the house and some residual trash under some of the couches. There were also some live bugs found in the house that we had to kill. I made several attempts to contact them about the door latch because the door did not close. Even after you sent someone to ""fix"" it, the door was open when we arrived back to the house that evening - showing that they were unable to close it themselves. We had to use a chair to keep the back door closed for the entirety of our stay. Coming down to Mississippi for a funeral was already stressful, but a further burden was placed on us by having to deal with anxiety around the possibility of someone being in the house when we returned or that someone may have gotten into the home during our time away and stealing our things or other things in the house (which is absolutely beautiful and full of antique pieces). Also, with the exception of the back door, all other doors to the house were locked and we found no key to open them. I believe this is a fire safety violation due to a lack of egress. I understand that you are busy like the rest of us, but your limited response to us around such an important issue was disconcerting."

Kitchen was very sparse - no coffee mugs (but had a Keurig), limited silverware (only 1 butter knife, no steak knives, maybe 5 forks and spoons, no toaster, very few pots/pans, no strainer or cutting board). We like to use Airbnb rather than hotels so we don’t have to go out to eat.
Other than the lack of kitchen items the house was perfect and would highly recommend. Great location. Plenty of space. I would definitely stay there again.
The only other thing to note (I wouldn’t take a star off for it…just an fyi), one bathroom only has a bathtub (no shower). The other bathroom does have a shower."

Stayed with kids","The house needs a lot of maintenance work. Hole in wall in dining room. Doors don't open and close properly. Oven didn’t work. Spent money to cook for 7 people, and after 2 hours in the oven, it was still frozen . I had to have food delivered costing over $120. The jacuzzi tub would not hold water for long. The refrigerator was nasty from liquids leaking in the door. I had to wipe down the outside handles and door because it was dirty from food and fingerprints. The gas fireplace didn't work. There was a dirty k-cup in the coffee maker. The cups in the cupboard were dirty. Had to buy paper towels. There were no extra blankets, and the ones on the bed were very thin. The washing machine kept showing door open and wouldn't finish the load of laundry. It could be a very nice place but needs a lot of maintenance work."

One thing to note which probably wouldn’t affect the majority of people staying, but we love to cook our own meals and there wasn’t a lot of amenities in the kitchen, but we made do."

I must say the photos do not do it justice. The land is very peaceful and picturesque. We enjoyed the quiet and listening to the cicadas. We also enjoyed the rain on the tin roof while swinging on the screened in porch.
The space is just beautiful and very clean. We loved the decor and cozy beds.
The pool was so nice too! Lars even provided us with beach towels! It was cool to watch the horses while we swam!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to visit again. This place is a real gem. Best kept secret in my opinion!"

The Sycamore Cottage was just what we needed for our party of 6 - comfortable to sleep and hang out, but centrally located for us to tour around The Delta. The setting was lovely, and we were able to enjoy the pool a few times as well. The favorite spot was the screened porch, and we had to take turns lounging on the bed swings. That was the spot for morning coffee, reading a good book, afternoon naps, and evening chats."

Lars was so friendly and welcoming, he even gave us a tour of his farm. We would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Delta."

I believe after this review that Brandon will add some small stuff to the kitchen.

There was a solid layer of dust on many surfaces, the base boards, doors, vents and blinds all had dirt and grim. It was stated in the house description that coffee was provided but there was no coffee to be found in the house but two coffee makers which was quite frustrating to wake up to. Over all we were expecting the house to be a bit more updated and taken by surprise by the dated poorly working faucets and disruptively noisy air conditioner. The kitchen tap would only provide warm to hot water and the faucet handle was very loose. There are a few more things we could nit pick but over all the house was not as expected."

Very cute little house, I definitely recommend this place! We did not even use the third bedroom with the bunk beds. Would be great for 2 couples with a couple kids for sure!! Nice neighborhood and close to stores and some landmark things to see!"

Stayed one night","Holy cow…this place is perfect! First of all, the communication with the host is second to none. I was traveling solo on this trip to Cleveland but the Rail Car would be great for a couple or even a small family. It was a somewhat rainy/dreary weekend but the screened in porch was awesome for morning coffee and I could see it being a cool place to unwind in the evening as well.
Amenities were great. Roku TV, WiFi, coffee maker, and comfy accommodations. I have enjoyed this place so much it makes we want to take a shot and start my own tiny house in my hometown for guest visiting the area.
Location is so close to DSU which is a bonus for me as I was in town to broadcast baseball games against DSU (Go Tigers…U West Alabama). Actually, I’m typically here 2-3 times a year to broadcast other sports and this will be my go-to from now on.
There is nothing not to like about this place. Seriously, stop reading this review and book the place before you miss out!"

The location of the place is great and it really could be a nice little option if you’re passing through. Susan was easy to communicate with during check in and check out . Unfortunately, within the first hour of staying there, we saw three cockroaches, one which was on the bed. This kind of freaked us out and we did not sleep well. Another reason we did not sleep well is that the mattress was caving in- in the center of the bed - and was just about as uncomfortable as it could possibly be. My husband ended up going out to the couch for the second half of the night. For these reasons, we were glad that we had only just one night here."

Stayed a few nights","The word bucolic came to mind when I drove up to the Peacock Cottage.
For me this was like stepping back in time. I grew up in the Mississippi Delta not so many miles from Peacock in the Delta. The Delta has changed so much from my 1960s childhood, so much of the land has been cleared of trees to make room for crops, so much of the crop land leveled to facilitate irrigation, YET this farm has been kept pristine, as I said, for me, literally like walking back in time.
The host, Lars, a quintessential Delta character, was a perfect host.
Oh yea, I was traveling solo, without my dogs, and Lars even arranged for the family Bernedoodle to greet me at my door each morning. Then there are also horses, pigs etc. which may come up to the back fence, just beyond the cottage, to speak.
The stay was more than a stay, it was an experience."

The location was perfect to go to the surrounding towns to get to a few attractions like the BB King museum. But the farm itself was the best place to be. Lars was warm and receptive. The cottage is cute and comfy. The porches allowed for coffee and breakfast in the mornings and every morning the puppers, Levi and River came to saw hi. There are beautiful horses and sheep and a huge piggy Lucky. Archie took us horseback riding through the farm and even showed us his carriage horses. We loved our stay at the Peacock and will be back soon."

We met Lars and he was super friendly and interesting. I would love to come back when we have more time, as there was much more to see and do on the farm than our brief visit allowed. We were in the Delta to visit civil rights and music history sites, and we did get lessons in those that we will never forget."

We loved the dogs Levi and River - they became constant companions.
We really enjoyed chatting to Lars who showed us around the farm and was really interesting to speak to. The cabin is in an ideal location for exploring the many Blues attractions in the surrounding area, and of course the Kermit Museum in Leland. Highly recommend."

It is clean, we'll kept, well appointed, and romantic. A big plus is all the animals on the farm (especially Levi the dog). Without a doubt, this is the best AirBnb we've ever experienced."

I did a little walking with Lars' dogs around the property, but it was a warm weekend, so I mostly just hung out on the screened porch or in the hammock. I was visiting by myself this time and felt totally safe. It's the perfect place for a getaway either with a friend or partner or on your own!

Every aspect of this stay was 5 stars from Lars communication, hospitality, and the charm of the cottage and property. The small touches such as providing coffee, sugar, and cream was great. Lars even allowed for my entire family to go horse back riding which was the most amazing experience. My 4 year old has not stopped talking about this trip yet and fell in love with Lars dog Rider. We will be back later this year and would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone. Lars, Kay, and Louisa treated us like family.

No road noise, just nature at its finest. The cottage did tend to stay a little on the warm side bc of all the windows but all those windows also provided stunning views!
We were fortunate enough to have a small rain shower right at lunch & we loved picnicking on the screened in porch. It was perfect!
Every morning we enjoyed coffee & Bible study time on the porch and then walked right out the door to the pool. It was fabulous!
Levi, (the bernadoodle) was super friendly
and was the perfect tour companion as we walked around the property.
Lars was gracious and available but not overbearing. The cottage was closer to their home than I had realized but we still had plenty of privacy.
We brought most of our own groceries but did enjoy a delicious meal at NOLA and at lost pizza.
If you want to sleep in you might want to bring a sleep mask because the cottage does have lots of natural light ☺️
We look forward to returning in cooler temps to take advantage of the fire pit! Our time went too quickly and we look forward to coming again."

We've stayed in many, many Airbnb's, nearly all of them good to great, and this one is our family favorite. The cottage is even more beautiful in person, and those beds, whoa, we slept like babies. The land is just gorgeous. What really makes this place, though, much as with any place, is the people: our hosts were so gracious and welcoming that we just immediately felt at ease. There's much to do onsite and it's a great base for exploring the delta, but the best thing is to just sit on one of the two porches and do nothing at all :) (really). Highly recommend.
Ps: Great shower. Kitchen has everything you'd need. Yard with fire pit is another bonus."

Stayed a few nights","This spot is magical! The cabin may be small, but I can't think of a thing that would improve it. My husband and I enjoyed a short getaway, but I could also imagine coming here for a solo retreat or even a cozy stay with the kids. (Though they're about to list a new, larger cabin on the same property, so we'd probably stay there if they came.) The weather in mid-November was unseasonably warm, so we got to play games on the screened porch and read on the front porch that overlooks the horse pasture. We took long walks around the property and saw deer and an owl. Even Lars' and Cay's dogs were hospitable, welcoming us as soon as we pulled up and accompanying us on our walks.
You could certainly stay on the property your whole visit without getting bored. There's tennis, basketball, horseback riding, and even a lovely pool in season. But we took a drive to Cleveland one night and ate dinner on the patio at Hey Joe's (which felt safe because of the open air, even during Covid) and then took a long stroll through the impressive downtown Christmas light display. The next day, we drove over to Greenville for a catfish sandwich at Gino's (thanks to the recommendation of a previous reviewer!), a peaceful walk through the Greenville Cypress Preserve, a drive to Warfield Point Park to see the Mississippi River, and finally a stop by Winterville Mounds to see some of the largest remaining mounds constructed by indigenous people a thousand years ago.
All in all, it was a fantastic getaway and I'm trying to figure out how soon I can get back!"

If you want to get away and unwind this is the spot. Read a book, play a game, nap or whatever you enjoy! We plan to return. The cottage is plenty spacious.

While Lars and family are nearby, the space feels entirely yours, but Lars is quick to respond to messages if needed.

Be sure to ask for Archie’s number for horseback riding around the property, he’s got a wealth of knowledge and plenty of good jokes to share. Nearby are several good restaurants and bars (with safe distancing during pandemic), including Hey Joe’s in Cleveland which seems to have the most affordable craft beer in the world and Gino’s, a drive through with one of the best catfish sandwich I’ve ever had. We can’t wait to come back."

For me, Lars is a man of independence, intellectual and full of curiosity and challenge, like Clint Eastwood. At the same time, Cay is a thoughtful, bright lady with a philosophical mindset like Susan Sontag. And both of them have warm hospitality.
My gut feeling is saying that this experience in the Tennessee Delta will bring me something unforeseen to my future life. I will return here someday. Let's keep diving ""into the unknown"" until then!"

My husband and I enjoyed ourselves the first night just unhooking from the world. The second night our kids joined us and we had an afternoon of swimming. We ended the night with beautiful thunderstorms across the Delta, which are some of God’s greatest masterpieces. We sat on the screened in porch listening to the rain and went to bed to the sights and sound of the thunderstorm thru the wallnof windows inside the cabin. Perfect weekend get away.

Note to out-of-towners/folks unfamiliar with the Mississippi Delta region: there are LOTS of LARGE BUGS, especially at dusk. We stayed in the beginning of June, so other times of the year it isn’t usually as “busy”, but don’t be surprised by lots of insects! That being said, Lars had some bug spray and a porch that was screened in which definitely helps."

I did stay in the cold winter/rainy month but I stayed warm with the nice linens and the heater in the bathroom helped a lot . The horses and wildlife are beautiful and super cool to watch and appreciate. I didn’t ride because of busy work schedule but I will certainly come back to take them up on it! Archie was super nice and helpful as well. Kitchenette is small but efficient and while I don’t read much the selection made me want to. There wasn’t any storage for clothes like dressers or closets but I found the hooks on the bathroom door and the front hanger hook very helpful. Luggage racks came in handy too! All in all I recommend anyone to come stay I was happy and very pleased with my stay!

The cottage is so peaceful with only the sound of wildlife all around. It’s beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking at all of the books on the bookshelves. The photos do not do this place justice!
Lars is such a great host and very kindly took us on a tour of the farm in the morning. We feel very lucky to have spent some time here and will be recommending it to friends if and when they pass through. One of our best air bnb experiences for sure.
Thank you so much Lars, we really hope we can come back one day.

Stayed a few nights","Lars' place is just as perfect as you would expect. My partner and I were looking for a quiet weekend away from the city and we found just that. Lars met us as we pulled up the driveway, was friendly and respectful from the start. The cabin is perfect for a few days away; it has a small kitchen with range, sink, mini-fridge, microwave, and a few pots/pans/utensils. The bathroom had clean towels and a new bar of soap, bath/shower, and a few board games in the closet. The linens were clean and the cabin itself was fresh and tidy. We watched the sun rise from the SW facing porch, strolled around Lars' cotton fields, swam in the pool, and enjoyed the night from the screened in porch. The cabin is full of windows so you feel outside even when the mosquitoes push you in. We saw thousands of stars and the Milky Way, and even on hot days, the nights were cool and breezy. If you're looking for a safe, quiet place to hide out in the Mississippi Delta, I couldn't recommend Lars' cottage more."

I’m so sad I didn’t get to see the property during the day light— from what I could see it felt like a magical lush forest accompanied by the summer songs of crickets. So peaceful! The cottage itself was clean, cozy and the books were incredible selections. Like another reviewer said on here, I would definitely come back to spend some quality solo time to write.
Thanks again Lars for your hospitality and flexibility with my travel plans! Can’t wait to come back for the full experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Once we arrived, we viewed staying at the Peackock as a once in a lifetime experience. The pictures and descriptions do not do this place justice. Lars is such a great host and gave us a lot of information about surrounding areas and also the history of his wonderful farm. He took us in his 4 wheel drive and showed us buildings on his property that have true historical value, including a 1860 crop sharers store. That's the sort of building that you'd normally only see roped off on a tour.
Lars wife Cay gave me flowers on my birthday - a lovely gesture. Finn lived up to his celebrity status! Full of character and mischievousness.
The cabin was delightful and very clean with all the home comforts you need. The pool was a very welcome addition as it is very hot in June and we loved looking out to the fields whilst swimming in the cool water.
Cannot recommend this accommodation highly enough. We wish we could have stayed a lot longer."

The pool was great after a hot day riding with the top down. It was so quiet and peaceful . Just absolutely breathtaking scenery. Just needed more time. I will definitely be back and soon...

Stayed a few nights","The Delta Cottage is a nicely hidden spot not far from Indianola and the B.B. King museum, for the real Blues lovers. However, keep in mind about a number of things:
- ask Lars in advance the access code to the gate, otherwise you cannot enter the property (and it takes an hour for you to get in, as we had);
- the pool is sometimes not usable, we were there at the end of May and there was unfortunately no water in it (while we had explicitly chosen the Delta Cottage because of the pool);
- it has windows all around, not all of which can be blinded, so that means you will be up very early;
- and bring all the food and drinks (water and for your breakfast on the porch, among other things) yourself."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here while in the area for a baseball tournament that was being held at Delta State University, which is less than 20 minutes away. This small cottage on the farm for my husband and me was just perfect. It was so peaceful and beautiful there, and much better than being stuck in a hotel room. Being on the farm surrounded by the horses, Lucky the pig, Finn the farm dog, and the croaking of the frogs was so relaxing. The kitchen is small, but is well equipped with everything we needed. We would eat breakfast each morning on the screen porch while listening to the sounds of nature around us. The cabin is very clean and nicely decorated, with a rustic touch. Lars was not there when we arrived, but he contacted us to make sure we had directions and everything we needed when we checked in. During our stay, Lars gave us a tour of the farm and told us about his future plans for growth, including a baseball field. We brought our bikes, and went riding on the farm trails one morning. His house is next door in case you need anything, but far enough away so you have privacy at the cottage. Staying here was definitely one of the highlights of our trip."

The cottage is perfect for a retreat or a brief respite on a journey. I spent a month there and immensely enjoyed the experience. The setting is unusual for it is not simply perfectly flat fields, sculpted and maintained for farming. It is a farm with gently rolling hills (for the Mississippi Delta), pasture, cultivated fields, and woodland. The cottage looks out on a pasture that is a peaceful and serene setting. Lars and Cay Ely are outstanding hosts and make your visit to Peacock a wonderful experience."

Inside you have a seating area with two good size leather chairs, a little writing desk, a small kitchen and two perfectly appointed beds—and I am a sucker for a nice bed. Crisp sheets, down comforter, an easy-to-read-by light ... right up against giant windows displaying a magnificent thunderstorm. I woke the next morning to horses playfully scampering in the field, cardinals scratching at the ground, a fog lifting— or maybe not lifting. So the weather wasn’t perfect, but the stay was delightful. This place was on my radar by recommendation of a friend, but we booked at the last minute when we decided we didn’t want to drive any further that day. Lars responded immediately and got there to meet us right away. ( He actually lives right there but wasn’t home at the time.)
And as soon as we loaded the car to leave he appeared to see us off.
We weren’t there at a time for tennis or swimming, but yes! Both are right out your door.
A wonderfully peaceful respite. A few days here and I’m thinking I’d find myself writing the next southern novel... I would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This Mississippi Delta cottage is a magical little spot with a gorgeous view of fields where horses roam. The cottage is comfortable and there are lovely thoughtful touches throughout. It would be an absolute dream in warmer weather with a pool and tennis court just outside as well as two porches to take in the view. Lars is an outstanding host and took us and our kids on a rip roaring tour of the farm which involved a swamp tour, picking pecans and turnip greens, petting horses and the pet pig and all round fun. Lars and family are lovely and generous and left us with a strong desire to come back as soon as we possibly can."

It was such a tranquil spot, the horses were lovely, and FINN is the friendliest dog. We truly enjoyed our stay, once it cooled off. It was a HOT day to begin with."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for an out of the way perfectly appointed accommodation this is the place for you. As a bonus you'll meet Finn - the cutest little Jack Russel terrier. Sit on your back porch and gaze out on the ""back 40"" and watch the horses cavort. You're 15 minutes from Indianola or Cleveland. The kitchen is small but functional, the beds HUGE. Lars wasn't there the first couple of days of our stay but the minor start up problems we had were solved quickly by text and once he came back Lars took us on a tour of the farm and explained his plans for developing the property. Very ambitious but that's the kind of guy he is. Rest assured that if you book you will have a stay to remember."

Stayed about a week","Do not book!
There is no elevator and the apartment is on the 4th floor. The stairs look like something from a horror film, they are old, dusty and had trash everywhere. They handwrote the floor numbers on each door with a pencil. The building looks abandoned and very unsafe. You must enter the back door, but to get to the back door you need to walk through the gated parking lot that you cannot park in. Parking for Air BNB guess is on the street and unsafe.
Do not book!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place for someone who does not mind walking up several flights of stairs and finding parking as there is no designated parking and the tenants of the business left stickies on my car asking me not to park in public parking spots. There are also several condo restrictions, i.e. quiet hours from 10 pm to 10 am; the 1 day the elevator did work, it didn't work from 10 pm - 10 am. It was not ideal walking up 4 flights of stairs several times a day for two individuals in their late fifties with one with knee issues. Had we known everything upfront, we would have considered other options. The elevator still did not work on the last day requiring us to use the stairs to carry our luggage out."

Stayed about a week","I have only stayed in AirBnBs in Europe previously. This was my first US experience. It may be usual in the US but there was no ‘welcome pack’ with some basic foodstuffs, nor non-perishable foodstuffs from previous clients. Fridge was totally empty. In Europe you would find commonly used items like cooking oil etc.
However, on a more positive note, when I enquired re. extension on 10am checkout, Matt was very accommodating which was much appreciated.
Netflix on the TV, which was great.
Condo was very comfortable for 2 people- it might be a bit tight for 4 as there is one armchair & one couch in sitting room area.
Location downtown was super 😊"

The apartment is nice and quite but kind of bland without the decorations that a lot of the Airbnb’s I have stayed at. The building is older so remember to walk soft.
Kitchen has everything you need and so did the bathrooms. If you are staying for a length of time you might want to use a rolling cart to carry your stuff up to the apartment for the distance from parking to the apartment is not that far but everyone likes to save some trips.
Local cable was great too!"

My experiences with Matt, though, were all very positive. Communicates quickly and professionally. Understood my situation. I may return to Cleveland soon; if so, I will try to book Matt's place again."
