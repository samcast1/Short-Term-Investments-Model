Stayed about a week","My husband and I stayed in this house for 8 nights. We were very comfortable. We enjoyed everything.From the clean and comfortable beds, to the spacious kitchen, the spacious basement equipped with entertaining elements, the gorgeous backyard and the super fast internet. (Important if you need internet for remote work or streaming.)
All appliances work great! We cooked, we backed, we did laundry and watched a few movies on the tv without issues.
We really felt at home."

The space is fully furnished, has all the bathroom amenities that you may need, has a great little kitchen, very comfortable bed, and was nice and warm. Lindsey was super responsive, answered all of our questions, and took time to meet us and make us feel welcome. Great place to stay, will reschedule this location as we visit in the future."

The room was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. We were woken earlier than expected one of the mornings due to workers changing out flooring in the main house, though Lindsey was quick to apologize and other than missing out on 30 minutes of sleep, no harm done.
Lindsey was incredibly communicative before (every detail and photos were provided), during, and after our stay and we'd book this place again in a heartbeat!"

Aaron even had a small binder covering the history of the property and some things to do nearby, making us enjoy the stay even better. Our two dogs enjoyed the expansive property, getting a chance to get some exercise after being in the car. They even found the dog beds that were there. Having a place that allows dogs, feels like home and in a beautiful location...this is truly a rare find!!"

The time I did spend at the farm was amazing. The space is quiet, comfortable and very inviting. And, the outdoors was a HUGE bonus for Sampson (my dog) to run and romp after and before a long day of travel. He was so happy exploring the farmland and running through the fields. Highly recommend this picturesque and cozy spot!"

Stayed one night",We thoroughly enjoyed our short but sweet stay at Suzanne’s cottage. The cottage looks just like the pictures and feels even bigger in person. We had to be out early to attend a tour at Notre Dame or else I would’ve indulged in some of the continental breakfast items that Suzanne left in the fridge. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay with Suzanne again at either The Cottage or The Studio at Portage Lion.

Honorable mentions: the chickens, the swing set, and the pollinator gardens"

The place was literally like brand spanking new, very clean and well put together. The blanket smelled amazing and so did the hand soaps. The house animals (outside only) we’re adorable like something out a movie. My daughter wanted to take a hen and the dog home along with the blanket. House instructions were very clear. The keyless entry was awesome. Will definitely stay again if the opportunity presents itself."

Stayed a few nights","Our visit to South Bend for a college tour and Game Day at Notre Dame was enhanced by our stay at the The Cottage @ Portage Lion.
This quaint cottage at the back of the main property marries both function and form. It’s outdoor appearance is deceiving as it is quite spacious inside and the natural light, tastefully decorated interior and comfortable space and beds, allowed us much needed respite. The sleeping accommodations are extremely comfortable with plush bedding and great support. Though we only used it one evening to watch a movie, there is a television with Roku so that you can easily access all of your streaming apps. There is also wi-fi.
The kitchenette was ample with some breakfast foods in the morning (oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, granola and the like) and one has all of the kitchenware necessary to have a coffee, open a bottle of wine or have a small meal.
The bathroom though smaller, is absolutely enough and the shower has great water pressure. It should be noted that all fixtures, fittings, and appliances throughout the cottage are immaculate and seemingly new.
The outdoor property is just so, that we were lucky enough to watch a few beautiful autumn sunsets. We walked about, had morning coffee at the outdoor iron table set, threw the ball around with our kids in the side yard. The hens, kittens and sweet little Brittany Spaniel pup are quiet, but were also great fun for our son outdoors.
The location was perfect for us. Just a few minutes from the main highways and about 15 minutes from the college, which was the focal point of our stay. However, I would love to return to just explore the Michigan beaches or many of the other local highlights. We also passed many food offerings, supermarkets and gas stations close by.
Our hosts made booking very easy and answered all of our questions prior. While on-site, we met Suzanne and Tim who welcomed us with a smile and were eager to advise us with directions, recommendations and anything else we needed. However, it should be noted, though you are on their property, with your own parking space and cottage quarters you very much have solitude.
I would highly recommend a stay at The Cottage. I was so grateful after driving across many states and very busy days (and a UND shut out over Georgia Tech!) to return to a peaceful, serene and cozy private space for our family.
Thank you!"

Group trip","Cary was great about accommodating a slightly earlier arrival. House was in excellent condition, cleaned well, smelled great. We had six people and house only had one bathroom, so that was a bit problematic. It was in the listing, but we had not paid close enough attention. Could have used another bathroom, but that did not in any way negatively affect our opinion of the house. We were in town visiting our son in school and the location was convenient, no more than 5+ minute drive to campus."

Traveling from Boston to visit South End for the first time made us appreciate the area because of our great stay at Cary’s place. We felt so much at home and so safe as well. Cary even offered us to pick some of his cherry tomatoes in his garden if we like- now that is some kind Indiana’s warm hospitality! We will stay at Cary’s place again in a heartbeat.

It would be great for an extended stay.Up to date appliances and a nice front porch to sit out on in the evening. We would stay again .

Even though the house has a single window a/c the ground floor was always cool but does lead to a warm basementin the summer. We took our dog with us and he loved the yard although it's not fenced in completely we didn't worry about him wandering. For the most part it's a quiet road and friendly neighbors. We made great use of the nice deck on the front of the house when family came buy for a cookout.The house was well equipped with kitchen supplies, a querig pod coffee maker, airfryer and blender. Nice tv's in the living room and master bedroom. The only lacking part was storage for luggage/clothes as the closets were full and didn't want to have them in the basement as there was a slight musty smell. Overall we enjoyed our stay and had a nice time."

Easy check in at the key-pad grants you access to the home which offers an upstairs AND downstairs entertainment area, a full kitchen, a nice bathroom and plenty of space to spread out and make yourself at home. I enjoyed making my coffee and appreciating the patio in the mornings, my children loved exploring the yard and we felt right at home when it was time to tuck in after a long day exploring the surrounding area and visiting with family. There are many options for food and shopping within a short distance and the neighborhood felt very safe. Cary’s place is a great value for your stay in South Bend. I would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a comforting space for a weary traveler nearing the end of my 1,600 mile odyssey. This stop was one of the most important ones because I was visiting my oldest Niece on her break at Notre Dame and since we don't get to see each other that often I wanted to spend some quality time with her and yet at the same time give her her own space. Mission accomplished!
The home is situated on a huge double lot just a few miles from the I-80/90 Interchange in a peaceful neighborhood. It sits far enough back from the road that there was no noticeable road noise and the driveway is deep enough to allow at least 3-4 vehicles. The inside has been totally redone with great color schemes and a large flowing kitchen into the living room where a sleeper sofa is perfect for overflow guests. Completing the main floor are two bedrooms and the recently remodeled full bath. Direct TV is available, at no additional cost, in the Living Room for you to enjoy whatever strikes your fancy.
The lower level consists of an adequate sized bedroom and a suite of sorts with a queen sized bed and an additional 2nd living room to enjoy. There are TV's in all the other rooms in the house, including bedrooms, that are equipped with local channels only.
This was a short notice booking for me because I wanted my Niece to have her own space that wasn't in a hotel. She was able to enjoy the lower level suite for a much needed nap after an afternoon of shopping and then allowing me to make her a home cooked meal. The master bedroom bed was very firm and comfortable which allowed me a great nights sleep with my aching lower back.
Cary was very responsive to the few questions I had for him and was very enjoyable to talk too. He had the refrigerator stocked with breakfast items for our use and all the necessary condiments and cooking implements one needs to make a memorable meal. The gas grill in the driveway was perfect for cooking some great ribeye's & the motion floodlights on the front of the garage made it easy to see while cooking at night.
This property is only a few miles from the Notre Dame campus so if you're coming in for a game I suggest you call well in advance to book this bright and airy home.
I travel a lot and I highly recommend this home to my fellow travelers. Why stay in a hotel when for the same amount of money when you can have a whole house! I'll definitely stay here again.
All the best,
Tony"

Then you're only a 15 minute drive to anything you could want to do in the area. We took in a South Bend Cubs game at Four Winds Field.

Stayed a few nights","This was a good place to stay for a couple nights. It was really easy to check in and out with the keypad. The kitchen and living space were nicely set up, and the basement also had a nice lounge space. There were a couple beds on the main level (queen and twin) and two more beds in the basement. We stayed in the room with the queen on the main level, but the bed was quite hard and not very comfortable. I felt some of the other beds and it seemed like one in the basement was the softest but furthest from the bathroom, so we just stayed upstairs. We weren't at the house a lot, so this space worked fine for us for a couple nights."

We.also took the opportunity to visit the Studebaker Museum while in South Bend. Cary, or host, was great. We actually didn't meet in person, since his check in/out system is so simple, which was fine with me, because he stayed in contact with good communication through texting etc. There was a swing set in the back yard that kept my kids entertained. My 4 yr old daughter actually asked, (as we were pulling out of the driveway to leave) can we stay here next year when we come back to ride? So I guess we'll will see you next year!"

Our family of 4 enjoyed a relaxed family movie/dinner night in the living room with more channels than one could possibly watch. Bonus, when the teens were done with family movie night they did an extended movie night for themselves downstairs. Yes, we did the touristy stuff too because the house is so conveniently located close to Notre Dame and wonderful lunch places. The coded lock made for an easy self check in. Some of the houses around were in rough shape, but Cary's house was a gem and the street was calm and peaceful. The neighbors we did see were very pleasant. Cary was great to communicate with."

There are two places to park- across the street or behind the apartment. I really enjoyed using the parking space located behind the apartment. It was clearly marked and the fence made it feel more private. It gave me peace of mind knowing that my vehicle was on the property. I suggest parking your vehicle there instead of across the street.

Stayed one night","The place was very clean for the most part. the kitchen chairs had shoe prints and hair on them but besides that, the place was very clean. The parking was hard to find and the walls were very thin. We got woken up at 4 am and again at 6 am to people next to us talking. This was frustrating since we had to wake up early to drive to Tennessee. However, it is an apartment so it can happen. The hosts were very responsive and overall it was a pretty good experience"

Stayed a few nights","Kristah was a helpful host and the place was just as pictured! Perfect for a single person visiting South Bend or Notre Dame. Her communication was helpful and quick. The place is an apartment so beware you have neighbors. Sometimes they were a bit noisy. In addition, the area of town does not feel as safe as others closer to Notre Dame. I didn't have any problems and felt safe when in the Airbnb but I wouldn't want to go for a walk at night alone."

All the little extras just add to how lovely this place is. Pictures are spot on. The hosts check on you without being invasive, just a message or two to make sure the temperature of the apartment is comfortable and they respond to any of your messages very quickly! They are also very accommodating so don't hesitate to ask if you need something. We decided to park off the street vs in back since it's closer to the apartment door and had absolutely no issues!
If your searching for a place to stay, search no longer and just book now...You will not be disappointed!"

Stayed with a pet","Walter was very helpful when I initially reached out because I was interested in booking this place for a week but the listing didn't have pictures/a good description of the yard. I was bringing my 2 dogs with me and I prioritize having a fenced yard (it makes traveling less stressful on everyone). While there was not a fence at the time of our chat, Walter assured me that this was an upgrade they were looking to make and if I made my booking a fence would be in place before our arrival. The yard was excellent and my dogs loved running around in it. We had a bit of trouble in the first half of the week with the keyless entry but it seemed to smooth out as the week went on. The AC in the living room can also be a little loud so if you have sensitivities to noise (like me) it might bother you at times. However, it was a great week and I would stay at this place again."

I was stuck in another sdate with an alternator needing to be replaced. So I came in a day and a half late. The day I was supposed to leave. There was sixty mile an hour winds with white out conditions and snow The host wasn't very nice and ask if I would like to stay I ended up staying as the toll road was closed due to the weather conditions.

I usually travel to Airbnb’s with my own Lysol kitchen spray and a candle in case I don’t feel comfortable with the way things look or smell but never even touched them! Kenneth’s place was so tidy and clean we felt 100% comfortable.
There were clear instructions sent in advance and posted around one house so that we never had a question. For example, he had a note explaining the remote controls for easy access!!
We reached out a couple of times with questions during our stay and Kenneth always promptly replied. We were very appreciative!

Stayed with a pet","Kenneth’s place was fantastic, and we wouldn’t hesitate to go back again. We were in town for our nephew’s graduation party, so we didn’t actually get to spend a lot of time at the house but what we were there for was perfect. The property was extremely clean and beautifully decorated. We had been planning to bring our two golden retrievers with us but changed plans last minute. The fenced in back yard would have been perfect for the dogs.
The beds were all extremely comfortable and the bathrooms spotless. The walk-in shower in the master bath looked great and felt amazing at the end of the long day. The kitchen was one of the best stocked kitchens we’ve ever seen at an Airbnb. We will definitely stay here again if we’re in the area.
Thank you, Ken, for sharing your house with us!"

Kitchen is well stocked for cooking even though we didn’t need to this time around. We would definitely stay here again. There’s also a really great park we took the kids that is only 2 mins away. Thanks so much! Nothing negative about this place.

Stayed with a pet",Husband and I stayed for one night with our pups on our way from CT to Minnesota. Kenneth’s home is by far the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. The home was immaculate and very well-appointed. There were already covers on the couches (I always bring our own just in case) for the dogs and treats and a water bowl set out for them. The fenced in yard was perfect for letting them out. The kitchen had everything we needed for coffee in the morning (and more if we had had the time) and the two bathrooms are updated and spotless. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this place!

The beds are comfy and the kitchen has all the extras that anyone would need! The owner knew we were coming in for a funeral and not arriving until almost midnight. He left us a very kind-hearted sympathy card and a few breakfast items as he knew we would be leaving very early for the funeral. This owner is a definitely A+; kind and considerate. The house is a 10 and I would definitely recommend a stay there again. God bless you and your family Ken!

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for a HS robotics competition. Todd's place is in an older, quiet neighborhood. We loved it. Properties were on large plots of land and so you felt spaced out. It's probably perfect in the summer with the firepit and the front porch! Birds were already out singing. Host was responsive and communicated when there were issues regarding the previous tenants, which they promptly handled and which luckily didn't impact us or our stay by the time we arrived. The house is easy to find, check in was easy, and everything we needed was there. Clean and cozy inside, bed was comfortable, and the hot tub helped greatly after long days on bleacher seats. Everything you need is within 15 minutes easy drive- major shopping, groceries, restaurants, Notre Dame. I rec eating at Evil Czech Brewery and Pinellia Vegan Asian Restaurant! Our other teen decided to stay home, so it was a great stay for us, but there would've been plenty of space for all of us. We would stay at Todd's again!"

I liked that one room had many beds in it and one of the beds also has a trundle, plus that room has its own bathroom - perfect for kids. Nice backyard area with hottub, which got used a lot - and fire pit, which we did not use. Good location - a quick drive to food, and about 15 min drive to mall. My only recommendation is to bring more blankets as it got cold in winter and not a lot of blankets. But we had a great stay there for the weekend."

Positives: Hot tub, backyard, plenty of towels, coffee options, location - close to downtown and Notre Dame
Negatives: Beds were not comfortable (everyone has their own preference...but one of the reasons I chose this was because of the description of the mattresses - if you prefer a more ""pillow top"" feel - these are not for you.)"

Stayed a few nights","Todd’s place was comfortable, clean, and included some great amenities. The hot tub was so nice to come back to each night to relax. The bed was comfy and so were the pillows in my opinion!
The late check in time of 5pm with a 10am check out time are both on the extreme ends of the spectrum. He does this because you can have the option to purchase extra hours for $10 each to check in early or check out late. Along with a lot of other things you could purchase to use such as the grill and the laundry. I did not agree with the capitalist overwriting of hospitality especially since they are so eager for a 5 star review."

Some extra TLC would help the property match what is advertised. We had no issues with checking in or out. Instructions are well communicated beforehand.

On the cons side: the Wi-Fi was not amazing but manageable - and required filling out a form with personal information and consenting to receive emails from a third party which felt intrusive for a paid stay. Make sure you note that checkin starts late at 5pm and checkout is particularly early at 10am as of the date of our stay."

Stayed with kids","This property was in a quiet neighborhood and was a great value. We met up with our extended family and enjoyed the clean house and beautiful back yard. The back yard is large. We made use of the provided yard games and fire ring. The firewood is provided, along with newspapers and fire starters. The wood burned nice and slow and was perfect for cooking food over the fire! The hot tub was a nice addition. It was ready for use about 36 hours after check in. It needed to be filled/treated from the previous guests. Once the water was clear, our entire family enjoyed the hot tub. The kitchen area/counters, etc was just the right size for all the cooking we did. We found the living room to be inviting and comfortable to seat our family of 6. The front porch is a great place to sit, there is not much street traffic, so it is super relaxing. A couple of the reviews indicated they felt watched by the neighbors, but we did not feel that way. I can see where they may have thought that as the neighbors were out every time we were out side, but they were friendly and not a bother. Don't let that deter you. I appreciate the option to pay more (by the hour of 1,2,3 hours) for early check in or late check out. We did take advantage of that. We also took advantage of the additional rental fee for the use of the washer/dryer and the use of the grill. We did not pay extra to park in the garage, the driveway size was adequate and the neighborhood felt safe. The house is a great location and not far from Norte Dame, the zoo, etc. For sure check out Ninja Golf if your family is looking for something to do. Todd was great at communicating quickly when questions or needs came up. :)"

While I didn’t get to use many of the amenities, since my trip was pretty short, I did notice that just about anything I could think of could was provided. The kitchen was well stocked with supplies, the were a number of extra towels if needed, and a number of other things to make your stay easier. The location was great for the event I attended, and the neighborhood seemed to be relatively low-key and quiet area despite the number of house. It made for a very pleasant stay."

Actually a good sized place for a much longer stay than the one night we had in town. Nicely maintained. Very small hiccup when the combination lock didn’t work when we tried to check in, but Joan was VERY responsive, and was there with a key in “14 seconds”, just like she said she would be (even though we got there pretty late at night). Would definitely stay here again!"

The place is well laid out, the bed was super comfortable, kitchen has appliances, etc. If you are wanting a place to live for a week, in which to cook and call home, you will need to bring your own supplies. The kitchen has pots/pans/tableware, etc, but nothing else to help you cook. If these types of things do not matter for your stay, then you will have hit a home run."

Stayed a few nights","The good: clean, mostly peaceful, good price. The bad: host omitted some front door lock information, delaying entry. Separately, the sliding glass door would not lock. I contacted the host several times over multiple days, who did not take any action until I contacted Airbnb support directly over this safety issue. Then a polite young man, claiming to be a friend of the host, arrived to help, which he did. I felt safe enough to stay an extra night, which the host allowed and of course I paid for. After my stay, the host messaged me if I had anything negative to say, he’d prefer I message him privately, so he can “get it resolved ASAP“. He assigned blame to previous guests, ignored, redirected, provided multiple excuses and apologized profusely for not fixing the broken lock. If I had not contacted the Airbnb support desk, this issue would not have been fixed. I went back re-reading reviews to see what I missed. Check out Cathy’s review from July, 2023. Out of space or I could quote."

Stayed a few nights","Basically had a good stay here. Gone most of the days and there only to sleep & shower to get ready for the next day's adventures.
There were a few issues that were noticed immediately. The doorwall to the outside wouldn't lock after multiple attempts. While searching for something to block the door from opening, we found what appeared to be black mold inside the closet with a leaky water tank. We communicated with the host about these issues & he responded with answers that you would want to hear. He said he ""noticed"" the black in the closet earlier but didn't want to interrupt our stay. The mold that we saw could not have occurred over a short period of time. Hopefully the mold and doorwall lock were resolved PRIOR to the next guest's arrival.
The bed was comfortable, and the area was nice and quiet. Plan on using your own Amazon logon & password if you want to watch tv, and you won't be allowed to use the swimming pool onsite. Would have given higher rating without these issues."

Group trip","So many positives to this place. If the stay was separated from the neighborhood I would have no complaints at all. The area is not very well kept up and on one night an either drunk or high man tried to engage in conversation with my wife. I would not have wanted her to be staying alone in this neighborhood.
Besides that, the house has so much charm to it and we had a wonderful stay for our wedding week.
One minor disappointment was that the master bath has no outlets around the sink or mirror. This made it hard to use blow dryer and curling iron. Might be a nice addition if possible.
This is a great deal of a stay! It was very affordable, very clean and met our expectations. I love how close it is to Notre Dame. If I’m ever coming for ND athletics, this is the place."

This made for a very uncomfortable stay.

Stayed with kids",Our family of four (3 yr old and 7 month old) enjoyed our stay! There is a bathtub in the master bedroom for the kids and there was ample space. Our daughter enjoyed the bedroom w twin beds as she was able to put her bunny to sleep 😄. Hosts were very responsive and instructions to get into the home were straightforward. Thank you for a pleasant stay!

Stayed one night","The house is fabulous. Clean and tidy with plenty of room for our family. Nicely decorated and homey. They have thought of everything, even having little snacks available. House was warm when we arrived and smelled lovely.
Parking is limited in driveway unless you have a very small vehicle but street parking is available. Street noise was a little much at night but it is on a major street in city. However, there are fans in each room and earplugs provided.
The neighborhood seems to be going through a transition of sorts…some noisy passerbys, barking dogs, and loud neighbors. However, this house is nicest on block. Overall, great value compared to a hotel."

We got in late amd left early, so we didnt use all the amenities. It's a great mix of historic home and modern updates that make it convenient. It's the kind of space where hosting a family holiday would be easy amd beautiful."

Stayed with kids","We had a fabulous stay at The Portage House! Totally comfy, cozy and clean. Snacks, coffee and toiletries were greatly appreciated. As others noted, it is on a main thoroughfare with a bit of noise but we found it quiet inside. Other reviews described the neighborhood as ""rundown"" and ""rough"" but we found the review of it being ""transitional"" to be the most on-target with a number of houses currently being renovated. We felt safe coming and going and the very short route to Notre Dame was through a lovely neighborhood, though we weren't quite as comfortable walking in the opposite direction. A few minor items came up that needed Michele and Phillip's attention. They responded promptly and were very attentive to remedying them. We would definitely stay here again.
One tip I have for future guests that may not like hand-washing dishes as much as I don't~ disposable plates, bowels and cups for the win!"

Stayed one night","All bedrooms are upstairs. The main staircase to bedrooms is really steep and has no handrail. So, it was difficult to get upstairs to sleep and we left our luggage downstairs. There was laundry in the washer and the dryer. There is no dishwasher, but it is listed in the check-out/ check in instructions. Trash cans were half full. This is the 3rd Airbnb of our trip and the only one that had trash in the trash cans and laundry in the washer and dryer when we arrived. The washer and dryer are functional, and we were able to do laundry after we dried the comforter that was already in there and washed and dried the towels that were in the washer. We took all the trash out after our one-night stay. The staircase needs to be pictured in the listing so people can make a choice about where they stay. Stairs are a safety issue that are not mentioned in this listing. Overall, our one-night stay was very disappointing."

We loved everything about it, they have done such a good job with restoring and keeping it updated. Check in went smoothly, we loved the linens and blankets and the beds were comfy, we only needed 2 of the bedrooms. The location was perfect. Portage is a little busy but it didn’t bother us. Great roomy bathrooms. They left out some snacks for us in the kitchen. and toiletries in the bathroom. I think i walked around the home several times just staring in awe at how incredible the house was. The only suggestion I would make is maybe some luggage racks for the bedrooms. They do have dressers for your clothes and closets for your luggage that would work for longer stays. I would definitely stay here again."

Group trip","My husband & I traveled to South Bend with two of our college aged children & each brought a roommate. House was exactly like the photos & very comfortable. Six adults all had plenty of room in all areas of the house to hang out & sleep. Kitchen is a bit small on the counter space, but we had plenty of room to make breakfast. The dinner room table is large and enough for a sit down or to play cards.
House is nicely decorated & has a lot of thoughtful touches that make it feel very comfortable. The sound machine by the bed, ear plugs in hallway, fans in bed rooms... all items that I have at home & appreciated. Owners responsive to questions.
House is only a couple of miles to Notre Dame & restaurants. We always make a point to check out local restaurants. Fiddler's Hearth is a fun laid back Celtic pub with live music & good food. Another place for more variety is the Lauber. Everyone loved their food & the Lauber old fashion is delicious (even if you are not a rye person, try it!)."

When previous reviews described ""night noise"" I was ready to eyeroll. They aren't wrong, but it seems unavoidable. Drivers in the area tend to lack mufflers. HOWEVER, the options available with white noise machines and ear plugs* are quick and effective fixes. Do not let this be an issue. The positives outweigh anything.
* I did not need the ear plugs and I am a fussy sleeper."

Stayed a few nights",Michelle and Phillip had excellent communication. In fact they had an issue with one of the beds before we got there that prevented us from having the use of all three bedrooms but they were very willing to accommodate in any way they could for the last minute inconvenience. Traveling with three girls we were able to make due with no problem. The place was very clean. We made use of the complimentary coffee they had. The couch was super cozy. The only complaint I could give was the location. The next door neighbor was up late playing music. Also the house is on a corner sitting between two roads making the traffic pretty loud during the weekend evenings. They do offer noise machines though. And overall it was perfect for three woman staying in town for a school conference.

We had a little trouble entering the door initially and they were immediately responsive with a solution. It became no issue at all!
Highly recommend!!! :)"

Group trip","The house was so comfortable! Really decorated so nicely with everything we could want. Very spacious too. Only negative is parking. Just a very short driveway (our car sat over the sidewalk), and street parking otherwise. That being said, we never had any trouble finding a place to park, and the road was not too busy (the driveway is at the back of the house). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a very nice, very well kept house. We stayed only one night but wish we could have stayed longer. We cooked and hosted Christmas dinner there for some local relatives using the well-apportioned kitchen and large dining table, and did our gift exchange in the living room. We slept very comfortably in the three large bedrooms (with two full bathrooms), and did our laundry. We visited in the middle of a severe cold snap (single-digit temperatures), following a blizzard, so we didn't have a true chance to assess the area as we didn't spend much time outside. We've seen reviews questioning the area, but we had no problems. The next door neighbors (next to the driveway) were friendly when we checked in; we had no other issues with anyone, heard no ususual noises, etc. We were no more than 20 minutes from any place we had to go. We would highly recommend the house and will stay here again!"

Stayed with kids",The house is gorgeous! Super clean! Easy to find and the directions put me right into the driveway! We were there for a cheer competition and it was in the perfect area for where we needed to be. Literally our only complaint is that the house was very cold. Make sure you bring slippers and a hoodie. Couldnt find the thermostat so just hid under the blankets.

The kitchen area is a little small, but with these older homes, that seems to be very common.
The bedrooms were very nice and cozy & everything was clean and looked amazing!
I definitely recommend this home to anyone wanting a beautiful older home with great character and a feel at home stay!"

We were prepared for the noise that comes with an urban setting, so no surprises and honestly not a big deal. The hosts were thoughtful in all the details, even small ones that make a huge difference. We would stay again - and definitely recommend for anyone interested in the property.
*We we’re a family of six - 4 kids ranging from 9 to 17. And they loved it."

As far as the house, it was perfect. We wish there was a dishwasher (Instead of me). LOL
We loved this house and had a great trip! We will definitely book this house again if it’s available. Thank you to Michelle and Phillip!"

The beds are a bit firm and the rooms weren’t super dark at night or in the morning which didn’t make for the best sleeping experience. But overall the house was so cute and well kept. Only downside was the neighborhood not being the nicest or feeling the safest.
Communication with the host was great! Replies were very fast."

The house itself is stunning! Upgraded beautifully while keeping the charm of such an old house. Every amenity we could have needed! I was pleasantly surprised by the adjustable bed in the main suite! The noise machine was a nice bonus, as well, with the traffic noise. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, as long as you can manage stairs. I would have liked to stay here longer! Michele was super quick to respond to my messages, check in was super easy. Beds were super comfortable!"
