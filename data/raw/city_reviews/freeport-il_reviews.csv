Stayed with kids","I loved staying here. It was the perfect home away because I could wind down and relax. I told my cousin who lives near by it would be ideal for any out of town guests. She came over and felt the same. I did not hesitate to fully recommend it. Ample parking and outside furbabies and the cutest country cottage ever. Fully appointed kitchen, large master and bath. Spotless to boot. Ben and Laurie were perfect hosts and answered all my questions including some regarding the beautiful landscape. I would stay here again."

Stayed about a week","This is our 2nd time at Bens Place. We came just to stay here from Tempe Az. We could of stayed anywhere but chose to come back because of the peaceful vibe to the property. For us, its a vacation all its own just to stay here. We love their 2 dogs, Cash and Bella, whom are very sociable. Ben is a wonderful host providing a few snacks and things to make smores by the firepit among a few other special things which makes our stay so wonderful. For us, its home away from home. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else while in the Rockford area while visiting my family members there. Its in our plans to come back every year. We can only hope everyone who visits here enjoys it as much as we do."

Stayed a few nights","The pictures don't do the size of this place justice. It is HUGE. The kitchen is super spacious and the fridge enormous. I put a queen size blow up mattress on the floor of the living room and there was still a ton of walking room.
The bedroom has two large size closets and the extra bathroom was nice for the middle of the night.
Ben was super sweet the brief time we met him. It was just a little over 3 miles down the road from Lake Summerset where we were visiting family so no big deal to shoot back and forth. We will totally be back on future visits."

This is our base while spending time with family at Lake Summerset and it's perfect."

Stayed a few nights","This was our first airbnb. We cannot say enough about our visit. The place is so spectacular! Super clean and so many little extras such as little treats, some soft drinks and bottled water in the fridge, assorted chips, and even a s'mores kit for the fire pit out back. The firepit had four chairs and was well stocked with wood and all accessories to have a camp fire. We had plenty of privacy but Ben and his mother were available when we needed them. We had fun meeting their two dogs, Bella and Cash and Rosie the horse. For us, the place was like a small paradise. Can't say enough about Ben and his mother's hospitality. The are both wonderful people. The house had everything and more than we expected. We are from Tempe, Arizona and went back to have a small family reunion in Rockford, but after our stay we plan go back to Ben's place every year for a vacation because we enjoyed ourselves that much!"

Stayed one night","Ben's place is lovely! The setting is just gorgeous - open fields and farmland as far as you can see - and the guest house is charming and very comfortable. Ben supplied a full-height queen size air mattress that our daughter slept on, which was comfortable, and the place was plenty roomy for the three of us. The little back deck was a sweet place to have our morning coffee and granola bar (found in a basket of snacks that Ben has out for guests, along with the awesome s'mores fixings that others have mentioned). Ben and his mom are super friendly and hospitable and very quick to respond to any requests. We got to meet their two adorable dogs, their horse, and a good number of barn cats, which was a bonus! If we are passing through this part of the country again, we'll hope to stay at Ben's place."

Ben will respond to any questions you have extremely quickly, he’s great! We have relatives that live at the lake and this is only a 5 to 8 minute drive to the Summerset lake which is perfect for us! He has a beautiful horse that has two different colored eyes and it’s gorgeous. There’s some little barn kitties that made our day. He goes above and beyond by supplying s’more stuff and snacks. We were very impressed with everything and highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at Ben's place to avoid overcrowding with family at Lake Summerset over a long week-end, and this location was ideal for that - less than 10 minutes away. Because we left in the morning and didn't return until evening, we didn't wander the grounds here, but we found the accommodations spacious and very clean, we appreciated the treats as well as the drinks in the frig,and Ben answered any questions we had within minutes. I'd like to note that the accessible (larger) bathroom is attached to the bedroom, which is a convenience that may not be clear from the pictures. There are two closets in the bedroom, so plenty of room to unpack if you were here for a longer stay. We would definitely return."

Stayed with kids","The cutest little house ever! The location is perfect and close to everything in Freeport. Finding it was easy and parking was available in the alley or out on the street. Everything inside was very clean and comfortable.
The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils if you choose to cook there and host provided coffee pods, tea bags, and even a French press for those who prefer to go that route. Beds were comfortable and rooms were dark at night, no outside light filtered in. Each bedroom had a dresser and a walk in closet so bags weren't taking up room in the bedroom. Bathroom was well stocked as well. Living room was spacious and comfortable and was a nice place to chill out after a busy day.
The house is beautiful inside and out. I loved the built-ins and all of the wood work. It encompassed so much of the beautiful old houses in Freeport. So much character! I personally loved how it was decorated with all of its nods to Freeport history.
Host was accommodating, was available when I had questions and very nice to chat with. We will definitely recommend this place to anyone who visits Freeport and will be sure to try to stay here again next time we visit! One of the best experiences of our little Freeport visit."

Stayed a few nights",This is hands-down the best Airbnb experience I’ve had (and I’ve stayed a quite few.) The property is meticulously well-cared for and on a quite street close to stores and restaurants. I especially appreciated having the option between keurig coffee and a French press. Stephen and his wife are attentive and communicative hosts.

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely home in a quiet, conveniently-located area. Check-in was simple and there was plenty of easy parking. Stephen was a kind and communicative host, and he even offered to let me check in early. Lots of thoughtful little touches like local snack-foods, a brand new kitchen sponge still in the packaging, and a nice selection of teas enhanced my stay.
One thing prospective guests should be aware of is that this is a very highly scented home: plug-in air fresheners, bedding and towels washed with heavily-fragranced laundry products, the strong smell of something like Febreze in the living area, etc. Some guests may enjoy this! But for anyone who suffers from allergies, migraines, or other sensitivities to fragrances, this is definitely something you'll want to consider before booking. (Also, while this home has many beautiful large windows that fill the house with lovely natural light, unfortunately, most of the windows cannot be opened, so airing out the house is difficult.)"

Stayed over a week","My family and I booked this Airbnb on the spare of the moment to visit my terminally ill mom who had taken a turn for the worst. Despite it being a typical gray Mid-West winter the Airbnb offered a very light and airy feel that helped lifted our spirits during challenging times. Although we experienced a black out (due to a winter storm, the house is well insulated and the heat was plentiful before the storm so the house stayed comfortably warm until ComEd was able to restore power. Stephen provided us a nice gift card to Apple Bees for our inconvenience as well as offered us an additional day of stay as a gift to my family (checking out Dec 26th vs our original day of Dec 25th) which helped tremendously as my mom passed on December 20th and we had no concrete plans for Christmas. My family and I loved the Airbnb and are grateful for Stephen's hospitality. We would absolutely stay here again!"

The views are obviously incredible, photos don’t do it justice. Every aspect of this stay was perfect for a getaway and we’d do it again in a heartbeat."

It was clean and spacious and I just cannot say enough about this wonderful place. We will be back!!!"

The two living spaces are so great for separate spaces for adult/kids. The large windows make you feel one with nature. Outside you’ll find rustic surroundings along the river. You may even see eagles fly over like we did. Evenings are best spent around the fire pit roasting s’mores. We were a little skeptical pulling in, but once you find it and settle in it’s a great cabin getaway. Bring life jackets if you have kids running around. Also boots if it’s spring (mud). Fishing poles are an excellent idea. And a book to cozy up by fire."

The house is cozy but could comfortably fit a bigger group, and it is well appointed with everything you'd need for a family vacation.

We enjoyed laying in the yard birding (bring your good binoculars!) and reading so much, we only left the property to go tubing one day (highly recommended, through White Pelican!)
We cooked a ton with a plenty stocked kitchen and enjoyed the fire pit.
On our way out of town we stopped at the amazing Flamingo Palace antique shop and a few other surrounding stores.
We are already thinking of coming again to explore hiking and cooler temps!
The house was clean, comfortable, and with the greenery filled in, so secluded! I feel like it was better than the photos which seem to be mostly taken in winter. We prioritized our time outside. We don’t mind a little May Flies in our June though- this is riverside country chillin’ and if you hate nature, get lost! None of the bugs were biting, you’ll be fine.

From the outside I thought the home didn't look too big but it does not feel like that on the inside. 3 decent sized bedrooms, bathroom, utility closet with washer & dryer, kitchen and living room with open floor plan, and a sunroom/dining room. The view from the sunroom is so beautiful. The decor and view give the cabin a very peaceful and relaxing vibe. The only bad part was the bugs. At least to a city girl, they're huge and there are so many. Because of the bugs we mostly stayed inside but we still enjoyed our stay so much. On the last day it was much cooler and there were very few bugs. Would love to come back again in the fall or winter. Heather is also a great host! She provided a brochure prior to our stay that had directions, a breakdown of what to expect in each room, things to do nearby, check out rules, etc. It had a ton of great information in it. She also checked in with us throughout our stay and was ready to help whenever needed. Thank you, Heather!"

The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook meals and enjoy them on the porch that has panoramic views of the rock river. The new fire pit area was a great spot that we made sure to enjoy every night. We had A bonfire and firewood was provided for $5 a bundle. We kayaked the first day and there is personal kayaks on property and a great launch point to be at one with the water!

The house is great - huge windows so you can still watch the beautiful outdoor scene when it’s time to come in, and everything you need for a great experience. We will definitely come again."

Close to restaurants in town. Quiet area with a great private view. Clean kitchen stocked for cooking. Heather was quick to respond with answers to our questions. Welcome packet has list of local hospitals, dentist, pharmacy, recreation and food. Fun board games provided. Great place for a girls getaway, family time.

Not to mention, the hosts were incredibly prompt in response to our questions and beyond helpful. The cabin is perfect for puzzles, fires, reading, hiking, and disconnecting from the world (and screens!) for a bit.
Note: If visiting in the winter be prepared to walk over ice to get inside the cabin and ensure your car can handle driving on ice, not only an unpaved driveway.
Additionally, we have T-Mobile and found ourselves with a very weak, 1-bar signal the entire time. An added reminder of our need to unplug!"

*fyi: Sort of noted in property details but... the owners house is attached to the rental by a main entrance (left is rental/ right is owners). Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of."

Stayed with a pet","We had a truly incredible visit! The house is really nice, it feels brand new with modern fixtures and a cozy cabin asthetic. The owners clearly put a lot of care into the home. Dan met us when we arrived and couldn't have been more welcoming and friendly (they even left us a bottle of local wine and a sweet card). The views are spectacular, we loved walking around the property and taking the trails down to the pond. We enjoyed the large hot tub and luxurious shower. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you'll need. The owners live in an adjoining home but the layout makes it feel very private and the two sections don't share a wall so you can't hear each other."

Stayed with a pet",This was a wonderful place to spend the weekend with friends. It was everything we wanted and more. When we arrived we met Dan and he offered to show us around their families farm. They were generous and shared their experiences with agriculture. Stockton was small and quiet which was a nice break from living in a college town and they are also 30 minutes away from Galena. I would recommend Kelly and Dans place to anyone looking for a quiet getaway.

The space was just a little closer quarters than I expected from the photos, so I’d keep that in mind if you have four guests like us. But all in all a lovely place."

Stayed with a pet","I would definitely book this again. Everything inside and out well taken care of. No shabby furniture, towels, pillows or linens. Plenty of kitchen utensils and dinnerware. Kitchen is a walk-through galley that is tiny. We found the bar in the main living area where we socialized and ate. We did only breakfast at the cabin so for us the kitchen was very adequate. The only thing that would be helpful for others would be a dishwasher but cabin is on septic. We would recommend guests think about disposable dinnerware. Bathroom very nice. Open sleeping area with two small twins fitted under slanted roof would be a tight sleeping arrangement for larger adults. or adults wishing more privacy in sleeping quarters. This open sleeping area adjoins the bedroom with sliding doors. Pictures in the listing are accurate and give a guest a good look at the entire layout and arrangements. Hot tub is BIG and was fun. The wrap around deck will be wonderful in warmer weather. Great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","This airbnb was so clean and comfy! Dan and Kellie put up instructions around the house that helped us be more familiar with it. Their cabin was also complete with all the home essentials you would need! The tub was the best part because it was not only perfect for the weather, but Dan also ensured that he cleaned and changed the water before we used it.
The hosts were also very accommodating as they offered us to check-out late due to the bad weather conditions. They were also proactive because when the wifi got disconnected, they immediately messaged us and offered a device we could use as our hotspot.
My only comment was maybe to put up a bigger sign near the parking about where the cabin is located so future guests will not mistake their house as part of the rental. Notes were in the Airbnb description but just to make sure that it's clearer for the other guests who don't have access to that."

We brought our family of six and enjoyed everything about our stay: Hiking the mowed paths in the forest/grasslands, fires under the beautiful star filled skies, evening dips in the hot tub, playing sports in the beautiful grass field and hiking down to the pond to fish and walk around. Some might be hesitant because the cabin is connected to the main house but let me tell you there's no feeling of ""shared"" space. You get the enjoy the property unbothered. That said, when we did walk around to see the animals and the rest of the farm Dan, Kellie and their family couldn't have been more welcoming to us. We can't wait to come back when the veggies and berries are ready for harvest!"

The house is on a tall hill and has great views and you feel like you're totally secluded from the world. Clean hot tub, great outdoor furniture, lawn games and a sturdy kite. I would absolutely stay here again."

It’s a 30 minute drive or so to Galena and we loved all the shopping and eating!!! We also enjoyed visiting a brewery and winery followed by some antique shopping for the home. This was a perfect trip and exactly what we needed after a long couple years of raising 4 young kids."

The cabin itself was just amazing. Beautiful and thoughtful design touches throughout made our stay so comfortable and cozy. It was also spotlessly clean, which made us feel right at home instantly. The swing, the fire pit, wrap around patio, the hot tub, and even a little wood platform to do yoga! We couldn't ask for anything more. Our dog loves to play fetch, and it was like heaven for him. He was very disappointed when he saw that we drove home...no joke! Needless to say, we hope to have another vacation at Highview Country Escape soon."

We enjoyed the outdoors on the days it didn’t rain but also enjoyed indoors when it did. I love that the house has big windows, it lets all the light and scenery shine. My favorite was using the swing next to the house and feeling the breeze. Sunsets in the hot tub were also top notch. The only thing I recommend is for folks to bring food with them; compared to Chicago there was not a lot of options and/ or places were closed so we couldn’t order out. Will book again for sure !"

The large windows on all sides you can enjoy the progression of light from sunrises to sunsets to stars. The outdoor hot tub is a special treat for relaxation surrounded on three sides by a huge deck. The 20+ acres openland and wooded areas give you a real sense of seclusion. You can enjoy a hike down to the swing, the pond, the woods or the farmstead to appreciate the wide open country. The large living room with wet bar, dining table, and comfortable seating is great for families to gather. We appreciated all the games, books and brochures that were made available."

Well thought out and makes use of every space possible. The cabin was ULTRA clean and we felt very safe and like extra attention was paid to ensuring this is as Covid friendly as possible. Dan and Kellie were very flexible with us and thoughtful around letting our kids complete their remote learning while we had our mini-vacation - they left an extra hot spot for us to use and allowed us to stay out on the deck a bit past check out time while the cabin was cleaned for the next guests so the kids could finish up schooling. Wifi was adequate for both our kids to be on zoom meetings without issue. Highly recommend this location for some R&R."

It was beautifully decorated and wonderfully comfortable; especially the thoughtful touches like lighting, multi-use architecture, and plethora of comfort items. It had almost everything we needed and when we wanted a specialized kitchen tool that wasn't stocked, Kellie and Dan let us borrow it from their home! Grocery was down the street, trails on the property to hike around, and even a farm stand at the beginning of their property. The hot tub, scenery, and amenities of the cabin were outstanding. My partner and I repeatedly remarked that we felt like we were in our own Eden staying there. Our pup loved it too! It was enjoyable when it was sunny and rainy as the windows made you feel a part of the surrounding nature whatever the climate. (Pro tips- bring candles! It is so magical at night when lit by candles. And, place your portable speaker on the second floor towards the railing to bathe the home in music!) We will definitely be back next time we need an escape from the world. 10/10 would highly recommend!! THANK YOU for letting us recharge in your lovely space and being so lovely to work with <3
(Shout out to Mike's Engine Works! They had easy and affordable ATV rentals with over 100 miles of trails! It was only 30 minutes from the cabin)"

Stayed a few nights","Highview Country Escape lived up to its name and then some. During this unprecendented time, we found ourselves looking for a socially distant getaway. Highview fit the bill with sweeping views, gorgeous sunrises and sunsets and stars as far as the eye can see. We enjoyed quiet time on the spacious deck, observed constellations from the hot tub and took long walks on the property. We just returned and are already planning to make this an annual tradition.

Cabin was stocked with everything we needed for a very comfortable weekend away! The hosts are fantastic and they are available if any concerns arise. The cabin has modern decor touches and the hot tub was a wonderful feature!! Thank you Dan and Kellie... we look forward to renting here again!!

Group trip","The views from this rental are absolutely amazing, the pictures truly don’t do it justice. We were pleasantly surprised to be on top of a hill and be able to see miles of rolling farmland in every direction.
The property is perfectly secluded and has everything you need for a perfect weekend away. The cabin itself has a ton of great features - ample fridge space, plenty of seating, a grill, a fire pit, a covered patio furniture set, and of course the hot tub! The hot tub provided the perfect view of the sunset between the trees and of the stars above.
Our dog loved running around in the grass and was very disappointed on Sunday when he realized that this was not a permanent move.
Kellie and Dan were great hosts! They were very responsive to all of our questions and left very detailed instructions for check in and check out procedures. We would love to make this an annual trip."

Dan and Kellie went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed including firewood, passes to apple canyon lake pool/beach, and even some cold beverages to enjoy with the sunsets. The cabin was a dream for us, our two year old, and our golden-doodle, we can’t wait to return."

Stayed with kids","Absolutely wonderful cabin and location. We were looking to get away over the 4th of July and this place was everything we were looking for and more. You can feel the love and care that Dan and Kellie put into their place. The cabin is clean, stylish, and very comfortable. The view from the cabin is breathtaking. I do not think I would ever get tired of sitting out by the fire on the top of the hill. If you are looking to get away from the city this place is perfect!
Our kids also loved the hot tub as well as access to Apple Canyon Lake. Because of Covid you had to make a reservation to go to the lake or pool at Apple Canyon and could only stay for 90 minutes. I am happy that the association is doing that because it made it very easy to social distant at both the beach and pool. The lake and pool are both very very nice. Dan was great about making reservations for us. If not for Covid you would have unlimited access to the pool and beach, so if you are reading this after Covid (hopefully not too long in the future) all the better!
All in all I cannot say enough good things about this place. We hope to come back again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place to get away and be in nature, with some amazing views then look no further than Dan & Kellie’s place.
Dan & Kellie have a spectacular place in a spectacular location, the 360 views on the wrap around deck will have you longing to spend more times outside of the house then inside.
Once you are there you don’t have to leave for anything the full kitchen has everything you need, tasteful touches include the beer and wine cooler, and super awesome lighted counter in the main area.
The hot tub on the west side of the house was perfect to relax while watching the sunset and then the 100s of stars above and the fireflies in the field below the deck. Mornings filled with walking the nicely cut nature paths and enjoying the sunflowers.
So I say again, if you are a nature person you’re gonna love this place, if you’re looking to get away from the bustling city life you’re gonna love this place, if you’re just looking for a trip to just relax you’re gonna love this place.
From booking, to the stay, to check out Dan and Kellie were easy to communicate with, available to answer questions, and were easy to work with. All instructions were clear and easy to follow, and they even shipped my flip flops that I accidentally forgot at the house.
We loved staying and will most certainly be back again!!"

Dan and Kellie are fantastic hosts and the cabin is a bout as perfect a place that you could want if you are looking for a beautiful getaway surrounded by nature. Looking out across the property you feel like you’re on top of the world. A beautiful home that couldn’t feel more like home. All the amenities you’d need and a few you wouldn’t expect. The wraparound deck has views that belong on postcards. The fact that this is only a short drive from Galena is only a plus. If you want to get away and relax in a cabin paradise, this is the place."

Full laundry room with all of the things; laundry detergent, iron, ironing board, spray starch, huge closets and plenty of hangers, etc. The kitchen was stocked with everything and the grocery store was only a couple of minutes away. Our kids had plenty of room to play (the toys were CLUTCH), stretch out and sleep. The beds and linens were comfortable and cozy. We brought our own sound machine and fan, would be an awesome addition to the place if not already there. We used the pack ‘n’ play too - loved not having to bring our own. We will absolutely be staying here again if we need a place in Freeport. 10/10 rating!!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was exactly as described and pictured on the website. Staying there I found many extras that made it an extra comfortable stay. In the Master Bedroom there were nightstands on either side of the king sized bed. Each nightstand contained: 1) Lights that when touched turned on a low, medium then high light then back to off. So easy to get the right light level. 2) A plug in for charging your phone. 3) A coaster for a glass or plastic bottle. 4) One of the nightstands contained a clock with large numbers and it also projected the time on the ceiling. Very convenient! And the bed had a heated mattress pad. When I was in Freeport it was cold, and getting into heated sheets was a treat!
The Master Bedroom also includes: 1) a very large closet, 2) a nice sized desk with a lamp and an installed plug-in. I used the desk to plug in my lighted make-up mirror and apply my make-up. Again, so convient! 3) A large flat screen TV.
Everything was clean & comfortable. Just wonderful!"

The location was in a nice & quiet neighborhood close enough to town for any needs that may arise.
We felt welcomed from the start, even from 4 deer we saw in the yard upon waking the first morning (which the kids absolutely loved!). This was by far our family's favorite AirBnb stay yet--the hosts absolutely went above & beyond. Thanks again!"

I needed to work during the days and there was a nice desk area that is quiet and separate from the main living/dining room. The Wi-Fi was solid and speedy. Going out at night was easy with automatic lights along the path and no stairs to navigate.
Finally, we had the opportunity to meet Frank and Moonyean and they are wonderfully kind people. So good to know my childhood hometown still has great residents to continue its legacy."

Stayed with kids","Such a beautiful place. My family and I stayed there from Decmeber 21-26, 2021 as we were visiting Freeport. The pictures do no justice on how beautiful this place is. I purchased items to take such as cleaning supplies, eating utensil, etc...I ended up bring it back home. They had everything except food (even had many spices/seasonings). Dish and laundry detergents, plenty of towels, all household needs. Even bodywash and shampoo. Everyday we discovered more. Frank and Moonyean are very responsive to questions and so kind. It was truly a home away from home. Love the fixtures and decor. I can go on and on. To say the least, and amazing place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","This residence was an incredible find indeed! The space was beautifully appointed with modern decor, comfortable furnishings and beds, and all the amenities of home. Traveling with 3 children under the age of 6, finding a home that not only allows but welcomes children made traveling significantly easier. Pack-n-play, high chair, toilet seat, infant bath, and a large assortment of toys that kept the kids entertained for the duration of the trip were provided.
The hosts, Frank & Moonyean, were great to work with; they were helpful and quick to respond to any questions we had before and during our trip. As a travel agent, the experience that Frank & Moonyean provided was the quality of stay that I expect for any of my clients."

This place was clearly crafted with love, and you immediately feel right at home. We stayed just for one night, but quickly decided we must plan a return trip and stay much longer--not only to soak it all in, but to see Jilly and Kenbob again--what lovely hosts and just terrific people!"

They were wonderful hosts and Jilly was very proactive to let me know about the flooding on their property and kept me updated with their lakefront property status 😆. They both greeted me upon arrival (with dogs in tow) and after some conversation they retired to their house for the night. They were more than happy to let me roam around the property at night to setup my telescope to take some pictures. I hope to return someday for a longer stay and explore their property more and the surrounding area.

Whatever your vibe, you can count on gracious hosts, comfortable accommodations, beautiful surroundings, and a cool place to hang out. My dog had as much fun as I did. Jilly and KB were the kind of hosts you have to resist from inviting in to stay longer, or from knocking on their door just to shoot the breeze. Plenty of land to wander. The surrounding moat of a river/creek is lovely. Plenty of food and drink within a quick drive. There are at least 3 microbreweries that deserve a visit. I say ""I'll be back a lot."" This time I meant it."

They went out of their way to make us feel at home. The property is unbelievably beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. I wish we would've been able to stay longer. Easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had."

Hoping to drive this way sometime soon so we could enjoy this place again.
Pictures and descriptions are very accurate.
Thank you for such enjoyable stay. We loved it."

We took advantage of all the things their kitchen offered (including the hot plate). We were able to not only save money because the daily rate was so affordable but we also saved money cooking for ourselves. Little details through out the home make you feel like someone read your mind. Side note: Highly recommend driving to Castle Rock and White Pines for hiking."

Stayed a few nights",Between me and my husband's accounts we have stayed at dozens of airbnbs and this is the only one I have revisited 3 times now and more to come. The house and surroundings are amazing as you'll see everyone else said. Unique home with much care and thought and land that gives you freedom and a sense of peace. Jill and KenBob are the absolute best though which tops it all! The thoughtfulness and caring they have has truly made each visit ove over the top and priceless. The 1st time I stayed there. It was on mother's day with my mom and we had an amazing time. The 2nd time I was there. I brought my husband and my two kids and we also had an amazing time. (Us and the kids genuinely love playing with the dogs and the cat. That goes for all three visits). And this third visit was a daughter and daddy get away. My dad can't walk too well these days and their thoughtfulness really helped us have an amazing time. I've always visited in spring and am looking forward to a fall visit.

There is a perfect spot for a little picnic in the corner of their property next to the river. The dogs and cat were an absolute joy to have around, greeting you when you first come makes the whole stay a lot better. We had absolutely no issues for the 2 days we stayed and it couldn’t of been a better place to be."

It is a delightful restoration of a good-sized machine shop on a rural farmstead. There is comfortable furniture and a comfortable bed, and some charming and hurmorous touches. Jilly and Kenbob (and their friendly dogs) met us with a friendly and enthusiastic welcome. The weather was cold with intermittent rain; had it been clear and warmer, we would have taken advantage of walking trails."

Stayed with a pet","When on a road trip, if possible I try to find a nice cozy airbnb instead of just another highway exit hotel. Jilly’s place was a bit more off the path from my intended route, but I guessed it would be worth doing and it truly was. After a long day of driving, this was the perfect refuge to unwind and rejuvenate. The hosts are warm and delightful people, including their dogs, and the cottage is a well-appointed, cheerful, and really wonderful home away from home. The setting is quiet and peaceful, the perfect place for a respite or a longer retreat. I would live to come back and just spend a week reading, writing, or painting, because this place has a creative and nurturing vibe and would be a great retreat . I am also grateful that my dog was so welcome, the whole place is very pet friendly. Wonderful experience! Thank you!"

If we had had more time would have loved to get some time to hear some of our hosts’ stories.

We stayed during a storm, but before it started my pup was able to hike the trail all around the quarry and the corn field and had a blast exploring. I am sure during warmer months, it's even more beautiful. The home itself is super clean and comfortable with all the amenities you could need for the bathroom and kitchen. You feel far away but only 5 min to town. My only regret was staying one night, do not hesitate to book here!"

Stayed one night","Jilly and Ken Bob were very friendly from the moment we pulled in, we enjoyed their warm reception and appreciated Jilly’s hard work and her phone call to let us know we she had the cabin waiting and ready if we would like to do an early check in.
Their place is absolutely adorable, very welcoming with the feel of being a home away from home, all the personal touches were a joy to discover, the wood beams, raised toilet tank with a old fashion feel was fun to experience.
KenBob to some time to show us around his place, showing us a few of his new/recent projects, which was neat to see and we enjoyed the stroll along the ridge above the quarry where we were able to watch both ducks and geese visiting the water on their return flight back north, it is a one of a kind property that everyone should experience and we look forward to a return trip next year, we liked to thank you both for the unique experience, and kindness you showed."

Stayed about a week","Everything about my solo stay at Westhaven (for 10 days, with my pup) was exactly what I needed & was hoping for. The surroundings are so serene, the trails are gorgeous (even in the winter!), & Jilly and Kenbob were the absolute best.
Westhaven was exactly as described -- the internet was great for everything except for video calls, I had to take those from my phone (for some reason, Verizon cell service worked better for Microsoft Teams than the wifi, but I work in IT & the wifi didn't give me any other problems), the shower was great, the water was hot, the bed was comfy, and I loved that there was a grill in addition to the hot plate (and electric tea kettle, toaster oven, coffee maker!).
Not only were Jilly and Kenbob incredibly kind and wonderful to chat with (and their dogs are the hecking sweetest), I had a safety concern about the door when I got there, and they didn't bat an eyelash figuring out a solution.
Thank you for making sure that Cricket and I had the best time!"

Stayed one night","This was our 2nd stay here. It's an unusual location, a repurposed farm building on a working farm (no animals except their dogs). It's fairly close to Freeport, IL, just a couple miles away but on a quiet road and down a long gravel driveway, nestled in the rolling farmland and woods of the area, with no noise or lights to disturb us. Freeport is a funny little city, small but with plenty of amenities, and cheap too! We stayed one night, on New Year's Day, and stayed in, reading and relaxing mostly, but last time we were here we took a long walk on the property with Jilly and Kenbob (long-ish, for us, I'm told Jilly's walks can cover 5-9 miles). On our 2nd stay we saw they had added several new interesting features to the place. The bed and furniture were comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom were fantastic, the heating worked very well, and there must be 100 interesting and decorative features around the apartment. We will return again soon."

I loved the sheet metal ceiling the samecolor as my barn at home. It was warm and cozy. The TV had Netflicks. The kitchen does not have a big stove but there was hotplate, toaster oven and microwave for the little cooking we did. We were very comfortable. It was fun discoving all the interesting antiques on the walls and beams. The bathroom cute. I liked the old fashion look wirh the raised toilet water tank.

Stayed one night","♡♡♡ Jilly & her husband have poured their heart & soul into a beautiful place nestled in the countryside that they call Westhaven. When you find the driveway, just take a momemt to pause at the end and think about relaxing from that moment on.
Take in the beauty as you meander down the long driveway which crosses over a creek & eventually brings you to your lovely accommodations. Upon arrival you'll admire the unique barn-type structure you'll be hanging out in. The full, open concept studio-type living quarters is VERY inviting! Just like the pictures, it has an eclectic rustic style that instantly makes you feel warm & fuzzy. It seems if you need anything...just ASK! (They say that phrase often in their very well put together ""welcome book"")
They have thought of everything...even down to the handy fire extinguisher perfectly located & visible right next to an exit door and in close proximity to the kitchen! ♡ Let's hope no one EVER has to use it! :) They have a well stocked kitchen including a toaster oven, hot & cold water dispenser, 2 burner stove, small refrigerator w/ a small freezer, BBQ grill & microwave. Also included are pots and pans, plates, wine glasses, mugs, cooking utensils, forks/knives/spoons, baggies, aluminum foil, etc, etc, etc! Oh! And it's help yourself to spices, hot cocoa, S&P & whatever else is available to eat.
The bathroom is spacious & has a cozy feeling with it's rustic wood decor. This room also has all the ""goodies"" you need (toothpaste, shampoo, etc) in case you forget something from home.
There are very nice porches on both sides of the building. One side has a few chairs and an amazing overlook of beautiful farm land, the other side has a BBQ grill & a table and chairs for those long, warm, beautiful spring, summer or fall days and nights.
If you're pondering this place DO NOT HESITATE!! I learned they are booked up most available days. I'm lucky I found this gem & can't wait to go back. It truly feels like a slice of country heaven. ♡"

Stayed with kids","My husband and I were visiting from Arizona and had the pleasure of staying at Westhaven (Cozy Country Home) for 6 nights.
Jilly and Ken-Bob, are very personable (along with their friendly dogs, Axel and Cujo)! They personally greeted us at check-in and check-out. They give us space but also were easy to contact and checked in to see how we were doing in a very welcoming and friendly manner. Can’t say enough about their personalities! As the sign in their home says, ""Enter As Strangers Leave as Friends"" :)
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay; it was perfect from the beginning of booking to check-out. We would recommend staying here and are looking forward to our next visit back to Freeport! Thank you, for sharing your cozy country home and making our stay memorable. Bill and Vicki
PS: A binder is provided with details on the house, suggestions of things to do, and history about the area that is very helpful. The home offers many amenities – interesting décor, comfy bedding, a thermostat to set at your liking, the bathroom had toiletry items and a nice hot shower, the kitchen had cooking options, coffee, tea, oatmeal, popcorn, etc. Outside there’s a little deck with a grill, if you feel adventurous, there are lots of trails and water options to explore (we enjoyed inside and outdoors with our grandchildren)."

-location (close enough for a quick weekend trip from Chicago but far enough away that you can see all the stars in the sky & hear all the wild creatures in the woods around you)
-dog-friendliness (Axel & Cujo the resident dogs are always happy to join you and/or your dog while exploring all the acreage of the property, there is a faucet inside just to fill the dog’s water bowl)

The place is clean and everything has been done with a lot of creativity and mindfulness. Jill and Ken Bob are amazing renters is and amazing people. They really make you feel at home and welcomed. Both dogs and cats were so much fun to be around. There are plenty of trails to walk and nature to see. They even let us up a really nice big bonfire for the evening for me my husband and my two kids. It was something like we would never see where we live lol. crepe park nearby is also an amazing place to go whether you are alone, a couple or a family with kids. If you go between May 29th and April 15th you will find a lot of fun things open for the kids to do there. Of course there's a lot to do there the rest of the year as well. The town has everything you need within reach as far as grocery shopping and food. We the Family Affair Diner, Logan's and Route 73 Brew and Chew. Honestly I can't keep going on and on...

Stayed a few nights","This Lake home is a must on your places to stay! Roger genuinely cares about hospitality and his guests. The views from the living room and bedrooms are incredible, the lake was peaceful, and had chef’s kitchen well stocked. Crystal clear and clean hot tub. The groundskeeper comes every morning at 6:30am so there’s fresh water everyday. S’mores by the fire pit and ice fishing off the dock where there was a pre-drilled. We caught some cold fresh catfish and cooked it for dinner. The kids enjoyed all the games, ping pong, puppet theater and the grand piano!
He thought of every detail, for every season."

Group trip","We loved our stay at Roger’s lake house! We were in town for a friend’s wedding and needed a place to stay - this was perfect. Spacious home, plenty of bedrooms, clean spacious bathrooms, and a kitchen big enough for us all to enjoy cooking breakfasts together. The view out the living room windows was the best, we could have sat there all day (and basically did, before the wedding). Comfortable beds, too. We were very happy there. Additionally, Roger was so kind, attentive, and responsive. It was a 5 star stay!"

When we were not out visiting family we were sitting around the table playing cards or curled up on the couch watching football. Roger was very responsive and easy to communicate with.

We absolutely love it here and it’s a pleasure to be back so soon. It’s close to home but far enough away to relax and spend quality time together. If I have any family or friends planning to stay in the area I will definitely recommend their place. They are very responsive to any questions, they make sure you are well aware of all their amenities, and most of all extremely generous, kind and friendly. I can’t thank them enough for letting us make longtime memories here. So, It’s not goodbye it’s see ya later. 🩷"

Tons of outdoor and lake things as well. We enjoyed the kayaks, paddle boats and fishing from the pier. The fire pit was great and stocked with wood. We especially loved the deck and lounging on the daybed overlooking the peaceful and quiet lake. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need. Roger was an awesome communicator, he answered every message I sent within minutes, and checked in on us to make sure everything was to our liking. He gave good recommendations for food and was an all around great host. Thanks for letting us stay!"

Stayed with kids","A peaceful retreat! If you appreciate a lovely (yet homey and comfortable) living space, a well appointed and stocked kitchen(i.e. pots, pans, spices, essential small appliances, coffee, even a community cupboard) we highly recommend you stay at Roger's place!
Fun for a family but would also be great for an anniversary getaway.
There were 8 of us...4 adults,4 kiddos.
We swam(towels provided, even a few floaties/loungers)....but it is a small lake,so recommend water shoes (I wore them but not everyone in our group did) and rinsing off when you get out. There are also two kayaks and two paddle boards that got good use by the kids(9,13,14,15).
Fish were caught(I think I heard catfish and one bluegill), ping pong was played, along with a fun for us baby grand piano!
Rain??There are loads of games provided as well as a fun little puppet show 'stage' and a bunch of awesome puppets for the littles.
Roger is the epitome of a great host...hospitable, responsive and kind.
Thanks, Roger!"

When you walk in the home you just say, ""Wow just wow because of the views!"" This June visit was just another beautiful bonding experience. We cooked all our meals in the kitchen any chef would love, played badminton, went kayaking, fishing, swimming and enjoying the large beautiful dock. The lake is not murky, it has steps on the dock for easy access the whole experience we felt like we were vacationing on our own private lake. Sunrises and Sunsets were spectacular. The master bedroom upstairs has a cozy private deck with cafe table for two to enjoy morning coffee and sunrises. This IS going to be my get-away spot. I highly recommend this home. Thank you Roger."

We actually only live 30 minutes away, so I'm thankful that they shared their beautiful home with us. Our weekend stay exceeded way above our expectations. It's so spacious , clean, relaxing and absolutely gorgeous! There is so much to do from the variety of board games, outdoor yard games, hot tub, 2 fishing kayaks, 2 stand up paddle boards, paddle boat, 2 docks, a fire-pit with plenty of wood to burn, fishing, and a ping pong table! All the extra condiments and food in their beautiful kitchen was quite the surprise, so thanks for the mac & cheese! The view from their deck at sunrise and sunset is just incredible. Their no-wake lake is so relaxing, quiet and safe. They put a lot of thought into their house with labels and phone chargers, what a life saver! I give them 5 million stars, as I felt like I've known the host forever!"

The house is wonderful! The view is so peaceful (with some fun ducks and geese noises) and beautiful.
The house has everything you need…. Games, dishes, pans, cooking supplies, towels, extra linens…. They thought of everything.
Roger is open and honest saying it is a second home….. and when I think second home I think “the place to get away and relax, unwind, and refresh” and it was all that!
Can’t wait to get back there some time.

Group trip","Pretty much spot on, exactly like the pictures! Such a beautifully set up home with a serene, calming view of the lake. Roger kindly communicated everything we needed to know & the house was so clean and well stocked! Labels help guest to be able to relax without trying to figure things out. The house has amazing natural light & so much to offer that we ran out of time before being able to partake in it all. Would love to stay again during the warmer season!"

The very small details and touches showed he genuinely wants his guests to enjoy his home.
There is ample amount of space and the layout made for such an intimate setting to hangout.
Roger communicated effectively and efficiently. I can't wait to book again!"

Stayed a few nights","I would have never come to Freeport if it wasn't for a family wedding, but now I can absolutely see myself making more trips here just to stay in this house! We had two couples staying here for two nights (though there was space for more) and it was perfect. Everything was so convenient. Not only was the house never more than a 10 minute drive from where we had to go, but Roger had everything you could think to need in the house. Every light switch was even labeled which is a small detail that saves a huge headache for guests.
Coming from the city I cannot overstate how peaceful the house is. Waking up on the lake after a seriously good night's sleep already had us planning when to come back. If it was this amazing in the winter I can't imagine what summer would be like getting to use all of the amenities this house has (paddle boards, hot tubs, grills, etc.)
My only qualm was not being able to stay longer. Thank you Roger for being so communicative and accommodating and allowing us to use your home. If you're considering renting here but are on the fence... this is your sign to book!"

There is plenty of entertainment, lots of board games and childrens books and of course, water activities in the warmer months. The view of the lake is beautiful and calming. Roger is a wonderful host, he is responsive and professional and even left a hand written note for us. I've rented over 30 houses myself and a few things stand out here: there are plenty of blankets for everyone for warm and cozy movie nights; the full size mirrors in every bedroom really add a sense of luxury and last, but not least, the layout of the house allowed for our baby to nap downstairs, while our toddlers ran around on the main floor. The bedrooms are stacked and allow for peace and quiet even if kids are being loud in the living areas. It was the perfect place for us and we would happily visit again!"

The home was cozy, clean and bright. The views of the lake are beautiful in the main living room - a spectacular view each morning to wake up to.

Two hours away from Chicago, it sits on a beautiful little lake and has everything you need to feel like you are really ""away from it all."" My nieces and nephews loved the paddle boat for going out on the lake, the daybed for laying and reading outside in the sun, and the bean bag game set was perfect for the whole family. We ended our nights with s'mores by the fire or some quiet time in the hot tub. This house genuinely has everything you need for a fantastic family trip.
But perhaps the best part was the attentiveness and consideration of the owner. Roger was probably the best host I've ever worked with through Airbnb, and it was clear that it mattered to him that our family was enjoying themselves. I can't recommend this Airbnb highly enough!"

Not only did we have an experience of a lifetime but we also got to enjoy the beauty and soul of a what seems like a quickly fleeing gem of a way of life in America, a small generational family farm. Dan and Ashley were responsive, kind and more than accommodating. The home is spacious and clean. I highly recommend the horse riding experience. Dan is a genuine expert and you can tell his love for the animals in everything he says and does. We will be back to see you all very soon!"

We comfortably stayed in a clean and welcoming home with the 7 of us (my in-laws/sister-in-law and son, and my family (myself, my husband/son)) and everyone had plenty of space. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were clean (I would recommend a mat on the shower for a less slippery bath for kiddos!), and the space was open. The lower level floors were heated - which was extra nice in the crisp mornings. It was great too that there was a playset outside with swings/a slide!
The FARM was the best part about our stay, of course. We all loved the interactive farm tour, the pony rides/grooming for the kiddos, and just exploring about (especially when Toby was around - the golden retriever!). Three adults enjoyed the trail ride - it was beautiful scenery and wonderful bonding with the horses.
This really is a special place. We look forward to planning a return trip :)"

We were there for the weekend in the middle of April with 6 kids, all under 10 years of age. We did the farm tour. The kids did the pony rides, and the adults were able to ride horses. The house is super comfortable and cozy. Ashley is incredibly thoughtful; there was nothing that was missing in the house, and we were touched by every small detail: from welcoming gifts of local products, to fully stocked kitchen (including fresh eggs), all type of sport equipments for kids and adults, classic books and movie collection. Dan gave us the tour of the farm and horse lessons. He was extremely generous with his time and our inquiries. We learned a lot about farming and enjoyed the horse ride. The kids milked cows, feed the pigs and cows, enjoyed the chickens, cats, donkeys, the dog and horses. It was an unforgettable experience for the whole group, and we are planing our trip back."

Their farm is very peaceful and welcoming. They were kind enough to let us host some other family that were in town as well for a brunch and a few stayed for the afternoon farm tour.

The hosts were very friendly and super responsive with requests. The coffee pot stopped working while we were there and we had a brand new one in just a few hours.

Dan and Ashley went out of their way to give us the best experience possible. While we didn't take them up on the farm tour exactly, we did have a chance to chat with Kalee (herd manager), Dan and Ashley as well. They were so kind and welcoming. It took every bit of resolve to not hug Ashley when we were leaving. The description doesn't begin to describe what a wonderful experience you will have here. It was a treat to feed the cows and pigs and the plethora of horses was something else. The farm house was pristine and had everything you would need. We slept well and had a blast. I cannot recommend Dan and Ashley's place enough. With little kiddos it was an easy way to spend quality family time together. Cant wait to be back in 2024. We've already shared the listing with at least 4 other families who will absolutely come out."

Stayed with kids","We felt so at home and loved getting a taste of farm life. This was a perfect place for our whole family to get together when they were all visiting us. They thought of everything someone might need and then some.
We loved the tour of the farm and getting a hands on experience with the animals; including horse back lessons, milking a cow, and feeding calves out of a bottle. The staff and the owners gave us a good feel for farm life - a good history of a 4th generation farm and how they respect and care for the animals.
If stay in the area again will will stay here."

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect place for our three families to get away for a long weekend, comprised of six adults and five children ages 2-6! The kids immediately made themselves at home on the play equipment just outside and with the impressive collection of farm-themed toys in the garage (kids love tractors!), and the adults enjoyed the view of the pastures and beautiful scenery from the porch and hammocks! Every single person in our group made at least one special connection with a particular animal...be it horse, donkey, cow, pig, and/or cat. Dan and Ashley were excellent hosts along with their other employees, who were all present and available on the farm and enthusiastic about answering our questions and sharing their knowledge and work with us! All of this made saying goodbye after just three days a bit difficult for us, but we plan to be back. I can't recommend the Dairy at Wegmueller Farm enough!"

Stayed one night","Wow!!
Dan and Ashley's farm is a storybook farm with gorgeous scenery, and delightful animals.
We were looking for a house that's on an ACTIVE farm and we couldn't be happier with our choice. The staff is super friendly and offer hands-on experience into farm life from feeding claves to milking cows. There's also a horseback-riding for an extra fee. It's an unbelievable experience and definitely worth it.
The house itself is spacious, clean, and suitable for larger families. There's also a little swing set and hammocks for you to enjoy.
Dan is an excellent communicator both as a host and as a farm tour guide & instructor.
Our entire family loved our time there."

We loved being around and learning about the animals. We took advantage of the farm tour (learned so much about where our food comes from and how to care for animals) and the kids took short pony rides. We especially loved giving the pigs our table scraps and feeding the baby cows. There was a playground out front that kids lived on. The house had everything we needed and was an easy drive into town for some Swiss meals and even some splash pad time. We hope to come back again!"

Dan and Ashley genuinely care not only about their guests but more importantly their animals, their community, and the environment. They are a successful role model for how the small family farm can survive in a corporate-driven economy while educating on what farm-to-table eating could look like, for the betterment of all concerned.
Their new Equine Therapy outreach will be a necessity for victims of trauma to begin healing however, honestly, this farm is a reality check and therapy for all who stay there. Do yourself and your family/friends a favor- stay here for more than 2 nights and reconnect;take in all Dan, Ashley, and their fantastic crew have to offer!"

The house was roomy (our large family of 10 travelers easily fit into the spacious farmhouse) and there was an assortment of books, games, DVDs, and outdoor toys for guests' use. Our three-year-old loved playing with the metal toy farm tractors and riding the tricycles. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a special surprise--a Welcome basket filled with edible goodies, all of which were from local businesses in Green County. We appreciated the detailed welcome guest book, which included a map of trails around the property. (We took advantage of the trails during sunrise and sunset times for some absolutely beautiful and peaceful walks on the farm.) Even though we are not new to farm life, our kids greatly enjoyed milking a cow, feeding the calves and pigs, and riding the ponies and horses. Dan and Ashley were super hosts and our stay at The Dairy was worth every penny."

Nearby Monroe, New Glarus and Mineral Point were excellent day time trips for shopping, dining and beers. Great weekend away from the city for me and my friends.

One would think going to a dairy farm in the heat of summer (85° plus this past weekend) that the smell would be overwhelming, honestly it was barely noticeable with no trace of the smell in the house.
This time, we were able to bring friends with us who are also planning a trip back. Dan and Ashley offer a unique opportunity for families to reconnect to each other while connecting to the farm animals.
Thank you both so much for such a fantastic and relaxing weekend. Jake is already begging to come back."

The house is very clean and comfortable. You can see how thoughtful and hospitable the hosts are from the supplies they provide: bug spray, bath salt, handmade soaps, sunscreen, and a lot other stuff!
The farm tour was very fun and they are very knowledgeable. The highlight of this trip is the horseback riding. The kids absolutely loved it, and so did we! It is totally different from the commercialized horseback riding experience. You got to know your horses. Dan even matched your horses based on your personality. (Vegas is the smartest horse and Dan told me to be confident and firm with her. I tried but I failed.) it was such a special connection between us and the horses because you are not riding a bike or motorcycle, but animals who are super smart and have personalities. You can also feel the love from the hosts to the animals. They really educated us about farm and farm life.
We will definitely come back when the farm shop is open!"

Group trip","Top notch rating for this Airbnb experience at the Wegmueller Dairy farm!
Dan and Ashley are wonderful hosts, very accommodating, warm and hospitable. The home is spacious with all the amenities we needed. Their passion for their industry and compassion for all of their animals and the environment are clear and makes learning fun. They love to share their vast knowledge and truly serve as ambassadors to the family-owned dairy farms. We stayed in Dan’s childhood home and he personally gave us a tour of the farm which was personal and special. As a 4th generation Dairy farmer, Dan could tell us stories about every corner of the land. Highly recommend this air bnb. There is something for everyone, hang out all day on the porch or under the trees on the loft balcony, read a book, play on the jungle gym, play board games, do a puzzle, have a picnic, take a walk, go horseback riding, feed the animals or head into Monroe for ice cream at Temptation, cheese curds and Blueberry Mules at North Side, antiquing at the various shops or go into Juda for 9 holes at Windy Acres, Green County’s own Field of Dreams golf course. The age range of our family gathering was 18-94 and everyone loved it. Hope to be back next year!
Thank you to Dan and Ashley Wegmueller! 🙏🏻❤️"

We were able to experience horseback riding tours on their land. We also were given a farm tour the next day to see all of the animals on their working farm. Feeding the baby cows and the hogs was the highlight! The house is huge with plenty of space for 2-3 families. It had everything we needed for a long weekend. The welcome basket was a pleasant touch. We spent the day enjoying the property and surrounding farm, cooking out, and sitting by the campfire under the stars at night. This was not just a simple getaway but a whole farmland experience that my family greatly enjoyed. Highly recommended!! The memories that you will make here are worth every penny."

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved our stay at Dan and Ashley's farm!! The house was clean, warm and inviting with many thoughtful touches including local treats to try, bathrooms stocked with shampoo and hand made soaps, and wonderful farm fresh eggs left for us in the fridge. There are great places to gather for meals including a lovely deck where we enjoyed some beautiful sunsets. We also found a well stocked kitchen, plenty of towels and linens , and even a highchair pack and play for our littles. Speaking of the kids, they were delighted to find many books and games to enjoy in the house, bikes and bins of toys in the garage, and a wonderful playset in the yard. The house is spacious and set up in a way that allows for large group gatherings but also has plenty of lovely spaces to separate from the group when you want to.
And then there is the farm!!! As soon as you step on the property you can see that it is well kept and the animals are well cared for but when you take the tour included with your stay, you will find out the love and passion that Dan and Ashley have for the place and get a bit of an education as well! Our kids also loved the horseback riding experience. Dan was so kind and patient with the kids and taught them how to treat the animals in the same way.
All in all it was an absolutely wonderful experience. Dan and Ashley are thoughtful, accommodating and responsive hosts. We made fantastic family memories at the farm. I highly recommend Wegmueller farm and we cannot wait to go back!"

The farmhouse was clean, spacious and absolutely lovely for our family of six. Our kids were never bored; we milked a cow, fed calves (even got to name the newest calf!), rode horses and enjoyed the play set in the front yard.
We especially loved the local touches from Farmer Dan and Ashley throughout the farmhouse. From the handmade soap, local coffee beans, farm fresh eggs and restaurant recommendations listed in a thoughtful welcome basket, every touch made our stay exceptional.
If you’re even contemplating visiting this working dairy farm, stop right now and BOOK IT! The Wegmueller Farm is truly a one-of-a-kind experience!
As we drove down the gravel road to head back home, we all agreed it was one of our favorite trips yet. Next time, though, we’ll send the kids out for morning chores since they woke up with the beautiful country sunrise! We are looking forward to visiting again!"

The house is spacious and clean, very well stocked, and super accommodating. The farm is incredible and very clean, considering it’s a functioning farm. I was impressed with every inch of it!
Our family enjoyed trail rides, pony rides, milking a cow and feeding calves. We got to know the animals, and it truly felt like “home.”
Not only is this by far one of the most beautiful, scenic, peaceful places, but you get to support a small family farm, which is something that is harder and harder to find these days. The Monroe square around the courthouse is absolutely lovely, and the shops and restaurants all have their own little atmosphere. Everyone is welcoming and warm.
Dan and Ashley were superior hosts, and honestly, just good, hardworking, down to earth people.
Don’t think twice about booking. You will absolutely love it here, and you’ll find yourself planning your next trip before you leave!!"

Stayed with kids","Stay at Dan and Ashley’s! I plan my family’s annual fall getaway and the past few years, we’ve visited Door County. This time around, we wanted to check out another part of the state. Luckily, I found Dan and Ashley’s Airbnb! The house easily accommodated our two families (total of 9 people). The beds were so comfortable. But it was the farm that was the highlight! Dan provided a tour on the first day, introducing our family to the calves, pigs and cows, sharing his wisdom and passion for farming. On day two, most of our group (ages 9 to 59!) went out horseback riding with Dan, which was a tremendous experience, culminating in a picturesque ride across the ridge overlooking the farm at sunset. Unforgettable. The next morning, Ashley took us out to bottle feed the calves followed by a milking demonstration with Dan. So fun! Dan and Ashley were tremendously generous with their time, as well as their hospitality. When we opened the fridge, there were a dozen fresh eggs waiting for us, along with a couple bottles of Spotted Cow, locally produced root beer sodas, caramel corn and chocolates. So many fun surprises! I should also mention that in addition to running a dairy farm and interacting with our family, Dan and Ashley were also hosting a pork roast for the community, which they kindly invited us to! We enjoyed our visit to Monroe, but most especially to the farm. My city kids enjoyed every second of our visit. My 9 yo daughter began asking when we’d be back before we’d even left! Huge thanks to Dan and Ashley for a great visit. And, if you’re thinking about staying at the farm, lock it in before someone else does!!"

We were a group of 3 families with 6 adults and 3 kids. Our stay was very comfortable with the various rooms available to choose from. The kitchen was very well stocked for us to cook and enjoy some meals with the beautiful view of the farm animals ( horses, ponies, cows, etc. )
About the hosts and the farm :
Dan and his family are absolutely gem of hosts. From the check-in experience to the farm experiences for adults and toddlers, to all the great recommendations Dan provided to make our visit so much fun, we have been bowled over by the outstanding hospitality and care provided.
We have so many beautiful memories from this stay, and we will definitely get our families back here. It’s not easy to plan a getaway with kids during these times, but working with Dan and his team felt like a breeze.

Stayed with kids","The hype is real; you will have an amazing weekend at the Wegmueller Dairy Farm. With a group of four kids aged 2-6, we never had to worry about the kids running away or breaking anything. They loved the swingset and all of the toys that are provided in the garage. And come night time, they all sat in the basement watching movies and playing games. Since the firepit is out in front, it made it easy to monitor kids wherever they may be. As a parent what more can you ask for!
As far as the experience overall- if you're reading these reviews, then you're already intrigued to bring friends & family to a working farm. That's step one! Once you're there, the rest is up to you. We spent time each day petting the cows, trying to pet the horses (ha) and generally watching the milking process when Dan and Sam were in the barn. Waking up each morning, sitting on the porch, and watching the horses graze in the field is such a relaxing change of pace. The tour that they provide sheds a lot of light on the Dairy industry and was very informative. You can tell that everyone there is passionate about what they do and why they do it, which makes the entire experience enjoyable.
Quick Tips:
1) Definitely take a hike up the hill to the east, to see a great view of the farm buildings and landscape. There is a picnic table up there to take a break at. Make sure to pack extra drinks for the hike, because you'll want to crack open another one.
2) Save your food scraps for Prof. Paisley. He doesn't like greens. Letting the kids feed the pig is a win-win experience for everyone.
3) Ask for Dan & Ashley's recommendation for brats; you won't be disappointed. Support local business!"

House is fully stocked and garage is full of outside fun. Would recommend this trip to anyone! Dan has a great attitude and is very patient with the kids and his youth helpers are also very friendly and helpful. You can be involved as much as you want with the farm operations."

Stayed with kids","Born and raised in bustling Chicago, the experience on the farm was serene and magical. The home is super clean and well-kept. Kitchen was fully stocked with cookware and dishes, which made it very easy to drive 5 minutes to the store and only purchase groceries. No need to buy necessities to serve. It’s all at the home. Washer and dryer was a big plus! With plenty of room to spread out and allowing the children to run around, we were able to wash all the fun off their clothes. They had a blast milking cows, learning and riding ponies, feeding the calves and Professor Paisley (the cutest hog) hee hee. The hands-on experience with the farm animals was unforgettable. You must experience the Dairy Farm if you have children!! Dan offered an exceptional lesson about understanding and the handling of the farm & animals. My 8- & 10- year olds could not get enough. We would have stayed longer, but this great place books quickly. Dan never made us feel as if we were an interruption to his schedule working on the farm. Not once did we feel rushed. We walked away with such an appreciation for the farm. I had to work remotely and was very happy with the Wifi strength—I had no issues with the many zoom sessions I had to conduct. After my work day was done, I was able to join the fire pit marshmallow roasting and watching the sunset. As a first responder, my husband thanked me for choosing a place where he was able to enjoy tranquility and nature. It’s an excellent place to disconnect and reset. Dan & Ashley, thank you for your hospitality and giving us the opportunity to reconnect with our family. Sincerely, Karla"

Stayed with kids","This was our second family weekend at the farm; the first was in September 2019. We were not disappointed and we loved the additions -- hiking trails, horses, chickens, donkeys, two farm cats, and a pig. Dan and Ashley truly love their farm and conversing with guests on all the details of running a small farm including the importance and value of humane treatment of their animals. I highly recommend the new horse experience, Most of all it's a chance to get away from the hustle and bustle of life in the city. You will love the sound of the cowbells as the cows head to pasture, and again at dusk as your group gets together on the front porch while the pleasant melody or the bells and the stillness of the night blend together punctuated by the occasional neigh or bray from the barn. Thank you Dan and Ashley!"

We did the farm experience with the host, Dan. He shared a wealth of information about details of the working dairy farm, gave us a tour of the facilities, and shared hands on experiences of milking a cow and feeding calves.
Dan also gave some in the group a horse back riding lesson. The horses were well behaved for beginner riders.
All in all, our group had a great time. We would definitely visit here again."

Stayed with kids","I took my two daughters on a trip to The Dairy and it definitely rates as one of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had. Dan is incredibly good with the kids and the animals and had a great lesson on the workings of a dairy farm that kept me engaged as well. While it's a working farm and there are people around doing their work, we felt like we owned the farm and had the run of the place, especially in the evening after everyone went home. For the adults, the beds were great and the welcome booklet gave great suggestions for things to do and places to eat in Monroe. A fun thing we discovered by chance was the inside of the courthouse. The courtroom stopped being used as an actual court about 10 years ago or so, but they left it completely intact and the kids can dress up in the judge's robes and use the gavel and conduct a mock trial if they want to.
For the kids, my daughters told me their top 3 highlights were:
1. Horseback riding/lessons
2. Professor Paisley (a very friendly and pettable pig)
3. Feeding the baby calves
I can't recommend this place enough. Dan was incredibly helpful and available to answer all of our questions and make the experience fascinating and enjoyable for all ages."

They had so many extras for us to use that I can’t even list them all - toys, tricycles, games, strollers, etc! They even included some farm fresh eggs. Dan and Ashley are great hosts and allowed us to join them feeding and milking the cows. They also arranged horse back riding for our kids on the farm which was a huge hit. They are both incredibly hospitable. The views were amazing and the sunset over the farm was breathtaking. I can’t recommend this place enough. We will definitely be coming back again!"

There were some games and toys for the kids and gorgeous sunsets at night for the adults. There was a pack n play, as well as strollers and a swing set.
The farm and our time with Dan was what made the trip so great. We got to feed bottles to baby cows and Dan gave our kids riding lessons on a miniature pony. We got to milk Frankie the cow and feed Professor Paisley the pig. Dan taught us so much about the farm and everything that goes into it. He was wonderful with the kids and so so patient and kind.
Kids and adults had a fantastic time. Thank you so much, Dan & Ashley!"

Stayed with kids","If you’re considering booking Dan & Ashley’s farm for family getaway, do it! They were incredibly accommodating from the minute we got there, and the experience was unforgettable. Our family used to own a dairy farm, and we wanted to give the grandkids a chance to experience how we grew up (while also reliving some of our own favorite farm memories). The kids, 2 and 5, absolutely loved the entire trip. We were worried that they might get bored after a day on the farm, but they were up every morning asking to see the cows, calling for the farm cat, and watching the horses graze. They weren’t bored for a minute. Dan’s tour was great for the kids and really, really interesting for the adults (even for those who know nothing about farming!). Afterwards, the entire family fed a group of calves. Our experience there could not have been better. Please support this incredible small business - you will not regret it. Thanks, Dan & Ashley!"

The farm house is beautiful and updated with a fully equipped kitchen where we cooked every meal. The outdoor space is perfect for lazing and just enjoying the surroundings or playing in the playground. The kids spent a lot of time with Dan learning about how to take care of cows and calves, ponies and horses. They fed the animals, milked the cows and rode on the ponies. For a bunch of 5 year olds, it was a slice of heaven. And the parents were just as happy ! Thank you Farmer Dan (from your little friends in Chicago)"

Dan and Ashley are the most welcoming hosts: they made us feel comfortable from the first moment, and let us experience farm life first hand. Our kids loved the animals, feeding, horses, and exploring. The house is a great size for two families. It is clean and has a great set up for meals and relaxation. There is a newly installed playground right outside for the kids to use, and a great area for grilling in front. We took use of the fire pit and porch! The farm itself is very accessible, and Dan and Ashley are warm and will let you participate as much as you want in activity. They were patient and kind to all the kids, and made us all feel comfortable on their working dairy farm. The view at sunset is absolutely gorgeous. This is a great trip to remind you to respect farms, land and Agriculture. We are already planning a return trip!"

Dan and Ashley are incredibly kind and thoughtful hosts, and educators on how a dairy farm operates. We learned a ton and enjoyed every minute of our stay. We spent a lot of time with the animals and learning from Dan and Ashley. The house and scenery is amazing -- I felt like we were back in Napa while relaxing on the hammock on the upstairs deck. It was heaven. My kids said this was the best trip ever and were incredibly sad to leave. (My kids did not say this when we left Disney or any other vacation, for that matter.) My preschool aged son kept telling us he was coming back to the farm tomorrow. If you are looking for a special trip where you can enjoy the outdoors, animals and learning something different or new, do not hesitate for a second to book this one!"

Stayed with kids","Dan and his wife Ashley will give you an experience of amazement and beauty.
Children of all ages will fall in love with the animals, from newborn calf’s, to cows, to chickens, to the patient and friendly ponies.
It was worth every moment to get away from the stress of everyday life and share Dan’s love of his family farm.
Ashley gladly showed us around and somehow managed to tell us each of the cows, calfs, chickens, ponies, horses, and donkeys names.
Coming from someone who can barely remember names of people I have known for years, this alone is impressive.
Dan and Ashley gave all of us a hands on experience of how to milk cows, feed baby calf’s, and take care of horses/ponies.
Their love of animals and what their farm stands for, opened our eyes to an experience that will not be soon forgotten.
My family and I would strongly recommend that anyone, looking for a unique and rewarding experience, immediately book a trip."

Kids enjoyed milking cows, finding chicken eggs, riding a pony, and of course just running around the farm. The house was very clean & spacious and equipped with everything you need.
I especially enjoyed watching cows passing by the house in the evening and listening to cow bells. I didn't know that cow bells have such a soothing sound.
Dan was very accommodating.
He was so nice to share his passion and his knowledge about farming. We could not stop asking questions! We will definitely be going back soon."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at The Dairy exceeded our expectations and offered a relaxing, fun, interactive visit to the farm. As a guest planning a vacation, I consider the following and will comment as such:
*all communication was prompt and detailed.
*the photos and description were accurate.
*the home was expansive and able to accommodate many people. Bed were comfortable, bathrooms clean, kitchen stocked for cooking and baking, with a full laundry room, and tons of games, reading nooks, and places for hide and seek.
*the home was clean and offered every amenity possible - far better than any home we have rented before in terms of paper goods, supplies, bedding and towels, kitchenware, etc;
*hosts, Dan and Ashley, thought of everything a guest could possibly need or want. They made us feel remarkably welcome.
*Dan was a wonderful resource of information, able to answer every question we had about the animals and farm life. He exuded a delightful, contagious mix of enthusiasm and patience.
*the town of Monroe is a close, with a town square worthy of a visit.
*We loved every activity - feeding the horses, riding the horses, getting eggs from the hen house, feeding the calves, visiting with the cows and Professor Paisley, playing tag, and learning from Dan.
Overall, our stay was better than expected; we spent the drive home recounting the fun of the past days and thinking about when we can visit again."

The house is immaculate, spacious, has plenty of space and most anything you could need. We had two families staying together (4 adults, 7 kids) and were totally comfortable. Our kids loved all the fun areas to play in the house and kept entertained even in crummy weather!
Then there’s the farm itself...what a treat! The tour, milking, feeding and horse riding made my kids year!

Stayed with kids","Thank you Dan & Ashley- what fantastic hosts! The property is really special, 9 min to downtown Monroe, and is so memorable. We stayed at the dairy with another family and filled the house with little kids - 1 year old twins, a 2 year old and two 4-year olds. (Pro tip- two pack n plays fit in the master closet side by side!) The cows mooed a welcome as we drove up the driveway to check-in.
The home was clean, had everything we needed and more; the kids loved discovering little toys and puzzles around the house, sliding down the stairs and playing the piano. It’s the perfect place for slumber parties and has lots of nooks and crannies for hide n’ seek. The kitchen had lots of extras, condiments etc. and bathrooms had the basics so we didn’t have to pack them.
But now- the animals! We loved petting the cows throughout the day, seeing brand new baby calves that were born when we were there, milking the cows and learning about life on a small dairy. Our kids took a riding lesson on Little Buddy (a pony) too! I especially loved the pot-bellied pig who rolls over so you can scratch his belly. We can’t wait to come back."

If you're on the fence, I can't recommend it highly enough. We went when it was 8 below zero and we still had a phenomenal time. Our kids had a blast helping milk cows, feeding the babies, and exploring the farm. And there were so many games and fun things to do in the house, we had the best weekend.
The house is filled with personal touches from local products (soaps, coffee, cheese and beer!) which makes you feel like you're truly on vacation. And the house was perfect for our two families.
The whole farm crew was covid safe with masks and cleanliness, which made us feel more comfortable during our stay.
We cannot wait to come back in the summer and explore all the other things the farm has to offer!"

Dan was generous with his time, explaining the ways of the farm and the evolving agricultural economy.

Stayed over a week","Dear Dan & Ashley,

Where to begin ?
From the very first contact you have shown to be very understanding to our needs and requests in a way we could have never thought possible. Our situation is quite unique, but you have taken away many of our worries and concerns by being so flexible and understanding. And that was even before we had arrived at the farm.

Arriving there and staying with you for almost 5 weeks with 2 toddlers and our baby girl has exceeded our expectations in every way.
Not only is the farmhouse very spacious and super clean, it is packed with EVERYTHING you might need. And then there even is a welcoming pack stuffed with local goodies.
Dan & Ashley are VERY responsive and will do everything to help you or solve questions, problems, if any.

The farm is fantastic, we have enjoyed our daily tour to the cows, the calfs, horses and donkeys and the new best friend of our kids: the professor!

A beautiful and perfect place to spend the first weeks with our baby girl and the arrival of
the baby calf that is now carrying the same name as our babygirl is the cherry on the cake.

We have really felt at home and will remember this forever.

Thank you for being part of our adventure. We wish you all the love and luck in the world.

Love,
Thomas, Isis, Tiago, Henri & Anaïs"

Dan and Ashley put a lot of beautiful touches throughout and provided everything we could possibly need. The kitchen was FULLY stocked, there was wood for the fire pit, propane for the grill and lots of little extras throughout. We would have been happy with just the house, but the shining star was the farm. Waking up every day and being able to talk a two minute walk to visit the cows, horses and chickens was such great fun for all of us. We had tons of space to spread out and explore. We went on some lovely hikes and enjoyed all the quiet. It was perfect for COVID times, but I can imagine would be stellar any time. Dan was so responsive and generous with his time. We participated in milking cows, giving calves their bottles, horseback riding and more. Also, they were very respectful of our desires to socially distance and wear masks. Honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better trip and would 100% recommend."

Stayed with kids","Words won't convey the magic moments and unforgettable experiences we had at the Dairy Farm. This trip was a family vacation we squeezed in before summer ends and virtual school starts up again. Since March, I've been striving to find ways to capitalize on the ""new normal"", our post pandemic world and lives. I've discovered beauty in many places but this trip to visit Dan and Ashley's farm was by far the highlight of my pandemic perks.
The backdrop of farm country full of beautiful landscape, stunning sunsets, animals who let you in to their home and space without complaint is only the beginning. This stay was packed full of built in experiences:
- Hand milking a cow
- Joining in the twice daily machine milking, hooking up the machines, dipping iodine, mucking the stalls afterwards
- Feeding bottles to the baby calves twice a day, and I'll spoil the surprise and let you know that holding up a 6 pint bottle of milk for a hungry calf is actually hard work! They are strong babies!
- Rub the cows noses (some like to be pet quite a lot!), and learn what the top of a cow's tongue feels like
- Ride Shetland ponies, either walking for new riders or trotting for more experienced riders
- Learn the song chickens sing as they are laying eggs
- Go for a cart ride pulled by a Belgian Draft horse
- Feed horses, either hay via pitch fork or apples and carrot treats
- Q&A with sustainable farmers, asking anything from how much cows weigh and their body temperature, to what typical vet visits look like, to what their business arrangements are for selling their milk and how they plan to grow their business in the future
The farm house we stayed in had ample space for our family of five, and in fact we didn't use all the beds by far. Kitchen was stocked with all the dishes, pots and pans you need for any type of cooking. Many thoughtful extras including local soap, homemade banana bread, local treats including rainbow fudge, and all kinds of things you might need but forgot to pack, like scrub brushes, plastic bags, scissors, scotch tape, and more. Plus kids books, DVDs, puzzles, and a garage full of outdoor kids toys including a ride on tractor.
But perhaps most importantly, Dan and Ashley treated us like family. They allowed us on to their farm not just to visit and observe, but to be by their sides participating in their daily operations as much as we wanted. We also got loads of time and freedom to explore and discover independently.
I can't say enough wonderful things. I'm so thankful we got to live on the farm, experience the day to day of sustainable farming, to ask as many questions as we wanted, to share something truly special as a family. Thank you Dan and Ashley!"

Group trip","We had two families with 10 people - 4 adults and 6 teens and young adults. We went tubing on the Sugar River and wanted to stay somewhere close by. This place was only 20 minutes away and could accommodate our whole family. I was worried that the kids would get bored, but they loved it! Dan welcomed our family with a tour of the farm. The kids wanted to keep going back to see the animals. There was plenty of space for everyone to spread out and enough room in common areas for all of us. The house had everything you could possibly need. They thought of every little touch. It was also immaculately clean. Which was a plus for me, since I am quite the germaphobe. Any questions I had before and during were immediately answered. We also loved the view from the porch, the hammock, firepit and access to the gas grill for cookouts. We will be back in the fall to see the leaves turn. Thank you so much Dan and Ashley for your amazing hospitality."

Group trip","Dan and Ashley’s farm was absolutely amazing! Our family had not been together in nearly 5 months and it meant so much for us to be able to get together in such a welcoming place. Dan and Ashley were so welcoming and friendly and their communication with us was great. The farm is in a nice quiet location with great space. Being able to interact with the animals was so cool and it just added to our stay. Our 2 year old nephew just loved all of the animals and we never felt that anything was unsafe. The house was spotless and incredibly clean when we checked-in. The house also had anything you could possibly need if you were to forget something. Dan and Ashley even had some free gifts waiting for us in the house which was such a personal touch. We literally felt like we were staying on our own farm. This place is so awesome and it was just the quiet getaway that we needed. We will definitely be coming back to stay here again and we will definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs a quiet getaway. Absolutely amazing hospitality, and we need to support our local farmers!"

Group trip","This is without question the best place we've stayed in. The property was even more beautiful than in the photos, and the house was really tastefully designed and decorated. Dan and Ashley are two really kind and interesting individuals who care about the enviroment and welfare of their animals. The hospitality and availability of Dan and Ashley is phenominal, and the entire farm radiates hospitality, from Leo the farm cat to the cows and horses. The land was spectacular and from the deck on the house the rolling emerald green Wisconsin hills will soothe your eyes as the sun sets and the cows head out for a nightly graze. Would absolutely stay again."

Group trip","Our group highly recommends staying with Dan and Ashley. Honestly, I can't say we've gotten a better experience on Airbnb than from them. They gave us a very in-depth tour of the farm and were incredibly inviting and hospitable. Beyond just the hospitality, their mission of building a sustainable and animal-friendly farm was what really was the icing on the cake. They take care of their animals as if they were family. Their take on sustainability, the food cycle, and not giving into the huge industrialized farming methods will be what brings up back in the future. 10/10 all around."

Group trip","What a great experience for our New Year celebration with our friends. We've been a lot of places in our 30 years of traveling together, and who knew we just needed to visit our local area for such a great stay. The house was a friendly and comfortable place for 8 ""seniors"" to gather in. When I choose a place for the group I usually go for one that has the best gathering space, and with the fireplace and comfortable seating this one ticked all the boxes.
The unexpected delight was the birth of a new baby Brown Swiss that we were allowed to name. Her name is Melody, and say hello to her when you visit. It was a delight talking to Dan and Ashley about their vision for the farm. They are off to a terrific start."

Group trip","Our stay was amazing. We were looking for a place for family from Minnesota and Indiana to meet for our Christmas. The original plan was Wisconsin Dells but we decided to try this place instead and we are all glad we did. Dan and Ashley are just awesome. My daughter fell in love with Zoe and Leo. We really enjoyed listening to Dan talk about the background and future vision of the farm and he was more than happy to take all the time needed to answer the many questions we had. Excellent communication from both Dan and Ashley before and during our stay. The morning of our departure, we all agreed that we need to try and make Wegmueller Farm Stay a yearly event for our families."

Stayed with kids","This was a dream vacation! We had two families staying at the farm house and had such a wonderful time! There was plenty of space for everyone the house was spotlessly clean and thoughtfully updated. We had amazing experiences on the farm including a farm tour from Dan, feeding baby calves (one had been born our first day there and we got to name it), helping the milk the older cows, meeting the horses and donkeys and more! There is also plenty to do in the town hiking, shopping, tours and tasting of lots of beverages, cheese tours. We would recommend this airbnb to anyone going to Wisconsin or looking to get away. We decided to come back next year for sure!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Dan & Ashley’s place, The Dairy at the Wegmueller Farm, was spectacular. Upon arrival the view of the farm was breathtaking. We were delighted to have kind words and treats authentic to Wisconsin nicely arranged in a basket on the counter. Dan & Ashley took us on a tour of the farm. Bottle feeding the calves, milking Frankie and learning the history of the land made us feel apart of the farm. My desire to enjoy prepared food led to an awesome breakfast and dinner with instructions to go from the oven to the table. My life these days is quite busy. Thank you Dan and Ashley for allowing me to slowdown and enjoy everything your farm retreat as to offer.. ❤️"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Wegmueller Dairy Farm was an wonderful experience for kids and all of us. Dan and Ashley are really wonderful and friendly host, they have worked hard and thought through every minute details for their guest. As soon as we entered we were treated with freshly baked cookies and breads, we were three families and all were able to stay comfortably. If you are looking for a perfect balance of country life with modern amenities this is the place. Place is very well kept. Dan and Ashley are very proud farm owners, they offered us the tour of their farm ,introduced their family of 400 girls and they have name for every one of them. We were fortunate to meet one day old calf, they were kind enough to share their daily activities, showed us to milk their cows and explained the details of raising a calf. This is farm is located in a 400 acres land, greenery is everywhere your eyes could reach. We also enjoyed campfire, they provided the woods and every thing needed to lit a camp fire. This place would be very cozy during the colder months with an indoor fireplace & lots of board games !
Thank you Dan and Ashley, we had a great time and can't wait to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","From the moment we arrived we knew this would be a special place. We were greeted by Zoe (one of the two dogs) and a few welcoming barks from Bruno. The home was clean and well stocked including some refrigerated items like condiments, and there was a thoughtful welcome basket with some local products for us to try and enjoy. There was plenty of room for the 8 of us and then some. Our favorite part was learning about the dairy farm. Dan and Ashley and their intern gave us a tour of the farm and took time to answer all of our questions. They are great with guests of all ages (our ages ranged from 2 to 85.) Their farm really is a labor of love and we will recommend this to friends and hope to make return visits ourselves."

Stayed with kids","TL; DR: Bring everyone you know here for a weekend of relaxation, hospitality, and education that's a once-in-a-lifetime experience!
To be honest, my parents are farm people; I am not--or so I thought. I reserved the Dairy at Wegmeuller after a neighbor recommended it as a gift to my country-loving parents, with the expectation that my young kids would get a kick out of farm life while I merely survived. AND I AM FOREVER CHANGED. Ashley and Dan were extremely communicative during the booking and preparation stages, and upon doing some homework, I learned that Monroe is a short drive (just over 2 hours ) from Chicago and a totally different area than our over-explored Milwaukee. In fact, it's just 25 minutes from New Glarus, home of charming Swiss stuff galore and, yes, New Glarus Brewing--maker of Spotted Cow. Upon arrival, we were blown away by the cleanliness of the house and the uber-thoughtful (and tasty) local treats our hosts left. The amount of bath products and towels bordered on insane, and the mattress in the master bedroom was the most comfortable bed I've slept in forever. But enough about the house; let's talk about the FARM.
Oh. My. Dairy.
Ashley and Dan are kind, savvy, brilliant business owners who walked me and my family (ages 4 to 71) through their business, allowing us to hand-milk cows, assist with calf feeding, and explaining the industry's many challenges and rewards. It was truly an honor to spend time with them on their family grounds and get to partake in the farm's activities--they even met us (again) on Labor Day to let my kids milk the cows instead of taking a rare morning off. Their commitment to quality and education is something to be commended, and I am so glad that I am my children got to witness it first-hand. Let me tell you, I will NEVER purchase dairy products the same way again, and I cannot wait to return in the near future. I am so appreciative to have met such incredible people doing such incredible work in the most gorgeous setting. Also, my kids have been afraid of dogs foverer, but Zoe and Bruno the Farm Dogs cured them forever, and now we might have to get one. Or maybe suburb cow, if that's a thing?"

Stayed with kids","The Farm House is really unique. The house is very clean and well appointed. Everything you need is provided in the kitchen, games in the family room, necessities covered in the bathrooms, toys in the garage and even a comfy hammock on the deck. When you want to venture to town, Monroe is charming with all kinds of tasty restaurants to visit and things to do.
The house is just steps from a working dairy farm. What made the trip truly special is that Dan and Ashley are so genuine and warm. They take great care to make the stay personal and customized to what your crew may want. They were welcoming and eager to give us a personal tour of the farm. Our kids were able to feed the young calves, see all parts of the dairy and even help out with chores if desired (sadly ours didn't -- maybe next time!). We even lucked out that a calf was born the morning we left. We were able to come see and pet her and even were able to give her a name.
Dan is extremely generous with his time, knowledgeable and eager to share his experiences both in the dairy business but also all of his other interests too. He is really passionate about having his guests who are interested have an opportunity to learn about the farm. Dan and Ashley have all kinds of plans to offer guests new experiences in the coming months. After a perfect weekend, we look forward to coming back. We will recommend Dan and Ashley's place to all of our friends."

Stayed with kids","A group of old friends (two Sconnies and seven folks traveling from Chicago) met up at Dan and Ashley’s farm on Friday. We arrived to find local treats and a cool home in a hot, muggy day. As the sun set and we enjoyed drinks on the back deck, we heard tinkling noises. Wind chimes? Machinery? Suddenly we saw them - Brown Swiss cows, 50 or so, all heading toward the grass fields as if on parade just for our arrival. Magical. The next morning Ashley gave us a farm tour and we fed the young calves. We spent time exploring Monroe, napping, reading and playing games. Sunday morning a new calf greeted us in the barn, born overnight. The house is beautiful and sparkling clean...a lovely, functional space. I can’t say enough good things about our weekend. There’s a reason they are super hosts. Between the hosts, the farmhouse, the cows, the stars and the lightning bugs, you’ll feel like a kid again."

It was all that Dan and Ashley advertised in accommodations, amenities, experience and more. From being greeted by Bruno and Zoe at the front door, to watching the cows getting milked and learning all it takes to run this operation. It was so fun to watch the parade of cows pass right behind the house in the morning on their way to a day of pasture. Thank you Dan and Ashley for your passion and sharing what you love with us! We highly recommend this wonderful place!"

Our group of 9 had ample space to gather, play, cook, and enjoy each other's company. The rooms were thoughtfully and tastefully appointed, and stocked with everything we could need. Dan and Ashley were the perfect mix of accessible and gracious. We thoroughly enjoyed our glimpse at farm life and came back with a great appreciation for all that goes into the food we so enjoy. Monroe had plenty of fun, eats, and activities and there was no shortage of suggestions for how to spend our time. My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer! Thanks for the great time, Dan and Ashley!"

The house was very clean, comfortable, and spacious for our group of 6. Dan and Ashley were an absolute pleasure to meet and learn from. Their commitment to their farm and animals is genuinely inspiring. Some in our group spent several hours learning about the farm, asking questions, and even bottle feeding the baby cows by hand.
In addition to learning about the farm, we spent time in Monroe and New Glarus, both of which were great, small towns to explore. Lots of cheese and beer to sample! We came from the Chicago area and it was only 2-2.5 hours away, but really felt a world away. The landscape in the area is gorgeous. We’ll be back for certain, and I encourage you to check it out as well!"
