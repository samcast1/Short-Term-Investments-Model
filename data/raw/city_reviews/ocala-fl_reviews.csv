Stayed a few nights","A lovely experience staying at the blue barn! It is a cute space, well located in Ocala and an excellent spot to stay at while we visited the springs closeby. Melissa and Todd are both exceptional hosts and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Feel well rested from our trip which was exactly what we were after. Four thumbs up from the two of us :)"

Stayed a few nights","""My experience at Melissa and Todd's Airbnb apartment was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I was warmly welcomed by Melissa and Todd, who ensured that every aspect of my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.
The apartment itself is immaculately clean and thoughtfully decorated, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. It has everything one could need, including a full refrigerator and a well-equipped kitchen, making it easy to prepare meals at any time.
The bed deserves special praise for its comfort, providing a restful night's sleep. Privacy is also well-maintained, allowing for a peaceful and relaxing stay.
One of the standout features of this apartment is the great parking space, which adds convenience and ease to the overall experience.
The location of the apartment is excellent, with convenient stores nearby for any essentials, and the apartment is tastefully decorated, making it a wonderful place to stay. It's also family-friendly, making it perfect!

Stayed a few nights",Melissa/Todd's place should be the standard! Out of many places I've stayed at this is the 2nd time I bothered to write a review. They invested time money and their vision as to an Air B N B should be. They also kept the place affordable for what they have done. We as guests who have stayed there should appreciate what they have done and help them maintain it as it is so others can enjoy it as well.

Stayed a few nights","This is an adorable airbnb that provides an extremely comfortable stay with everything you need and extremely responsive hosts. Great for an individual or a couple. Very quiet and private, but has a cozy feel. I got a great night's sleep here every night thanks to a peaceful environment and a very comfortable bed. I was in town for WEC, and initially was hesitant about the commute to the horse show being slightly further than I usually book, but the commute was quick and easy and I would absolutely stay here again. Everything is in good working order, the hot water and water pressure were great, and the space is well-stocked with the items you might need. I will be back!"

It's attached to their garage so you might hear the occasional door slamming shut which could annoy some people, but it wasn't during any super early or late hours so wasn't a big deal for us. Friendly host."

After reaching out to Melissa and Todd, they were extremely responsive and very helpful with the requested information. The Bluebarn was very clean, easy to find, and was in the ideal location. The private patio area was perfect for having a cup of coffee and watching the sun rise. Once entering the building, aside from the cleanliness of the space the first thing you notice was the fragrance that Melissa uses, it has a very calming effect on one's psyche. I'm looking forward to future trips down there and being able to stay with such fantastic hosts.

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed an excellent stay at this extremely clean and comfy one bedroom Airbnb.
Communication was excellent and everything we needed was already set up. The place included a convenient private parking place, Wi-Fi, luggage racks for our bags, coffee makers and coffee/creamer/sweetener, excellent air conditioning, a comfortable bed complete with chargers for our phones on both bedside tables, a nice bathroom, a private courtyard with chairs to relax in plus a huge smart TV! I’m sure I’m forgetting something but I know I have zero complaints.
I walked around the neighborhood in the morning and evening to get some exercise and it was quiet and safe.
Ultimately, I ended up working remotely most of the time here but I was comfortable and relaxed!"

This house is located in a lovely, very quiet and safe community where the homes in this neighborhood are all maintained beautifully. We had our dogs with us and went for walks around the neighborhood. Everyone was so friendly! Our host Meridith was amazing from start to finish. She had dog bowls with treats and balls for our dogs. It was little touches like this that made this home so welcoming and comfortable. The enormous very well maintained back yard was WOW! The dogs did not know what to do with all of the property at first but soon had the time of their lives running and playing in the secured fenced yard. The house is absolutely beautiful. It was immaculate and you can tell they spent a lot of time choosing just the right furniture and decor, like a model home. It looks exactly like the photos. I will be back!"

Stayed a few nights",This was my second stay at Roberts. Me and a few of my staff work events at WEC and need a place to lay our head after long days of work. His place is less than 10 minutes from World Equestrian Center and reasonably priced. Robert has been very responsive when I’ve needed something. The only downfall for me: which could be a major attraction to others is: His place is very quiet and not near many restaurants. I tried to find a place to order pizza from and my only option was Uber Eats. It didn’t seem like there were any local pizza places that delivered to the house. So just be prepared to drive a good 15-20 minutes for a meal other than at WEC.

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at The K Way while working at an event at the World Equestrian Center. It was about a 10 minute trip from there and easy to navigate. The property has a gated entrance which is nice. This modular home is nice and spacious and includes many amenities that you might need. It was raining during my stay, so I didn’t get to enjoy the nice backyard with grill, swing, and benches. Robert was very responsive to any issues that I had and I will be back again at this property next month."

Stayed with a pet","I had my cats with me as I was moving across the country and looked diligently to find pet friendly places that would accept them. I got an email after the stay that Robert claimed that there was damage to a leather recliner and he said that my cat had scratched it. However, that is not possible because my cats were contained to the master bedroom at all times. They were taken in carriers from the car to the master bedroom and the door was kept shut (it isn’t good for cats to be exposed to multiple rooms in a new environment - they should be introduced slowly.) It is advertised as a pet friendly airbnb and he knew I had my cats because I had messaged him the day before asking where a vacuum might be located so I could get up any additional kitty litter to be respectful of the space. The recliner already had other damage which he acknowledged because there was already duck tape on it. He wanted to charge me for the damage. I felt sad and wrongfully accused by the host."

Stayed over a week","This Airbnb feels more like a home than a house. It has an open concept with a huge kitchen and living room. The kitchen has anything and everything you need to cook, from a small meal, to feeding a large family. The master bedroom is very spacious with a dresser and walk in closet. The bathtub is absolutely amazing and the water pressure in both showers is the best, AND the water gets hot if you like it that way. There’s cabinet spaces for days throughout the home. It is set up like a mother in law suite with the other two bedrooms on the other side of the house with the other full bathroom. There are smart T.V.’s in every room and the beds are extremely comfortable. The home has a security gate and a long, spacious driveway. There are two screened in areas, one at the entrance and the other on the side of the home, both with seating and a table. The back yard is completely fenced in and very private, as well as always maintained. The body swing was an added bonus for relaxing 😎 There’s seating, a fire pit, and a grill out back, along with a nice sized deck. I was able to order food and get my Amazon deliveries without any issues at all. The owners came and took the garbage cans to the road and brought them back every week. From the lights on the gate, the amazing flagpole, and all the wonderful decorations inside, I couldn’t possibly asked for more. The family is friendly, professional, and communication was a breeze. I will definitely be staying here again and recommend this home to anyone staying in the area! 😁"

The kitchen is huge and equipped with everything you need to cook( spices, condiments,appliances, etc) If you have pets this is a great open place. Having allergies, the dog hair on furniture was a bit of an issue for me, but the beds were clean . It’s a perfect place for a family vacation and we will definitely be back!"

It was fantastic to have two large desks for remote working or schooling, and the internet connection was great. Our kids really enjoyed the swing in the backyard. Definitely make time to go to the WEC one evening to get ice cream at Miss Tilly’s Lollipops, and while you are there, pick up pastries at Emma’s Patisserie for breakfast. La Hacienda is close by for some fantastic Mexican food. Robert was so responsive, answering any questions right away. Definitely the best value in Ocala for a private and comfortable stay!"

Short drive to local restaurants and stores but just far enough to escape the noise of every day life. The minute we pulled into the driveway we saw a beautiful red robin and saw the same little guy as we left. Truly a memorable experience. Even though it was hot during the day it cooled off at night so we could put the fire pit to use and roast some marshmallows for our smores. They were very welcoming of our little 4 legged best friend which really completed the whole experience for us. Soo much to say about this beautiful place but you should really experience it for yourself. I know we will definitely be back again!"

The house provided tons of storage and everything I needed. The best part was the fenced in yard for the dogs to enjoy.
I highly recommend that anyone coming to the area stay here."

Stayed with a pet","Quick review: A home away from home. Truly a comfortable place to stay. Very well maintained, and had everything we needed for our stay.
Bit more detailed review: Robert’s home had everything! From security cameras that made us feel safe in a different town and well maintained perimeter around the home. The yard was very large and my two dogs had a blast running around. The yard is well kept and has a swing that my son loves also! The kitchen had its usual dinnerware but also coffee, oils, sugars, meat spices and condiments in the fridge from restaurants that I assume guests leave. We used and added some in as well! If you’re traveling with kids this is a very safe place to be with them. Besides not having the outlets on the walls covered, Robert’s home is pretty much baby proof! The bathrooms were very clean and comfortable to use! And I’m picky when it comes to using bathrooms. Robert has a Roku TV and if you have other tv subscriptions you can easily log into it. The wifi is fast and Robert also provided a well detailed manual of his home at the entrance - with local restaurants as well. I could go on but overall it was a very nice stay and we’ll definitely love to come again!"

Stayed with kids","My 2 friends and I had a girls' weekend out for a birthday celebration and we really enjoyed our stay at The K Way. The house was as neat and clean as a pin and we felt safe there. The gated entrance was nice, as well as the private backyard. Being dog-friendly, it was also great for a small dog and a pet owner who didn't want to board her.
We enjoyed the fire pit and the grill out back, as well as the swing! I spent my mornings outside in the side screen porch. It's a great place for coffee and a good book (or The Good Book). The kitchen is large and updated, and the electric fireplace in dining room was a great touch.
The house is close to the World Equestrian Center and we enjoyed the Christmas lights and the jumping competition going on during our stay. There were restaurants and grocery stores nearby so we had all we needed for a home away from home weekend.
Bob was super friendly and quick to respond to our questions. Overall, a 5-star stay and we are looking forward to returning."

The king bed was extremely comfortable, yet I will mention the curtains in that bedroom are quite sheer and it was very bright at night. The queen bedroom had nice dark curtains in it. The bath is remodeled and great water pressure in the shower. TVs were easy to use in the living and bed rooms. We had fun listening to the records on the record player while we got ready in the morning."

Stayed with kids","We loved the house. It was just as you saw in the pictures, a historic house tastefully renovated and decorated, and was very clean and peaceful. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen stocked with pots and pans and silverware for basic cooking. Crystal was easy to communicate with and even surprised us with a chocolate dessert and a card for mine and my husband's anniversary. The neighborhood was quiet and had sidewalks we could walk and wasn't far from the historic downtown with restaurants and shops. We were only a few minutes away from Silver Springs where we kayaked. There was a small backyard where my son could play outside and the house felt private and safe. We enjoyed our stay and would like to come back again."

Great location! Short distance to the old historic Ocala area with plenty of food and beverage establishments! Loved the charm of a vintage 1934 home with its many windows providing so much natural light. Crystal was a great super host…ensured we got into the home with no problems and was able to accommodate a schedule change for us which required a later checkout. Thanks Crystal.! Great stay….highly recommend this property and would love to stay here again!!

Great location for access to downtown restaurants and town square area (a little far for the horse show - about 15-20 minute drive - but I knew that going in so no problem there). Had to work while I was there, and the fiber internet was great, especially with all my video calls. Would highly recommend. Had a lovely stay."

Stayed a few nights","This place is out of a vintage magazine or even from an HGTV fixer show. It’s a design & decor beauty!
We chose this bungalow for the location. Near medical facilities for my parents’ procedures and for their quiet recovery. Lovely historic homes surround and provide sidewalks for leisurely strolls. Just blocks from the year-round Saturday morning farmer’s market.
Caveats to know that may help with planning:
There is no microwave. The windows do not open, but central HVAC is sufficiently strong for this cozy home. Shower head has a wand that detaches as needed. Kitchen plates, bowls, cups are plastic & color coordinated with the home nicely. There are 2 short backed rocking chairs and small table outside in the back with an ample umbrella for its southern exposure. The covered carport is wonderful protection from the squirrels’ shenanigans!"

Stayed a few nights","If you like landlords snooping on you during your vacation then this is the perfect place. During my vacation the landlord called frantically and histrionically because my dog was in the home. Within a few minutes, a strange man appeared and began harassing me about my dog. Even though my dog stays in a cage, I offered to pay to steam clean the rugs, which were filthy and had yellow stains when I arrived. The next day I was told the steam cleaning was $500, an outrageously high price. After I checked out, they accused my dogs of urinating on their rugs, which were filthy when we arrived.
I would strongly recommend staying in another place and one where the landlord is not snooping during your visit."

The cottage and the property were beautiful and very peaceful. We did not have the chance to see and utilize everything on the property, but even the little bit we were able to do was great. We joke that we want to be back at the ranch but we really wish we were there. The personal touches (the plant, snacks and wine) was a great surprise and Donanne's personal visit was an added bonus and so welcoming. Many thanks for the comfort and warmth that we felt during this time. It helped so much."

He answered my phone call immediately and told me another road to take so all good. The setting is so tranquil and the cabin is the perfect mix of modern and rustic. Close enough to Ocala to get into town in about 20 minutes, but far out enough to feel like you are in the country. Definitely recommend! Very clean, as well."

Stayed a few nights","After a fun day of enjoying waterfalls and awesome hiking at Rainbow springs, this was a peaceful and luxurious stay at the cozy A Frame! From the beautiful bathroom with spa like shower and thick plush hotel towels, to the comfortable, very pretty main bedroom that leads out to the nice deck with large VERY CLEAN hot tub, we enjoyed our 51st anniversary very much! Abel and Karla have worked very hard to create this lovely cabin and we r thinking Abel is actually Quite an amazing designer and builder as he is diligently working hard on another awesome experience adjacent to this property: A Tree house soon to come! He was VERY concerned about the soft construction sounds coming from the site and was so thoughtful and very apologetic, but trust us on this one, you will enjoy this place and you will even enjoy seeing this future project taking shape in above the trees!
Amazingly clean!! We also Loved Cooking our Steaks on the big gas stove and having wine by the fire at night!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a magical experience. The drive there was as serene as it gets. The property is surrounded with just the right amount of nature and equipped with all that is needed for a glamping experience. From the quaint brick fire pit to the tree swings, it was just picture perfect. The house was pristine. Beautiful bathroom, kitchen and living areas. If you like your freshly grinded coffee, bring your coffee grinds and get ready to soak in the peaceful vibe from your bedroom porch. We don't usually use hot tubs, but this one was so clean we couldn't resist. Real close to hiking paths, Santos trails and a handful of great restaurants. The communication with Abel was superb, very courteous and friendly. HIghly recommend a getaway at the tree house."

There is a gate that you can close if you felt so inclined on the property that wasn’t mentioned. We enjoyed the new set of sharp knives (our biggest pet peeve about air bnbs) for our charcuterie board dinner. We made sure to take a dip in the hot tub and have a fire. I got up at 7am and the birds were singing while I was swinging. Great stay!

The house is steps away from Silver Springs State Park, and there are tons of diners and restaurants to suit all tastes right in the area. Grocery stores are easy to access as well and the CUTE, CLEAN and WELL APPOINTED kitchen made cooking a quick breakfast before heading to the park a pleasure.
The beds were super comfortable, we all slept so well in this peaceful little house (A/C worked great too!!!). And the beautiful outdoor space was a bonus, my kid and husband had a great time kicking the soccer ball around while I relaxed in the covered outdoor space.
Hosts were amazingly responsive every time we reached out, honestly one of our best AirBnB experiences ever, thank you J&D!!!"

Stayed with kids","Joe&Devyn’s home is such a gem! Our family had a great time relaxing on the beautiful property and especially enjoyed the covered outdoor space. The house is beautifully decorated, very thoughtfully stocked, sparkling clean and the beds are super comfy! We appreciated Joe&Devyn’s little touches that also made us real right at home - like snacks and bottled water. The location is very convenient - away from the bustle but a quick drive to many restaurants, Silver Springs Park (which we’d highly recommend) and other attractions. Our hosts were very communicative, responsive and friendly. We’d definitely stay again our next time in Ocala!"

The inside is beautiful decorated with a feeling like home the moment you stepped in. Clean with a well equipped kitchen with your basics and a little extra touch of a treat basket.
If you are looking for a central beautiful relaxing location I can’t recommend their place enough. We live near by and looking forward to be back in the area and will definitely be booking again."

We then enjoyed a scenic drive to the Airbnb and found it beautiful and comfortable! The next day we zip-lined the canyons (only 20 mins away) and ate at Mojo’s down the street. After checkout we had breakfast at Wolfy’s and enjoyed Silver Springs. The cottage has a nice covered area in the back for relaxing outside and the tv is connected to streaming services so you can watch a good movie to end the day. Check in was super easy and the hosts are great communicators. Highly recommend staying here for your visit to Ocala."

Stayed with kids","This house was so cute. Very close to a lot of activities. We came to Ocala for the Canyons Zipline which was about 7 minutes away. We also canoed Silver Springs, which was about 12 minutes away. We dined in the Historic Downtown, which was about 10 minutes away. Also in the area was an arcade, bowling, movies, lots of restaurants, and shops.
The house itself was clean and matched the pictures perfectly. I really appreciated that the backyard was manicured and well cared for - my kids played football until the sun was gone for the day. We also enjoyed the laundry capabilities and stocked kitchen so we could make breakfast before heading out for the day.
Andrew gave easy check in and check out instructions.
We would come back to Andrews if we were coming back to the area (which we hope to!)."

There was also a very small amount of hand soap, dish soap (plenty of dishwasher soap though) and toliet paper. It was 2 rolls per bathroom and less then two inches of soap for each container, but people might be keen on taking these kinds of things so I can see why they would be limited. Small amounts of body wash, shampoo, and conditioner as well."

Andrew was very helpful and the communication was great. There were snacks and coffee and drinks available at the house. The grocery was close enough to run out and grab a few things and cook them up on the grill that was provided. The towels were soft and clean and the beds and couches were all very comfortable. The huge fenced in yard was perfect for my doggie to run aground and safely explore. It was a short drive to historic downtown Ocala as well as historic micanopy. I enjoyed both and hit lots of great antique shops in between. I didn’t know I would be staying in Ocala, so I didn’t have a specific plan, but when I go back, I will plan ahead better and check a few fun things off the new list I have. Thanks again Andrew!!!"

Things like extra plugs for charging your devices in each room and leaving small snacks out were just some of the details that we felt were going above and beyond!
Andrew was very quick to respond when we had questions during our stay.
We would recommend this to friends or family coming to the area!"

We needed a last minute booking on a road trip and were lucky to find Andrew’s place available, so we requested and he confirmed instantly, all with just minutes to spare before arriving. My family was on the road, and tired, and were not familiar with the Ocala area so we had no idea what to expect; Andrew’s place felt like safe haven on our travels. It was well kept and just a comfortable space to unwind after being on the road. Definitely would stay again."

Group trip","The house seems to be newly built and the yard has fence post supplies etc so it really isn’t a usable backyard. The back porch has a grill. There is no fence so there isn’t much privacy if you bring a dog or kids, but for adults just hanging out and grilling it’s not bad since he neighbors aren’t too close. The master bed was comfortable and the kitchen was a good size for making meals. Nice place to book for silver springs! Andrew was very reasonable all around."

The Airbnb had a separate entrance with a lockbox to get the 2 keys - 1 key to get into the home and 1 key to open up the private suite. The accommodations included a private hallway, 1 spacious bedroom with a window A/C & a big screen smart TV, 1 walk-in closet that contained a kitchenette with dishes, silverware, refrigerator with small freezer & microwave. The private bathroom had a deep tub/shower, toilet and vanity with granite top. New luxury vinyl flooring throughout and new carpet in the bedroom. Anna provided a coffee maker, ground coffee, bottled water, sugar and creamers on the covered outdoor patio with seating. I would highly recommend Anna’s Airbnb for a private stay in a beautiful home with beautiful outdoor landscaping. She is a lovely host and I would definitely book her Airbnb when I am back in Belleview. AAA+++ host !!!"

Loved the little automatic lights that lit up when you went to the bathroom at night, both in the hall and bathroom. Walk in closet where I could unpack and put my clothes away, microwave, refrigerator, kitchen cart, coasters on the bedside tables. It really suited all of our needs and provided a quiet and comfortable place for us to return to after a day out.
The location is a little out of the way, but we didn’t mind driving a little extra to this spot. It was quiet and the price was amenable. You really do get your money’s worth. Anna provided us with coffee and towels, she really seemed to think of everything."

The only downside - which isn't the hosts fault - is that the walls are thin, and I could hear any traffic going by, as well as a rooster that started sounding off at 4 am, every 15 minutes, for until I could drown it out with a white noise phone app. So just maybe run the fan or have a white noise app ready just in case this happens. Besides the noise (which probably doesn't happen every night) it was a cute stay and a great deal."

Stayed one night","This was the perfect location for what we needed. My son had a test at the Fire School which was less than a 10min drive. 15 min the other direction was city life- all the restaurants and shopping you could want. The room was very clean, the bed was a Murphy bed so it was a cozy fit for 2 adults BUT the mattress was comfortable! There was a friendly cat that hung out by the walk way! There were a few snacks left for us and a couple of waters in the mini fridge and a nice cold window unit for AC.
Can’t think of anything at all to complain about! Overall I would 10/10 recommend for a brief stay!"

Stayed one night","As an Airbnb Superhost for over two years, AND author of ""8 Easy Ways to Become an Airbnb Superhost,"" I'm a very picky Airbnb customer, but Off the Beaten Path absolutely exceeded my expectations! From the friendly and prompt communications, between Stephen and I prior to my stay, to the clean, welcoming and quiet space, Off the Beaten Path is a terrific getaway, and I'm looking forward to returning on my next trip to the Ocala area. I enjoyed my fave chocolates next to the pillows (how did you know??), the easy peezy coffee maker, the access to extra towels if needed and the the comprehensive Welcome Book with helpful instructions to make my stay more pleasant and enjoyable. By the way, the space is decorated SO thoughtfully and tastefully, it was all very much appreciated! Cheers!"

They thought of every amenity we might need and we were pleasantly surprised at how many thoughtful dog friendly touches they had laid out. My friend and I were at a dog show at WEC for the week and it was a convenient drive and the dogs were welcome. We only spent evenings at the house after long days of showing and the home was so comfortable and the yard with its bright lights was just the thing to let the pups exercise. What an amazing find!!!! Thank you both so much for making a comfortable house available
So far away from our northeastern cold home places!!!!"

Stayed over a week","I should start out by saying I rented this place for me and my mom to use for a few months during the winter equestrian season. Our goals were simple: a nice clean quiet place close to where our horses are at.
The house was in a quiet street with a nice fenced in yard for our two dogs and a split layout giving me privacy as I worked from home. It is not big or fancy but it was very clean, modern, secure and comfortable.
It was close to 200 which has restaurants, grocery shopping and services. It was right off 484 for easy access to I-75 and airports, and it was 25 minutes from WEC the back way; an easy drive.
Renee was helpful but respectful of our privacy. We had a problem with a broken Keuring; she apologized, worked with us on a time to come over and had a new one to us the next day. Otherwise she left us alone.
All in all I would recommend this for a long term stay. It’s not fancy, it’s not right next door to WEC but it is clean, modern, quiet, comfortable and reasonable."

The bedrooms are comfortable. The bathrooms are stocked with everything you could need. The kitchen is well stocked.
The large fenced yard is a delight for those of us with dogs. Renee has supplied a pooper scooper and a bucket to dispose of pet waste, so very thoughtful."

Stayed with a pet","Our dogs loved the grassy fenced in back yard. It was very peaceful and quiet. The only difficulty was using GPS to find the home. It kept bringing us to the back of the property, but we were able to figure it out on our own. The kitchen was well equipped, loved having a Keurig coffee maker, and it had basic supplies for cooking. The water pressure was excellent, and the shower head was better than the one we have at home. I liked the fact that the home wasn't cluttered, and it was very neat and clean. The mattress was hard for my taste but in the end was surprisingly comfortable. There was a notebook explaining the rules of the home along with suggestions for sightseeing and local restaurants including their menus. All in all, it was a very pleasurable experience."

She clearly has made an effort to accommodate and anticipate guests’ needs with extra toiletries, towels, laundry supplies. The garage has a ping-pong table, darts, a disc golf set (there is a course within a 3 minute walk from the house). The neighborhood is quiet, and a huge plus is a paved greenway which is just up the street. It is 2.5 miles, making for an easy access 5 mile walk or bike ride. The property is about 15 minutes from downtown Ocala, and was an easy drive to the Saturday farmer’s market (worth visiting). Shaina is a great communicator, prompt, friendly, responsive.

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warmth and hospitality that set the tone for a fantastic stay. The property itself was a gem. It was well-maintained, clean, and thoughtfully decorated. We felt right at home the moment we stepped inside. Would definitely stay again. Perfect location to enjoy all of the local activities and springs."

Stayed with kids",Shaina’s home is beautiful!! I love the accent wall in one of the bedrooms. The house is very clean with great space. I stayed there for a few hours just so I could rest up before driving back home. Everything was on point until I left. I received a request for fumigating the house due to a smoke smell and was accused that someone smoked in their house. I simply declined it because no one did such a thing. My only recommendation is that they should probably only entertain non-smokers because if someone smoke in their car or outside that scent will linger on them and enter in your home. Other than that I definitely recommend non-smokers to enjoy this beautiful home.

Stayed a few nights",I’ve stayed in many places and this was one of the best. Even better than described and the host was incredibly kind. It felt like home away from home. I will most definitely be back. I thoroughly enjoyed the disc golf park in walking distance. The place was very well cared for and they even have an amazing blender! They’ve thought things through to make anyone’s stay wonderful. The evidence of great hosts is clearly seen in the stay. I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to get away or even to get some remote work done.

Stayed with kids","immaculate, meticulous, beautiful, stunning, perfect are words used to describe Shaina’s Airbnb. Somehow those words just don’t fully describe how amazing the place is, it’s truly indescribable how beautiful and modern the home is. When we walked in and our entire trip our 5 year old called it home. He loved it and loved “His” bedroom and bathroom. Shaina thought of everything, even things you forgot to think about, no worries she has it, and beat you it. We were extremely impressed and what made the lavish home even more amazing was the responsiveness of our host, they answered all our questions almost before I finished typing them. Speak about anticipating your needs and giving what you need, that’s the definition of Shaina’s Airbnb. My son and daughter loved playing with all the toys, and he wanted to play ping pong, I promised him, we can on our next trip. Anytime we are visiting family as we did for Easter or going to Silver Springs we know where we will be staying. **5 stars**"

She has a list of recommendations, fully equipped kitchen (I cook alot so this is important), kids toys, cards, all the things. Ohhh something I’ve never mention but I feel is important… she doesn’t have you clean the whole house when you leave! I mean sometimes you have to catch an early flight or whatever and houses like this should be recognized for the ease of check out. Anyways, I highly recommend:)"

After driving for 2 days it was nice for us to stay last minute in the house and allow the kids to be loud and have room to move around. She had toys and games for the kids to keep them busy in the morning, allowing us to sleep a little longer. We would definitely stay here again!"
