Group trip","This house is so wonderful. From the top-tier amenities like the rain shower or the coffee pot to the incredible spaces on the property (for us, the deck and kitchen were highlights!), every detail here is so thoughtful. A really wonderful, calming space for gathering with a group."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Morgan’s home to visit family and it worked out great for us. Morgan was very communicative and responsive. Very spacious home. It looks like it may have once been zoned for a business and was rezoned and remodeled as a rental. One thing to point out is the first/main bedroom is off of the “vestibule” for lack of a better word. It worked out fine for us as a stay or adults; however, if I had my young kids with me I’d need to make sure that none of them had the front room for safety reasons.
It is quite accessible, which was nice for those on the older side.
Overall we’d stay here again. Great location, clean space and communication was excellent."

Stayed a few nights","The house was exactly as pictured. The rooms were pristine, linens were incredibly soft. High end toiletries were provided. An unexpected and appreciated touch included a variety of coffee and tea along with some snacks. One of my group forgot to bring a toothbrush and there were some provided for that purpose.
A huge private deck overlooks the back yard and despite the rain, we were able to sit outside to drink our morning coffee and stay dry. We only had a short drive to area attractions. When I had a question, Morgan responded within minutes. This truly is a Zen house and I would stay again. After checking out, Morgan reached out to ask if there was anything that needed to be addressed or improved. That shows how important it is to him that his guests are comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","Our experience at The Zen Ranch was outstanding. Morgan was friendly and always quick to respond. He gave clear and concise instructions. A wonderful host. The house was beautifully decorated with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We particularly liked the the small luxuries that were provided like a well stocked spice cabinet, the aroma atomizers, the echo system to provide music throughout the house, and the terrific selection of teas and coffees to try. Because of Morgan's attention to details, The Zen Ranch is a peaceful, beautiful and relaxing house that makes you feel right at home while you are enjoying a 5 star vacationing experience."

There are very thoughtful details throughout the home that let you know your comfort and experience are of utmost importance to the host.
Every single room in this home was easily accessible, aesthetically pleasing, and comfortable.

Stayed a few nights","The inside of the house is absolutely beautiful. A+++ on the remodel. Zero complaints there. Host was super easy to work with & extremely responsive. A couple things that was a bit not great: it's on a super busy road and really close to the street for that matter. Not an issue for us but you will have zero privacy in front & def won't let your kids out front unattended. The front of the house has been remodeled with wood beams and looks awesome in the pics but sun / rain has really taken it's toll. They need to be replaced ASAP. Again, not an issue if you're just hanging out inside. Back patio is ok. You'll need to bring firewood if you want to use fire pit. Big back yard, no privacy though bc it backs up to massive apartment building. The biggest shock was the massive 5 car garage that's falling apart (busted out windows, etc). My kids actually liked exploring around it with flashlights but that certainly was out of place in otherwise beautiful home."

Stayed with kids","We were in town for a volleyball tournament at Rise Sports Center. This was the perfect location for all the events. We had people in our party ranging from 9 months to 78. The accommodations at Zen Ranch was perfect for everyone. One of the best features is the layout of the home. There are areas for everyone to come together and yet everyone had their own areas to retreat. Morgan has anticipated the needs of everyone. He included a lot of extras that made your feel really at home. I can't recommend this property enough if you are going to be in the area. Also, the price is definitely worth it."

Group trip","We loved our stay at the Zen Ranch! My family of five, including our three grown children, had plenty of space to relax and spread out. We also very much enjoyed the deck and patio out back. Morgan made check in a breeze and provided numerous recommendations of places to eat and things to do, which was especially helpful. We tried two of the restaurants on the list and loved them both. The amenities provided in this house were also top notch. We were in town for a formal wedding, and our dress shirts got very wrinkled in flight. I had a high quality iron to use (a detail that often gets overlooked these days) to touch them up and the shirts were perfect again. We would stay here again!"

It was beautiful, clean, spacious, had lots of amenities (shampoo, conditioner, laundry detergent, etc.), smelled good, and had fun things to keep the kids entertained. The kiddos loved the Sega video game, singing bowl, and the bean bag bed. Thanks for making it such a great stay, Morgan!"

Stayed a few nights","Superb Airbnb and host! Our family was delighted and impressed with everything about this home and the host. First of all, we had unique needs as we were traveling with a wheelchair, and Morgan answered many questions beforehand to help us feel comfortable that the home would be accessible for that person in particular - and it was! Morgan was extremely responsive when we had a question, although his house manual and instructions didn’t leave room for many of those:). The home is uniquely laid out with plenty of open space inside and outside and room for getting together, nice areas to watch tv, state of the art electronics, beautiful and unique design features, comfortable, clean clean clean, and just lovely. Nice coffees, snacks, and treats, quality coffee maker and hot water pot, new washer and dryer were provided as well. We will definitely be back and will be sharing with friends. This is one of the top two airbnbs we have stayed in. Thank you for your hospitality Morgan!"

I was AMAZED at the number of items he had there for use to make this feel more like home. Thank you so much for your beautiful home and such clear instructions on how everything works and is used."

The house looks just as good as it does in the photo, and the little touches that Morgan adds make it feel incredibly welcoming rather than just another soulless Airbnb.

Great kitchen equipment, loved sitting outside on the deck, and his little coffee bar was something I’ve never experienced before with a rental.
The bed in the back bedroom was probably the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in!
If you’re looking for a house that feels like home then consider The Zen House!"

The layout of the house was really great and allowed everyone to have their own space with room to hangout together in the kitchen and living room.

The place is very quiet and cozy, spacious and well equipped. The beds in all the rooms are great! The bathrooms also caught our attention. The laundry room is well equipped and spacious. The kitchen was the common area we used the most.
We went during a very rainy period and were unable to use the outdoor area behind the house. It's a shame.
Mr. Morgan was very attentive and promptly. Always very concerned about our well-being in your property.
It couldn't have been better. We hope to return soon."

Being an older property that's been renovated, it can be a bit ""drafty"" if it's really cold outside (which it was when we visited) so plan accordingly if its going to be cold weather. The location was excellent as far as getting to nearby restaurants (not really walkable though) so Uber or driving is necessary (which was fine for us). Morgan is an excellent host and was very responsive to questions. Highly recommend this property (unless it's really really cold weather :) )"

Both times Morgan was super communicative and helped us both times with questions about WI-FI access and even somehow managed to get his broken HVAC changed out at the last minute before we checked in - he has proven himself to be amazingly helpful! We love the big back yard and fire pit area to hang out. The large kitchen worked well for feeding all of us hungry guys and room enough in the living room to watch our Works Cup games too. The team has unanimously voted to use this as our official team ‘home away from home’!

You can tell they put a lot of thought into making a very accommodating space. It was clean and well laid out and in a great location (I was born and raised in the area).

The place is well laid out, so you could easily have two families there with plenty of room and privacy. The location is excellent, being close to Clemmons and Hanes Mall Blvd. So there are plenty of restaurants and retail close. I highly recommend!"

Morgan has done a terrific job renovating the place — it’s a great mix of luxury and character. The main bathroom in particular was amazing.
The house is very clean and well-maintained.
The house has an easy-to-use alarm system that provides great peace of mind.
It’s in a great location — close to all of Winston-Salem’s major points of interest.
Morgan is the most responsive and helpful AirBnB host that I’ve encountered.
All the furniture is great — especially the beds!
It’s very easy to work remotely from this place — fast internet, comfortable desks, and comfortable chairs.
I highly recommend Morgan’s place!"

Group trip","ZEN RANCH LIVES UP TO IT’S NAME!
This is the perfect home for hanging out with family and relaxing or not. Nothing is overlooked. The more I looked around, the more I found. Everything you could want or need was anticipated and provided. Neatly tucked away or elegantly displayed. The kitchen, bathrooms and laundry room were well stocked. The place smells fabulous and is sooooooo very clean! The beds were comfy cozy and there are plenty of soft blankets for snuggling up on the sofas, beanbags or large cushioned chairs. We couldn’t use the lovely outdoor area because of the rain but it had nice lighting, seating and a grill area on two levels. Last but certainly not least… The Zen room! A peaceful room with yoga mats and everything you need to just totally relax. The home is tastefully done and has it all! Morgan is also quick to respond and a great host. Perfect Airbnb!"

The place is just enough out of the way to be private but close enough to the main part of town to get anywhere quick or get food delivered. This will be our first choice for accommodations when we visit Winston Salem. The home is modern & has a spa feel to it. We looked forward to coming back in the evenings after visiting the parks & children’s museum during the day. Great place for kids. We played almost every game they had on hand.

Kathleen provides so many little details that make a trip even more special; a washer/dryer, a well equipped kitchen w/ lots of dishes/ pots & pans, the most comfortable bed, and bed linens, and soft towels & extra toiletry items. Also, the alexa device was nice for constant music, a keurig w/ available coffee pods, and a bottle of wine she left for us were so appreciated! Kathleen was also so friendly, & immediately available to answer any questions I had, and has a very helpful guidebook that gives ideas on things to do in the area.

On a sunny day, I would eat a snack on the balcony with my music playing on the Echo device, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the sight of birds playing just beyond my reach, treating me to a second music. Then I'd put on my hat and head down to Old Salem, where I enjoyed the sights of historic buildings and colorful landscaping while I stretched my legs. You kind of sink into the bed, receiving it like a hug. The neighbors would say Hello, and the place was quiet enough to never know there even were neighbors. I particularly liked the easy access to the kitchen from the sitting area, where I would wind down at nights, drinking iced decaf coffee and eating sorbet (the freezer and fridge are high tech and provided excellent cooling and ice-making). The slanted angle of the main wall with windows is a nice touch of personality."

Stayed with kids","The location and accommodations were beyond excellent! We were in Winston Salem for a weekend to provide a little special time for our youngest granddaughter. Kathleen informed me ahead of time that this unit is typically rented to couples and not children. She wanted us to be sure that we understood that it wasn’t child proofed or set up for children. We understood. And we appreciated the acceptance.
The unit was extremely clean. There were snacks, water, wine, coffee and many basics provided for us. Additionally, there were plenty of linens and we had access to the cleaning supply closet. The unit had a modern and efficient kitchen with all of the essentials. The bathroom and bedroom were also as described with a gracious closet. The washer and dryer allowed us to do some unexpected laundry.
I can’t say enough about the location. It was excellent for visiting the downtown childrens’ museum and old Salem! Parking was convenient.
Communication was great.
We highly recommend this unit and Kathleen’s hospitality. Thanks."

It is a 5 minute walk to the Old Salem Museum and Garden and very convenient to downtown and all the great restaurants. Kathleen is a very responsive and proactive host. My husband and I would not hesitate to staying at Kathleen's if we visit Winston-Salem in the future.

A Keurig coffee maker (cups included), a regular drip pot (decaf grinds were there), spices for a simple meal prep, snacks (snack bags of chips, granola bars), a bottle of wine and some water bottles too! There were plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, laundry soap, cleaning supplies, dishes and even an ice maker in the freezer (my husband is an ice freak). The entire building was safe, clean and quiet. Parking was ample. We have a rather large truck and there was room for us too. You can easily walk to Old Salem and the Farmer's Market across the street is great. We got some nice pastry there for breakfast. Some things we enjoyed were Old Salem, a Ghost Tour, Antique Shopping Mall, RayLen Winery, Reynolda Village, the Shell Gas Station, Mast General Store, Quarry Park (bring a lock to leave behind as a memory), ate at Cin Cin Burger Bar, Finnegan's Wake and Omega House (surprise little place) to name a few... When we return to Winston-Salem we will check for availability here first for sure! Thanks Kathleen for a wonderful experience!"

The apartmet is fabulous, spacious, comfortable, spotlessly ckean with everything we needed and more. A half bath!!! Wahoo! Kathleen and Brent are THE best hosts, communication was always super prompt and they certainly go above and beyond to make sure you have a perfect stay. There was even a bottle of wine waiting for us when we got there🍷🍷
An ideal location to explore the mountains, Old Salem, downtown and Lake Salem. The Farmers Market is right there on Saturday morning. There's cycle paths everywhere and it's a super safe area.
We had a fantastic 9 night stay, really enjoyed all the local breweries and the restaurants we tried too. West Salem Public House is a short walk or cyle away and well worth a visit. We love Indian food and both Mystic Ginger and Nawab serve up some delicious food with amazing service. Nearby Willows Bistro is a great spot. The people in Winston Salem are increidibly friendly and will be very happy to have a chat and share advice on the best places to go.
And if you're looking for a fun and inexpensive way to spend a few hours head to Smiley's Golf and Learning Center for a couple of rounds of mini golf ($6 for unlimited) and hit a bucket of balls on the driving range, even if you never held a club before.
Thanks loads Kathleen and Brent, we'd love to come back, and won't even look anywhere else as long as you have availability."

Unit is just as described and pictured - very clean, open, very comfortable, plus lots of little touches the owners provide to make you feel at home.
Response time from owners for any question is quick and helpful.
We had one small problem and they responded immediately, were over right away to fix it.
Owners respect your privacy but seem to really want you to feel welcome.
Was there for daughter's graduation from WFU, and all the usual hotels were full, so I looked on Airbnb - so glad I did, and wish I'd know about this place sooner - Thanks Thao!"

They helped me up the steps and into the room the day I had surgery and even make my mother and myself some amazing chicken soup for dinner. The word has changed in so many ways since I was a kid, but their kindness reminded me that there are still some great people out here! On top of that their place is super cute, clean, and smelled like heaven. I will definitely rebook with them if I have another stay in Winston! Forever grateful for this experience ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","This place is lovely. Clean, bright, quiet. Very homey and comfy. Rooms spacious. Very close to the university. The bathroom is lovely, and the bedroom well appointed.
The only thing to note is the 'kitchenette' is a kitchenette-ette. In other words, it doesnt really exist. Yes, there is a mini fridge, and a coffee machine and microwave. Thats it. No tap - have to get water and wash in the bathroom. There is not really proper cutlery or plates or bowls there - not big enough to say have a muesli for breakfast. There is no cutting board or knife, so you couldnt cut a loaf of bread, and no toaster. So its really only designed for takeaways."

The couch is more of a love seat and can’t be used for sleeping. So it only accommodates really one person or a couple traveling together. But otherwise the stay was great!"

We loved the location, a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood on a very spacious green grass lot, She had a coffee bar with tea, cookies to bake and other treats, (which my grandkids enjoyed). One issue which was challenging for me were the steps that you take to go down a bit to your residence, that did not have a hand rail. Most people would be fine, but if you have balance issues, or struggles with mobility it might be difficult. All in all it was a very pretty, very enjoyable place to stay!"

Very continental feel to this efficiency. Luxurious features throughout. More space than I expected from the pics. Although it has only one window, we never felt “enclosed “. Maybe it’s all the landscapes and nature photography through out… clever design!
Terrifically accommodating host, helped us extend stay.
Note, as described by host, it is accessed from sloping gravel path, down a few steps, from driveway/parking. Might be a challenge for some with limited mobility."

Adorable guest sweet, comfortable bed, swivel TV for unwinding on the couch or in bed, great snacks, and a binder full of recommendations for exploring the surrounding area. Location is very convenient in a quiet neighborhood with just a short drive into Winston Salem. The bedroom is fantastic for those days when you just want to sleep in, as very little light gets in from the back door - just make sure you set an alarm so you don't end up sleeping through the day! Multi-form-factor charging cables were also provided at each night stand, which was a great touch for those who also tend to forget phone chargers at home - I've never seen that anywhere else!"

Not only is it a beautiful place and beautifully decorated, with a beautiful garden area, the unique personalized touches make Emily’s place so special.
It really is a home away from home and my wife and I felt so welcomed, there is everything that you would ever need for a comfortable stay here.
We stayed here on a long drive from Florida to New York, we were really exhausted and having trouble booking through air b&b. Emily went out of her way to help us book and her communication throughout the stay was incredible.
The bed is amazing, we even accidentally slept in but it was so worth it.
The town is beautiful, lots of lovely places to eat and a big grocery store.
Emily, we can not thank you both enough for the lovely stay that we had and we can not wait to come back for a second stay.
If you are reading this and wondering whether to book, you definitely won’t regret it. We only wished we could have stayed longer.
Thank you so much again for everything."

From the smallest of details every room in the place was made for comfort living. We didn’t want to leave! Be prepared to relax, enjoy the snacks and settle in to pure tranquility. The treed backyard and outdoor sitting area only added to our little “getaway” from our normally hectic schedule.

Stayed a few nights","Brad’s place was perfect for me to visit my daughter at Wake Forest University. Great location right next to campus, Renoylda Village, walking trails and restaurants. The apartment is super clean, comfortable furniture, everything you need in the kitchen and plenty of room for two. Brad was a great host, although we didn’t meet, I’m sure if I needed something he’d be available. Don't hesitate, it’s perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","Brad and Michelle were absolutely excellent hosts, the apartment is excellent, and my stay was fantastic. The apartment is so well kept, and perfectly cozy. The furniture is comfortable, the kitchen is functional, the bathroom is spacious, and the apartment has all the amenities you could need at your fingertips.
One huge aspect I loved was being able to park in the garage - great perk!
The area around the home is so excellent as well - safe, great restaurants right nearby, and walkable neighborhood areas and Greyland for a relaxing walk near as well.
There are great recommendations given by the hosts as well -all spot on.
I was able to get lots of work done, visit friends, go hiking, and explore the area all while being able to come back to a relaxing and wonderful space.
Overall just a fantastic experience and great hosts! Great recommendations and fantastic stay. Hands down, I'd be aiming to stay here again on my next visit.
Thanks so much Brad and Michelle!"

He also left lights on for us, which was welcoming and helpful. The studio itself is absolutely lovely. It is beautifully furnished, cozy, and has the most comfortable mattress and bedding. We were able to go on a long walk one evening and felt completely safe and enjoyed looking all the beautiful homes and landscape. We had the chance to meet Brad; he brought us some eggs from his chickens to use for breakfast and he is very friendly. We can’t wait to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Brad is a fantastic host! He's helpful and responsive. In our case, he was able to provide help above and beyond what most guests might expect.
The suite was perfect for us. It was clean and well stocked. It was not a huge space but it was large enough for me 6'6""+ and 260lbs. In fact, it had two things I always request: 1) a high shower head + hand-held shower head; and, 2) a king size bed.
If I had to give a ""heads up"" for anything, I would give a MILD caution about four things (just as high shower heads and king size beds are a dealbreaker for me, the following cautions may be important for someone else): 1) the kitchen is nice but on the small side. That was not a problem for us because we rarely needed more than one person in the kitchen at the same time; 2) the water pressure in the shower suddenly dropped once when I was taking a shower. The water pressure was never terribly strong but it was not weak enough to bother us; 3) the staircase entering the suite is steep with small steps (for someone with big feet like me) and has a 90 degree turn about two-thirds of the way up. This could be difficult depending on your physical status; and, 4) the entrance gate to the property is opened and closed manually and is tight if you only open one side. We were driving a Tesla Y and it just fit (the mirrors were close). A large vehicle would require both gates to be open. Also, it would be a real pain if you are driving by yourself (it was raining almost half the times we were coming or going.) Finally, the space between the gate and the road is narrow. Our car barely (and I mean barely) fit. The road is busy and though there is an extra lane that really should offer you a little spare room it rarely did because many drivers would race down the extra lane, using it as a normal lane even though it was clearly marked for cars turning right.
Again, I want to emphasize these were not major problems for us. We were easily able to manage these idiosyncrasies of the property. Every property is bound to have something about it that might be a dealbreaker for someone. This was not the case for us.
We loved our stay at Brad's place. We thought Brad was an amazing host. We would gladly stay there again and highly recommend it and him to others!"

His place checked all my boxes, safe, clean, comfortable, quiet and convenient to everything! The bed was dreamy comfortable and I thought I would miss having a couch but I didn’t, the lazy boy chairs were great. The full kitchen had everything I needed and Brad was kind enough to welcome me with snacks and drinks too. The private garage was a bonus as I was never worried about my safety when I worked late hours coming and going to the hospital. I would highly recommend Brad’s place for a weekend or an extended stay! If I had to ding him on anything I would say the water pressure in the shower is pretty weak, but not sure what can be done with that."

The suite is clean and roomy, Brad left us snacks and drinks, wonderful place relax before a great shower and comfy bed."

Stayed a few nights","Brad’s in-laws suite is located in Buena Vista, a very exclusive neighborhood in W-S. It’s charming, quiet and conveniently located to everything. It’s is very clean, comfortable and it has lots of amenities. Brad and Michelle are very kind, hospitable, very accommodating, they go beyond the call of duty to stock the refrigerator, pantry and bathroom with drinks, food and toiletries, their attention to detail is remarkable!. This place not only feels like home, they treat you like family and giving it a 5 stars won’t do any justice, it’s more like 6 or 7! Staying here is better than any hotel room in town, we enjoyed our stay, highly recommend it and can’t wait to come back, this is “southern hospitality” at its best!!!"

It’s spacious but feels cozy. Brad was super responsive, friendly and helpful. I look forward to many future return visits."

From the beginning Brad was extremely friendly and accommodating and the time while we were there was better than what we could have asked for. First of all the place is in a great location in the middle of a safe neighborhood. You get your own garage space and when it poured on me one night when I had to go get something it was extremely nice to not get drenched. The apartment is very nice and had all that we needed for our stay. Not only is Brad great to speak with but his wife and kids were extremely friendly also. We had a 1 year old with us and they treated him like he was part of the family. There is no reason to stay in a hotel anymore if you are in the area because there is no comparison to staying here.

Group trip","Our family spent 2 days over Christmas in this special space. If you have an appreciation for the woods, history, antiques, & rustic charm this lodge will be a feast to your senses! You could easily spend an hour walking through the house & taking in all the memorabilia - rotary phones, unique light fixtures & furniture, pictures, pottery, an old violin. Many welcoming touches like fresh flowers, a bottle of wine, & a coffee bar. Originally a hunting lodge, it has been restored beautifully, & was very comfortable for our family of 5. With 2 heating zones, temps were never a problem. All of the rooms are large, immaculately clean, & many had fireplaces. The beds were comfortable, towels soft. It rained during our entire stay, so it was nice to just hunker down, but it also meant we couldn't enjoy the large porch. The only drawback I can see to the house is that many of the rooms are on different levels with a few steps in between, this could be a problem for folks with mobility issues"

Stayed a few nights","Meagan & Wade's cabin was one of the best Airbnbs in which we've stayed. We hosted a very small dinner with my in laws and some family at the cabin. My in laws actually live righat around the corner. Everyone was blown away with the fact that this cabin was tucked away right there in the city. The location feels like you are away in the thick of the mountains; however, you are close to restaurants, grocery stores, etc. For us, this was the best of the both worlds.
The cabin was spotless. We spent several minutes walking around in awe of the level of historic details throughout the very spacious cabin. The outside of the property lends itself to outside exploration. There is a fire pit, corn hole game and lots of outdoor seating.
We were able to meet Meagan. She was very friendly, warm and welcoming. She answered any questions we had. We will absolutely be visiting the cabin again!"

Stayed with kids","We LOVED our stay at the cabin. We were staying with our family from Florida and visiting our son at Wake Forest. The location couldn't have been better for that. We just loved the charm and unique character of the place. It felt like home and had just the right amount of furniture and decor. Not cluttered but enough to feel homey. I really just can't say enough about the place. I loved the adorable kitchen, beautiful dining room, cozy TV room, and the adorable fixtures throughout the house. Faucets, lighting, etc. It was very quiet at the cabin. I'm a light sleeper and I had no trouble sleeping. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was fantastic. We hope to stay there again."

The grounds feel secluded and the many azaleas were in full bloom. There was plenty of room for all three generations to spread out. My son was particularly fascinated with the old style rotary phones (decoration only). It's an older home so, be prepared for that- The pipes sometimes rattle and the floorboards sometimes creak. The house has a lot of character but people who prefer everything to be shiny and new should stay elsewhere."

Meghan allowed us to have the family over for a get together, there are 5 brothers and families, plus grandpa. There was enough room for all of us to spread out through the house, porches and fire pit. My daughters also really enjoyed the cabin. My husband saw deer in the morning and we saw bunnies too. There are 3 full baths, a huge living room downstairs and a comfy den upstairs. The kitchen is a nice size with all the amenities. The kids enjoyed making s’mores on the fire pit. The dining room is huge! It easily seats 10 and we brought 4 barstools in and still had enough room. There’s also a big back porch with rockers. My husband’s grandfather lived only a few doors down when he was growing up so this area brought back lots of memories for the brothers and their father."

Within minutes of sending a question, we would receive a response and that continued throughout the stay. The house is spacious, yet extremely cozy as well. Plenty of room in the kitchen, a large dining room, and living room with a fire place. We spent lots of time around the fire pit outside, and found this location to be exactly we sought after. A trip to pilot mountain, a visit to the Reynolda Musuem, were just a couple outings that added to the enjoyment of the stay. We would definitely visit again, if we end up back in Winston Salem in the future."

Stayed with kids","FIVE STARS!!! This was a 1st for my Family and I to rent an Air BnB property. Meagan & Wade made it a wonderful experience. As past guest has said, and is true, the pictures do not do the cabin justice. It is a beautiful space tucked away from the everyday stresses of life. My family and I love to travel and with everything going on we have not been able to do so. We wanted to celebrate my Fathers Birthday and wanted to get together as a family without large crowds. Meagan & Wade went above and beyond what we expected a host to do. Everything was in its place and they provided “just in case you forgot or needed” items that added to the ambiance of the property. We even caught deer wandering the grounds early in the morning which was really relaxing as we started our day. You truly get lost in the cabin with all the history, the library and overall feel of the Cabin. We would absolutely recommend Meagan & Wade as host for this property.
Thanks again Meagan & Wade for everything!
PS I hope you found the notes that our daughters age 16 and 11 left for you throughout the cabin!"

Stayed about a week",Meagan and Wade’s cabin is an exceptionally charming retreat. Their communication and accessibility is second to none. We ended up staying here for several weeks while we were relocating to the area and it turned out to be a fun adventure. The fireplaces add such character to a house filled with generations of stories. This place really is a sanctuary in the city. Recommend to anyone that needs to get away and still be connected/close by to the Triad!

Group trip","This place is a hidden gem right next to wake forest. You could not feel more like you are in the middle of the words but only two minutes from being in the city. Incredibly spacious with an authentic old cabin feel. Our host was immediately responsive before and during our trip and I knew when we got there it was going to be everything as advertised! We made s’more‘s in the fireplace one night, and on a rainy night we watched a movie on the 55 inch television. This sounds made up, but I had the best night of sleep I’ve had in a long time! If we ever have the opportunity to go back to that area, we will be looking to see if this is available. If you’re thinking about renting here, don’t hesitate, do it!"

Group trip","This cabin is a destination of its own! It is filled with authentic touches but still has all the functionality that we look for today. The living room and dining room are so spacious. The kitchen is quite large and functional but still very cozy. The bedrooms are all on one end, so people can easily be on different schedules. I love the three different patios and the private, quiet, natural setting around the cabin. Meagan and Wade are great communicators and helped make our visit special. This was a stay that we will never forget!"

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay here! The atmosphere is amazing because you feel like you’re escaping into a wood cabin that is not in the middle of Winston-Salem. The cabin has an elegance and a coziness that just makes it a delightful place to be.
Meagan and Wade have mastered details like really good firewood, snuggly blankets, good coffee, and even good hand soap’s. Because we were there during some of the colder days of winter, it was so wonderful to have an ample supply of firewood. We kept a fire going the whole time, which just added to the warmth and coziness of the great room.
The large spaces had great furniture for gathering with lots of people, but there were also smaller spaces to have time with smaller groups or be alone. The decorations and interesting pieces of furniture added to the charm.
The owners were caring and thoughtful as they asked about and responded to our needs.
We will definitely stay here again next chance we get!"

The cabin has very comfortable furnishings, beds and linens, even has AC for the warm days. The kitchen had all the basic spices and condiments we needed... even coffee, cream and eggs, yogurt and granola !! We enjoyed the property with a family bon fire one evening and a BBQ meal at the amazing harvest dining table that seats 10.

Our hosts provided all of the amenities we needed and were easy to contact. The house was clean and beds were cozy. The rain heads in the showers were great. We were even given fruits & veggies from their garden. If you have a large group and don’t mind a few split level steps and rather dim lighting, this is the place to stay. Great porch in the back and fireplace in the living room!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a unique space. There are three true bedrooms, and four full bathrooms, all stocked well. The house layout made it feel private, even with a number of people staying. The main living room smelled of the fireplace, which was not a bad smell. The furnishings are antique, and could cause a triggering of allergies amongst those sensitive. The place was very clean however. I didn’t see a single bug, even though the house is very old. I loved the stay, but my wife would have preferred something more modern. Everything worked. The place is a little difficult to find at night, but ultimately is well located near wake forest university. There is a Starbucks about a mile away. Numerous restaurants around the nearby neighborhood. Overall, if you needed to have three full bedrooms, and four bathrooms, and needed to stay near Wake Forest, this is a good choice. If I had to do it over again, I would stay in this particular hosts modern home, which seems like it would also be nearby. Alas, it was rented when I was looking. The hosts also owned a restaurant locally and I was Sadly not able to try that. Perhaps next time…"

We appreciated the thoughtful touches, including a complimentary bottle of wine and numerous condiments in the refrigerator.
Meagan was VERY quick to respond to our questions and inquiries. She lives just up the driveway, so is very accessible if needed.
We had a great time, even though we didn't spend as much time in the home as we had hoped. Simply too much to see and do in Winston-Salem! We hope to return soon!"

We had everything to be cozy, and feel that we were by ourselves somewhere far and remote but yet you leave this precious location and in 10 minutes you find an amazing, hospitable city of Winston Salem full of restaurants, cafes, and a great baseball park . The kitchen was fully equipped . We made wonderful dinners. Meagan brought us tomatoes and eggs from her garden and chicken coop. What a treat ! And a great bottle of wine .

Sitting outside on one of several porches is simply a delight. The private fire pit was fun for an evening outside. The long dining table was awesome for a gathering of 10-12 for a special dinner during our visit. Beds were very comfortable, crisp clean sheets on all beds and duvets made for a good night's sleep. The decor of the house is such fun, and there are, in addition to the outdoor spaces, a couple of comfy living spaces to gather in, all beautifully decorated in a rustic chic way. Thoughtful supplies also found throughout the home...soaps, extra towels, etc.. Meagan and Wade were available to answer questions but unobtrusive. Just a fabulous stay...top notch all around!"

Stayed about a week","We spent 10 days in this lovely house in the woods with our daughter and son-in-law and their two young children. It was perfect in every way. Many other family members joined us there for holiday gatherings.

Meagan and Wade are great hosts. They were extremely welcoming, helpful, and responsive, and not at all intrusive. They seemed to take the utmost care with details that would help us feel comfortable.

We spent a lot of time on family meals and really appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and the large dining table that easily accommodated 10 of us with room to spare.

It's a house of generous spaces and interesting things on the walls. The inside and the outside, the many books, the imaginative use of lighting, and the modern conveniences, were enjoyed enormously by our whole family, children and adults alike.

Even though the house is in the woods, with a quiet residential neighborhood surrounding, the city with all of its shopping and cultural centers is easy to access from there.

I wholeheartedly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","When my girlfriend and I arrived at the Majestic Old Hunter's Lodge in the afternoon of December 2nd, we were greeted by Meagan, her daughter, and their unbelievably cute dog Taco. When we turned down the driveway and saw the house for the first time, it was way more beautiful than we imagined. Our reactions were, ""OH MY GOD!! THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING!"". Meagan then proceeded to show us around the house and property and we could not have been happier or more excited for the weekend we were about to spend with the rest of our guests.
We had ten guests total, and brought air mattresses for those who did not have a bedroom. We set them up in the living room and found that there was ample space for everyone. The fire places provided plenty of warmth while also contributing to the ""remote cabin"", ""winter feel"" to the whole experience.
On Friday night, my girlfriend and I prepared dinner for everyone and also cooked breakfast Saturday morning. The Lowes grocery store was only about a mile away from the house, which was etremely convenient. The Lowes also had a section in the store where they sold craft beer, which we thought was really cool, we bought two growlers as souvenirs. The kitchen met all of our needs as far as being provided with pots, pans, cooking oils and spices, along with plenty of space for cooking and just hanging out in general. The twelve seat dining room table was a great space for everyone to sit and eat while also enjoying each others company.
After breakfast on Saturday we all started to get ready for the wedding we were all in town for, and with the three bathrooms and large walk-in closets, we had no issues at all. When getting home after the wedding we were able to take an Uber downtown, which was only fifteen minutes away. The Uber drivers sometimes had trouble finding us, but it was no big deal.
Check out was at noon on Sunday as opposed to a normal check out time of eleven, which was great to have that extra hour to pack everything up and get everyone ready for the drive home.
All in all, everyone had an amazing time and we could not have asked for a better location to spend the weekend for our best friend's wedding. When we come back to Winston-Salem for football games, or to visit friends and family, we will absolutely be looking to stay here at the Majestic Old Hunter's Lodge again.
Thank you SO much Meagan - Kristen and I look forward to seeing you again sometime soon!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Dimeji and Bimpe’s home was nothing short of exceptional. The property was spacious and inviting offering ample room for my family and me. The bedrooms were cozy and comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped. The living area was a perfect place to watch movies, and the game room was a hit! Dimeji, Bimpe and Greg are great hosts who were incredibly accommodating and responsive throughout our stay. We highly recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation."

These made the stay more enjoyable and were a hit with my daughter's family (grandchildren!) whom we were visiting. Dimeji and Bimpe communicated regularly and were prompt with answers to any questions or needs. I would highly recommend this property to all, and we plan on staying here again on return visits."

They have spared no detail from the decor, the appliances, the snacks, tea, and coffee, to the mattresses, towels, and family games. I wish every AirBNB were designed by Dimeji and Bimpe. We will definitely stay there again!"

Group trip","This home was absolutely beautiful! There are so many lovely amenities and so much space that just made our stay so so much better! We ended up spending more time there than going out just because it was so cozy and fun. In such a perfect location for such a great price, we couldn’t be more grateful! The hosts are also just so lovely! Couldn’t recommend this stay more if I’m being honest!! We plan on coming back with the kids!!"

Plenty of space for our big family, and still room enough for company to visit. If the weather had been a little warmer and less windy, we would have definitely enjoyed the fire pit. Spacious and super clean. We highly recommend this home. We were impressed with Dimeji’s artwork, and truly felt we belonged. Thanks, Dimeji & Bimpe, and co-host Greg!"

Everything was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, anything you might need in the kitchen, and the showers had great water pressure! We loved sitting on the covered back patio listening to a thunderstorm. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

Stayed one night","My son and I decided to take a sort of last minute trip to Wake Forest to meet a good friend of his. I wanted the boys to have their own space, so getting an Airbnb made much more sense than 2 hotel rooms. We were in the actual house for less than 15 hours, but it was perfect. It was clean and uncluttered. Thao had provided all of the information we needed to get in to the house on day of check-in, and once inside, there was a list of restaurant and things to do provided (along with some snacks). We didn't eat any meals in the house, so can't speak to any of the cooking amenities, but the kitchen seemed to have everything one would need. Honestly, I think I was the only one who showered, but, shower was great. Great stay for us. Thank you, Thao!!"

Stayed a few nights","The bottom bed sheet had a large stain. We washed the sheets in the in-unit washer/dryer before sleeping. The mattress didn't even have any kind of cover/protector on it, and the mattress itself had a stain on it. When replacing the bottom sheet on the bed, the sheet ripped. I believe the sheets were probably older and not in great shape. I was requested to pay $60.00 for the sheet set, which I did."

Stayed a few nights","Laura’s place was convenient, cozy, cute, and well worth the reasonable price! This was a business trip and I wanted a home-like experience for the week. This was perfect for me with a comfy king bed. The kitchen was remodeled nicely and had a new sink and fridge. Coffee makers (2 options) with plenty of coffee pods. The owner was gracious to provide an air purifier when I asked, due to a faint smell of smoke, most likely from an irresponsible guest. The area was mixed with well kept older homes and apartments further down the road. I visited the YMCA only a block away. Note there are two sets of stairs, and two doors to unlock. Loved the easy and available off-street parking. I would choose this special home again in the future."

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Winston Salem at the Purple House and will stay there again without hesitation."
