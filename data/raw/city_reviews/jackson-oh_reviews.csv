Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect! I was working for a job for a week down here in Jackson, Ohio. It was a very relaxing and clean/peaceful apartment. Very spacey for a 1 bedroom/ 1 bathroom as well. Amenities were all there. Plus it was above a coffee shop which you can walk down the stairs and around the corner to get to! Would recommend for anyone staying in Jackson for a couple days to weeks for."

Stayed a few nights","It was very pretty and posh looking, right out of a magazine. Everything was very clean and the city sounds and lights outside of the window added to the uptown feel of the place. There was some noise from the restaurant below but not terrible just occasional hustle and bustle of a coffee shop below. We weren’t expecting the stairs leading up to the door way but to be fair I didn’t read the description throughly so perhaps I missed it. It is a very beautiful place though and offers a posh city atmosphere. It was a fun get-away for me and my husband, who normally are surrounded by the woods."

Stayed a few nights","Every aspect of my experience, from the booking process to the checkout, exceeded my expectations. The communication with the host was exceptional. They were prompt, friendly, and accommodating, making sure that all my questions and concerns were addressed before and during my stay. Their dedication to providing outstanding hospitality was evident throughout my entire experience. The property itself was an absolute delight. It was immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, and equipped with all the amenities one could possibly need. The attention to detail was remarkable, with thoughtful touches like complimentary toiletries, coffee, and bottled water. It truly felt like a home away from home! The location of the Airbnb was also fantastic. It is situated in a charming downtown and located above a delightful coffee shop. We had an amazing breakfast and coffee within a few feet of the property (The Spot on Main). You could walk to restaurants, stores, and a local ice cream shop!"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent spot...we stayed at this central location as we explored frozen Hocking Hills State Park, Athens/University of Ohio, and Serpent Mound (largest animal effigy in North America!).
Jenny gave us great food recommendations (Pi Express) and coffee at The Spot below was outstanding. The apt was very cozy and made for a great movie hangout!with plenty of space after hiking all day. We appreciated the natural light in the mornings paired with the beautiful church bells while we slept-in on a very comfortable bed.
Another small, but nice touch was being made aware that the cleaning fee actually covered things like dishes and stripping the bed, which made for a real quick check out. I know that doesn’t sound like a big deal, but having stayed at many Air BnBs with pricey cleaning fees that don’t do this it was very much appreciated and added to the luxury of the space."

Stayed a few nights","I travel a lot and stay often at Airbnbs. I must say without hesitation that this apartment was the cleanest, most modern yet home feel place we have stayed. I couldn't have asked for anything to make the experience better. The place was perfect. We enjoyed the small cafe directly below the apartment. It was the perfect touch to our perfect stay."

Stayed a few nights","It is worth the stay just to see the inside of this treasure. The late 1800's home has just the right amount of updates. I grew up in Jackson Ohio and have stayed elsewhere on my visits, but never again. I'm more likely to schedule this visit when this great home is available. Cindy was great at communicating with me and she leaves little notes here and there where she thinks a little extra information might be helpful. The decor was fun and interesting I think I took more pictures at this home than any other we have experienced. My wife only went out for part of a day. She was totally relaxed and loved every room. We will be going back soon."

Stayed a few nights","The house is amazing. Lots of room, large kitchen and fridge. I had the whole house to myself, but I never entered most of the rooms. Upstairs and downstairs are zoned separately for heat. The heat came up very fast and kept it pretty consistent overnight. The house itself is very nice, very open with high ceilings. One of the few places where I have gotten the tv to work; using my Netflix info. The beds in the main 2 rooms are very large. The one I slept in was very comfortable. Large bathroom with over a dozen towels. Since the house is so big I am guessing large groups use it and they would be very comfortable.
The house is just off the main road as you go into town so it's convenient to local restaurants. The classic country ""Main Street"" is just down the road. There was some traffic noise at night, but that is because the area is so quiet otherwise.
Parking is right next to the side door that is used. The door has a keypad that lights up, and goes right into an outer room, a ""mud room""(?) that is well list, where there is a small bathroom, and a laundry area.
I had great communication with the Hosts. They have notes around the house explaining how things work, and restaurant suggestions.
If I return next year to do the race I was in, I will definitely stay there again."

The value was unbelievable, first off.
We pulled up and awed at the fall/Halloween decorations straight off of a magazine cover. This is my favorite season!
When I walked in the door is when it hit me. My jaw literally hit the floor. It was straight out of an episode of HGTV’s Houses With History. I really appreciated the preservation of the house’s historic value. Paired with so many modern touches. Every corner, of every room, has a personal touch to it. It was so cozy! The beds were wonderful, and both bathrooms (along with the rest of the house) spotless.
I’d give it 100 ⭐️’s if I could. Can’t wait to come back and spend time there vs. just passing through!"

It was delicious!! Kids loved playing with dogs and feeding the cows bread. Pool was open and we enjoyed it. Our rooms were very clean and specious with large bathroom attached. We would stay again if we are in the area. They went above and beyond to make us comfortable. Thank you Mary & Greg!

Hopefully next time we will get to enjoy some of that delicious breakfast Mary was cooking when we headed out!
Excellent, helpful, gracious, generous hosts and we’re deeply grateful."

They really appreciated the very large breakfast layout (a surprise for them!) and walking around the property, feeding the cows. My 15 year old is not usually very talkative on these things...but he went on and on about how much he enjoyed staying here.
I was nervous sending my son on this trip...thank you so much for the awesome hospitality!"

Stayed one night","If you’re looking for a peaceful retreat in the country then look no further! The house is beautiful and clean and Mary makes an amazing breakfast! We had the master bedroom on the first floor and the bed was so unbelievably comfortable and the attached bathroom was huge! There’s a large back deck with a pool that looks out over their property (over 100 acres!). They do have animals (cows and pigs in the pastures and dogs that roam). The dogs are kept outside while there are guests and you’d never be able to tell from the inside. However, if you’re a dog lover like me, then the pups can come inside and they are adorable! We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again! If you’re not used to winding backroads I suggest arriving while it’s still daylight and taking Mary’s suggestion on the alternate route, however GPS does lead you right to their front door."

The house was beautiful and clean on a pretty lot out in the country. We had a great nights sleep in a comfortable bed and woke up to coffee, waffles and some of the best bacon I’ve ever had.

The apartment was wonderful! It was easy for me to settle in and get comfortable, and although not a very big place, it had a nice sense of spaciousness about it. Jenny thought of everything! I had no wants or needs.
I enjoyed the quietness of the countryside, and felt safe about staying there.
My experience there made my days of work go well.

Stayed one night","Perfect stay in the country. On a clear night, the stars are plenty. Pictures shown are accurate. Well appointed, extremely clean, and comfortable sleeping accommodations. Host is very responsive and yields plenty attention to detail to the unit, including welcome snacks. Kitchen, is fully stocked. Though the rental is connected to the host residence above the garage, we had complete privacy.
15 mins to Jackson or Waverly and 10 mins to Dogwood Pass Wild West Town attraction, which was the reason for our visit. Will definitely stay again when traveling the area."

The town of Jackson is about a 15 minute drive away, so grabbing a bite to eat shouldn't be an afterthought. With that being said, there is a full kitchen to be utilized. Which you are better off taking advantage of anyway, opposed to the many fast food chains that you are left to choose from otherwise. If you are looking for a place to stay that feels cozy and has any amenities you may need, your search stops here."

The one parking spot available in the rear was an obstacle my freind and I found a little troublesome. (It's a 2-person max Airbnb, but we had to drive in two seperate vehicles to meet up for the event located in the area.)
But all-in-all the rooms were clean! A drastic and refreshing atmosphere as opposed to the gentrifying alleyway lingering right outside the main door. And, once found and adjusted to our new environment, we found it welcoming. No bedbugs or worrisome leaks. Jason was very nice and receptive. Would come back and use again."

Stayed with a pet","Overall our stay worked out great as it's hard to find a place to stay overnight with three dogs. The trailer was as described including the horses 🐎 outside that were very friendly. The air-conditioning was fabulous 😍 with the 90° + weather. Furthermore, the furniture was extremely comfortable, appliances were in good working condition, surroundings were quiet.
The only issue we had was confusion on the location we were staying d/t being sent wrong directions from Beth. It was immediately resolved with a phone call around 1:00 am. Cudos to Beth for answering the phone immediately, to straighten things out and getting us to the correct rental. It was partially our fault for arriving so late. My apologies to the person and dog I woke up in the middle of the night."

Stayed with kids","We needed a place to split our trip from Tennessee to Michigan to let our 2 year old and 7 month old run around and rest- and this was PERFECT. The carpet in the living room was super soft so our baby enjoyed crawling around and the horses with the large yard was a hit with our 2 year old. There was a Walmart about 11 minutes away for food and necessities. It is a mobile home or trailer (whatever one calls this type of structure) so it’s not “perfect” but we have paid way higher prices to stay at hotels in HORRIBLE condition so we did not mind at all. Couches were comfortable, sunset was gorgeous, price was right, and the store literally next door was outstanding. We will absolutely stay here again if we’re passing through!"

Stayed a few nights","I would encourage guests to give Beth’s place top consideration if you will be in the area. We had a nice stay, in a very safe area with plenty of nice views and even with the house very close next door, we never felt like our privacy was in question. Beth’s place is located in a easy access area from the main road. We had the pleasure of seeing the horses in the back yard, were able to walk over to the arena across the road to watch some of a horse show, and we saw quite a few horse and buggy rides going by the home.
Just an FYI, there is no internet here ( I didn’t read in the listing that there wasn’t any) but the cell service was great. The tv wasn’t the greatest. The signal was lost more than it was found. You will need to bring paper products and anything you might want for the kitchen. No basic supplies were there such as salt and pepper or cooking oil. But overall it was a nice stay, in a really nice, safe area and I recommend this place to others."

Additionally one of the bathrooms has a floor that’s bowed way up and collapsing on one side. This place is not safe and should not be available as an Air B&B"

Stayed with kids","Overall we had a good stay. But wanted to give a heads up that there are also dirt bike events in the arena that is in close proximity. I would not describe our night as quiet. ;) Thankfully, our five year old slept through it. The space was clean, but not meticulously clean depending on how picky you may be. The trailer was set up well and met our space needs very well for my husband, son, mother-in-law and I. Thanks, Beth!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is a gorgeous little cabin tucked into a very high-end neighborhood. It’s attached to the main house by a shared patio. Hot tub and pool are on that patio. Super cute and perfectly comfortable. And pet-friendly so we were able to have our fur baby with us. Tons of windows and natural light. The down side of that is there are no curtains on the living room windows. It’s a very quiet & secure area so it’s not a problem, but just be aware if privacy or darkness is needed. Holly was a wonderful host! Super quick response anytime I needed her. Even on arrival when we couldn’t find the driveway in the dark! I had read the other reviews that said it was kind of hard to see the driveway so I knew to be on the lookout - but I still missed it! It really is tucked away right off the little turn around. Holly responded to my text super quick & reassured us we just needed to keep going:) Great experience & would definitely recommend."

It was a cute cozy cottage with very nice personal touches like snacks, water, teas, coffee, hot chocolate, spices for cooking and the best thing a dozen farm fresh eggs. We enjoyed walking around the farm and watching the pony and goats right outside the door. The night sky was gorgeous and so peaceful. We loved that there was a list of resturaunts and attractions surrounding the area and we found lots of thing to keep us busy. We would definitely love to visit again and would say this is one of the best airbnbs we have stayed at. Thank you for being a wonderful host."

The cottage was clean and stocked with plenty of towels, linens, and plenty of coffee and snacks. There's soup and noodles if you get in late and need a bedtime snack. This is also a perfect spot if you are a couple and just want to get away. The TV is very nice, and the internet is speedy. The host is awesome and will respond to questions in a matter of minutes.

Stayed one night","Jen was such a hospitable host. Friendly and very responsive which I appreciated since I was getting in well after dark and I never know how accurate googlmaps will be outside of larger cities. Just what I needed to lay my head for the night and continue on my way. Her place was easy to find and just as described. A welcome basket with some snacks was perfect since I was coming in late night.
The place had any of the amenities I might need and it Had every kitchen appliance I could need (the hot plate was perfect and I did not miss the lack of stovetop. The farm fresh eggs from her chickens that she left in the fridge were wonderful to have for breakfast in the morning.
I’m short so this was a non issue for me but to note the ceiling in the bathroom is low so if I was a 6ft tall individual I’d be very close to the ceiling.
The mattress was on the softer side so if that’s your jam this is your spot.
Overall a cute cozy place, perfect for the solo traveler or small couple."
