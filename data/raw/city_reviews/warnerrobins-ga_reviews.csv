Stayed with a pet","Great house and location. Plenty of room for our girls weekend.
Beds were comfortable. The downstairs shower had a low threshold which was great.
Plenty of parking and the dogs enjoyed their romps in the woods.
We will definitely be back!"

Stayed with a pet","We booked the cottage for about a week and I would definitely recommend it! The three bedrooms were perfect for my husband, our two big dogs, my mother-in-law and aunt to all have our own space. The living spaces were really cute, cozy and perfect for unwinding at the end of the day. The kitchen and bathrooms were very clean and had all the essentials without being cluttered which made it easy to find anything we needed. Kelley was responsive and friendly, and when I asked to extend the reservation she was accommodating. There were more local restaurants in the area than I had anticipated which was a nice surprise! We especially liked Morning by Morning coffee shop and Tap and Pour brewery."

Neighborhood is generally quiet and I felt safe even without the amazing added feature of having security cameras outside the home. The home was pretty clean & decently stocked with the listed amenities. Word to the wise though, the shower is amazing & gets as hot as you like, but it doesn’t last long, so be quick! This place was a great accommodation and I would 10/10 recommend!!"

The response time was excellent. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends. The place is so clean and cared for. It makes you feel like you are at home. The thoughfulness of having shampoo and towels and blankets just is a blessing. This is my third experience with Airbnb. I am used to going to a hotel, but I have fallen in love with this experience. In life, you have to take time out for yourself to regroup. This place is definitely a place that will help you regroup."

Elaine’s place was sparkling clean and she was a gracious and helpful host. She was very helpful, very quick to communicate and address our queries and followed up to ensure we were happy. The decor was modern and new. And the floor treatments practical. Thoughtful touches like some complimentary snacks and coffee pods. The bed although new was not quite supportive enough for us. The kitchen could do with a couple more large saucepans, salad bowl and Pyrex jug/bowl for microwave. Use of the vacuum requires hearing protection."

Marquita's communication was great, and check-in was simple and straightforward. The inside was nicely decorated and seemed to have been remodeled (bathrooms, bedrooms, living room). It was well stocked with towels and extra blankets/throws, and kitchen needs. The kitchen was also quite large, which was a pleasant surprise. Everything (the plumbing, air conditioning, cable TV, wifi, water pressure, etc.) all worked well. Just no issues to speak of."

Stayed with kids","This place felt like home the instant we walked in the door. We are from Cape Cod, and the beachy and rustic themes felt so comforting. The owners thought of absolutely every detail, from puzzles and games for our daughter, to a lovely coffee center, interesting coffee table books, Netflix and TVs in the bedrooms, and bottled water in the fridge. The high ceilings and cottage-style doors were beautiful.
Additionally, their thoughtfulness was over the top. We had come to town to take placement of a newborn in a private adoption, but sadly the match failed at the last minute when the birth mother decided to parent. Not only did they allow us to change our reservation, but they also checked in to see how we were holding up emotionally and told us they were praying for us. So kind and personal.
We would 100% stay here again in the future if we're in the area. Not only that, but I've made notes of home decor ideas I want to use in our own home!"

They go above and beyond to ensure your arrival has all necessities for a comfortable stay. They provide enough water and coffee for the first day so in case you have late check in. They provide lots of towels and extras that make it enjoyable. The house is user friendly. We had to contact host with a special request and they went above and beyond for our situation. We highly recommended this property to everyone. You will not be disappointed. The lawn is very manicured and well maintained. We would give them 10 stars if we could.

Stayed about a week","The house represented a country modern feel with espresso warm tones and lovely color accents such as yellow and turquoise. The coffee bar was well stocked with different types of sugar, tea, coco, and other snacks. The kitchen was very large and included dishes, pots, pans, cups, plates, etc. The family room had an amazing book shelf which included historical books arranged in a beautiful pattern. The sofa included blue and gray pillows and a swivel chair. Each flat screen television was already set up with the wifi and the codes were located on the coffee station table. The directions included how to care for the house and how to shut down before your departure. The master suite was elegant which included a large bedroom, spacious bathroom, and walk in closet. The other two rooms had country charm with peach pillows and a lovely shared bathroom. They left games in the hall closet and a fresh warm scent throughout the home. There is a large backyard with a grill. We enjoyed our stay!"

The kitchen had many seasonings and everything you'd need to make a tasty meal. The coffee maker and complimentary coffee and hot chocolate were a nice touch. We were able to trick-or-treat in the neighborhood as many neighbors were out giving candy out. Interactions with Ed &Paula were personable & pleasant. Highly recommend this home!!!"

Stayed with kids","I always try to stay at an air b and b that’s a super host but I came across Hannah and Lilly’s new listing and wanted to give it a try. They outdid any super host we have stayed in. The place was adorable with all the decorations , the most comfortable beds, very clean, the kitchen very stocked with just about everything you need to cook any meal, and the area centrally located to everything. Very safe place to stay. We loved every bit of our stay. Our kids were so impressed with everything and wanted the host to know how much they loved it. Thank you Hannah and Lilly for opening your home to us. I know they will be super hosts soon. We came to see my daughter’s boyfriend who is stationed at Robins so being very close to base was another plus. If you are ever in the area give them a try as you won’t be disappointed. We will definitely stay again if ever in the area. Very responsive hosts as well."

Fully furnished with everything & more for a nights stay including an electric hot water pot, tea, coffee, sugar, and creamer as well as a tray of ice cubes in the freezer and bottled water in the fridge.. I was able to make my coffee when I arrived and let it chill to refrigerate for iced coffee in the morning.. Loved the hot shower and the heater to turn on in the morning to get the chill off.. top it off the landscape was so beautiful around the cabin. I transport a car from Florida every spring as well as return it six months later for friends who winter there and this charm will be my new stop. THANKS AMOS"

Stayed with a pet","Tiny house was easy to maneuver in. Plenty of lighting. Easy to step up onto deck in front of house. Dead end cul de sac. Extremely good, private parking. I thought from photos would be in country but it was in a neighborhood
i arrived after dark so really never saw the extent of the property, so walked my dog instead. Very quiet. Everything was very neat.
Heating unit was noisy, but I was so tired I went to sleep. Bed was good. Could use another ""crunchable"" pillow.
I left very early and never got to comment to host.
It would have been helpful to have salt and pepper. I brought leftovers and only one pot & paper dishes, no fry pan. Shower was fine.
I think couple extra rugs would be good as I was tracking in leaves as it was pouring rain the whole trip, also an extra towel to catch water on floor when one showers. Hated to use a white towel on the floor. And new dish scrubbers and dish towel.
It is pleasant and good w/a pet."

Stayed one night","Amos has a clean place that beats a highway motel in price. He offers a great value for any traveler. Plenty to eat in the surrounding town. Sure, it's bare bones, but it has what you need to set you up for the overnight. A reviewer mentioned how low the ceilings were, but they weren't that low to me at 5'10"" there was easily another 9 inches above and this only in the front and above the bed, the rest was high up above. Can park right near the front door -easy in and out. Definitely a good value."

The Home is completely private, and it's adorable. it has a very nice interior and is comfortable and clean. the house had great wifi, everything worked, had a decent TV, and my favorite part is the water gets hot! I thought this could've been a issue with a tiny house but I was wrong! not to mention the garden that surrounds the house is wonderful. the house is closer to the main house than it seems in photos, but Im okay with that. You also do get your own space for a car right next to the house. Lastly, the host were very friendly and understanding of any situation you may have going on. they will not make you feel rushed or forced to do anything. Definitely will come back if I need somewhere to stay!"

Stayed one night","I selected this listing for my first Airbnb experience because the price was fantastic & the home was private! I felt that I got a lot for the small $ that I paid. To begin with, it was nice having a dedicated parking spot next to the house.
When I drove up, I was immediately drawn to the lovely flowers surrounding the tiny home. I need to come back when it is not in the height of a Georgia summer heat wave & enjoy his beautiful flowers.
Speaking of heat-wave, Amos had the space nice & cool when I arrived. The tiny home has an air conditioner & a tower fan. The tower fan was a nice addition since I like to sleep with a fan.
The listing was exactly as described & pictured in the listing. I especially appreciated the dedicated workspace. Everything was clean & thoughtfully arranged to maximize space.
The only thing I would change is the addition of a hair dryer. I saw from the listing that I would have to bring mine from home. Otherwise, everything was delightful.
Thanks, Amos!"

Stayed one night","Overall for the cheap price, it wasn’t a bad stay. However if you are over 6 feet tall, this may not be the best house for you. 2/3rds of the ceilings in this house are very low. I almost hit my head and wasn’t able to walk under the light on the ceiling without hitting my head. I could barely sit on the toilet because my knees touched the wall in front of me.
The location felt a little sketchy. The house next door had its windows boarded up and quite a bit of traffic in and out throughout the evening. I also felt like in the pictures, the house is back a little from the main house, but it is really right behind it.
The host came out to his garage with his dog while I was sitting on the deck attached to our place, just enjoying the weather. I tried speaking with him, said hi, how was his evening, and got no response. I repeated myself, I asked if he needed me to go in so he could let his dog use the restroom, no response. He just stood there and watched me until I went inside."

Stayed a few nights","Oh, I really super enjoyed my stay at this Airbnb. It was the cutest little house that had been thoughtfully decorated. there was a combination lock on the little house, therefore, I felt very safe. They have a fence with a gate so when you park you feel like your car is very safe in there. Do you even have your own parking spot? That does not interfere with the owners parking. The neighborhood was nice and the house is on a cul-de-sac. It was like they thought of everything. It was painted pretty inside and had an air conditioner and a hot shower and the bathroom smelled really fantastic. They had nice white, crisp, clean towels, and a television also. They had coffee and creamer and sugar and a little kitchen table. The pictures really don’t do it justice because it was plenty big enough and not tiny or small at all. There were flowers in the yard and it was a very peaceful place. The host was very responsive and friendly. This is probably my favorite Airbnb that I have stayed at."

Stayed with a pet","This is a tiny house in a residential neighborhood. It was perfect for my 2 dogs and me. The yard is fenced in which gave the dogs some space. For a tiny house the inside has just the right amount of furnishings leaving open space as to not feel cramped. Amos and his wife were nearby, extremely friendly and helpful but not intrusive. I could not have found a better place to stay for our special event."

The yard and garden were lovely and the parking was in a gated yard. My only challenge with the place was that the bed felt really hard to me, so i didn't sleep well. I know I like a softer bed than most people, so you might find it fine for you."

Stayed with a pet","As a woman traveling alone with a big dog, I can't say enough in praise of Amos's tidy tiny house, Mrs. Amos's friendly welcome, and the restful stay I had with them. The house is small, clean, and comfortable. I parked inside the gate and next to the house which has a large deck in front. My dog played with the hosts' wonderful dog in their lovely, fenced, flower-filled back yard. Amos and his wife are good at putting travelers at ease but also giving guests lots of space -- they are clearly experienced Inn keepers. I felt 100% safe! I'll book here again and again when I make the drive from Miami to Iowa City."

Her place was so quaint and beautifully decorated. Staying at an AirBNB on a farm is the best way to go when you have 3 kids. Great memories were made just letting the boys run around like kids should do the entire time - playing with the ducks, watching the chickens, and petting the adorably sweet baby goats that were only a week old! Not only that, but the young gentleman who tends to the animals brought us a fresh batch of eggs the very first day, and I can honestly say they were the best eggs I've ever eaten in my life! Everyone was so sweet to work with and Miranda was so communicative! Great experience all around!"

The cool part was we got to play ping-pong for hours while the baby was walking around the room and she was just short enough to go under the table without hitting her head. It was awesome. They do have wonderful hibachi down the street so we did that and then we went back the next day and got sushi from the same spot, and then, of course, cookout has the best cheer wine floats in America. The house was big wonderful and clean, and I really like the bed in the master bedroom."

Stayed a few nights","We were here for the weekend in Warner Robins. For a three bedroom with a game room, and lots of space , the price was not bad.
Where I get upset is in the cleaning and general sanitation.
I’m not really sure what happened, but there was just too much dust on surfaces, there were smashed flies on the inside of the window of the living room, and all the window edges were layered with dust. The dining room chairs had stains on them from liquids spillage, the master bedroom pillows has brown liquid circles under the pillow case from the absence of a protector.
In general the place just needed to be cleaned and sanitized thoroughly before hosting anyone.
The front door was tricky to lock even thought they left a sign. We had locked it and verified, but then my sister in laws walks right in later at night and said it was open. The front door had no lights and the bulb was out and covered by a nest."

Stayed with kids","This was an okay stay. Upon arrival, access was fairly easy but there was an odd, musk smell. On the surface, the house is pretty accurate to the pictures. It seemed clean & organized. They did a good job of modernizing it with new furnishings, decorations, & floors. But when we started looking at some things, this home needs a serious deep cleaning. No one is perfect but there was dust in a lot of places (concern for allergies), vents seem like they haven’t been cleaned in years, there were some dingy pillowcases, stains on the shower curtain, ice maker was dirty, and also there were dead roaches under the dresser with some, I’m guessing, former tenants clothes. One of the queen beds is actually a full. Also, the washer was making a loud banging noise. All things, that made my friends and I believe that they are doing the bare minimum to clean. I really didn’t want to do a bad review but my friends & I didn’t feel comfortable. So we bought extra blankets from the store."

The house was very clean upon arrival. The rooms were super cute and the beds comfortable. We loved the game room, definitely an extra touch for an Airbnb! The kitchen is stocked with the basic supplies - and as she lets you know, there is coffee upon arrival but besides that and a few seasonings that is all the kitchen had. If you plan to cook bring oils and whatever other basics you think you’ll need that you might not think of (if you’re driving in at least). But we had a great stay, would absolutely return."

Stayed about a week",expect the unexpected expect if you're very comfortable in at home with lots of room beautiful natural lighting and comfortable furniture.. The home is exactly as advertised except the beds are very comfortable and the area very convenient to anything you could possibly want. have stayed with Cheryl's rentals before and will do so again. welcoming committee included a gray squirrel who loves to have a slice of apple in the morning outside in the carport.. check in was quick and easy and the home is easy to find .. a great place to stay if you want to stay in or go out.. Love the game room with the comfortable furniture and the good movies. visiting my grandson from the Air Force Base he enjoys a place to stay away from base that is more like a home than a dorm room.. The kitchen was great for quick breakfast or dinner around that lovely white table with a beautiful chandelier.. Will be back again next time we visit Warner Robins.. thank you so much Cheryl for sharing your home with us.

All one needs in a place out of town to stay. Nice bathroom/shower, and nice space for work-at-home. Fast internet. Ron & Paul"

We came in for the NBHA Youth World show and needed a place to stay last minute, luckily we found this one. right down the road from a Starbucks it was the perfect place. one bedroom one living room one bathroom and a work nook was perfect. Nice area, clean home and surrounding, very friendly."

Group trip","Stayed for 1 night. There was not enough towels and the ones that were available were extremely old and dingy and when removing sheets the beds were terribly stained red/brown. Check out was too much. We are expecting to basically clean the whole house (except stripping the bed, which we saw why. The stains under the sheets were disgusting.) Then, we had to pack and start dishwasher. Put laundry in the washing machine and start it. It is also required not only to collect your trash, but also take it out. This is entirely too much for Airbnb stay. What was the 75$ cleaning fee for?"

Host leaves a small basket of snacks. There is also a toaster, blender, and a keurig. Full size washer and dryer. Ceiling fans in living room and bedrooms was nice as well.

SO kind! then at check in we had a minor mess and the host immediately responded to my message and even offered to personally come clean up the Mess right away.
lastly then we had a unexpected health issue arise and left before the reservation was over and the host was so kind about the condition of the home when we left. we will definitely stay here next time we are in the area and will recommend to friends that are traveling!"

Check in was a breeze even though we arrived late at night. We found some dog hair in one bed the first night we stayed, but we arrived late at night and it was otherwise a very clean home. It was spotless on our second visit here, so I think it was just a fluke. Beds are very firm for my preference, but it was fine for a night. Showers had good water pressure and plenty of towels were provided. We appreciated the snacks and water bottles provided. There was also a keurig available. We would stay here again."

Tucked away near a quiet cul-de-sac and far enough away from the interstate (but not too far!), the house was quiet and very relaxing. A huge bonus was the empty garage, allowing us to keep dry amid the rain!
She's done her homework on how to have a GREAT AirBNB, and I can't recommend this house enough, whether you're passing through or need to stick around a few days! Great location, easy access to amenities, and also reasonably convenient to Macon and even Atlanta areas.
Thanks for being a great hostess, Jennifer!"

The house is a better value than a hotel. also Jennifer was the best host ever. The day before I asked if there was a blender in the house. I make smoothies every day. Jennifer bought and delivered one before I arrived. So nice of her to go above and beyond. it worked great. thanks again for everything.

If I had simply cancelled I would have received part of my money back but because I was waiting on the host I got no refund. Just a warning that there appears to be a service / bot managing this Airbnb and human responses are so slow they are useless."

Trash bin outside stunk really bad, the trash in kitchen was dirty, towels were dingy, pillows were flat, and couch was somewhat broken. Overall not bad because the house was in my sisters neighborhood but it did not feel like home. The attention to detail is lacking perhaps from their cleaning service. We would stay here again if we saw that the reviews prior to stay have improved in cleanliness."

Stayed about a week","Nice, easy place to get to. This is our 3rd stay, mostly a good experience. However, When we arrived to check in the garage code didnt work, immediately notified the owner, said he would have someone out and no one ever showed. Also had numerous problems with the lock on the front door which is a number keypad, worked a couple times and then stopped, so had to go around the back of the house, in the dark to go use the back door. It was dark and gated and we were there for 11 days, so was very inconvenient. Finally got a key to use for the front door, 1 day before we were to leave, found out owner doesnt live in town, not sure if thats why the issue wasent resolved."

House of clean and bug free (besides some gnats found in the trash, which I’m sure was from food getting under the bag) The outdoor patio could have seen a power washer but was enjoyable.

Nice kitchen and two large televisions with most of the streaming apps available for use. Everything is as shown, probably better. Neighborhood is nice and neighbors are friendly. (Just watch for dogs if you go for a walk away from the home as we saw several dogs not on leashes.) Adam is very responsive and will make sure you are taken care of during your trip."

Easy check in and communication with the owners, except when requesting last minute credit/partial refund…then no answer. We had reserved the property for 7 guests, but when only 4 guests used the property; no refund was issued. All in all not a bad experience, just make sure that you keep in mind that if someone from your group cancels, you probably won’t get a refund."

Stayed a few nights","This immaculately clean and well-appointed home was a great place to stay as we helped move a family member into a new house around the corner. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were nice (the main bathroom is roomy and great for a couple), and the garage and fenced backyard were pluses security and privacy. We used the washer/dryer to do some laundry, and the kitchen was stocked with Keurig coffee and all the dishes we could need. We didn't have much time to lounge, but the comfy recliner couches in the living room were great for sitting, and every seat had a good view of a large TV. The only (minor) issue we encountered was a strong fishy odor in the refrigerator, but we didn't cook while visiting so this wasn't so inconvenient. Thanks to Adam for prompt replies to all our messages and questions, and for providing a great home for our trip to Warner Robins, a great place to visit. We hope to be back soon!"

As we relocated to this area this place was the perfect stress free stay we needed as we await our new home and as I transition to my new work location.

Stayed with kids","I seriously could not have made a better choice for our trip to Warner Robins, especially when it came to fulfilling our specific needs for a family with children. The value of renting an entire house cannot be understated, it definitely checked all the boxes. Adam was a great host, very friendly and responsive. It's located in a nice quiet neighborhood with a private backyard. I actually wish I would have booked it for longer. The mattresses were legitimately comfortable, the additional bed hidden in the master closet was a nice touch, along with the additional linens, pillows, towels, and all the other basic household items that also came included (those things make a big difference imo). Not to mention the convenience of having a washer/dryer, and the Keurig was obviously a big hit! If I have to make any future trips down there I will definitely be reaching out to check availability."

The host communicated with me throughout my stay and was fast in answering my questions. Check-in and check-out was flawless. All the amenities that you would find in a hotel are provided plus much more. This property beats out a hotel stay any day. I am big on smells and on arrival there was a pleasant scent in the air. Nothing overbearing like chemical sprays you find in some hotels. The living room area was spacious as well as the three bedrooms. There is a TV available in the living room area as well as the master bedroom. My teenager had fun with ""Alexa"" during our stay. For coffee drinkers there is a Keurig and adequate enough kitchen space with all utensils provided for those who would like to cook. Instead of returning home with dirty laundry I was able to wash clothing before our departure which was a benefit for me. Overall the home is well kept and clean. Thanks to our Host for a pleasant experience."

There were plenty of coffee supplies and some snacks and shower supplies. We slept wonderfully and would 100% stay here again! It was very safe feeling and quiet. We couldn’t have been happier with our selection. I actually had chosen another place prior and then read some recent reviews and changed to Ut’s place and I’m so glad I did."

Stayed with a pet","This home was most comfy and clean and the furniture was like new; especially the super main bed. The neighborhood was a bit crowded with houses but this place was tucked into a nice cul-de-sac. Even though there was a really bad thunderstorm that hit through the night, we barely heard it. Got a great night sleep. The well stocked kitchen made for a very pleasant breakfast. Loved the Keurig coffee and the packs of goodies left by Ut for folks to enjoy. Our pup was so happy to run around the little fenced in back yard. Overall a most happy find for a very fair price. Way better than any hotel room."

We were a little worried if this place was in a safe neighborhood when booking, since we weren’t familiar with the area, but I can say it exceeded all expectations. This house is part of a nice little quaint neighborhood where we felt very safe and secure all night. I highly recommend this place!!"

Stayed one night","it's nice for a pet, as it has a very secure privacy fence
That being said, there were noticeable dog pee stains on the carpet. The linoleum in the kitchen was very scuffed.
The beds were OK but VERY bouncy and small. I still slept pretty well.
Good location, near gas and food and easy access to I-75. Cul de sac road keeps it quiet and safe.
Overall: not too pricy and good location make it worth at least checking out."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed in this villa overnight on our way to Florida because we were traveling with four well-behaved dogs for an agility competition and we wanted a backyard as well as it’s hard to find a hotel for multiple dogs.
The backyard has a 6 ft privacy fence and was perfect for the dogs to stretch their legs. The house was spotless and spacious enough for the humans and four large dogs. The host provided everything we needed as far as amenities and we really appreciated the snacks and coffee!!
I hate paying a large cleaning fee for one night so usually limit my airbnb reservations to longer stays, but in this case it was totally worth it. This will become a regular stop on our FL trips in the future.
It was in the town of Warner Robins so about 7 minutes off I-75, but totally worth it."

Stayed one night","The description of 3 beds is literally that. There are two bedrooms, one with a queen bed and one with two twin beds.
The TV was a challenge because the remote was not correct. I found another Universal remote in the master bedroom and we had to look up directions for how it could’ve be paired with the TV.
The home is not a standalone. It is a townhome (connected to others). That was a bit disconcerting.
The home was uber clean, had a nice snack bar, and coffee options."

The place is nicer than the picture, rooms are spacious, living room could’ve fit a king size mattress. I have no complaints other than we couldn’t get the remote to connect to the TV, but oh well not a big deal whatsoever. Ut communicated and read that we had an infant and sent us pictures of all the things we could use for him (baby seat for table, kids plates and utensils, packnplay). Very easy to check in and out too. Quiet neighborhood and from what locals told me the “good side of town”"

Stayed with a pet","If you plan to put an adult in those twin beds, DON'T! I got 4 hours of sleep! I have never even seen a bed like this in my life. I was so mad that anyone would put those ""beds"" in there! Where do you even get those things? They're so small that the Twin frame they are sitting on is much bigger than the mattress. It felt like a blow up mattress, but it wasn't. You'd sit on one end, and the rest of the mattress would tilt upward. When I was sleeping, if I dared to even shift or move, I'd wake up in fear that the mattress was going to tilt and that I'd slide off the bed. Having 20 rushes of adrenaline during the night is awful! I had to drive all day the next day and kept falling asleep. She could have just bought a $100 foam mattress! I don't understand why anyone would be so cruel as to cause a terrible night's sleep to travelers who have to DRIVE all day the next day. I hope this host did something amazing with that $100 that she saved. Hope it was worth my safety."
