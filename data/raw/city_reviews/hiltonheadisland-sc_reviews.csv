Stayed a few nights","The location of this unit couldn't be better!! The patio overlooks the ocean and beach. With a keyless entry, we were able to just head out to walk the beach without bringing a bag. The kitchen had plenty of dishes, cookware, appliances & three types of coffee makers. You'll need to bring the food of your choice, because there's only salt & pepper in the unit. Be sure to bring your own soap, shampoo, conditioner, they only provide small samples. This is an older community that is well maintained and this unit has recently been beautifully renovated. We stopped at the Publix grocery store before checking in for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Since this was Memorial Day weekend, all the restaurants had a long wait & traffic in/out was horrible. This unit was so comfortable, I would have preferred to stay in & prepare dinner in the condo also. The pools were crowded with lots of families with kids, so we preferred time on the beach. We just relaxed but there's plenty of activities"

We were very pleased with our time spent there.
Wonderful views, clean, cozy and comfortable.
The view from the balcony was amazing.
At night time we had an awesome view of the full moon over the ocean.

Stayed about a week","I enjoyed staying here for a 9 day solo vacation. The location of the unit is steps away from a walkway to the beach, and a short stroll away from a small pool. (There’s also a much larger pool on the property.) The closest entrance to the condo does have a short flight of stairs. Grocery stores/restaurants are nearby, and there’s a bar and restaurant on site.
The condo is comfortable, well-equipped, and generally quiet, though the sound of the wind can be audible at night. The view of the ocean from the balcony was a highlight of my stay! (Note: BYO pantry basics like oil, spices, tea, etc.) The mattress is on the softer side, but the blackout shades were great. Whenever I had questions, Chad communicated promptly and quickly resolved minor issues. He provides very thorough info/directions (ex. beach towels aren’t provided). Please take the time to read them before you come, so there are no surprises. I had such a wonderful trip that I’m already dreaming of my next getaway!"

Stayed a few nights",We had a great time on HHI. Chad’s place is exactly as pictured and was very clean and well-appointed. The resort has easy parking and quick beach access. The views from the balcony were beautiful and the cross-breeze in the corner unit was perfect. Chad is a very communicative host and left plenty of information about the property and the island. Thanks for a great stay!

Stayed with kids","Gorgeous, updated condo in an amazing location with incredible views and amenities. It was our first time to Hilton Head Island and there is so much to do close by. We did the Dolphin Discovery boat ride to watch dolphins up close in their natural habitat, rented E Bikes from Arrow Bikes who delivered them right to the condo, biked to shopping and resturants. Walked on the beach, drank Pina coladas by the pool and just enjoyed! Excellent trip, great hospitality from the host and an incredible spot to relax at the end of the day and watch the sunset from balcony."

Stayed a few nights","We had an absolutely wonderful stay at your beachfront condo last weekend. The condo itself was beautifully decorated, sparkling clean, and extremely welcoming. The living spaces were comfortable and well-appointed, and the view of the ocean from the patio was stunning.
The location right on the beach could not have been better. It was incredibly convenient to step outside and be right on the sand. The beach itself was clean and peaceful, perfect for long walks, playing games, or simply relaxing. The sound of the waves along with the ocean breezes setting the scene for a tranquil getaway.
We had a fantastic time during our stay. In the evenings we enjoyed preparing meals together in the well-equipped kitchen and dining while looking out at the sunset over the water.
I highly recommend this Airbnb rental to anyone looking for beach vacation. Great experience Chad!"

Stayed over a week","If you are looking for a prime spot to view beautiful sunrises and even catch sunsets from the same spot, then look no further. It’s your corner office away from the office.
Well appointed, including an actual properly sized main TV — I can’t tell you how often this is either overlooked or just plain neglected which is crazy knowing that large TVs now can be obtained for a rather small investment. You’ll appreciate this.
Lots of space in the kitchen and plenty of counter real estate for prepping meals if you decide to not take advantage of the plethora of restaurants. We made food in-house often, well my wife did, because she is an amazing chef.
A king-sized bed is key and they took care of not only having this, but making sure it was comfortable as well so it is easy to relaxe into restful nights. The shower is ample size and furnishings throughout are well done. We would recommend this spot to anyone as a worthy expenditure of your hard-earned money."

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful condo with a spectacular ocean view! Super clean, comfortable and a great location. It is an older community but it is well maintained, clean and quiet. The unit itself has been beautifully updated and felt brand new. We didn’t have time to use any of the community amenities but there seemed to be a lot of options available. We were in town for our daughters wedding in Bluffton along with several others which meant we visited some of the hotels in the area as well. Hands down, this condo has the best view, ease of beach access, and was the most comfortable. Chad was excellent, he sent check in details ahead of arrival, checked on us once we were settled, and checked in again as we were leaving. My husband is already talking about coming back for a real vacation and staying in this unit next year!"

Stayed a few nights","This has been a great experience. The condo was immaculate, and its oceanfront location was the best! We could continuously hear the surf, which made for a relaxing and peaceful stay. We did not want to leave!
We travel frequently and stay at AirBandB’s often, and this is one of the best stays. If you want to experience the ideal place on the beach, you should not hesitate to book this one. You can’t go wrong.
Chad, the host, was very responsive at all times. We had an issue with the refrigerator’s temperature control, and Chad arranged for two different repairmen to come promptly. As it turned out, the refrigerator is actually being replaced with a new one, within days of our stay.

The beach was very busy in a summer weekend but that’s to be expected. Be aware there is public access to the beach to the south so you may see more traffic than you expect down that way. All in all it’s a huge beach and there’s plenty of room. We body surfed the whole time 🤙🏼"

Stayed with kids","Chad went above and beyond with communicating and made sure we had everything we need to have a great time. Folly Field Beach might be the best we've visited. The seashells are lacking but the sand is so nice and packed, you don't end up taking it all back with you. We loved the seaside view and enjoyed a couple of nights watching lightning storms across the ocean. In the mornings, you can also see the dolphins from the balcony catching a sunrise swim.
The only note of improvement I have is the lack of water pressure in the shower but that's an easy fix.
The resort is dated but well maintained and has some wonderful amenities just a short walk or quick drive from where you are. If you're looking for a location on the quieter side of town, this is it!"

Stayed a few nights","This one bedroom condo was cute, cozy, and remodeled. It was small but perfect for two. The view from the living area and balcony was breathtaking. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and dolphins at breakfast each morning. The beach is nice and was not crowded in April.
The bed is very comfortable and has a thick memory foam topper. There was a nice selection of pillows, but there were only two pillows cases. Chad did offer to have some delivered, but we made do with what we had. The linens could be a little better quality.
The entry door opens right next to the bed which was odd, but the unit is at the end of the building so it's fairly quiet, and we felt safe.
Chad is an excellent communicator and was quick to respond to and resolve any issues we had. Prior to our stay he sent a lot of helpful information. The binder in the unit also has instructions for practically everything.
Favorites on HHI: The beach, biking in Sea Pines, Harbor Town, Coast, Cinnamon Bear, and Hudson's."

Condo was stylishly decorated, welcoming and truly felt like an oasis. Fully stocked kitchen and on-site laundry and gym to workout.
Host also graciously provided us with great recommendations. We enjoyed the Gullah tour and museum, visiting a host of Ocean front restaurants, HH light house, Audubon Nature tour and other activities.
I highly recommend staying at Chads space. Waking up to scenic panoramic ocean views is priceless. Thank you Chad, for helping to make our trip to HH a truly memorable experience. My husband and I will visit again."

It was so nice to pop down to the beach and be such a quick walk back to the condo. It was nice to have the restaurants on site to grab a drink or jump into Coconutzs sports bar to catch part of football Sunday. The staff at the bar was great and we loved the company in there.

I felt like we had the best location on the resort, beautiful views, access to the beach was so easy and the resources left in the room to navigate the resort and island were so helpful. Would definitely stay here again when vacationing in Hilton Head!"

The living area had everything we needed. The bedroom was very comfortable. All the amenities at the resort were great. We loved the pool area. And last but definitely not least, Chad was a fantastic host. He let us know about the golf courses and restaurants in the area. He was also available by text or phone call.

Stayed a few nights","If you like nice things, clean things, and places that are relaxing and offer up ocean views for days; you'll want to stay here. It's not large, but it's not so tiny that you can't enjoy your time there. I will say that both the bed and the sofa bed were comfortable, the sofa bed would have been tough for me to share with somebody else just because I like my own space. but it would work great for a couple of nights and be absolutely fine for a week with smaller kids. I loved having the option of a Keurig or a drip coffee maker. The shower pressure was awesome. The sun rises were amazing.
Checking in and checking out. were very detailed which was welcomed. Chad is an awesome communicator and made me feel as though he really cared about our experience. He didn't have to but it was appreciated that he did.
I'm sure that if I venture back to Hilton Head I will be checking on the availability of this condo first."

The place has upscale decor, newly remodeled and views that are worth every penny. Super Host amenities and superb comminication throughout. The resort is family friendly with playgounds and tons of activities. There was even a craft fair during our stay on the grounds. The guest book is full of excellent reccomendations.
Would definately rent from and stay again - a true gem in Hilton Head!

Chad is detail oriented and obviously takes pride in his work. The view from the balcony and the proximity to the boardwalk alone would make for a wonderful stay, but then having a host who makes his place warm and comfortable for his guests really raises it up a notch. We hope to re-visit sometime soon."

Stayed about a week","Chad was an excellent host. The condo is as described, with a beautiful deck providing the greatest beach views. Entire condo has been renovated and is super modern and cute. The unit is on the end with no foot traffic by it, so very quiet. The bed is very comfy and huge. Lots of room in closet for everything you packed. There are baskets on top of the refrig to put all the chips and snacks in so they are not all over the kitchen. Even on a packed July 4th week we were able to find parking right under the condo. The washer and dryers are only steps away and it was nice to be able to wash our beach towels and swim suits daily.
You can have chair and umbrella service by the day or week provided by the resort. It was a bit pricey, but well worth it to us not to have to pack up all that stuff every day. There are bike rentals in the resort as well. Cool trolly service provides rides all over the island if you do not want to drive. It was a wonderful stay and we have already decided to come back next year."

We were right on the beach and a very short walk to the pool, which is great if you have little ones in tow.

I have been coming to this resort since I was young and have stayed at many different units over the years and the view you have from your balcony of this property is unreal! My parents stayed in this particular unit prior to Chad purchasing and renovating and the updates Chad made really brought it to the next level! We had booked our reservation before the new upgrades were completely done so we booked based on the view alone and the few pictures that were available. Chad sent pictures every few weeks to update us on the progress that was being made which was super nice of him! The villa was extremely clean and the perfect amount of space for the two of us. We can’t wait to stay here again in the future and would definitely recommend this property to friends, family, or anyone looking for a a relaxing beach getaway!"

Stayed about a week","My wife and I were looking for a week beach getaway with incredible views and the Ocean Overlook did not disappoint! The units recent renovations are incredibly nice and you can’t get any closer to the beach. Besides the proximity to the beach, my favorite part of this unit was being able to watch the sunrise in the mornings and then the high tide roll in during the evenings from the spacious 3rd floor corner patio.
If the views and renovations aren’t enough, Chad, the host, was hands down the most hospitable host We’ve ever dealt with on Air BnB. From the time I booked to the time we left, Chad was incredibly helpful and genuinely wanted us to enjoy our vacation. Prior to our trip, Chad was even kind enough to spend 20 minutes speaking to me reviewing amenities and other recommendations on the Island.
If you are looking for a luxurious beach getaway then this is the place for you!"

Stayed a few nights","You can hear the waves gently lapping the shore as you enter Chad's condo. The view is absolutely breathtaking, but the benefits of staying in the condo do not end there. Chad has literally thought of every detail. The condo is beautifully appointed and it is evident that much careful planning and meticulous thought went into every inch of space. You will want for nothing staying at Chad's condo. In addition to the space itself being above and beyond expectations, Chad is an incredible, thoughtful, and responsive host. He includes information and FAQs on every question you could possibly have. He checked in with us to ensure we were satisfied and to see if we needed anything additional. The level of service he provides is truly commendable and beyond anything I have ever experienced at previous AirBnB stays. Just as an example, we foolishly forgot some personal items at the condo. Chad was immediately responsive and offered to ship our items back to us. He did not berate us for being nuisances and was so kind despite the inconvenience to him. I could rave about Chad and our stay in perpetuity. However, I believe I have painted enough of a picture. In short, you MUST stay here!!!! Thank you a thousand times over for a truly magical vacation, Chad!"

Everything is as advertised and as shown in the pictures.

Right next to shops, a popular restaurant, general store and ice cream shop on one side and right across from a peaceful beach on the other side. We spent our nights walking to get ice cream and then over to the beach to see the dolphins. The condo is within the Sea Pines area which has everything you need! Lots of playground areas if you’re traveling with kiddos.
The house is extremely clean the beds and pillows are so comfortable, and the shades make everything nice and dark at night. There are extra linens and a ton of amenities including things for the beach and a ton of items for kids (pack and play, booster seat, cutlery and more). We’ll be back!! A perfect stay! Thanks Kim!"

Kim was a great host and quick to respond to any questions I had. The location is great - the building backs up to the pathway to the beach.

The location is stellar with plenty to walk to - we loved walking to the Salty Dog for lunch and it was a quick hop over to the beach! Kim’s place is clean and comfortable with many of the amenities of home. We enjoyed playing cards and drinking a glass of wine on the porch each evening in the rocking chairs overlooking the water. Thank you for a wonderful stay! We hope to be back next year!

For beach lovers- the beach gets a high tide and low tide every 6 hours we were told. During low tide beach was wonderful. Calm, found starfish, lots of blue crabs, hermit crabs, saw dolphins, perfect for kids. High tide meant no beach sand at all, we walked towards the blue tower beach, which also had amenities like bathrooms and was about a 10 min walk from the place. The bay is perfect for fishing and felt like we were on a lake which kids enjoyed anyways.
It was easy to book a banana boat ride, kayak tours and paddle board tours right from the marina by salty dog cafe.
Kim’s place was comfy and had everything you may need."

The bay is spectacular. We saw dolphins, plenty of birds & the sweetest little bats who pop out occasionally late at night. They have zero interest in people so don’t freak out. Just enjoy watching their flights. The deer were lovely. We watched a whole family of them throughout our stay. The fawn was obviously our favorite. There are so many places to eat within a 5 minute walk. If you don’t want to walk, plenty of restaurants will deliver to you. Our ABSOLUTE favorite delivery place is called Local Pie Woodfired Pizza. We ordered salads, pasta, pizza….pretty much half of the menu. Every item was delicious & fresh. I could go on and on about how wonderful this location is. The best compliment I can give is we’d go back a hundred times over if we could."

Stayed a few nights",Overall we really enjoyed our stay! There is a house fairly close to the deck but mostly feels private. The views are unmatched and ultimately I think that’s what you are paying for. Our last full day we saw dolphins and 5 deer that came up close to the house. There were also a bunch of little lizards out around the deck which was cool to see! The sunsets from the house/deck are beautiful. The house was clean and the bed/linens were comfortable. The kitchen mostly had everything you would need to make meals. There isn’t a ton of silverware. We were only 2 people so if you are a bigger group and plan on eating a lot of meals at the house I would just suggest bringing plastic silverware or be prepared to be washing dishes/running the dishwasher often. This was not a reflection of the house but there was construction going on 2 of the 3 days near the house which was loud and took away from the atmosphere a bit. Overall enjoyed our stay. Would come back again and recommend to others!

The sunsets were beautiful here and it was extremely peaceful. Though it is a little treehouse, it was so cozy and never felt too small even though there were 4 of us and a great dane puppy. Our guest contact was beyond helpful and sweet. It was very clean as well! Would recommend 100%!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I booked this for our anniversary. The very first thing we noticed is the amazing view of the intercoastal. Not only is the view incredible from the top deck, but it just as beautiful on the lower deck and from the inside of the treehouse. No matter what room you are in, the view is mostly of the water. The treehouse has everything you could possibly need, and it was very clean. One of the things that we both appreciated was that all of the bedding from the sheets to the pillows were fresh and clean. The sheets were very soft, and the pillows were newer. The best part of our stay was all of the wildlife on the island. One evening when we were enjoying the sunset, we had five deer come right up to the lower deck. Amazing!! The water views and all of the wildlife from the deer to the dolphins, and all of the different birds makes this treehouse so peaceful that you do not want to leave. Kathleen was great when it came to communication and was very helpful."

Stayed a few nights","The location of this place is wonderful. The view of the water and wildlife is stunning. The ability to walk to downtown Harbortown and some restaurants was a pleasant surprise. All of the area activities are walkable, bikeable or a short car ride away. We never left Sea Pines. The host was very good at communicating with us and offered plenty of good recommendations for local restaurants and activities. The building itself was unique and adorable. The only negative is that it was smaller than I was anticipating which made storing our belongings challenging, and not much room for keeping non-perishable food or cooking. My family of 4 prefers a little more room to spread out. Everything else was amazing and I would highly recommend this rental to those who have small families or don't prefer to have a little space."

We saw dolphins and friendly deer daily and couldn’t stop staring at the views from just about every corner of the house. I also can’t say enough good things about our host Kathleen. She was proactive and responsive and just a joy to communicate with.

There are multiple restaurants, shops, a coffee shop, and the HH lighthouse within blocks of the home. We drove to different beaches and none took more than 20 minutes to get to. The backyard is stunning - we saw a family of deer and lots of dolphins.
Kathleen was a great host; she provided a lot of useful tips and was very responsive.
It only took us 50 minutes to drive from the Savannah hotel we stayed at prior to our stay in HH, which was an added bonus."

Dolphins, deer, raccoons and all sorts of birds. It felt like you were secluded and yet the Lighthouse and all amenities were just across the small bridge. We spent a good bit of time just exploring Deer Island during our daily strolls and bike rides. Each evening, we'd relax in the glow of our fire pit while enjoying the picturesque sunsets. We were able to enjoy with the whole family, including our puppy dog, Millie, who enjoyed early morning walks on the secluded beach. Cannot wait to go back...."

Stayed a few nights","Lovely high end sea house. Deer island is an unusual little piece of natural space right next to the touristy harbor town. The drive through sea pines is so pretty. We thought we’d spend time biking and touring but there was no need. The house is perfectly positioned for bringing your picnic back to the house. No beach but we didn’t mind. Wonderful little kitchen and bathrooms, fantastic bed and bedding. The view from the sea house looking over the grasses is full of marsh ducks, herons, some deer and little boats on the water. Fire pit was great, friendly and unobtrusive neighbors. Relaxing space for adults. Harris teeter grocery store had everything we needed and we cooked in every day and night, including firewood, fire starters, and wine. Wonderful for staying in but being immersed in nature, especially for 2 people. If getting out and about is your intention, then 4 would be ok too"

My only words of advice to future guests are to careful of ticks/lyme disease. The house is located on Deer Island with a lot of high grass and deer. We found them throughout our stay so be extra careful not to wander off any trails. Or come prepared with permethrin, a tick-repellent you can buy for cheap on Amazon.com.
The host was very helpful as well."

Let start with the sunset view- it’s quiet, the tide comes up, we could watch the parasailers, boats, and birdlife from the deck and from inside, as well as a nightly sunset visitor from a friendly deer. THREE outside seating areas for dinner and sunset views. Kids could bike to Harbour Town’s playground and we could walk to ice cream, dinner, and shops. Yet a quiet place tucked on the sound, very private. The place itself- amenities and finishes are 5 star. It is comfortable for a family of four and our dog. It’s got a hammock, bikes, nice beach chairs and a guitar, beautiful touches to make our stay comfortable. Water pressure- check. Linens and bedding- check. Cleanliness- check. Kitchen supplies- check. Owner was more than responsive and accommodating. When we returned home, our 7 yr old and 10 yr old exclaimed this trip was better than Disney World, now that’s saying something! Overall, this place is a GEM and worth the long review :)"

Wonderful beach for shelling as well. The whole complex was casual and relaxing with two outdoor pools, pond, indoor pool, sauna, jacuzzi, tennis courts. Theresa offered so many thoughtful amenities in her condo: beach chairs, beach umbrella, binoculars, sound machine to lull you to sleep, fully equipped kitchen, spacious shower, excellent selection of books, reference guides and local history. Condo was comfortable, clean and beautifully decorated. Check in and out was a breeze. The view from the balcony was the best on the island.

Stayed a few nights","This condo is on the second floor of a 3 story building overlooking the water. We enjoyed watching the painted buntings, cardinals and nuthatches behind the condo as well the shorebirds roosting on the sandbar and regular visits from a bald eagle. The condo was located a short drive away from many wonderful restaurants and golf courses. Highly recommend if you are looking for a quiet, beautiful location to enjoy sunrises over the water. Teresa was very responsive when a problem arose (beyond her control) and went above and beyond to correct the situation."

Stayed about a week","The view from Terry’s balcony is amazing. We loved getting up each morning to have coffee, watch the sunrise, and look out for wildlife, including shore birds, cardinals, deer, and even a bald eagle who regularly stopped by. Walking the beach at low tide is a unique experience. Just a little note that If you are a very light sleeper, the floor directly above the bedroom squeaks loudly when walked upon. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Im picky about where I choose to lay my head and spend my money and Theresa's place is so great and exactly like the pictures. The only thing that threw me off was I had no idea that this was a high tide/low tide area. I couldnt enjoy the beach as planned each day I was there but thats on nature though, not on Theresa. Also, this is on the second floor, so plan for that in case ur expecting a lower level. The residents around us were so nice and welcoming. If you plan to cook she has everything you need, plenty of silverware, pots/pans and a Keurig. The table outside was perfect for sipping my hot chocolate while watching the tide come in. The bed was comfortable. Theresa made sure to make this place as comfortable as possible, the little details she made are great down to the little bars of soap and even the make up mirror. The labeling of the switches was extremely helpful. Because of the location of the condo I will definitely book here again but for a summer stay this time."

She clearly went above and beyond to make the condo comfortable. The balcony view over Port Royal Sound provided us plenty of opportunities to watch the tidal changes, sunrises, birds, deer, and even dolphins! The Spa at Port Royal Sound is close to great food options (Hudson's Dockside Seafood was our favorite), coffee, groceries, walking trails, bike rentals, and of course walking the beach. We're just sad we couldn't use the outdoor pools being it out of season!"

Stayed a few nights","Theresa’s condo was perfect for our anniversary stay! The natural beach might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but we loved it. We had to get used to how drastic the tides changed the overall beach, but no matter if the waves were up to the dunes or out a 10 minute walk, we loved all of the little wonders that were uncovered with the changes. Having that close of beach access at any time of the day was amazing. The condo was clean and lovely, had every amenity we needed, and had written instructions everywhere that made us feel secure and right at home. We opted to make breakfast there 2/4 mornings! There were beach chairs, beach towels, camping chairs, plenty of extra linens, toiletries…so much was provided that even if you forgot something or didn’t totally prepare for the beach the way you should have, Theresa had you covered. We would love to return sometime. Thanks for an easy and relaxing stay!! 🥰"

Stayed with kids","I thoroughly enjoyed my morning coffee with an amazing view. The condo was thoughtfully decorated with a coastal theme. It’s a compact space, but the view makes up for that. It was a comfortable stay for my family of 3. We had a few meals on the front porch which beat any seaside restaurant view. Comfortable king size bed and a spacious shower. Well-equipped kitchen. Nice condo and great host.
Natural beach is great if you enjoy exploring, seeing various sea creatures (hermit crabs, blue crabs, horseshoe crabs, several fish, and a few dolphins spotted in the distance, and tons of coastal birds). There’s a flower garden in front of the condo on the first floor and it attracted so many beautiful birds. If you want more of a sandy style beach, it’s to the left of the pier. We switched back and forth during our stay. When the tide is low, the water goes out very far, so it’s easy to spread out.
Tip-Be prepared there’s no elevator and it’s on 2nd floor of building. We kept our beach chairs and wagon in the trunk of our car to avoid carrying it up the stairs."

Plush beach towels, everything we needed to go down to the beach in comfort--chairs, an umbrella, etc. A super getaway location close to everything yet feeling off the beaten track. Terry is a great ""communicator"" and checked on us a couple of times just to make sure we were sailing along :) We'd come back in a heart beat."

Stayed a few nights","We are so grateful for our stay at Terry’s villa. The private beach views are incredible and getting up early to see the sunrise is a must. The villa had all the amenities we needed to make breakfast and coffee in the morning, do laundry, and more!
Terry is also wonderful in terms of communication and checking in on how you are doing!
The villa is very close to the Hilton Head Airport, as well as the local winery and distillery. We didn’t end up visiting any of the public beaches at Hilton Head because of the private beach at the villa!
One of the things we wish we had done on the island is rent a bike. You really can get almost anywhere on the island by bike because of the island’s pathway system.
Would love to schedule a future visit to the villa!"

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights here last week and would absolutely stay here again.
Teresa is a fantastic hostess... she is very quick to respond to any questions, and she provides very detailed information about check-in and parking and amenities and many other little details that make getting settled into the condo quick and easy.
There is a lovely view, the condo is well-decorated, and the bed is extremely comfortable. Also, the blinds in the bedroom are excellent so if you want to sleep in just close the bedroom door and sunlight will not wake you up.
Only two cons to consider: although there is plenty of hot water, the water pressure is poor. And parking close to Theresa’s condo is a bit challenging during the late afternoon and evening. This is because it is at the back of the parking lot right near the beach and there is less parking there. To me it’s a worthwhile trade off to have an ocean view, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
Definitely a lovely place and a relaxing getaway!"

The location was convenient to everywhere we wanted to visit while in Hilton Head. Theresa also provided a binder full of information on the island. The condo was an extremely clean and updated space. My favorite space however was the balcony, I could have spent all day there.

What we loved most about this location is it is near multiple important historic sites, particularly Mitchelville. Mitchelville is the first self-governed, thriving town of free Africans in America - https://exploremitchelville.org/history. Besides being a nice vacation location, we learned a lot about the history of African Americans in the area."

The small but perfect kitchenette had just about everything needed for breakfast and lunch but may be a little challenging for an all-out dinner. We had a couple of friends over for lunch and it was do-able but a tad small. This condo would be best for a couple who will be dining out and breakfasting in. For this is was absolutely perfect. The view is not exceeded by ANYWHERE else on Hilton Head Island and it was for this reason we chose it and it did not disappoint! The access to the ocean is perfect and not to be underestimated.

The apartment itself had everything we needed to cook (although we brought a little too much to fit in the fridge), as well as being clean, nicely furnished and styled, with a comfortable king bed, and hot shower. We enjoyed the Jazz Corner and mini golf, both approx. a 10 minute car ride away, longer walks on the nearby beaches, and a quick visit to the nearby brewery which is an easy bike ride away. Thank you Theresa for giving us the opportunity to enjoy Christmas at the beach in your lovely apartment!"

There was a nice collection of books, especially on local history, plus recommendations for the area (restaurants, activities, grocery stores). The sunsets were stunning in the mornings! Loved having beach chairs to use. The mattress was on the soft side, so my husband ended up sleeping on the couch. We also could hear some noise from the upstairs unit at times. Otherwise, it was a nice space, great value & quiet location."

Her eye for detail was very much appreciated to make our 10 year anniversary trip so perfect. The place is so clean and she has set up everything to be so convenient and comfortable. The kitchen was so handy and she provides everything you need to cook in. The bathroom is so nice as well, very nice big shower. The pictures don’t give that view justice. Quiet surroundings made it very peaceful to sit out on private balcony. The beach and pier were such pleasant walks even in the cooler setting. The location of the condo on the island was so easy to get to everything. Local attractions she suggested were well worth the visits. If we get the chance will definitely come here again! Such nice new memories thanks to Theresa!"

They ask you to help keep it that way, and you get it! It's lovely for 2 people. We will definitely stay here again. It was perfect and exactly our ideal location and vibe. Its like renting from friends...you want be asked back! Be sure to pack beach towels- it's the only thing you'd want but they don't provide. But I will gladly bring my own towels if I can just stay here!"

Standard airbnb guest requirements (run dishwasher, take out trash, etc.). Only downsides: the bed squeaks, and check-in/check-out are 4pm/10am but they clearly use this time to make the place super clean. The beach chairs and umbrella provided are so convenient too!"

Stayed a few nights","Great location, however the overall cost is too much for a short stay. After all the fees and taxes the price was crazy. We didn’t have good weather so it was good that the resort offered things to do other than the beach. The photos posted makes it seem like you can see the beach from the balcony but it’s not the best view, all you can see is a dune. The room is on the first floor near the exit (parking lot) so you get a lot of the noise when someone is coming past your room. When you “check in” make sure you go to the front desk before you drive to the security booth to get your pass, they’ll make you turn around."

Stayed one night","Location location location. You can't stay much closer to the beach than this. Space is at a premium here and this unit covers all the bases in a compact footprint. The popular beach here on Hilton Head is soft and pleasant to walk on. This makes for a comfortable and kid friendly beach experience.
This resort is also popular and the wooden construction tends to convey noise from other occupants a bit more than I would like. Some folk are just noisy. We didn't try out any of the restaurants in the resort but I expect they are all of good quality.
Most of what you're paying for with this unit is the premium location. if you want to have this view and have this kind of access to the beach at Hilton Head this is probably one of the best deals you'll find. If the location isn't your primary concern, this stay might not be the right bang for buck for you."

The unit opens into the bedroom so that you must carry all beach/pool gear through the entire space to reach the balcony. Use the outdoor showers/faucets as instructed before going back inside. This helps but you'll want to sweep at least twice a day.
Thermostat is a bit high maintenance. My son was unexpectedly able to join us for one night. Though I'd thought I'd read there is free additional parking on site, we were told he’d have to pay $275 or be towed. My husband was unceremoniously told there is no fishing allowed on the property even though, according to signage, it’s allowed at the pond near the gym. Not ideal for late sleepers but who wants to stay inside at the beach?!
Would stay again!"

Stayed about a week","The unit was very nice and while I knew it wasn't big, it was even smaller than I'd expected. Understand my wife and I were traveling with our 16 year old son. You enter the unit from the bedroom which we took and he slept on the pullout in the living room area. That area is compact enough that the bed takes up the whole room and literally blocks the slider and is almost on top of the kitchen to boot. So if you are ok being cozy, this place checks all the other boxes! The place was very clean, super organized and there were many starting supplies from the moment we entered the unit. The view was great and you cannot beat the proximity to the beach. That made it very easy to run back and forth from the beach to the unit to make lunch, use the bathroom, etc. Also it is very easy to get from the parking on either side of the building to this first floor unit, so getting our luggage or any other supplies into the condo was a snap. Anyway, we'd stay again for sure!"

Stayed about a week","The condo was everything my wife and I were looking for. It was very clean, and well stocked with all the creature comforts of home. You have a great view of the ocean right from your patio and you can listen to the waves crash into the beach as you are enjoying your morning coffee or afternoon libations.
The condo is stocked with all the necessary beach supplies (chairs, umbrella, cooler, and boogie boards). The condo has two pools. There is a small one the other side of the building, and then the main pool is near the front entrance. There is a fully stocked bar that also serves food next to the pool. They serve great drinks.
The pictures in the ad are spot on and exactly represents what the condo looks like. It was big enough for my wife and I, but it would be a little crowded with more than three persons. Communication with Mike was very easy and he always got back to us in a very short time. If you are looking for a relaxing, stress free vacation on the beach, look no further. I highly recommend booking with Cindy, Bob, and Mike. My wife and I will certainly return."

Stayed over a week","Everything here is just as described in the listing. The horizon view of the ocean was nice while eating breakfast out on the balcony. The unit is literally a few steps away from the boardwalk that leads out onto the beach. Everything we needed was provided, especially in the kitchen, so while there are lots of nice restaurants, we were able to cook our own meals as well. One thing I really liked was the fact that the front windows are covered at this unit. Other units have a wide window in the middle of the front room and one of those vertical skinny windows next to the door. Unfortunately, the way these resort rooms are, the bedroom is that front room next to the door. I see other units in this resort complaining that there's way too much light due to the lighting, but not ours! We had a nice, pitch-black bedroom, and for that I was grateful.
The provided beach chairs, umbrella, umbrella anchors, etc allowed us to have a great time on the beach. They provided many amenities, so we had things like K-cup makers, toaster, many pots and pans, tupperware, tons of cooking utensils. Paper towels, toilet paper, basic toiletries, all provided. We stayed for two weeks so we went through the initial load and bought our own refills but if you're only staying the weekend it should be more than you need.
This made for a great honeymoon and we're grateful to our hosts for a good stay."

There were 4 beach chairs, 2 boogie boards, and a couple of umbrellas. We really didn’t even need to bring much so I definitely overpacked. The kitchen even had containers and sandwich bags and foil and some extra spices which was very helpful. There were 2 pools, one which was smaller but within walking distance and less crowded so it was perfect for us since I had an infant with me. The beach was right across and your on the bottom floor so it was very convenient. I will say the place was smaller than I expected but that may have been me overlooking the pictures and details. It was perfect for my family of 4 with a 6 year old and infant. We just brought an air mattress for the 6 year old and set it up in the bedroom so she wouldn’t have to sleep with us and we could stay up later in the living area. If you need anything or have questions, Cindy and Bob and Mike were very easy to get in touch with and were happy to help. Overall, we had a fantastic vacation and would definitely come back!!"

At night, the building was very quiet and if you had the doorwall open, you could hear the ocean. My only suggestion is that you bring your TV app's login information (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, etc.) with you. The TV's are great, but it was tricky finding a way to view, without my logins, which were at home. The condo unit is small, but perfect for 2 people!

Found this place and went for it! It was SO relaxing! It was just the 2 of us, so plenty of space! Downtown Savannah and Hilton Head was beautiful, plenty of restaurants, stores, good fishing, wonderful wetlands area nearby we walked through, friendly area! Around an 45 minute' drive to Savannah, which was great! Then came back to this place at night and relaxed! Cupboards were plenty stocked and the home was extremely CLEAN! When communicating with Karen via Air BNB, we ""clicked"" instantly--even though it wasn't face to face! Was hoping we could meet her, but didn't work out :(.

Stayed a few nights","There was nothing I needed to request from the host as everything I would need was available from shampoo to dryer sheets. I reported a minor issue and Karen was quick to address and rectify the issue. I could not have been a more relaxing get away. Beach within 2 blocks and everything I would need at the beach was available from beach towels to chairs to cooler. Great restaurants and shopping within a few miles. Amazingly, luxurious and comfortable linens. Will definitely stay again when in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Karen is a super host for a reason - the absolute best stay we’ve had at an AirBnb. The walk to the beach is an easy 5 min walk to an area that isn’t as crowded as other parts of the beach and the house is located in an area that feels secluded from the rest of the island. The unit was spotless from top to bottom and Karen provided many recommendations on the island from food to activities. I could go on and on, but I’ll leave it at that and say if she has vacancy for the dates you’re looking at a stay on HHI, book it with Karen, you won’t regret it!"

She has thought of every detail—toiletries, a couple of bottled waters, cream and sugar for coffee, coffee pods. It is nicer than the pictures show. The linens and furnishings are high quality and CLEAN. The apartment is in a very safe area with a short walk to the beach. The beach chairs and bikes that were provided made this a perfect stay. We will definitely book here again!"

The bike trail is easily accessible, running right through the neighborhood, which we really enjoyed. Karen was great with communication - before, during and after our stay. Check-in was also very easy and flexible, which worked well for us since we had a late arrival and did not need to rush or worry. We have stayed in quite a number of Airbnb rentals and this ranks up there as one of our best!"

The apartment was clean and had everything we needed from kitchen items to beach items. The walk to the residential beach was nice and close but was a little challenging while carrying everything. I would recommend bringing a little wagon or dolly if you have one to make that walk easier. The beach itself was lovely and not crowded at all. I wish we had stayed longer and will definitely consider staying again on our next trip to Hilton Head!

Karen even had things that I forgot to bring myself. I also love the bikes, especially for those that may not want to walk the 5 minutes to the beach on a quiet safe neighborhood. Road the bike two miles up the beach to the rocks, and they were great photo opportunity, as well, as fishing for those that desire. During the summer there will be mosquitos, so be prepared. :) Hilton Head Island is a beautiful island, but more amazing that Karen's place was perfect for it. It was away from the crowds but not far from the beach at all. Will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful place to stay for a couples getaway and I highly recommend! My husband and I recently stayed here for a week for our first visit to Hilton Head. I wanted a place that was very clean, short walking distance to the beach, close to everything, and with a full kitchen to cook some meals - This hit all of those points! You’re a 7min walk to private beach access (much less crowded than the public beach areas). She has thought of everything that you will need for the beach (chairs, umbrella, towels, coolers, tote bag) so all you need to bring is sunscreen and some drinks. We were very comfortable there all week and felt right at home."

Its a very quick walk to the beach (even quicker bike ride.) She also provides a lot of things I didn’t even think of— chairs, boogie boards, and plenty of beach towels. My trip was pretty spontaneous and she had everything I forgot. If I ever have a couple’s trip back to Hilton Head Island I will choose Karen’s place again.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I hadn't been to Hilton Head, specifically Harbour Town, more specifically Cutter Ct, since 1987 so the opportunity to relive some wonderful long-ago memories proved priceless. The location is convenient and the view speaks for itself. You're in Harbour Town 24x7 when you stay here... not just visiting Harbour Town. Perfect for 2 people, the villa takes advantage of it's orientation with terrific sunset views that not only look gorgeous over the Calibogue Sound, but brighten up the inside."

Plenty of shops, restaurants (some that even accommodated my shellfish & fish allergy), live music and of course, the views…we can’t say enough about the view. My husband and I would happily come back to this little gem!"

Stayed a few nights","This was an excellent place to stay/live, it was just like being at home. The view of the harbor town lighthouse was beautiful in the morning and in the evening. This will be the first place I will look for on my next trip to Harbour Town, when it’s a trip for two. Greg gave detailed instructions to the location, gaining access inside, and the location of everything I needed within the unit. While out of Greg’s control, I was unable this trip to purchase a week parking pass and I had to pay for a daily parking pass each day, with cash. This is a prime location for a couple or a family with two children."

It was so fun to walk down to the pier and watch the dolphins in the morning and everything was within walking distance! Loved sitting out in the balcony and enjoying the view. The balcony was very tiny but still amazing! Would love to come back again!

Stayed a few nights","This location could not be more perfect. Greg was super responsive and super accommodating, even allowing a late checkout. I’d note that we were able to access the beach club by car as long as you are dining at Coast. We did not need to use the trolley system which seemed like a hassle. I imagine you need to use that or bike when it gets busier later in the summer. Bikes rent for about $30+ per day and it felt too long to bike down there.
The balcony is great for a view but I could not stick the table up while also sitting comfortably. It is a very tight space in the balcony. My other issue of note would just be that the ice machine never froze any ice.
Greg provided toiletries and helpful instructions."

Absolutely great location in Harbour Town with sunsets directly over the famous lighthouse and lot's of walkable shops and restaurants for all ages. Our dolphin tour launched right out of the harbour too. The famous Harbour Town Golf Course is directly across the street. Plenty to do...golf, tennis, pool, etc. My family had a great time.

Suzanne sent an email a few days before check-in with instructions and a link to a Digital Guidebook which gave lots of information about their place and, also, the island. The Guidebook even gave detailed instructions with pictures about how to operate eachTV in the condo. This was a big help. My 90 plus year old Mother loved sitting on the balcony watching activity at the pool and ocean views. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","What an absolute treat it was to stay here. The views were spectacular, the (newly renovated) pool was fantastic, and the wider community was a joy to explore. We could not have been more pleased with the rental.
We have four kids from teens down to age 7 and there was so much to enjoy. It was incredibly family friendly- the kids loved playing/walking on the beach, swimming endlessly in the pool, riding bikes for miles and miles, and walking up to the general store. It was safe and easy for the kids to go off on their own to get to the store for snacks/meals.
We would love to have the chance to return. The rental made for such an easy and relaxing vacation. Would recommend to any other family looking for a fun time on Hilton Head."

They were also very responsive when we needed anything, they also very flexible and allowed late checkout when we needed to store luggage for a few hours. Only complaint we had was the pool was getting reonavated so we were woken up every morning to the sound of saws and construction but that was out of their control. I am sure when the pool is done it will be great."

Stayed with kids","Stayed here for a family beach vacation and the place was great. The property is located right on the beach and has a nice outdoor pool. The best amenity though turned out to be the clubhouse, which has a gym and an indoor pool with hot tub and sauna. We had a couple of days of chilly beach weather and the indoor pool saved the day.
The unit itself was nice. Both bedrooms have clear views of the pool and beach. Both bedrooms also have outdoor balconies. They are perfectly positioned to see the sun rise. All appliances and televisions in working order.
Would highly recommend staying here."

Stayed with kids","Suzanne’s condo was an AMAZING stay for my family. First off, the condo’s location is prime beach front access. We loved being on the first floor, with an easy elevator ride or a quick flight of stairs to access it. We had wonderful ocean and pool views. We were always able to find parking directly underneath our unit which was easy access for us. The condo’s layout was perfect for two couples and an infant. We were on separate ends which allowed for privacy but then when we wanted to meet in the living room, was so cozy. The kitchen and living room was the perfect space for all of us to hang out. The condo was extremely clean, comfy beds, and exactly as photos show. The location of the condo is also a great location to visit north or south of the island. I highly recommend Suzanne’s condo if you are looking for a visit to Hilton Head Island! She was fast to respond, provided so much information for our stay, and accommodated us so well. Thank you again! We will be back!"

We enjoyed the sunrises & sunsets right from the balcony or with a short walk to the beach! The condo was clean and nicely updated. Great location! We were able to visit Old Town Bluffton, Daufuskie Island and Savannah during our stay. Tons of restaurants in the area and plenty to do! Suzanne was very responsive from start to finish! The “Guidebook” link was a big help….very professional! We will definitely be back!"

All of the tvs and AC worked perfectly - no issues at all. I also loved having three balconies - plenty of space for everyone to spread out and enjoy the wonderful views. Being on the first floor was great with small kids so they could be easily seen in the pool at all times. Suzanne was a great host - super responsive and everything was just as advertised. Location was perfect - right near Alexander’s, the general store and the Outfitters…. Not to mention ocean front! Thanks Suzanne!"
