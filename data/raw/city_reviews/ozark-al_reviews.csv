Stayed a few nights","This place is fantastic, and Larry is a wonderful host - friendly, helpful, and responsive. The place was perfect for my two-day stay, but I could have stayed much longer if needed. It has everything you need and it was spotless when I arrived. I debated between this place and another location, and after seeing both in person, I'm really happy that I chose this place. I'll book this stay again anytime I return to Enterprise. Thank you, Larry, for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","‘The Sanctuary’ – Another One of Larry’s Must See / Stay at properties!
I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this lovely, comfortable, secluded, peaceful and fully-equipped rental. Not only does this rental include all the large/small appliances (i.e. washer/dryer, microwave, etc.), the Host has also anticipated the needs of his Guests, exquisitely I might add, by paying close attention to the small details: i.e. – designated/free parking, bottled water, make-up remover wipes, a Guidebook, written details regarding heating/cooling, Wi-Fi access, card games and even old-school board games (i.e. Trouble, Chutes & Ladders).
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at The Sanctuary, and/or one of Larry’s other properties, as well. You’ll be glad you did!"

Stayed a few nights","We arrived in the dark, and Larry met us to give us some instructions. He then escorted us to the apartment and explained the lock system, the heating system and the cargo lift. This was valuable information to us.
I was able to use the apartment kitchen to make my Thanksgiving sides for the dinner at my daughter’s a short drive away. Everything worked so well in the kitchen for me.
The apartment is decorated with a couch in my favorite color, red. That was a plus! The bed was comfy and the shower water pressure was amazing. This is a place we want to return to for another visit.
We recommend the restaurant, The Barrel Room, if you visit Enterprise."

Our stay has been longer than expected and Larry has been extremely accommodating and responsive as host. The Sanctuary is well-appointed and extremely clean and the area itself is worth the drive. Big bonus for covered patios and covered car parking, especially during the summer storms! We have loved every minute of our time and highly recommend you stay at any of Larry's AirBnBs!"

Of all the places I have had the pleasure to stay, Larry may be the best communicator of all the hosts I've had, his stay may easily be the best value, and his process and facility ranks among the most professional I have experienced. the location is just a little outside of town, quiet, but not too distant. The apartment was modern, well appointed, and spotless. I will look to stay again if ever in the area."

Stayed about a week","This Airbnb was a little secluded off the main part of the city but close enough to not have to drive a distance. The home was perfect— clean floors, a cozy bathroom and bedroom, perfectly placed couch and tv distance with a cute kitchen table just perfect for my girlfriend and I. The tub was amazing and the bathroom was perfectly spaced and everything felt so spacious. The addition of a washer and dryer made the entire stay feel even more like home. Larry has a cat that foals around outside and waking up to go to work to see a little cat rub up against your leg made it feel so much more blissful. The parking was spacious and perfectly placed under shelter. It rained so hard and nothing was wet: the car, the porch, the door or stairs— everything has been built to a good standard and the entire trip made me feel like a was home away from home and it was only 95 miles away from the beach! You HAVE to stay here, you will NOT regret it, I promise you!"

Stayed a few nights",I'm hard pressed to find any real negative things about this spot that aren't just personal preferences. The rental was exactly as advertised and the host very easy to work with. I expressed some initial concerns about potential noise based on the pictures and Larry provided ample details and in the end my concerns were unfounded. I will be visiting this area again in the future and I'll be checking Larry's rentals before I look anywhere else.

Larry is top notch in professional responsiveness, organization, preemptive planning, and has thought of everything to make your visit in Enterprise like you don't want to leave. The Sanctuary is furnished with high quality towels & linens, electrical ingenuity, comfortable bed. Impeccably clean. Good location. Exceeding expectations in amenities and space. You will NOT be disappointed."

The space is clean and spacious. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need to make a meal at home.
The internet is fast and you have a variety of TV channels/streaming programs to choose from.
The location is on a quiet street on the outskirts of Enterprise and only minutes from shops, restaurants, and parks. I highly recommend staying here on your next visit to Enterprise."

It was super comfy and cozy for us. We'll definitely look to stay at one of his properties anytime we come to Enterprise to visit my hubby's family. Thanks again for having us, Larry!"

Stayed about a week","Larry's airbnb was one of the best lodging experiences I ever had! As a frequent traveler, I have seen the gamut of good and bad hotels and similar temporary lodgings. Larry's airbnb experience easily stood head and shoulders above almost all of those experiences! Larry and his family were helpful, attentive, and supportive during the stay. The rooms themselves were superbly maintained, clean, and easy to live in. The price per night was reasonable; in fact, given the quality of the lodgings, it was outstanding. I cannot emphasize enough how good of an experience this was. 5/5 stars- I would definitely recommend Larry's airbnb to anyone interested in a high quality lodging experience!"

The kitchen has all you need--(besides the dishes, pans and flatware,) a stove, microwave, toaster oven, k-cup coffeemaker and a full size fridge with an icemaker. The queen bed is in great shape. We didn't need to use the washer or dryer, but they are full size too!
The apartment is on the second floor, and the owner has installed a cargo (cargo, not people) lift, so you don't have to carry your stuff up the stairs. It's a quiet neighborhood and the owner is very attentive; he communicated a lot and checked in to see if we needed anything.
If we ever get back to Enterprise, we will definitely want to stay here!"

The Host greeted me as I drove up and parked, which was extremely thoughtful...
The only two negative things I have to say about this listing, was when you get in and out of the bed in the bedroom it made a lot of noise, and on the second day we were there the dish detergent in the Dispenser ran out, so Unfortunately I had to use the soft soap that was located in the bathroom. But, Otherwise than that I would stay here again."

Stayed about a week","Larry's place ranks as one of the top Air B&B's we have ever stayed at. It is super clean and spacious. There are two TV's so you can watch in either living room or bedroom. The apartment has a dual zone heating and air conditioning system with remotes so you can change the temperature from the bed and in the living room/kitchen. The washer and dryer are located in the bedroom closet which was super nice. The bbq grill was nice and we cooked out twice during our week stay. We really enjoyed the freight lift and used it bringing our luggage and other stuff for the week up to the apartment. The apartment is nice and quiet and Larry's place is located on a street that dead ends so there isn't much traffic or noise. You have pretty much anything you could possibly need here with a fully furnished kitchen, regular coffee pot, Keurig style coffee pot, fridge with icemaker, electric range and even a dishwasher. We had a very comfortable and pleasant stay and would highly recommend it!"

Stayed a few nights","We travel a lot, and I've entered many Airbnb. I long to be able to enter then relax. Unfortunately, because of my work in the construction industry, my eye for detail and workmanship keeps me from just being. I tend to see everything(bad). I'm sure its mental. Entering this home gave me a unique opportunity to both relax and respect great workmanship. Everything from the rustic log cabin interior to the floor elevation change in the kitchen just so a set of stairs wouldn't look out of place reaching the second-floor kid's loft. Trimming every nook and softening every angle. Knock down ceilings with a flawless 45-degree corner bead. Little lanterns hardwired for accent lighting. Ductless splits installed level and tight to the wall. As one old timer told me years ago. ""If you have no pride in what you're doing, you'll have no shame in doing it poorly."". This home is unique in that way, (forgiving the tile, lol) and it was a pleasure to stay in. Quiet, cozy and relaxing. Thanks again!."

My kids absolutely loved the bedroom space and were so excited about the way it was set up. The pictures don’t do it justice, it looks so much nicer than what you see in the photos. Larry is also a very courteous host and made sure that we were okay with activities he would be doing before doing them.

Stayed one night","‘The Clubhouse’ – An Absolute Must See!
I have had the good fortune of staying at all 3 of Larry’s properties, which are uniquely beautiful in their own way. BUT, I must say that this is, by far, the most well-thought-out and creatively designed rental property that I have ever stayed at. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing with its woodworking style, creativity, design and layout, it is also fully functional / equipped, modern, elegant, comfortable and clearly focuses on the needs of the Guests, by providing a much appreciated attention to detail, in order to ensure all the comforts of home, and then some.
The carpentry, rustic, yet comfortable, furniture and décor, coupled with the modern and elegantly styled kitchen, with all the amenities and appliances (small and large), make it an ideal accommodation, which can be appreciated by both men, women and children alike.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at The Clubhouse, for both short and long-term stays. You’ll be glad you did."

The amenities provided were top-notch and everything a guest could need was available. The kitchen was well-stocked with all the necessary utensils and appliances, making cooking and preparing meals easy. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels and toiletries.
The bed was comfortable and cozy, and I slept soundly throughout my stay. The linens were soft and luxurious, adding to the overall comfort of the space. One of the things that stood out to me was the attention to detail. Everything was thoughtfully arranged and the small touches really added to the overall experience.

We found that in spades with Larry's rental. From the moment we walked in, we were struck by the excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail that he put into creating it. The woodworking, lighting, and decorations were amazing, and all weekend long, we were finding new ""little surprises"" to marvel at. The place was extremely well-appointed, and it was super convenient for everything that we did. The setting that it is in is wonderful as well. A quiet and beautiful country surrounding as viewed from the porch, was the perfect setting to start my day with a cup of coffee, and the tv with surround sound in the living area was the perfect place to finish it. We came away highly impressed and happy with our time spent here"

Once we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Larry with a smile! He and his family participated and it was wonderful! I never could of imagined such amazing hospitality from any Airbnb! The apartment itself I immediately felt comfortable and relaxed when I walked in. It’s a beautiful place and very clean! You definitely get your money’s worth and more! The location is so nice!

The place is custom built, beautiful wood work, with well thought out placement of everything inside. Clear Instructions to the TV with great sound system, labeled remotes, light switches, stocked kitchen, and maximum use of every square inch efficiently. My daughter loves the loft upstairs, and was very excited to be staying here the second time. The beds are also extremely comfortable. We will be back!"

Would highly recommend trying it out for yourself or with children. Really enjoyed sitting on the deck watching the squirrels and birds. 2 friendly cats come keep you company if you let them.

The beds are very comfortable, A/C is cold, and kitchen has everything you could possibly need. I highly recommend this airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","What an outstanding townhouse and location. Several things all played into the 5 star rating. First the townhouse: it was clean, tidy, well appointed and everything was as promised. Two very large bedrooms and large actually doesn’t describe their size well enough. A small but well stocked kitchen and dining table was perfect for breakfasts at the house. We were fortunate to have access to the garage and that was such a plus. Second the communication: absolutely outstanding. Not just timely communications but everything was followed up with another note. A question we had was replied to within 30 minutes. We really felt that anything we needed would be accommodated if possible. Third is location: if you are there to access Fort Rucker you are less than 5 minutes to one of the gates. We were there for our son’s graduation from flight school and this was PERFECT. Plus we were closer to downtown Enterprise which was nice since it’s such a quaint town. We HIGHLY recommend Sylvia’s AirBNB!"

Communication with Sylvia was easy, as well as check in. we had everything we needed, and enjoyed having the whole condo for our family's stay!

Stayed a few nights","We booked Christy's place and it turned out to be a fantastic stay. We were visiting family in the area and looked for a place that was close to Fort Novosel. Christy's place was a perfect place as a daily launching place for our visit. The suite was only minutes from the base, was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The kitchenette worked well for us as we only had a quick breakfast in the morning and didn't return to the suite until much later in the evening. The suite is spacious and my wife and the bedroom privacy is ensured with a door separating the bedroom from the rest of the suite. Plenty of room for two, we really enjoyed the stay and look forward to booking again for our next visit to the area.
Christy is truly a Superhost! It is obvious that she takes pride in her suite and cares for those who choose to stay here. Great communications, easy check-in and check-out and very respectful of privacy, I wish that I could give more than 5 stars for Christy. Thanks!"

I had an overnight flight and they were generous enough to let me check in earlier. I slept great free of distractions. I loved the extra light at the mirror in the bathroom to help get ready. It was only 5 minutes from Ft Rucker. They had a bookshelf with some books, that if I had time, I would have enjoyed to read. I also love how the couch/loveseat rocked. If I ever go back to Dothan I will definitely request to stay here. Oh and another bonus is they let you park under the carport right next to the door. They even had a diffuser which I use essential oils daily so having that option was amazing to be able to make it feel more like home."

We enjoyed sitting on the screened-in back porch in the mornings listening to the Cardinals while drinking our coffee. The tv was easy to operate. The showers were nice with great pressure in the hall bathroom. I was extremely pleased with the house and if needed, would stay there again. I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"

The only thing I would add is a curtain on the front door. Even though it had beveled glass, headlights still shone through and one of the guests were sleeping in that area. The option have covering at night over that door would be wonderful. Thank you Ivan for a great experience! ~ The Hall Family"

We arrived after dark but the entryway and front door was very well lit which made our entrance to the house very easy and safe. The whole property had only small steps at the thresholds which was great for my octogenarian parents with limited mobility. We had access to the double door garage which was very nice and rare. We were happy to be able to park in the garage for added security. Also, the hosts have a treadmill and weight bench in the garage which was nice as an option for those dedicated to working out or walking/running even on rainy days. The house and furnishings were immaculate and tasteful. The home has a supply of games and activities for kids and families. The neighborhood was very walkable and clean. If we’re back in the area, we will definitely stay here again! It was an ideal home away from home."

The home itself is beautifully decorated and has a cozy, inviting atmosphere. You'll feel right at home from the moment you step inside. The screened in porch was lovely and inviting. A great place to relax at the end of the day. The beds were comfortable and the home was well stocked with all of the essentials. I especially appreciated the full size hair dryer!
From the moment I made my booking, the host was quick to respond to my messages and answer any questions. Throughout my stay, the host remained accessible and responsive. This level of attentiveness made my stay all the more comfortable and stress-free.
Overall, this Airbnb is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Fort Rucker or the Enterprise area. With its prime location, cozy atmosphere, and high-tech amenities, it truly feels like a home away from home."

There was plenty of room for all 7 of us to sit comfortably and watch a movie together.

We travel a lot for baseball tournaments and this was our first time staying in an Airbnb and I can promise you we will never stay at a hotel again when we play anywhere near Enterprise! This will be what we rent!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can’t recommend this enough!!!"

The house had everything we could have possibly needed and we didn't have to run to the store for anything during our time there. This is also one of the cleanest homes I've stayed in, by far! We loved the screened in porch and spent many evenings grilling and eating dinner on the porch. The neighborhood is also lovely and very safe, we went on lots of walks around the block during our stay."

Kitchen was well stocked and had plenty of extra trash bags, paper towels, dishwasher pods, cooking spray and some seasonings. And the little stocked coffee bar was a nice touch. Refrigerator was super clean and had an ice maker which is always a plus. We enjoyed our meals on the screened in porch and the gas grill was super nice and new. The beds were super comfortable and the bedding was oh so soft and inviting. There was workout equipment in the garage if you desire to keep fit during your stay. Also plenty of boxed games to entertain yourself with in the evenings and some toys for the youngsters. We had no issues whatsoever and communication with Ivan was great. Don’t hesitate for a second to book your next Airbnb stay with Ivan."

Location is perfect - 2 miles from Boll Weevil Circle making trips out easy. 10 mins from Rucker making it easy for my husband to get to work quickly and maximize our family visit. Plus the neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe. If you enjoy running hills, this is also a great location for that 🤣

We eventually had a glass of wine while sitting on the porch and the birds were singing and the view was very nice. We both slept well and then enjoyed a cup of coffee before checking out. I highly recommend a stay here. This Airbnb definitely catered to the comfort of the guest.

The new appliances in the kitchen are nice but unfortunately overloaded the houses electrical system and popped the circuit breaker when using the stovetop and microwave at the same time. The rooms are well furnished but had some dirty surfaces. The only issue with sleeping is the occasional squirrel in the wall. The owner tried to keep them out with a deterring spray but it only kept them out for one night. Overall a good experience considering the price and amenities available.

Whenever, I visit again I will most definitely be booking with her again. We have no regrets an we were very pleased with our stay. We drove 6hrs from Memphis ,Tn for my sister’s baby shower. We loved everything. It felt so cozy, peaceful and we were able to relax with no worries.

I would give six stars if possible ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The place was in great conditon, and perfect for our visit to our kids, who are stationed at Ft. Novosel, AL. The 2 BR, 2.5 BA was big enough, and private enough for a quiet peaceful stay. The unit was freshly updated had everything we needed to make it a comfortable stay. We appreciated the map of where people had come from to stay here, as well as the guest register for a special touch.
We can't wait to stay here again in about a month when our first grandchild arrives! We can't praise her enough (-:"

Stayed a few nights","Of course! Here's a kind review you can use for Airbnb and owner Sylvia:
---
I had the most wonderful stay at Sylvia's Airbnb! From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and at home. Sylvia is not just a host; she's a true gem who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a fantastic experience.
The accommodations were immaculate, and the attention to detail was remarkable. The cozy bedroom, well-equipped kitchen, and charming living space made my stay incredibly comfortable. Sylvia's home is a true oasis of comfort and relaxation.
What truly sets this Airbnb apart is Sylvia herself. She's not just a host; she's a warm and caring person who genuinely cares about her guests.
I can't thank Sylvia enough for her hospitality and kindness. This Airbnb experience exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait to return!"

Bath towels were plenty and clean! Beds were comfortable and a TV in every room was really nice! We even enjoyed the pool one day.

Stayed a few nights","I have become a regular at Sylvia's listings. She's always very polite and quick to respond. I wanted until the last minute to book for the 4th and had to book 2 of her properties. They ended up being next door to each other. Instead of me having to leave and come back, she accommodated me by cleaning the second property first and allowed me to stay at the first property until cleaning was complete. The second night's stay at this property did come with a small problem with ants in the bedroom, which made me have to sleep in the other bedroom with smaller beds. It's the south and we've had a LOT of rain. Even if you think your house is air tight, they somehow still sometimes find a way in. Sylvia was quick to respond and even refunded me for the incident. I will continue to be a regular."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay here. The beds were very comfortable. I have an over sensitive sense of smell so very often the most objectionable thing about a place will be its smell. There were some air fresheners, but they were mild so I didn't mind too much. The next door neighbor was burning trash when we first showed up. The smell hadn't gotten into the house by that time and we kept the doors shut as much as we could to keep it out, but by the middle of the night it had made its way into the house somewhat. It was still smoldering the next morning so I contacted the host about it and she responded quickly and said that the authorities were on their way. I guess whatever she did worked because the fires were out when we came back that night and we didn't have any more issue with that. It was really more space than we needed, so if we come back to the area I might choose a smaller cheaper place if one is available, but if not I'd be more than happy to stay here again. Thanks for having us."

We vacation and travel often, so we've been to quite a few Airbnb's. Nevertheless, I have to say, Pearl's Cove is one of our favorites this far. It's very spacious and CLEAN with lots of spaces for entertainment or to allow privacy, which was a bonus. I always travel with liquid hand soap for the bathrooms, paper towels Tide pods, and trash bags when renting someone else's home. Well, it was nice to know that many of those things were being provided."

She had yummy coffees, snacks, even got me creamer and milk in the fridge! Precious host, location and experience. If I wasn’t moving to Dothan, I would definitely book again! One detail that’s important to note, there are stairs to get to the apt, so take that into consideration if you have lots of luggage or mobility challenges."

She made sure that me & my mother was extremely comfortable. She was very professional and definitely a people person. Her Airbnb was a beautiful, comfortable, peaceful and I felt safe there.

Great communication and great host 5+ stars no doubt. If you can make it when they open try Big Daddy’s BBQ it was also great. If you go a later some stuff may be sold out.

Air conditioning both upstairs and downstairs, full size stove and fridge, as well as a washer and dryer for both short and long-term stays. In addition to the luxury items, the apartment is truly beautiful and Larry's meticulous attention to even the small details (e.g. the aesthetics/decor, provided games, and covered parking in a safe neighborhood) made my stay an enjoyable one.
I highly recommend staying at Larry’s rental. You will be glad you did! :-)"

It was nice that we had our own private area, no sharing anything with other people. Larry made the check in very easy! If we wanted a no contact it would have happened.

The stairs are steep inside so keep that in mind for small children. My 7 year old thought inside was pretty cool and wanted to “stay forever”.

The house is very quiet and perfect for someone who works or is a light sleeper. The house is sparkling clean and has a full kitchen. Check in is very easy, all doors have codes and it is very easy to figure out. The house is around 15 minutes drive to the town center where you can find grocery and food. Overall my stay was wonderful and I would absolutely stay again. Thank you Sharolyn!"

The main door and bedrooms all have keypads. Access to the kitchen and laundry is available along with complimentary coffee. The whole house is spotless. Parking areas are marked and free. There are notes that provide additional information. It's extremely well organized. I enjoy staying there when I'm passing that way.

Stayed one night","I am a repeat guest at Sharolyn''s place. The last time I stayed in The Cozy Corner room. The Lake Room and Sharolyn's whole place is clean! As in ""Crazy ""wear sunglasses"" clean"". No cats or other pets (except fish in the foyer aquarium).
Organized! Over the top organized! Everything is labeled so you know what is available to you and what any rules about it are. Very reassuring! I never had to ask about anything!
The inside environment was very quiet. The neighborhood is excellent and in the country. There was ample onsite parking.
The bed had a perfect, high quality, medium-soft mattress. I slept very well. Had control of a ceiling fan. The bedroom has a pin-pad lock.
I shared a bathroom with another room but almost didn't see another soul. Bathroom was sparkling clean and stocked with shampoos and soaps. A fluffy towel, hand towel, and washcloth were provided in my bedroom.
I didn't use the common kitchen except for a cup of complimentary Keurig coffee. However, every single cabinet was labeled with its contents for our use. Also, there was designated cabinet storage space in the kitchen labeled for each. The very reasonable usage rules were posted clearly too.
Love this host and home."

Stayed one night","The facility was nice and the stay was overall good. Although, for future residents, do NOT come with more than just yourself. It is stated on the page that it is a single person housing, meaning only one person per room. Unfortunately I did not read that part and my fiancé and I were kicked out the next morning at 6:30 AM. I apologized and offered to pay a fee if necessary because we just got done from a 10 hour drive because I am on pre-deployment leave and we were exhausted from traveling but the owner was not flexible and had us leave immediately."
