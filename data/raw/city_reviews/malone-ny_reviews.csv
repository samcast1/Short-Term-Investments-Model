Stayed with a pet","Had a great weekend stay at Tim’s cabin. What a great place! Super clean and comfortable and what a location! My husband didn’t have a chance to fish right out front of the property, but we both enjoyed drinking coffee and reading on the porch overlooking the river and watching our dog have a great time plodding along in the shallows. Can’t wait to make a repeat visit (or two or three)!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is a gem and Timothy is an amazing host! No pictures can describe the charming sound of the rivers or the the ambience of the place. Timothy thoughtfully filled the cabin with books, items and tools that are both entertaining and practical. His attention to cabin decor and small details are visible everywhere, and from the first sight you can tell that he loves and cares for this place as his own home. Even if you are not into fly fishing, staying here is a wonderful relaxing experience!"

Stayed a few nights","We would happily stay here again. Nothing but natural beauty, peace, and quiet along the Little Salmon River. We made a fire one night with the ample wood at the site, and we grilled another night with the super clean and nearly brand new gas grill. Tim's instructions were very clear on how to find the place (I'm glad we brought the AWD SUV rather than our old Prius; the incline on the drive down to the cabin was steep, leaf covered, one day there was snow, another morning was frost... fun times in late October in the North Country). Cabin was always cozy. Even though the cell service was zero, which we knew it would be, the land line was helpful to reach our family and friends."

Stayed a few nights",I stayed a few days ago and I wanted to leave a review right away but I got caught up showing everyone the pictures of my beautiful stay. It was better then described. My guests and I woke up and went fishing. We had bbq and we’re provided with everything that we needed. My favorite part was the hook maker I’m not even sure what it’s called. I made my own hook and line. Tim left everything we needed and more. The house was clean. It was secluded. It smelled so beautiful when I would wake up and go outside. The breeze really helped on a hot day I didn’t even feel how hot it was. I never wrote a review this long but Tim’s house and his kindness were really appreciated. He made me feel so welcome. He was very understanding and answered all 1000 of my questions. Besides him being so welcoming and kind the house was really beautiful. I would go again next week but he’s booked on the days I’m staying there again. Really would recommend staying here!!!

Stayed about a week","We had a fantastic stay. The cabin is secluded and private, in a forested area, with the river literally feet from the back porch. The porch was a beautiful place to relax. The cottage has everything we needed from kitchen gadgets to linens etc. They've thought of every detail. It also looks fairly newly renovated with a decent size shower, good water pressure, etc. Honestly the photos don't do it justice. A gorgeous place. All designed perfectly with the fisherman in mind. It was great downtime for us, as there's no wifi and limited cell coverage, which was absolutely fine for us. Thanks so much Tim!"

Timothy is a great host; easy to work with and very accommodating, quick to reply, checked on us regularly to make sure we were good to go. Great value for the location, size, and condition!"

The cabin is amazing as pictured, very well equipped, and super comfortable. The fly fishing theme is well done, we enjoyed it very much. Would definitely stay here again just to enjoy the beauty of river, have a fire pit and explore the trails and parks nearby! The owners were wonderful with communication and ensuring we had everything we needed. Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to see the April full totality of the solar eclipse. Stunning setting, cozy cabin, and a hot tub under the stars. We thought we might have to leave the property to see the eclipse, but a pine needle path led us to the perfect spot. The cabin is as well cared for and sweet as the photos show, and the kitchen has plenty of basic cooking items, plus a large outdoor grill. With such a beautiful view, why go elsewhere? There is another cabin on the property, but it’s thoughtfully laid out so both cabins have privacy and their own outdoor spaces. Hosts David & Luis were quick to communicate and respond whenever we had a question/concern; Luis is local to the area and gave us some wonderful tips for hikes and nature spots. If you love the outdoors and want to drink in some beautiful Adirondack scenery, you should enjoy this place as much as we did. Don't forget to do some star gazing!"

The space was very clean, decorated beautifully but simply - a perfect mix between rustic and modern! The views from the big windows looking out back are beautiful and the hot tub was a perfect amenity after being on the mountain all day! Also - the bed was SO soft and comfortable. The mountain was less than a 10 minute drive away, with most bars & restaurants about 20 minutes. We’re already looking forward to coming back and staying here again!"

Stayed with kids","This cabin is pure magic. Nestled in a beautiful wooded area, it has everything you need for a peaceful getaway. We stayed here for 6 days with our two kids and everyone really enjoyed the place, especially the 4-person jacuzzi on the patio. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking utensils if you need to make meals and there are two bathrooms that come in handy in the mornings. The place is very close to Titus mountain which offers plenty of winter activities for the kiddos and it's a short 1.5 hour drive to Montreal. The host and the property manager were great and very responsive. We had no issues at all during our stay. Highly recommend."

Stayed about a week","I can honestly say that you have no worries here. Not every trip goes without a hitch and ours did have some. However, and this is s big HOWEVER. The sense of urgency and agency that Luis showed was impeccable. He was friendly, engaging, and very quick to respond. I have never had a better experience with an owner/operator at any location. I even forgot an incredibly important piece of jewelry behind and Luis made sure it was out in priority mail the next business day and sent me the tracking info.
The cabin itself is just the most adorable space. Well equipped with two bathrooms. Did not expect to be as comfortable in a smaller space but for my wife and I it was perfect. The property is private and very peaceful. The hot tub was lovely and the view was relaxing. Or is it the other way around? There is no way I’ll choose another location the next time I’m in the area."

Stayed a few nights","We were pleasantly surprised with the makeup of David's place (DP). A tremendous amount of love and care went into this house.
If we could give DP 10 stars, we would! David and his team were always responsive to our needs/concerns. Inside, the cabin's decor was rustic but beautifully modern. Sleeps 4. Stocked with everything you will need as if you were in the comfort of your own home. Extremely clean, which we were very happy about. Morning tea on the deck was sooo relaxing. The firepit sitting area is very nice.  DP has lights projected on trees in the back, which is a nice touch while sitting at the  pit. If you're looking to connect or reconnect with nature while relaxing in a hot tub, morning tea on the deck while watching the sunrise/sunset, or sitting by the fire pit, we highly recommend  place.  Trust us, you will not be disappointed. We can't wait to return!"

Stayed with kids","In the pictures, I thought the apartment would be small, but was pleasantly surprised by how big it was. there were two minor things that did not affect our stay whatsoever that I let Michelle know about and she responded promptly. I would 100% stay here again. There was a family staying next door, above our unit with many children and who ran throughout the house and we could hear it loud and clear. If the uncertainty of that bothers you, you may want to ensure you get the unit that has the upstairs but other than a bit of noise at early/late hours, it was tolerable for us and wasn't as loud in our bedroom as it was in the living room. That is not something that can be controlled by the hosts. I have family in Malone and will seek out this property again! It's only 10 minutes to Malone and the best place I've stayed at in all of my stays there."

Stayed with a pet","My mother was dying when I booked this place to see her one more time. That was less than 24 hours before we were due to be there. Unfortunately, she faded fast and was gone before we set foot in the place. She offered to reschedule our dates (to use for the funeral) then said it wasn't possible and refused us a refund. We couldn't cancel 24 hours in advance because we made the booking less than 24 hours in advance. Under the circumstances I thought this was horrible. I ended up getting a partial refund direct from Airbnb. She got to keep the cleaning fee, which I thought was also wrong since we never made it there. If I had it my way, she wouldn't have gotten any stars!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay, it was comfortable. The apartment was open and plenty of space for my wife, myself, our dog and to entertain old friends for a evening. It was great to have this opportunity to have guests over in our vacation rental for dinner, as our dog has anxiety and we didn’t want to cause an upheaval to our friends dog at there home. The kitchen was nice with all spices and dishes that you would need. The appliances are top notch, I loved the toaster too! We did find upon arrival clean dishes in the dishwasher. It was nice to have the ability for extra towels and to be able to use the washer/dryer on hand. The bed was comfortable and clean and we loved the modern decor throughout. Michelle was prompt with getting back to us and even checked to make sure that we got checked in alright. Michelle was helpful and let us extend a night of staying, which we were grateful for as we had some landscaping project in the area to do. Overall, the cozy and comfortable apartment met all our needs and hope to be back to stay again. Oh, and Mo’s Restaurant has really good food! Runnings is the place for all kinds of needs, from clothes to tools and much more. Great area and great host!"

My unit they had available this year was slightly smaller but still 4 times as big as the local dive hotels who actually charge more. Place was clean, modern including all appliances, and well laid out and decorated. I have to give the host credit as I do criticize other places I stay if I feel I was let down. I have nothing but praise for how these host of how they keep there place in A one condition and are more then eager to help me even outside the realms of the actual place. A plus rating in this place. Cannot wait to ho back next year."

Walmart was 5min away, and we got all our grocery there and we cooked most of our meals at the house. Having 2 bathroom was nice too. We would love to stay at her place again."

Stayed a few nights","We had the most amazing time! The location is beautiful, and the house was perfect for my mom and me. It was Easy to find and access and very clean. The backyard with the creek was peaceful and relaxing. The town had great options for local family-owned restaurants and shopping for any last-minute items we needed. We came up for the eclipse expecting huge crowds, but the town was well-prepared, and we did not experience any traffic or large crowds. We took multiple hikes located within 20 minutes of the house, which had amazing vistas and waterfalls. We visited a local Maple farm that had the most delicious Maple Syrup. After long days of local adventures, it was nice to return to the house to warm up and relax. Cell phone service and maps (Apple) worked great, even on our hikes in the woods, which was surprising. I did download maps for the hikes, just in case. The sheets were the softest sheets I ever slept on! We hope to return in the fall for Autumn hiking."

Stayed a few nights","The location was great if you were to go to Titus Mtn. Its about a 15 minute drive to Malone. The view of the river was nice. The house wasn’t very clean. Looked like things were just put in blind spots and a quick clean occured. The closet in the master was stuffed full of old holiday items and cleaning supplies that was just thrown in there. I found multiple items from past guests under the beds. The fridge also had a lot of old items from past guests. The couch in the living room had pet hair on it which may had been the reason for my guests having hives and bites when leaving. The dishes in the cabinets were dirty, we had to clean them before using them. There were multiple dead flies and ladybugs in the windowsills. We got snowed in due to how short the driveway was, the host did not have any shovels, so we had to wait until the next day for a kid with a snow plow to get us out. Also feel like a $125 cleaning fee is a bit much for a place that dirty and is less than 500 sqft."

Stayed a few nights","We arrived after dark, in the rain and GPS was spotty & unreliable at best. When our GPS did work, location accuracy was terrible. As a result we drove around for 2 hours until we finally located the cabin. I would highly recommend arriving while it is still daylight to avoid our misfortune and would even recommend pre-printing directions to the cabin. Once inside, we also struggled with operating the heating system and getting the cabin warm enough, but Craig & Juliana were responsive to our messages. Also, It would have been helpful if the light switches were labeled, since there were several lights & a fan that we were never able to turn off. But the cabin is darling and the river was soothing as well as picturesque. Everything was spotless and well maintained. Overall, we wish we could have stayed longer and would definitely stay there again."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at this house. The house is really beautiful and cosy. The only thing we wish we would have known beforehand is that you cannot access the river, since there is a steep hill leading to it that is filled with bush. So we were a bit disappointed when we arrived, as we had hoped to go fishing there. Also, there is a road with cars driving by regularly right in front of the house (nothing compared to our home situation though), so it is not as 'out in the woods' as we had hoped for. But all that to say: the nature around is beautiful with plenty of places to hike and we totally enjoyed our short vacation here!"

Seina was an awesome host, and even provided us with eclipse glasses which we used during the event. The eclipse was once-in-a-lifetime, but we definitely recommend this space for any family vacation or Adirondack getaway."

We checked out some of the places my wife went to growing up like High Falls Park, High Falls Gorge, Niagra Falls, Meacham Lake, and St Regis Falls, where her grandparents used to live. My 3 boys and my niece got to experience the beauty she grew up with. We could not have asked for a more perfect stay. Thank you so much for allowing us to experience your beautiful house.

The location of Seina's place was very beautiful, and the lights on the exterior helped us find the house with ease at night. The house was spacious, the beds and couches were very comfortable, and the fully functioning, modern kitchen was great. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the AC unit. Fortunately, summer nights in the north country are relatively cold, so we opened windows and the house did not reach an uncomfortable temperature. The lack of AC bothered some of the members in our party more than others. We appreciated that Seina promptly addressed all of our questions/issues."

When we arrived, the house was lit up and there was jazz music playing. It felt so cozy and inviting.
The deck overlooking the water is a treat. We enjoyed coffee, tea, yoga and reading to the sound of the water.
The cabin is in pristine condition and has everything you could need in it (besides a stove) We loved the little fireplace, and we really appreciated the warm lighting throughout.
The property is magical. The hosts live on the property, their home is visible, but it was not even a little bit of a bother for us. They respected our privacy and only came by to help us and to help us enjoy our day better.
We were truly blown away by this place. Great centralized location to ADK park (about 25 mins to the entrance)
We LOVED It here."

The property, even at night, was very inviting! The string lights were a welcoming detail that also made it clear where the cabin was and where we could park our vehicle.
Everything was so clean! I was surprised that there weren't any bugs, even for a cabin in the woods! The sounds of the river nearby were very relaxing. It was nice to know that Victoria and her husband were nearby but the location and orientation of the cabin on the property made it feel very private.
Wonderful experience, would definitely stay here again!! Thank you!"

Stayed one night","Before I delve into my glowing review, I need to ask one question: May we please live here? Seriously, this place is nice enough to never leave! The cabin was absolutely perfect. My one regret is that we only stayed one night. It was close to attractions we were visiting for the day -- next time (yes, there will be a next time!) we just have to find more to do. The cabin was super easy to find, and check-in/check-out were simple. It's a place of my dreams. The cabin was bigger than I expected, yet so cozy. The bed was super comfortable, too. I wish it didn't rain or we would have spent the entire time sitting next to the river. Otherwise, great weather -- cool enough for windows in the summer (though there was an a/c if needed). I'd love to see this place in winter and enjoy the wood stove! It was close to the owner's home but felt quite secluded. We would return in a heartbeat. A+ cabin. Highly recommended!"

Answered our questions almost immediately and had a very helpful welcome page. Hotels can never compared to the comfort and personal touches of this adorable cabin. Where else can you find a cabin near a beautiful river with A/C, wifi and all the privacy you need. We will definitely be back!"

Trout river was right in front of the cabin, with a little spot with chairs to look out at. The cabin came with a sheet of paper with recommendations for near by restaurants, attractions and information about the cabin, which were very helpful in picking a spot for a birthday dinner. Thank you Victoria!"

After a terrible experience with another owner, we were ready to say goodbye to Airbnb.. but Victoria's cabin and hospitality definitely showed us that there are owners that genuinely care. The cabin is still like new! Super clean place and a really comfy bed. 😍 The windows are screened, so it was nice to have them open to listen to the river and let the fresh air in. The river is just a few steps away, too! Everything was perfect! We will definitely book this cabin, again. 😄"

You truly get everything you need inside the accommodation, from heating blankets to some wine. Definitely considering booking it again some time in the future!"

The wine they gave for our weekend was amazing, and the littlest things that go the extra mile meant so much. The bed was quite honestly one of the comfiest we’ve ever slept in (my husband found it online and wants to buy it now😂), and Victoria had the heat on before we got there so we came at night to a super cozy and warm cabin. Highly recommend walking around the property and checking out the Trout River, and Riverside restaurant was such a nice date spot! We will be recommending to our family who need a nice break, and will try to venture back to this cabin. 🥰"

All new or nearly new construction and furnishings. From the mattresses and pillows, to the lighting, the bedside charging stations, the appliances- it’s all like new and tastefully done! There is a small café within walking distance where we had some delicious meals.

The place was even bigger than I expected from the pictures! It is also located in a very cute area. There are plenty of stores around so if you need anything last minute it is not hard to find! It was a bit of a drive to certain places in the Adirondacks, however the drive was beautiful so I didn’t mind. Also, for the reasonable price of the place I didn’t mind spending a little bit of extra gas money to get to where I wanted to go. If you don’t want to drive far, there are still things to do in that area! My stay was amazing and if you’re considering staying here, you definitely should."

* Spotlessly clean
* Easiest self check in ever
* Amazing hosts! If we had a question, we texted and Juan got back to us within minutes!
* Beautifully decorated
* Had everything we needed.
(Next time I can pack much lesss)
* Close to Canadian border, so if you were in the front of the house and looked towards the back, you will see the most amazing sunsets.
* Perfect Location. Close enough to town to get there quickly for whatever we needed, but far enough away from town that there wasn’t a lot of traffic and the nights were quiet. We enjoyed sitting outside to star watch.
* Most of all, Can’t wait to visit again"

It's so cozy and peaceful and sits right on the Little Salmon River, which offered some fun weekend fishing. Location was perfect for day tripping into the ADK Park.We cooked in and had everything we needed to make great meals. Beds were super comfortable, plenty of room to spread out, even our two schnauzers were relaxed, which was different. We had perfect weather and would build a fire outside for cocktail hour...then move inside and build a fire in the wood stove which warmed the whole cottage. Lorraine prepared some homemade soup for our arrival which was wonderful. They are super nice people and let us know anything we needed, all we had to do was ask. Check in was super easy and communication was so easy. If you are looking for a stress free getaway, this is the place. We look forward to doing a repeat visit in the future."

They made sure that we had everything we needed and were very helpful throughout our stay. It felt like we were visiting with family ! The setting is gorgeous, it was a real pleasure to sip my morning coffee while taking in all this beauty and listening to the river. There is lots to do around for nature lovers, such as hiking, swimming, and of course, fishing.
Thank you for sharing your little paradise with us Lorraine and John, we can't wait to come again!

We were welcomed by a delicious veggie platter and fresh flowers from their lovely garden which we got to tour shortly after we arrived. The cottage itself is exactly as described and I can still hear the river’s song echoing in my ears. Watching our 10 year old son learn to fish on the same river his Dad fished on at that age is a priceless memory we will all treasure. He didn’t even ask to turn on the TV until the last night of our trip and then it was to watch a show about… FISHING! The hosts were also great with local recommendations and even made a tee time for us at the golf course! We look forward to visiting Riverside cottage again!

Stayed a few nights","This was one of the most beautiful locations we’ve ever stayed at in the northeastern US. The Salmon River is right behind the cottage and the landscaping and gardens of the property compliment it perfectly. The cottage was very comfortable and rustic, and the wood burner kept us warm even during a night that dropped below freezing. We had a great morning of fishing nearby and landed a decent number of good sized rainbow trout. John was away during our stay but Lorraine was an exceptionally hospitable hostess – she made us feel as if we were visiting a relative. The leek and potato soup she had waiting for us at arrival was excellent, she made sure we had everything we needed, and we very much enjoyed watching the Baltimore Orioles and hummingbirds while touring her gardens. We visit the Adirondack region every year and we very much look forward to staying there again."

The cabin itself is spacious and well stocked with appliances and utensils. Heating the place on cold nights was easy with the small wood oven in the living room. Parking was not a problem. The well water was absolutely delicious and left no residue. Both hosts were very friendly and accommodating and knew the area well. This was a fabulous find and I'm glad I booked when I did.

We were delighted by the gardens on the property, and all of the spaces to enjoy time outside whether it was the fire pit, the screen tent, or the chairs by the river. The setting feels a bit enchanted. My daughter loved wandering around the gardens on this property, as well as John and Lorraine's beautiful garden next door, and playing in the river. We were looking forward to peace and quiet and that is what we got. The sounds of the river were so peaceful and we also enjoyed watching the birds and butterflies from the windows while we ate our meals. The interior of the cottage is very cozy. The surrounding area is nice and the house is close to restaurants and grocery stores. John and Lorraine are wonderful hosts and very communicative throughout the process and went above and beyond to troubleshoot an internet issue we had during our stay. We were greeted with a delicious veggie tray and dip which we had with our dinner our first night. We cooked most of our meals and found the kitchen to be well stocked with pots/pans/utensils as well as pantry basics, and appliances. We recommend visiting the nearby Wilder Homestead if you are fans of the Little House on the Prairie books, and having a meal and ice cream at Bokies.
The only real downside for us was the bed. We knew the rooms came with two twins and a double and while we rarely book anything with a bed smaller than a queen (we have a king bed at home), we felt like everything else about the property made up for the small bed. Ultimately though my husband and I, neither of whom are particularly small, opted to sleep in the twin beds so we could each have enough space to sleep without disturbing each other. We both toss and turn a lot. My husband is 6'1"" and found the beds to be just barely long enough for him. Again, we knew exactly what we booked, so the beds were not a surprise and this is about our preference, and is not a ding on the hosts or the listing. The beds are comfortable, just a bit too small for us. If you're extra cuddly sleepers though, this is the place for you! :)
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and recommend this lovely spot to anyone looking for a comfortable place to relax."

They showed my boys their bees, and helped us start our fire for s'mores, and were very friendly and kind. They even called around to restaurants to ensure a place that was allergy friendly for my kids! We are already planning our next visit!"

Inside the home is very cozy. They had an appetizer for us upon arrival and spent a few minutes chatting which made us feel like we were visiting friends. We also got to see them check on their honey bees. A very cool experience. In short, I would recommend staying at this home :)"

Stayed a few nights",Riverside Cottage was a perfect place for me to use as a base for some volunteer work on the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas. I had everything I needed. Reliable wifi and well-appointed kitchen allowed me to spend a lot of time in the field and do some record keeping and research when needed. A comfortable mattress for my touchy back can be an issue in an new place and this one was great. Lorraine and John have created a very bird friendly location. 90 species of birds recorded in four days in mid-May within a 12 mile radius of the Cottage speaks for itself. Enjoyed conversations and learning about bee-keeping as well. I booked on short notice when a window opened up for me and they responded quickly. Looking forward to returning with my spouse for a week in June. She grew up on a brook and will feel quite at home on the banks of the Little Salmon River

Lorraine and John really went above and beyond and I am happy to say we found our new vacation spot and can’t wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","As first-time AirBnB customers needing to escape the city for fresh air, peace and quiet, you couldn’t ask for better hosts or a home away from home!
John and Lorraine are seasoned travelers who know how to make fellow travelers feel at home. Upon arrival Lorraine greeted us with a seasonal vegetable plate hand-picked from her garden and homemade dip. If you have a question, they are ready with an answer. If you need something, they are there to help.
The Cottage by the River (Little Salmon River) is CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. The kitchen has just about anything you need to cook like a chef, and if grilling is your thing, the gas grill outside is ready to go. Firewood for the campfire is even free.
There isn’t anything much better than heading out the door with your early morning coffee in one hand and your fly fishing rod in the other, walking 50 feet to the river, drinking your coffee while listening to the cadence of the river, and knowing the only thing you have to decide on is: should I head up or down stream for the first cast? Spoiler. Ask John where the best fishing holes are located.
We’re already looking forward to our next stay and what Lorraine’s appetizer will be."

Stayed a few nights","This place is pure paradise, and especially so during the pandemic!!! It is absolutely beautiful, truly, and so peaceful and quiet and relaxing and private and, naturally, totally free of any kind of crowds...the property is just gorgeous, the birds were chirping, there was a breeze in the trees, and oh, that river!!! It's a little more of a babbling brook at that point, and the sound is just delightful and we had fun wading around in the water w our little dog, who was in absolute HEAVEN the ENTIRE time we were there, btw :-)...and, oh! The stars!!!
It was just SO easy to just relax and let all our cares just drift away, and we knew we were in a really safe place, covid-wise, too and that was important. The entire place was even better than we expected and just EXACTLY what we needed!!!!
As for our hosts, Lorraine and John, well...they were just amazing!!!! They were so warm and welcoming and friendly and accommodating and so lovely to talk to...they are very interesting and have interesting stories to tell. They left a welcome plate for us full of delicious veggies from their garden w some of Lorraine's yummy home made dip, and they very kindly brought us some OUTRAGEOUS muffins Lorraine had made bc we actually had some medical and traveling issues before we got there and we were late and so frazzled and they took pity on us... ;-)...AND they showed us their honey bees - so cool!!! They really are WONDERFUL people and hosts!!
The cottage was just so adorable and was furnished just exactly as a home in the country should be...somewhat eclectically w antiques and beautiful wood pieces and cozy bedrooms w comfy beds and beautiful quilts and a wood burning stove, plus everything you need to cook and eat in (instead of going out, which is always a great option, pandemic or not).
There were plenty of places to sit outside, be it by the fire or under the shade canopy or right next to the Salmon River, which runs right through Lorraine and John's property, and we fully enjoyed the sun, the shade, the river, the gorgeous surroundings, the stars...it was truly perfect seriously not an ounce of hyperbole, we promise!!! We had an idea of what we wanted in a little getaway from the city and quarantining and wearing masks all day and simply wanted beauty, peace, and quiet...and we got ALL that and even MORE!!!
Truly, we can't recommend this place, and Lorraine and John, enough - go and ENJOY!!!!
PS - Don't forget to visit the Almanzo Wilder Farm and Homestead, just a short drive away...it was FANTASTIC, and we think even people who AREN'T fans of the Little House on the Prairie books, or don't know much about Laura Ingalls Wilder, will still enjoy a tour and wandering the grounds. and for fans - what a TREAT and an absolute DELIGHT!!!! Call ahead to make sure they're open and to schedule a tour. Fun!!!! :-)"

Both Lorraine and John were wonderful, helpful, available and welcoming hosts and anyone who books with them will be in good hands. The river was a dream to sit by during sunsets and the cabin was cute, cozy, and picturesque. I believe Lorraine and John are in the process of upgrading the gazebo, so make sure to check in with them about it if it's important to you. An absolutely wonderful visit!"

Your cottage is so cozy and welcoming. We really enjoyed chatting w/ you at the fire pit, and thanks for the tips for our trip to Cape Breton next year.
The location can't be beat if you love to fish. The amazing Salmon river is right outside the back door!! Saturday we caught rainbow trout, brown trout and even our favorite, a brookie. I did go out Sat. night around midnight to try my mouse pattern but w/no luck. We also explored the Chateaugay river----jackpot!!! We will surely keep your lovely cottage in our future fishing plans!

Stayed with kids","Lorraine and John are terrific hosts and their cabin is the getaway you have been waiting for! In addition to a very comfortable home, they were extremely welcoming and even went so far as to have a pot of soup on the stove for us when we arrived fairly late in the evening. The house is cozy and warm even so late in the season, and the location is terrific, right next to the river. We highly recommend and will be coming back in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","John and Lorraine were the most CARING and THOUGHTFUL hosts we’ve ever experienced. Such a breath of fresh air to interact with personable, kind people who add personal touches to make sure you feel comfortable and well-communicated with. The cabin was simple, and the woodburning stove was a hit. It was a dreary weekend weather wise and yet this is one of my favorite trips to date. Exploring the riverside was my favorite part. Thank you for everything"

The house was just the right size for my two sisters, myself, and my mom. It was close enough to town to run into the grocery store but felt like our own little campground (with the pleasure of hot showers and a stove!).
We wished we could have stayed even longer and were sorry to pack up the car and depart."

The photos of the river barely do it justice. We ate every meal and spent all our time gazing out at the water, the herons, the anglers, the woods-- a truly unspoiled place. There is a small falls just up the road! As beautiful as the river looks, it's actually better. As wonderful the reviews of J and L, they're actually more thoughtful and kind."

Stayed with kids","Overall, we enjoyed our stay at John and Lorraine's cottage. They are both so welcoming, thoughtful, and kind! They were wonderful hosts, and the two of them, the atmosphere, and the river were the best parts of our stay. However, the cleanliness of the cottage itself could have used attention. Additionally, the cottage becomes extremely hot due to a lack of insulation. We did have some exceptionally hot weather during our trip (high 90s during the day and mid 70s at night), which exacerbated the situation. Due to the extreme heat, we had to wait until well past our young children's bedtimes for the cottage to be a comfortable temperature. John and Lorainne graciously did their best to help by providing extra fans and making a pool in the river for our children - which were very much appreciated!"

All the little things you need are there, just bring some food to grill and some s'mores for a campfire and you're all set. The wood stove kept us cozy and warm on one of the days when it was cold and rainy; made all the more cozy by our Host Lorraine's homemade batch of Gumbo!! The rainbow trout we caught that evening as the sun came out for sunset made a perfect memory!!! We hated to leave. Can't wait to go back!!"

They brought us things to help get the fireplace in the house started, there were fresh flowers on the table and hot soup on the stove when we arrived. They made sure we made it there safe and told us they were worried when we arrived a little later then expected. They came over and introduced themselves right away and gave us tips about the surrounding area. Told us if there was anything that we needed just to ask, although they had already done more than enough when we got there. The cottage is located right next to the river and it was great to wake up to and eat breakfast ! Would highly recommend and would stay here again !"

There's even a short walk down the street to a small trail along the road that takes you to a low waterfall in the river. Just a beautiful location.

Every morning and evening I caught Brown Trout fly fishing on the river right in front of the cabin. Our seven year old son was grinning ear to ear when he caught his first fish, a nice Brown Trout on his fly rod in the same area.

We also visited the Wilder Homestead (Farmer Boy from the Little House series) and loved it.

The cottage is so cozy and comfortable and it was cool enough for a few of the days to enjoy a fire in the wood stove. The setting could not be more perfect. The river in this area is beautiful and enhanced by the beautiful gardens and flowers all around the property. There is also an outdoor fire pit and grill, along with a screened in sitting area. We loved sitting by the fire at night, watching and listening to the river.
We really enjoyed fishing and caught a delicious brown trout for lunch one day. The cottage is set up great for cooking and has everything you could need.

Stayed a few nights","Overall, my time away at the Riverside Cottage was a wonderful experience. The setting is absolutely lovely with the nature filled trout stream mere feet from the back door and a consistent peaceful quiet that's hard to beat. The owners are also quite affable and I can't say too many nice things about them. As a matter of course they offered to help or provide me with anything that I might have needed or forgotten for my vacation. I'm sure they would have happily sat and socialized with me for hours as well if I was of the mind to want to do just that.

For the literal cottage itself, for the total price it is hard to beat. A completely applianced kitchen, a full bathroom, a living room, two bedrooms and three beds, all for less than a typical hotel room. The location of the cottage is great too with a number of places worth visiting within driving range for the day, and the nearby town has all of the basics one could need as well.

All in all I will happily suggest this rental to anyone looking to get away for a time; it's not an exquisite resort, but it is most definitely a fantastic home away from home."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Lorraine's and John's River side Cottage was a great experience!
The cottage is right beside the Salmon River and offers a lot of privacy.
Inside the cottage is everything you need, full equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, nice shower, lots of space in the living room.
There is also lots of information about places were you can go and visit, and about shops and restaurants etc.
Just a few minutes walk from the cottage, there is a small and beautiful waterfall where you can go for a swim.

Lorraine and John are very friendly hosts who will tell you what there is to see and do in the aria. (We enjoyed Highfalls Park, this is about 20 minutes drive from the cottage).
We were invited to there beautiful garden to have a glass of wine with them, enjoying the wood fire and nice conversation!

We highly recommend this place!
Thank you again Lorraine and John, we had a very nice and relaxing time!"

The cottage is so sweet, the pictures do not exaggerate its charm, and the high ceilings make it feel very spacious. The river and surrounding land is absolutely gorgeous, with just a short walk to a beautiful swimming hole on a flat rock with small falls...perfect for exploring. Lorraine and John were ideal hosts, friendly and informative and encouraging us to enjoy the area. We would definitely come back!!!"

When we arrived they were on site to answer any questions and made our stay perfect. The cabin was exceptionally clean, and exactly as described. The kitchen had everthing we needed and the bathroom exceeded our expectations for a cabin rental. There was an outdoor gas grill and seating area that made this spot worth every penny. My husband and I along with my mother were all impressed with this stay. I am already trying to make plans for a ladies weekend again in the fall!!"

Stayed with kids","Great stay, was large and very quiet, great layout. I would say that a little ‘welcome’ flag on the drive way or something to look for may be nice, a bit unsure upon arrival if was the place (there are multiple units). But is a remote area. GPS found it fine. We were up for the eclipse and had a lovely time, was great to head back for a nice meal and relax. Good beds, top sheets and extra kitchen towels, nice to have dishwasher and washer/dryer, all kitchen things you’d need! I would absolutely stay again if in the area!"

Solid cell service and internet. We were in the area for an Ironman, and the space allowed us to store the bike downstairs and have it be out of the way. The roads around the home were perfect for biking and running without having to worry about traffic. Within driving distance of several towns and activities, and a grocery store was conveniently located. Michelle pro-actively provided all of the check-in/check-out info and rules and we didn't feel worried about any unknown expectations. The scenery was beautiful and it was a very peaceful experience overall. Absolutely recommend, and was one of our best AirBnb experiences."

Michelle is a very accommodating host and answered all our questions before and during our stay immediately. It was about 35 minutes away but that also meant away from the crowds that come with there being 4 colleges in the area. The pictures don't do it justice. The rooms are large and there was more than enough space for all of us. We had dinner at the apartment and had all the supplies we needed. I should also add that it was almost 90 degrees on graduation day and it was wonderful to come back to the cool temperature of the apartment. We will definitely book again should we need to.

Stayed a few nights","This is a spacious, inviting, very comfortable space - great for a family or group. The living room is perfect for hanging out, with ample and comfy couches; the kitchen is big and fully equipped - you can really live here for your stay. Two bathrooms are a plus and the jacuzzi tub a great extra. I found the location a bit out of the way, but the place is a great deal and so worth having to drive."

Stayed a few nights","Review
We spent a long weekend at this great location. The apartment is gorgeous and large. While it was just my husband and I, it would be fabulous for a family or even extended family. We enjoyed preparing several meals in the nicely appointed kitchen. After a day of exploring waterfalls, trails and other sights, we enjoyed putting our feet up in the comfortable living room to watch tv or use the excellent WiFi to update family and friends with the day’s activities. We used the North Bangor/Malone location as a jumping off point for multiple day trips exploring upper the Lake Champlain area, the Saint Lawrence River and various locations in the Adirondack Park. As an added perk in these times difficult times, the apartment was super clean. I felt very safe."

Stayed about a week","I had a wonderful stay. The space was clean and spacious and I loved the convenience of having a washer and dryer, dishwasher, and a master bathroom with a shower and hot tub. There were plenty of towels and extra bedding, and nice touches like coffee and tea. I would definitely stay again! I came here to hike the Adirondack high peaks. While most of the hikes were 1 hour and 30 mins away, I enjoyed the drive down gorgeous route 30 and 86. I opted to drive a little further to my hikes and the trade-off was well worth it-- three rooms, a kitchen, living room and two full bathrooms. At the end of a long hike, I would take a nice hot bath, relax on the comfy couch or snuggle under the covers of my bed. It was perfect!"

The open living room, dining room and kitchen allow for the group to gather comfortably. The bedroom sizes are perfect and laundry room is big plus! The location is excellent, just 4 mins away from Walmart and 8-10 mins away from Malone. Perfect for family seeking peace and quiet."

Went on a few other hikes near by. Michelle is accommodating and will follow up with any questions you have. This place is close to Canada. If Canada borders weren’t closed, I would have drove up for a few hikes."

Stayed over a week","The main bedroom is wonderful with a plush mattress, roku tv, your own bathroom with soaker tub and shower, walk-in closet, and blinds that block out 95% of light. We appreciated the icemaker, and the super quiet dishwasher. The view from the windows was pretty and we saw more than one rainbow. All 3 beds had great mattresses and there is also a sofa bed. Kitchen had coffee, teas, some staple items, and many spices. Host is quick to reply to questions and helpful."

Stayed a few nights","We had such a wonderful time staying in Michelle's home. We came up 4 adults and 2 teens (family members) to visit my daughter at SUNY Potsdam for family weekend. We where a little bummed that the B&B was 40 minutes away from campus and figured we would just spend most of the weekend on campus and would come back just to sleep , but everyone loved the place so much that we didn't want to leave. Instead cooked really big dinners and had my daughter and her friends dined every night of our stay at the house. The place was so spacious, clean and the prvt bathroom in the master bedroom was a major surprise. When they came for dinner my daughter and her friends fought over the lounger chair in the living room it was so comfy ! The kitchen and dinning room is huge, clean and fully equipped. I am a bit of germaphobe , but as soon as i saw the kitchen i had no qualms about cooking in it. Michelle was very nice and quick to respond. I would love to stay again even with the drive to campus. It really felt like staying at home , We loved it ! (other pluses: Wash and dryer that we where free to use, lots of clean towels and linen , great hosts)"

The decor is stylish and very comfortable. We are a family of four and never felt crowded. The location was only a few minutes from Malone. Michelle was prompt in her responses and went beyond our expectations. The house had plenty of extra linens and every kitchen tool we needed. Can’t wait to stay again!"

Group trip","What a lovely space! My husband, mother, son and daughter-in-law were visiting for a wedding in Malone. This condo was very close and so spacious for all of us. The furniture was very stylish and comfortable. All 3 bedrooms were roomy and the beds were super comfortable-even my insomniac mother slept well! The bathrooms had all of the amenities you would expect at a hotel, the kitchen and laundry had new appliances, detergent and pantry staples and coffee. Those are often things one needs to buy (which is inconvenient as you never need as much as you have to buy).
Communication with Michelle was easy and she was very helpful. The property description warns of the fact that there are stairs. My mother (81 years old) was pretty slow on them but it was fine. I would definitely stay here again!"

Definitely lots of room in the common areas and sleeping quarters. Expect an 5-8 minute drive to town, which didn't bother us at all and we found Michelle's place was well-equipped. It appeared to be an updated and modern living space. Loved our visit there while we travelled to the Adirondack mountains."

Group trip","Great location in upstate New York. We were 2 adults and 3 large teenage boys in the Malone area for a baseball tournament. Big, quiet, very clean, and well appointed space. Kitchen is awesome and well equipped. Master bedroom is spacious with a whirlpool tub in the ensuite as well as a shower! Other bedrooms are a good size and the beds are really comfy - and great pillows! (a pet peeve of my recent Airbnb experiences). Kitchen, Living, and Dining areas are large and very comfortable. Michelle was very quick to respond to a couple of minor questions. Easy check-in and check-out. I cannot give a big enough recommendation for this space - it was a fabulous, relaxing place to stay!"

The open floor plan of the living, dining and kitchen area makes for a great social area and the windows let in lots of bright light. The beds are all super comfortable and the rental has the amenities you need for an enjoyable stay: extra towels and linens, a kitchen stocked with ample dishware, glasses, pans, etc., and a dedicated laundry room. Communication with Michelle and Juan was excellent and I would highly recommend their apartment!"

Stayed a few nights",Everything was as though it were new. Very convenient for me while working as a volunteer for the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas III. Short drives to blocks that I was responsible for and everything I needed to enter results on line--dependable wifi etc. Cordial and helpful hosts. Though in the middle of town it was quite quiet. I did not respond to your questions about restaurants etc--that is not an interest of mine. I liked being able to do my own meals at my own convenience while doing this work. I was able to make some significant additions to the Atlas.

Stayed a few nights","This place is immaculate. This is an island of tranquility and order in a sea of unattended, over-promised, absentia-managed rentals. The owner has clear, simple requests that help ensure the continuation of exceptional sterile neatness and simplicity. This would be the first foray in my lengthy bnb history that did not involve a plethora of used, overflowing kitchen utensils. It would also be the first occurrence where I didn't feel compelled to wipe everything down with clorox wipes and strip the bed of it's sheets. The owners live next door and are respectful of personal space and privacy. However, if you avoid engaging in conversation with the owners, that negligence will be a missed opportunity to meet two of the most memorable people that will ever cross your path. In actuality, I would rather remain reticent since I'll be working in the area for awhile and this review is like revealing your secret fishing spot. This is that diamond in the rough."

We look forward to staying here again!"
