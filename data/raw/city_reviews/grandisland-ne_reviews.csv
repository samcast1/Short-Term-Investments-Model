Stayed one night",Stayed for a chill hang out with my best friends as a mom getaway. This place was perfect for the 3 of us. The backyard was amazing (hot tub was a favorite of ours) and it was a peaceful place to relax but close enough to run into Grand Island for things!! The hosts are the nicest people (brought us the best cinnamon rolls for breakfast) and their dogs are so friendly and cute!! We definitely enjoyed our stay and talked about coming back!! Thank you so much for the perfect spot for our weekend getaway!!

Stayed with a pet",Craig and Kimberly were so incredibly nice! We had our bridal party getting ready there and they were so accommodating. When we didn’t “check in on time” (wedding planning was crazy busy) they had messaged us just to make sure that everything was okay and see if we needed any help with anything. The area was so beautiful for the backyard and their fur baby was so nice and sweet. I would definitely stay here again! We took a lot of our getting ready photos in the suite and in the backyard and it was a beautiful and quiet place! I cannot recommend it enough!!

The yard had not been cleaned before we arrived, there was piles of dog poop all over the yard, and after we left they wanted me to pay $90 for service animals after they said they’d cover the fee as the dogs are service animals. I thought that was very unprofessional. We were there for a total of 7hrs and left no mess."

Breakfast of waffles, mandarins, peanut butter, and syrup was delivered to the door. Was greeted in the am by Abbi the brown pup. Had to give her a little love before heading on our way. The option of hottub and pool (for summertime) is an amazing bonus. Wasnt able to take time for it this trip but do have plans brewing in my mind to take the kids. 150% recommend!"

Stayed with a pet",Place was beautiful and clean! Originally I had booked this specific place because the pool was said to be open which is why I wanted to be there. It wasn’t open and they were working on it but wasn’t up for use while staying. There was a wave of ants coming into the place but once I asked for pest control supplies they were very accommodating and got it taken care of quickly! Overall the stay good!

Stayed a few nights","Craig & Kimberly's oasis was a fantastic and somewhat unexpected experience. It is on the very edge of Grand Island, which makes it peaceful and restful, but close enough to the services of Grand Island to provide for all your needs. The studio setting is spacious and very comfortable. I stayed right as Spring was about to start, so I could not take advantage of the in-ground swimming pool, but I look forward to a return stay during warmer weather so I can enjoy the spacious back yard with the pool and the hot tub. I was also traveling alone and for business, so swimming wasn't really on my agenda. But I do foresee a return with my family sometime soon. I usually would not consider Grand Island a vacation spot, but in all seriousness, I think my family would love a couple of nights of relaxation so close to home since the experience would feel so far away. I would recommend Craig & Kimberly's oasis to everyone."

The weather was COLD and it was so nice to come back to a warm little oasis with the fireplace going. I met Craig and he was very nice, explained everything very well and then did not linger. It was complete silence while I was there. Perfect. I will be back. The pictures show exactly what your getting; a very nice, clean and affordable place to call home for a short spell."

Stayed with a pet","My first impression was joy when I saw this place as it is nice and clean. However, the joy stopped there for me. I needed a place to stop through that would offer R&R from a long distance drive in cold weather. I also wanted to do laundry. Craig informed me that they could do my laundry. I was expecting a washer & dryer to do my own for which I would have to pay but he said that the w & d flooded so it was removed. Kimberly msged me that laundry ready and I would be charged separately at $15/load. I wish that C&K could have communicated this to me before I gave them my laundry. Also, there is no privacy between the guest entrance and the backyard which is shared by the family and their dogs. The dogs go out freely. All I did was open my door to walk my dog and one of their two dogs, Abbi, lunged toward my dog. I had to physically separate Abbi from my dog. I picked my dog up. I was relieved she was ok. I noticed Abbi sniffing at the guest door entrance while staying there too."

Parking in the driveway was convenient, and the back yard was lush and I was invited to use the pool and hot tub, and though I didn't take advantage, they looked super clean. The neighborhood felt safe and family oriented. You can tell that a lot of care has been put into this place."

Stayed one night","Our stay at Craig & Kimberly’s place was great. Upon arrival, Craig greeted us and showed us to our space. It appeared to be recently updated and felt clean and inviting. This is one of the rare instances where the actual space looked better than the pictures in the listing- new kitchenette with a sink and mini fridge, updated bathroom with bigger shower and built-in fireplace/TV. Not to mention the back yard was gorgeous.
Craig also offered us some recommendations for food nearby which was great after being on the road all day and unfamiliar with Grand Island. In the morning we were treated to warm scones and fresh fruit. The attentiveness of Craig and Kimberly and the quality of their space was outstanding, especially given the very reasonable rate. The only disappointment was that the hot tub was not working- which was a big draw for us. We would definitely stay again if traveling along i80- we even tried to book it again for our return trip but unsurprisingly it was already booked."

The yard was great for the dog and we had a blast spending the chilly evening in the heated pool and hot tub. Craig and Kimberly are great hosts and even provided breakfast for us before we left!

Stayed one night","The photos & description online are great, but every single thing about Craig & Kimberly's place is so much better in person. The comfortable cottage is so clean, so spacious and full of thoughtful touches. The yard is just jaw-dropping amazing. We arrived late (and our gracious hosts were wonderful), and had a long drive the next day which meant we did not have nearly long enough to enjoy this beautiful place. Next cross-country road trip we we have to book early and plan to have more time here. Can't say enough good things about this lovely AirBnB and the awesome, responsive hosts!"

I had to leave early and my friend was there alone and thought some one had broken in. Noises coming from the basement made him really nervous. Come to find out it does state on more info that the housekeeper lives in the basement. Long story short it freaked him out! Just know if you stay here this could happen. Would have been nice to receive a text that there could be some one that comes and goes during the day and night. I

It was Memorial Day so obviously people will be out and about, but during the evening we heard loud bangs and yelling. We looked out to see people fighting and chasing each other out the street. It may have been a one-off situation, but a bit unsettling."

The bedroom situation worked out very well and the number of beds worked out perfect. The only thing I would suggest is a larger dining table and more seating in the living room for the amount of people this house can accommodate. It did however work well for us, and we would definitely recommend this to others needing to rent for a larger family gathering."

We all fall in love and definitely will stay again if we have to. One of my friends forgot his passport and we returned to pick it up and the host contacted me after 3 hours to know if we got it!! That is thoughtful and nice, excellent host. Thank you for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for the 4H national shooting sports competition and wanted a place where the family could be together. Suong's place was absolutely perfect for us. We were 3.5 miles from the fairgrounds and only 15 minutes to the range.
The place was immaculate and easy to find. We had some maintenance issues like the AC not working but Suong was VERY responsive and had a person out there to repair the system the very next day!
The only downside was that we were there the weekend before July 4 and the neighbors loved to light fireworks well after 10 pm. That was a bit tough to get some sleep with rockets going off but we could see that the neighborhood in regular times would be very quiet.
We absolutely enjoyed the place and assuming the kids make the national qualification next year we will be returning. We loved the place."

This was the exact half way point between my friend who lives in Iowa and myself that lives in Colorado to meet. Decided to just see what Grand Island had to offer. Was VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!
The rental apartment was a perfect place to stay and walk to restaurants and boutiques!The only thing I would have liked…an iron and ironing board, and notice of the steps (as I shattered my ankle and was still healing)…BUT their attention to welcoming us with snacks and the sweetest card ever…made us feel so special.
People are INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL in Grand Island!!! We met so many wonderful people! Great antiques, great restaurants, fun speakeasy, sculptures, art…even played some pickle ball, and found a geo cache.
Who would’ve thought this little town had SO MUCH to offer and everyone had so much pride in where they are living…our hearts are filled.
Thanks Grand Island! We’ll be back!"

Would have been helpful to have a 'booklet' with any specifics on the house (day to put out trash, what's expected of guests prior to checkout, etc). Prompt to respond when I had questions. Very understanding when one of the kids mistakenly grabbed a pillow, but were luckily still in the area to return. Price for a 2 bedroom was a bit higher than what we have paid in other parts of the country. Still much more comfortable than a hotel, ever!"

The basement ""suite"" is great if you have early risers and sleepy heads like we did. We took a walk around the neighborhood one morning and it was very nice. Minutes from I-80, restaurants and shopping. We would be happy to stay here again if we are in the area. Thanks Sam!"

I did an extended stay and originally booked less time but decided to stay longer and he worked with me to accomodate my longer stay. I really enjoyed my stay there and it was a nice home away from home while I was in the process of moving. I would highly recommend this place. It is a quite nice neighborhood and yet still quick drive to almost anywhere you need to go in Grand Island.

Lawn care and snow removal was alway timely taken care of and Sam was very good about letting me know when someone would be there to do any maintenance. Sam was very respectful of my space and time if he needed to have any house or lawn care. Overall Sam was a great host and I would highly recommend this airbnb house and host. Hope all of you enjoy your time there as much as I did =)

I immediately felt safe upon arrival! The home was VERY clean and free of clutter! She left snacks out /coffee/ and drinks in the refrigerator! When I walked in the bathroom smelled like bleach which means it was thoroughly sanitized prior to my arrival! There is on property parking which is a big plus since I hate parking my vehicle on the street! The large fenced back yard was perfect for my pup to run around!! Definitely 10/10 would stay again!!

Very nice deck on second floor with chairs and a fire pit, for great views of the wildlife all around... not just sandhill cranes, but turkey and all sorts of prairie birds. The drive to town is 5 or 10 minutes away, so convenient to stock up on supplies. Hosts were very helpful and quick to respond with the few things we needed or had questions about. Two thumbs up, top marks all across the board!"

This home is well stocked and had the most generous amount of towels, bedding and things like napkins, cling wrap, baggies, tupperware, we reallly felt at home. We had lovely weather so we enjoyed time in both the front and backyards. We also spent time in each of the two living spaces (main and basement), both were very comfortable. We came for the Cranes and the location of Doris's cottage was a perfect distance from it all and a cozy landing spot at the end of the day. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Grand Island, thanks Doris!"

It was so nice during the August summer heat that the air conditioning was on and the house cooled for our arrival. Every detail in the home - linen, towels, décor, bathroom supplies, books, dishes - are provided with guests in mind. It was so inspiring to see how a smart remodel makes a small historic home feel large inside. The kitchen has a full fridge, stove/oven, microwave, and a sleek compact dishwasher. The basement living area with laundry and second bath is a bonus space to hang out. If you are tall, just be sure to duck your head at the front door or going downstairs!"

Group trip","Our family was in Grand Island for a funeral and we wanted somewhere that we could stay together and hang out in between. The house was exactly what we needed. There were SIX bedrooms with plenty of linens. Lots of space to spread out and a family room in the basement where the kids (teenagers) all loved hanging out. It is in a very safe and new residential neighborhood and the kids were able to walk to a park and nearby grade school to play on the playground. Cassondra was very responsive. We could not find an iron in the house and I messaged her and although they were out of town, she sent one right over. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend and stay again if we are ever in the area! Thank you!"

In addition, we had a person in our group who caused an issue and Casondra was very understanding about it. The property is great; brand new and very comfortable for large groups. We would stay here again anytime."

They are gracious, helpful and go out of their way to be sure their guests are taken care of and comfortable! As for the property itself, it was beautiful! There was plenty of space for all of us to enjoy one another or have privacy if needed. The setup made it possible for early to bed sleepers to rest without being disturbed by the card playing night owls. The beds were super comfortable, large furniture in the common spaces provided plenty of space for everyone to gather and the kitchen was well-equipped and exceeded our needs. The kids loved the video games the most, they are all saving for one of their own. We visit Grand Island at least once a year and hope to stay here again in the future. It was perfect!"

I usually look for places with bathtubs for an epsom soak after long hours on the road and while this tub wasn’t super deep, it was standard sized and just fine for a nice long soak. Although I bring and use my own bag of epsom salt when traveling (iykyk), it was a nice touch that the bathroom was stocked with a small bag of its own!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at this precious home while being in town for the Jr. Nationals, so we were only 1.5 miles from the barn! Michaela and Linda have truly thought of every single detail you might possibly need while being away from home. Some highlights and take-aways for me:
I loved (and truly appreciated) having plenty of towels/wash cloths/linens! The beds were comfy. The neighborhood was beautiful, peaceful, and so quaint. We were able to easily cook every single night while staying there! There are lots of different games inside the coffee table that we all enjoyed. My kids enjoyed playing the piano each day. The house shares a driveway with the south neighbor but they really kept to themselves. There isn't a back yard, more like a patio, so we brought a small traeger to grill on (as we were there for almost a week) and were able to visit with some of our dear friends that we only see once or twice a year.
This house was more than perfect for us! We will stay here again!"

This was 3 years ago and we have booked it for this event each year since. And we plan to continue booking it as long as we come to Grand Island. We have been that impressed, not only with the house itself, but Michaela's attention to everything being right.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone staying in Grand Island. It is a two bedroom, one bath , so that might be an issue for a larger group. But there is only two of us using the house so it works perfect for our needs."

The location of your Airbnb was perfect for our needs. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, discovering local gems, and experiencing the vibrant atmosphere.
One aspect that stood out was the exceptional level of communication and support you provided. Your quick responses to our questions and your local recommendations were invaluable and enriched our itinerary, ensuring we made the most of our time in the area.
The welcome basket with local treats and the personalized recommendations tailored to our interests demonstrated your thoughtfulness as a host. These small gestures made our stay memorable.
Wishing you continued success and happiness in your hosting journey.
Warm regards,

For two people, it is perfect. It may get a bit crowded with more people staying there due to just one bathroom. But it isn't a deal breaker. There is a washer and dryer in the basement. Wi-Fi is excellent.
The location is in a quiet neighborhood and only a couple of blocks from the grocery store. Also, use Gas Buddy to find cheaper fuel. Like most places, the price can very up to 30 cents a gallon."

Stayed a few nights","This is a very nice looking house in a very nice neighborhood. Even the lawn looked perfect. It was recently completely remodeled inside and was done very well. Everything looked new.
Pretty much all you would need to stay here other than food is provided. And there is a small table in the kitchen with a basket of breakfast bars, oatmeal, coffees and hot cocoa.
The AC can freeze you out inside if you choose, even though it was around 90 outside while we were here. The WiFi worked great and was sufficiently fast for streaming, games, or Netflix.
The beds have pillow top mattresses and were amazing to sleep on. And the bathroom has a heated floor if you are staying during the cooler months.
There is a washer/dryer in the basement if you need to do laundry while staying.
We will definitely stay here again if we need a place in Grand Island."

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for a month for work by myself and of course its a bit too big for myself (not that its a problem). I believe One family could stay here with ease. The communication was smooth even though it was late notice, which I am thankful, they were able to approve me right away. I stayed during the winter when there was a snow storm and they were nice to hire someone who could plow the snow off as I couldnt do it cause of work. You can adjust the heating of course and as to what everyone says, the bathroom floor is heated! I always stay in the bathroom a bit longer than usual just cause of this and the design is just warm and cozy in there. Of course we are in the middle of a pandemic and cleanliness is important. This place was very clean when I got there and tried to keep it as that even after I left, sanitizers and cleaning materials are readily available and extra things that you did not ask for but need. The basement is where they have the laundry and dryer that you could use and it is very easy to learn. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and you get to have a parking space just make sure you park at the right one. Also, I love how the doors have passcode so you dont have to carry a key around to get in. Trash collection is every tuesday morning unless it changes. They have an antique piano that I loved very much and I miss it already. Overall, I felt safe, warm and cozy staying here, definitely would book again. Thank you so much for letting me stay. :)"

WiFi and a kitchen with a keurig and extra pods and creamer made my short stay heavenly. I didn’t realize there was no dishwasher (I booked in a hurry so that is on me!) but there are soaps and things to wash with so you’re covered. I sadly had to check out early but it was a lovely stay and Michaela was so super flexible when dealing with me and my crazy work schedule. I so very much appreciated it!! With any luck I’ll get to come back again sometime soon.

Stayed with kids","We were passing through Nebraska on our way to Colorado and need a place to stay. This was more than just a place to stay. It was very clean, plenty of room for our family of 5 and located about 10 minutes off the interstate. Located in a family friendly neighborhood, we were able to take a walk that night and stretch our legs. Good communication from owner and was offered early check-in if needed (we were not going to be getting there early, but the offer was nice). Grateful for a peaceful, quite, comfortable place to stay after a day of travel."

It’s located close to shopping and restaurants, but also on a quiet street. We loved having an attached garage too… so nice for loading and unloading the car in the cold.
Ashley was accommodating when we requested a late check out. Which we very much appreciated.
We highly recommend this property to others."
