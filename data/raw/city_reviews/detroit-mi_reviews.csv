Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely place in a quiet neighborhood; I loved all of the art!
Don't let the bed fool you; when we got there, we thought the bed looked like a futon I used to sleep on in college, but the mattress turned out to be amazingly comfortable - maybe better than my own bed.
Google had a hard time directing us to the place, but Clarence was on the phone with me less than a minute after I contacted him, and he got us to the front door right away.
We'd stay here again the next time we visit Detroit."

Stayed one night","We had a great one-night stay at Clarence’s to explore mid-town Detroit. The place was small but cozy and we really appreciated being able to do some laundry and walk to a bunch of great local businesses. Don’t expect it to be completely quiet as the unit is on the first floor, but we felt safe and enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Clarence is a very responsive host, and very willing to accommodate. ￼ I asked for an early check-in, because my flight arrived earlier than the 3 PM typical check-in time, and he was very amenable to this. ￼ the apartment was furnished with everything that I needed, for my five – day stay! ￼ when I had questions, he responded in a timely manner. He even offered to come and check something out, when I couldn’t figure out one of the appliances. ￼ I would most certainly stay here again. ￼"

We made our way from there to the Fillmore, making stops on the way and it was a great walk, only about a mile total. The building was newer and modern, the apartment had everything we needed. There was a delicious pastry kindly left for us by Clarence the host who was also a great communicator. Would definitely stay here again."

1. If you are attending a concert you only have to cross the street to get there and back.
2. If you are not attending an event, there is easy in and out access through the garage if you want avoid the traffic from events.
There are board games and complementary snacks! Just an overall great place to stay. :-)"

I have stayed in a few different places/locations over the years for various trips to Detroit and this was by far my favorite to date. Perfect spot to catch a Red Wings game - the townhouse is literally across the street from the arena. Sam was friendly, responsive and provided quick communication for everything that we needed as things came up and we needed assistance. They were also flexible with our check in and as accommodating as possible. Can’t recommend this place enough. Book this for your next stay and you will not be disappointed!"

Stayed one night","Hands-down the absolute best stay in Detroit! It's literally across the street from Little Caesars Arena, talking 500 feet to the entrance. The Q line metro trolly is directly outside, and generally runs the entire city for free. I cannot say enough about the host, super accommodating, fantastic, communication, and all around just a great guy. I've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs and this is the best host I've ever had. The space is immaculate and the added things like family board games and pre-logged in Netflix was a delightful treat. The bedrooms are huge, 75 to 85 inch TV in each one. Master bedroom has a Jacuzzi and a Zero G bed. Second bedroom has a balcony attached to it. Neighborhood is safe and quiet, this really is a diamond and Detroit. You will not be disappointed with your stay."

Stayed one night","This place was everything we expected and more. Much much more. We three ladies took a trip to Detroit to enjoy the arts, and it did not disappoint. There was some concern among our group about safety in the evening and safety of our accommodations. Those worries were put to rest immediately. We all three felt safe. We all three felt like it was Home. This place had everything we could think about, and many things that we didn’t even consider. Host was responsive. Every time we asked about restaurants, suggestions and availability of transportation. The Q line is right there!! in fact, we could have stayed another night and taken the Q line directly to the DIA and other museums that we visited. Perfect location. Perfect house. Hundred percent are going to use this locale again because we didn’t even scratch the surface of all the Detroit has to offer. Five stars definitely recommend!!"

Stayed one night","Very clean and comfortable AirBnB! The attached garage was SO great to have for the cold Detroit weather. It is very narrow but doable.
There is a long set of stairs going up from the garage. We didn’t have much luggage so it wasn’t too big of a deal but making multiple trips would be a solid cardio workout.
The townhouse looked just like the photos. Very clean! The kitchen was well stocked, including water in the fridge, tea & coffee, and snacks.
Both beds were very comfortable! Soft linens and towels. Cosmetically, the downstairs bathroom is a bit more dated than the other rooms but still nice and clean. The TVs in the living room and bedrooms are HUGE! There are also a keyboard and lots of boardgames in the living room.
Excellent location. Very easy to get an Uber. If there was a major event at Little Caesars arena, I would imagine traffic could get intense. We only encountered Disney on Ice crowds and it wasn’t bad.
I would stay again and recommend to friends!"

I've also never had faster communication from a host.

We went to a concert at the Fillmore theater, and we easily walked down the street to it, and also picked up pizza that was delicious.

The open living/dining/kitchen area with the fireplace and huge TV is perfect to keep everyone entertained together. Everything we needed was provided and carefully thought out. Our stay was so perefect, that we even thought about extending our trip another day or two. We will definitely look to book this place again in the future.

Stayed one night","This place was amazing. Last year we stayed in a Hotel to go to the Leafs/Redwings game, we should have stayed at this place, it's literally across the street, couldn't be more convenient. The place was spotless, they thought of everything, right down to some snacks and even epsom salts for the bathtub. The TVs in the living room and each bedroom were absolutely enormous, definitely the most incredible TVs I've ever seen. Host was great, amazing communication, super friendly, very helpful. Check-in couldn't be simpler. The place even had a garage, it was a tight squeeze, but I managed to fit my Ford F-150 in for the night (make sure you know what you're doing before trying that though, so you don't damage the house or your vehicle). The garage was long enough to fit two small cars inside.
We had a great time, comfy beds, lots of room, and lots to do down there. Definitely recommend checking out his place if you stay in Detroit."

After a bad experience with another host, I had extreme doubt and almost cancelled my stay completely. I decided against that & I’m SO GLAD I did! I had THE MOST peaceful & relaxing time in this home. It’s very close to Downtown. Minutes away from things to do & good food! It was QUIET. You would think you were the only one in the neighborhood, that’s how serene it was. The place was easy to find & PRISTINE CLEAN. It had INCREDIBLE amenities & DID I MENTION THE BATH & SHOWER?! DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT THIS WHOLE PLACE! You will end up using it EVERY DAY during your trip. The Smart TV had A LOT of options which was refreshing. I have ZERO complaints. The host was very friendly, helpful, and responsive. I’m SERIOUSLY considering booking it again for next year. BOOK THIS PLACE ASAP!!! I almost wish I would’ve stayed longer, I miss it already!"

The area is slightly North of Corktown which is a great area with fun restaurants and bars. The area is transitioning with some empty/vacant lots and run down homes but seems to be getting built up. We took Uber for the most part and was only a 5-10 min trip to get downtown.

The instruction to get to the house is easy to follow and their communication was always timely and responsive.

Stayed one night","Our stay was great. The property was cute, cozy, and clean. Instructions were easy to follow. Would book again.
A tip for those among you that may not think things through. The deck entrance is a sliding glass door - it has a security bar that must be raised in order to slide the door open. My advice would be not to raise it, rather, place it elsewhere while using the deck … lest you close the door behind you, allowing the security bar to fall into place, and you find yourself locked out of the apartment with no way to enter the property or get down to the ground floor … short of flying. You then may or may not have to phone a friend to come and rescue you. Just my 2 cents."

Stayed one night","My BF & I booked a 1 night stay at this AirBnb and enjoyed our experience. Christa and David’s instructions were very clear and helpful for both check-in and checking-out progress. The location was easy to find and very accessible to downtown Detroit! Due to a home Pistons game, there were no open spaces to parallel park on the street when we arrived so having the gated parking spot behind the building was very helpful! This space was super cool, clean, and very nicely decorated. It was stocked with everything you could want during travel-they really thought of everything!
A few comments: Although the loft was very private feeling, there happened to be multiple children whom must’ve been staying under us that were extremely loud right at 7AM. It sounded like a literal “heard of elephants” -obviously not the hosts’ fault, the noise just traveled. Also, the bed loft is not for everyone - keep in mind you must be able to climb the ladder and it’s a tight fit up there but was ok for us!"

Certainly true that you need to be able to do a steep ladder for the bed. There were four of us so we did use the pull out couch and, like any pull out couch, glad we only needed to sleep on it for a night. Sheets were super nice!
The private deck attached was super cool with a beautiful view of the skyline.

We loved having drinks and listening to music on the rooftop. The view of the city at night was amazing. The bed was comfy, shower water was hot, and the games were a nice bonus while watching Netflix. We loved the extra snacks that were given as a gift. The quick walk to LCA was very safe and so cute- all the new construction and redone historic houses are fun to look at. Overall we had the best night out at a uniquely beautiful place. Thank you for letting us stay at your beautiful home. Can’t wait to visit again."

Stayed one night","This is such a beautiful place to stay. I was in love with this house/loft and wished my trip was a little longer! The ladder to the bed is very steep and wouldn’t recommend this Airbnb to anyone that isn’t sure footed or is easily scared of heights. The private rooftop area is truly the icing on the cake. The area felt extremely safe and I very regularly saw security paroling. If I’m ever in Detroit again, I’ll definitely be back!"

We went to a Tigers game, which was easily walkable from their home, and in what seems like a reasonably safe area. There are several nearby restaurants and we ended the evening with wine on the balcony and a wonderful view of the skyline! The only thing I would note is that the bed was not very comfortable for me, but I know that’s such a personal preference thing."

They are such friendly, accommodating hosts, and their home is absolutely stunning. It's walkable to absolutely everything downtown, and going to and from feels perfectly safe. Fantastic view from the rooftop deck - especially at night! We got back from a show at Comerica and sat up there with a nightcap to watch the lights, which was a really cool way to finish off the evening. Won't want to stay anywhere else any time we come to Detroit!"

We drove a short 10 minutes to both the middle of downtown for brunch and also a brewery along the river. Even walking home from dinner/stadiums, we felt perfectly safe. The ladder to the loft is quite steep, so something guests should consider. We loved the private rooftop patio and ended each night gazing over the skyline from the cozy adirondack chairs. Everything was as described, super clean, and well appointed. Highly recommend!"

I took my laptop and did a working lunch at Bodega on the corner and then Grey Ghost for dinner (highly recommend making a reservation since they get very busy). It was the perfect little getaway. Beautiful area to walk around; peaceful and felt very safe. The loft was spotless and felt just like home. Christa and Dave are amazing hosts. Can't wait to go back!!

Clean, spacious, beautiful. Loved the little Detroit touches. Host was very responsive to any questions and everything we needed was there (loved the shower and shampoo/conditioner amenities!). The ladder is steep to get up to the loft, and I was initially concerned, but it is very safe and secure and I didn’t have any issues getting up and down. I’m 5”5 and I could stand up in the loft, but just barely, so if you’re tall, just keep in mind that the roof is low up there. Felt safe parking my car in the private lot and we did see security driving around often. Totally an easy walk to restaurants and the arena. So happy to have stayed here! Would definitely come back."

We stay in Airbnbs all the time and sometimes they can miss the mark, but Christa and David's is exactly the type of gem that keeps us coming back.
Communication was super prompt and everything was so straight forward and easy. Finding the place, parking, and checking in were all a breeze. Everything was clean and functional. The whole place was tastefully furnished and decorated. It was really the perfect combination of looking nice while still being very comfortable.
It was so convenient to have gated parking and be able to walk to the Tigers game at Comerica Park. They also provided local treats like chips and soda. They just really put a lot of thought and care into the place that I really appreciated.
The ladder to the bed in the loft is quite steep, but the bed is large and comfortable. My fiance and I didn't have any issues at all.
10/10 would recommend and would stay again!"

My only note for future travelers is that the stairs to the loft are not stairs but a ladder - like climbing into a bunk bed. The loft ceiling is quite low- as you see in the photos - but I didn’t quite realize how low until there. I am 5’7” and could touch the ceiling sitting on the bed. It’s not a room you can stand up fully in. If you like cozy places, the loft bed is for you!"

The sofabed mattress was very thin. The loft bed wasn't very comfortable & less headspace up there than expected. The stairs leading up to the loft is completely vertical which could be dangerous/uneasy for some, it was like climbing a ladder."

We walked one block to dinner. The only thing that was a little tricky was the ladder and loft area. The ladder is a bit steep, and the headroom is low. It's my first time in a loft so nothing to compare to. Definitely would stay again."

Stayed one night","This was my first air bnb experience and I’m so glad it was here! Came for a concert at the Little Caesars Arena and wanted a place nearby, and this place is in walkable distance of the arena. Checking in was easy peasy; parking was in a gated space in the back of the home. We were greeted with a classic Faygo rock and rye, which was delicious and apparently really hard to find. The living room had a nice stereo receiver which packed a lot of sound! The rooftop terrace was a real plus! It came with remote controlled lights that came with preset colors which was awesome. And the bed in the loft was amazingly soft. I wished we could’ve stayed another night but this place was booked - and for good reason! If you’re looking for a real cozy and nice Airbnb with great hosts and nearby the arena (or park) definitely book a night (or more) here!"

Walking distance to a great vegan restaurant, coffee shops, etc. Christa was responsive to our questions and we felt welcome, cared for and safe. The place is spacious, well decorated and you can tell a lot of thought went into creating a comfortable place to stay. Both the bed in the loft and the pull out sofa bed were quite comfortable. We'd love to come back and recommend it highly."

Stayed one night","Christina & David's place is warm, cozy, and cute as a button. Honestly, the nicest AirBnB that I think I have stayed in, to date. the communicated clearly and gave detailed instructions for check-in. the spaces were very comfortable and full of character. The view from the outdoor balcony is amazing!
We were also very pleased to find quality whole bean coffee, grinder, and french press provided. We are big coffee drinkers and fresh pressed coffee is an important part of our mornings, so it was great to be able to have that since it's not economically viable to pack your own coffee, press, kettle, etc when traveling.
The bed was very comfortable and the loft was a pleasant space. The furnace is quite loud when it kicks on, but it did not wake us. The location is close proximity to a lot of restaurants and bars, although we got in quite late so many were closed, bit I would imagine that this would be a great location to easily access many good sights, sounds, and tastes.
5 stars, we will probably return to this AirBnB in the future."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment building itself was very nice. The apartment was lacking amenities (only given one full towel and one bath tiny one for two people), there was no coffee maker or supplies as described, there was an iron but no ironing board, and worse of all the bathroom was a bit dirty. There were bright pink hairs in the shower. Finally, we were not given a building fab so we had to use the back freight elevator and had to knock on the glass door and have the receptionist open the main door for us at night (we asked about this and were not given one still).
To be fair, the host reached out and asked if there were any issues to resolve, and I of course could have said something, so that is my own fault! But only being there for 36 hours, I did not want to have to deal with any people. So take that for what it’s worth.
Finally, there rules are pretty strict (all outlined pretty clearly), but just be aware of an excessive steps to take (like taking a photo of the tv remote on checkout)"

Also, we had to get let in the building by staff at the front desk rather than, having a keyfob and a building key to access the building and parking structure. However, it was a very nice unit and building with a lot of nice amenities. Location is perfect to everything including restaurants and major sports events, and the people mover was right next door. We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to coming back again soon! Hopefully, the host will provide a building keyfob and key to access the building and the parking structure without seeking the assistance of building staff. Outside of that had a wonderful time!!"

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed this house very much because I was a beginner and they were patient with me as I called several several times unfortunately some things were not in place as they should have been when I arrived but they did get on it once I phone them. unfortunately we were not able to get the Wi-Fi working for the main TV in the living room but I could live with that because the master bedroom TV did work. some of the amenities weren't present but they did send someone to Walmart to purchase all the things that we needed so that was great. last but not least the linen did appear to not have been clean but there is a washer and dryer in the unit it just appeared that someone had not stayed in the unit for a long time and was just Dusty and a little stale, but this is coming from someone that is extremely OCD. the condo is as beautiful as listed and is in a prime location. lastly the parking was not free I ended up being billed other than that I enjoyed my stay."

There was also no coffee pot, so plan accordingly. We ate at local restaurants and found great coffee shops nearby, so it wasn’t a huge inconvenience. But wanted to mention that.

Building was a little noisy at night but nothing unexpected. Appreciated the safe, free parking. Kitchen was sparse, so it was difficult to cook there-could have used knives, spatula, cutting board, coffee filters. We ate out most meals. Overall a great place to visit!"

Stayed one night","We came down for a Red Wings game and needed a last minute place to stay. The building was amazing. Got a little rowdy in the evening but we were staying downtown for that vibe and Matt Rife was in town so the college girl gangs were out all over the city lol
Loved the view, loved the vibe, bummed we didn’t have time to go check out more amenities. We already decided to book again this summer to get the full experience in better weather!
My only negative feedback is that it was hard to figure out how to leave and we weren’t the only air bnb guest in the building confused how to navigate without our key fob. I don’t really blame the host, the building just needs better signage."

Front desk staff was also very friendly & helpful. We loved having a place to stay so close to everything for the night & with all the security measures (gated parking, key fob required entry to building, ect) we felt very safe! Thanks again for a great stay!"

No wonder they won the best design for their bathroom design which was not only beautiful, but also very functional . I don’t think anybody else could have designed this loft space any better. Spacious and very comfortable with great use of color and design, also managed to feel very homely and welcoming. Took Airbnb stays to another level"

Also, and I am not just saying this, one of the best nights of sleep I have EVER had. I felt like I was sleeping not just on a cloud, but literally IN one. The sheets were SO soft and the comforter was so lightweight yet still so warm. It was perfect. Just perfect! Treats, coffee, filtered water, coolest shower/bath setup- ya can’t beat it!!

However, we wanted to be able to prepare our meals as we packed our food and though it stated pots and pans; which I don’t consider a small pot and a cookie sheet…pots and pans so hopefully that gets corrected. Overall, I would still stay again if I can afford it when the time comes. The relaxing in the large tub with a bubble bath and closeness to the event centers truly makes it worth it. It was a beautifully redone space."

Settled in a charming, up and coming neighborhood, this flat is the perfect spot for a Detroit getaway. The totally renovated space sits above a lower level, spotless garage. It is minimally, but tastefully decorated, and the modern design was done beautifully. (Especially the bathroom; take advantage of the amazing bathtub.) The carriage house feels cozy and safe, and outside noise is minimal. Short and easy walk to LCA and surrounding restaurants. The hosts were kind, responsive, and extremely respectful. I will definitely save this as a place to stay in the future.
Thank you for sharing your beautiful home."

I would think a place built like this might be chilly in December but the heat was set at more than enough, very cozy.

The inside is absolutely gorgeous—light, airy, plenty of space. The bed is extremely comfortable, and that’s hard to come by. I appreciated the different types of pillows for different sleepers. That’s not typically something many hosts consider, and it was a thoughtful touch. The alley street parking was actually quite easy and very private. The area itself is secure, friendly, and quiet.

Stayed one night",Great home in great location with amazing hosts. Big plus for me was that Whole Foods was just minutes away and the kitchen is a great size and equipped with everything you may need to cook — that made it easy for us to prepare lunch & dinner (since most everything was closed around us for the holiday). The closet and bathroom make you feel like you’re home and the bed & sheets were so comfy and clean. Only regret I have is not being able to stay longer! I truly would recommend this home to anyone in the Detroit area.

Stayed with a pet","Had a great relaxing stay at the Carriage House. The bathroom was as amazing as the pictures & the brick inside was gorgeous. For a couple, the openness of the layout was nice, but if looking to go with others, you’d need to be very comfortable with them. We walked to downtown & it was an easy walk to get morning coffee and donuts!
The only thing that wasn’t described as well were the details of the entrance. You have to go through the large garage door to go in & out of the space. After going through the garage, there is no other door into the living space - the stairs lead up & into the open space, so essentially if someone/something gets into the garage, there is no security keeping them from the apartment area. It’s in an alley, so for a single traveler or someone anxious about safety, unloading the car & going in & out could feel vulnerable.
Just a detail that would be good for that type of traveler to know, otherwise everything was great! We’ll dream about that tub & shower!😍"

Very well may stay here again if it's available the next time we come down to detroit. The place was amazing and everything was exactly as described.

The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was a dream to cook in. This is one of my favorite areas in Detroit because there's so much to do within walking distance. And, of course, as everyone else said, the bathroom is amazing. I just had to check out the bathtub and had the best bath I've ever experienced."

Stylish, comfortable decor in an open but very private, thoughtfully organized space. Speedy Wi-Fi, easy streaming TV. Furthermore, Zoe happily answered my many questions about what to expect, so I could plan and prepare as needed. Getting in was so easy, thanks to her check-in instructions. I appreciate the clarity! I definitely hope to make a second visit! Oh and you all already know about the fantastic soaking tub and rain shower bath. Better than the best hotels in town. Shhhhhh"

My only complaint- that the garage is only for electric vehicles, we ended up paying an extra $35 for safe and secure parking a mile away (the walk was really nice, though).
It is an amazing place and will return for a few more nights in the future."

We did wish the tv had a bed-facing option (we can be lazy!), but this was by no means a dealbreaker for us. The kitchen is minimally stocked, but the necessities are definitely there (this was also not an issue for us, as all we needed to do was reheat pizza). Would return in a heartbeat."

Stayed one night","Love this property! Great carriage house with modern decor & stunning bathroom design located behind a historic home in a quiet neighborhood. Parking is free in front of the garage entrance to the home down an alley. I usually don’t sleep well in hotels/Airbnbs, but the bed is actually super comfortable with good bedding & pillows, so I slept great! Location is PERFECT, very walkable to many restaurants and shopping locations, conveniently situated between downtown & midtown Detroit, where most everything is. While there, we had great food at Frita Batidos, delicious cake & coffee at For the Love of Sugar, tacos at Bakersfield, and had to stop in for giant potatoes at Potato Place - all in walking distance. We did drive to the water and do the riverwalk, that was the only time we needed to use the car during our visit. Sadly, we ran out of time to use the gorgeous free standing bathtub and will have to come back again to experience it. Can’t wait to visit again!"

The location is amazing if you are going to an event, and the fact that you can park so easily is a huge plus. I don't probably even need to mention how cool the bathroom is, but make sure to make time to enjoy the tub. (i didn't even need to bring my own bubble bath!) Highly recommend."

The home was very clean, it felt like home away from home. I’m happy ample towels and cloths were provided. The garage was perfect for our use as well. The bed and couches were really comfortable. Overall an amazing stay, and would love to come back. I just wished the checkout time was 11 instead of 10. Especially since check-in is on the later end, but they were flexible in letting us check-in a little earlier."

There are two bathrooms, plenty of space if I wanted to entertain while in town. Standing desk in case you want to work. The only issue was that the dishwasher did not clean the dishes very well (seems old), also I got a parking ticket for parking on the street my first night. Apparently the law has changed and the Host wasn’t aware of it. Also checkout time is early, 10am."

Aside from there being a hole in the wall from the indentation of the door handle, upon entering, the space was amazing and very roomy. I would most definitely book again.

Stayed a few nights","The location was very convenient to all Downtown/Midtown/Corktown activities. The unit was much larger than the pictures implied, was clean and free of clutter, and seemed well appointed. We had a very busy schedule so we didn't make much use of the space in the living areas, exterior, or kitchen. Having a private secure garage was amazing, though the keypad to open the gate to enter the driveway was fairly awkward to use and a shorter individual might struggle to reach it while still being able to see and punch in the code. The neighborhood seemed safe and was all newer residential mixed with big historical homes, with new condos being actively built. We did not walk to downtown but it was very close and we would have felt safe doing so. There was some noticeable road noise overnight (most would except in downtown) and from others staying in the building, so it would be a great touch if a portable fan or air purifier was available in the unit for white noise."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent spot, situated between Midtown and Downtown. Sadly the Tigers were on the road for our visit so I couldn't take advantage of the fact that Comerica Park is directly across a field from the house.
The secure parking is fantastic, and the house itself is beautiful. Super clean and airy space. Both bathrooms were pristine.
Check-in and check out were perfect, you get a unique lock code for your stay which is re-assuring and handy that you can show at whatever hour and just open up the house for your stay.
If you are a walker, almost everything is in range. 15 minutes from Dowtown, 15 minutes from MOCAD, 25 to DIA, and 20 minutes from Eastern Market. If you drive, obviously even quicker.
Will definitely be staying here again for my next trip to Detroit."

Whatever you are booking this space for it would be well worth it to plan time into your stay to just hang out here. Super clean and comfortable with a very responsive host. Inside you will enjoy an incredible amount of Detroit information/history and decor. Relics of memorable Detroit buildings can be found throughout and you will enjoy reading about history of the city in the many books provided for you. While you are there you also have various Motown records to enjoy listening to - along with Michigan / Detroit snacks to enjoy. If by chance you are not sure what to do or where to have dinner Sean will have plenty of good choices. We are looking forward to booking here again in the future."

We brought our toddler, so the location of his place was perfect for us to walk just a few blocks to restaurants and Little Caesar’s Arena for the game.

I appreciated Sean’s friendly responses, clear instructions on how to enter the condo and where to park, and him proactively suggesting nearby restaurants and attractions. It was also very selfless of him to provide a gift card for the coffee shop on the corner as well as alcohol, beer, and Faygo pop. My constructive feedback is out of Sean’s control but more so for awareness. I would have liked for the shower water pressure to be stronger, the shower water temperature to be hotter, and for the walls to be more sound proof. Other than that, we had an enjoyable experience."

Stayed one night","I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough! It was perfect for our weekend in Detroit to watch the Tigers! It was clean, comfortable, and so convenient. We were able to park our vehicle then walk everywhere we went. The condo was also fun because it was decorated with lots of Detroit memorabilia and loaded with Detroit made snacks and drinks. Every time we turned around we saw something new and unique. I also cannot say enough about our host, Sean! He was able to accommodate our early check, left a thoughtful card and even gifted us a gift card to the cute coffee shop across the street, explained everything perfectly, and was just so friendly in all of our communication! I’m so glad I found this gem…we will now stay here anytime we come to Detroit for a special event!"

I hate traffic, parking, etc. and this was great bc I don't have to worry about either. The Second Best Bar is across the parking lot, Grey Ghost across the street and my favorite is actually this Tequila, Taco, Taquito place that I can't think of the name offhand. Anyways, coffee shop is also great and I'm a coffee addict, searching the world for the perfect bean.
Very clean, everything you could possible need - stylish and speaks to the Heart of the D. Great job hosting to the Hosts with the Most from one host to another. - Heather & Joe"

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)
We had the pleasure of staying at this incredible townhouse in Detroit, and I cannot recommend it enough. The impeccable decor showcased Detroit's unique artifacts and history.
The attention to detail in the design was remarkable. Curated with locally sourced items that embodied the spirit of Detroit. From vintage photographs and artwork to industrial-inspired furniture, every corner exuded both charm and authenticity.
The location of the townhouse was ideal. Exploring the nearby restaurants, cafes, and shops was great and we walked to a
rock concert.
The townhouse itself was clean, well-maintained, and equipped with all the amenities for a comfortable stay. The host's thoughtfulness and prompt communication enhanced the experience. They were incredibly helpful, ensuring that our stay was nothing short of perfect."

Stayed one night","We stayed at Sean’s place for the Morgan Wallen concert and the place was TOP NOTCH and easiest the best Airbnb we have ever stayed. He had Motown records on surround sound for us to use, stocked fridge with things for us to try included in the rental price for the night along with a GC for the coffee shop right up the block for the morning we left, which was AMAZING coffee at Cafe Alto. The Airbnb was also RIGHT next door to second best bar which was such a fun atmosphere. It was walking distance to ford field which made our night much easier and more relaxed. The area was safe. Sean was extremely responsive and so helpful with getting there, getting in, and getting around the area. The place was like staying in a hotel when it came to cleanliness and details to everything.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND to everyone. I have already had friends book since our stay cause I couldn’t say enough good things.
I will and cannot wait to be back again! 😊"

Parking was a breeze with the valet and my car was well looked after. There were so many amenities available, I lost count! Food, drinks, toiletries, fine linens, upscale appliances - you name it, this place has it. It’s the perfect space for a one night stay, but I easily could have stayed there for a few days I felt so at home. The cherry on top was definitely the host for me though! Sean is the BEST! Timely communication, helpful recommendations on places around the area, and just plain making sure you have everything you need to have a nice stay. There was no detail skipped, and it showed. I will definitely be staying here again!"

Decor of this loft was top notch and highly customized to the full Detroit experience. Loved all of the nods to Shinola, Motown, the beverages - my daughter loved the Dirty Blonde beer, lol.

Stayed a few nights","64 Watson is crème de la crème when it comes to an Airbnb experience. The second we walked in we were greeted by a note and local wine, beer and booze to enjoy. Some times during our stay we opted to relax to have happy hour at home vs venturing out to one of the many bars or restaurants nearby.
The shower and bathroom had substantial hot water and plenty of toiletries if you forgot your own.
The bed was extremely comfy and the closet had tons of space to unpack and feel comfortable.
If you do not like a well lit bedroom I would make sure you bring an eye mask, as it doesn’t get super dark and night and the sun definitely shines in early. But, this is just a note for someone like myself who is sensitive, otherwise the place was perfect and wouldn’t hesitate to book again on my next venture to Detroit!"

If you are from out of town, or a local like us, and want to experience everything Detroit has to offer start with Sean's house. All the beautiful decor is locally sourced along with all the amenities he provides. The condo is brightly lit with natural light, tastefully placed hints of Detroit history all around and so close to the lively dinning right nearby.
We booked the night before a big day at Sean's, and he was super responsive and went above and beyond to take any stress away. The condo was prepped, and we didn't have anything to worry about. I highly recommend having this experience. I hope to be back for a perfect place to stay downtown.

Stayed a few nights","Best Airbnb experience ever! I rented Sean's condo for a weekend in Detroit, and the entire experience--from the communication and check-in instructions to the location and decor--was absolutely five+ star in every respect.
The condo itself is absolutely beautiful and oozes Motown chic. The furnishings are stylish, comfy, and the perfect complement for a stay in the Motor City. And even with a changeover on the day I arrived, the condo was completely spotless and fully stocked, going well beyond any stay I've had, hotel or Airbnb!
Similarly, no hotel can match the concierge service that Sean provides. Sean's tips and recommendations give you the sense that you're visiting the best spots in Detroit, some that even the locals have yet to discover!
And the condo is in an absolutely prime location. In one day I was able to visit several local coffee shops, shop at uniquely Detroit stores, eat amazing ethnic food, and take in a Pistons game, all within walking distance!"

The condo itself is polished, sophisticated, and spotless. Location is unbeatable and it really does feel like a hotel. He included some excellent touches like a handwritten card, gift card to a local coffee shop, candles, phone charger, etc. It’s really a beautiful place. I was skeptical about all the 5 star reviews because I thought, “how could it be possible that every single person rated it 5 stars??” But after our stay, I get it. Stay here!"

64 Watson has been meticulously designed, and I'm convinced the owners should leave their jobs and open a boutique hotel. My stay began a few days before the trip when the host messaged me with details on the visit and ensured I had all I needed to enjoy our time in Detroit.
When I arrived, I was blown away by the attention to detail and personal touches throughout the space. The host left a lovely handwritten note, provided a welcome gift, and the fridge was fully stocked. All the decor in the condo is inviting and makes you feel at home. Throughout the space, the owners have spared no expense in providing luxury amenities and treat for you to enjoy. It is a lovely and quiet retreat in the heart of the city. I can not say enough great things about my visit. If you're ever visiting Detroit, don't waste your time looking at other options, this is the place to book!"

There was a logistical misunderstanding when I arrived (my fault) but he handled it no trouble, no debate…he took care of it and saved me a big headache.
His place is so cool and all the small hospitality touches were curated with perfection. He thought of everything you might need during your stay. Even signature soft drinks and beverages in the fridge. It’s one thing to have a beautiful property, it’s another thing to also be the perfect host. Just book it:)!!!"

From the booking to after our departure, Sean's communication was detailed, timely, and helpful. He provides a resourceful digital guide that houses all the information you need including some Detroit history and local places to visit. The decor and other elements are customized and localized which we loved! Sean is also very generous as he provides snacks, drinks, and alcohol. He even wrote us a personalized card. The neighborhood, Brush Park, is very close to downtown and there is so much good changes coming to that area. Our only regret was we didn't have more time there to explore more. This was the best Airbnb experience we've had thus far and are already planning our next stay at this condo."

My partner surprised me with the stay and tickets to the Elton John Concert for my birthday and it really felt like we got the full Detroit experience. The location was an easy walk home from Comerica Park and I am 29 weeks pregnant. We passed Little Ceasars arena on our walk back so it would also be a great place to stay if you had plans there. Both my partner and I don't drink alcohol so the Faygo and Detoit Coffee options the hosts left for us were an added plus. They also recommended a few great spots to check out which were all fantastic!!! I highly recommend this spot and hope to be back again on the near future!"

My husband and I visited Detroit and stayed at Sean’s beautiful condo for a second time. It was as amazing as the first! Check in was easy with using a code. Sean left instructions for us and special Detroit themed gifts like snacks and beverages-better maid and faygo to be exact!
The place looked exactly like the photos and was immaculate. The towels were fresh and fluffy. The bed was the perfect firmness with lots of pillows. The ample counter space and appliances in the kitchen, the bar cart; and the seating in the living room made our stay feel like home. The condo is right next to amazing restaurants where we walked. The neighborhood was safe - we parked in the lot right next to the building. Sean was great with arranging our parking.

The condo is warmly and comfortably decorated with tastes of Detroit (there were literal ones, too!), very well maintained, and ideally located in the Brush Park district of Midtown for experiencing the city’s culture, history and renaissance.
Restaurants (highly regard Grey Ghost is across the street; make a reservation!), shops, the arts and all three major sports venues are short walks away. The Woodward Avenue Q-Line streetcar, MoGo shared bikes and various scooter brands are nearby transit options.
Communication with Sean, including during the reservation and try processes, was extremely simple. We’ll take advantage of this fantastic property again."

Not to mention- the house is gorgeous, comfortable, quiet and spotless. Tons of natural light, comfortable bed, and all the amenities you’ll need (from local brands, too!). If you’re staying in Detroit, this is the perfect place! We will be back here as soon as we can!"

Stayed about a week","My husband and I had an amazing experience staying at Sean's condo. I travel a lot, and this was by far one of the best airbnb's that I have ever stayed at.
When I was looking for a location and sent Sean a question, he responded immediately and was super helpful and patient in answering my questions and explaining the area. Parking was a concern for me, and he not only reassured me of ample parking but also contacted the owner of the lot next door to the condo to confirm pricing and availability. I booked immediately and he arranged the parking.
Upon arrival the place looked exactly like the photos - super impressive! There was a beautiful welcome display for us including a gift card to a local coffee shop, detroit themed face masks, candles and a hand written note.
We stayed for over a week, so having ample space was important. We felt at home at Sean's condo. The furniture was comfortable, the place was super clean and the modern bathroom was amazing. The building was quiet and easy to access, yet secure. We felt very safe - I even walked the neighborhood a few times.
We walked to several local dining places. Sean supplied a welcome guide that included some places for us to try - another special addition. The restaurants were amazing and we were only a few blocks away from Whole Foods. In between meals, we enjoyed the Detroit themed snacks and beverages Sean made available. The home was stocked with waters, faygo pop, better made potato chips, spirits from a local Detroit distillery, and much more. There was even a Detroit style pizza for us. The Detroit themed décor was phenomenal. The condo could be featured in home and garden - modern yet hints of traditional and contemporary styles combined.
Sean went the extra mile to make our holiday special in Detroit. Additionally, he checked in with us and was super responsive. We will definitely book again!
This is the places to stay in Detroit!!!"

Stayed one night","Sean's Airbnb is a must stay. The location is great! It's quiet, and accessible to many venues and hot spots in Detroit. My husband and I were even more wowed when we stepped foot into the Airbnb. The Airbnb was a large beautiful space that was extremely clean, with high-quality features. The attention to detail is impeccable and thoughtful. Another bonus is the valet right next door to the Airbnb. My husband and I decided that whenever we are looking to stay in Downtown Detroit, we will look to stay at Sean's place. Lastly, Sean's communication before, during, and after was in point. Thank you for being a great host!"

One of the main reasons for an AirBnB is for good sleep, so keep this in mind if you do not like EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA FIRM beds. Aside from this the place itself is super clean, cute, decorated well, and located in a artsy little neighborhood with good eats just a walk away. I just wish the bed was better, hopefully this review will help with that!"

Please be advised that this is on the third floor and the stairs are outside, so in poor weather take it slow. I didn't feel unsafe, though. The neighborhood is mostly very quiet and there are a few good places to eat and drink within walking distance. The parking on site is a little tight and the driveway entrance is on the side of the house. There seemed to be close street parking otherwise. It is about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown proper. I would definitely consider coming back here the next time I'm in Detroit!"

Not only did he recommend Pie Sci, but he had also set out some other suggestions for neighborhood spots and was so communicative and helpful when we messaged with a few questions. Checking in/out was a breeze and we felt so welcomed to the city. The apartment was beautiful and one of the best stays we've ever had anywhere.

Stayed a few nights","Becky and Michelle’s place is in a great central location in the city. The newly renovated Michigan Central Station/park and a few restaurants are within walking distance. Downtown and many other things are just a short drive away. The kitchen is spacious and well-equipped, the beds are comfy, the shower is spa-like, and there are some great common spaces downstairs and outside to sit around eating and talking."

It was located on a quiet street in the heart of Corktown which is minutes from downtown Detroit and with incredibly easy access to major freeways when we needed to reach other areas. It was Labor Day weekend with tons to do downtown and in Corktown as well. The hosts were even kind enough to let us checkin a couple hours early. Would highly recommend!"

The aesthetic of the home was beautiful. It was a minimalistic statement.
Some things that did not impress me about the stay.
It was great that there was off street parking, but the gate would not stay open unless you were holding it open. If you are traveling alone, the gate would swing closed and damage your car. The gate was also held closed by a broken bike lock cord. Very cheap looking.
They should really invest in a keyless entry. The key was difficult to turn to unlock, and actually hurt to use.
Overall, a great experience for my needs."

Many parts of Corktown are under construction, so you'll see some fences, construction equipment, and dust, but we didn't mind it. If you have a car, it is about a 5 to 15 min drive to Mexicantown, Downtown, and Midtown, respectively. So you're well situated to visit different parts of Detroit. The check-in process was straightforward, and the WiFi worked well. All and all, I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Detroit."

Stayed a few nights","The house on Marantette Street in Corktown is in a great location near many good restaurants and centrally located. Michelle and Becky have thought of everything a traveler could need, from kitchen ware to bathroom amenities. Everything was cozy and comfortable. The check-in instructions were extremely clear and easy to follow, as were the checkout instructions.
It is rather close to the sidewalk, as we learned when we got there, so if you need privacy you’ll definitely want to keep the drapes closed. The neighborhood is probably best described as “transformational,” as it’s a mix of beautiful older homes that are well-maintained, crisp contemporary new builds, remodeled/updated homes like this one, and some pretty neglected homes, as well.
We did have an issue related to unexpected construction going on right in front of the house for the duration of our stay, but Michelle & Becky took care of us and more than made up for the inconvenience.
We will definitely come back for another visit in the spring!"

DO NOT sleep on the location either! Very quietly tucked away to almost make you feel like you are at a retreat center. Yet it is exceptionally close to the pulse of the Detroit epicenter. They are exceptionally responsive and the accomodations are exceptional. Becky & Michelle.... My buddies and I are indebeted to you!

Stayed a few nights","What a great AirBnB! The location was even closer to everything in Corktown than we expected. It was only a five minute walk to Michigan Avenue and all of Corktown’s wonderful bars and restaurants. We felt safe walking there and had no issues. The neighborhood was very safe and quiet, except for some construction during the day (from Ford’s various projects in the area I presume). The home itself was exactly as appeared in photos and the listing description. Everything was impeccably clean and we appreciated the overall vibe of the place. Added bonus was the view of Michigan Central Station from the front windows. We would definitely stay here again for our next Detroit trip!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is the definition of a dichotomy! For every great thing there are weird things, quirky things, about this house. For instance- easy, private, secure parking (plus!) but no toilet paper rolls in the bathrooms (weird); on sight laundry (great!), no door to the master bathroom (letting it all hang out while doing your business is quirky); great location and easy Uber ride to downtown (amazing!); bathroom mirror is inside the cabinet (scavenger hunt- odd!); Quiet neighborhood (excellent!); Giant painting in the living room of what we could only figure out was of a dead woman in a red dress (Halloween cool, but... still creepy). The bedrooms are big, but they're in what seems to be an old attic with very angled ceilings- not so great for tall people- so expect to duck and weave as you get out of bed.
All in all, the location is the thing here. If you need great/central access to Detroit, and a kitchen and laundry, this is your spot. If you're uneasy about nonstandard stairs, bathrooms, bedrooms, or a painting of a dead woman in the living room, you'll probably want to find another spot.
This place feels like it's not yet finished, as if someone said, ""Yeah, this is good enough."" I suppose that's the review- good enough!
Next time we're in town we'll probably stay somewhere else- variety being the spice of life and all."

The natural lighting during the day was great and the aesthetic lights were perfect for a calm and vibey evening. Not to mention the whole unit was great for photos. Location was great for a quick drive to local restaurants and activities without being in the hustle and bustle of the city. Taco the cat is so cute and friendly! One thing to keep in mind are the stairs walking up to the unit (there are quite a few and a little steep). Sharing mostly because we stayed here with our 4 month old and had to be extra careful walking up and down. Would definitely recommend this space if you’re planning a visit to Detroit. :)"

I spent my wedding weekend at their home and I couldn’t imagine it anywhere else. I truly felt at home! Zac & Renee were incredibly accommodating and I would visit again any time! Thank you again.

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I had a really enjoyable stay at Zac & Renee’s. The apartment was clean and exactly like the pictures describe.
They were also very proactive and kind. When we needed an appliance fixed, Zac & Renee were very responsive, with Zac even coming over to personally address and resolve the issue.
Couple small things to note: the bedroom is a super open space but it doesn’t have a door. This wasn’t a big issue, but something I didn’t realize before. Also, the tv is located in the corner of the bedroom/study and is on the smaller side — so there really isn’t an entertainment system set up if you plan to watch tv.
Overall, we enjoyed this space (and how much sun there was in the apartment!) and would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to the D!"

We were visiting from the west coast and arrived mid to late evening and we we’re getting over the time change. I am always so concerned not to disturb others with an Airbnb suite in someone’s home. We had the place all too our selves! Zac and Renee did a fantastic job of decorating this very large space. They were so kind to work around my departure times. We would definitely stay again! Wonderful hosts!

Stayed a few nights","Length of stay: 4 nights. Reason for visit: vacation & sightseeing.
PROS: The neighborhood was incredibly quiet during the day and night, so we slept very soundly at night, and we felt safe. LOVED the king-size bed it was super comfy. Easy and quick driving distance to all of the activities and dining we had planned. Beautiful, sunny space with sufficient air conditioning for the summer heat. Taco the cat is the friendliest little angel there ever was! He brightened our mornings and greeted us when we came in for the night.
CONS: There are a lot of stairs to get into the apartment as it is the entire upstairs of a large, renovated house. This was not an issue for us in any way, just something to consider if mobility is difficult for you or anyone in your travel party. The shower was a bit small for my husband, who is 6'3"", but it was totally manageable."

They even recommended a massage therapist who came right to the house when I had inquired about a nearby spa as a way to kick off my birthday. Best massage I've ever had! Their apartment is just as described and couldn't have been in a more quiet or convenient location. I don't think it took us more than five minutes to drive anywhere we wanted to go. Plus, there was a great coffee house and pizza place within walking distance. The apt is in a historic area. Be sure to walk around to look at all of the gorgeous old homes and read about the neighborhood online. Would love to come back in a few years to see how this transitioning neighborhood progresses!"

Stayed a few nights","A beautifully decorated, spacious apartment in midtown Detroit! Plenty of space for dining in in the open floor plan living/dining area, or head out to a myriad of top notch restaurants within walking distance or a short drive. We went to dinner at Shewolf for delicious handmade pasta and Italian food , and Bakersfield for tacos and drinks. Close walk away from a perfect little coffee shop, The Roost (on Canfield), for breakfast coffee, pastries, and gourmet treats.
The house is beautiful, with plenty of space to hang out in comfort, all basics are provided for. Kitchen has necessities for anyone wanting to stay in and cook, coffee maker, coffee, toaster, blender, microwave, Brita water filter container in refrigerator all provided along with a selection of spices & cabinet accoutrements available. Bathroom has toiletries if you find you’ve forgotten something as often happens. Stacked washer and dryer in bathroom. Neighborhood is very peaceful, great for strolling and admiring the unique houses, (I admit a preference for the original structures over the brand new ones coming up) and quiet at night.
Most importantly, there is Taco the cat! We went half of our stay without seeing or hearing a peep out of him, despite randomly calling for him upon entering the foyer each time; he was probably avoiding us. Judging by the large “#whereistaco?” written on the hallway chalkboard by a previous guest, this is not unusual. Then on the second day, we heard a low, scratchy meow in response, and out of the cat door he emerged to take our measure and receive pets. Don’t stand up too quickly until he gets used to you, or he’ll bolt. He’s exceedingly charming and willing to roll over for tummy rubs, with zero hand chomps like my own cat gives. Word of warning, he tends to drool with happiness when pleased with your petting, so don’t be startled. When he’s done, he heads back inside his door. He adds to the already copious charm of a lovely place to visit and makes it feel more like home."

Stayed a few nights","Zac and Renee’s apartment lived up to the photos completely it was such a gorgeous place conveniently located near everything! They reached out when the security alarm went off to make sure we weren’t startled, although we were not home when it happened I appreciated that we were reached out to keep us informed. Response time was amazing as well when I couldn’t locate toilet paper . Only difficulty I had was locating the garbage bins outside when leaving at 4am due to the darkness between the house and the neighboring home, I hope I placed the trash in the correct garbage bins (I’m so sorry if I didn’t). But overall if you’re visiting Detroit this place is a gem! You won’t regret it."

The bed and pillows were so comfortable. We slept amazing. We played scrabble and had great conversations. The local amenities were great and so close by. We went to Takoi and Suger House. Went to MGM and Motocity Casino. We truly appreciate having such a great host. It was an amazing birthday stay-cation.

Stayed a few nights","Arguably one of the best AirBNB spots we’ve ever encountered. Lots of natural light, stylish design, excellent kitchen amenities, and open living area are among the highlights of this place! Not to mention that it’s located in a good neighborhood that allows for a community experience while being close enough to Uber downtown to Ford Field and Comerica Park. If you’re considering where to stay in Detroit, look no further. This will be our go-to stay when we come back to the Motor City! Zac and Renee are terrific hosts with top-notch communication. 5 stars all the way!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is airy and spacious and PERFECT. Hard to believe it was so much more affordable than a hotel (which, for our purposes, would've been farther anyway!) AND so much nicer. The hosts were kind enough to let us stay later to catch our late afternoon flight. Everything was just a mile or two away, and since great restaurants will deliver. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful.
If you like delicious Italian food, you MUST go to SheWolf which is just a short walk away. So divine we went twice. Also on our list was my fave Detroit spot: Two James Distillery in Corktown. It's the first licensed distillery since the Prohibition. We did a tasting tour and loved every minute.
Thank you, Zac & Renee (and Taco who we finally met just before we left)!"

Stayed a few nights","This was me and my husband's first Airbnb experience and we were beyond satisfied with our stay. We were in a perfect location to do everything that we wanted to do. Each outing was no more than 10 minutes from the Airbnb. Eastern Market was a great morning event, touring the Charles H. Wright Museum was a great afternoon event, and checking out the Cliff Bells that night was a perfect way to end our Saturday.
We would most definitely try to stay here when we are in the Detroit area again.
Oh yeah, the host were great! I truly appreciate them checking in to make sure we didn't need anything while there."

Stayed a few nights","I live in Detroit and I managed to snag this place kind of last minute (the week before) for a solo staycation. It was so nice that I barely wanted to leave once the weekend was up. The spot is biking distance to everything that I wanted to get to: the Alpha House, the BLKOUT Walls Mural festival, Yum Village, and Motor City Wine. Though I had planned to eat out, I just kept grabbing takeout and bringing it back to the apartment because it was *that* nice that I just wanted to hang out there. So much has already been noted in the previous reviews, so I'll mention that all of the light switches are labeled (ex. hallway, fans, pantry, etc). That attention to detail demonstrates that the hosts are incredibly thoughtful. My one suggestion is if you plan to nap during the day and you like it dark, bring a sleep eye mask. The bedroom curtains are sheers. This isn't a complaint, just a little info, because it's all so lovely and sun-filled!"

Stayed a few nights","Spacious space with a nice sized bedroom/workspace. We did a gal's trip and appreciated being able to retreat to our own little house vs. staying in an apartment building. The neighborhood was off the beaten path, which is what we were looking for during the 4th of July weekend. Location was close enough to walk to some spots in Midtown, neighbors were super friendly, and we never felt unsafe (though we both lived in Brooklyn for many years, so if you're coming from other areas you might feel different). When we wanted to explore a bit further, we'd get an Uber/Lyft and it was usually around $10/ride. From/to the airport was bout $30 each way. Had we been more prepared, we would've brought our helmets and rented some bikes, which would have made exploring even more fun. Hosts were communicative, space was clean, easy check-in!"

The sunlight bouncing off the wooden floor and ceiling is a wonderful sight to behold. The space is wonderfully clean and there is a very convenient supply of helpful pantry items in the kitchen if you plan on doing some cooking. If you're visiting Detroit and want a low-key place to stay, this is the spot."
