The place was very well decorated, clean, and was one of the most stocked airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. The little details and thoughtful touches make such a difference! Torrie was communicative and made everything super easy. It wasn’t the nicest time of year for outdoor activities but you can’t beat the ocean view and I even saw a bald eagle right out front over the water. We will definitely come back and stay again if we are in Ketchikan!"

Stayed with kids","Torrie's place is a very comfortable Airbnb with a lot of privacy. It has Stylish feel and beautiful touches. The bathroom is gorgeous, a little tight, updated and clean. It has a very thoughtful touch of travel toiletries. Being a traveler with my luggage not arriving in Ketchikan on my flight, having the great selection of personal toiletries was a welcomed surprised. This is something that I have not seen at Airbnb's I've stayed at in the past. Torrie also set up a small Christmas as a wonderful holiday touch, knowing my 5-year-old grandson was going to be visiting with me. I had a hard time leaving. Highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the very best Air BnB's we've stayed at in the US. Perfect central location, quiet, warm and very spacious. Kitchen is perfect for cooking. Would recommend a trip to the Alaska Fish House for salmon chowder and Halibut. Hosts helped us out massively with a late check out as our flight left in the evening. Buses in town are so useful to and from the airport-ferry terminal, there's also a good app. The Rainbird Trail is lovely too. We really appreciated the coffee, was a real highlight as was the bath. Would love to have stayed longer!"

Stayed a few nights","This place exceeded my expectations. I travel to Ketchikan often for work and have stayed at several different AirBNBs and hotels. I will definitely be looking for availability at this place for my next trip and I will also tell my co-workers.
It's off-season right now, so most shops/restaurants are closed in the immediate area. I appreciated how it was safe to walk to one of my favorite restaurants (108 Tap House), which was open.
I had an awful migraine during my last night and was very grateful for the ice and ziplock bag to make an ice pack!
The place is meticulously clean and clutter-free, with a cozy bed. I looked forward to coming ""home"" every night to relax.
My only suggestion would be to provide a luggage ""holder"" to open and unpack suitcases. I don't want to put my wet suitcase on any of the furniture and it's a bit awkward to put it on the floor. :)"

Stayed about a week",This place was nice and clean. And they had fresh coffee for me to make. The bed was comfortable and I was able to cook instead of having to eat out every night. And I was able to rent this place a little bit cheaper than what I would have paid at a hotel for a week. So if you plan to stay in Ketchikan and do some fishing this is a good place to stay so you can cook your fish and relax in front of the tv because they have a bunch of channels that you can watch.

Stayed a few nights","Positives first; great location, middle of town, close to everything. Jacob was responsive, nice and very accommodating. We had issues with the unit, and he did all he could to resolve them. When we arrived, there was rice on the floor in the kitchen, huge dust bunnies, and crumbs on the bed. It was clear the unit had not been cleaned thoroughly for our stay, and it was also clear the unit never gets really cleaned. Every door in the building has large dark stains; there are random stains on the walls, sinks and toilet. The hallway had a funky smell. My gf was disgusted and did not want to stay. When I messaged Jacob he was apologetic and tried to help, but eventually, he let us shorten our stay which I know is a big deal so I am grateful. I am writing this review so Jacob and Cheyenne don't have to deal with this situation again. It can be a good value for the right travelers, for those comfortable staying in a more rustic place, this unit can work."

Stayed a few nights","Jake and Cheyenne are tremendous hosts! Polite, friendly, communicative and live very active lives...just ask them!
The place is in perhaps the best location in town, right in front where all the cruise lines stop because that's where the shops are and the best little walks in town.
The room has all the amenities that one needs to call it home for a few days or more.
And as they disclosed on the listing that there's a bar one level below and to the side, it wasn't rowdy at all.
All in all I would definitely come back to this newly remodelled apartment, and especially to hear how Jake and Cheyenne's adventures are going!
Highly recommend."

Location is everything while on vacation and this spot is perfect! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted, and even decided to take the local public transportation (which is right outside your door step). Everything about our stay was great, and just as described. We saw a bunch of wildlife on our walks, which we didn’t expect being so centrally located in the town center…. but this is Alaska. We’d love to come back and book again next year."

My kids spent so much time exploring the forest and beach that are across the street, they never wanted to leave the Airbnb. The additional use of kayaks and a Turo rental car made this stay incredible. We are already planning our next stay!"

Mischa and Jasen were incredible hosts and have created a little piece of heaven in Ketchikan! They were more than helpful with everything, and their house had everything you'd ever need and more! We loved our relaxed evenings on the beach across the road (we even saw a whale one night), the ease of renting the car from them (especially since it didn'teven need gas!), the personal touches in the cottage, and everything in between. We felt like we left there as friends! We would 100% recommend the Sunset Cottage!"

Cozy , nicely decorated, and comfortable. Quality beds and linens . The beach area was our favorite with a fire watching the sunset. Close convenience store and a short drive to town. Worked out that they also had a rental car through Turo. That car was electric and pristine as well. Had a fast charge station on site. We comfortably fit a family of 4 in the cottage. Well stocked with everything from bath products, A/C, laundry machines, to good kitchen pans and seasonings. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook for family meals. Any needs we had Mischa was quick to respond. The location and set up of this Airbnb truly made our trip to Ketchikan amazing. We will hands down stay here again in the area."

Lots of blogs etc on bear sightings at Herring Cove. That one turned up
negative and involved a 30 min drive, along with many a tour bus. Felt like Disneyland crowds. Daily spottings were had along the Ward Lake inlet, just south of the cottage. Low tide is key."

We borrowed the kayaks and saw orca in the sound. We traveled all over the island and fished, using the cabin as home base (following host's rules about letting your stinky fish stuff dry on the porch 😂)
Hosts were absolutely delightful and kind. Enjoyed talking to them and am grateful for their thoughtful stocking of the cabin. Tech was great and there were charging stations, roku TV and excellent wifi.
Thank you for a five star experience at reasonable prices. I hope next time we return you are available. This cabin is a huge part of what made my honeymoon unforgettable. Thank you!"

My coworker and I stayed longer term for work and all the little touches made our stay very comfortable. Very clean, and and view is spectacular. The things I appreciated most were the blackout curtains in the bedroom and the comfortable couch and mattress. Dena was not on site due to a family emergency, and that did cause a few details to go unchecked like the trash, but I can say with confidence that is not normal and that she is a communicative and excellent host."

Stayed a few nights","Dena's apartment was spacious and spotless.
There are two bedrooms, one with a double and twin bed and one with a double bed. The bed I used had worn out sheets, mattress and pillows.
Lighting was abysmal in the apartment. The lamp on one side of my bed had no bulb and even if it had one, the lamp was too short to use for reading. The bedrooms could use blackout curtains.
There is a huge picture window that looks out on the water. Also, there is a huge TV. Unfortunately, there is no comfortable place to sit in the family room. The furniture was a collection of rejects from wherever, none of them at all comfortable.
There was coffee and absolutely nothing else. I've never stayed in an AirBnB that had nothing for breakfast. Nothing.
The most difficult thing was the transportation situation.
If you don't have a car, your in for a $25 taxi ride to town, one way, or a mile or so walk to the bus stop. Very very expensive and inconvenient."

The house had absolutely everything we needed, was extremely comfortable and homey. Dena was available with suggestions of places to eat and trust me, every meal was impressive. It rained and was grey almost the entire visit but we somewhat expected that. Ketchikan was great and Dena helped us make our visit perfect.

Explored the rocks at low tide for colorful starfish, sea urchins, crabs and etc. BEST LOCATION ON THE ISLAND!! You won’t go wrong making this your home away from home.
Dena’s hospitality was exceptional and CHARLIE was the icing on the cake - as my daughter said. He waited for her on the deck to come out and play. We were greeted with beautiful fresh flower bouquets (from her garden) and a delicious treat (salmon dip) in the fridge. Her sea side vacation rental has everything you need to cook at home, very comfortable beds and a washer and dryer. We hope to return some day soon!!"

Very clean and the huge picture window looks out to the ocean. The fresh cut flowers from the garden was a nice touch."

She provided delicious Ravens Brew coffee which we enjoyed while gazing out the window each morning watching the birds and boats pass by. The laundry set up was ideal so we could wash our clothes after being very active each day - salmon fishing, zip lining, kayaking and hiking. We had a fantastic time!!"

Stayed one night",Our stay was nothing short of amazing! The combination of a great place to stay and wonderful hosts made our short stay in Ketchikan perfect. The apartment was super clean and had all of the amenities we needed and more. The beds were high-end memory foam and the bedding was incredibly comfortable. The location of our apartment in proximity of the bars and restaurants was perfect with everything we needed in short walking distance. The creek running right outside our door made for a beautiful view and we even had a Bald Eagle perched right on our balcony in the morning overlooking the creek. I can’t recommend staying with these hosts enough!

You can see the seals eating dinner from the balcony ❤️. Priscilla asked in her check out email if I’d share any complaints w her directly instead of in the comments so it doesn’t hurt her rating - and while I get it, people leave bad reviews about things she could easily fix - I’ve never had an owner ask that and it felt a little shady."

I love these themed rooms. absolutely amazing decor, and the little extra things like the pour over coffee in the first room we really really enjoyed that and the tea kettle along with the basket of munchies we didn't touch them, but really loved the thought quality shampoos, soaps, sponges, etc. It all really make a difference. I have to say the mustache ice cube and the dapper room loved it so super fun and cute. Under counter lighting is a nice, classy touch! Beautiful we designed kitchen is super classy. with walking distance to everything in ketchikan, truly a unique place to stay!"

Stayed one night","Priscilla's place was LITERALLY a port in the storm. We needed a night's stay because our flight to Metlakatla was canceled. After checking with previous hosts, we stumbled upon Priscilla's apartment and were so happy for it. The 2nd of 2 Air B-n-B's we stayed in Ketchikan, it was equally awesome!!! Priscilla was such a gracious host on short notice, had the place immaculate, provided a beautiful basket of goodies, cold bottled water in the fridge, a full coffee bar, and an amazingly appointed kitchen! The 2 of us had so much room, but this apt would easily accommodate 4 adults. This lovely apt overlooks Creek Street with such fantastic views! We had coffee this morning on the private balcony watching the seals and salmon playing in the creek! It was fantastic! Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Doug's place was FABULOUS; like being in a 5-star hotel, but you have an entire house!!! The house was impeccably clean, in a wonderful location, and so comfortable it felt like home! Doug thought of every little thing one might need to make your stay pleasant, and a cute little welcome bag awaited us. Anything we could possibly need was there. Ketchikan Creek is just across the street, and you can follow the Salmon Walk up to the hatchery, the Totem Heritage Center, and City Park; all worth seeing. Within minutes, you can be walking Creek Street ( the Old Red Light district) and visiting all the lovely shops. Downtown is literally a 7-minute walk, and everything is there! If you are not up for a walk, hop on the free shuttle to get you from one end to the other, or grab the Green or Silver Line to take you to Totem Bight and Saxman Totem parks! (Both are amazing) The bus stop is just 5 minutes from Doug's house. So much to see, and Doug's place was the PERFECT spot to start!"

Stayed a few nights","Doug has a charming, centrally-located cottage to explore Ketchikan and the surrounding area. We chose to go car-free on our trip and the cottage location made this entirely possible.
The location is perfect — close to the Creek street boardwalk to easily get into the downtown corridor but far enough away for peaceful rest. Buses are easy walk to if you want to explore outside of the tourist core.
The cottage is also very well-stocked for any culinary needs and there were helpful guides to orient ourselves to the surrounding area. The standing shower is a bit snug if you are larger bodied, but overall the cottage worked wonderfully for us as a couple.
Doug was very friendly and helpful with clear with instructions and directions."

Stayed a few nights","Doug's place was close to downtown, very clean, had extra blankets, great washer and dryer, well maintained, and a good view.
Cons: the house isn't actually on a street. It is up on a hill where the stairs to get there has a street name. People with medical conditions should take note. Also, the house is not on a creek. If you go down the stairs and cross the street, there is a creek. This was misleading. I imagined a backyard with a creek but there is no front yard or back yard or any yard. Also, over 250 a night for 1 bedroom is way too much."

Doug was a great, thoughtful host. He was very responsive and addressed my few questions timely. For us the weather was great and we could sit on the small outside porch with our morning coffee. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely consider this Airbnb again.

Group trip","I'd love to leave 5 stars, but am leaving 4 due to maintenance. We learned that Ketchikan is short on labor and so can understand why there were so many things that needed repairs (a broken door lock, loose kitchen faucet, etc). But the number of repair items in the house was excessive in the groups opinion - a big one was the covered patio leaked badly, especially at the entry door and it would pour on everyone going in & out of the house. Likewise, the patio furniture was soaking wet and unusable most of the time, even under the patio cover.
Otherwise 5 stars. Clean, spacious, well appointed, VERY well organized, and our host was very responsive to communications. Her helper parked the van at the ferry parking lot so we could pick it up right away! The location is in a residential neighborhood, but was surprisingly peaceful and quiet even with the traffic going through, and the view of the Tongass Narrows was better than expected. Also in walking distance of many things."

The home is very well stocked with everything you may need. It is located across the street from a baseball field and there was a local tournament which was fun. House was clean and spacious. Master bedroom is very roomy with a wonderful attached bathroom with cedar planked closet. All in all a good place to stay with plenty of room for our party of 6 adults. Having a van to rent is a nice bonus.
CONS:
Front window broken and taped together. Sunroof in one of the bedrooms has a blanket covering the opening, Maybe it's broken? The front deck area needed to be cleaned and the grill is very dirty (we decided not to use it)."

Stayed with kids","The home was clean, comfortable and well-located. The windows brought in so much natural light, and a view of the water....lovely. The large kitchen was a focal point for our family, as we prepared meals from all the salmon we caught! This was a gathering of all our adult children and their spouses. This house became our home for the week we spent, and the memories will last a lifetime!"

The kitchen is the best stocked kitchen we have ever seen at an AirB&B and we have stayed in quite a few over the years. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were so spacious-it was just a great house to stay in with a large group of people. We had everything we needed and the house is in a very convenient location to easily travel to local activities. Vicki was a fantastic host and communicated quickly and easily whenever we reached out to her. We would love to stay here again sometime.

He gave special attention to the details of our booking and found we had over paid and quickly refunded us.
Michael's studio is perfect for two people with full size washer and dryer, comfortable king size mattress, quiet neighborhood, well lit entry, and portable cooking appliances stashed neatly away for easy use when and if needed.
The location allows easy access to downtown shops and restaurants. Ketchikan is small enough that someone who enjoys walking could easily access the area without the need of a car rental.
I would definitely stay here again."

Within walking** distance of most of what Ketchikan has to offer.
In a quiet, neighborhood, and feels very private, with views.
Because it is in the historic part of Ketchikan, up in the hills, with small streets, and plenty of twists and turns, you need to trust your electronic Map to get there.

The deck was a great place for birdwatching in the mornings and it was fun to watch floatplanes passing by. Indoors, the space is large, huge closets, and a giant bathroom with full-size laundry. The hotel-like kitchenette was fully adequate for our weekend stay. Everything was spotless, and they even provided luggage racks and nightlights (commonly overlooked by most hosts). We enjoyed how close to town we were, but it felt private and quiet. We did not rent a car and only used taxis from the airport and to the ferry terminal, otherwise it was very walkable. The steep stairs getting back up to the house we’re a good after dinner walk! If in Ketchikan again, we would absolutely stay there again!"

The only blip I could foresee would be the walking back after exploring all day. Very steep hills. We fortunately rented a car which we also highly recommend!!

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I had a lovely time at Michael and Julia's place. The apartment was easily spacious enough for a couple, and has a large porch which looks out over the channel and across to Gravina Island. It is centrally located so you can easily access downtown, harbors, and hiking trails like Deer Mountain and Rainbird.
Michael was a very hospitable host--he brought us extra hot chocolate for our rainy days, and on a clear night, he invited us to watch the sunset from the main porch. Michael responds to text within a few hours (at most), and he even responded after we had already checked out.
I highly recommend staying here, and would stay here again myself in the future!"

Stayed with kids","Great place to stay, like a home away from home. It has everything you would have at home. A fully functioning kitchen with an array of pots, pans, plates, cutlery etc. all new. There’s a keurig coffee machine that does pods or grounds ( they have coffee pods there ready to go ) toaster, blenders, oven, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, Everything new. The kitchen sink is very big, under it is fully stocked with garbage bags, dish washing liquid etc. There’s a washer and dryer with detergent etc.
You really need to go to the apartment before you head to the store.
The beds are very comfortable with nice new comforters.
It is located in a quite private residential area but you can walk into town in just a few minutes. There is a hill on the way home. You can drive most anywhere in Ketchikan in minutes also.
We had our two year old son with us and it was the perfect place to stay with him. We will stay here again when we return to Ketchikan."

One thing to keep in mind if you don't have a car...you pay a price for that pretty view and that price is a lot of stairs/hills to climb to get to the house. We didn't mind though; climbing them made us feel less guilty about all the food and drinks we consumed in town!
We would definitely stay again."

Last minute rental did not work out and they responded ASAP from my inquire and had the rental ready in no time flat. Weather was a issue with a ton of snow being dropped, but that did not stop them from shoveling and clearing area to park and cleaning path to walk. Made sure they were available if we had any questions at any time. Again wonderful place and very comfortable, the coffee they had for us was too notch also."

Stayed with kids","A million dollar view. Up a hill from downtown, but centrally located. Apartment is well stocked with everything you need with extra touches like essential oils and defusers. (Was great after traveling for a few days)
Beds were very comfortable. A few days I didn't want to get out from under the fluffy comforter. Perfect set up for myself, daughter and 2 grandsons. (2 queens and 2 twins.)
Mindy is a super host. Lives on the property so is available for any questions or concerns. She went above and beyond to make us comfortable. Lots of extras, like laundry soap, toilet paper, shampoo and conditioner. Most condos I've rented comes with a roll of toilet paper and you have to buy more. We had everything we needed."

The kitchen contained all that we needed to prepare a meal if we didn't want to eat out. Enjoyed the comfortable bed. It is a great place to stay if you want to experience the flavor of Ketchikan."

It’s local, delicious (fish & chips as well as burgers), and almost directly below where you’re staying."

There’s a covered outdoor area where we played cards/games and listened to the birds and the sounds of Ketchikan. The apartment was comfortable and clean and Mindy is super helpful and responsive! Bonus: the staircase at the end of the street leads you straight to downtown and Creek Steet is not far at all."

The location is central to town and going North to fish at Knudson Cove or to dinner at Salmon Falls. A full kitchen with all you need to cook full meals allowed for us to eat in most meals. The neighborhood is one of working Ketchikanians with all sorts of options to walk. Patti was a wonderful host and the value on this property worked well for us.

SUPER clean, everything you need, spacious.. with the MOST comfortable couch ever.
We stayed here for a convention and it was perfect for our group.
It was right ""up the hill"" from a lot of amenities and close to the airport/ferry.
If you are older and can't carry luggage well, this might be a long walk up a flight of stairs to get inside but let me tell you... worth it!
They even let us have a late check out due to the rain cancelling our day plans so we had a place to hang out.
This place is awesome! :)"

We were travelling as a group of six, 3 under the age of 11 and it was great to have a little extra room compared to a hotel. I do recommend renting a car however. There is a nice little park nearby but otherwise most of the sights are a short drive away."

There is a community cupboard where previous guests have left food (unopened) that can be used. Fyi: Safeway grocery store will give a savers card to you to use so you get the sale prices. Matthew helped get us a discount on our rental car. He was very responsive when we had questions and even let us check in a bit early. After traveling all day that was wonderful. Hardly saw his full time renter. Very quiet and heard no noise. Kitchen was stocked for all kinds of cooking. (Air fryer, toaster, coffee maker, pizza pan, baking dishes, oven, microwave, there was more but we did not use) Dishwasher and laundry access was great. It is nice to take clean clothes home from vacation. We had a great 3 day stay. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Quiet location, but house does have a renter at the end, which we were not aware of when booking. They are quiet and we didn’t have a problem with them, or hear them, our entire stay.
Bear Valley is close to everything, and the house is easy to find.
Comfortable couch and beds, but pillows are firm and thick, which really hurt our necks. A variety of pillows would be awesome. There's a gas fireplace that helped heat the livingroom and it provided a nice ambience. House is equiped with a lot of amenities, such as coffee pots, coffee, plates, and other cooking vessels. Having a washer and dryer is always a plus! The window coverings are blinds only, so if your sensitive to early light, you'll want to bring your eye shades! The masterbedroom gets the light from the street lamp.
Lots of room throughout the rental, and would stay again if we had 4 or more traveling.
The host is very helpful and responds quickly if you have an issue."

Stayed about a week","Clean, spacious, well-stocked with supplies, quiet. It is nice to have off-street parking. This place is a good value for the area. The place looks just like the photos. Matthew is easy to communicate with and responded to us immediately to resolve a minor problem. It was nice to be near the beautiful library and nearby rec center. We felt safe there too. (The ONLY downside is that the place lacked ""hominess"" or character.) I would stay again."

Overall great experience and we would absolutely stay there again. Great value considering you get much less for often much more money when staying at a hotel or motel. Really have nothing at all to complain about and was quite happy with everything. Definitely recommend.

Heidi’s standards for cleanliness exceed anything I’ve ever experienced in my entire life, with every possible comfort and detail considered. I was fortunate to stay for 3 weeks and wish I could have stayed even longer. While I enjoy hiking and walking and intentionally did not rent a car for my stay (a month long bus pass is only $25 bucks with a library pickup/dropoff a short walk away), it was soooo convenient to rent their Turo car for 2 days to explore and hike from the north end to the south at my leisure. While it’s aptly named Bear Crossing B&B, given the bears were just coming out of hibernation, that’s the ONLY wildlife I didn’t see on this particular trip - HA!"

It was very clean, in a great location, had an outstanding view, and was overall great. Heidi and Adam were very welcoming and helpful. They were pleasant to talk to and gave us a lot of insight into the area. They helped provide a wonderful experience in Ketchikan.
This is easily one of the best airbnbs out there .
Cannot recommend it enough!

Stayed a few nights","Thanks, Heidi and Adam……Your home is SO wonderful (down to all the little details)!! A very comprehensive house rules/information book that was incredibly helpful. We did/visited many of the things/places that were suggested in the book, so take the time to read it. The basics were covered….private room with TV and full bath, comfortable bed and pillows, great location, safe environment, and could use the living/dining/kitchen/deck spaces. And then all the extras….had body wash/shampoo/conditioner in the shower, had a special shelf in refrigerator marked off for our stuff, could use the washer/dryer with all the products supplied, had use of the kitchen including spices…..as well as an unbelievable view!! We walked a lot, but also used cabs (rather expensive) and the town buses to get around.
MUST DO……Totem Bight State Park (take the bus….can get a day pass, read the signs and learn a lot), visit the Salmon Market (get the samples, but don’t forget to take home your favorites), stroll around downtown (go early cause some shops close at 4:00), walk the Rain bird Trail (so beautiful and peaceful), visit the Ketchikan Public Library, as well as sit on the deck at the house and enjoy the view!
FAVORITE EATS……New York Cafe (fresh and yummy), Pioneer Cafe (breakfast served all day), Alaska Crepe (locally owned and family run), and Cape Fox (great views and good food).
Now…it is YOUR turn to book Heidi and Adam’s place. If we are ever back in Ketchikan, we definitely will again!"

One day that Heidi was free, she even drove us all the way to our trailhead, which was hugely helpful. The only downside was the house was a ways up the hill, which was generally fine except the day after our big hike; luckily the bus stop at the library is close by. Overall, we loved our stay here."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb is well-located (yes, up three hills, but they’re not that long and it’s not worth preventing your booking if you’re able), it has a gorgeous view from the back porch, and it’s close to many wonderful attractions and restaurants in Ketchikan. It’s clear that Heidi has put a lot of thought and energy into the house and guest room, because it’s beautifully decorated; it’s clean, tidy, and organized; and it has everything you might want or need to feel at home during your stay. The bed is super-comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet, so we slept soundly and were well-rested for each day’s explorations.
The most compelling reason you should stay here is that Heidi and Adam are some of the best hosts we’ve ever had, and we felt lucky that they were so very generous with their time, knowledge, and home while we enjoyed a few days in Ketchikan. They are a terrific (and funny!) source of information about Ketchikan and other places in Alaska, and we learned and experienced so much more than we would have been able to if we stayed elsewhere. I cannot overstate what helpful, genuine, and generous people they are, and we count them among our friends now.
I highly recommend that you stay with Heidi and Adam, and there’s no question we will return here if we’re back in Ketchikan (in fact, if they were booked, I would move flights and vacation days to ensure we stayed with them again)!"

And they make a mean cooked breakfast - what better than that :)"

I will definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in town and will be recommending this place to everyone.

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in numerous AirBnB’s since becoming a member about four years ago. Most of them were “SuperHosts” and excellent. But Adam & Heidi far-exceed all expectations for hospitality — they are the “Best of the Best”!
The Black Bear room is spacious, comfortable, and immaculate. There are too many amenities to mention, but I’ll note two luggage holders, numerous power outlets, and abundant closet space. My wife is a finicky sleeper, but rested very well on the bedding provided.
The view from the shared back porch is spectacular — high above the town to see ships and sea planes. Although a bit disappointed to not see bears, we did see deer, hummingbirds at the feeder, and bald eagles over head. But a word of caution — the spectacular view comes at the cost of a significant hill-climb from town — about 300 vertical feet, according to my gps app. We did it on foot daily, but as Adam says it’s a 10min walk down, but 40min up.
Adam and Heidi share their immaculate great-room which is spacious and comfortably furnished. Plenty of cooking and dining supplies are provided, as are continental breakfast items. Both Adam & Heidi are sociable without being intrusive and turn their guests into old friends."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a gem! Heidi and Adam were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us great tips on places to see and dine during our stay. The place is really nice and clean with a relaxed atmosphere. The furnishings and decor have a pleasant polished wood ski lodge/luxury cabin feel. The kitchen is very modern and easy to navigate. The deck was our favorite part. It’s a pretty good size and covered, and has a view that blew us away. We had a bbq and socialized with other guests out there and had a great time. There were great personal boundaries in the common areas. You could do your own thing, or chitchat, or kick back in your room for complete privacy. My husband and I airbnb quite a bit, and our stay here was top notch with no complaints."

I couldn't have asked for better and they exceeded all my expectations from the cleanliness of the place and warmness from them (seriously the place is spotless, I would be shocked to see dust anywhere let alone dirt). I wish I could have stayed with here but none the less the guys made my stay so enjoyable and were constantly going above and beyond what would be required for even the best air bnb stays.
*PSA in terms of their COVID response, Heidi was very careful with who came into the house and was extremely knowledgable about the current requirements of any patron staying, making her expectations clear before confirming my stay. During my stay there were gloves, disinfectant and masks all available and even a thermometer to ensure the safety of everyone.
In sum, I couldn't recommend this place more highly."

The living space was super orderly with attention given to even the small details of the copper color palette and place mat arrangement. But don't let that fool you! Heidi and Adam are laid back and welcoming. Heidi let me pick her brain about all things South Africa and Adam had unexpected spare time from work so he drove me to both ends of the Island. I'm a bit independent and insisted on washing extra dishes in the sink, so Heidi got out of my way and let me since that's what made me feel at home. It was raining the day I was leaving and Heidi wouldn't let me out of the house without a good-hearted lecture about calling her if the weather got worse and I needed a ride to the airport.

The view is fantastic. The whole ""check in"" process was simple. Never saw a bear at the house! The location is just above downtown so was very convenient for us. Heidi's directions from the airport were perfect. However, as Heidi warned, Google maps got a bit confused when we approached it from downtown instead of from the airport. We sorted it out very quickly. If in doubt head up hill. Her responses to a few questions were always prompt.
Highly Recommended"

The location is superb, a magnificent view of the water and the mountains. We have seen deer, and eagles, and are looking out for whales. Meanwhile enjoying the fishing boat activity, it is all very peaceful. And yet it is an easy five mile drive up to Town.
We rented a car which makes it easier to get around, especially to drive every evening to Herring Cove to join a small group of local people for black bear watching. We were rewarded on our third attempt with four fascinating and active bears. We also had a fun excursion with Ketchikan Kayak Eco-Tour and saw a pod of humpbacks up close and personal.
We can only most highly recommend a stay at Mountain Point of View, make it as long as you can, it’s the perfect base to explore Ketchikan and the island."

Stayed a few nights","This home will not disappoint. Our favorite part was the beautiful view. We saw whales, eagles and lots of fish without leaving the house. Stacey was very informative from the very beginning and was always handy if we needed her but luckily she had everything lined out so we never needed to contact her. The house is extremely clean and stocked with everything we needed. The location was awesome as not to close to town and quite. This is the perfect home for a family or couples. We will be returning next year."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Mountain Point of View was amazing!! We loved everything about it! From the moment we stepped into the apartment, we could tell it was going to be the perfect choice for our first visit to Ketchikan.
The apartment is well furnished, spacious, impeccably clean and has all the amenities anyone could need, including a great view of the water and private beach access! It’s just a few miles outside of town which was perfect for us as we wanted a quiet setting away from the cruise ship and downtown activities.
Stacy & Scott are excellent hosts! They communicated well throughout the entire process, provided great recommendations on local activities and even had a gift basket of goodies waiting for us when we checked in!
We’d highly recommend a stay at Mountain Point to anyone visiting Ketchikan. We can’t wait to go back!!"

Stayed with kids","This was our first time to Alaska. Stacy’s place was probably the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed. It was so convenient and true to the description and photos. The small beach across the street is great and I highly recommend checking it out at low tide. The place came with some great goodies as well as maps/guides which were extremely helpful for hikes, etc. The apartment is close to town but also a short drive to some great remote trails. You won’t be disappointed with your stay here. Thank you again and we will be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","Stacy's apartment in Ketchikan was perfect. It is a beautiful, private apartment with a gorgeous view. The location provided privacy with easy access to town. Stacy provided a sweet ""welcome basket,"" information on the Ketchikan and all it has to offer, and wonderful communication. The space is beautifully decorated, wonderfully clean, and just exactly what we had hoped for. We are already talking about our next trip to Ketchikan...and we will definitely be returning to stay in Stacy's beautiful apartment."

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Such a perfect place for us! This place is beautiful and fully stocked with all of the things we needed.
The beds and sheets are so comfy and the view is lovely. We saw bears out at herring cove and some deer walked by the property!
The hosts are gracious and friendly. We could not have asked for a better stay."

Stayed with kids","Stacy’s place is a must stay. The space is stylish, comfortable and impeccably clean. We could not have asked for more. The kitchen is fully stocked with high end appliances and cookware. We have stayed in a lot of Airbnbs and this was definitely the nicest one.
The beds were very comfortable and we loved the location. Stacy was easy to communicate with and very helpful. Wish we could have stayed longer! Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Four of us were in town for a wedding and we loved our stay with Scott and Stacy. Home was considered a little ""farther"" from town but only a 10-15 or so min drive into town. Hosts were very accommodating with check-in and check-out very easy and simple. Had an issue with the TV that they came up and fixed very promptly. Everything was nice and neat and easy to find / use. Apartment and view were also amazing (saw whales right out the main window)."

Stayed a few nights",Staying at the Mountain point of View (Stacy and Scott’s place) was suburb! Probably the best Airbnb experience I have had. The snack basket was so helpful as we had some extra granola bars on hikes. There’s a fantastic view from the kitchen and the pictures dont do the cute place justice. Everything was super clean and tidy! Thank you and we had a great time in Ketchikan

Stayed a few nights","The host(s) went above and beyond to create a beautiful space. Check in was super easy, communication was great, and there was a personalized welcome basket full of goodies upon arrival. Saw whales, seals, schools of fish and lots of bald eagles out the big picture windows. The sheets are incredibly soft as are the towels. Highly recommend this place!"

Stayed about a week","This place is spectacular! Stacy and Scott have excellent hospitality! There were thoughtful touches like fresh flowers, and they thought of every detail. We had all the supplies we needed - Shampoo, q-tips, puzzles, books, games, throw blankets for cool nights, dark curtains in bedrooms, USB plugs, and a fully stocked kitchen with good cookware for the gas stove (foil, baggies, corkscrew, salt & Pepper, oil, trash bags, paper towels, Tupperware for leftovers, coffee, tea, etc). The washer/dryer came in handy. They have a grill and ice chest if you want to use them. They were very accommodating with what we needed for our fishing adventures. This place is decorated so nicely with neat Alaska artwork throughout. Stacy is very responsive and helpful with whatever you might need. The keyless entry made it easy. We would absolutely stay here again!!!"
