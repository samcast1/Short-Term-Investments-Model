Stayed with a pet","Top rated for a reason. The rest of the area hosts need to step up their game. Our stay was comfy and quiet with the best beds. Even the pull out deal in the office was top notch. The fridge was clean, no 3 year old jam. The space is well thought out. Stay here if you are in the Eastern UP...and it's available."

Group trip","I spent this past weekend at a hockey showcase and the apartment I stayed in was amazing! It was so neat, clean, and spacious - I felt right at home. Plus, the location was perfect - everything I needed was within a 2-mile radius. Admittedly, we had a bit of trouble getting in at first, but it was mostly our own fault. The only minor issue was that our unit was on the bottom floor and the upstairs unit was also occupied, so we could hear some noise from upstairs. Despite that, I would still give my overall experience a perfect 10 out of 10!"

This popped up at a great rate for our stay (we checked in on Christmas Eve). We had one minor snafu where we were locked out, but Edmund was immediately responsive and fixed the issue in less than 5 minutes. If this location is available, we will definitely be back for future visits."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great weekend at Edmund’s place. The king size bed was very comfortable, linens were nice and everything was very clean. We didn’t do any cooking, but the kitchen was well equipped, including a dishwasher. This place would work great for two couples, or a family, since there are two bedrooms plus a separate office/futon room. The neighborhood is quiet and only a short drive to downtown, the locks or LSSU. We will definitely plan to stay there again."

House is older but well cared for and nicely updated - it is prettier even than the photos! Neighborhood is quiet and easy to navigate. We were able to do a lot of different stuff in the Upper Peninsula while we stayed here.

The neighborhood felt very safe and there was reserved parking behind the house. The house was very comfortable and the kitchen was stocked well. I slept like a rock every night we were there, the bed was so comfortable. It got a bit warm at times but there were box fans that cooled things down pretty quickly. We will definitely choose this house next time we're in the area."

Group trip",We had a wonderful stay at Avery-Rose’s home. Our family loved the open spaces for gathering and eating. All the bedrooms are upstairs with only one bathroom (ensuite) on that floor. If any guests that aren’t in the master bedroom have mobility issues climbing up and down the stairs at night can be an issue. We loved our stay! We’ll definitely be back!!

Group trip","Absolutely gorgeous house! Everything was beautiful and felt like being at home. The house backs up to a wooded area with a peaceful and relaxing setting. Beds were comfortable and the entire place was immaculately clean. Just a couple of minor items to note. There are no window coverings on the master bedroom or the bathrooms, but both face the backyard, so it was less about privacy and more about light waking you when the sun rises. Also, there were no deck chairs. It’s a beautiful setting, but could only sit on the deck steps or stand. As mentioned, these are minor issues compared to the overall high quality of the home. Would definitely stay here again."

The house itself has three levels of floors between the rooms, and the drywall was not well finished, and not as it looked in the pictures. Owners were very responsive and Georgia assured me they had an appointment with an electrician in the near future.

Stayed a few nights","Overall, cozy is a great description for Connie's place! In addition to the coziness, the kitchen is extremely well-stocked with cooking implements, coffee maker, etc. One of the reasons we choose Airbnb's is for their kitchens and the ability to cook meals. Connie's place has everything we needed to use - the oven, the stove top, big refrigerator.
The bathroom sink area is snug but the shower stall is a nice size - and the place has lots and lots of really hot water with excellent water pressure! There is a step up into the bathroom so if you're like us you'll trip once. Plenty of room for two people to spread out and take advantage of the provided wifi and Roku television setup.
Only drawbacks we noted were due to winter more so than the property. Parking access gets crowded by the snow banks; the metal roof has a tendency to release built-up snow right onto the walkway to the unit."

I had a question the first morning and received an instant response, and she checked later that day to make sure everything was OK. We could not have asked for a nicer stay. The apartment is also located very near Portage Street which is where the locks are, as well as many gift shops. If you’re hungry and looking for a great place to eat the Wicked Sister restaurant is right next door, and had excellent food and service!

Stayed a few nights","Connie’s apartment is very well done and well equipped. We didn’t do any cooking, but it would be easy since there is a good variety of dishes, glassware, pans etc. There is a grocery store a couple blocks away and she has provided information on local restaurants. Everything was spotless, the bed was comfortable and the linens were nice. The location is central to everything you would want to do in the Soo. We were there for homecoming/alumni events at LSSU so we were only about two minutes away. There are stairs to reach the unit, so if that is an issue for you, it won’t be a good fit. We will certainly plan to stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights","Connie's place is very nice and exactly as described, only better! It's easy to find, with off-street parking and a good location. Keyless entry! Easy on and off the freeway. It's a nice walk down to the waterfront, past many interesting storefronts. You can walk to your choice of many restaurants. You're close to the area attractions.
The apartment itself was extremely comfortable and well-appointed; it has a fabulous kitchen with every implement you might need. I did not cook during my stay, but it would be really nice for a family because eating out every day and night can get expensive. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets and towels were of high quality. The bathroom has a nice showerhead and lots of hot water. Watch that small step up into the bathroom, though!
After exploring the area all day it was nice to come home to such a cozy retreat. Relax. Watch a movie. There were many small, thoughtful touches that made this stay a real winner.
I would definitely recommend staying here."

We walked down to the locks and then ate at Zorbas, exploded all the little shops, and tried a local brewery. The Cozy penthouse is only about an hour drive to mackinaw city where the ferry for Mackinac Island is located. We spent a whole day on the island so if you’re planning a trip to the island allow a whole day and be sure to ask the souvenir shop directly in front of the sheplers drop off about the bar crawl tshirt! We appreciate Connie’s place very much! Very clean and super cute :) thank you, Connie!"

The GPS Directions took us to a dead end road near the Canadian Border so not sure what was up with that. Also, bunk beds are not the best for a multi use unit. Otherwise everything worked and was a good stay. It wouldn't hurt to add some travel bottles of shampoo and soap for the shower and toilet paper that doesn't feel like sandpaper. All in all a great stay and value and we will likely return the next time we visit the area."

Stayed with kids","The vibe was: “modern, perfectly stocked, clean, organized, tiny-home, newly-built FOR the sole purpose of being an up-north glamping, rental place”
The windows in the living room were EVERYTHING. Everything seems very custom and newly built like the shower floor which has Michigan rocks cemented into it.
Kitchen and bathroom all appliances were great.
Grill + bonfire + easy access to a town 10 mins away. Hosts are responsive and friendly folk, I can tell they put a love of TLC into their home + other listings- which are all close by.
My 1 month old infant accompanied me and my partner on this birthday getaway of mine, and they were nice enough to bring out a pack n play which had a bassinet and changing table built in (huge thank you for being infant/toddler friendly)"

Group trip","Tammy and David's place was updated, clean and open. The beds and furniture were extremely comfortable. However, due to the open-floor plan and walls that didn't go all the way to the ceiling, there was little sound or light barrier throughout the entire space (e.g. if one person snores or turns on the light, it affects everyone). Also, there was no door to the bunkbed area, and the doors to the master bedroom and bathroom both had frosted glass, which did not afford the amount of privacy needed for a space designed for 7 people."

Everything we needed was provided, as well as many thoughtful touches including family games! The beds were comfortable, as were the couches, and communication was clear and prompt.
Highest recommendation for this beautiful house! It was a highlight of my family vacation."

She took the time to walk us through how everything worked, and introduced the kids to her pets (my daughter, especially, is an animal person). She even let us know that we left a charger and offered to ship it to us.
The apartment itself was immaculate. Very clean, comfortable, and well appointed. It was on a through road but in a quiet area, so a good mix of ease of access and a low traffic area.
All in all, would highly recommend staying with Kellan."

Stayed with kids","Couldn’t have asked for a better FIRST Airbnb experience for our family of 6 (kids aged 1-13). We explored the UP & needed a place to stay for a night. Kellan was responsive, welcoming, and friendly. Our kids loved how it felt like home & that they all had their own beds. I don’t remember seeing it in the listing (I might’ve just missed it) so I was surprised to see a pack n play + highchair (didn’t use them, brought our own pnp.)
We loved waking up 10 minutes from the Soo Locks. We were able to walk around before it got busy.
Would recommend the apartment as well as Kellan!"

St. Ignace was about a 45 min drive and there were some amazing beaches with dunes off of US-2 that our family enjoyed. So many fun things to do in the area. Kellan provided us with many recommendations in the area. She is such a kind and friendly host. I just can’t say enough good things about our stay! We will definitely be back. ❤️

The sauna was so nice after a long cold day. A fully stocked and working kitchen. The beds were very comfortable. I have stayed in AirBnbs all over the world and think this one will be a huge hit! It is close to M28 and downtown Sault St. Marie. Kellan is very quick to respond, you can contact her for anything. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Wow, what an amazing gem in beautiful historic downtown Sault Ste. Marie !!! The almost secret and harmoniously poetic “speakeasy” style entry nailed the vibe from the moment you arrive and walk through the Palace restaurant below’s main entry door. From there it feels even more adventurous as you open the adjacent beautiful solid wood bi-fold closet-style door with a small sign noting the ABNB access point. You will then climb a set of traditionally historic wooden stairs, which are tolerable, yet allows you enough exercise that it creates a prelude heat beat in preparation for the amazing view you find immediately upon arriving at your destination. Atop this flight you will find your entry ——— a large solid wood door with a polished brass key code style lock ——- from there, prepare yourself, as you swing this door open you are met by an amazing view over the world famous Soo locks with the backdrop of the country of Canada. An all glass wall leaves nothing to hide. I will be back !!!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved being up in this spacious apartment. Being able to watch the freighters come and go through the locks while sitting on the wide window seat was amazing, and then going downstairs and being right in town was so fun. The location really is awesome. We did just relax and watch tv in the evenings, and the sofa area is really comfortable, and then the bedrooms were lovely and private. The apartment really is up two long flights of stairs, ( in case you are doubting ) but as long as your knees are able, so worth it for the view of the sunrise, sunset, view of the locks, and location."

Stayed a few nights","Convenient location. Onsite parking OK for mid-size car. Bigger vehicles may be a problem onsite. The two flights of stairs (no elevator) will give you a workout. Short walk to everything. The window is very nice for viewing boat traffic, but not the locks because of trees in the adjacent park. Very nice park. Spacious interior. Neighborhood noise is what I expected in advance. The property is in a commercial, downtown tourist area next to a working maritime installation under construction. Occasional loud vehicles on the main drag at night. Could hear downstair tenant’s TV at night. Loud riding lawn mower on adjacent lot before 7:30 am. All 3 bedrooms had double beds. 2 of the 3 bedrooms could easily accommodate bigger beds. Bathroom clean and basic. Notified owner of 2 bath issues. A sharp protrusion on the bath’s hot water knob resulted in a minor cut. The bath’s grab bar was not secure. The owner was apologetic and quick to respond. Would stay again after bath issues repaired."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful view of the locks, spacious and clean apartment. Walk up above restaurant as advertised. It closes at ten so you will have a quiet night. We really enjoyed this space, plenty of room for sister, her kids and our father to enjoy. Working pump organ was a fun extra. Extended family and some friends came to tour the place when we told them about it and were impressed as well.
Good food at the palace saloon and easy take out. Just down the block is Birdseye outfitters, they offer great paddle tours and healthy food and smoothies, good coffee.
Note that the parking spot only works with a compact car. Close free parking nearby in a lot or paid parking at the hospital ramp. Some issues with a beeping smoke alarm which disrupted our sleep, the host eventually addressed and did make this right. Just be sure you are communicating with the main host asap if any urgent issues come up, especially in the evening.
Would stay here again when we are in the area."

Stayed a few nights","A (very well) hidden gem in downtown Sault Ste Marie!
The apartment is accessed via a closet-like folding door in the vestibule of the Palace Mexican restaurant. Up a couple of flights of stairs is a BEAUTIFUL loft-type space that is much bigger than it looks in the listing pictures. It has a cozy living room, fully stocked kitchen, spacious dining area, three bedrooms, and a large bathroom with full-size washer and dryer. Don’t forget the wall-to-wall window with a view of the river!
The location couldn’t be better. We were basically smack in the middle of downtown Sault Ste Marie, with great restaurants and museums in walking distance either direction out our front door. A short (less than a block) walk got us to the park at the locks to watch the freighters go between Lake Huron and Lake Superior.
Our only issue was with parking. Thanks to some messaging with our hosts, we found out that you do, in fact, park next to the “No Parking” sign, on top of the “No Parking” painted on the ground.
Overall, it was a great space in a perfect location that will be our first choice for our next trip to Sault Ste Marie!"

We were able to walk to all the main down town must do things: Soo Locks, Tower of History, Valley Camp Museum, Wicked Sisters Restaurant, numerous other shops and restaurants and of course the world famous Palace Mexican Restaurant and Saloon that is downstairs! Our 6 year old sons favorite part of the place was the giant picture windows from our third floor overlooking the locks allowing us to watching the ships sail by. You can track all the ships on Marine tracker online and know ahead of time what ships are in route through the locks. My family would absolutely stay here again for our next visit to down town Sault St. Maire!"

Stayed with kids","The space is the third floor of a 100-year old building, above a Mexican restaurant. You do have to be able to haul yourself, your luggage, and your children up two flights of stairs, but the space and view are so worth it. The space is thoughtfully remodeled, keeping the older charm. Lots of room to spread out and unwind. Everything was immaculately clean. Washer & dryer were great and the kitchen well-stocked and table big enough for a feast! Of course we enjoyed watching the huge boats enter and leave the docks from the window that stretches along the entire wall facing the water. Summertime's leafy trees blocked the view a bit, but still able to watch them come and go. This is also on the mainstrip, walkable to cafes, restaurants, gift shops, and the park with museum & deck to watch the locks. Highly recommend!"

The living/dining/kitchen area was a great open space, all it needs is a touch of coziness and the space will be perfect. Everything was very new and clean and we appreciated the explicit instructions for getting in. One word of caution: those two flights of stairs getting up to the 3rd floor apartment are a bit steep and not for people with mobility issues. We really enjoyed our stay and because we visit my in-laws in the Soo regularly, we will definitely be coming back."

The ability to watch the sun come up over the locks is a view that will never get old!! The location is perfect. You are across the street from the locks. Within walking distance of several restaurants, shops and coffee houses. When visting a small town who would want to be able to walk down the street and see the sights.

If I had to make one suggestion, it would be to add additional mirrors. The bathroom mirror is high and for someone short it made it very difficult for me to get ready. A mirror on the back of the bedroom door would be great to see your outfit, as would small mirror on the wall in the main area so two people are not fighting for the lone mirror in the bathroom. Aside from this, everything was perfect and we will be staying with them again."

You could tell that they had put a lot of thought and effort into it. Location is great - just a 2 to 5 minute drive from restaurants and main attractions. The one thing we noticed is that the walls between the units were thin, so we could hear our neighbor occasionally but it wasn’t a bother. I would say that the place is better suited for guests who will respect quiet hours!"

Stayed one night","Alekz was very helpful when I couldn’t find the info I needed to enter the room. The place is so tastefully renovated and they are going to be offering more amenities such as a pool, etc. We especially enjoyed the book of “before & after” photos, which also had recommendations of any outside services we may need, complete w address & phone numbers!
The only thing I can think of to add, is that another towel hook in the bathroom would be great!
All in all, a good experience!"

It was very nice to have coffee provided!
We have family in the Soo, and we will likely stay here again the next time we visit!"

Stayed with a pet","We were looking for a pet friendly place in the Soo area, visiting relatives in Brimley. Accommodations were extremely tight due to the construction work going on at the Soo Locks. We found this neat old motel on Air BnB and it was pet friendly and reasonably priced. The rooms looked good and it had what we needed, so we reserved it. When we arrived, I followed the instructions and was able to get in with no problems. There are just two small steps up to the door and they are shallow enough that I had no trouble with them. The rooms are small but big enough to fit us comfortably. The bed was so comfortable we slept very well. The decor fits nicely with the retro look. There was nothing wrong anywhere in the place and we wish we could have spent more time there. Next time we come to the Soo, we'll stay there again."

Meat/grocer next door was fun, Alpine Choclate house down the road had some killer ice cream and treats, and Bird's Eye Outfitters downtown was a great little breakfast/coffee stop with a dog-friendly patio.

Group trip","I brought a group of my college students up for a documentary project and Scott's place was PERFECT. We were running around the EUP every day, but this peaceful cabin was the perfect place to stop in for lunch and for quick naps before we went on with our day.
At night, it was the perfect place for us to relax and hang out. My students loved the fire pit and the cozy accomodations, especially when the Northern lights were out during our first night! (Thanks for the heads up Scott!)
As for Scott, he was extremely communicative and helpful and has set up one of the most well-prepared vacation homes I've ever been to. The cabin had all of the basics, but had some great quality of life things stocked up (firewood, camp chairs, etc.) that made our trip easy and fun."

He was kind and very helpful (all via text), but totally gave us our space to enjoy the cabin. The bunkroom was a HUGE hit with our 6-year old, and the woodstove (which is an option, there's also baseboard heat if preferred) made everything extra cozy. We look forward to our next stay!"

Group trip",Scott’s place is everything he promises in the description & more. We had an amazing family trip. We went to nearby Sault St Marie & enjoyed a boat trip through the locks. We hiked the trails on the property. We had a bonfire & played corn hole (provided by host). The place was very clean & inviting with firewood & chairs provided. We also played board games that were provided. My adult children drove to whitefish point at night to rock hunt & found some yooper lights. On the way home we checked out the state park in Brimley which was very nice also. I like the close proximity of everything to this air bnb. The kitchen was very well stocked. We didn’t lack any tools to make our meals. Would recommend this 10/10 & would love to return one day. It is truly a place of nature & solitude & you leave feeling mentally rested & relaxed.

Stayed with kids","Scott's cabin was immaculate. The photos and description don't do it justice - perfect for our family getaway. It is obviously well maintained, clean, well supplied with games and movies, kitchen utensils, shampoo/soaps etc.
Only 20 minutes from the Soo and 45 from Mackinac ferries, the location for us was ideal.
We had a small issue with a slow draining sink and Scott was responsive within 20 minutes offering to have a plumber come out or reimburse us for some draino. Exactly the response you'd want from a host.
Our kids did great in the bunk room. One note if you travel with an infant- there is no room in the bedroom for a pack-n-play. You could fit a narrow bassinet between the bed and the wall, or put a pack-n-play in the bunk room (or large linen closet next to the bedroom..who are we to judge 😉).
We had to cut our trip a day short, but we will be back to visit again in the future. Scott's cabin will be our new home base on the east side of the UP."

I could go on about how wonderful our stay was but I’m not going to. I highly recommend this AirBnb any time of year there’s something to do.

We were able to see the Milky Way and tons of stars. The house has everything we needed to enjoy our stay and make unforgettable memories with our kids. Scott was easy to work with and available if we needed anything. We hope to visit again soon! If you’re heading up to the UP this is a MUST STAY! Thank you Scott for allowing us to enjoy your house."

Cozy Corners was a great recommendation with great food and ambiance (very cool when the freighter went by on the river). Great jumping off point for day trips to Tahquamenon Falls and into Sault Ste Marie. Truly a terrific cabin.

Anything and everything you could think of, Scott has already taken care of. The cabin is clean, comfortable, peaceful and quiet…just what we needed, and a quick drive outside of Sault Ste. Marie makes the location convenient. There is a nice little water front park at the end of the road that is great for star gazing and catching the Northern Lights on a clear night."

We were looking for a place that was secluded, but also in close proximity to Sault Ste Marie and other points of interest in the U.P. This was the perfect spot. The cabin was on 200 acres of land and was absolutely beautiful and quiet. It was everything we wanted and needed for an incredible vacation. We are already looking to book another vacation at Scott’s cabin for later this fall. Can’t wait to stay at this wonderful cabin again soon!"

This was our second time in the cabin and it's high on our list to stay at again. Comfy bunk beds, and just enough space for everyone to feel like they're camping, but with some great amenities :)"

Stayed about a week",Fantastic host. Quick to respond to all of my questions prior to booking. The first night there we couldn't get the TV to work and he was very quick to call me and walk me through it. The cabin was very clean and equipped with so much morw than you would ever find at any other rental. My husband and I loved the seclusion and being able to relax and unwind in the evenings. I really can't think of anything we weren't happy with. I would love to see this property closer to Paradise and Whitefish Point as that is the area we really love the most. I knew that before booking though so nothing against the rental. we thought we would stay in Dafter and that would allow us to explore the other direction and head toward Drummond Island and surrounding areas. All in all a good central location to venture in different directions everyday. I would without a doubt highly recommend this rental to anyone.

There are many up to date conveniences such as laundry, Wi-Fi (important with the limited cell phone coverage in the area), charging stations. A cute coffee bar area, helps to reduce congregation in the kitchen. There is a outdoor grill and patio area. We were lucky to be there when the weather was perfect and the mosquitos were nonexistent, so outdoor time was very enjoyable. There are games, movies and other nice extras. We were only there a long weekend, and mostly to sleep so we did not use many of the options we could have."

Stayed with kids","Scott texted us on our check-in date to let us know the cleaning crew had done their thing, the house was ready for us and made sure we had the passcode to the door and contact info in case we had any issues with it.
We arrived later than we expected because we left later than expected so it was dark when we arrived. Our Garmin GPS was off on the address by about 500 feet, Apple and Google Maps are spot on by the way. Everything began to get better as soon as we pulled in to the driveway.
There are motion activated outdoor lights so if you arrive in the dark like we did you'll have plenty of lighting to navigate the unfamiliar terrain. The keypad to unlock the door was easy enough to use so we didn't have any issue with that.
You walk into a breezeway or mudroom with plenty of hooks to hand up everyone's jackets, shelves for your hats and gloves and mats for your boots. There is also a washer and dryer in this room and a washtub to wash off your boots when you get mud on them. We didn't use the washtub but it's nice to know it was there.
There is an insulated door that separates the mudroom from the rest of the house which takes you to the kitchen. The kitchen table has enough chairs to seat 8 people. Everything in the kitchen was very clean. The refrigerator was empty but cool, ready for food. The electric stove was nice. There were labels on kitchen shelves which helps to remember were things go back if you use them all up, say drinking glasses for instance.
The living room has two couches and two recliner chairs along with a TV with DirecTV and a DVD player. There was a nice selection of DVD's and books. And what our kids thought was the best part, the wood stove. Thankfully wood for the stove is provided and is easily accessible from an insulated door in the living room. This is a vestibule that contains just the wood for the stove and has another door leading to the outside.
There is one bedroom with 8 bunkbeds which are much larger than I imagined. All of our kinds are late teens, early 20's except for one so they are pretty big. They all thought they were comfortable.
The master bedroom has a comfy queen sized bed with a cozy comforter. All of the beds had sheets and blankets and were ready for someone to just hop in.
The bathroom... well, what can I say? It has a sink a toilet and a shower. :)
Oh, and almost forgot to mention the whole place is wood, the floors and and the walls. Absolutely spectacular.
The view out all the windows is nothing but woods with occasional wildlife so if you get tired of admiring the beauty of this house then just look out the window.
This house is more than just a place to hang your hat in the evening, it adds to the vacation and will be pretty high in the things we talk about."

The bunk room was perfect, and there is a nice wood stove in the living room with a drying rack above it to hang your gear on. The wood room was also well stocked and we had use of a nice sized garage. However, the driveways were too tight to turn a small trailer and the closest groomed snowmobile trail was about a 15 min ride down the roads, which wasn’t ideal for 8 snowmobilers. Thanks again to Scott for a great stay and being a great host."

The bunk bed room was nice and roomy (and made me feel like a kid again!). All we brought was our food and everything else was provided. The wood stove was super toasty after we got back from some frigid rides. Will be back again for sure!

It was a beautiful, quiet cabin covered in snow. It was a magical Christmas experience like our family (who lives in the South) has never experienced. I couldn't recommend this any more to people."

Group trip","If you're looking for a place to relax and explore, book this cabin! It's 180 acres of your own to enjoy, but ""Cozy Corners"" is less than 5 minutes away for dinner and drinks. There are grocery options in different directions, around a 15-20 minute drive.
The cabin was SPOTLESS. It was fully stocked with clean towels, sheets, blankets, bathroom amenities, kitchen essentials, a coffee bar, games/movies. The bunk beds were great and VERY comfortable. Three adults used the bunk room and were surprised how private each bed felt. We didn't expect the mattresses to be comfortable, but we were all very pleased and woke up refreshed.
It has so many extras, too- you really feel at home. The only thing I wish I'd brought was a travel mug of my own, since we decided to take some daily excursions. Honestly, we didn't need/want anything extra- just our own clothes and groceries.
The owners are great at communicating before and during the stay, and the smart lock is very easy to use.
Make an outdoor fire, some s'mores, and take in the stars at the cabin. If you enjoy hiking, enjoy their trails.
While staying, consider taking some drives. Canada was only 30 minutes away. PLEASE visit the Breakfast Pig for brunch and the Queen's Tarts for a treat to take home. Thompson's Strawberry Farm is adorable and a MUST for wine tasters. The SOO Locks were interesting to see for the water and history lovers.
About an hour and a half East- Oswald's Bear Ranch is home to 39 very happy bears. Bonus, you can feed them apples and take a picture with a cub! We combined this with an additional 30 minute drive North to Tahquamenon Falls. The Upper Falls were so impressive and humbling. The falls are handicapped accessible, but also allow for many hiking trails. We stopped for views of Lake Superior on the drive back to the cabin.
Macinac City and Island are a fun experience- about 45 minutes south of the cabin.
On our way back to the land of the Trolls (ha!), we stopped by Bronner's for all things Christmas and the Bavarian Inn for a Chicken Dinner in Frankenmuth.
A giant thank you to the owners of the cabin. This vacation was very special for my family, and we will never forget our memories and how you played a role."

Stayed with kids","Very nice secluded cabin that was well stocked with everything you need. Myself, wife, 3 daughters (ages 7, 5, & 3), and 7 month old son enjoyed the piece and relaxation of the north woods. We were a short drive to the Soo, Mackinac, and St. Ignace after morning fishing on the rivers and bays. You can spend a day at Tahquamenon Falls or Pictured Rocks. If you just want to relax then sit outside around a campfire making s’mores while enjoying some corn hole or ladder golf, or take in the sounds of nature and the fresh smell of the northern air. The girls loved having us all stay in the bunk room, and were very happy there was a private bedroom so grandma and grandpa could join us for the last couple of days. All linens were provided and having a washer and dryer were a huge bonus.
The communication was very prompt and the host provided exceptional local information. We are looking forward to another trip and hope this cabin is available when booking."

Group trip","Scott has this place STOCKED. He had giant bottles of shampoo, plenty of towels, ten+ lawn chairs, marshmallow skewers, plenty of toiletries, dishes, and pretty much everything and anything you could think of. The cabin stays cool at night and each room is equipped with either a ceiling fan or standup fans. The cabin was immaculate and although there was only one bathroom, it was spacious, clean, and fully stocked. The fire pit is a great addition and there’s a nice patio for grilling (brand new beautiful grill btw) and outdoor seating. There is ample parking and both an entryway/exit driveway. The sleeping arrangements were comfortable—everyone in the bunks were impressed with the individual lighting, hooks, and shelves in the each bunk. There were these charging stations that could charge five phones at once that saved our lives. The cabin was stocked with firewood for campfires and the indoor stove. Thank you Scott for your hospitality, your cabin is now part of our favorite summer memories!"

The amenities are so thoughtful and practical, and Scott is super easy to communicate with if anything is needed.
We followed his recommendation for the Cosy Corners Bar and Grill nearby and found it to be an excellent spot for a meal and some drinks.
Something that was notably better than any other Air BnB we have stayed at is the wifi. My brother in law was holidaying with us from Australia and works remotely. In other accommodation he hasn’t had enough service to reliably connect but this was no issue at all at Scott’s cabin. WiFi here is more than the token connection so it can be listed as an amenity. But then that’s true for the whole experience.
We will be back for sure!!"

Stayed with kids","This is a fantastic cabin property in the heart of Barbeau, right between Dunbar park/boat launch and the Cozy Cabin restaurant (and also the little country store). It's also just a quick 15 minute drive to get up into the Soo, and maybe 30 minute to buzz over to Brimley. Couldn't ask for a better location, with fantastic amenities included, that holds this number of people comfortably. We stayed here with 6 people - including a 2 and 6 year old, and had plenty of room to relax and comfortably sleep. The bunk room is awesome and the great room is super well furnished. We don't typically do a lot of camping, (and staying here really isn't hardcore camping), but it was a great mix of comfort and cabin-life for us. Scott had very attentive and well prepared communication with us and we're already planning our next trip to come back here!"

There was even bug spray available if needed, but we had brought our own. Having a washer/dryer included was also a plus! Scott has everything you need to cook indoors and outdoors. There is also a nice firepit outside. The location was not bad at all. We spent a day at the Soo and it was only a 10-15 minute drive there. Nice place to eat about 3 miles away right on the water and Neebish Island. I would recommend this cabin to everyone. Although it only had one bathroom, we made it work and we enjoyed ourselves! Thanks again!"

Group trip","Me and a bunch of friends came to stay at Scott’s place for the weekend. The house looked much nicer and different in person. It’s got that rustic feeling, but with a very modern touch. Everyone was really amazed and it clearly exceeded our expectations. The house literally had to offer everything you’d need and much more. You really don’t have to bring anything extra with yourself other than your basic necessities. I would like to make one suggestion though and this is completely my own opinion and maybe for most it wouldn’t even matter, but the only thing that I felt was absent was a dishwasher. Again, that’s just me and it’s probably because I use it so much at my own house and even that it was available at all the other Airbnb’s I rented so far. Overall, it’s an excellent place to stay which offers completely privacy also. I would definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","This is probably one of the most beautiful Airbnb's in which I have stayed, and I have stayed at many. It is comfortable, large and furnished so tastefully. The weather wasn't really cooperating while we were there so we did spend a fair amount of our time staying inside, which was no problem because it is such a cozy space. It is also within walking distance of all the great shops and restaurants that Sault Ste. Marie has to offer. I would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone who wants luxurious accommodations in this really neat little town."

Owners description of metal stairs to access apartment was spot on. Grateful we were told in advance or it could be a negative. Though for 4 seniors it was safe and not an issue.
Decor was very attractive, not surprising when we discovered the owner runs a lovely gift shop a short walk from the Loft.
Would definitely choose this place again."

Group trip","The circumstances that led us to rent the airbnb was sad due to a loss, the host, Danna was quick to respond to our needs. From the initial contacts with Danna which was primarily done via Airbnb to following house instructions she responded, in a timely manner.
The location was on the second floor. The loft filled all of our needs. It was a space where my family felt like it was their space, away from home. The loft offered my immediate family a time to reflect on memories and we continued as a family to build more memories.
Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","The rental was very open and spacious – plenty of space – even more than the pictures showed. Kitchen was well stocked if you wanted to do some cooking. One of the cleanest rentals I've stayed at – was recently remodeled I think. Host was very responsive. Location was a quick walk to downtown. Hit Wicked Sister restaurant next door and Austin Cigar Lounge a few blocks away. Only cons are the stairs to get in are outside and are metal stairs/grates (necessary for snow I'm sure). Took some getting used to. There was a little traffic noise in the front bedroom – not at night, more in the morning during the week. Not a big deal for us, we were up early."

Tons of supplies such as tp, pt, Kleenex, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. There are plenty of spices and condiments that have been left to use. Meijer and Walmart close by for groceries. Beds and linens very comfortable. Loved having air conditioning and the ability to do laundry!! Two things to be aware of: you have to be careful of noise level during business hours because the apartment is over a store. And the steps to the second floor apartment are on the outside and they are metal with a large grate. We brought our two dogs that really struggled going up and down the stairs. Their feet would get caught in the holes and we had to carry them most of the time and they are not small and don’t love being picked up. Other than that we loved the place and would definitely go back or recommend to anyone!"

The apartment itself feels spacious, it's super clean, and the kitchen is extremely well-stocked. And the location.... can't beat it! We literally walked everywhere. Dedicated parking is great as well! We had a phenomenal stay, and this cozy apartment had a lot to do with it. Only caution is the staircase to the apartment, it is a perforated metal staircase that seems a bit flimsy. Highly recommend this place to anyone!"

My husband and I took a day trip to Taquamenon Falls which was about an hour drive. The apartment is decorated so nicely and outfitted with anything you might need including extra blankets and pillows and all the pots, pans, dishes, etc to cook a full meal.
Danna was a great communicator and kindly offered to turn on the lights when I told her we’d be arriving after dark. I would definitely stay here again!"

The space was wonderful, spacious, and thoughtfully curated. Beds were comfortable, decorations were tasteful and everything you need had been thought of even down to the cookware and Tupperware to store temporary leftovers. It was tidy and clean and cleaning supplies were easily accessible and stocked. Onsite washer and dryer were an added bonus as it allowed us to travel light for the week.
We will definitely stay again!"

You stay right above a great restaurant/bar which can fill your bellies with food and spirits, the entire town is walkable and awesome to see the history of the area. Small shops and restaurants are unique and well done, the scenery is beautiful and there's a lot to do if you have kids with you. Hockey families this is your perfect tournament home base, less than ten minutes from all the rinks in the Soo and very comfortable for a between game nap, laundry to keep those sweaters fresh for the next game. My wife loved the decor and hand touches the hosts added to the unit you feel as you are staying at a family members house we loved everything about it!"

It was clean and very beautifully decorated. One thing that I appreciated very much was the attention to the small details. The hosts do not skimp on the nice toilet paper, laundry detergent, towels or soaps. I felt cared for and valued by these things! The kitchen is stocked with all the important things so this place is nice for a longer stay. There is a Roku and Apple TV which was convenient as well.
This place is conveniently located beside The Wicked Sister restaurant, which we took advantage of a few times! We also really enjoyed the location in town. We walked to the locks several times.
Danna and Terry were very kind and we were happy to meet them! We highly recommend staying here!"

But us buying another fan and mattress pad helped those issues! Julia was very responsive to the few questions we had during our stay. I definitely recommend this host and home!

There is a downstairs bedroom with bunk beds, an upstairs bedroom with two queens, and a small foldable bed that can be moved where you want it. There is a small living room, two bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchen, and laundry in the basement.
It’s not the best neighborhood and the house is a bit worn, but it is very much nicer than having to squeeze into a double room with three kids. Pet-friendly also, so we didn’t have to kennel the dog.
Having a full sized fridge was nice. We could refreeze our cooler packs and store breakfast items so we didn’t have to eat out the whole time. Our first Airbnb experience was positive!"

It was our 25th anniversary of our sorority’s founding and the space was big enough for pictures of all of us, there was enough counter space for lots of food, and parking was our biggest worry, but there was plenty with the long driveway! The stairs in the house are a little steep, so if you have problems going up and down, I’d suggest staying in the lower bedroom! And as someone who has trouble sleeping in beds that aren’t theirs, these ones were very comfy and did the job well! All in all, it’s a beautiful place to stay!"

I had brought two and had to get a polar wind turbo fan to get enough air circulation. Beyond that the house was amazing. We had an amazing time up North and being able to come back to a house after a day out. Especially with two littles was a huge relief. I would recommend staying here and will also consider this property over others next time.

Stayed a few nights","You will not be disappointed!!!!! This is a home not just a house. First, you need to know I am picky. Lol. This home was so incredibly clean and cozy!! Everything worked perfect. The water pressure in the shower was so nice. The dishes were all new and clean. I truly have nothing negative that I can say.
Things to note: the stairs to one of the bedrooms are very narrow"

Group trip","This was my first ever Airbnb rental and I was amazed by the ease of things! Julia provided us with a code to get in the home to make check in a breeze. The home was clean and had everything we needed but the food to cook several meals there. The only downfall we had was that we were not aware of how steep/curved the stairs were that lead to a lot of the sleeping area, and that the upstairs bathroom was connected to the third bedroom without a door dividing the two. Other that that minor inconvenience, our experience was great! Julia was an absolute breeze to work with!"

Stayed a few nights",Very clean and well maintained. Quick responses when we asked about baking sheets. Julia brought a set right away without even asking for her to do so. If we work in this area again we will book this place again.

Stayed a few nights","Julia’s place was perfect for our group. It was within driving distance of all the spot we wanted to visit in the UP. The waterfalls, hiking trails and really close to downtown Sault Sainte Marie. The home was comforting and the backyard was big (our dog loved that)."
