Stayed a few nights","Overall the Airbnb was a nicely decorated and furnished place, the bed had stains on it, but I was provided with new sheets, there was no toilet paper. The next day they had someone bring toilet paper, and the trash that had the name of the previous guest was still sitting on top of the trashcan, the host was very responsive and made sure to take care of anything that I had issues with. I just wish that it would have been cleaned prior to our stay because we checked in at 3 AM so we had no choice but to stay and sleep in dirty sheets on the first night"

There’s a bodega right around the corner, and even a DGX, which both are perfect for stocking up. Walking distance e to a ton of things. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed over a week","In addition to being everything I wanted in an apartment that is very centrally located, the responsiveness of the owners was unbeatable.
I was trying to leave early on Thanksgiving Day (5am) and had a problem with the door code as I was packing my car. Very stressful, as you can imagine. I messaged my hosts and within 2 minutes they called me to provide an alternate code (again, this was about 5:30 in the morning by then). I’d give a 6/5 stars if I could."

Beds were comfy, place was clean, street parking, cute kitchen with everything you could need. Kira and her co hosts were very responsive, helpful, and super nice. We left something behind and they were so kind to mail it back!! If you don’t like driving up hills (like me) don’t come up on Schick St. Pittsburgh sure is hilly 😦 Perfect spot for a night or a long stay! Thank you for allowing us to stay at your beautiful place!"

Kira was responsive and and SO helpful, though we didn’t need much, she made check in/out a breeze. The BnB is in a cute little neighborhood with lots to walk around and see. We would absolutely stay again anytime we’re in the city. Thank you so much for having us! 🫶🏽"

Stayed a few nights","Living in the city like Chicago, I never really get quiet. When I got to Kathleen's place, my first few steps in and I was in awe. It was as if I had walked into a totally different place.
On top of the homely and welcoming feeling, the apartment is very well equipped. With adjustable heating and a nice cozy and comfortable living area.
I was just telling Kathleen that I slept like a baby on the bed and now I have to get that same bed, it felt so comfortable, firm and heavenly.
The kitchen is also very modern and nicely equipped, I made dinner and breakfast during my stay, bought some groceries from Target and had a nice cup of hot earl grey tea while watching Perks of being a wallflower on her DVD player.
Did I mention I also soaked myself in the lovely tub? I always wanted a tub like hers. Just amazing.
Will most definitely return to her place if I am ever in the area.
Thanks again Kathleen!"

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend! You couldn't ask for more on The Strip. This is a great place in a great location. The apartment is just steps from some terrific seafood and Asian grocery stores, world-class bakeries (Mancini's, Enrico's) and amazing restaurants. It's a short walk to the Heinz History Center, which I greatly recommend for both adults and kids. We did have some difficulty getting into the building, which I mark down to our own ineptitude in reading directions. And parking is a beast, but that is a Pittsburgh thing. The parking apps didn't help. We finally found a lot on Smallman for $18/day."

We loved that we could park 2 cars and walk the neighborhood. The rooftop view was a special bonus, with a perspective of Downtown that gave us a real sense of place. Anastas offered us some 100-percent accurate recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance, and the clean, well-equipped kitchen and adjoining dining area made it easy to make a family-style meal and relax together after a day of exploring the city. We felt safe and welcome. Many thanks to our wonderful, communicative hosts for an enjoyable introduction to Pittsburgh."

Stayed a few nights","The airbnb was very clean and directions were clear for finding/entering the home. Recommend staying in this unit if you have plans to be out of the house most of the day. The walls are very thin and residents of the apartments will bang on the walls indicating to other units to be quiet. While brushing our teeth in the evening and talking in bed someone banged on the wall against our heads. We woke up to neighbors banging on walls on a Saturday morning indicating to other units to be quiet. Location and cleanliness of unit is good along with interacting with host, however thin walls pose a problem as residents of unit are very vocal about keeping it down."

LaShae went above and beyond to recommend local restaurants and attractions; LaShae was super knowledgeable about the city and it’s surrounding neighborhoods, as well.

My only complaint and it's a very minor one. is that the Wi-Fi was almost unusably slow. that could have just been my room but had I been there longer than a single night it would have been an issue. But again... that's a really minor complaint."

Stayed a few nights","The place was just as described and pictures in Airbnb. I stayed in a unit on the 4th floor with a view of a beautiful church just across the street. Along with the usual amenities of coffee maker/coffee/tea and creamers, Kasa certainly thought if everything a guest may need to feel comfortable and welcome. The extras like boxes water, ear plugs, make-up remover towelette and Tate’s cookies (my favorite)were a really nice touch. Kasa even went a step further and left two tokens for complimentary drinks at the bar on the first floor!!!!
I plan to stay again, however many of the weekends that I plan to be in Pittsburgh, they are already booked. If you are thinking about staying, I suggest you book as soon as possible!"

Stayed over a week","Had a good stay. I was there for a month so the space was small for my needs, although for a quick few day trip it would be perfect. Lots of good food nearby. The place is also a venue so there were concerts two nights - I heard the music in my room but it didn’t really bother me. There is a bar downstairs that is open thurs-sat. Weird hours but cute vibe. I would have liked to have had chairs with a back rather than the stools, as there wasn’t really anywhere to sit other than the bed. However, for the price and length I paid/stayed, it was very reasonable. Happy with my stay."

It’s in the heart of the city which is nice because there’s lot to do around there. One thing I didn’t know which I didn’t mind but is important to know is that the first floor turns into a club/bar on weekends so sometimes it can get loud or hectic on entrance. It wasn’t a problem though and I couldn’t hear anything from my room

I loved the updated industrial feel of the room with its ceiling height window and window seat. If I had one negative it would be that u can’t even get in the building prior to check in time. It was pouring down rain and I had to sit outside and wait. It would have been nice to be able to sit in lobby until the room was ready. That being said I will be back!

Stayed one night","Planned to stay due to reconstruction surgery and my surgeon had to push my surgery back due to another patient. It was last minute but surgeon was able to get me in 4 days later. Unfortunately it was at another hospital and staying with Kasa would no longer work. As soon as I was aware of the situation I contacted Kasa and every time I spoke with them they said that they’d defer to what AirBnBs policy and what they decided. AirBnB was willing to fully refund me even though they’re policy normally wouldn’t but needed to speak with Kasa. Kasa refused to give me a full refund. With all of my medical bills, due to my breast cancer, this was money I truly could not afford to lose. I understand policy, however, I also feel that companies need to reevaluate their practices when presented with extenuating circumstances. Especially when it involves someone’s health."

Stayed with a pet","During our two night stay there was an extremely loud “event” in the lobby until 2am and that the bass and music could be heard and felt all the way to the top floor (5th floor). We started out on the 3rd floor and our bodies were vibrating from the bass in the lobby. We waited two hours to be moved to the 5th floor after midnight. Then we were told there was no “event” the following night. The next night there was a wedding downstairs. The walls are very thin or not insulated for event purposes. Also, all communication is done via texting with a “virtual front desk” and it was not quick or efficient."

Stayed one night","I'm giving them one more star than I originally planned only because they made it right by refunding me for my stay. I had booked a one-night stay with my friend at Kasa Maverick because of its amenities and location. The check-in process and room were exactly as described. What we were not notified about before our check-in was that on the evening of our stay, the hotel would be hosting an EDM concert in their hotel on the first floor. The concert started in the evening and went on until 2am, which we heard all the way up on the third floor where our room was. Because this is a contactless hotel, there wasn't a front desk person to contact, so I messaged them on AirBnB to get the reasoning behind this. I didn't get a response until the next morning, but by that point, we had checked out and were already on the road. Overall, the hotel itself was nice, but not sure if I'd stay at a Kasa again if something like this could happen again."

We were deep asleep and we don’t even smoke. It wasn’t so much the 2:30am call that pissed me off, is after I told the guy we were asleep and don’t smoke he ended the call by telling me this was our first warning , and with a next we would be asked to leave our accommodation.
I understand they have policies but we have no idea if they got the wrong room or what. Just made our stay very uncomfortable as if we were being watched through a camera since no one is there in person.
Place is nice, but would rather stay downtown next time."

During the day I felt safe enough as a young, female and there are a few good restaurants in walking distance.

When I asked for a change of sheets housekeeping dropped a bag of sheets at my door which I had to then change myself. Afterwards attempt at communication to discuss what happened during my stay were met with inaction and placation that the “board” would review things. I have not heard back from the “board” with any updates and any message asking for a timeframe is responded with it will be reviewed.

Walkable to Whole Foods and several coffee shops, and a good central location for traveling throughout Pittsburgh. Would stay again."

I received 12 emails before I even got into the building, and 3 more since my stay. This place needs to detatch from Airbnb because it is not actually an airbnb, its a virtual hotel chain. The hotel doesnt fit the Airbnb brand and it felt a bit cheap."

Stayed with a pet",It’s like if a hotel and Airbnb had a baby— it would be this place. All of the in-room amenities of a hotel without an ubiquitous hotel staff. Perfect for those of us who just like to come and go as we please without a crowded lobby or engaging in small talk. Location is perfect for getting anywhere in the city. Duolingo’s headquarters is right next door with their cute little walk up tacqueria where you can order in Spanish and get $1 off your order. The most underrated thing about this place is the incredible view of the church out of the window of our 5th floor room. Felt like we were in Europe! Beautiful stay.

Stayed a few nights","We (two people) spent the July 4th weekend in Pittburgh and booked this place on short notice. Overall we loved the accommodations: very clean, modern welcoming furniture, soft towels, well-thought-out telly location, and a flawless check-in system (although the preliminaries asking for personal info outside AirBnB didn't inspire confidence). The location was also top notch, close to good bus stops and hip dining and shopping streets.
One little issue: the window situation by the bed really lacks privacy. Either we used a ""blackout"" screen or the room on the other side looked right into ours (and we into theirs). It would be nice to add a translucent privacy curtain that still allows daylight in."

Stayed with a pet","The Kasa was just as described and very clean. I think it is a great option for those looking for a place to rest after exploring the city. The parking near the location is cheap (I recommend you download the app because other parking around the city uses the same system) and Square Café is a two-minute walk from the spot so you can grab a quick yummy breakfast before starting your day (get that breakfast burrito!). The only issue we had was with the automated noise sensors in each room. Like all automated stuff, they are pretty indiscriminate about your activity so if you have a dog that barks a little as you head out for non-dog friendly event, or have a sneeze attack that reaches too high a decibel, you'll get an email notice threatening to cancel your reservation which is not fun. That said, we were under the impression we could leave our pup in the room if we had to head out which was not the case and that's definitely on us. They later informed us that their pet policy requires you to never leave the dog alone at the Kasa which is something to keep in mind if you are looking to do stuff without your dog. Overall, I think the spot was a good choice and I recommend it to anyone looking to pass by the Burgh and can take pups to every location you're heading."

My only negative, which really wasn’t that bad, is we couldn’t check in until 4pm and had to check out at 11am. Other than that, everything was great. I will definitely stay there again next time we come to visit!"

There is also a big park a few blocks away from the building with playgrounds for kids. We stayed here while visiting family with our daughter, who is 2.5, and it was easy for her too. Would definitely rebook if we are in town again!"

Stayed with a pet","Gorgeous building and apartment. High ceilings. Very clean. Comfortable beds. Dog-friendly building.
Be sure to be out at 10 a.m. on the nose because the keypad on the door is programmed to stop working then. We were in the midst of bringing our baggage down to the car when this happened, but luckily, we were taking turns and hadn't both walked outside at the same time.
Bring your own Kuerig pods and dish towel. There are plenty of paper towels available, however.
Linens on bed and bathroom towels were all fine hotel quality. Building is quiet, and the common areas and hallways were all extremely clean and felt secure.
Reponsive host. I'd stay here again!"

The place was immaculate and just like the photos. Easy to find and enter. Checked in using only the door code.
Raymond was a stellar host. Very proactive and responsive. I didn’t want for anything during the stay.

All the windows that brought lots of light in with a view of lots of green from the outside was amazing. I especially liked the upstairs patio. And the books…wish I could have stayed longer just to look more at all the books. I also really enjoyed the artwork and drawings. The neighborhood had so much to offer too! We were so happy and lucky to find this beautiful place. I will look for architect owners from now on when searching Airbnbs.

When you step out the door you are within walking distance to numerous restaurants, pubs and shops that are just around the corner and down the street. The space has a very nice courtyard that adds some serenity and privacy to the space, and it has its own parking space which is really nice. We were pleasantly surprised as the home was well stocked with snacks, coffee, linens, towels, toiletries, and more, plus a fully functional kitchen, and Carrie was just an awesome host answering any questions we had and making our stay extra special. The next time we’re in Pittsburgh we hope Carrie's urban abode is open as it is now tagged as one of our favorites. Thank you, Carrie!"

Quirky art, creative use of space, comfortable, rad outdoor space…I could go on for days.
Carrie was lovely in her communication and super helpful.
And the amenities? A stocked fridge, anything you could want coffee and kitchen equipment wise.
The hidden rooftop garden was a joy. A perfect mix of urban and old-timey garden.
The walkability of the neighborhood was awesome. Hit up vintage stores and had a wonderful dinner—all within a few minutes walk of the space.
Will definitely be back. Amazing. Period."

Stayed a few nights","I was looking for a place in Pittsburgh right around there and the location was perfect. Another huge selling point for me was the off-street parking which seems super rare in the area. Many restaurants in easily walkable distance. The whole place was very cool and a bit funky. The kitchen was well equipped and there were even basic condiments and many other things for the guests use which was great. The loft area where the bed is took a little getting used to with the climb up the very sturdy metal stairs - make sure you bring some shoes to wear for the climb as the slats are hardcore. The warmth up there in the summer was easily remedied by running the fan supplied directly up to help the air flow. The bed was a bit soft for me, but I like a very firm bed - also the ceiling up there is best for people under 6’ tall (which I am not) but I never hit my head. The bathroom was huge and loved the rain shower. Great place and location!"

The place is unique with a lot of personal touches and we overall enjoyed our stay - every little thing in the house is taken care of with some extra, fenced yard was great for the dog, the kitchen was stocked, loved the chocolates, great restaurants, nice location!
Since it is a converted gas station, we didn't realize the absence of sound insulation like in apartments or home, this meant everything happening outside was very audible and it made our dog anxious at nights and we didn't find the bed very comfortable. Nevertheless, it was worth the trip and thanks to Carrie for creating such a nice space that is dog-friendly."

As soon as you walk into Carrie's space, you get that ""wow"" factor that lasts until you're sad to leave. The design, decor, layout, and special touches of the space all come together so well. The mini upper garden space off the loft was a special surprise. And the private parking really made the trip extra convenient. At first, I felt hesitant to dip into the stocked fridge, but only because I'm not used to such generosity in an Airbnb! But in order to really recharge on a trip, it is extra nice to truly relax into a space. Don't miss out on enjoying a fire in the evening!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the most well stocked Airbnb I’ve ever seen and I’ve been to A LOT of Airbnbs. Cheese, eggs, bagels, chocolate, coffee, pasta, crackers, cookies… really well stocked. If I wasn’t on a diet and absolutely starving myself, I would have had a bagel. This is a LARGE space with a small, cozy upstairs loft for sleeping. The bathroom and living area are quite large. Why do the reviews keep saying it’s a small place? It’s absolutely not. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was good. I don’t think I’m the ‘converted gas station turned Airbnb’ type as the place is a bit cold and industrial (despite Carrie’s many warm, decorative touches) so I wouldn’t come back but it still gets 5-stars for its uniqueness and the well stocked fridge and coffee. I would recommend it if you’re open to something different and unique. And why wouldn’t you be?? 😀"

Will not hesitate to book again when in Pittsburgh."

Stayed a few nights","I can't recommend Carrie's place highly enough! It's an absolutely stunning loft space with a cool sense of style that feels like a home away from home in Pittsburgh. We absolutely love the design and look of the home and were sad we had to leave. We wished we could have spent more time just at the loft to enjoy the space instead of exploring Pittsburgh. Carrie had a thoughtful selection of snacks in the fridge when we arrived, which really sets the accommodations apart from an area hotel. The parking spot was really nice to have as an amenity as well. The location is great as the loft is easily within walking distance of all the Downtown Pittsburgh has to offer via the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. If you're looking for a truly unique stay in Pittsburgh, Carrie's loft is fantastic and she's an excellent host! (We also highly recommend Dish Osteria, an Italian restaurant a few blocks away.)"

That said, the industrial fire escape style ladder you have to climb to get into your cozy sleeping space is also one of the coolest things in the space. Just be careful of the spiky stairs. The modern, industrially inspired loft space in the south flats of Pittsburgh is definitely worth a visit. Both the inside and outside will surprise and inspire you. And despite the busy cityscape location the home was incredibly quiet."

We really appreciated the dedicated off-street parking space and the fenced yard for the dogs to stretch their legs - rare features when trying to find accommodations in the city! The space is very unique and quirky. The hidden garden that you can access from the loft is adorable. Well-stocked, including lots of snacks in the kitchen. The shower was great! The location is very convenient; easy walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants in the area, and an easy 45-minute walk into downtown as well; we walked to the convention center most days that we were here. Carrie was a friendly and helpful host. We would stay here again. "

Stayed a few nights","This is a great funky little place. We were visiting our daughter who lives in Pitt. We brought our 2 dogs with us and the space was great. It has a great yard with a high fence that allowed the dogs to run around a stretch out. The bathrooms has a great rain shower with great water pressure. The living space is small but just right with everything you could use. The loft area with the bed is a nice separate space. The only draw back was the bed is fairly hard/stiff. The location is great, only 1 street from the main drag. There are lots of great restaurants and bars around the block. There was a great cocky bar 2 blocks away and the British chip show at the e d of the block had a great breakfast we brought back to the house and ate out front. Would recommend ."

We enjoyed walking around the immediate neighborhood. La Petit Cafe for breakfast and The Vault Taproom for dinner were both great choices.

The home was appointed with towels, shampoo, soap and all kinds of snacks. It was so nice to have our own parking spot so when we came home there was no searching for street parking. Dog friendly home and even had a cut out in the fence for Fido to see out. The furnishings were eclectic and modern and gave a cool vibe to the house. Be ready for a fire escape staircase to the bedroom loft--and bring a good pair of slippers or socks to protect your feet from the grates. Overall, excellent experience for our Pittsburgh trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Really cool spot in a great location of Pittsburgh. Fenced in yard to hang out in and relax, and do some reading - Carrie has a ton of great books to choose from, and quite the collection of awesome chairs.
Only downsides at all would be the mattress isn't the most comfortable in the world. For us, it led to not the best nights of sleep. To others though, it might be perfect. Beyond that, the stairs to go up to the loft are industrial grate ones, with raised metal for tread. Perfect style for the converted garage, but rough on feet. If you come prepared for that / bring slippers, then it's no big deal.
Overall, awesome stay in a unique Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic place. Clean, cozy, funky, well-stocked and in a phenomenal location if walking to anyplace in Southside is part of your agenda. Carrie is an excellent Host and was very accommodating with my schedule. It's just a minute walk to Carson St. and there's so much going on there. You're also far enough off the main thoroughfare that noise isn't a detriment. The lodging is close to the sidewalk so that if a group walks by talking loud you'll hear them for a few seconds but I was there on both Friday & Saturday night and it was fine for sleeping as I had some concerns before. Do note that the bed (which is a comfy mattress on the floor) is in the loft with a 6ft ceiling and you have to climb a metal staircase (kinda like a fire-escape) to get there. I didn't mind, it's part of the place's charm and efficiency, but be aware in case that isn't for you. No doubt I'd stay again."

If you want to stay close, here are our local recs: Delanie's was our choice for walkable coffee, and we got donuts from Just Good Donuts inside the Pub Chip Shop. We opted for giant slices of pizza from Benny Fierro's."

I stayed there in late December, and each day was either in the 30s or rainy in the 50s/60s.
My 15 years old dog loved the perfectly-sized enclosed yard and patio. I'd really like to come back when everything's in full bloom.

Stayed a few nights","I want to start this review with the fact I visited mid November. This property is def best as a summer stay. (To utilize the garage door, the secret garden, and the wonderful outside set up)
The place is so cozy, I didn’t mind not having a day to open that garage door. It was a little cold, which I expected as it’s a brick and concrete building that wasn’t built to be crazy insulated. The secret loft garden was wonderful to stare out into, and see the bundles of Mourning Doves that came to the trees in the morning. There’s plenty to do just literal minutes away. The only thing I would have changed is to bring some house shoes to wear up and down the loft steps. They’re old warehouse steps, and they’re a little sharp. It certainly did not ruin my stay, though. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat."

Stayed a few nights","Great location in the heart of Southside- steps from tons of shopping and food— easy drive to anywhere else in pgh you want to get to. The house itself was a cool retrofit but some elements people should be aware of. House was pretty cluttered and there was little storage to be had. stairs to loft were a challenge and there was definite consistent bugs, spider webs, etc to contend with. In balance, location was fantastic and parking a real perk, but folks should understand the space has some minor issues."

Like other reviewers said the loft is a mattress on the ground but the space is wonderful overall. We couldn’t believe all the little extras from bagels/bfast items in the fridge to firewood for the outdoor fire pit. Would definitely stay again!

Stayed a few nights","Carrie's place is a small but enjoyable place to stay. There's an off-street parking spot that helps a lot in the Southside, where parking can be hard to find. Also it's just a block from the main stretch of Southside, so there are tons of easily walkable shops and restaurants for pretty much anything you are craving. And it's a quick commute anywhere in the city as well.
The place is small and is not suggested for groups larger than 2 or 3. There's just a double mattress in the loft and a couch in the living area. But it was a nice cozy place to spend the weekend. Carrie was more than accommodating and even messaged us in the middle of our stay to make sure we didn't need anything."

Stayed a few nights","Pros: the outside area was awesome for our pup and was very private.
The bed was on the floor but was comfy but my boyfriend is 6”2 and his feet hung off the end of the bed.
Upstairs garden loft was cool, but there weren’t any gardens or plants.
Breakfast was provided: 3 eggs, cheese, milk, OJ, coffee, and creamer. The cheese was moldy and I didn’t realize until after I poured it all over my eggs.
All cooking essentials were provided.
Wood was provided for the fire pit.
Kitchen was new appliances.
Location was perfect and in walking distance to almost everything on the Southside.
Carrie was quick to respond.
Cons: There is decorations on every inch of the space that there wasn’t much space for us to put our own things down. It felt as if we were staying in someone else’s everyday home instead of a spot for guests to come and make it their own.
It was very hot sleeping in the loft but Carrie let us know about a fan in the basement which helped a lot.
Some bugs here and there but it is a converted gas station."

Having a dedicated off street parking spot made coming and going super easy, and we always felt safe in the home. The sleeping situation was just okay but is well represented in photos. The mattress is a little soft because it sits right on the floor, but once you see the lofted space, you realize it would be difficult to put a real bed there! We didn’t have any problems while we were there, and Carrie was quick to respond when we asked about check-out instructions. There are many restaurants and stores within walking distance. The space is very unique, and we would stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights","There's something magical about Carrie's place. We went to PGH for a couple's retreat to work on our writing and art projects, as well as to relax and get away from home. The space has excellent light, amazing style, and a great location. We were intrigued by all of the books, art, and objects on display. (Even though the space is small, it felt spacious even with all of the cool stuff around). Being surrounded by art and great style was definitely conducive to our creativity. On an unseasonably warm weekend in early November, we enjoyed the yard and loft garden. We had a fire in the outdoor fireplace every night (we brought our own wood) and even opened the big garage door for fresh breezes on a golden afternoon. The place is a block from Carson Street, which for us was a plus: hearing and seeing the city sounds and sights was invigorating. I rode my bike all over the neighborhood. Carrie very thoughtfully provides a fairly well stocked fridge and pantry in case you forgot something. Cooking in would definitely be possible, but it was also very easy to get take out from places on Carson. (Shout out to Benny Fiero's Pizza and Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House!) The place definitely has its quirks: bring slippers or you'll want to wear your shoes up the stairs to the loft, because the treads are pretty spiky. But the sleeping loft was cozy, and we slept very well. The two of us lived quite happily in the gas station for a long, four-day weekend. We would absolutely love to go back!"

Stayed about a week","We loved our stay at Carrie’s place. The house is so unique and has tons of light. It’s a very cheery place to hang out. The yard is huge and has a chiminea. We enjoyed spending the evening around the fire. All the passerby’s commented on how awesome the house was!
The kitchen is stocked full of great food. It was great to not have to immediately run to the grocery store. It was a really nice amenity and adds a lot of value for the price of your stay.
There were a few negatives (but I still wholeheartedly recommend Carrie’s place. ) The first negative is the metal stairs to the loft. The treads are little metal spikes pointed up! Be sure to bring slippers! The second is that there is a fair amount of dust in some of the nooks and crannies. The overall appearance is clean but it could use a more thorough dusting. Bring your allergy meds if you have allergies.
The toilet doesn’t have a powerful flush. I’m a petite woman and have NEVER needed a plunger before. Well, I guess there is a first for everything. :)
The shower gets warm but not quite hot. It wasn’t uncomfortable but I would have preferred it a little warmer.
We tried to use the oven and it made a horrible noise and so we turned it off. Carrie responded right away and said it was safe to use but the cooling fan needed to be fixed and a maintenance person was coming the next week.
Two kind of funny things. There are four lamps that are just for decorations and don’t have an outlet to plug them in. And there are also a LOT of pillows! Something like five on the couch, seven on the bed, and four extras in the drawers. But no extra blanket for the bed. I guess you should just bury yourself in pillows if you get cold!
But, seriously, you have to stay here. It is awesome and fun and the location can’t be beat. The off-street parking spot is also a huge perk."

Stayed a few nights","A very unique property! Carries was prompt in addressing an issue that came up and handled it for me without any difficulty.
The location was great and right near a lot of food and attractions. Getting to the property off the main high way was fairy easy and didn’t have a lot of traffic.
The space itself offers a unique place to hang out before heading out and lay your head. I do wish the sleeping space was larger and was generally hotter than the rest of the house. The kitchen is great and she offered a lot of snacks and refreshments to help ourselves too. There seemed to be plenty of utensils available if cooking needs to be done during the stay, but I didn’t stay in for meals. Plenty of counter space.
The bathroom is spacious. The shower is just awesome. Washer and dryer was available.
Carrie was quick to communicate with me. She offered a direct contact number if I needed to use it, but she replied quickly on the Airbnb app when I sent her a message about an issue I was having. She showed me compassion and understanding and worked with me to resolve my experience.
Ultimately, a space that may not work for everybody, but it is a very different spin on real estate and living space that is awesome to see and experience."

The kitchen seemed well-stocked, though we did not have opportunity to use all that. One area to improve might be providing a set of extra pillows and a top sheet for the bed. The duvet was a bit much, considering that the room was pretty warm ( the first night we used the ceiling fan).
Be advised that since the house is older, every creak and groan from upstairs units and adjacent stairways are audible, so bring earplugs if you’re a light sleeper.
The neighborhood was very quiet, though, with adequate nearby street parking. Up the street there is a good coffee shop—a two minute walk. The location is very convenient—near the Shadyside area that has many good shops and restaurants."

She responded very quickly anytime of the day and even allowed me to check out check out at a later time so I can finish laundry. The place was very nice and modern. It was close to downtown which was very convenient as that’s where all restaurants, activities, and more are located. We loved our stay and would stay here again in the future."

We appreciated the thoughtful consideration of guest needs including a clothes hamper, a large wardrobe, and wine glasses in the kitchen. I want to also mention that the lovely, ornate wooden banister and large gorgeous stained-glass window at the entrance to the rooms added to the charm of this wonderful Airbnb!"

Stayed over a week","This apartment is exactly what you would expect from the photos. It’s small but it has everything you need. I think it’s better for 1 person to stay there, it was a little small for two people for one month although it might be better for 2 people staying a shorter time. I was pleased to find that Natallia constantly supplied tissues, coffee, hand soap, etc.
the place was very quiet in an excellent location that’s a short walk to restaurants and supermarkets and a short drive to anywhere else I was interested in visiting in Pittsburgh.
Natallia was also excellent at responding quickly. My roommate forgot some items after we checked out and the host was kind enough to stay in touch so we can get the items back. The only problem with this apartment would be the extremely thin walls. Luckily it was never noisy but you can definitely hear neighbors if they’re loud or going up and down the stairs (not really the host’s fault)."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Natallia's while visiting our son who is a student at PITT. What a great location! You can walk to everything... the market to grab a few groceries, cute coffee shops for breakfast, and lots of restaurants/bars for a meal or cocktails. The neighborhood is charming with big beautiful houses full of character and architectural detail. Natallia's unit had everything we needed for a weekend. It is updated with modern finishes and the inside of our unit was nice and clean. There was a little clutter in the hallways, but nothing that interfered with movement through the building. The rules might seem strict with asking guests to remove their shoes while on the stairs and in the apartment, but it is needed. We could hear everything in the unit above ours, so if you are a light sleeper, this might not be the place for you. We needed to contact Natallia during our stay due to a concern with an employee, and her response was immediate. She immediately addressed the problem and apologized for the inconvenience."

Stayed one night","SAFETY AND HARASSMENT! At check-in, my four digit key code did not work on the outside door I was supposed to use. I tried to use my code on the second outside door that was for the first floor, which I wasn't staying on, and it did not work. I tried the first door again - no luck. Second door again - it worked, though, again, not the correct floor. I went in, thinking there might be a mistake with the reservation and worried about not being able to get in period. My code opened one of the doors on the first floor, but it clearly was not ""my"" room, as there was other people's stuff in the room! Tried the first outside door again. Code worked. Went to third floor. After trying two to three times, my code opened the door to a room that was, I came to realize, also not the room I reserved. I did not realize it immediately, however, because (1) the room was empty, and (2), since my code worked, it seemed logical that this was my room. When leaving to go to dinner for which we had a timed reservation, I looked again at my check-in information and that is when I realized I was, alas, in the wrong room. Went to, at long last, the correct room where I found that my code also opened that door as well (after a few tries). I messaged Natalia about this on the way to dinner. She was concerned - not because my code opened so many doors - but because there was to be another party checking into the room my (and the two others in my party) stuff was in. I asked her if she or her cleaning lady or another could move the items. She said no because her cleaning lady lives 20 minutes away and she was 'over seas'. I offered to just stay in the room we were in, and allow the other party to take our room (which was quite an upgrade for them). Myself and my two friends (all three of us house wives pushing 50 on a girl's trip weekend) got back to ""our"" room sometime around 11 p.m. By 12:30 a.m. we were asleep. Beginning at 7 a.m. the next morning, and lasting until close to 8 a.m., I received 7 phone calls and 5 texts from Natalia, and I'm not sure how many messages through AirBnb from Richard (whom I assume is Natalia's husband), informing me that there were ""multiple"" complaints logged through the night about our being loud. I was told we had to ""get out now!"" various times or ""security"" would be sent to ""remove us"". First and foremost, this was disrespectful, at best, and more along the lines of harassment and bullying. If there were multiple complaints filed about our party between roughly 11 p.m. and midnight, why did we not hear about it until after 7 a.m. the next morning? And, if our laughing (there was no music playing, no tv on, no alcohol was consumed throughout our entire weekend) was so disturbing as to cause the need to file ""multiple"" complaints, than the walls must be paper thin. In fact, I feel obligated to add for others who may be considering this place that the doors that lead into each rented space are significantly thinner than the closet doors in my home. To make a long story longer, I would say there are three lessons to learn here. One, I should read my check-in directions more closely the next time I stay at an AirBnb (though it won't be this one) to be sure I'm going to the right room the first time. And, two, this particular place is INCREDIBLY unsafe. I was able to open FIVE doors with my ""personal"" code. I should have only been able to open two. Presumably, I could have opened every door - there is no good reason to think otherwise. And, finally, three - Natalia is unbelievably disrespectful, to the point of blatant harassment. The ONLY good thing I can say about this place is that it was clean, though I did kill an ant. Buyer beware."

Stayed over a week","This is my second stay in Natallia's apartment. I stayed in for three weeks to stay close to my CMU daughter. I have already considered it as my second home for the following reasons:
1) The apartment is very comfortable, the facilities are really good.
2) The location is very convenient for all purposed. I traveled to downtown, to CMU, Pitts, Schenley Park, Frick Park, etc. I sometimes travel with a car, sometimes take a bus -bus stop is 4 minutes way.
3) The place is safe and quiet. I really like the digital locks and the system Natallia sets for all guests.
4) There are enough parking spaces on the street.
5) Communication with Natallia is very easy, she responses to my request or questions within an hour.
Thank you Natallia! When I plan my next trip to Pittsburgh, I will book your C2 apartment again!"

My partner and I were to stay at Natallia's for the weekend, but unfortunately had to find new accommodations due to some other rule-breaking guests. Natallia was understanding and communicative, and handled our situation with compassion and aplomb. These things can happen anywhere.

Neighborhood felt very safe. We were a little turned off by the severity of the rules at first, as these units cater towards business travel and we were coming for leisure. It wasn’t the most welcoming feeling. And while there is a strong suggestion against drinking the tap water, I was surprised that there was no accommodation for providing drinkable water in the unit with a filter pitcher or something similar. Still a great stay for the price and would definitely stay here again."

The pool area is nice and there is a beautiful park right across the street.
Our only complaint - Upon arrival, the hotel had no record of our reservation through Airbnb and thankfully they honored my confirmation through Airbnb and were able to find a room for us. Call the hotel after you book to make sure they have your reservation!
I would absolutely stay here again and felt that this was a very good deal for everything the hotel offers!"

Pittsburgh has so much construction going on so driving can be full of anxiety but the valet parking really helped, and the clean room helped ease my worry when driving all day! Wonderful place to stay and VERY nice and responsive host!!! Answers all your questions promptly and comes across with genuine care. Highly recommend this place!"

A lot of great walkable restaurants to check out and the arena was about a 15-20 min walk. The room was great, clean and comfortable and the hotel as a whole felt really welcoming the second you walk in. Would definitely come again!"

The fitness center had multiple machines and free weights to choose from. The city was a short walk away, and had tons of great restaurant options. I had one small issue with billing, but the staff was super helpful and helped resolve it right away. I'd definitely stay here again when I return to Pittsburgh."

The room was pretty small and the parking was honestly a mess and very inconvenient but that’s the only complaint I have. $43 per night for parking and it can take 10+ mins for valet to get your car in the busy and crowded valet pickup. But everyone was very friendly!!! Room was clean and it was a nice scenic location (:

Stayed one night","Checking in was a huge hassle. There was valet parking only at the hotel (even though self-park was advertised). Self-park is only available at a garage about 1/2 block away. All luggage had to be unloaded in the valet area, & there were very few luggage carts, leading toa long wait. The elevators are key-card operated on the INSIDE and I got stuck inside one because my key card was not working—other people were able to select their floorsut I had to wait until someone else got on and used their card to go to the lobby. There also seemed to be some sort of middle/high school girl's basketball tournament going on with many teams being hosted at the hotel, leading to lots of mostly unsupervised teenage girls jogging elevators, running through the halls, and making lots of noise. Four stars because I was able to at least get breakfast comped after my hassles & the room itself was clean with a nice view."

Stayed a few nights","The stay was amazing, but the building needs work done as the hole on the grand plaza floor (24th floor) ceiling was exposing insulation, and the cracks in the rooms crown molding. The Toiletries were nice but not accommodated for each night of the stay and I received a text to check out only after one night of my stay which was paid and booked for two nights.
The elevators are so heavily used I felt like I was on a county fair ride, and contemplated getting right with God each trip up, and each trip down. I did get stuck on the 7th floor between 7th and 8th and the elevator finally started moving after a quick five minute facetime call to my partner to say my goodbyes that I may starve and never see her again.
The saving grace for this review was the level of acumen and communication with the staff at the Wyndham Grand. They understood quickly what the issues were and to fix these it only took a few minutes out of my time.
The location and view was beautiful and all in all, 4.5/5!"

Stayed one night","Very large room and very comfortable bed. This is an upscale hotel, so there is valet parking and bell service so be prepared to tip accordingly (although it was worth it and the staff, especially the valets were exceptional). Lovely views from the room (You can see some of the river and the scoreboard at PNC park). Pretty quiet. Very relaxing. Enjoyed a drink at the hotel bar and was not disappointed (made nice and strong for the price). The room was a little bit outdated and the pictures of the bathroom are not accurate (it is not a handicap accessible bathroom). The bathroom itself was OK but the shower was a little underwhelming and very tiny. Enjoyed the walking distance to restaurants/brewery. Overall loved our stay and would go back. The host was also very responsive and helpful!"

The walls are paper thing and we could hear the occupants next door getting off in greater detail than I cared to. There were hairs from previous guests, I assume all over the place which leads me to believe that the room wasn’t vacuumed prior to our arrival. The bed was missing a sheet, and I get that some Airbnb’s don’t include this, but this is a hotel, and there was no notice that we were expected to provide our own. Otherwise, it was a safe place to stay, it was mostly clean, well located, and easy to check in and out."

It definitely was not worth paying $173 for one night. The walls were paper thin and I could hear the loud tenants next door. My room had the smell of marijuana smoke either from a previous occupant or the rooms next door. Overall, this is what I’d expect from a hotel that’s $50 per night. Not worth it."

Now Off of checkout I finally seen the room it was half of what was pictured it had one small window and it showed a building and a roof below (The room also had no hot water after this I got discouraged and packed up and went to check out they changed my Room And finally asked what the reasoning on why I was checking out I told them … then it was explained to me where everything was And Then they offered to change The room To the Actual one in the Picture and not a closet
Room 1129 ( was not the room in the picture That’s what I was given

Stayed a few nights","The place is within walking distance to just about all the restaurants and shops in downtown, we were able to take the T to the steelers game and back! I only did valet for 1 night because it was expensive even though they did provide with in/out privileges. I found a nearby garage within walking distance for half the price and parked my vehicle for half the price, which also provided in/out privileges. I was on the 12th floor and it was fairly quiet for being there during the holidays, the room was clean but as many other reviews have mentioned a fitted sheet would make a better sleeping experience since the flat sheet that is used does come off at times."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was great!!! The hotel was clean as well as our room! Despite being very busy due to an NFL game and Christmas weekend, the hotel staff were all kind and worked hard to get us checked in quickly.
When we got to our room our TV wasn’t working so I called down to the front desk for help. They sent an engineer to our room within minutes of my phone call and after 5 minutes our TV was working! The engineer was so kind and helpful!
Overall, the hotel & its location was great! Quick walk to street and garage parking, to many different restaurants, and a few minutes walk to the bridge to cross over to the North Shore!"

We were woken many times due to neighbors having too much fun. The bathroom was also very small and made it hard for two people to be in there at once to get ready."

There was mold or stains in the grout if the bathroom. The bathroom door was difficult and noisy to close. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom for smells and steam.

Stayed a few nights","The Wyndham Grand was such a nice change from the usual Airbnb situation we choose when visiting Pittsburgh. We go 2-3 times per year to visit our daughter at Point Park University and staying in a proper hotel was such a nice experience. The staff was friendly, the place was quiet, there was food, wine and coffee easily accessible in the hotel as well as a nice gym. Those are all things I really like having close by. The location was excellent, making all downtown experiences easy. This LA family loves Pittsburgh. My only complaint is the thing a lot of hotels do now and that’s cheap bedding. I hate that fitted sheets aren’t used. That’s such a 1st world complaint, but seriously, nice bedding makes a huge difference. Housekeeping was super friendly and attentive so I am not going to complain too hard, but come on - fitted sheets please! 😁"
