Stayed about a week","Laura was an amazing host. We went to visist family in Andrews for the Thanksgiving holiday and needed to add a few more days to our stay; Laura was so helpful and accomodating. The muffins and note on check in were so sweet. There were plenty of towel and they were soft a fluffy! Check in was a breeze with simple insturcitons and the house was easy to locate. All the extras in the house were a nice touch, washing supplies, stocked kitchen, bathroom amenities, etc. We had a great time visiting family and a nice place to relax each night."

She was respectful of our schedule. The house had everything we needed. Our kids loved the back yard. Let me tell you, the washer has an agitator & it got the yuckiest of toddler stains out!! 10/10 recommend. If we ever need a place to stay in Andrews again, we will reach out to see if this one is available."

The house is located in Patk Terrace, a very nice location. I was there 4 days and I only saw one car drive by, so it is indeed a private location. There are lots of windows in the kitchen and living areas.
The host was very accommodating with my arrival and departure dates."

The fenced backyard was great for our pups to run after hours in the car. Quiet and safe neighborhood. The home has some rules (eg no pets on furniture) and check out tasks that I recommend reviewing before booking. I'd definitely recommend this home!

I’m very particular about smells: I am not happy when the house smells like an old place when not fully renovated and when there are too many detergents & scents. This house was perfect. The home also had a big fenced backyard and beautiful grass (they hadn’t had it in the pictures when I chose the place), so our dogs had such a great surprise, and I didn’t have to worry about having them on leash. Thank you for being a great host, Jordan!"

It was extremely windy and cold one day so we had to remain indoors, the extra throw blankets they had along with the dark shades made for the perfect movie day.
The pillows, beds and blankets were super comfy and the place was spotless! For being in such a small town this home was immaculate!
We'll be back for next year's Chicken Fried Steak Festival and will be booking again. 😊"

House was great, comfortable, and quiet. It was a great end to the day. I always worry about comfy beds. The mattress was fantastic, pillows were better than most high end hotels. I slept like a rock. I’ll definitely book again."

Stayed a few nights","This was the weekend of the grand opening for the West Texas Living Heritage Museum in Seminole Texas,and this country homes served the perfect getaway for guests to come and enjoy.
And I truly feel that it was meant to be that we could put our guest who were from the Comanche nation, making it like a homecoming to Gaines County, this beautiful country home just a little out of city limit where you have a clear view of the beautiful sunsets and sunrises that we are famous for here in West Texas.
The front porch rocking chairs was such a home like touch. And much appreciated. Coffee on the front porch in the morning, watching the sun come up sitting on the rocking chair in 2023 is a gift in its self.
We live in such a fast paced world, to take a moment in the on the front porch in the country is like a good summer rain in the desert. Highly recommend this beautiful home.
Thank you Kyle."

Stayed with kids","The place was very clean and spacious . Host was great and very responsive . However , feedback is to provide a better experience for future guests: ( we had 2 adults and 2 kids under 5 yrs)
1. There were no pool towels. We had to use bath towels, in which there were not enough towels because the ""pool towels"" became really dirty with the midland dust after taking outside
2. Kitchen is slim. 2 coffee mugs. 6 plates . 4 water glasses. No mixing type bowls/large salad/pasta bowls.There is no plastic in the place- so bringing a glass water cup outside was risky. It's pretty bare bones !
3. We had half a roll of paper towels and ran out quickly with no extras . No dish towels.
4. No laundry soap provided
5. Out of the 3 days we were there- the host showed up 2 times ( he messaged that he would have to drop by and clean the pool , and the meet a warranty repair person ) although host was accommodating and responsive - I still didn't want him dropping by at less than ideal hours ."

Stayed with kids","I stayed here with my kids for a few days to visit dad while he’s working out here in the oil field… a hotel is just not suitable for small children who need to run & play and be loud while they are doing cartwheels and watching tv and playing all day, the price was very fair as she had a full kitchen to use and I cooked every day and cleaned up after myself. She was stocked up with towels and linen very very nice and clean the backyard was perfect for them to play in & they made friends with some of the neighborhood kids it was a good experience! She has bedside chargers just in case you forget yours. Felt very very at home and peaceful. Hot tub is a big plus once the kids went to bed after we played games in the garage before bath and bed! It was just a good experience."

We want to say a huge thank you to getting new ping-pong balls (on the coldest day ever) and dropping them off so the kids can stay busy!!

Will love to stay there again hopefully ❤️"

Stayed with kids","We would give 4.5 stars if we could! The only reason why we wouldn't give 5 stars is because of the hot tub. The heater struggled to get hot enough for my husband and he gave up on using it that first night. I'm not sure if it was just too cold outside, but we were really looking forward to using it. We did not get a chance to try it again before we left. I would have also loved to have charging ports on the bedside nightstands and maybe a place to hang coats near the front door. Otherwise, EVERYTHING was gorgeous, clean and very well stocked! We were not there as much as we thought we would be, so we did not get a chance to enjoy the game room either. The house was very spacious as well. Adrianne checked in regularly and was very upbeat and positive! We enjoyed our stay in her home."

Unassuming from the outside, but so accommodating on the inside. Really lovely and nearly brand new - we felt so lucky! Thanks ever so much.
Andrews was new to us and a very pleasant surprise. The best playground we have ever been to and we visit them all! Pond, ducks, and gorgeous playground. Such a clean city with lots of renovation. Western Sizzling was also a lovely surprise! We wish your city the very best and hope to visit again someday soon!"

We feel we found the best place to stay in Seminole. Our hosts were very accommodating. They spared nothing in building these gorgeous apartments in a former post office building. They are modern, state of the art, professionally designed and decorated with fine furnishings, including 2 very large televisions. The kitchen is very well equipped.
Everything is extremely clean.
Check-in is easy with keyless entry. The building is very secure!
Communications with the host yield quick responses.
Melissa is a new Airbnb host, but it won’t be long before she will be a Super Host! In our book, she already is a Super Host as we can honestly say that we’ve had none better than she.
The location is perfect, within walking distance of many amenities including a nice restaurant, coffee shops, shops, and grocery store.
We feel Very Blessed to have found “You Got Mel”."

The photos don’t really show the place that well , as a surprise the house had plenty of space , large tv in the living room . Large Back yard , definitely will stay again . The host was great and easy to work with .
The location is between Odessa and Midland and easy access to either city . There is a gas station really close to the house for basic. Needs , also Rustic cafe really close as well for breakfast , Lunch and very convenient even for a quick coffee.
We look forward to our next stay :)"

My daughter was able to stay on her schedule away from home. This place gave us a little cozy home to come to and my husband and I could watch TV or play a video game while our slept peacefully in the room. Terri’s place literally at everything. We forgot our Pack and Play at home and she had one. Totally saved us from having to buy another one. Terri and I kept up great communication. She was very responsive to messages. We asked if we could check out an hour later since we all slept in and Terri had no problem with this request. Next time we visit family in Midland, I hope this place is available. Thank you so much Terri, truly."

When I pressed the location on the app. I thought I had placed the request for two nights. I found out later that I only had a single night and the cost was over $260 for just a single nights stay. The house was fine, the airbnb sofware application was confusing for a first time user."

Very quiet neighborhood. She responded very quick to my request. The price was the best and because of that we could spend one more day with our niece other way we could have spent only few hours visiting her. Brenda allowed us to invite my niece for dinner.

roast marshmallows by the pool and enjoy a great day of swimming. This is the place.
when I booked this place I did not know what I was getting myself into . it was definitely more than I expected. Junior is such a helpful and respectful host.
I will definitely be booking again in the near future love this place so much

Stayed a few nights","Junior and his house were wonderful. We couldn’t have been more happy with our choice to stay here! The house was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Junior was very responsive to all of our questions before and during our stay. We will definitely stay here next time we are in the area."

Stayed with kids",The home was exactly as described; we noted cleanliness and comfort as being a top priority for the host. The bedrooms were enormous! There was definitely plenty of room for our group. The host was very responsive and helpful. We welcomed the peaceful and quiet atmosphere; the pool was the added bonus that we most enjoyed!
