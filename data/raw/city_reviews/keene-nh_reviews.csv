Stayed with kids",This apartment is a little kooky in its location being that you have to walk across the roof to access it but the moment you step in it’s super clean and beautifully done. Every detail is well thought out. I really enjoyed staying there and it’s right by downtown. It was just the relaxing spot I needed.

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Hannah's place! Hannah was very proactive with communication ahead of our stay which helped with a very smooth checkin process and made us feel like we could go to her for anything we needed throughout our stay. The apartment is incredibly spacious and accomodated our 3 guests perfectly. We were a little unsure about navigating up to the apartment at first and there was one icey night where it felt sketchy to walk across the rooftop even with the grip pads, but once inside we were able to relax and felt right at home!"

Stayed a few nights","Hannah's UpTop rooftop appartement was really exceeding our expectations. It is so spacious and nice decorated. Everything you want to have is there, even a special space for our yoga and tai chi exercises. The living room is a little bit cold so we did not spend time there. No problem: we like to spend time at the kitchen table. Keene is a nice town and the apartment is within walking distance of a really nice supermarket that sells organic locally produced food. In main street there a few nice restaurants.
We stayed two days longer than planned!"

Stayed a few nights","Our time at Hannah’s place was one of our favorite stays to date! We were wowed by how pristine, cozy and spacious the apartment was. It was quiet, private, and the rooftop location was quite straightforward to access. The kitchen had more dishes/utensils than needed for the maximum amount of guests allowed - usually we run into the opposite with most airbnbs. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, spending time in the living space and we wish we had time to play the many games available. There were so many thoughtful touches, such as lovely decor, free tea, coffee and snacks, and easy access with the keypad. There were even yoga mats for 4 and plenty of space to use them! Everything was so clean and tidy and we had no issues. Hannah sent clear instructions and great recommendations for dining before we even asked, too! The area was so cute and there was tons to do - we loved the speakeasy and went back twice. We would LOVE to come back! Thanks Hannah!"

Stayed one night","Hannah's place is unique, cute and very clean! It's in a great location for walking to restaurants and little shops. We appreciated the basket of snacks left for us and it had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable overnight. If you're traveling with young children, please heed the considerations Hannah has included. A parent would need to be very conscious about the rooftop area along with keeping the safety gate closed to the nook with the twin mattress as it has a steep stairwell. We had only our teenager so no concerns.
We will definitely consider staying here again in the future. Thank you, Hannah!"

Stayed a few nights","I had visited a friend this summer while they stayed at The Rooftop. I liked it so much, that I booked it as my first airbnb stay for my birthday weekend. I loved the cozy homey feeling of the unit but yet it has so much unique space to spread out and enjoy yourself!
Hannah was fantastic with communication without being intrusive. She made sure to answer any questions. The unit was extremely clean and inviting and was perfectly stocked with all items you’d need, as well as those you might not think of!
The rooftop is an ideal location to just get away and relax or go enjoy a night or two on the town :) I look forward to seeing what the new renovations will be at this already ideal space!!"

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay in Hannah’s apartment. It was very easy to access with the simple instructions she sent us. The apartment was clean and matched all the pictures. There was plenty of space to hang out in the futon/TV room, kitchen, second living area with yoga mats and bean bags, and the bedroom. Kitchen was well stocked with utensils and dishes, and dishwasher was a great feature. Bathroom was clean and water was hot. My girlfriend loved the interior design and made sure to take lots of pics of everything. Would definitely reccomend based on cleanliness and proximity to an awesome downtown area."

We needed a getaway while visiting family for the holidays and Hannah’s place served as the perfect sanctuary from the open floor plan to the board games and books, we had a ton of space to relax and enjoy some quiet time. They even put out sand on the walkway on one of the colder nights when some puddles iced over. Great place, great host!"

You can walk to town with shops and restaurants in just a few minutes and there is also a large grocery store very close to the apartment. I loved the yoga/meditation room and made sure to use it. Hannah's communication was prompt and friendly. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a nice and relaxing getaway which is still close to a town."

On top of that, Hannah was very responsive and super friendly. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Keene!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the nicest places I've ever stayed. The location was an absolute dream to be able to walk to Keen Music Fest, but even on a day there aren't dozens of performances, to be able to walk to great restaurants and shops would be nice.
There was an amazing view from the deck, and the apartment had nice big windows for lots of light and air.
The futon was super comfy and all the amenities - sheets, towels, coffee, were great. Everything was in great condition and so pretty.
My only regret was a didn't give myself a chance to try the extra large bathtub."

It’s like a 30 second walk to Main Street with all of the shops and restaurants, but yet it’s incredibly quiet. The apartment itself is huge. I loved the yoga space (Hannah even provides yoga mats!) The whole space has a very laid back vibe to it, very relaxing. It has pretty much everything you will need during your stay. Check in was a breeze and the place was spotless. Hannah is awesome- very responsive, very nice. I highly recommend this place if you’re coming to Keene and I would 100% stay here again."

Great parking in the back, with plenty of room and a little away from the road. I love that I could walk two blocks to restaurants and cafes. The Colonial theater is about a four minute walk! I definitely recommend. I also love that Hannah left water, drinks, and a few snacks! Very thoughtful. The linens provided were very high quality. There is a huge space for yoga if you’re into that. It’s a beautiful and peaceful spot. It also has a great outdoor space to enjoy during the warm months. I definitely recommend!"

Stayed one night","can walk to numerous restaurants and things to do. wish we could have stayed longer. I have a certified service dog so when searching, this place came up under pet friendly - DO NOT BRING DOGGOS. Cleaner is allergic and very much not the vibe. if my dog didn’t stay by my side and trained i would be nervous about the decor (hence why my other dog doesn’t travel with me 😅) entirely understandable and despite the confusion, communication was breezy. There are stairs but they are well lit with cameras and not isolated. I did not feel in danger whatsoever. highly recommended to friends."

Hannah has done a remarkable job transforming this 3rd floor space into something that makes for a memorable stay. Among all the pitched architectural features are a variety of very well composed living spaces. It's walking distance to a revitalized Main Street. Enjoyed Modestman Brewing in particular. Parking was great, access easy and Hannah was an extraordinary host."

Make sure there are multiple people walking up the stairs especially late at night. It seems like a good place to be mugged. Pricey apartment for only one bed. Place was very clean and Hannah was a good host.

We traveled on Halloween weekend so the to go cups on the well supplied coffee bar were Halloween themed! There were bagels and cream cheese waiting for us in the refrigerator. There were fresh flowers over the fireplace. The linens were spa quality. Everything looked brand new in an antique house. The decor was very tasteful and fresh. The kitchen was well equipped with everything. The bathroom looked like it had just been remodeled and no one else had even used it yet. The beds were excellent. The mattresses weren't the cheap foam ones but quality all the way. The room had such great windows I didn't even know it had rained until morning. It was totally quiet all night.
Their communication was excellent. They were attentive and ready to serve. My only regret is not having enough time to meet the host. I will definitely be staying with them again."

It was by far our favorite Airbnb experience both because of the space and because Kristin and Marty are just the best. There were so many special touches that made this space feel so comfortable and more like a home away from home. Their attention to detail and kindness is unmatched. We walked downtown for dinner (with a 4 year old) and it was an easy walk so it's definitely a great location too. I really can't say enough good things about our experience here.

Keene is a wonderful town, with great bars and restaurants, and really friendly locals. Kristin and Marty were fantastic hosts, with a really cute apartment that's a short walk to the town center. The apartment truly felt like home for the couple of days we were there. It had nice little touches like fresh flowers, coffee, and welcome pastries from a local bakery. Everything was clean, the towels and linens were soft and fresh. We loved it there and look forward to returning!"

From coordinator:
They were amazing hosts! They texted us every day to see how we liked it. Also texted me that everything looked great when we left. It was clean, beautiful, and well stocked. Would stay again!
From photographer:
The place was nice, it was clean, and it was conveniently located. Natalia and I didn't meet the owners because of the odd times we were arriving and leaving, but it felt very personal - they had a welcome sign with all of our names on it, and they left some waters and some pastries, which was thoughtful. It was a very positive experience, I would stay at that place again.
Kristin and Marty were great hosts and I would definitely book this place again! Thank you so much!"

The beds were very comfy, and we especially like the Keurig coffee station.

The kitchen was stocked with delicious bagels and cheese from a local bakery, coffee, waters, etc..The place was sunny, nice breezes, quiet, and we felt very safe there.

The space was well heated with ceiling fans that will be great additions for the summer. The fridge had cream cheese for the bagels they’d left for us on the counter next to the stocked coffee maker.

It is delightful: warm and cozy, with plenty of space and beautiful structural details, and it’s a short walk into town for great meals. My friend and I were having some ‘girls’ time’ away from family and work responsibilities. The living room and desk/sitting room offer different spots for hanging out and relaxing. The space could easily accommodate two couples (2 rooms with big beds), or be a nice work retreat if someone was seeking a place to write. Everything seemed brand new, sparkling clean, and much of the space was created by hand by Marty and Kristin—a true labor of love that guests now get to enjoy. Keurig coffee available at all times; pastry treats offered our first morning; quick replies on all correspondence. Truly wonderful hosts and a wonderful getaway. It’s a quick walk into town for dinner: we particularly liked The Stage (good food and great cocktails). Hoping to run away for another weekend sometime! We’ll be sure to stay with Kristin and Marty if they aren’t booked up already."

Stayed a few nights","When we reserved a month in advance, we took a chance on a new place that didn't yet have reviews, and we are so glad we did. Kristen and Marty recently renovated the space and were friendly and welcoming. They even provided fresh bagels and cream cheese, a welcome surprise. There's a Keurig with coffee and cocoa. The kitchen had space to store our groceries and came equipped with everything we needed. We could have cooked all our meals there, but we enjoyed the half-mile walk to town to local restaurants for dinner.
The apartment was so clean and new-looking that we wondered if we were the first guests, but no, others had signed the guestbook and left glowing comments. Kristin and Marty clearly take pride in giving their guests a spotless and nicely decorated place to stay.
One warning: you do need to climb a flight of steep stairs, and since the apartment was once an attic, there are some low ceilings. My family members and I are short so this wasn't a problem, but very tall people might not prefer it.
Overall, we were delighted. If you're looking for a place in Keene, the second floor of Kristin and Marty's home makes a great apartment."

It's a really comfortable and private apartment, perfectly located within walking distance of Keene's vibrant main street, with plenty of restaurants, bars and shops nearby.
Everything in the apartment was thoughtfully laid out and stylishly finished to a very high standard. The kitchen and living areas are well equipped and spacious. The apartment could comfortably accommodate at least four people, though there were only the two of us staying.
Kristin and Marty are warm, welcoming, attentive hosts - and lovely people! They had added some great personal touches, and were very kind to be flexible for us. It was a wonderful retreat and definitely great value for money.
Cannot recommend this place enough. Thanks Kristin and Marty for a great stay!"

So many nooks full of wonderful things to discover. Comfortable seating and beds (heavenly king size mattress). Granddaughters love the studio. It’s their sanctuary when we’re there (one wants to buy the house when she grows up). Well equipped kitchen, and labeled cabinets and drawers make it so easy to find things. Dishes and glassware are pretty and fun. The unexpected extra touches throughout the house are so appreciated and add to the home away from home feeling. Nice neighborhood and close to town.

Stayed with kids","We were in Keene for a family reunion and stayed in this lovely house with both children and grandparents. The house was beautifully decorated and maintained and was really perfect for us. The kitchen had everything we could possibly need, the house was stocked with cool books and games, and our kids fell in love with the awesome loft. The layout worked well for a larger group, as it allowed people to spread out and not keep each other awake. The screened-in porch was a great place to congregate, and the first floor bedroom and bathroom were good for an older person with limited mobility. The location is excellent - an easy, flat walk 10 minute walk into downtown Keene — and the hosts could not have been nicer or more responsive. We are all hoping to stay again for the next family reunion!"

The home not only had everything we needed, but it offered the creature comforts that make choosing an AirBnB far better than staying in a hotel. I've already recommended this place to several of my friends and classmates that live in or near the area. It's too big for a couple, but perfect for a family getaway."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful house! Very clean. Extremely spacious. Well decorated. Loved the open concept. How unique and comfortable it was to have the four bedrooms, four living room/den spaces, three bathrooms, two electric fireplaces, tons of counter space, and that one could walk from end to end through the first floor, up the stairs, through the second floor and down the back stair case. We didn’t cook during this visit but we sooo appreciated the fresh, local milk in the fridge waiting to greet a house full of coffee drinkers! There as a very nice welcome basket with snacks and wine. All instructions and house guide book was clear and easy to follow. We are looking forward to a return visit in one year!!"

Stayed with kids","Ample, clean, wonderfully charming space to live in for a fall wedding nearby for all 12 of us, including 2 five year olds. The open space on the first floor was immaculate and accommodating to all of us at meal and relaxation times. Then the back room served us well for late night chats while the sleepers slept. BIG bedrooms. Really Nice furnishings throughout. So tastefully decorated throughout. All the amenities we needed and more. So much parking space (for 5-8 cars?) and two garage spots made in and out and security so easy. Beds were comfy. Lots of pillows, blankets, seats, TP, towels, etc. Lots of space / bathroom availability. Big fridge. Snacks! Coffee! Tea! Lots of stuff carefully and proactively provided. Very helpful and detailed binder.
This old farmhouse has a charm that left us all looking forward to our next visit!"

Group trip","We were in Keene for my daughters wedding in Walpole. We were 7 staying at the home and it was completely wonderful. We had a few local friends who were able to walk from their hotels, to the home, to visit after the long days. It is the perfect place for a group. Super unassuming from the street but walk in and it is perfection. Comfortable with plenty of room to spread out. We loved the outside covered seating area near the hottub. All the seating in the house was comfortable as were the beds. I am fussy where I stay when I get away from it all. All of us agree that we would run back to this home when we can. Main Street is a short walk to farmers market, coffee shops, restaurants and galleries. We already want to go back when we have more time to explore. The host was super responsive when I had a question! That is a huge plus. You will not be disappointed in this home."

The hosts thought of everything - from a welcome basket, to a high chair for our baby, to a guide on some history of their house. We loved our weekend in the home, and it’s obvious the hosts take pride in it.
One of the reasons we decided on this house is because of its prime location to downtown. It’s a very short walk to all of the restaurants, cafes, and shopping. Yet it’s still quiet and serene. The perfect location, in a beautiful home, with very accommodating and gracious hosts.
(This house even converted my parents into liking the idea of Airbnbs - they were previously very skeptical.)"

Stayed over a week","Celia's place, Heron Cove at Wilson Pond, was beautiful & very peaceful. It was an easy check-in process. Upon entering, I noticed how much bigger the inside looks from the outside. At the same time, it has a very cozy feel to it. Once we got settled, we looked for places close by that would deliver. Athen's Pizza did not disappoint. Papagallo's is another really great restaurant that's only a couple miles up the road. There were ducks that would come to visit every day, & a 2 person kayak to enjoy. I stayed there while there was a snow storm. Initially the internet went out, but it came back on later that night. Other than that, there were no problems with it. On Easter Sunday, I had a few family members over for dinner. Everyone wholeheartedly enjoyed themselves! The only thing that could have been better was the furniture. The beds are on the soft side, and the living room couch & chairs weren't very comfortable. Having the use of a washer/dryer was a major plus. I would stay again."

Convenient parking right outside front door. What to know: Streetlight keeps main bedroom from getting very dark. Second bedroom is open at ceiling to living room so sound travels. Entrance to second bedroom is at head of the bed, so need to walk very narrow path between bed and wall to get in and out. Floors between kitchen, dining room, and living room are at slightly different levels with very small ramps between each room. Had issues with wall HVAC unit in living room always blowing hot air even when set at cool, which will hopefully be resolved for next guest."

The beds were incredibly comfortable as well! We had a couple of questions when we first got there, but Celia got back to us right away. the only thing I would say is that if you are planning on watching Netflix, don't. It took forever to get logged into the system because the internet would not connect, and then it kept booting us off of the internet. Between the rebooting and the screen freezing and having to keep rewinding and restarting things, it took a couple hours of extra time the two nights we returned to watch movies in the evening. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","liked this location and would come back in the summer to use the lake. The heater made a strange burning smell that was not resolved, the heater was also very loud. I got a tect right before checking in informing me that the lock was stuck and to only use the deadbolt and i wish this was in the description of the house because i am big on security. the dishwasher was missing fluid so we had to do them by hand. over nice area and home."

Stayed with kids","Came into town for a wedding and this was the perfect little place for our group of people to stay. It’s an old home and gives you that feeling with the decor. There are quite a few stairs which could be a bit much with young children or anyone older that may not be able to handle them. But we loved the quietness even being near downtown Keene. After a bit of trouble getting into the front door with our code, the hosts were quick to help remedy and get us inside for our check in with little trouble after that. If we ever have a big family event in Keene again we will definitely want to come back here!"

Stayed with kids","10 of us came to NH for a funeral & to climb Monadnock. We arrived quite late on a weeknight and were happy with ease of entry instructions. Wifi name and password on the chalk board was a nice touch. The house was a lovely old house with modern amenities. I don't think it mentioned anywhere a simple ""4 bedrooms up, one down"". That would have been helpful. Master bed was super high up and required us old folks quite a leg-stretch to get in. All rooms were pretty, and comfy nonetheless. The sitting/fireplace area in the downstairs bedroom was a bonus. The driveway was long and wide enough to fit all our cars (guests stopped in for community and refreshments after funeral). School Street was quiet. Kids liked the swings in the back yard. Friendly/quiet dogs live next door. There were plenty of pots & pans for cooking, as well as usual kitchen dinnerware. I believe we all felt right at home. Thank you!"

Patti responded within minutes and was so kind to give us some history as well as local places to find things we needed.
We had planned to go out and explore the town but were so content and comfortable that we found ourselves just hanging out. A great place to chill.
Was also thrilled with the bed. Firm mattress was marvelous for my bad back - but soft enough for my shoulders… often a rare combo.
We will be staying here again as well as checking out Patti’s other listings. Highly recommend!"

The place was perfect for us. The home was big enough that we could each have a separate working area and even be in Zoom meetings at the same time and not disturb each other. Internet was great and we never had any glitches in Zoom video calls.
Patti was amazingly responsive and responded within a few minutes each time we contacted her.
The location of the Art Gallery in Keene is great. I do a lot of ""walk and talk"" one-on-one meetings at work and found some great places to walk around the neighborhood. The home is also close to downtown Keene and we could walk to everything we needed (we drove to the grocery store) - we recommend the Prime Roast for coffee and Brewbakers for a legit donut/baked goods (the everything scone!). Parking was easy and the home itself is off the main streets a bit so it was very quiet.
We had a great visit!"

Stayed a few nights","We can't recommend this apartment enough! The location was perfect to explore Keene and New Hampshire, it was spotlessly clean and it had everything that we could have asked for. A few things that really made this apartment stand out (apart from the books!) were the great shower, the comfortable beds and the user friendly kitchen. 10/10 would recommend to anyone."

The little house is located just a short drive away from main street in Keene. Julie is an excellent host and very respectful and responsive. If I need to stay in Keene again for work, this will be it. I'm not a fan of the plain Jane hotel scene. I'd prefer my own house for the same price."

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed my stay in Keene. Communication with Patti was excellent and check in was seamless and flexible. The suite was accurately described. Its an older structure and has its quirks but that is part of the charm. If you stay in an older home you should expect some unique features and yes, some squeaks! Exterior definitely shows its age but like they say about judging books by their covers don't be concened - the interior is in good shape. The decor was interesting as well - notice the wall hangings/maps and photos as they capture something about the area! The proximity to the downtown is wonderful. The downtown is simply a gem of a New England village. I recommend the Thai Garden restaurant and Prime Roast is a wonderful local coffee shop. Surrounding areas are beautiful as well and readily accessed from this location. I worked most of the day during my stay and had no issues with WiFi or other disruptions. The overall cleanliness of the suite was very good. Bathrooms and kitchens are key for me and both were spotless! Overall I tend to look at value as the bottom line. In the end I feel the rate was very fair given all the suite and location have to offer!!"

Nice to have easily accessible free parking, as well. The apartment is in an historic building so things are just older (wonky floors, doors don’t always close easily), but everything is appointed well and very clean. Laundry is shared between other units, but it is free. The only negative part of our experience was there was a mouse found in the garbage can upon arrival. The host was gracious and apologized and promised to address it right away. Great customer service. The unit was exceptionally clean and it appeared to just be an isolated one-off of being in an older building. Overall - very good stay. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay mirrored pretty much what others have written. Pros: great location if Keene and the region is your target. Clean. And I’d add great parking. Cons: the house could use some love inside and out - though that didn’t affect our stay in any super tangible way. The bed situation is tough. You have to like firm beds to get a good night sleep. and the third “bed” is a small folding couch. It’s somewhere between 4x4 when folded open. Maybe 5x5 at most. So only good for one child, not two. Definitely not adults (unless they are uncommonly wee). If you have an appreciation for wall art, this is the place for you! Wish we had more time to explore all the books."

Stayed a few nights","We feel compelled to post a few problems we had with the Airbnb though it is quite cute and well-located. The problems we had: 1) the final night of our stay the heat was on so high and unable to be turned off that we had to leave in the middle of the night because we were unable to sleep and literally drenched in sweat (though we opened all the windows to try to cool it down); 2) there was an old sharp nail sticking up from the wood floor near the kitchen which almost seriously cut my foot; 3) the front door lock was almost unworkable to the point that only my husband was able to get the key to work after many tries; 4) the center stair chandelier light switch didn’t work so the light always stayed on and we had to unscrew the light bulbs to shut it off at night; 5) we weren’t able to get in contact with the Host during our stay to get these things fixed. Like we said, the place is cute and well-located, so we hope the Host will fix those problems for future Guests."

The house is 1910 meets 1980s updates, with some holdover appliance colors from the 60s, and the art that vies for wall space will have you skipping from Picasso to Abe Lincoln to Japanese ducks. This all comes together in a crazy clash that means you’ll have something to look at everywhere you go. 😁 If you’re into ghosts, you’ll find a quiet presence to sit with in the south bedroom. Thanks for the stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The inside of the apartment is nice enough, but the outside is suffering from some neglect. I think the most important thing at an Airbnb are the beds, and these were not great. Nor were the pillows. The kitchen could have used some better supplies as there weren’t even 2 regular wine glasses. The location was good and we walked pretty much everywhere in Keene. If memory serves, the door will automatically lock, so do NOT shut it unless you have the key.
Bedding and kitchen upgrades would have bumped up my rating."

The linens were nice, and all of the rooms are well sized. Something you can’t tell from the pictures is that the entrance truly is private. The doors on the ground floor that once opened to the first floor rooms are completely sealed off, so it feels private and safe during Covid. The front patio would be a great place to sit on a warm day. It’s located on a prime street with many classic houses. It felt like a treat to stay there. I’m always happy when an Airbnb includes a library of books, and this one does."

We felt that it was very clean and met our expectations for COVID-19 sanitation. We did quite a bit of cooking, and found the kitchen to be adequate. There were a few staples stocked in the kitchen. The apartment is located well for walking downtown. Parking was also convenient. The only downside is that it is an older building, which looks like it could use some exterior maintenance; however that did not interfere with the quality of our stay. We would definitely recommend Patti's place."

Stayed a few nights","Patti’s spacious apartment is conveniently located within walking distance of Keene’s Central Square, which includes restaurants, shops, a church and movie/events theater. The Phineas Handerson House appears to be historic, with various additions to the property, which is currently divided into 5 apartments. Her place is accessed by going up a few steps at the front of the building, through her own private entrance foyer and up rather steep carpeted stairs to the second floor. The apartment is chicly furnished with antiques and interesting pieces with tasteful eclectic art and prints on the walls. Patti is a gracious host who provides a variety of thoughtful amenities (grab bar in tub/shower, wall magnifying mirror and counter top mirror in bath, good towels and bedding, an extensive book/reading collection, basic kitchen supplies and equipment and plentiful paper goods to name a few). Bedrooms are large and beds comfortable. Patti provided good communication. Free daytime parking on the street in front made unloading and repacking easy. Specific overnight parking spaces are available to guests directly behind the property. We enjoyed our brief stay in cozy comfort while exploring a bit of Keene and sampling some great food (Thai Garden, The Stage Restaurant, Luca’s Mediterranean) and would happily choose this airbnb for a future visit!"

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our 4-night stay at The Phineas Handerson House over the Christmas holidays. We were already familiar with Keene, having visited the area many times in the past, but we had never stayed in an AirBNB. The house is within walking distance to downtown and has a convenient parking area behind it off a side street.
The photos of the accommodations are accurate. There is ample space to move around in all of the rooms. There were only three of us, but it would have been just as comfortable for four people. (We did not test the sofa bed in the TV/sitting room, so I cannot vouch for or against it.)
The linens and pillows on the beds were very inviting and the mattresses were comfortable for sleeping. The towels in the bathroom were plush and cozy. The shower is quite high, which would be great for tall people, and there is a long, deep bathtub, which seemed like it would be ideal to soak in.
The kitchen was well stocked with plenty of glasses, dishes, silverware and cookware, as well as a coffee maker, a toaster, a microwave and a full size refrigerator. There was even a dishwasher, although we didn't use it.
The wi-fi access was secure, strong and simple to connect to. The rooms were very clean and all of the amenities were quite useful to us during our visit. We would not hesitate to stay here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We found the place very easily, as it was on a main road. The instructions on where our place was was spot on as well as instructions to get to our apt in the building. The place was immaculate and just as described, and Shane even provided some snacks and waters. I would stay at the house again most definately, but would pick a different apt at the house/location. The only reason for this is our apt was at the front of the house on a main road that seems to be on a truck route, so it did get a little loud sometimes with the passing traffic. This is not a reflection on the host or the cleanliness and coziness of the apt."

Stayed a few nights","I very much enjoyed my stay at The Murdock Suite, located in the big house. The house was well maintained and very clean. There is ample space for six people. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking, which I did take advantage of.
Plenty of towels in the bathroom, which were the big thick kind to dry off with. The shower had plenty of hot water and was easy to get of. The beds were super comfortable and the pillows were great to bury your head in.
the only drawback, is , if you're not used to traffic this might be loud to you. The house is adjacent to a heavily used road during the day, it does get quiet at night, but you can hear them up until around 900 PM.
Other than that , the house is defiantly worth staying at. The shared patio has tables and a gas stove to cook, with plenty of room, for a feast. The downtown area is a stone throw away, and worth a trip.
I enjoyed this Airbnb stay and would stay here again !"

Big, spacious, comfy and such a complete kitchen, felt like being in a lovely warm house more than being in a hotel. really loved it. Big fridge, comfy beds, extra blankets, soft pillows, well stocked bathroom, lovely and clean. The only thing I wish it had….. I’m short… so the shower head was so high up!!! Wish it had a shower that was height adjustable- but that’s me being a shortie not anything to do with the accommodation. Fast internet- great contact, clear instructions, def a 5 star stay. Well done Shane on offering such a lovely place for visitors- thank you so much for being so excellent ❤️❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay at the Burrell House. Details of the stay were provided right after booking, and hosts were very responsive (including when I needed to check in a bit early).
The room was beautiful! Huge comfortable bed, super soft linens, great bathroom amenities as well. If you’re someone who loves baths but doesn’t have one at home, make use of the bathtub and bring some bath bombs :) good water pressure, nice and hot too.
Walls were a bit thin, but nothing that detracted from the stay. I just used a white noise machine and that did the trick.
I felt secure with the multiple locked points of entry. Keene is super walkable, and this location was perfect, as it is steps from downtown!
Highly recommend!"

Next, the check-in process was simple but if you book rooms 7 or 8 be aware that the steps leading to those rooms are very steep! It takes a little bit of maneuvering to get your luggage up. But it’s certainly not a deal breaker. Lastly, the home has great historic character and thoughtful details like coffee and bottled water. The location is perfect. We will definitely stay here again!!"

Stayed a few nights","We travel to Keene often to see friends and former coworkers, and typically put up with the cookie-cutter hotels that are obscenely overpriced. We were so thrilled when we found The Burrell House.
First, the spaces are so charming and comfortable. The two rooms we ended up utilizing were clean, spacious, and had their own A/C window units that cooled the space down remarkably well on such hot and humid days.
Second, you can tell Josh takes great pride in his property, and maintains it meticulously, inside and out. The attention to detail was amazing, from the lavender-scented bags in the bathroom and bedroom, to the retro appliances in each room, and the thoughtful amenities provided (a little tray of ice made for us in the freezer when we arrived, a full trash can instead of those dinky little ones, etc.). The rooms are beautiful and have so much character, and everything inside feels purposeful and perfectly in place.
Lastly, you cannot beat the service. We ended up extending our stay and requiring some specific accommodations in order to get ready for our engagement photos. Josh was responsive, professional, and so helpful. We messaged via AirBnB, he called with updates and answers to our questions/needs, and when we ran into him in person, he was very personable. He even suggested a way to save us a few dollars when we needed to extend our stay.
Long story short, we spent three nights for around what one would have been in a hotel on Main Street, and enjoyed it immeasurably more. Better price, quality, and service for a great location that's historic and beautiful. We don't have enough good things to say about The Burrell House and its employees."

One stated there was no parking on the street or you would be ticketed, so I was told to park in the drive way which was one lane, and required that I leave my car keys in the hallway in case someone needed to move my car. Also, stated in her rules that she reserves the right to enter the apt when guest is not home to adjust the thermostat. There was only a slide lock on the apt door for security which was loose and difficult to use. I immediately packed up and left feeling very uncomfortable with the whole situation."

Stayed a few nights","This is my second time at Vivian's. It's a nice top floor flat you access by entering through the house. It has lots of amenities-- coffee and tea, cooking equipment, fridge, etc. It's walkable to downtown with several local neighborhood stores nearby, and there's a super tasty BBQ place around the corner, too! The neighborhood is quiet, and if you're a walker, not too far from a conservation area about a mile north. The only thing I'd change is the mattress; it's not very supportive, but it suffices, and everything else is great!"

I texted her about it and she told me where a space heater was and also how to work the heat in the apartment. It is a great place for singles and couples without children. Their were a few appliances, like a crock pot, in the kitchen for longer stays. A drip coffee maker is there along with a flavored coffee and a dark roast. She even had a variety of board games available! Keene is a nice town with several restaurants. We would stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","I really enjoyed my time in Keene at Lynda’s Suite. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The area was lovely and I felt safe. It was a real bonus that my dog Daisy was able to join me. My favorite part was that it was such a short walking distance to Main Street, which is really terrific. Such a great variety; shops, food, and entertainment. And everyone that I met was quite friendly. Would definitely stay again. The only thing I would point out is that there are stairs that might be difficult for someone that has physical limitations."

Stayed a few nights","We didn’t see a house number at first we were about to turn around on Union Street and realized that was the way to where Patti said to park behind the house. Easy access to locate key and get inside. Although we knew about the steep stairs, as seniors they are not our friends and will look for first floor units in the futures. We did appreciate the cleanliness of the apartment and the convenient location, close to quaint town of Keene. We would stay at another of Patti’s places."

Stayed about a week","Adorable unit with amazing art that I know has personal meaning to Patti’s family. Lovely original wood floors in living room, hallway, and bedroom; great character everywhere. Kitchen setup makes fantastic use of a smaller space and is very well-stocked. Window air conditioners worked great. Patti and crew were very responsive and helpful at all times. This is a great value for the price. This is not a criticism, as it is well-documented in the property description, but the stairs are quite steep and not easy to navigate with larger luggage, so it would be wise to pack two or three smaller bags than one large one. Many thanks, Patti!"

There is also a largish park nearby to walk dogs - it runs a few miles alongside the river. It’s not fancy- basic and simple, but with amenities such as shampoo, coffee, spices. The price is exactly right for what the space offers."

Stayed a few nights","There were pros and cons to this place.
Pros: it was very clean and the A/C units kept it nice and cool, even in July. The location was perfect, only a 5-minute walk to the square in Keene. And there were 4 pillows on the bed, each a different kind and ranging from firm to soft, so you could pick which worked best for you.
Cons: the Wi-Fi kept going in and out, the mattress was very firm and not all that comfortable, the couch didn’t have any throw pillows or anything so it wasn’t comfortable to lounge on, there were ants in the kitchen, and there was no floor-length mirror, or any mirror that showed more than my head and shoulders. I couldn’t see any outfit I put on until I got into town and saw my reflection in a storefront window.
All in all, this place probably would have been fine for a night or two, but I was there for a week, and it wasn’t comfortable enough for that long."

The only thing I'd note is the unit is on the 2nd floor and the stairs are a bit steep and narrow so if you're someone who can't climb stairs well, it may be a challenge. It appears she has other units on the ground level, though!
All in all a wonderful stay!"

Stayed over a week","This is a very nice place in a good, quiet neighborhood near downtown (walking distance). The apartment was clean when we got there and check in was easy. There's a parking lot in the back that you can park in so that's great, especially when we came back late to the apartment from working and there was still a space to park. The laundry is included, it's a dryer and washer and there's laundry supplies as well if you forget anything so that's nice too. The number one thing for us was being able to telework and we were able to do that, just connected our ethernet cables and good to go. So anyone can easily telework here. There's a place called Country life vegetarian that was delicious (open Mon-Thur, 11am-3pm) they make their own vegan food (pizza is on Wednesday, don't miss it!) and have other things to buy (body care supplies, healthy food ingredients, etc.), Farm Cafe was good too, their deserts were delicious (try the cookies!), also Archway Farm is a farmstand (self serve store) that has farm meat,seafood, bread, etc. (depending on the day) and yummy healthy homemade popsicles and the monadnock food co-op grocery store has a lot of options and you can order food & smoothies. We went to Robin hood park (near downtown) for just a few minutes but it has good walking trails, children's playground and a pretty pond to look at if you don't feel like walking. The host Patti was very helpful, easy to approach, answered all my questions and so pleasant to speak with. Overall this was a great stay and if I could I would stay here again. Thanks Patti!"

There was coffee, nearly every coffee maker you could hope for, great kitchen utensils, spare bathroom essentials if you forgot something, ac for those hot summer nights, super safe parking and my list could go on.

Location is perfect, very clean, laundry was handy, etc. Unfortunately, we had an infant and the insanely creaky floors and doors woke him up so many times. It also says that the bedroom has a queen but it seemed more like a double (I could be wrong but we have one at home and my partner had to sleep on the couch while I took the bed with my son). Whatever size bed it was, it felt like sleeping on a a wooden plank and I'm still hurting from it."

Apartment is in an older building but the apartment has nice renovations and a cool vibe to the art and decor inside. Quiet area which is also nice. The kitchen was lacking some things which may have been due to previous renters taking items- no full set of eating utensils, no frying pan or toaster which is what most living spaces have. It did meet most of our basic needs though. The bed in the apartment was uncomfortable and left us with sore backs. The sofa was more comfortable. Overall, it was a nice stay and Patti is very responsive. We would consider renting again."

Bed was great, cable tv was awesome, and other than a few tiny issues, it was a great space. Super tiny issues: only one plug in the bedroom means we both couldnt charge our phones at night at the same time in the bedroom, only one plug also means the a/c has to face the bed directly which sucked; and we're a bit sensitive to smells so the glade plug-ins all over the apt were a little overwhelming so we unplugged them all during our stay (we recognize this isnt an issue for most people). overall, enjoyed our stay and it was bigger, cleaner, and nicer than anything else we saw in the area."

Stayed a few nights","The place was certainly very clean and the kitchen/bedroom are quite nice. It was a little hot, the AC is ok but if you want fresh air the windows are older and only a few open well. You also might want to bring some more dishware such as pots and pans as the plates and bowls are melamine, so bringing paper disposable is a good idea if you're wary of that kind of thing. And don't leave slightly late it gets in the way of the next cleaning. Hope you have fun in NH!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a large, lovely apartment for someone who can do without a kitchen--although there is a little kitchen table in the living-dining room, and a microwave and coffee and tea and a cabinet with dishware--and lots of little treats. This room and the bedroom are quite spacious and simply and tastefully decorated. The bathroom is a decent size, too, and it and the rest of the house have an amazing amount of storage, should you need that. Beautiful old house with wide floorboards--that somehow don't creak at all underfoot. Nice sofa with lamps on both ends--and the bed has the same, which, as avid readers, we greatly appreciated. We felt very much at home in this house and will absolutely stay there again when we're in the area. One warning: the steps up to the apartment are steep and the treadles are not very deep, so you need to take your time going up and down."

There are 2 rooms (one bedroom and 1 with a sofa bed) and there is a breakfast nook in the other room where the host generously provides all sorts of coffee, teas and snacks. The place had everything one would need. The checkout was super easy. Totally recommend! We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a charming, cozy little one bedroom with an ""attic apartment"" type of feel. The steps are a little narrow and steep, might not be for an older guest or one with some mobility issues. The bathroom is spacious. I wasn't clear how many other units might be in the house, and whether guests were staying there, so I was a little hesitant to do my morning exercise routine on the older wood floors, not wanting to wake someone up early in the morning. I did it very quietly. There is a cute little kitchen area with a microwave and generous snacks, but a little dish detergent, kithen towel, and sponge for the bathroom sink might have helped for washing tea cups, spoons, and bowls. Overall I felt very comfortable there, and appreciate the super clean bathroom. Not too fancy, but just enough and just right!"

The location is just a few minutes away from several stores while also being tucked away in a quiet area. The upstairs apartment was tidy and tremendously comfortable. Padma’s home was stocked with complimentary snacks and kitchen supplies. These came in handy and mirrored the convenience of a hotel room, lacking a kitchen but well equipped with coffee, tea, a microwave, coffee maker and electric kettle. We hope to visit NH again soon.

Stayed a few nights","The location was perfect for the training I was attending. It's also not far from town and a local park. We enjoyed our time there, but do think it would be best for short stays vs. the 7 days we were there. With no way to cook or wash dishes, it made it a bit challenging (personally not fans of washing dishes in the bathroom, but I suppose you could). The bowl of treats/snacks as well as coffee, tea, and a pitcher of filtered water were very much appreciated upon arrival. There is no TV, which I guess I didn't notice in the listing, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Decks of cards or more games would have been helpful to pass the time in the evenings so recommend bringing your own. We ended up buying cards to keep us busy.
It was relatively quiet and the bed was comfy. No problems sleeping for us! It is a lovely space to use as a home-base for exploring the area."

Better than any local hotel as far as I've experienced."

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect stay for my husband and I. It has a private entrance and staircase that leads up to an adorable set of rooms on the second floor. There's more than enough space for two people. The rooms were CLEAN. I couldn't find a speck of dust or grime anywhere. The amenities left included coffee, a Keurig, and even yogurt in a mini fridge. The heat was easy to adjust for comfort, and the shower had plenty of soaps and shampoos. The bed was comfortable, even though it sank a smidge in the middle, and the dark curtains allowed us to either keep the room dark or let in the readily available natural light. It was also quiet, allowing us to recharge after a long day. The energy was great as well. We were both very comfortable in the old house, and hope to return in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We chose to stay in Keene in order to have relatively easy access to Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for the Fall foliage. We made a good choice as Padma’s place proved to be convenient for our journey. This is a good place if you want to enjoy quiet and peaceful surroundings while still being a 5 minute drive away from downtown Keene."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent spot for the quirky, random town that is Keene. I was here for a disc golf tournament/vacation, and the place suited me perfectly. It certainly has a lot of character - vintage and charming. The A/C units in each room were nice and bed was comfortable. I enjoyed the tub as well. No TV, so I brought my laptop and streamed Netflix/Amazon. I would stay here again if visiting Keene."

I would definitely stay there again. Hopefully, next year!
Thank you Padma"

Stayed a few nights","Liane was our contact person and was very responsive , friendly and helpful. The apt was spacious, quiet and a great location to the Keene downtown area. The ONLY downside is if you want a meal in the apt., the kitchenette has no sink/running water, but this was not a deal-breaker for us. great accommodations, great hosts, great location!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a pleasant place to stay with easy access to town and easy access to a park that you can walk in. Literally the park is a 2 to 3 minute walk and downtown is a 5 to 10 minute walk. Everything is clean easy check in, quiet and a very enjoyable stay. I plan to stay here again if it’s available when I come back."

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean, well stocked and very tastefully decorated. The hostess communicated well, was unobtrusive and things were as described. The antiques, somewhat steep stairs and wide-planked floors give this a definite old (yet modern) New England feel.
At one point, in my head, I described the place as a bit quirky, but after visiting the home of friend in Keene, I realized that this place was Keene Quirky, which is almost exactly the reason for using AirBnB. This is an experience and not just a place to stay.
For us, it was a very pleasant experience."
