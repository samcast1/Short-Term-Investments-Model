The house was immaculate and it had everything as advertised in the listing. She took the time to provide any little extras that we may have forgotten, such as shampoo, toothpaste, etc. She responded within 15 minutes of me booking the property and all other communication was in a timely manner. Should we decide to head back to that area, we would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I recently had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb, and I couldn't be happier with my experience! The house was just as described in the listing – cozy, comfortable, and well-maintained. Everything was spotlessly clean.
The location couldn't have been more perfect! Approx 10 min to Mohegan and 20ish to Foxwoods and Mystic. Great jumping point.
Hassle-free check-in/out. The host was incredibly proactive in their communication, providing all the necessary details well in advance. This made me feel welcomed and ensured I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay to the fullest.
Would 100% stay again."

Stayed a few nights","We booked this property for a girl's weekend and it exceeded our expectations. It was very clean and neat. It was exactly as described, but much better in person. It was close to everywhere we wanted to go and in a very quiet neighborhood. Because we had quite a bit of rain we weren't able to enjoy the deck as much as we wanted, but what time we did spend out there was great. The view was wonderful. I didn't have many questions, but when I did reach out, the response time was immediate. We would recommend this property to anyone visiting this area and look forward to going back in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We were up in Mohegan Sun for a volleyball tournament. The location was so super easy…from parking right outside of the villa to the ride being so easy and only like 3 mins from the tournament/casino. The unit was clean, the linens were clean and even the grout in the shower was all clean. I asked if we could have some extra towels and our host graciously gave them. And also let us check out a little later than the checkout time which worked so well for us. We definitely plan to return if we are back up there in the future!"

There is a hot tub with pool very close to the villa and we took advantage of these restful facilities as often as we could. Everything at this stay was absolutely great and the host is truly amazing. He responds within minutes, is very proactive and attentive. This entire stay was a pleasure. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights",My boyfriend and I chose the villa on the grounds of the Spa and Norwich Inn to celebrate his birthday and have easy access to both the Mohegan Sun casino and the spa and pools. The place is just as described and in the photos. It is so beautifully appointed and felt like a special oasis away with a fresh air balcony that was so peaceful overlooking thick woods. I booked this place the evening before our arrival and Future LPC responded right away ..welcoming us to the property and there was nothing found missing when we checked in. The place was spotless clean and having a fully equipped kitchen was so handy in making easy breakfasts and coffee/tea in the morning! When I requested an extra set of towels the response was warm and friendly and they were dropped off at our door later that day. Overall I feel this place made us feel so welcomed and my boyfriend was at the casino in 5 mins and me at the pool also in 5 mins. Stay here and have a lovely escape!

Stayed a few nights","I loved it here, but their needs to be bug traps and the balcony needs to be cleaned there’s spider webs and tons of crap on the chairs. I love the bed and the shower and I love that their was coffee in the fridge Colombian the real deal. I love the key pad to get in. The pad is very cute and smart It talks when you don’t close the door all the way, which is pretty cool. Loved the Calvin Klein pillow and the way the bed was framed and set up. I definitely would stay here again if there were bug traps and automatic bug sprays that sprayed bug repellent."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, we enjoyed our stay here! The only complaint that I have is this is NOT an “entire home” as listed on Airbnb. We had downstairs guests making noise during quiet hours as well as taking all of the parking spots. (These are supposed to be divided between the two units.) The hosts makes the rules of the location very clear, however, it can be hard to actually control the guests. If this location were properly listed as a two bedroom apartment I would have 0 complaints!
The rooms are tidy and free of clutter. Getting in and out was easy enough with the electronic locks. There is a staircase up to the unit, so we tried our hardest to stay quiet and not disturb the other guests downstairs. Mohegan sun is SO CLOSE and Foxwoods is only about 18 minutes away. It is a convenient location for a calm weekend getaway. We also went to mystic aquarium which is only a short drive away.
When I filter my airbnb search to be only ""Entire Homes"" this is not what I'm searching for."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I on a whim decided to use Airbnb for the first time and book a house close to the casinos for a little getaway. The house was immaculate and so cute! I was concerned that the bed was going to be too small since we have a king bed at home, but without two dogs sharing it, it was perfect sized for us! The instructions were clear and posted in key places to let us know all the important information we would need. We spent a lot of time at the kitchen table playing games because we lost a lot of money the first day at the casino, ha ha. I would agree with another reviewer that the couch wasn’t super comfortable, but we still enjoyed watching shows in the living room. Communication was excellent as Daniel checked in with us a couple of times to make sure things were going as well as they could. the place had all the amenities you would want, and you could tell many upgrades were done. I hope any future Airbnb experiences I have go just as smoothly. Thanks Daniel!"

This place fit the bill - reasonably priced, clean, nice neighborhood, peaceful and cozy. The host communicated clearly about check-in, amenities, and local dining spots. Place was as pictured and was nicely appointed with the things a traveler might need - shampoo, hair dryer, towels, coffee/tea, kitchen utensils, dishes, and flatware. It truly felt like a home away from home and was spacious, yet cozy. I had injured my knee so steep steps were a little challenging with my luggage. Other than that, I would definitely stay here again!"

The space is clean and very efficiently furnished. Everything that you need is there. I wish the main bedroom would’ve had a bigger bed, it had plenty of room for it, why not put a king size bed in it? Something to consider down the road!
Daniel the host is very friendly, proactive, and accommodating. He checked with us on several occasions to see if we needed anything. Instructions for check-in and checkout are very clear and easy to manage. I would consider staying here again in the future on my next trip to Norwich."

Stayed about a week","After our first day Daniel had asked how things were going and if we needed anything. Things were going very well, but I had recommended a shower caddy for future guests as the shower had nowhere to place shampoo and soap. Within 10 minutes Daniel had responded saying that he ordered a caddy and it would be there the day after next. This was perfect since we were staying a whole week. The caddy arrived on schedule and was installed in the shower and put to use. To me, this is what going above and beyond as a host looks like, in addition to the cleanliness of the house and Daniel’s care and concern for his guests. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area. Thank you for everything, Daniel!"

The only thing I didn't really like is that the stairs leading up to the second floor (Unit B) are unusually steep. Not a problem unless someone has a mobility issue, but if you do I would recommend that you ask specifically if you can stay in Unit A, which is on the ground floor."

There were plenty of towels in the bathroom, extra pillows and linens, etc. We wish we would have had more downtime to use the games and the pool, but unfortunately had a busy schedule off site… however, I did get to use the sauna and that was nice.

It is also situated on a great golf course, walk right out to the 16th tee. Other food and entertainment is only minutes away. It is far more budget friendlier than some similar places in the same complex. The communication was excellent and checkin was a breeze. Would consider staying again the next time I am in the area."

The bed was sooooooo comfy. We slept great both nights.
Staying at this cute place was both a better value than typical hotel rooms, and it was just so home-y. We loved the couples card game, too.
The little deck would be nice in warmer weather, I'm sure.
We would absolutely come back here. Go ahead and book it. You won't be disappointed.

Stayed one night","We absolutely loved our stay at Peaceful Oasis! The villa is super clean and beautifully decorated. There are so many nice touches that make this AirBnb stand out above the rest like snacks, water bottles, wine, a wide assortment of toiletries, games, and books. The hosts are very communicative, friendly, and responsive. Peaceful Oasis is great if you’re looking for a quiet getaway or if you are looking to visit the nearby casinos- Mohegan Sun is literally right up the block and Foxwoods is 18 minutes away. Mystic is also about 20 minutes away, so this was the perfect location for a weekend trip. We hope to stay here again in the future."

Stayed one night","I went there for a one-night event at Mohegan Sun and the place was convenient and beautifully equipped. The host had some unexpected touches of a bottle of wine and chocolates on a breakfast tray on the bed. (My buddies and I had a nice laugh about it, since we just hoped for nice place to stay after the MMA event, not a romantic evening :)
But in the future, I would certainly consider it as a nice romantic escape! The place was perfect for weekend trip and I will consider it again during the summer, spring or fall. We came there on the eve of a big snow storm, but enjoyed popcorn and wine after the event. Little touches like the tooth-pick/floss sticks and the Lindt chocolates and other munchies made it feel like home.
Chrissy was a super-responsive host and our stay was great!"

Christina does a great job with all the little things - coffee/sugar/creamer in the kitchen, snacks and a bottle of wine, and in the bathroom there are toothbrushes/toothpaste and soap items in case you forgot anything.
There are a bunch of games to play while relaxing in the living room enjoying a glass of wine, as well.

Neatly placed stack of menu's for local restaurants was helpful. Try Emily's for breakfast food was fresh and service good. Our bed was super comfortable and grounds well kept,quiet and felt safe ,furniture was modern and spotless & all the appliances appeared new, nothing like a nice iron and ironboard if you need it. Very short ride maybe 5 minutes to the casino. Last but not least the front door lock was very easy to operate, when they are not it can be frustrating. Now the bad ,we could only stay for the weekend🙂. Definitely deserves to be called a Super Host"

She even had a basket of books to read and games for children and adults. Her villa was clean and very welcoming with nice little decor signs, and beautiful floral arrangements. The king size bed was as comfortable as my bed at home with very comfortable pillows and beautiful accent pillows and a comforter. The bathroom had plenty of shampoo, nice soaps, etc. even extra toothbrushes in case someone forgot theirs!!

We were minutes to the event and the townhouse was neat, clean and comfortable. Christina made it extra special by leaving out goodies for us when we arrived. The grounds are beautiful and it was a quiet spot to rest and relax! We will definitely book again!"

Our Uber to Mohegan Sun was so quick and easy it’s barely memorable, but of course that’s so important to know! When we got back and finally got 3 or 4 hours of sleep, the bed was so comfortable we woke up refreshed and ready to start the day. It’s a beautiful oasis. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area, especially if you are looking for something near the casino. Our only regret is we did not plan enough time to check out the amenities. Next time!! The hosts helped us immediately when we had a question, and are super kind but not pushy. Love love love it!"

It was small, but two people can stay there easily. The laundry building is close by, if you need it. Both the living room furniture and the king-size bed were very comfortable. I’ll definitely check on availability when I’m in the area again. Many thanks to my hosts!"

The place had all the little things you don’t remember to bring, like makeup remover wipes, k cups, bottled water, plenty of bath related items. The host was awesome and even left a personalized note for us, as we were there for my husband’s birthday. Very nice to have that extra thought put in. The only negative is due to the way my gps brought us, which was to the opposite end of this community area where we needed a code to get in (which we didn’t have). Definitely take a moment and make sure your gps brings you the route that is listed in the directions of how to get there in the listing. Overall, perfect little place and would absolutely stay there again if going to Mohegan Sun for anything in the future."

Must have showed up right after a couple extra rainy days because everything seemed a little damp at first - but we were able to open the deck door & living room window & got it aired out ok.
Amenities were spot on from water filter & coffee, popcorn (& butter!) to extra pillows/blankets & toiletries.
A lot more room than a hotel for about the same price."

My only needs improvement feedback would be :
Provide filter water for Keurig, for the price - there should have been a duralog included for working fireplace ( I paid extra for mine and some of the neighboring bnb’s had at least 1 as a courtesy for fireplace ) , and lastly -for guests like me who clean up after myself , I would say they could have been more flexible with checkout ( I asked for 15 min extra but was denied ) .
All that said- Ada and Brian were very nice hosts and we would stay again ."

Ada’s space was very relaxing, with a working fireplace, a king sized bed with weighted blanket, and a tub big enough to take a bubble bath. I utilized the spa on site as well and I loved the privacy that Ada’s condo provided but still was able to use the spa facilities.

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for a funeral and staying at Nates place gave us one less thing to worry about. super clean, very well equipped, and a great setup for me and my dad as it had 2 bathrooms. Beds very comfortable, including the Murphy bed. the balcony is a very nice place for morning coffee-- overlooks the creek.
it's a quiet area, but the Norwich Inn is right up the hill and has a nice restaurant and tavern (Wednesday is trivia night). I didn't get to try out the fitness center and pool but they are right across the parking lot, so great for families.
also it literally costs HALF of what two rooms at the inn cost. The best option in the area, for sure."

Stayed a few nights","Hi Nate
Your place is so lovely!
We really enjoyed staying here and we hosted our son and his girlfriend and her 2 family members for a steak dinner . The kitchen is fully stocked for putting on a dinner party which was great.
Took us a minute to find the jacuzzi! We went to the first pool you pass by & didn’t find the jacuzzi there .
Haha but the indoor jacuzzy was fabulous last night my husband got in the pool said it was heated I did not and we stayed as late as we wanted to, the security told us to lock up when we left!
Really enjoyed the balcony with the water fountain and little bridges.
We went to Manhattan yesterday so it was nice to soak .
It’s been a great trip .
We love the super comfortable bed. Nice touch
Thanks for having us.
When we come to see our son at college again we will book with you .
Only one suggestion …. A taller table and chairs on the balcony so you can see the amazing view better , the rail blocks it .
We didn’t get to try the spa or the restaurant we had too much on our plate planned with our sons girlfriend.
We will be back next time we are in town . Thanks again !"

I picked it because of the updated decor the couch was stained and damp it also reeked of urine the hot water did not last more then 10 mins if I was lucky. I could not turn the heat up the villa was cold throughout my stay.the tub was also dirty it had this gray Tint like a ring around it.I had to buy bleach and a brush before I even thought about stepping In.The refrigerator was old/out dated and could use a good cleaning as well.other then that my stay was pleasant Great location to shop .The villa was also stocked with extra blankets,Towels and washcloths.I went to the spa and got a deep tissue massage that I did enjoy.

There was coffee and sugar already there for the keurig, and there were blankets and pillows to snuggle on the couch. We enjoyed coffee on the balcony each morning, and loved having two bathrooms (his and hers!). We were also close to wineries and Mohegan Sun- and eve spent the day in Mystic. Highly recommend this place!"

The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. The Murphy bed was a nice addition. There are two nice size bathrooms and that made it so easy for two women to get ready. We also took advantage of the spa on the last day of our trip and it was fabulous. It is an upstairs unit so be aware if you have lots of luggage you will have to carry it up stairs.

Stayed a few nights","Nate’s place is clean, comfortable, and stylish. We spent two nights at Nate’s place with a pretty busy agenda which included a day at the spa, catching a concert at the casino, and also doing some work on our computers from The villa. The Wi-Fi was fine.. no issues with being able to work for a few hours. Nate‘s place is very close to the casino. We chose to Uber and it was only $10 each way. Nates villa is super quiet and even has a small deck to sit outside privately overlooking a little pond. The queen bed upstairs was exceptionally comfortable There were plenty of supplies of pillows, towels, Etc. The kitchen was well stocked. Although we didn’t cook, it seems that you wouldn’t need to bring much of anything as everything is provided. there are stairs to get into the Villa as well as a short flight of stairs to get up to the bedroom., but everything is well lit with hand rails and easily accessible. I will definitely return and encourage others to take advantage of Nate’s Villa"

Checkout Relaxation room and all of the spa amenities.
Loved the sky lights that we woke up-to each morning...blue skies, rain& sunshine...didn’t need the weather channel.
Loved the terrace to catch a brisk breath of fresh air. Pretty view of the Villas, creek & a little bit of nature to sip my wine to.

Stayed a few nights","This was our first AirBnB experience so I have nothing to compare it to except hotels or inns. I will just give my observations and you can decide what is important to you.
The place was mostly clean and very stylish. It could use some minor repairs throughout (caulking, fix the downstairs toilet seat, fix screen sliding door on balcony). The biggest issue we had was hot water. The first night we tried to shower downstairs and bathe upstair at the same time. Big mistske, ran out of hot water in a couple minutes so we ended up with a cold shower and bath. The next night, two successful showers down (spread out by about 16 hours) but just an okay bath up. Heated water on the stove to wash hair the next morning. The next night another successful shower down and mediocre bath up. It seems like upstairs wasn't getting adequate hot water. I let the host know and he said he will look into it.
Also, could use paper towels, kleenex, dish sponges. There was a quarter of a paper towel roll there, but I wasn't sure if it was from the host or a previous guest.
Some of the coffee cups were very dirty, like they were stored without being washed properly.
The Murphy bed was comfortable and so was the upstairs bed. It was a quiet location with plenty of parking, easy access to the Norwich Inn and Spa on foot or by car. Check in and check out were simple. Host is very responsive and courteous.
Overall, a good first experience."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful long weekend at the villa celebrating a birthday! The villa itself is just as pictured — tastefully decorated, very clean and cozy. Krista provided lovely personal touches — along with birthday decor, she offered fresh fruit, snacks, lots of choices for coffee, etc. The bathrooms and kitchen were well stocked. The villa is perfectly situated near the Spa at Norwich Inn, where we enjoyed a full spa day. Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun are close by for shows and great restaurants in the evenings, and Mystic is a quick half hour away. Krista was extremely responsive to all communication and offered helpful recommendations to local eateries. Directions to the villa and instructions for checking in & out were clear and easy. We definitely would stay here again when back in the area."

When we were not at the casino, we relaxed comfortably in the living area playing games (some games were provided), listening to music on the Apple Home pod, or sleeping on the comfortable beds. The space and linens were very clean. Krista went the extra steps by providing a clear and helpful manual, snacks, drinks, games, and much more. The neighbors were quiet and nice.

The place is in a nice peaceful area surrounded by trees and wildlife (saw quite a few deer). at the same time you are less than 5 mins away from the casino with plenty of things to do.
Krista was a great communicator that let us know about what is going with the pool and the condo itself. she was available and answered quickly when we went to the wrong entrance!

We were so deeply moved by Krista's lovely welcome gifts in honor of our recent nuptials. Her handwritten card warmed our hearts, we enjoyed delicious chocolates, a festive balloon, celebratory sparkling cider, and GORGEOUS roses. We felt instantly comfortable in their home, and felt care and attention everywhere. We took advantage of every possible opportunity to use the pool and hot tub, particularly since we were gifted with such unseasonably warm temps. We loved watching the NY Liberty team conquer during the WNBA semifinals at nearby Mohegan Sun. One of the highlights of our trip was having an absolute blast at the Drag Show at the comedy club. The condo was impeccably clean, had every possible amenity, and included personal touches throughout. l simply cannot recommend staying in Krista's place enough!"

Stayed a few nights","If you're debating between a hotel or this villa, pick this villa. I was looking for a place to stay for a friend's wedding and needed something close to New London train station and the wedding venue. If you're coming from NYC, it's nice to have an option to take the Amtrak and not have to deal with traffic on I-95. Easy to get a Lyft/Uber to get around.
You know you're in safe hands when you step in a place that knows the art of hospitality. I truly love it when a person know what you need before you can ask them. This isn't a place you just stay and sleep. After your travels, this place makes you feel rekindled, provided for, and at ease. Fantastic communication, cozy home, and good vibes. 10 out of 10 will recommend."

The villa itself was really nice, and well decorated! The amenities (particularly the hot tub) were also amazing, and we’re more than excited to try to book the villa again another time in the future. The casino is also nearby so there’s definitely a lot to explore there too!
We truly enjoyed our stay, thank you Krista!"

Stayed a few nights","Five star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stay! If I can give ten stars I would! I have been staying at a air bnbs since 2018 and this is by far THE BEST STAY that I have ever had. I felt like royalty! The quality of what you receive with this stay is far more than what your paying for ! So affordable and the amenities are to die for! Krista and Franks villa was phenomenal! From the two beautiful vanities that were placed for me to get my makeup done while feeling like a million bucks to the quaint and cozy balcony where I spent many nights and mornings admiring the view! We got to relax in the pool , hot tub, and sauna that were all complimentary with our stay! On our last night we enjoyed a night at Mohegan Sun which was but minutes from our villa! We had dinner at Tao Asian Bistro and tried our luck at the Blackjack tables! Krista and Frank are amazing hosts. Their attention to detail, fast response time, kindness, and hospitable nature is what will have me coming back to Norwich on a more regular basis! This is an automatic yes for my family and I! And I will recommend this stay to anyone looking for a relaxing, cozy getaway in the local New England area! Krista and Frank thank you so much for having this listing and for giving me a perfect way to end my summer!"

Stayed with kids",Krista’s villa was amazing .. sooo clean and so nicely decorated .. it made it very comfortable for our family and literally felt like home .. the little things really made it great .. all the coffee they provided .. even the make up wipes to the condiments in the fridge .. location is so close to everything and so much to do all within miles .. the pool and hot tub was great and right around the corner .. plenty of parking .. I can’t wait to visit Connecticut again and stay here .. her house rules weren’t as long as The Bible .. very simple and very easy .. the villa was a perfect size for our family of 4 and having 2 full bathrooms were a dream !!! Even the snacks she provided were so yummy !! I mean I can go on and on with every little and big things we loved but I’m sure y’all get the point .. LOVED this place and CANNOT wait to stay here a million more times :) we had the best weekend and this villa definitely contributed to it

It was very clean, updated, and decorated so nicely. It was two levels, had two full bathrooms, a dining area, living area, small functional kitchen, and a small patio with two chairs. There were many items available for guests such as snacks, ice in the freezer, a coffee station with all the fixings, toiletries, plenty of towels etc.. It was located inside an adorable spa / resort with lots of amenities on site and lots of parking. There was a restaurant, with an outdoor patio with a beautiful view a bar, spa / spa services, & an outdoor pool / hot tub. It was close to Foxwoods Casino as well. We’d definitely stay again as it was an excellent experience!"

Historic and quaint but oder free and modern in its amenities. Jake was very responsive, helpful and kind. The neighborhood was historic and quiet. I think what stood out the most was the attention to detail - a guest's every need and wish seems to have been thought of and provided for. Stocked cabinets and refrigerator, a jar filled with every toiletry item imaginable - just in case you forgot something, helpful and friendly notes about the apartment. We had a wondeful stay and would recommend the 1771 House enthusiatically! Thank you Jake and Deb!"

The community surrounding the villa is quiet and peaceful and we enjoyed walking around behind the villa which has a pond and a bridge. The villa has scenic views of the golf course. Clubhouse amenities include a fitness center and a hot tub/ sauna, and a pool but it was closed at this time of year. Located about 5 minutes from Mohegan and 15 from Foxwoods, Mystic aquarium is not far either. Overall it was a very relaxing weekend and I would love to come back again and enjoy what the Norwich Inn located on the property has to offer (massages/spa) as well."

Me and my gf had a great time and had a great stay and would highly recommend John’s place. That’ll def be our go-to spot to stay anytime we feel like we just have a little too much money and we wanna go donate every dollar we bring to the casino. Maybe next time we’ll actually win and buy John’s place, we liked it THAT much."

His home is so welcoming, gives the historic Norwich vibe and I loved that the bedroom had double doors so you could close it off from the rest of the home when a friend would stop by. Let’s be real, living out of a duffel bag or suitcase the bedroom tends to look like a tornado just came through especially when there’s two of you changing throughout the day for different events. Overall we had a lovely stay and would definitely book with John again!"

John and Kristine are very attentive to your needs should you have any. I think it will be hard to find more caring and nicer ABNB hosts. I work very hard for my money. I’m glad it went to these amazing people. Thank You so very much!!!

It was extremely clean and very home feeling! The back patio was so nice to just sit out and drink a cup of coffee first thing in the morning overlooking the golf course! I highly recommend it for a future stay! especially if it's a couples getaway! We did not think we were going to feel like it was a little getaway because we are from Connecticut but it still felt like we were in a totally different area which was great! And it Is that the casino was only 10 minutes away so the drive did not seem so horrible at 2:00 a.m.! Lol!"

The space is small, but clean, comfortable and well equipped. Slept well on the king bed. I was happy to provide several recommendations to improve the accommodations. The villa neighbors a golf course. I found it odd that the groundskeepers were out mowing and cutting well before 07:00. Prep for early morning tee times I suppose. Still, I do recommend."

Stayed one night","This place was good for a one night stay being so close to Foxwoods. There were a couple things that I did not like about the place. We came in a fairly large sized truck, and was told there was off street parking behind the house, but we could not find any driveway behind the house even with the instructions. we ended up having to park on the narrow road. Also, when we arrived, the bathroom door did not even close, but my boyfriend was able to fix it with the tools in his truck. It also does not have a lock on the door, nor does the outlet in the bathroom work.
Besides those minor things, it was a great place to crash for a night after the casino. It had extra pillows and blankets, heat worked great for the cold night, and it had all the amenities we could have needed!"

Stayed a few nights","For just a bit more than a hotel, we found Ron's place that could accommodate my sister and niece as well and decided to go for it.
Upon check-in (which was easy) we were delighted to find that the space was clean, bright, open, and comfortable. The bedrooms were spacious with plenty of room around the beds and closet space, and the kitchen was well-stocked with anything we could need to make breakfast in the mornings and tea at night.
The in-unit washer + dryer was an awesome bonus!
The only thing to be aware of is that there is another unit downstairs and sound travels throughout the entire house. Most of the days/nights there were either quiet folks or no one staying downstairs and it was perfect, but if you have a large enough party, it's probably worth renting the downstairs too so you don't have to take your chances."

Stayed one night","Ron was terrific communicator. The apartment was very clean, and we’ll maintained, considering its age. The kitchen was nicely updated good size and well appointed . There is no living room for gathering, but the kitchen has a nice size table with benches that would accommodate 4 comfortably. We only used the back bedroom and it was a good size, and although mattress was good quality, it was way too hard for my aching bones! Bath was very small, but clean. Would have liked the room darkening shade that was on the door also in the window,
I was disappointed in Norwich and the neighborhood. In general,Norwich looks sadly economically depressed. Not much available for dining. I booked it mainly because of proximity to Mohegan Sun and and the price. If you are looking for an affordable alternative to the pricier Mohegan hotel, this is just fine for a night or two. I think my expectations were a little different from reality when I book it. My problem… not the listing or the property."

Other than that there was really no nightlife around and so we got back around 11pm and it seems like the people in APT A were running around downstairs and you can hear every footstep shake the house a bit.
The house is clean and fairly priced based on its proximity to Mohegan, if your into that sort of night then this is a good option to stay at. I do wish the beds were more comfy as I woke up sore the next day."

There is a washer and dryer inside, not outside the unit and they graciously provide everything needed to wash including ironing board and iron. There was nothing lacking here absolutely nothing. The beds along with the quality linen made for a heavenly sleep both nights. For the rate we had it was worth far more. And the neighborhood is definately quiet. Highly recommended without question!"

Even though there is no real living room, there is a sitting area & each individual bedroom has it's own TV and the beds and bedsheets more than made for it. Bed linen and pillows are worth the stay. It was an extra bonus that I didn’t have to put my personal Netflix password in to use it. Folgers coffee was delicious in the morning. Heat worked well and security was good. The extra water in the frig was helpful when we ran out of our own late at night.
Overall worth the stay and most appreciative of the decent price, as most AirBnb’s these days have gone way out of regular peoples price range. Thanks for a very nice space for our stay Ron!"

The apartment had everything we needed for the next morning (we brought our own food) but were pleased by the coffee, tea, sugars etc and other little touches provided in the kitchen for us. Can't beat it as the price for an area hotel for the night for the three of us would have been double the cost of Ronald's adorable apartment. I came with my parents for my mom's 60th birthday and trust me a 28 year old does not want to have to stay in the same room as her 60 year old parents so it was great that we could be together in the same apartment. Thanks and will be back again on our next overnight casino trip."

Stayed a few nights","This was by far the best Airbnb place we’ve ever stayed in. Very clean and we felt very comfortable upon arrival. Their place just felt like home with the decorations, furniture, extra thoughtful little things. The pools were awesome and warm. My daughter was able to night swim! They are very quick to respond to any concerns. Very clean and had a small outdoor space. Would definitely stay again…I almost want to keep their place a secret so I can book it again for next year’s volleyball tournament at Mohegan Sun!"

Had everything I could want or need, including a comfy firm bed, a towel warmer, and so important for my stays: a fan to use at night!
The surroundings were beautiful and peaceful. I thoroughly enjoyed this stay."

Stayed one night","This is the perfect getaway! We chose to book for a stay-cation and I can't wait to book again! This location is close to everything - steps from the Norwich Inn and Spa, 5 minutes from Mohegan Sun, and steps from a golf course. The property is incredibly quiet with beautiful walking paths and two clubhouses (seasonal) that offer a small gym, hot tub, two swimming pools, and more. The unit has everything you could need and more including a welcoming snacks and a binder with information on the property and surrounding area. I'm a bit of a neat-freak and this unit went above my standards. There is nothing more refreshing then walking into a pristine unit after a day at the spa. It's easy to kick back and relax in this adorable rental. Looking forward to staying again!"

Stayed a few nights","Kelly’s place was a true OASIS for me. Just like the spa next door, the condo was outfitted with nice amenities such as all toiletries you can think of, welcome snacks and waters, flurry robes, a towel/robe warmer, Alexa enabled devices, books and games, gas fireplace and a tub large enough to soak in! The condo sits right next door to the best day spa ever - I indulged and was not disappointed. 7 min drive to Mohegan Sun and 25 min to downtown Mystic. Condo was perfect and comfortable to just chill out in which I did both nights. The condo has 2 community areas, closest one with a big indoor hot tub, sauna, gym and seasonal outdoor pool. Both community area and Norwich Spa are a short walk from the condo location."

Stayed one night","The perfect place for a romantic getaway! Kelly was super responsive and helpful. We only had a little bit of time away and we were able to make the most out of it with her suggestions and guidebook. I was very impressed with the ￼organization and thoughtfulness that went into her space. We felt very welcomed and comfortable! The robes, heated towel warmer and welcome basket were the perfect touch! My personal favorite part, was the incredible detail and effort that went into the welcome binder/guidebook. She thought of everything and it was presented in such a professional way. It was typed with pictures, beautifully formatted, had everything you could possibly think of included from dining suggestions and entertainment to family friendly activities and day trips to local places! The bed was a little stiff for our liking, but other than that it was perfect! We look forward to coming back again."

Perfect for catching a show at The Mohegan Sun (5 min. ride away) without breaking your budget for hotel / casino pricing. Beautifully located in a Spa and Golf Inn that includes full spa treatments, indoor pools, health center, a restaurant, and is great for any golf enthusiasts. Private with plenty of outdoor space and conveniently cornered, first within the grounds. Loved the special added touches (coffee bar, cozy terrace, electric fire place, clean comfy linens, and the bath robes are examples of what makes Kelly a top host). We will definitely be back, and keep this place cherished in our memories of perfect weekends."
