Stayed with kids","This was my first time experiencing North Carolina, and a tiny home, and I was so pleasantly surprised how much I loved both! This tiny gem in the middle of gorgeous woods was just the peaceful respite we required. My three-year-old loved the deck, the loft bedroom, and had an absolute blast. The shower was so nice after a long day of travel, and I loved sharing close space with my family without feeling cramped.
Hosts were very kind and thoughtful and made sure we had everything we required. Wish we had more time to experience it!
Would highly recommend and would book again."

We really enjoyed it and sadly we didn’t have enough time to go see the other tiny homes that Brett was working on. Great experience in our first tiny home! Our family already wants to book their own trip to visit! 🩷

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay. It was a great location out in the country, no traffic but modern conveniences just up the road. It was just as described. The bed was very comfortable and slept cool. The upper windows and ceiling fan created a nice cross breeze. It was also a nice view of the sky in the morning. Easy check in and Brett messaged me upon my arrival to ensure everything went smoothly. Just as described you can hear the paintball next door on the weekend but by the time they got started I was off to my events for the day and they did not play once it got dark so it wasn’t an issue. I would definitely stay again. Thanks so much Brett"

Stayed a few nights",Tiny Blue was perfect for our quick anniversary get away! It was so peaceful and tucked away which was exactly what we were looking for. Brett cautioned that we may hear noises from the paintball field not too far away but we never heard a thing even though it was packed both days! We cooked and ate out by the fire pit one night and while we were eating Brett messaged to let us know there were deer all in the yard behind Tiny Blue! It was so magical to be eating dinner while the deer grazed and ate as well right by us!!! It was a great trip!

The firepit was great and feeding the chickens was an added plus! If you are looking for a small space to stay with plenty of things to do, you should stay here! Many local restaurants, distilleries, wineries, and hiking locations available within a 20 minute drive. Did I mention there are chickens!!! 😀"

Stayed one night","This was an extraordinary bucket list stay that will not be our last in this cozy, fully stocked, comfy, and peaceful, tiny home. What an amazing experience for my hubby and I, along with our son who recently turned 18, and his pal. The four of us had an absolute blast! We spent the evening at a Charlotte Hornets basketball game and settled into our tiny home nooks after we returned. We opened the windows to fall asleep to the soothing sounds of nature. At sunrise, the light danced across our tiny home space creating an unbelievably spacious feel. The owners were so kind and we enjoyed sharing a little bit about each other and our passion for tiny homes. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a stay in this tiny home. There are multiple venues for breakfast, lunch, and dinner within minutes but this tiny home location is peaceful and off the beaten path if calm and mindfulness is a must."

We had a minor issue but Brett really went the extra mile to make things right for us and we really appreciate that. This is my wife and I's first time staying at a tiny home, but will definitely not be the last. We will absolutely be staying with them in the future. Brett is Definitely an asset to Airbnb. Wishing you many more years in the future with hosting. I've stayed in a lot of places before, but this is by far been my best experience. Thanks for a memorable and amazing trip."

Stayed one night","I’ve been wanting to stay in a tiny house for some time now. Brett’s place was indeed tiny but super cute. Upon arrival we had an unexpected welcome party of about 15-20 ladybugs inside, no fault of Brett. He offered to come right over & take care of them but we were able to use the vacuum provided to do a catch & release ourselves! We were not quite prepared for the paintball complex at the end of the gravel path near the home. So there was some noise from that & quite a bit of dust kicked up from the cars. But after closing time all was quiet. The shower was very small (think tiny house!) & the water pressure was really low. There was only one bath towel provided but we did have two wash cloths & a hand towel. There was coffee & essentials provided plus bottled water & some apples in the fridge. I can’t say a whole lot about the bed, just a mattress on the floor of the loft. Overall it was a neat overnight experience."

Stayed with kids","If if I could give 10 stars and 2 thumbs up, I would!
We had the absolute BEST time! Off the beaten path feel, with the convenience of being real close to town.
We always try to get out and explore while we stay away from home, and this was a great location for that! We are nature lovers, and boy did we get our fill! Deer, lizards, turtles, toads, frogs, a vast variety of birds, and the friendliest host chickens!!
If nature isn’t for you, I’d still highly recommend! Inside Tiny Blue is comfy and cute! Hop in your car and you’re 3 minutes from a gas station and 5 minutes from the bigger stores and restaurants.
We got the pleasure of touring the Tiny Homes that Brett is currently building, as well as the neighboring paint ball field (of which we never heard a noise from, which wouldn’t have bothered us a bit, but was still very nice!)
I could go on and on about the absolute pleasure we had staying here, and will definitely be back to stay again! Brett and Heather, thank you so much!"

Heather has a beautiful garden next to the porch. For breakfast, Brett invited us up to gather some fresh eggs. Talk about amazing!

Room for board games, family TV and lounging, outdoor adventures. My sons were able to feed and pet chickens and told me they were living their best lives. It had a quiet, country feel outdoors but fully modern interior. Two lofts provided the perfect bedding set up. The mini toiletries were adorable! There is even a guide to local restaurants and more on tiny home living. Well-laid out design, comfortable, and we definitely hope to be able to return soon! A 5 out 5 stay, incredible! Exactly what we were looking for! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Awesome tiny house! It had everything we needed for a short stay. The property is back behind trees and is mostly private, you can just barely see the host's home between trees in the back. On the weekends it is noisy and some traffic since there is a paintball field/center across the way, but it did not disrupt us. We enjoyed the fire pit, feeding the chickens (made me feel right at home), a walk in the woods, and exploring old sheds from the original land owners was cool. It was 4 min from Walmart and many other local stores and amenities yet feels like you are in a remote property once back at the house! First time in a tiny house :)"

Stayed one night","Tiny Blue was a wonderful stay! My boyfriend and I only stayed for one night after a wedding but it was an adorable place and just like the pictures. They had board games and a binder filled with rules for games present in the yard as well as food suggestions. It was quite cold when we stayed in there but it was also 22 degrees fahrenheit the night we stayed! I would definitely recommend being comfortable with the people you stay with here as it would be difficult to change/get ready in the rest room but I would expect that with any tiny house. Overall, I really enjoyed the stay, the place was beautiful and wonderfully prepared for activities. It would be quite fun in the summer."

Brett was super accommodating with anything we needed or asked for ….He did a great job packing a lot of usable essentials into a small space. Even a small washer/dryer! If you haven’t tried tiny living and wonder what it’s like come for a stay…..we highly recommend"

Stayed with kids","Tiny Blue was just as described! The tiny house experience was fun for our family of 3. My 14 year old son loved having his own loft and ladder. Tiny living is surprisingly very functional and we enjoyed all the little nooks and crannies and storage. The front porch is wonderful and my son enjoyed sitting outside playing his guitar and singing. We were out and about most of our stay but Tiny Blue is conveniently located near Locust and the wedding venue we were at for our friends. We wish we would have had more down time to enjoy the hammock and other games in the deck box (definitely check those out). My son and fiancé did get to play horseshoes and feed the chickens which was great! Just some notes and not at all a negative reflection on this place because we would absolutely stay here again. There is a paintball place past Tiny Blue and traffic can get heavy at times early on Friday morning (my early is 9am) but there is no sound from the paintball place from inside the house. Be prepared to climb stairs and hunch over to get in the bigger loft area. This was not a problem for us as we are 5’3 and 5’6 but taller people should take note. If you sit up in the middle of the night you might hit your head on the ceiling. The only other thing is if you want to sleep late be aware the sun comes through the windows and there is really no way to block this out. For us, we had to be up early anyway. Brett was very kind and very quick to offer his assistance with anything we needed. He was very friendly during our communication and I wish we could have met in person! We will definitely be staying again when we come to visit our friends!"

The most surprising things were the full-sized fridge and shower. The host went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay and even gave us farm fresh eggs for the weekend! The tiny house is tucked away, so it's quiet with the only sound being the occasional car heading to the adjacent paintball field. I needed assistance getting the oven going, and Brett came over right away to replace the propane tank. We will definitely be staying here again!"

The music from the bar didn’t bother us at all. We were so comfortable and felt so at home. I definitely will be booking to stay here every-time i visit!

You can walk to the train in 5 minutes, you can drive downtown in 5 minutes. Friday night things started to ramp up party wise with music and people all around and we were not affected by the noise.
The loft stayed quiet enough for us to sleep. Nice place, thanks."

Stayed a few nights","If you read one review, read this one. The host isn't going to like this review I'm sure, but I would not stay here again. Yes, the host describes the A/C unit noise and does provide earplugs, but I went 2 nights with very little sleep due to the loud slamming bang of the AC unit (when it kicks on) and noise of it running that follows. It's unlike anything I have ever experienced at a rental before.
The space was clean and had super quirky décor. The bed was massive and the mattress was comfortable.
I think the host is in between a rock and hard place. The AC unit is for the whole building (multiple restaurants and flats) and it just happens to be directly above the bedroom in this unit.
Overall it's not the hosts fault, but potential renters should be aware of the issue at hand."

Stayed a few nights","Booked Marc’s place last minute and holy crap not only did the property exceed expectations but the neighborhood is an absolute goldmine of great local businesses!
Book your stay and then check out Smelly Cat Coffee for incredible coffee and breakfast sandwiches , Salud Cerverceria for top tier pizza and amazing beer selection, Jack Beagle’s for incredible wings and gourmet Mac & cheese, all within walking distance.
The only recommendation I’d make is to bring ear plugs. At night there’s an extremely loud rooftop unit that might wake up light sleepers. The onsite documentation made mention of there being earplugs supplied in the complimentary welcome bag but mine did not include any.
Long story short: will absolutely stay here again next time I’m in Charlotte!"

Felt safe the entire time and we walked around from 9AM until after midnight. The unit is well appointed and the bed and furnishings were comfortable. The unit was exactly as described.

Stayed a few nights","I will say that the place was clean, bed and pillows were comfortable and it was right on the main drag. The issue we had was the noise level was HEAVILY downplayed. We stay in cities a lot and understand there’s bar patron noise and sirens/horns, etc but the listing failed to mention that there is a live music venue literally sharing the parking lot outside the apartment. It was as if we were at the bar and it played both Friday and Saturday nights until after midnight. There’s no tv or sleeping with this level of noise, even with the provided earplugs and a white noise machine that we brought. Additionally, the noise from the AC unit was also downplayed. It is directly above the bathroom connected to the bedroom and kicks on about every 20 minutes with a startling loud bang and sounds like there’s an electric sander grinding on top of you. We were thankful Sunday night when there was no band, but we still needed the earplugs for the loud AC unit, and we are not “light sleepers”."

When we first arrived, I think we were too excited and we had an issues as we went to the wrong door. lol. It was completely an overlook on our part. Marc response time was very fast; he was patient helping us with checking in.
When we walked in, everything was as it looked online. Everything was in pristine condition, clean sheets, bathroom was spotless, a good number of hangers in the beautiful walk in closet, shoe hanger, and Marc even had a little care package on the bed!
I prefer places like this over a hotel ANYDAY! I made coffee the next morning and to my surprise, even the coffee pot was spotless! This spot is like a home away from home. Everything you need to get to in the NODA area for us was within walking distance as we were just getting away to take a little break.

Stayed a few nights",The perfect loft pad for a show weekend at the Neighborhood Theater in Noda. Next door to Protagonist brewery and only 2 blocks from the venue. The couch was awesomely comfortable and super deep for 2 to nap/chill on during the day’s heat. The bedroom was upstairs and had a very comfortable king and down pillows. What a great find and place to get away to!

It’s a fun neighborhood to explore. The condo was clean and comfortable with everything we needed. Parking was simple with the detailed instructions we received. I recommend Marc’s place.

It didn't bother us, and earplugs are provided. The apartment is as described, and you get very detailed instructions on how to get there, and check-in was a breeze. I will rent this place next time we are in Charlotte"

The private parking included with Marc's place was a blessing. He kept the space very clean with easy to follow check in directions. After returning from our show, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony to watch a smaller band play at the spot next door. Overall, as we return to Charlotte for trips, I will be keeping he spot in mind to return to. 10/10. Thank you!!"

It was nice to be able to get fresh air from the balconies downstairs and upstairs. When we got hungry, we didn't have to drive anywhere. Less than 60 seconds walk to delicious food. I will definitely stay in NoDa again and if I'm lucky enough, I'll stay at Marc's place again."

Definitely pay attention to the warnings about noise -- it is a very active street (especially on the weekend), and the AC turning on and off was very loud. The place was spotless and as described and Marc was very responsive to our questions. The location could not be better if you're looking to immerse yourself in the local scene -- so many resaturants, bars, cafes, and interesting things to see right on the same block. We could not believe how much activity there was on Friday night with street vendors and live music! The train that goes to downtown and UNC is 2 blocks away. The bed was very soft -- could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preferences. If you're not sensitive to noise, this is a great place to check out!"

Stayed a few nights","I had to wait a few days to write this review, just to find the right words to describe how wonderful my weekend was. From the absolutely perfect decor, to everything you need being a short walk away, the live music that could be enjoyed from the balcony; I was actually sad to leave.
As noted in other reviews, this is not a place to go if you want “peace & quiet”. The nights are lively, the days are bustling. My favorite part was sitting in the yellow chair with the balcony doors open while I sipped my morning coffee from the Smelly Cat Cafe. At night there’s so much to do; and I enjoyed a show at the Evening Muse just down the street. Then I went home and listened to the cover band playing at Jack Beagles from my balcony. The music usually ended by midnight, but it’s February so…
Marc made everything so easy for check in with very detailed instructions, and check out was a breeze. The loft is very clean. And the neighborhood, as well as the building feels very safe."

Stayed one night","Incredible farm stay. The grounds are a homestead wonderland of various small-farm animals, including a lovely backporch overlooking free-roaming chickens, roosters and lovely greenery and garden areas decorating this home-grown comfort nest. The kitchen was luxe- cabin with beautiful decor, complimentary washer & dryer supplies, 2 immaculate and romantic cabin vibe atmosphere. I wouldn’t have changed a thing. I truly regret not being able to spend more than 1 night there. The creative lighting was warm and ambient. Can’t wait to have a real stay and be able to spend more time interacting with various farm activities waiting to be enjoyed. Jeremy was responsive, and extremely thorough in making me feel informed, and even invited several opportunities for farm fun activities. Truly lucky and grateful. Thank you again. Can’t wait til next time!"

Group trip","This place is amazing! It's a beautiful log cabin home on a working farm. My family and I love animals, and outdoors. Zachary was a great host and extremely accommodating. He gave us a tour of the grounds, answered all of our questions about his place and the animals, as well as giving us recommendations about hiking in the area. This place feels secluded and so peaceful, yet you are a stones through from viewing the Charlotte skyline. We attended a wedding and dinners in Charlotte and both were like 20-25 minutes from this home. HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying here. If you love nature and/or animals look no further. ;-) We have 3 boys and as soon as I saw this booking I knew this was the right place. My kids takeaway so far has only been Zachary, the log home, and all of the plants and animals. Wedding and dinner were dismal compared!"

Stayed a few nights","Zachary is a great, very sociable host. As noted, his cabin is the center-piece of an active farm, so potential renters just need to come with that in mind. Roosters crow. For myself, I loved it. Literally, a 20-minute ride from the airport (I took a flight from CLT), minutes from all the standard restaurants as well as local fare, you're on a quiet farm talking to a guy who loves hosting and loves running his farm.
The cabin itself is accurately depicted in the photos and description. Zachary has made nice updates to the place. The bed was comfy. All the amenities necessary in the kitchen, and the living area was great for relaxing in."

He is responsive to questions and also proactively made sure I knew how to get there and check in. I was at a training in the area and gone during the days but enjoyed spending some quiet moments outside in the morning and evenings, often to the sounds of the rooster, which I loved! Dogs on-site are very friendly but are in a fenced area and quiet during the night. Everything needed is included. Very clean and the bed was super comfortable. It is a rustic log cabin style home with modern upgrades that Zach has done a great job with! Thanks for an awesome stay! If I needed to return to the area, I would definitely stay here again! 😊"

We were greeted upon arrival by his pack of beautiful white dogs (they were penned and so well-behaved!), roaming chickens, and a very friendly and informative Zachary himself. The cabin was super clean and beautiful. I am a plant person and really loved his beautiful collection inside the cabin. Our only regret was having to leave earlier than planned the next morning due to the rain (and 4 hour drive ahead.) Because of this we unfortunately missed out on his offer to let the kids feed the pigs in the morning and play with the dogs some more. This will give us a reason to come back the next time we find ourselves in the area. Thank you, Zachary!"

We arrived from CT to NC early and I contacted Zachary asking if there was a way to check in early.
He had guests from the previous reservation, but said if they leave earlier and he had plenty of time to clean, we could check in.
We visited with our daughter and he gave us an early check in at 1:30, which we appreciated.
When we arrived, my husband was so excited to see the homestead.
Zachary meet us as we drove in.
He was very friendly and gave us his story of the homestead.
He introduced us to his animals as well as PUPPIES!
The home was very clean. Had everything that was noted in the ad for the AirBNB.
The plants in his home were beautiful! I was a little jealous :)
It was very relaxing watching the chickens!
You must like animals, nature and understand this is homestead life to truely appreciate his place
We both wish we had more time to spend there.
If he will have us, we will definitely use his place again."

The house itself was very cozy and comfortable--we slept easy in the bed, and had no trouble with the bathroom or kitchen. It's hidden enough to feel secluded, but residential enough to have an easy drive into. The animals make exactly the amount of noise you'd expect from a place listed as a homestead--quiet at night but reasonably chicken-y in the mornings. It was only about a 20-30min drive to all the fun places in inner city Charlotte. The host was extremely responsive and friendly, and really looked out for our general safety and wellbeing. I couldn't recommend this place enough, we hope to go back!"

Stayed a few nights","This stay was really lovely, and I can’t wait to go back. Zachary was a very friendly host, responsive and kind. I even got a little tour of the plants and animals on site, and to feed the pigs a pumpkin, which was super fun. The cabin feels “off the beaten path” without being too far out of town, which is really nice when you’re trying to combine activites in Charlotte with a little break for yourself too. The beds were comfy, the bathroom is lovely, and there were lots of nice places to sit and take a call or read inside and outside. I will definitely book again!
One note…remember that animals on site means animal noises on site. Chickens are gonna chicken, roosters are gonna rooster, dogs bark if they’re startled, but if you dig that vibe, it’s really fantastic. I loved watching and hearing the chickens roam and the pups keep the place safe for their chicken friends - I’m sure you will too."

Also there's something just therapeutic about this place that even after one night away I feel absolutely rested and ready to take on the world!

Got to meet the cutest cuddliest dogs 😭🫶🏼 loved the garden, chickens, and the pigs. Location was so peaceful and also just a 20 min. drive to the city, which was perfect for what I came here for. The guitar in the cabin was also a plus since I forgot to bring my guitar. Wish I stayed longer. Definitely will be back. 🤎"

Awesome spot for morning coffee. Very private and quiet. Not far at all from ""civilization"", but feels like such a secret spot. Zachary is an incredible host. He is quick to reply and always super helpful and warm. His place is so comfortable and always spotless! Everything you could possibly need during a stay is here. And Zachary is committed to making sure you have anything you need. I will definitely be back for a 3rd time and more!"

Stayed one night",Zachary was an awesome host! He did a great job communicating with me before I arrived and checking in to see when I'd arrive. Everything was absolutely immaculate! Very quiet and peaceful spot. And the cabin is much bigger than he mentions so that's a perk too The porch out back is such a great spot to relax and just look over the chickens and all of the plants and property. I had too quick of a visit so I booked a return four days later as I head back to town. I'm so excited to arrive early enough to be able to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet at this place. Kudos Zachary!

Stayed one night","Zachary’s place was amazing! If you are looking for a get-away that is full of peace and connected to the serenity of nature, his farm-cabin would be the perfect place and space for you. The cabin was spacious with all the amenities without taking away from the simplicity of the off-the grid feeling you get as soon as you enter the gated sanctuary. I’m a early riser, so I went out to see where the roosters were that were setting the atmosphere for what was going to be one of the most amazing (AirBnB) stays I have ever had. Once outside Zachary was already up attending to the chicken, which he invitingly allowed me to partake in the connective movements with all of his rescue animals (dogs, chickens, and pigs) Zachary was so personable with his education on the garden, the animals, and the history of the farm. I enjoyed the conversation, walking, and taking pictures of so many amazing plants, flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Zachary, topped off the amazing tour with 6 beautiful eggs."

The kitchen is perfectly designed and organized, beautiful dishes and extras. The bath....WOW fantastic shower! On demand hot water. The toilet we have never seen before, didn't know there was such a thing. Such a smart idea. Privacy and calmness, set back from a main road, plus only 8 miles from the Charlotte Speedway!

The home was spotless and welcoming, the surroundings beautiful, and all the amenities were top-notch, including yoga mats, a convenient little space heater, and snacks. Hailey is super friendly, a fantastic communicator, and kindly accommodated my late checkout. I was concerned that I would not have transportation during my stay, but I had no problem requesting Lyft when needed. I also made an evening stroll to the recommended pizza spot and was happy to learn it was on a well-lit sidewalk the whole way. Also, take advantage of the neighborhood greenway--easy access across the street--for your daily walk or run. Thanks again for a restful stay; I will not hesitate to return on my next trip to Charlotte!"

This is not your typical airbnb, which was why we wanted to check it out, and it was GREAT! Our hosts were extremely responsive and made us feel like special guests. The remodeled shipping container was well done and thought out. It felt spacious in spite of the size. Beds were extremely comfortable with fresh linens and could actually sleep four. Kitchen was stocked with everything you could think of, including a few snacks. It was a peaceful location and the weather was perfect for sitting on the front porch with morning coffee and an evening beverage. We even tried out the outdoor bathtub, which was like sitting in a hot tub. A friend came with me on this trip, but I'm thinking about bringing my husband for a weekend get-away!

You can just tell with the little things equipped in the home where all premium quality items. Which honestly was must appreciated ! This made me feel like Hailey truly cares about the comfortably of her guests. The out door tub was a 10/10 , it became very chilly the weekend of my stay .It was just so perfect to heat up the tub and just relax to take in all the natures beauty.

LOVED the rocking chairs and the outside bath. You come off the main road onto a beautiful long driveway and suddenly you feel like you’re in the countryside. Quiet and secluded. But downtown Charlotte is still only like 20 minutes away with the train stop a couple minutes away too. It’s surprisingly well insulated. The design is so smart to make it feel roomy and give you everything you need in a smaller space. And Hailey herself was a lovely host. They really give you your space, but were ready to help if I had questions. I hope to have more business down there and return!! Thanks Hailey!"

Priscilla was super sweet and communicated me with throughout our stay. I gave this home a 4 star because the floors were not cleaned. If we didn’t have a baby we would have not known because it isn’t visibly dirty. Once letting Priscilla she did offer to send her cleaners back to clean the floors but we offered to do it ourselves because that meant we would have needed to leave the home while the cleaners were there.
Other than that the home was beautiful! The backyard was our favorite spot!! Lots of space. We took advantage of the projector and fire pit.

Stayed a few nights","Priscilla & Andy were such amazing hosts!! We traveled in for a wedding and when I messaged them asking if their home had an iron since we would have dresses & suits, she responded that they didn’t but that she would overnight one to the house. Such amazing, accommodating hosts! The home was spotless and looked exactly like the pictures. It was a quick 10 minute ride into town and conveniently located to where we needed go for our event. This may have been one of the most well decorated/clean Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. Priscilla was so responsive when I messaged her with questions and everything with check in/out was so smooth.
One item I do want to mention is this home is outside of the city in a run down neighborhood. I don’t want to say we felt unsafe, but we were extremely cautious of our surroundings when we were outside in the front/back of the home."

Stayed a few nights",This house is EVERYTHING that was advertised. It was absolutely perfect for a solo trip. My family that lives in Charlotte came to visit me and said they will definitely recommend this place to family and friends that are visiting Charlotte. Priscilla and Andy check in on me during my stay which I thought was great. The location was perfect. The back yard was so relaxing and we loved the fire pit. The neighborhood was quiet. The train was not a problem. I absolutely loved the house and will definitely book with Pricilla and Andy again.

Our stay was very comfortable, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed the homey feel of the place. I cannot express enough how effortless the check in and check out process is—super comforting when you have a long distance to travel before and after your stay. While in Charlotte, we were able to get to the city for less than $10 with Uber, and there was so much in the area that was accessible in a walkable distance. Overall, such an amazing and comfortable experience—thank you so much Ross and we’ll be sure to come back in the future!!"

Highly recommend this location to enjoy Charolette and will definitely be staying here every time visiting Charolette.

Stayed a few nights","Unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short for reasons completely unrelated to the quality of the AirBnB, so take my experience with a grain of salt. The check-in process was clear. The BnB was clean and orderly. Ross was responsive and friendly. That said, the little things may make or break this place for you. The BnB is effectively a MIL suite in the backyard of the host’s house—which in and of itself is fine—but you will hear kids running around. You’ll need to do a three-point turn to get out the parking spot allocated to you as a guest. The windows in the living room and bathroom do not have blinds or privacy filters. This may not concern you, as the suite is on the second story, but for my wife, she felt exposed when using the facilities, with a full view of the neighbor’s backyard. If you can live with these compromises, then hey, it’s a great deal located in the heart of Noda, restaurants and entertainment all around, with a well-organized host with plenty of recommendations."

Stayed one night","I was not able to stay at Ross's place due to the area losing power however I'm giving 5 stars due to the way he handled the situation. In the age of many Airbnb's being run by businesses, it was refreshing to have human to human interaction with decency and not sorting through some corporate policy. Ross gave me a full refund on the day of the reservation. With that in mind, I can fully reccomended this listing as I'm confident if anything goes wrong Ross will take care of you."

Stayed one night","This was a perfect stay. We will definitely return to this Airbnb. It was the perfect stay for a couple. Area is spacious. Everything was extremely clean. Host responds quickly. My only advice would be to let the host know when you are arriving. There is a gate they initially have to let you in then they give you an opener. I failed to let them know I was much earlier than expected and had to wait to be let in the gate. As long as you let them know your arrival time everything else will be seamless. This space was homey, spotless and relaxing. It’s also in a great location- close to everything. We stayed for a concert and we’re only 10 minutes away. Thanks for having us! 10/10"

It's just a kitchenette (as described), but you really don't need a kitchen because you'll be too busy eating at all the phenomenal restaurants that are walkable (in the neighborhood, Uptown) + further neighborhoods that are just as accessible with public transit (NoDa via lynx, for example). Great location and great communication with Enya. Couldn't ask for anything more."

I loved walking around the neighborhood along the trails and sidewalks. If you're up for walking a lot you don't even need a car (I didn't have one while I was in Charlotte). I walked to work downtown and walked to breweries, restaurants and coffee shops. Only occasionally did I get a Lyft back if it was pretty dark out or my feet were done!"

My daughter and I were very satisfied and will now book this darling apartment whenever we stay in Charlotte.... Five stars, highly recommend!"

It was somewhat noisy in the early AM hours on second night from neighbors but there is another unit right next door. If temp in apartment needs to be adjusted, you can let host know as well. Would stay again if returning to Charlotte in future. 😀"

The hosts were responsive, which was important because the apartment--half a duplex--has its thermostat in the hosts' side of the residence. A very secure and safe method of unlocking and locking the apartment door digitally seemed unnecessarily complex to us. Upon arrival, we had a short period of confusion trying to download and install the necessary app while traveling. Others may not find this to be a problem. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and affordable."

Enya has thought of everything you could want or need in setting up this space. Her guidebook was also thorough and well-thought out. Even her response to a small hitch with the lock was prompt and kind.
The space IS on the small side, but surprisingly didn't feel too small and it perfectly suited our needs.
I highly recommend this space and will book it again whenever we come back to the area!"

Overall, a good experience."

We loved that about it. Marcus was a fantastic host. We ran into a couple of issues with pipes due to very cold temps while we visited, and he was on it immediately, and even came back later to double check. The bungalow also went offline while we were visiting (it wasn't a huge issue for us, as we were not there for much of the time it was down) but he was sure to alert us immediately. It is modern, pristine, and very comfortable. We wanted to stay longer! We would absolutely book the Bamboo Bungalow again when visiting Charlotte."

Stayed a few nights",The stay was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and I just wanted to get away for a few days and it was perfect. Marcus gave us the option to check in early if need be and communicated very well and in a timely fashion. The space had everything we needed throughout the stay and was extremely clean. Could not have asked for a better house or host.

Everything was close by, within a 10-15 min car ride. Great privacy, well kept, cleanliness, and aesthetically perfect! Would recommend to a friend and would try to book again if I go back to Charlotte!"

We highly recommend!"

Marcus really thought about it all. The shower was huge, the beds were very comfortable, all outlets were labeled, a full use kitchen, & W/D (extra touch). Marcus was a great host!"

The interior of the bungalow is modern, extremely clean with comfy beds. The exterior with all the bamboo makes it feel like an oasis. Sitting in the back steps in the evening, watching the fireflies, hearing the cicadas, feeling the warmth of summer…truly a memorable experience. Should my travels bring me back to Charlotte, this is the first place I’ll check for availability! Absolutely gorgeous, peaceful, and perfect! Thank you, Marcus!"

The bamboo woods and giant owl flying through the yard made us feel like we were in a scenic wonderland. The home is nestled behind 2 homes at the front of the property, a long driveway and ample parking like the description says for 2 cars. The neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors were distanced enough, and we felt like we had privacy.
Please for the love of God, please respect and maintain this airbnb, because it’s definitely a gem!

We felt that the room was a little pricey for what it was. The hotel seemed pretty dated with what felt like cheap and sloppy finishes slapped over a facility that still feels outdated.
It was not a bad stay by any means, just not what we expected based on photos, description and price. ""Relax in a luxurious and convenient hotel in trendy neighborhood"". Adjacent to but not exactly IN the up and coming neighborhood and questioning the luxurious part of description.
Very comfy bed and everything felt clean!"

The space was perfect for our four night stay. Everything we could have needed was there, and the condo was very nicely appointed. It was spacious and modern, and even had an umbrella, which came in very handy during a heavy rain one night.
We didn't need the garage, but had we been driving it would be a major plus. Easily accessible and clean.
Tamara communicated easily and often, and we never felt as if we would be on our own if anything came up.
We would absolutely stay here again, and would highly recommend it."

Tamara had very clear and precise instructions that were easy to follow along. She was very responsive and I would recommend her place to stay!"

The building and neighborhood are clean and we felt safe the entire time.

Stayed a few nights","Tamara did her very best to accommodate our needs and was very responsive. Her condo felt like staying in a Pinterest board and there was more than enough space for a couple. The location was great too… most of what we wanted to see was in walking distance, or if we didn’t feel like walking we could take the tram or a very short Uber ride. Definitely would recommend!"

Great location in a nice quiet neighbourhood. Easy walking distance to Spectrum center, 9th or 7th street rail line.
Access to the apartment and the building is very secure and private.
The living area is modern, spacious, very clean and comfortable.
Lovely large bathroom with new washer and dryer. Very handy!
Bedroom has a very comfy and huge bed, kitchen has everything you could need if you wanted to self cater for full meals.
Altogether a true gem and home from home.

Check-in is a little tricky, but the directions were so precise that it all went well. Make sure to print out a copy of the directions so you have them on hand. Condo was super clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The best part, and frankly surprising to me, was how quiet the building is. You will get a good night's sleep for sure! I highly recommend this place, and the owner is very communicative. Overall, I give it a five star rating!"

Privacy is very important to me and this space suited me and my husband wonderfully. The space was very pretty, comfortable, and clean. I also enjoyed the French press.
I know there have been some comments regarding operation of the elevator, but I was able to access the space with no problems simply by following Tamara's detailed instructions. If you travel with a ton of stuff like me, I would recommend bringing a cart to make things easier. I did not have one so I just had to make a few trips.
Overall my experience was a wonderful and I would recommend staying at Tamara's place."

Stayed one night","The pictures don't do this place justice. It is stylish, comfortable, clean, and has great natural light. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice and hot. There was coffee and creamer for the morning. And I always felt safe. She also had a nice stand up desk where I could work. The only thing I will mention is that, altho it's close to almost everything, it's not as walkable as I was thinking. Not a huge deal if you're traveling with others, but solo travelers will probably want to drive or use Uber/Lyft if you stay out late into the evening. Tamara was a great host. Highly recommended."

From the initial confirmation to our last communication with Tamara, she was absolutely wonderful to work with regarding any details. She was proactive in providing information and responded quickly to any questions that arose.Everything about this condo was perfect. It was so inviting from the moment we walked in and we found it had everything needed to meet our needs and more. Tamara even went out of her way to get us a cooler but not just one; she gave us two so we had options.
It is newly decorated and so clean. The location was perfect for our needs. The neighborhood is wonderful and most everything was within walkable distance. There are some beautiful parks in that location to enjoy. When traveling by car, the freeway was right around the corner yet you never knew it was there. I loved having underground gated parking as well.
I just can’t say enough about this condo except to say that we plan to stay there again if and when we are blessed to return. Don’t even think twice about renting this place...you’ll be glad you did!"

Once you entered the home, it was not only pleasing to the eyes, it gave you a sense of comfort. From the natural light, the oil diffuser and the comfy seating, it’s was like we were home. This home was in a prime location to walk and explore uptown Charlotte, where there were shops and restaurants and it was very close to the Hornets stadium. That was a pleasant surprise, as my husband and I love to walk the cities we visit and this one did not disappoint. There is even a convenience store right next to the complex. All in all this home was a great choice and if we were to return to Charlotte again, we would definitely stay here again. Tamara was very responsive; she was an amazing host!

Stayed with kids",My family and friends were excited about this house but our excitement soon turned to disappointment. The furniture is very outdated and the beds were really uncomfortable. They were more like cheap mattresses with a thin mattress topper. The carpets upstairs are stained and have not been cleaned in awhile. I understand that most of the price is for the pool and the size of the house but the pool furniture was even rusted. I will say host was very nice through messenger though. Would rate the house itself a 3/5 but the host a 5/5.

Mike was super responsive and went above and beyond my expectations. I would highly recommend anyone looking to stay in the Charlotte area to stay here. It was close to many Charlotte attractions and 30 minutes or less from Carowinds."

Group trip","The house was clean and had everything we needed. The host responded quickly to all messages. There was a small hiccup regarding the fee associated with an early check in, but other than that we had an overall good experience. If you request an early check in be sure to confirm the total costs before making that decision."

Stayed with kids",Our stay was great. The owner was very helpful and willing to assist. I would like to note that the only tvs that worked was the one in the living room and the one outside. The one in the master bedroom would turn on but we couldn't get it to pull up any channels. We changed all inputs but still nothing. The other tv in the bedroom with multiple beds and cots would come on also but no service was connected so we couldn't watch either. The other two bedrooms have no tv at all. If you plan on swimming at night there isn't much light. I'm not sure if that is to discourage noise and swimming at night or maybe I overlooked a plug but that was unfortunate. Other than that the home was clean and the owner was great !!!

There was plenty of space to accommodate 10 guests comfortably. Mike reached out to see if we had any concerns and responded accordingly with an immediate response. He also had the pool man there on the day we arrived to ensure the pool was clean for our enjoyment. We really enjoyed our stay, and I highly recommend them for your vacation stay."
