There was an ‘old cabin’ kind of smell to it, but it’s an older cabin so as to be expected.
Some of the windows didn’t have screens and the patio screen wasn’t in the best shape.
But, overall, it was a nice resting place during our travels."

Stayed a few nights","Aaron’s cabin was fantastic. It was a gorgeous place to celebrate our five-year anniversary. The view off the back deck was breathtaking, and we could see a family of deer walking through and a massive owl flying through the night sky. The hot tub was excellent and very well taken care of and clean. The wood-burning fireplace was also terrific, and Aaron made sure there were wood and fire starters available for us right next to the fireplace. There were clear instructions on where to go to get more supplies and pay for the supplies left for us by Aaron. We wish that we could have stayed longer than our weekend getaway. We are hoping to plan a trip during the summer for a more extended trip since we can explore the beautiful area and town. Frida’s tacos were amazing, and the Hillsboro Garden Restaurant was also great, with friendly staff."

I am so happy we decided to book a night here, because it exactly what we needed to wind down after a long trip. My family was thrilled to see the beautiful woods + cabin. As a bonus, there is a hot tub to enjoy as well!
Upon entering the cabin, the glass doors near the back of the cabin, captivate you with it enchanting scenery of the forest. It is very picturesque and serene!
We had everything we needed as far as basic amenities and didn’t feel like we were missing anything. The host is very responsive and easy to communicate with. We would love to stay here again and definitely recommend!"

The porch is huge with a great wooded view in the back, even saw a fox run through the woods! Very peaceful relaxing location and very comfortable clean home! We would happily stay again and wish we had stayed longer than just a weekend!"

Stayed one night","This was an amazing place. The deck was HUGE and the back faced into the woods. We sat out in the morning, drank our coffee and watched the squirrels chase each other through the trees. It was so peaceful and quiet but only 10 minutes away from everything. Both of us agreed it would be a great place to stay during the fall when the leaves are changing colors. The hot tub was super clean and easy to use! Didn't get to use the propane fire pit. Maybe next time . . . we'll definitely be back.
If you like craft beer, The Opera House Brewing Company is a must! The owners were super sweet and told us all about the place. Beers were great, too!"

Stayed one night","I was looking for an Airbnb away from the city to recharge and this place was perfect. The wooded setting is very relaxing, especially off the back deck where you can look down on a little creek. Town is only a few minutes away where they have a picturesque main street. Open House Brewery is amazing and Red Rooster Inn (another brewery too), both are in historic buildings which I loved. There was also live music at The Abbey, an old church converted into an event space. Ending the day in the hot tub under the stars put the whole experience over the top. This is by far the best hot tub I have ever been in. There were shoulder jets, jets for your bottom, rotating jets, it was so relaxing and clean. Last, the beds are very soft, which usually isn’t my favorite but it was pretty nice at the end of the day."

Stayed one night","You really can't tell from the review just how peaceful this rental is. So many beautiful birds singing, a family of deer, and a cardinal who sat right on the windowsill and sang to us!
The house itself was very clean. When we walked in the we could the fresh smell of a clean house.
We used the hot tub and it was delightful and functional. We didn't spend a lot of time on the beautiful wrap around porch because of the weather but we would love to come back and use the grill and large patio furniture and just enjoy nature on it.
This is not a negative, just a note for the traveler, this rental does have shampoo, conditioner, and bar soap but no other bathroom extras. I always bring my own but if you typically rely on your rental to supply everything, go ahead and pack them this time. Again, this is not a big deal to me but something to pass along.
We had planned to use the wood burning fireplace but ended up not getting to it so cannot review it.
The beds were super comfy/clean."

This cabin is perfect from the hot tub in the front, to the wooded area on the back porch. The porch wraps around beautifully there is an excellent 6 burner gas grill, and a propane heater to keep you comfortable while drying off from the hot tub.
There are plenty of comfortable places to sit outside and view all the wildlife (we see deer from the back porch every time we visit).
Inside is just as awesome as the outside. High ceilings, cozy couches, a 70” tv, and a perfect fireplace.
The kitchen is one of the best I’ve seen in a cabin, large and updated. The beds are comfy and there are Roku tvs in both of the large bedrooms.
The hosts are quickly responsive and helpful. This place has a special, relaxing, and rejuvenating atmosphere."

Overall it's a beautiful property, lots of amazing hawks an deer onsite VERY close to the property could literally see them from the hot tub. Very Laid back- this was my 1st time ever renting an Airbnb on my own & I've gotta say I will 100% be coming back I can't wait too book my next stay!

Stayed over a week","Excellent Communication! Provided virtually immediate response to a couple of minor home problems.....replaced light bulb above the kitchen sink and fixed leaking plumbing below the bathroom sink. The bathroom and small bedroom doors do not close properly and need to be adjusted. Finally, a more comfortable sofa and an additional comfortable chair needed in the living room. In addition, both additional and different art work needed on the walls in ALL rooms. Looking at a print with RATS hanging in the kitchen is not good."

Stayed over a week","What an AWESOME place and just a quick walk to downtown! Super big tv, super comfy bed, and everything you would need and then some in the kitchen. There's even lots of snacks and some food in the pantry you can cook! Downtown has lots to offer as well. Be sure to check out Opera House Brewing Company for their delicious selection. Gold Pan Records is a must for vinyl. The Orpheum Theater is a great place to watch a movie.
There's even a live theater next door! Be sure to grab some food and a drink at the Abbey on Broad. Looking forward to coming back when the Red Rooster opens too! The town is just so friendly and inviting. As someone that was displaced by a fire and needing a place to fit my needs, it ended up feeling like a second home. The hosts were AMAZING with making sure I had anything needed to get through such a stressful time. It was a perfect reminder that there are wonderful people in the world. Book Eli's place, you won't regret it!"

Stayed about a week","Very clean, simple furniture and layout, nice to have welcoming snacks and waters. Even coffee was supplied. Great to have all the minor needs of home available from paper towels, laundry detergent, soaps and shampoos, lots of pillows, games in the cabinet, bed was comfortable, plenty of pots, pans, bowls and plates. Even had a Filtered water unit. Big Roku TV, maybe 65"", freshly painted. Best AirBnB experience so far. Fast WiFi too. Quiet Cul-de-sac.
Generous and quick communicator.
Great work set up at kitchen table but just a bit dark for paper file work. THAT is the only flaw. Comfortable lighting in Kitchen but for fellowship and not reading paper files. Will Stay there again, Just booked for a month. I am Happy to return here, That says it all."

However the neighbors to the right would continue to look through our windows in the middle of the night and the only way we found out was because of footsteps in the snow. It was very weird and creepy. Definitely something you should talk to them about because i will not be renting the place again, only because i feel like my safety was compromised."

They put little heart soaps on each bed with clean folded towels, they have toys for children, huge tv for entertainment. Washer and dryer is a huge plus. Fully stocked kitchen and little snack bar. This was one of my favorite vacations I’ve ever taken!
Make sure if you visit, you go to the Black rabbit coffee shop. I went every day. Eden, the barista, made the stay even better for me because she helped me with my hair for the wedding and directed me to different places. I walked to all the shops and food places from the house even though I had a rental car. The weather was gorgeous.
The view out the kitchen window made me feel like I was not even in town. This was fabulous!"

We joined in the Old Settlers festivities down town for 2 days, the new beer garden at the Abbey, boating at the new Hillsboro Lake and some 4 wheeling out in the country. It was a wonderful few days away from the City.
Being from Southern California the little bit of rain was so refreshing.

That and the facts that the bathroom doors don't lock (one of them doesn't even have a handle, it's just a hole where one should be) are the only real down side. The beds were comfortable, the bedding was clean and fresh, there were NO bugs, and the town was tiny and cute and very quiet."

We didn’t spend much time in the house but it wasn’t what I was expecting. We had to leave because of the smoke smell. We had a small child with us and we didn’t feel like any of use would be able to sleep comfortably in the home.

Stayed with a pet","The house had too much cat hair left behind and my son and I are allergic and couldn’t stay. David was very apologetic, he explained his niece was supposed to clean the house for him since it was the holidays and she apparently did a horrible job. He apologized profusely and refunded us our money since we had to go get a hotel room. I am very appreciative about how friendly he was about the situation and how quickly he resolved it and refunded us so I really can’t complain about David at all.
Cleanliness aside, the tv had no remote and wasn’t hooked up to cable so you couldn’t watch tv. There is a table and two high top chairs in the kitchen which didn’t really work for little kids."

Neighborhood peaceful and quiet even for July 4th weekend. Plenty of tv's. two bathrooms! Ceiling fans everywhere. You can't beat that.
The only thing was had a hard time with the one bathroom door. It kept falling off its track. And David's home is an older home. It has creaks and there is wear in it but I still give it 5 stars. It was perfect for me!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for my son's national Nascar Youth race at the local fairgrounds nearby. This home was perfect for the two of us. And it was near enough to our event and town eating spots that the day was never hard. When our races ended earlier than expected, Teresa was very helpful with ending our stay earlier. (We still can't figure out how to watch internet TV when someone else is logged in -- it wouldn't give us a choice to use our log-ins or theirs. But we are hooked again on Fear Factor from an online streaming, generic free channel. :) )"

The actual layout and structure was so unique and beautiful. everything was super comfortable the bed the chairs. The bathroom was spacious. The kitchen had everything you can possibly need and more and there are little details all around that make this place amazing. They think of anything you may need. We stayed here for an early trial the next day so we arrived late at night. Parking was easy and getting in the house was straight forward. I was a little upset we didn’t get there earlier to enjoy the space more we will definitely be booking this again for just a weekend escape. It’s the smallest air bnb I’ve ever booked but definitely has the most amenities of most places. Love love this place definitely stay here they deserve the money we spend for sure."

Can see that Steve put lots of thoughts when building this lovely house. The area is safe, quite, right next to a school. And it’s only 5-10min drive to wherever you want to go. Will definitely live in Steve’s house again!"

Stayed a few nights","Exceeds expectations, above and beyond; it is difficult to overstate just how great a location the Tiny Home Cabin is. Excellently designed and arranged with a comprehensive kitchen and quality appliances, despite the space limitations. Only 5 minutes from downtown Springfield, but when you're inside, you can swear you're in a cozy back woods cabin.
Steve was readily responsive to all our questions. All his communications and directions were clear and his guest book had useful information.
I cannot recommend a stay here highly enough. Should I return to Springfield, I hope to plan my trip around a stay in the Tiny Home Cabin."

He recommended The Winner’s Circle and the ribeye sandwich was delicious! This cabin that felt like a perfect home away from home. It gave me some of my own space, and my teenager his own space after exploring. I hope we can return at some point in the future! I would definitely recommend this cabin to anyone!

This modest looking cottage on the outside is extremely well-thought out on the inside, impeccably clean, super comfortable, and is well-stocked with everything one needs. This property is like “Great Wolf Lodge” meets “Tiny Homes” with a beautifully decorated lake/hunting cabin feel. When you enter, you will be amazed with a beautiful downstairs bed and linens, a fully functional kitchen and cabinet space, Wi-Fi, TV and a super clean full bath. There is a comfy upstairs loft bedroom which further gives the property the cottage feel. Steve was a super communicator and if ever in Springfield, IL again, this will be our first place to reserve. The cottage is perfect for a couple or small family to enjoy. Thank you Steve for making your property available."

He had all kinds of complimentary snacks which we enjoyed as we relaxed and watched a movie at the end of a busy day. Everything was spotlessly clean. Steve provided all the extra amenities we could possibly need. All the thoughtfulness and attention to care did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. The cabin had a cozy woods feel. It was on a quiet street but was just minutes from the downtown area where we were sightseeing. Steve was available at all times for any need we had. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Springfield area!

Encountered a deer passing through later in the evening, she seemed unbothered by me and just mosied along. Also did have a few of the complimentary snacks since they were better than my own snacks I brought....
Everything was great, hoping it won't be booked up next time I come through town! Thanks Steve and Gene (and Mark and Mosha!)."

Cozy, and he had snacks! Also we didn’t have to change linens or do anything crazy with leaving which I so appreciated - we got to relax."

The directions on how to get to the unit and how to check in were crystal clear and easy. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were very nice and seemed new. Usually I'm kind of grossed out sleeping in beds at hotels and rentals (even nice 5 star hotels), but that was not the case here at all. And the bathroom was pristine...big, clean white towels, H20 toiletries, plenty of hot water.
This rental was honestly perfect for our weekend at a local gymnastics meet. We will definitely book this again for next season's meets!"

But most of all our favorite event was this amazing beer & dessert pairing at Cypress Grove (highly recommend if they offer this again).

The gas fire pit on the porch was wonderful for the brisk evening we had. A grill was provided, which was a wonderful addition. The bed was very comfortable. We did not use the upper loft, but you could imagine that kids are teens would find it like a treehouse! Really a nice place! There was no additional bedding, and a heavy quilt on the bed would have maybe made a nice addition, you may want to bring another blanket with you, but this is definitely not to take away from the place! There are woods behind the cabin, which creates even more privacy . I felt the price point was beyond fair for what was provided. Thank you for a wonderful, wonderful wonderful stay!"

Stayed one night","The Yellow Door was absolutely perfect!! So much nicer than a hotel. It was so clean and neat. They had everything anyone would ever need. We were in town for a wedding and it was less than a mile from our destination. Bathroom was so spacious and loved the full length mirror! Bed was comfortable and the TV was huge. It had a little kitchenette even, but we didn’t need to use it. It had a comfortable couch and table. I noticed they even had games there for families to play. Will definitely stay there again and highly recommend this place! I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs and VRBOs, and this was the nicest. Host was so great to communicate with and very quick responses."

Stayed one night","Thank you very much for a wonderful stay at The Yellow Door!
The Yellow Door is an A+ in my book! My self-check-in was easy and the parking could not have been more convenient. This historic apartment was perfect and was spotlessly clean, comfortable and had everything I needed. The decor was beautiful, from the sliding barn door, stone accent wall and wood paneled ceiling. I really appreciated the comfortable bed, kitchenette and sofa. The lavender scented body wash and argan oil products were a really nice touch as well!
Next time I am in town, I would love to stay at your place again and visit some of the local sites including beautiful Lake Shelbyville, the quaint downtown area and local shops and eateries! The people I met in town were some of the nicest I have met anywhere. :-)
Until next time,
Gina C."

It was also a very peaceful location with top floor window views overlooking rooftops throughout the small town of Moweaqua ❤️ I watched a squirrel carry a cookie on the neighboring roof which was sort of funny. The bathtub was extremely deep and relaxing especially since Robin provided salts for her guests. My host was more than hospitable. Not only did she leave my favorite bottle of wine but she also gifted me some fresh eggs, cookies and a gift card for a local restaurant. Would recommend to anyone! 5 stars ❤️ thank you Robin."

It was so clean, so cute and just what I needed after a long day of standing outside and talking to people at a trade show! Robin and Mark gave the place so many personal touches, like fresh flowers in a vase next to the bed, comfy bedding, fresh cookies -- even fresh eggs! Staying in Moweaqua reminded me of my childhood growing up in a small town. Quiet, clean, peaceful and super quaint. I really enjoyed going for walks in the friendly small-town atmosphere. I slept like a baby, which I can't say for most of my other business trips. I'd recommend Robin's Nest to anyone who needs a place to stay in the Decatur/Moweaqua area!"

She reached out with instructions and asked questions to help make our stay as comfortable as possible. I traveled with young kids, and she made sure there were amenities for them, much to their delight. We had kind of a hectic/stressful situation with family, and I so appreciated her extra care in making sure we were comfortable. It was truly a retreat just when we needed one. For many years we wanted to visit the area but there wasn’t a place locally to stay, so I’m so thankful to find such a perfect place for us to stay when we come back. I highly recommend this adorable, unique and pristine apartment."

We picked up lunch (fried chicken) another day at the grocery store one block the other direction. Did not try the Thai restaurant or coffee shop that are just steps away, next time:) Went to both antique shops on Main Street and found some treasures. Moweaqua is a charming small town. We hope to stay at Robin's again when in central Illinois."

I could have packed so much lighter had I known she literally had EVERYTHING. My kids loved ""their"" room with the two beds, she even left age appropriate things for my kids to do.
Deborah was in contact right up to check in to make sure everything we needed was addressed and followed up with me upon checking out. Detailed instructions for check out were easily available leaving no guess work as we were trying to leave.

Stayed a few nights","This place is great! The guest cottage was super cute, spacious, and private. The bed is extremely comfortable and Barbara provided everything we needed for our stay. Due to flight delays, we got in around 2AM but she left the door open and the lights on for us. If you are visiting Taylorville, I highly recommend this over any other option."

Stayed a few nights","If you're looking for a quite, cozy place to stay with nice scenery then look no further! Barbara's place was perfect for my boyfriend and I who were in town for a music festival. The bed was very cozy. The place had adjustable A/C that worked well. There is a microwave and a mini fridge with a roomy freezer. The TV had all the popular streaming services available to use. Our parking spot was the driveway. Her back patio is absolutely gorgeous and so peaceful! We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","It's a very comfortable space, especially the bed. I have fibromyalgia and insomnia and I haven't slept that well in years. If you're afraid of dogs know that they can't get to you through the fence but they are inches away. Also, the seating is very comfortable. We spent 4 nights there, just to get away. We watched movies and binge streamed tv. Our concern was seating comfort, and it did not disappoint. The host was also very accommodating with us wanting to cook our meals. There was a microwave, coffee maker, and mini fridge, but she let us bring our electric skillet. Cooking space was limited but we made it work. Overall, a very relaxing extended weekend."

Everything looks fresh and new. Nice comfy bed with plenty of pillows. The temperature control system works great and is easy to use. I recommend the Market Street Guest Cottage for a couple or individual."

Stayed a few nights","The host was quick to communicate and everything is as pictured. There are just two things to note;
One is that the rather large dogs come right up to the gate barking loudly. If you are afraid of dogs be aware.
The windows do not open & there is no exhaust fan, so after showers be careful walking on the stone tile floors. We found them a bit slippery.
All in all it was a good 3 day stay."

Barbara has magical wind chimes in her backyard and they played me to sleep each night. Barbara was flexible with check-in, which I am thankful for - I was up visiting family and not operating on my own timeline. She was graceful with my scattered communication. I hope to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","If your travels take you to Taylorville and you need a place to stay, this is a wonderful option! We had a large group of relatives visiting my elderly parents and wanted to save them the stress of having too many overnight guests. This little cottage was just perfect! The owner has two big, cute dogs who were peeking out the window of the main house - they were our welcome wagon as we came and went back and forth. When we first walked in, we ooohed and ahhhed over the cheerful blue and white color scheme. The set-up has everything you could need - a great bathroom, sitting area, and the most comfortable bed we’ve ever slept in! Even in the dead gray of a midwestern winter, the property is beautiful and welcoming. I’d love to see it in the spring! We will absolutely stay here again!"

Great small touches in the place to make it feel special. Host was there to greet us. Wonderful host.
