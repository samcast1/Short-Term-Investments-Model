Stayed a few nights",Sweet cute cottage. Felt as comfortable as staying at grandma’s house. Close enough to enjoy Waco attractions and far enough to feel like a getaway. It was a perfect place to prepare for and after our half marathon. The animals were great 🙂

Stayed a few nights","we stayed here for two nights and absolutely loved it! i am a city slicker - don't know a llama from an alpaca and am really wanting to spend more time around farm animals now. the animals were all so fun to watch and listen to - there was a lot of rain on our second day and we sat for hours on the porch and watched neighboring horses just mill around. lovely. the kitchen and bathrooms were spotless, the beds comfortable and the living room well appointed for curling up and talking or watching TV. would reserve this home again anytime i was in waco."

Stayed with kids","This place is quiet and peaceful. The home has everything you need to accommodate your stay. Plenty of towels, and well stocked kitchen. Watching the sunset from the porch was definitely a favorite part of our stay. THE FARM ANIMALS! Lucy the Llama was such a delight, as were all the goats and their babies. The geese randomly waddle through the yard letting you know they are there. The neighboring horses are also very friendly and will allow you to feed them grass, and pet their heads. You can walk the street as there is very little traffic, and it is very safe. If you take an evening stroll you will find views of the lake, miniature donkeys, and a miniature pony down the street from the home. Such a delightful retreat here in Waco. Close enough to town for anything you need, yet in a country quiet setting. It was just what we needed!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Josh's Rustic Farmhouse was just perfect. The house was very comfortable. The kitchen was awesome...big refrigerator; very nice stove; wonderful pantry with essentials for cooking; very nice dishwasher and lovely back porch for eating and visiting with friends while watching the farm animals.
We loved sitting and having coffee on the front porch rocking on the rocking chairs. Loved walking the lane in front of the house and admiring the beautiful homes and neighboring horses. The farm animals were the highlight of our trip even though our trip was to visit Magnolia. Josh was Johnny-on-the-spot with his responses to any questions we had. My friend who I was concerned about staying in the country said if I ever come back to Waco, I want to stay here. Lucy the Llama, Harry the horse as well as the ""bully"" goat with the beautiful blue eyes highlight our memories. Thank you, Josh, for a wonderful trip."

Stayed with kids","Our stay far exceeded our expectations. Josh was beyond kind, welcoming and helpful. He let us roam his farm as we pleased and interact with any and all of his friendly farm animals. Even more, Josh joined us on two occasions and helped our young kids learn about and better engage with his animals. It created priceless memories for our family.
The house was super clean, and both the front and back porches were as relaxing as it gets. The location is close enough to Waco to enjoy other attractions, but far enough outside of the city to be in the country. I would highly recommend this stay. Thank you Josh for a wonderful experience!"

If you visit during the spring, you might get the added bonus of the cutest baby goats! The house was cozy and had everything we needed. It's about 20 minutes into downtown Waco but only 10 minutes to stores if you need to pick anything up. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path."

Stayed a few nights","Josh was extremely nice and communicated well. He even offered to let us check in a little early.
The place was ideal for our needs! The pastoral views from the kitchen were especially lovely! There are chickens, geese, goats (some adorable baby goats), one alpaca and a horse behind the back fence. Josh had a container with food to feed the chickens and geese. All come running when you’re at the back fence.
We were in Waco for the Homestead Heritage Fair so we didn’t get to sit on the porch in the rocking chairs; maybe next time. And, there’s a nice back deck with a table and chairs also.
The Mammoth site is just down the road and we were within 20 to 30 minutes of everything we needed to get to.
There were four of us counting my son and daughter in law and we had plenty of room; plus they brought their dog. The beds were very comfortable!
We hope to stay again!"

My kids' favorite part was hanging out with the exceptionally friendly goats, chickens, and horse just over the fence line! Will definitely keep visit again!!!"

Just to spend time with my mom, drink coffee, read my book, and watch the animals. We did spend some time in Waco doing a few things, but to be honest, I was so happy and at peace to just sit on the front porch or back patio and just, be. The goats are adorable and the chickens are so clever. The speckled hen was my favorite! She’s very talkative and will eat from your hand. Loved the house! Immaculate and cozy. Would definitely book again the next time I need a break from life!"

Stayed with a pet","Josh's airbnb and farm property were outstanding and idyllic. We were coming from the hustle & bustle of Austin and needed to relax during a long holiday weekend. Josh's Airbnb offered the perfect setting to enjoy the beautiful Texas night sky, sleep in comfy clean beds, visit with their sweet farm animals (we even got to welcome two baby goats born on the night we arrived!), play board games, pick up great tacos at El Norteño, go to nearby parks... and all while being just a short drive into downtown Waco. The Big Plus was that Josh and his family welcomed our dog on the property ~ and even offered to provide a doggie crate.
PS: We weren't very familiar with downtown Waco but the town boasts wonderful farm to table restaurants, fun indie bookstores & boutiques and of course, the stunning Magnolia Market."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely peaceful! We recently stayed during the New Year's weekend. From the moment we stepped on the property until the moment we left, Josh was the best host. He was kind, responsive, and very helpful. I now understand why so many of the reviews spoke of the animals. As soon as we arrived, we couldn't help but rush over to meet them. Feed was left on the patio table and we couldn't wait to feed them. My husband and I were looking for a place to get away and have some downtime. This place was just perfect for that. We loved the outdoor sounds of animals and New Year's fireworks in the distance. We grilled and enjoyed the fire pit. Josh even provided us with the firewood. The house itself was quaint and simple. There was plenty of room to enjoy the t.v. and the quiet time indoors. Everything we needed from kitchen items to bathroom linens was available. It was just my husband and I, but a family of more than two would be just as comfortable there too. We can't wait to return!"

We wake to the most breathtaking sunrise over the farm and it’s the perfect place to unwind after a busy day. The farm animals are such an added bonus and enjoy little visits from house guests.
Josh’s home is clean and comfortable, and has all the amenities needed to make this a home away from home. Plus, a very comfortable bed which is a must for us.
We will continue to book this beautiful, quaint home every time we visit our family in Waco.
Thank you Josh for hosting us again. Loved our visit."

We actually brought our own food but did go for a coffee run at one of the local spots. We played monopoly several times during the weekend and it was such a life saver.

While we stayed at the house, we took a horseback ride at Brazos Bluffs Ranch (it was amazing!!). It was only 10-15 mins away. The homestead heritage market nearby is also very nice. We also took a walk in the morning and really enjoyed it.
This is a great place and we hope to come back!"

Joe was a wonderful host. He treated us very accommodating. He wasn't in any case at all, but always on hand if we needed him.
For us, the location was wonderful! Rural, calm yet well developed. We love coffee. From Airbnb, numerous coffee shops can be reached in minutes. But we also liked staying in Airbnb and outside. We were able to relax wonderfully.
Looking for a nice and quiet place to stay, a weekend in Swiss style, or cozy days in a good atmosphere, this Airbnb is wonderfully suited!
We were really happy! 😊"

The Haus was beautifully decorated and so many details. It was warm and inviting with everything we needed. The closed in porch made for a cozy place to sit with coffee in the morning or a cocktail at night. The beds were quite possibly the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in and the linens so soft and inviting.
The property was gorgeous and well maintained (I almost asked if I could ride the riding lawnmower). We did see Joe during our stay but never felt our encounters to be intrusive-truth be told he seems like a gentleman we’d love to sit and chat with and boy can we!
The Haus was the perfect getaway for these busy moms to just sit and enjoy one another’s company uninterrupted. We will definitely be back! We are already looking at our calendars for the fall."

The location was perfect, not far from I-35 so everything in Waco was easily accessible and quick to get to while also being far enough from town to truly unplug and unwind. Joe was very helpful and pleasant to interact with and even gave excellent recommendations on restaurants and especially coffee shops in the area and throughout Waco. I have stayed in other AIr B&Bs that were decent but this outshone them all for the convenience and peace of the location, as well as the the cleanliness and beauty which made this place and experience an incredible value. I couldn’t imagine recommending anything else for a visit to the Waco area."

We ran into some car troubles and Joe really helped us out with a mechanic. Once we finally got that sorted and were leaving , Joe prayed for our safe travels which was so sweet - we are very appreciative of his hospitality during our trip.

Stayed one night","My girlfriends and I stayed for 1 night to celebrate my birthday, and we were all so amazed at how soft the sheets were and how comfortable the beds were. (Two of my friends are pregnant, so being comfortable in a bed is no small order!)
I may be a bit biased as I was involved in the design of this airbnb, but I have not been involved on the hosting side of things since it opened up, and I wanted to experience it as a guest firsthand to make sure everything was going well.
I have to say….I am very proud of how Joe (my father in law) has created wonderful systems to make staying here a breeze!
It smelled AMAZINGGGG when I walked inside. Fresh and clean and crisp. His wonderful housekeeper does an A++ job making sure the beds are fresh, the coffee is stocked, and everything is immaculate upon arrival!
To design a space is one thing. To operate a business is another thing entirely. Joe has done an amazing job! (I’m a proud daughter-in law)
My one critique: there was no sugar or honey to sweeten the coffee. I’m a bit of a wimp and take my coffee sweeet! After a quick chat, he brought some sugar over and I was able to have some coffee with my sugar! ;)
10/10 recommend this guest haus for your next stay.

The place was extremely clean, and we appreciated all the snacks and coffee in the kitchen. The back deck was also beautiful to spend time in both late at night around the fire and early in the morning over coffee. Joe was also a wonderful host, quick to answer any of our questions over text.

They have thought of everything you might need during your stay and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable - including some of the softest sheets I’ve ever felt.
Communication prior to our arrival was incredibly helpful. We knew exactly what to expect when we arrived. Joe was available if we needed anything during our stay. I really appreciate they have a later check out (11) so we didn’t have to rush out the door in the morning.
You HAVE to enjoy the back patio with a fire, sunset, and a glass of wine or a mug of hot chocolate. It’s dreamy!"

Recommendations would be to place a label on the front door key pad entry device informing occupant to turn the small deadbolt below the keypad after entering the code. Also, place a label on the porch fire pit informing occupant that the lighting instructions are in the closed compartment area below. Joe was an excellent host. On a few occasions we contacted him with questions and he responded immediately with accurate and concise answers. All in all, this is a real winner as a comfortable BnB. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to have a special quiet country time away, while still being easily accessible to the city. The Swiss decor theme for this BnB is spot on. Thank you Joe for a very special and relaxing stay."

They felt high in the trees. The deck was great and offered relaxing views. The location was quiet, even with kids excited to feed the miniature horse. We enjoyed making a fire to make smores. We enjoyed the sound of the running water from the creek. Garry and Tammy were very responsive and friendly. The location was not far from all the fun Waco destinations. Definitely would come back to this treehouse."

Stayed a few nights","Great little gem tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city but so close to everything we needed. The surprisingly expansive hideaway of the 3 treehouses behind Tammy and Coach's home was amazing! I would imagine it would be a bit tricky to find the place if you were showing up after dark though. But Tammy gave great instructions on how to navigate their unique little ""neighborhood.""
Our family had a much needed, quiet and peaceful stay to unwind from work and before the boys went back to school.
Our 3 boys really enjoyed exploring the property! We were greeted by Chocolate Chip, the house horse! That was absolutely thrilling for my boys!
The house was so well set up and cozy with such great attention to the smallest details.
We were originally booked to for the Coach's Quarter house but Tammy suggested since we were a family of 5 we'd be more comfortable in the Clubhouse. It was perfect!
We will definitely be back again....when it's cooler and the river is flowing!
Thanks"

The treehouse is also close to Cameron Park, a refreshing park to get out and enjoy a walk or bike ride. Additionally, you will have Cameron Park Zoo located next to the park, Magnolia Market, and last but not least there is a variety of places to eat within minutes of the treehouse.

I love how the have a recommendation list of their favorite places to eat. Definitely made it easier on us!! Gary saw that we have 2 little boys so he decided to take them on a tour of the prooerty to meet some horses whice was totally unexpected but a great treat!!! We had a small issue with parking because we have a 40ft trailer with us but they did not hesitate to find us a solution. They have a total of 3 tree houses next to each other so we will definitely be back with family all the way from Florida!! Thanks Gary and Tammy!!!"

The location was close to downtown Waco and everything we wanted to do. Gary and Tammy’s recommendations were on point, we didn’t have a single bad meal the whole trip!
Only thing to note is that the bathroom privacy was a slight issue. The doors to the bathroom were more like shutter doors than actual doors. With the mirror placement if anyone was showering/getting ready we could see them! We fixed this by hanging a blanket over the door to cover the mirror’s reflection.

The minis on the property are adorable and friendly and were so sweet and playful with Sam the shepherd ….also sweet and friendly! We couldn’t recommend this highly enough and will be back again one day ourselves!

The treehouse very comfortably accommodated all four of us. It has all the amenities of traditional AirBnBs. You won’t really be cooking but bring snacks, drinks, and Door Dash delivers there. The outside decks are inviting. The beds are super comfortable. The loft area is really cute. One of the best places we’ve stayed and w3’ll be back!"

The trees and natural landscape are so beautiful and serene that we never wanted to leave the space. We happened across Gary and Tammy’s listing and immediately knew we wanted to stay here! The space is super clean and the bed is so comfy! Every detail about the treehouse was thoughtfully implemented to create a very memorable experience. The miniature horses Oreo & Chocolate Chip are the honorary greeters and they reminded us of fairy horses in a secluded woodland ready to make friends who happen on their home.
We got to meet Gary-the owner- and we throughly enjoyed chatting with him the morning of our departure. We told him we would definitely be back when we visit Waco again!!!
Thank you Gary & Tammy for allowing us to stay in your gorgeous & homey Treehouse!!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't imagine a better place to stay in Waco! First, it was off in the wooded back-yard acreage of a VERY upscale neighborhood, along a beautiful creek. We felt so secluded, yet very safe. The pictures show you how beautiful the place is. They had the fridge stocked with drinks, and the counter stocked with snacks. The 3 beds were comfortable. We met Gary twice as he came to feed horses. He even offered (and we accepted) a tour of the pastures on his Kawasaki Mule. We got to see their 5 day old longhorn and 10 day old mini horse! Their dog, Sam was a ham, stealing the alfalfa cubes from the horses. We felt like we were staying with old friends. It was a fantastic experience!

Our younger son had a great time running around, petting the miniature ponies, and playing cornhole while we had a relaxing spot to visit with our older daughters. It was only about 15-17 minutes to campus and we loved having a quiet, beautiful spot to come back to. The lodging is fun, our son thought staying in a treehouse was cool, but for the adults it was also very comfortable and Gary and Tammy had thought of lots of little touches to make us even more comfortable (coffee, waters, snacks, soaps). Very clean. Very comfortable beds. Overall a fantastic stay for our family."

It has been near impossible to relax in 2021, and the four days my husband and I spent at the tree house were the most peaceful of our life. The location is great and extremely close to several shops, restaurants, and gas stations. It was extremely clean and more than we expected. The shower is amazing and the hot water is outstanding. My favorite place is outside on the deck, there is barely any street noise and all you can hear is nature noises. We came for a wedding and only had one day to explore Waco and chose to actually spend it at the treehouse. Finally, chocolate chip and Oreo were such an amazing additional perk. They were so sweet and we loved getting to meet them. Thank you Tammy and Gary for the perfect weekend."

The wrap-around porches with lovely seating areas are a heavenly place to relax with a cup of coffee while listening to the song birds. The accommodations are magnificent with truly comfortable beds, lovely bedding all around, loft and great room with spectacular windows with zebra blinds, huge rain shower area with sparkling shades of blue tile, fantastic AC, Keurig coffee maker and snacks provided that my grandchildren loved, two fascinating miniature horses, and high-end details all around.

We received great instructions on how to find the treehouse and check in was super easy. We stayed during the heat of the summer and the downstairs portion of the treehouse remained very cool and comfortable with the air conditioning unit on. The loft area was more difficult to keep cool. There is one small personal fan the owners have provided for the loft, but it cannot point at both beds at the same time. We were still able to sleep upstairs, but it definitely does not cool off like the main area. The owners did a great job with the craftsmanship of the treehouse. We had a fantastic overall stay, and the lights at night make the treehouse pretty dreamy!"

Stayed with kids","This is without a doubt the coolest AirBnB we have ever stayed at. The amazing Tammy and Coach have created something truly magical. Coach's Quarters by the Creek is stunning in every way. To quote our 6 year old's vocabulary, this getaway is ""epic, extraordinary, next level, and wonderful."" That last one really resonates because every thoughtful inch has been handmade and designed by a beautiful couple full of love and wonder. From the homeplate at the base of the ramp that makes you feel like a winner every time you step on it, to the gorgeous views of the enchanting neighborhood with a flowing creek clear enough to spot the little fish swimming by, to the relevantly designed gym wood floors, to the artistic mosaics, to the luxurious rain shower, to the whimsical indoor ""outhouse"", to the perfectly Feng shui'd and uber comfortable furniture, to the masterfully placed windows that maximize natural light and achieve serene privacy, to the charming, character filled knickknacks and heartwarming decorations, this family designed and built custom treehouse is truly the epitome of wonderful.
Yet if that wasn't enough, on the property are two of the friendliest miniature pony sisters, Chocolate Chip and Oreo. They followed our daughter and loved on her from the very first minute she stepped out of the car. Then there's the sweet treehouse pup, Sam, who loves the back rubs and makes sure everyone is safe and well. Lastly and most importantly, you have the most gracious, passionate, and deserving hosts you can find. The level of artistry, passion, discipline, precision, elegance, and joy that Tammy is famous for delivering with her choirs is quite tangibly present and alive in her treehouse.
Honestly the only negative thing is that this place is pretty much booked every weekend in the foreseeable future, but if you can snatch up some dates, don't hesitate. It is worth every penny, and it is still incredibly underpriced. Most treehouses in Texas are at least double what this rare gem is being listed as, and that won't last long because AirBnB controls part of the price regulation so book your next getaway here as fast as you can!"

Everything you’d need to feel pampered and taken care of. Softest sheets and towels, lovely neighborhood, super comfortable bed. We would definitely stay again if we returned to Waco!"

The accommodations are pristine and comfortable - exactly as pictured and described - offering everything we need/want. Our hosts tend to the small but meaningful details, including motion-activated path lighting. They manage to be non-intrusive but warm and friendly all at the same time - a difficult line to walk! We appreciate Barkley House and the gracious hospitality we enjoy there."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at the Barkley house for one night on a work trip. The airbnb is a private questhouse behind a home. This was my first stay in an Airbnb, and I was nervous because I’m a very private person. I travel for work and my nephew encouraged me to try something new.
I could’ve easily missed the property, but Michele’s directions made it easy to find. The neighborhood is lovely. It was less than a five minute drive from work, and near the lake, hospitals and shopping centers. To access the airbnb you have to climb stairs. This is clearly depicted in the pictures, but I’m pointing this out for travelers who may have heavy luggage or mobility issues. Accessing the place was easy; there’s a coded keypad on the door that was easy to use. The space was beautiful. It’s one large room which was plenty for my needs. It was clean, uncluttered and smelled nice. The water pressure in the shower was great, linens comfortable. The internet was spotty, but didn’t bother me much. Overall great stay."

The bed was soft and warm with plenty of extra blankets, the bathroom towels were clean and luxurious, and the entire space was calm and well-designed. Plenty of natural light during the day, and blinds and curtains for the night-time. Excellent location, too! I also appreciated having the iron and ironing board to touch up my clothes. And a nice assortment of coffee K-cups to start the day. Michele has created a gem, and I will definitely stay at Barkley House next time I'm in Waco, TX."

Scrambling at the last minute to find another option Michele's treehouse/backhouse was available and I am SO thankful. She was quick to respond and make accommodations for my nearly immediate arrival. The space is adorable, incredibly comfortable, decorated in a thoughtful way without clutter. The washer and dryer are a major bonus, the wifi is great, and the bed is a literal cloud. Lastly, I caught Michele on my way out and she is such a delight. I can't wait to stay here again!"

You will walk through her yard and thru her fence to get to the garage in the back. Michele and her husband were home each day when we came in and out but respected our privacy, which we appreciated. They were very kind and hospitable. In the apartment is a toaster oven, keurig, fridge, microwave, and washer and dryer. There are more than enough dishes and silverware available. Michele thoughtfully provided make up remover wipes, toiletries, k-cups, tea, coffee creamer, snacks and water bottles. Overall, the apartment was very clean, well-appointed, and comfortable enough for me and my husband to spend 6 days here! Michele was easy to communicate with and very responsive. I would not hesitate to recommend Michelle or her place!"

We were able to visit multiple coffee places such as Dichotomy, and Fabled book and cafe - we also had brunch at Cafe Cappuccino as well as Crickets, enjoyed a fancy dinner at Taste by Kissing Tree Vineyards, and capped off our evenings at two awesome breweries - Waco Ale and Southern Roots. We ended our stay with a morning run around the Brazos and the suspension bridge. Michele was kind, helpful, and hospitable. If we return to Waco, we'll return to the Barkley House."

After reading reviews about hotels off 35 not having safe parking lots after dark and hotels smelling musty… I jumped over to Airbnb& found this little gem for the same price for 1 night stay.
2 females just needing a safe, quiet place to sleep and this met our expectations. Clean, quiet, safe and all that we needed! I would say a lounging chair would be a great addition but I understand it would crowd the space. Such a cute, well thought out use of space & very clean!

Stayed about a week","We stayed 8 days. Checked in and had to wait for 2 women cleaning up.
Shocked to find no place to hang up my suit and dress clothes. No dresser ..needed a place for my folded clothes.
Needs a couch or comfortable seating.. only the bed or 2 metal chairs. I had to do a lot of study and research and the kitchen table was inadequate especially because no good reading or study lamp.
These are only my suggestions. If most people only stay one ir two nights, maybe okay but i was there 8 nights."

Stayed a few nights","Despite having a hiccup when I arrived, Cameron & Danielle made sure I was taken care of. Their home & neighborhood (just like Waco, in general) is a little old & worn but that's what gives it its character. The neighborhood isn't the nicest but after pulling into the driveway & having my own space to park & walk into, all my worries disappeared. I came on this trip alone & not once did I feel unsafe in their home. I loved that their home was so close to everything & downtown! Bed was super comfy & it was nice to be able to watch tv after a long day. It was super hot in Waco & the AC worked perfectly. Shower pressure wasn't the best but did it's job. The room was nice, clean, quiet & quaint. I also got a lucky chance to meet the dog, didn't catch his name, he was too busy chasing squirrels running up trees but he was super friendly. Thank you for making my visit welcoming. I loved this little space & would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had a great stay at Cameron’s place! We were in Waco for my graduation at Baylor and it was a great spot to stay to be close to downtown and the Baylor campus. Their home has everything that we needed and for the price was a great deal!
One of the things I really appreciated was the fridge had filtered water. I’ve been to many Airbnb’s that don’t have that, and it was great to not have to buy water.
Another great amenity was having AC and a fan in the home. We visited when it was 106 degrees!! But the AC held up and worked perfectly! The unit can be a little confusing to navigate so it may be useful to get instructions from the hosts.
The only thing to note is we did have some issues with the shower being inconsistent with the hot and cold temperatures. However, the hosts were informed of this issue and are responsive and seem dedicated to resolve any problems.
Overall our stay was great and I would 100% recommend to anyone looking to visit Waco ☺️"

Decorating style was cozy and minimalist. Appreciated the kettle & easy log-ins to streaming devices. Two parking spaces were provided & about a 10 minute drive to downtown. Contacted host since one towel was provided and she responded quickly. Noticed hair on comforter and bed sheets (informed host). When collecting towels from dryer, I saw clean sheets and changed them myself. Unit smelled like bug spray (informed host) & had to spray some perfume to mask the smell. Unfortunately, the bug spray didn’t seem to work since beetles were coming inside the unit. We killed about 10 beetles that evening, as well as flies/gnats."

It is so close to everything! I was at Baylor, parks or the Silos in minutes. Room was nice and bed was very comfy. Almost anything you might need was there except there isn't any place to hang up your clothes and no drawers so everything stayed in the suitcase for the week. I don't want to sound picky but future guest should know that detail. Cameron was very accommodating to my schedule and I really appreciated it. All in all I can honestly say that I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again!"

By the time I realized it wasn’t pushing out cold air it was a bit late and I wasn’t able to get a response from the hosts. Other than that it was a nice studio Airbnb.

The place was spotless and it was perfect for us just passing through and needing a clean, comfy space. The bed was so comfy and we heard zero noise from the main house. Highly recommend!"

it’s so much better than staying in motels. No echos of slamming doors or people walking down the halls talking. The host, the room and accommodations were excellent. I was five minutes driving time to down town where I needed to be. Next year I may have to return to Waco and I’m hoping I will be able to stay at Cameron’s Air B&B. What else can I say. Just Excellent!"

The walk downtown to Austin Avenue was only 20 minutes for us.

Group trip","Great location to downtown Waco. It is in the portion of Waco that is slowly being revitalized. We are from Waco so very familiar with area. You can literally sit on the balcony and or downstairs patio and listen to The Backyard’s entertainment they have for the evening (but if inside it doesn’t bother you). We rented it for wedding weekend for my daughter and her bridal party. It was perfect! Well stocked, plenty of inside and outside amenities to enjoy. The patio area is amazing. Also, know for sleeping arrangements since there are no single beds you can easily fit as big of an air mattress you need. One king bed is downstairs and one is upstairs. Then you have the pullout sofa. Overall an amazing place and I will recommend to clients and would rent again."

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect place for 2 couples to stay and the kitchen was awesome. We had a little trouble figuring out how to lock the door but that was more user error and they were very responsive and ready to send someone if needed. If you're staying to visit the Silo's you couldn't pick a better place for location and comfort.
Keep in mind WACO is a noisy town with active train tracks right thru the middle of town but you can't go wrong with this vacation home."

The only downside is that for such a big place it’s a two bedroom, and the tvs were smaller than I would like. Neither of these in any way hindered my stay, just the only bummer. I would highly recommend this place to anybody! Great host! Great place!"

Great outdoor space and amenities. Appreciated built-in bottle filler with filtered water right in the kitchen. It's definitely an up and coming area, but you're so close to Magnolia that you can overlook the under-construction and the need to be under construction homes in the neighborhood."

It’s very clean and beautifully decorated. People drive by and stare at it which can be a little awkward, but I couldn’t really blame them. Some features we loved… the water station, the Keurig coffee maker, the snacks and cereal, and all the outdoor seating.
It didn’t really bother us, but you can hear music and the neighbors if they are loud.
Thanks for letting us stay at The Wishing House! - The Wantlands and The Shivers"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Wishing House was perfect. It all began with excellent communication. They were prompt in responding to all of our questions and were accommodating with our arrival. We especially loved that they presented us with a file of places to eat and visit while we were in Waco.
The house itself was lovely. There wasn’t anything missed. The decor and attention to detail left us feeling more comfortable then any upscale hotel.
The location was perfectly located in the silo district. Several restaurants and shopping were all within walking distance.
The only recommendation to those staying at the Wishing House would be to consider renting a car if you didn’t drive. There is still a lot to see in the Waco area, and having a vehicle to get around would be helpful. (We used Uber which was easily available, but not as handy)
We would highly recommend staying at the Wishing House. (We got some great decor ideas even within these four walls!). Enjoy!"

I'm an OCD germaphobe, so I am extremely grateful!! The instructions were crystal clear, and host responsiveness exceeded any expectations we could have had. The location was super convenient to activities, so you really don't need a car if you plan to stay in downtown Waco. We felt safe as not much foot traffic. With exception to an occasional train or weekend music on occassion from Backyard Grill, the location is extremely quiet and peaceful. And, they have ear plugs if you're a bit sound sensitive or a light sleeper. They truly thought of everything, so we really felt like it was home away from home. We were able to relax and work without being in each other's way. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were spoiled. It will be painful to stay in a hotel going forward, and the bar is extremely high for all other Airbnb's and their hosts. Thank you Bethany and Andrea for a phenomenal experience in Waco!!"

It was nice to see both parts of the house. It felt so peaceful and was a wonderful place to relax. I really enjoyed being able to read in the upstairs rooms in the house when my husband and I wanted a little separate time to do whatever we wanted. We stayed in the main bedroom downstairs in the house. It’s a great split floor plan. I was excited about the piano from pictures, but it’s only for decoration, so you can’t play it. My favorite place aesthetically is the kitchen. My favorite place to relax in the house is the upstairs room with the white board flooring."

We were tickled by the tour vans that would drive by. The neighborhood is beautiful, peaceful and easy to get to.
We enjoyed being in the city where we could use Instacart and DoorDash as needed. The grandchildren (age 18 mo & two 3 1/2 yr olds) really enjoyed the Mayborn Museum. My kids said it was the best children’s museum they have ever been to. Another fun outing was to a nearby splash pad and playground.

Stayed with kids","I can’t even begin to share how WONDERFUL of an experience we had in this home. It was everything it described and soooooo much more! The hosts were fantastic, the location is convenient and the home is beyond gorgeous and sparking clean!
We surprised hubby with a stay there for Father’s Day and he was blown away! And of course, we just had to watch the actual episode on Fixer Upper while sitting in the kitchen 🤣
You’ll have a grand old time, the home makes you feel you’re at home, the house it stunning and the hosts are extremely pleasant to work with.
We will return soon as we think we’ve found a little piece of Heaven with this house. We wish we would have booked for a longer stay.♥️
Thanks to Jeff and Sara for being amazing m, and sharing your incredible lodging with the community."

The beds were wonderful to sleep on, and the AC kept the space all nice and cool as Texas was experiencing extreme heat advisory notices. The back garden has tables and is a great space to have friends and family around for an evening outdoor meal.
Thank you for such a memorable weekend in Waco!"

Stayed one night","It was really cool to stay in an actual Fixer Upper house that Chip and Joanna had worked on! The main area they remodeled was absolutely beautiful! And what they couldn’t remodel was painted and refreshed and looked very nice! It’s an older house obviously, but it was the experience we were there for.
It was very clean and well appointed! Very roomy and lots of rooms for sleeping! The beds were comfy and we enjoyed our stay!
Something to know that surprised us a little was that they also rent out a cottage that is right behind the house. It was not a problem at all and we didn’t see anyone. But just know that the cottage is right outside the back door, almost like a detached garage. It never posed an issue of any kind and we didn’t see the people that were staying there at all. But they would be walking up the driveway past the kitchen window if they were there. Not a deal breaker at all, just a heads up so you aren’t surprised!!
I wish we had time to watch the episode of Fixer Upper but we were only there one night and were exhausted from our early morning flight and the day spent at Magnolia.
Make reservations at Magnolia Table way ahead of time! It is amazing!! Absolutely delicious!! Highly recommend!!
All around great stay! Would stay again!!"

Stayed a few nights","Jeff & Sara’s house is a great place to stay in Waco, especially for larger groups! The location is quiet and relatively close to many amenities. The kitchen and living are the nicest and best parts of the home, and it was enjoyable to spend time there. The one main criticism I have after staying there is that I feel like the bathrooms could use some updating to bring them up to the same level as the rest of the home. The bathrooms are clean and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with them, but they just fall flat compared to the rest of the house (they feel more like you’re in a clean, but slightly outdated home, rather than any sort of vacation retreat). Overall, I would recommend this property if you’re a fan of Fixer Upper or want to stay in a larger home in Waco!"

Stayed with kids","It was a beautiful house, but we would not stay here again. We did wobble between giving it 3 or 4 stars for reasons that I privately messaged the owner about, one that is a deal breaker for our family. If Jeff and Sara fix these issues, this would be a great place to stay, and they seem like excellent hosts. As is, we feel we definitely overpaid for the issues we had to deal with. Hopefully they will be addressed in the future.
Pros: Fixer Upper fame and great location to Waco activities and shops
Con: uneven temperature distribution in the house and a lack of privacy, as well as privately discussed problems"

We enjoyed everything about our visit to Waco and all agreed that getting to come back to such a special home, during our down times, was one of the highlights. Throwing on sweats and curling up on the couch to watch episode 9 of season 3...you have to watch the episode of Fixer Upper while you are there! We kept pausing it to stop and look around at the real thing. The home is so welcoming and set up so comfortably. We made sure to cook some dinners at the house and enjoyed eating together around the dining room table. We did the Waco Tour towards the end of our stay, but highly recommend it for doing at the beginning of your stay, if possible. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked, check-in was a breeze and our hosts were super nice. You won't regret making this part of your stay in Waco. We definitely didn't!"

Group trip","We have stayed here twice; once last year and once this year. It’s a pretty penny but worth the great stay! You can split the price with a big group/family. Magnolia Silos and Magnolia Table aren’t too far away, which is where we visited on our trip. It’s always fun to watch the Fixer-Upper episode in the house! The house is styled very nicely, is clean, has a valuable kitchen space, many rooms, bathrooms, big backyard and amenities. The only downsides were that the back door is difficult to shut/lock, driveway is a little tight, upstairs old wooden floors tend to be noisy and the downstairs master’s bathroom’s main lights don’t turn on. For us, not huge deal breakers. Other than that, worth the stay and hope to come again on our next trip to Waco!"

The home is immaculate, although there is some normal wear and tear. The kitchen was well stocked to make meals with ease. We thoroughly enjoyed using the kitchen to cook! Jeff was super responsive to minor issues encountered and even stopped by to help out. The beds are very comfortable! (Master bed higher than upstairs beds). My family and I enjoyed a week long stay and we were very happy with the space the house offered and the proximity to all Magnolia related things. Tour busses/tourists passed daily, multiple times. Can’t blame them. All in all, a wonderful experience and family memories made that will be cherished forever. Jeff is truly a pleasure to deal with and great to talk to!

Group trip",7 girls stayed here to visit magnolia for a bachelorette weekend getaway. The house is stylish and pretty. Beds were comfy. Close to stores and the silos. Wish we had more time to spend outside in the backyard but due to weather we couldn’t. Definitely made amazing memories and laughs in this house!

Group trip","There are not enough words to describe how amazing Jeff & Sarah were and how perfect this property was. Aside from the fantastic location, the attention to detail and all the little added extras made it that much better. They included things that we hadn’t even thought of. It made everything feel so homey. From the layout of the property to the amenities that were included. We were able to spend quality family time together under one roof. We had perfect weather to be able to utilize the patio to hang out and play games. We were amazed at the size of the yard and the kids had a blast running and playing in the yard with their cousins. The process for check in and check out was so simple and we had no trouble whatsoever! We would absolutely recommend this property to anyone and everyone we know."

Group trip","Beware the Shmear. We saw no less than 4 Cockroaches, so bring your bug catching net! Also you can’t go outside at night and use the backyard space because the neighbor’s dogs will bark incessantly. Only the downstairs was remodeled. The upstairs area of the house is old and there are pieces of the wood floor that aren’t flush or have holes, so watch out if you have kids and they are running around. Air conditioning isn’t accurate and we were freezing while the house was set to 73, but 74 produced a sauna. Overall not a pleasant experience, and when the cockroach issue was pointed out to the hosts, they interrogated me even after I provided VIDEO EVIDENCE. Needless to say, we won’t be back and you probably shouldn’t risk the stay."

Stayed with kids","Jeff & Sara's home is really exceptional. We booked an extended stay in Waco to be closer with family during the pandemic and provide our 1yr old daughter with a backyard to play. This beautiful home was a perfect choice for many reasons. It is stylish without being stuffy. The space functioned well as we cooked every meal, held work calls, entertained our daughter, and relaxed in the evenings. The full-size crib ensured that our daughter slept well and we enjoyed the thoughtful touches of luxury around the house. Having grown up in Waco, I knew exactly what neighborhoods would work for our needs but this particular street really impressed. There are large trees throughout the neighborhood ensuring shady walks and lots of beautiful homes. The neighbors are super sweet and we received lots of waves and ""howdy's"" on our evening strolls. Jeff & Sara were quick to respond when an overnight thunderstorm knocked out the wifi for a couple hours and we had no problems finding everything we needed during our stay. I can't say enough great things about this home and hosts. Highly recommended."

I was in Waco for work, so staying here checked all the boxes, and this biggest for me was the peacefulness. In some ways regretted not having wifii, but for work reasons only.

Stayed a few nights","We are here on April 21-23, 2023. We thought we were late for wild flowers season, but there are wildflowers right on the property and short driving distance. The flock of hens came to welcome us when we arrived. Check-in was at ease. plenty of space as shown in the pictures. This place fits best for 2 persons. The owner provides extra linen for my son to sleep on the comfy couch. Bed is super comfortable. There are kitchen, sink, coffee machine, refrigerator, microwave. So you could do some cooking here. Restroom is big and clean with cowboy decor. There are washer / dryer if you need to use it as well.
During our stay, we saw 2 cows, 2 horses, lots of hens, and a night clear sky. We enjoy stargazing at night.
There is a nice camper right on the property that belongs to the same owner if your family and friends need extra space. You could do the campfire too, but check with the owner first.
We got some fresh eggs and cook for breakfast along with some oatmeal too."

When we had a question about the heating, Heather responded immediately and gave us the information we needed to get it going. Even though there is no WiFi available, Heather provides Roku and a good selection of DVDs. There is a pond where guests can fish (fishing poles provided) and chickens who provide eggs."

The bed was so comfortable, there was a fan (which we appreciated cause we love the noise at night), and we were able to get a couple fresh eggs from the chickens the next morning. We spent a good amount of time on the porch watching the horses and enjoying the Texas sunset. The only thing I would mention is that there is a camper to the left side of the rental that is often rented out as well. We did not use the firepit but it is shared between the two rentals."

Stayed a few nights","To say Heather’s place is beautiful is an understatement. The whole experience was so surreal and extraordinary. The barndo is so cozy and peaceful. She’s fast to respond if you need anything and her and her husband are extremely friendly. The view is indescribable. This is the perfect getaway from your busy everyday life to sit back and enjoy all of the views and sounds of nature. The weather was on our side and we got to sit out and enjoy sunsets, sunrises, all of the stars and great wind. I will definitely be back again for another get away. Also love that it’s far enough but not too far from the city to do stuff during the day. Dr. Pepper museum was my favorite.
Thank you for the wonderful stay Heather!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Heather’s barndominium was a last minute decision and we couldn’t be happier with what we experienced. Heather was very quick to respond. Upon our arrival, she was so gracious to send her husband over and allow us to feed the cows since I’m an avid cow lover. We took advantage of having a fire our first evening in their fire pit and were able to star gaze some. The atmosphere was so serene and exactly what we needed amidst our busy lives. While the chickens didn’t produce any eggs on our short 2-night stay, we still enjoyed seeing and interacting with them. It’s not a far drive at all from Waco so it was nice spending our days in Waco and then being able to come back to a peaceful scene. We definitely recommend if you’re looking for a quiet and secluded get-away! You won’t be disappointed."

Do read the instructions on how to get here, apple maps has their mapping wrong and leads it to their neighbors. We got here with no problem though."

Make your reservations at the Magnolia Table weeks/months in advance because Waco is a tourist destination for many retirees like us.
We were fortunate to catch, on camera, the beautiful sunset from the porch.
We highly recommend Heather’s place if you plan to visit Waco!"

Heather has a wonderful place w all the amenities you need for a quick or longer stay. Microwave stove full size washer dryer and frig for your goodies. There is an outdoor grill and picnic tables so you can sit outside and enjoy the country air. And fresh eggs 🍳 for breakfast each morning. Super clean and nice and cool. Bring your hotspot if you want local channels. As there is no Wi-Fi. Enjoy!! We did and plan to visit again in the future.

We also very much appreciated the fully stocked cooking and coffee supplies in the kitchen. Cupboards full of great dish ware, utensils, and cooking/baking tools.

We had everything we needed in the kitchen to cook breakfast daily. Loved the air fryer, there was also a nice coffee bar with coffee creamers and sweeteners, by the dining table. Otherwise it was exactly as described.

The cottage had a modern farm house vibe, with thoughtful touches such as Keurig pods and creamers provided in the cute coffee bar. We stayed in December and the tree and holiday lights were such a nice touch.
Cory sent very clear instructions a few days prior to arrival. Entry was very simple with the keypad entry and also felt very safe and secure. The rental is a short 5-10 minutes drive to the Silos and several restaurants and boutiques in the area. We did extensive research and this rental was a great value. I highly recommend it and can't wait to stay here on our next overnight in Waco!"

The kitchen was well equipped. The coffee nook had sufficient amount and assortment of coffee supplies for the number of guests. We loved the special features in the bunk bedroom including the individual overhead light for each guest and an outlet for charging electronics. Cory was responsive when we had a question. We appreciate the quality of mattresses and linen. Will stay in this property when traveling to Waco in future.
Great value!!!"

You can tell the house was built in the 1920s and although it has been redone and is extremely stylish, you can feel the history and charm of the home. There is a coffee bar with flavored syrups inside the house if you don’t want to make the trek down the street. The house is also near Magnolia market. I would definitely recommend this house and would like to come back and visit sometime."

The beds were comfy, the house was spotless and felt very clean and safe. It’s exactly as pictured and we felt very comfortable.

Reservations and communications prior to the visit went smoothly and Cory answered questions promptly.

The cottage was sparkling clean and welcoming, tastefully decorated, and there are special touches for comfort throughout.
Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Our stay was fifteen days, so the fully equipped kitchen was a delight to work in.
Outdoor temperatures were extremely high during our entire visit, so the HVAC system worked overtime and performed perfectly.
We were fairly unfamiliar with Waco when we arrived and found the cottage to be well located and private. Parking is off road and convenient.
Cory and Callie have created a little bit of heaven for travelers. Thank you both for your attention to details."

The neighborhood was quiet and right around the corner from Harvest on 25th and one of our favorite bars, Sloanes. It's also walkable to Pinewood coffee, which is also a favorite of ours. The kitchen had everything you could think of including a blender and toaster oven! We hosted a lunch for the grandparents we had in town for the graduation and had everything we needed to prepare it. Cory is a very responsive host. I usually waited no more than a couple of minutes for a response. The beds were very comfortable...even the bunks. We've already booked two more stays at Uptown cottage for when we come to a few Baylor games next season."

Myself, my son and his friend stayed for one night during a visit to Baylor. There were so many great things- I’ll use bullets so I can fit then all in.
Positives:
-Immaculately clean
-tastefully decorated and uncluttered
-wonderful neighborhood, walkable, close to EVERYTHING
-off-street parking behind the home
-private
-thoughtful touches (snack basket, cold water)
-easy check in with coded keypad at front and back door
-responsive host, though we had zero issues
Negatives: Absolutely none
The home was so nice that two 14 year-old boys were impressed. That’s hard to do! None of us wanted to leave. The hosts did a wonderful job with the place; there are too many details to list. I loved that there was a first aid kit. We felt right at home. The icing on the cake was the bird’s nest above the front door camera which housed newborn baby birds. I love that the owner left the nest there for mama bird and her babies.
I will stay again when I return to Waco."

It smelled lovely as well. It was even better than the pictures. Rye and Dana had a wonderful photo book that told us about their history and explaining some of the unique and special pieces in the house along with suggestions for food, entertainment and shopping. Our main interest was the Magnolia Shops and Silos and they are all within walking distance of the house. The beds were comfy, we had everything we needed. The only thing that made us sad was that we were only staying one night. We will definitely stay with Dana and Rye in the future!"

They go above and beyond anything you’d expect of an Airbnb. We kept being delightfully surprised at all the thoughtful details. Apple chargers at every bedside, snacks and wine upon arrival, and cozy ambiance with the fire going and candles lit. If you think you forgot something, think again. Dana probably has it available for you. The beds were extremely comfortable. The outdoor space is very cute. We walked everywhere! Dr. Pepper museum and the silos are both within 10 minutes. But honestly, we had such a lovely time just hanging out at the cottage! Dana’s also made some wonderful suggestions for restaurants and shopping. We took her up on a lot of her suggestions and were not disappointed. The 1905 latte from Magnolia Press was fantastic. 10/10 recommend staying here!!!"

I arrived to find the cottage warm on a cool night, fire on, and candles burning in every room. It smelled delicious and made me feel at home immediately!
As I explored my home for the weekend, I was impressed by the incredible eye for detail; nothing was left wanting.
While it was just me for this stay and it makes for the perfect retreat, I would most certainly want to share this experience with someone when visiting again. A romantic weekend, sisters getaway, mom and son trip, this cottage is the perfect landing spot.
A few of my favorite details:
- the design OMG! Beautiful!
- white linens
- cloud of a bed
- Itty bitty extra bathroom
- photo wall
- wine, Dr. Pepper & peanuts
- drawer of things you forgot to pack
- backyard fire
- fireworks from hammock
- easy parking
- everything is walkable
- Poppy's poetry
- the creativity here
- the amazing hosts ❤️

The master bedroom bed was amazing. I slept sooo good and I often struggle sleeping on beds other than my own. Overall, I’m planning to book again next year for an anniversary trip 🥰"

Dana & Rye literally have thought of everything. They are so intentional with the decoration and accommodations, the sentimental qualities in their cottage, and the ease of having chargers, items you might have forgotten, utilizing every inch of space so well, etc… was all so impressive. Everywhere we looked there was another fabulous item or decor that was just stunning. You can tell they love life and have created a space for others to truly enjoy and create beautiful memories. They prepared us so well for our trip and we did many things on their list of recommendations! The best girls weekend ever! Thank you for your incredible hospitality. We’ve already told others about your place and can’t wait to come back!"

The backyard is the perfect hangout spot and feels very private. It appeared that the building across the road is under construction. Once that is finished the surroundings will look much nicer! You do not even notice it once you are inside though. We would definitely recommend this home, and the hosts, if you are looking to visit Magnolia!"

Stayed a few nights","The attention to detail here was incredible, and there were instructions for everything. Each light switch was labeled, which I thought was a nice touch. The tp was rough, but I loved the nice linens and non-toxic handsoap. Everything we could have possibly needed was there, including some fabulous wines. I really appreciated the tastefully scented candles that were going upon our arrival and let out a literal breath of relief to discover there weren't any gross chemical smells like glade plug ins or harsh cleaners in the house.
The space was beautiful, clean, cozy, and inviting both inside and out. My only possible critique is that the lack of curtains in the secondary bedroom makes it impossible to sleep late because the room gets flooded with early morning sunlight.
check in and check out was so easy, and it's always nice when hosts don't ask you to do 20 things before check out. If I'm ever back in waco, I'll definitely book with these fantastic hosts again."

On top of the wonderful space itself, our hosts were the best. They were totally responsive and even dropped off extra goodies and supplies mid-week because we stayed there for a full seven days.

As soon as you walk in you will have a WOW feeling and definitely feel the care of all the intentionality and hospitality. When you walk in there is a desk with all the info you need for your stay, and all the recommendations for every question you could think of as well as the questions you didn’t think of. This really impacted our trip. Lots of comfy throws, great beds, excellent kitchen, great showers, and comfy living room. ( suggestion) If you are into watching movies at night sign up with prime before you go and bring your log in info. Over all- 5 stars! We left fans of the place! :) As Mary Poppins says, It was “practically perfect in every way.”"

All the extra amenities - bathroom supplies, snacks, umbrellas, coffee - were an unexpected bonus! The guest map, guest book, and selfie wall were a fun touch also. We were the only pins from Nebraska on the map! Will definitely want to stay again and have recommended the house to several friends."

I was glad I remembered to bring my ear plugs as the house is on a moderately busy road and also has a train track 2-3 blocks away. We loved the personal touch that’s been added and Rye and Dana have seriously thought of everything. We enjoyed reading the family story and shared poems on the walls.

Stayed one night","My husband and I planned a short weekend trip to Waco to visit all things Magnolia and absolutely loved Riley and Dana’s home!
First off, the design and look of the place was SO cute. For a “tiny home” it felt so spacious - literally there was not a single inch in that place that didn’t serve a very functional purpose that made it feel like a large two-bedroom home! They also made sure that we had plenty (and I mean PLENTY) of amenities! There was a complimentary bottle of wine, snacks, plenty of toiletries, even a cute little dish of scones for us! They really went all out to make sure their guests felt comfortable and truly at home. Finally, the location of the place is perfect if you are planning a weekend to visit the Magnolia Silos - just a few minutes walking distance down the street. There is also parking on-site which was a big plus as Magnolia parking is a total zoo.
Overall, we absolutely loved our stay in Riley an Dana’s perfectly appointed home. We can’t wait to return!"

Stayed one night","Wow. We literally were blown away with the personalization and care Dana and Rye put into this home. Over the years we have stayed in over 50 airbnb's and this is probably in the top 1 or 2. We cannot describe how comfortable we felt in this home. It's a small cottage, but you don't feel that when you are inside or on the property. When we arrived there was music playing, the TV was on with peaceful images, a couple of candles were safely lit in containers. There were personalized, informative instructions. There was a sign welcoming us with my wife's name on it. The beds were terrific, bathrooms pristine. They have done an amazing job converting the property into modern-traveler standards. We enjoyed ping-pong on a custom table, the firepit, and a bottle of wine called ""Poppy"". Very close to silos - 5 min walk. We both felt that a piece of Dana and Rye are truly in this home and their message and story they shared made us feel welcomed! I'm running out of room - but could go on!"

We commented on how we didn’t feel like we had to adapt; it was so easy to step in, put our things down, and relax. We loved the space, the place, and the conveniences to Magnolia.

It's one of those places you can truly feel home away from home, and leave rejuvenated and inspired. Each room was well appointed, functional, extremely comfortable and it's own sensory experience, not to mention the ping pong, propane fireplace, and dreamy hammock space in the backyard. We were so pleased with the walkability of the neighborhood and ended up having quite a foodie experience just at the nearby restaurants. Waco is a fun place to explore and Poppy and Rye cottage was the ideal homebase, providing many suggestions for our 5-day vacation. We couldn't have asked for more kind and responsive hosts.

Stayed with kids",We could not have asked for a better experience for our first trip to Waco. Perfect details all over this cottage from the treats to the outdoor space! My 15 year old was in heaven with ping pong! We felt so welcomed - like they set the space up just for us! This is the kind of air bnb that keeps people coming back time and time again. Thank you so much Poppy & Rye for a truly special experience for my family!

From the moment you pull into the driveway and open the front door you’re met with so much charm, love, and hospitality. There is no question that Rye & Dana deeply care and take such pride in their cottage! It is a smaller place but so functional. Our group had 2 adults and a toddler and felt we had plenty of space with more than enough amenities for anything we needed! The design is gorgeous and so fun to explore. Location was perfect for walking over to Magnolia and different restaurants/shops of Waco! Staying here was one of the best decisions we made for our trip and can’t wait to go back!"

It is located within walking distance of Magnolia Silos and other downtown shopping, entertainment, restaurants, coffee houses, breweries etc.
The kitchen is well equipped, the bathrooms are beautiful, and the beds are comfortable.
There are many personal touches left for you by the homeowner: chocolates by the bedside, snacks in the kitchen, a good selection of wines in the wine cooler, scones under glass; and let’s not forget Poppy’s poetry on the walls – truly inspirational.
We enjoyed our stay here immensely. We are already planning our next visit."

From the moment we walked in the door, there were candles burning, snacks on the counter, background music playing, and a welcome note telling us to enjoy the bottle of wine they left us. They even sent a message letting us know they had chilled a bottle of sparkling grape juice for our daughter's 13th Birthday in case we wanted to raise a toast to her. The house was spotless, and was even better than the pictures(which were beautiful)! The beds were super comfortable, the bathrooms were perfect, and the backyard was just as wonderful as the house. We had a fantastic time playing ping pong and sitting in the hammock. The location was ideal because we could walk to almost everything. The owners were prompt in reaching out to us letting us know how excited they were about our upcoming trip, and also to send all the details about the property. The house was so personalized, that I felt like I was welcomed as family and at home. It couldn't have been any better!"
