Stayed with a pet","This house is large, extremely clean, and very well furnished. There is an enclosed patio that worked perfect for an office. The back yard is huge and completely surrounded by woods. One evening we had 8 deer go across the back yard. Hopefully I can figure out a way to post pictures. If you need a large, affordable, very nice, comfortable house, I would highly recommend this one."

Stayed one night","Hope made us wait 1.5 hours after our 4:00 check-in. I had to contact Airbnb support to get entry into the home.
She apologized, but it’s still a crappy situation when you’re 4 hours away from home.
Washer and dryer that are listed as usable are actually in a blocked off area."

Check in was easy and expections were clearly communicated. Great, quiet location with easy access to stores and commute to Michigan International Speedway. Easy access to freeway. Fully stocked kitchen and cute coffee bar. Spacious, updated, and comfy with plenty of towels, linens, and extras. Great selection of TV channels. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

Stayed a few nights","very nice stay. quiet neighborhood, shopping and food is walking distance (target right across the street, house was clean, had games to play, host even put a TV in my room to help me sleep. 🥰
we did have to buy our own toilet paper, paper towels, soap, etc. for a one weekend stay. Only one toilet paper and a few paper towel sheets provided at first. When they said the basics, I didn't realize it was going to be that low on stock. Oh, and bring your own sugar/cream. They provide a few K cups, but no sugar or cream. Also, keep in mind that there is no outside seating, as you are very close to the neighbors, so no room to sit. (but that didn't bother us)
Overall, great stay, great location, and nice home. I would stay here again when back in Michigan."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great a new find! Beautiful and spacious space with everything you need to relax and enjoy your trip. Peggy is great at communicating and being available should you need anything (which you won’t). The house was extremely clean, recently renovated and pleasantly decorated. Plenty of shopping, restaurants and things to do within walking distance. We cooked all our meals during our stay and the kitchen had everything we needed. Beds were comfortable, showers hot and furniture comfortable for relaxing. Neighbors are close but didn’t hear a thing. We kept our granddaughter for the day and I had zero reservations about her crawling around and touching things. Squeaky clean! The price is excellent for the space, service was 5 stars and all the creature comforts of home. Don’t skip this one. Totally worth it!"

Stayed with kids","The apartment worked well for us: good location, very well equipped kitchen, and surprisingly quiet given the age of the building and number of units. Steve and Betty were accommodating and gave us an early check-in.
Overall, it was a good place to stay for the week while we did some work on our house nearby. However, there was some chipping lead paint which is not great for children; the sheets on one of the bed were tattered and had big holes; some of the storms are not up and so the space between the windows (which are filled with debris and some insects) are open to the living space; and last, there's a bench with some outdoor cushions that was not comfortable to sit on. If not for these few items, it would be a perfect place to stay."

I will definitely be staying here if I ever return to the area."

Stayed a few nights","Nice owner; great communication. Lots of character in this tiny little apartment! Price was right and location was good for the purpose of our visit. Muffins in the freezer, stocked coffee drawer and Keurig a welcome touch. That said, likely would not rebook. Simply too noisy for us between the pounding footsteps above to the traffic outside on the 2 main roads. The beds were quite comfortable but the constant stop and go at the traffic light directly on the corner made a good night’s sleep difficult during our 3 day visit."

Stayed a few nights","The building is super cute, and the place was clean. My only complaints are that the parking spaces were really small and I scratched my rental car backing out of it. To be fair, the host did warn me about the small spaces, but still. When I arrived, I noticed a tray of ear plugs on the counter and the next night, when the neighbors were throwing a loud party, I realized why. Neither of these things were the host’s fault, and they did their best to mitigate it, but those two things definitely detracted from the overall experience"

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is a bit small but definitely beautiful. We have stayed with Steve and Betty a few times and they next fail to impress. Jackson is a great little town with a lot of nightlife and local bars. We absolutely recommend Roxy’s Cafe for breakfast and Grand River Brewery for lunch and dinner. Steve and Betty have always had snacks and coffee at the ready. The apartment does sit off a busy intersection so it is sometimes noisy, but they do have earplugs available if needed. Parking is limited but you do have a covered space with the rental. We will absolutely stay with them next time we are in town."

We were able to prepare meals in the kitchen, enjoyed the Kurig coffee, and the air conditioning allowed us to rest comfortably. The only drawback was that the parking stall was a bit tight and with construction on the road out front, it was a little tricky to find on the first night, but once we knew where we were to park, it was good. Thanks for having us! We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",The place was really clean. It is close to a Walmart and most of the restaurants. The apartment is really old and was extremely cold in the apartment. They did have a heater but it takes a learning curve to use it. Not very helpful if you fear of something breaking. The beds are not very large meaning a couple will have a time with the uncomfortable mattress. The other bed was a little better but in a closet. Also the water was lukewarm at best for a shower.

Stayed with kids","Great location! Right by Walmart and Westwood Mall.
Very clean! And great amenities! Also, the available food was really convenient! They had a Keurig, tea, hot chocolate, breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and popcorn available, as well as actually having more than just salt and pepper for spices. They had ear plugs if you aren't used to cars driving by, little space heaters, a good supply of bathroom items.
It is a very cute place, and Steve and Betty are doing a great job.
Parking was fine in my midsize pick-up. I recommend backing into the space.
The shower/water takes a while to heat up, but this, as well as working the old radiators, is clearly explained in their instructions.
I will probably stay here again next time I'm visiting! Loved it!"

The apartment was clean and had the old style radiators for heat (which was great, but a small learning curve). Beds are a bit hard for my liking but my partner loved them. Bath towels are top notch however, the bath water took a very long time to heat up and stayed mild in temperature. Kitchen was small and perfect for quick stay. Road noise was very obvious, but they have ear plugs for nighttime if you can sleep with them in. Pictures do not do this place justice, it is beautiful with warm energy. They have minimalism on point and I would stay again!"

Stayed over a week","one bedroom apartment in a 100 year-old building. The best part of this experience were the hosts who proactively checked in on me throughout my stay, which I had never experienced anywhere else and is deeply appreciated. Their amenities such as big fluffy towels and comfortable bedding made the place more home than the average Airbnb. It is located along a busy intersection. Getting a pair of soft ear plugs is a must if you want good quality sleep at night. The biggest challenge was the heating system that is old style central not thermostat control. There were extended periods of time without heat despite me having turned on the heaters to max. I understand this is a historical building, but I also lived in 100+ years old buildings back East and never had to shiver in bed with indoor temperatures in the 50s and low 60s. On a positive note, it gave me new-found appreciation for modern technology and central heat/cooling when I finally returned home. In the end, the hosts are so nice and communicative that were what made this stay memorable."

Betty was so accommodating with our crazy schedule. She even helped a cousin book another unit. We had a loss in the family and she was super flexible and made sure we all had a place to stay. We can’t say enough good things about her. The unit was hot but once we figured out the fans it was good:) the location is loud mainly during the day on the street but it didn’t bother me and I’m a total light sleeper. The unit was adorable and clean. Nice linens and towels. Only suggestion would be to redo the bathroom shower. The snacks provided were much appreciated. We tend to be a tad more high maintenance than most people and we will def look forward to many more stays with Betty and her Airbnbs. She was wonderful and the space was just what we needed this time around. Many thanks."

The only things I’d give potential visitors a heads up on is that the main bed is pretty firm and the windows are razor thin - ear plugs were provided but without the air conditioner on next to the bed - you’ll probably be able to hear all the Michigan Ave traffic even late at night. The parking space is also super tight, but not much you can do there. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend this place to anyone visiting Jackson!"

All amenities were great and as described. Yes the busy main road is noisy, but our 3yo slept soundly in the front room with no complaints.
We felt the apartment was great value, and we found the location excellent - not least of all because it was a very short walk to both Cold Stone and The Parlour!"

Wish it was as easy access as last year, like on the first floor location we got from Steve and Beatty last year, but totally doable. Parking was AWESOME for our full size van !!! Getting hot water in the Bathroom sink was hard, and the drain in the kitchen was slow, but everything else was great !!! We did not report this until we left, so they had no knowledge, or a chance, to fix this."

The bed we slept in was comfortable and the shower was hot. After being on the road, we enjoyed having our own kitchen to prepare healthy meals. The location was perfect for us. The neighborhood was very walkable with sidewalks and pretty trees/flowers/houses to see. A shopping center (Westwood Mall) with a Wal-Mart was also within walking distance. The building is old and as such it is possible to hear noise from the apartment above the flat. My partner is a very light sleeper so he noticed some noise."

Stayed with kids","We stayed in Jackson for two nights to attend an awards ceremony. it's a decent location close to downtown Jackson. Steve and Betty were so responsive and let us check in early. The apartment was cozy enough for two nights and they provided some complimentary breakfast items which was nice. The only thing to be aware of is that you can hear EVERYTHING the people in the apartment above are doing. it sounds like they have kids because there's pretty much constant running, vacuuming, moving things around, just regular living. it was manageable for a short stay but I could see how it could drive someone crazy after awhile. other than that, it's a good spot and the beds are super comfy."

I think a little more decor might make it feel more cozy. But all the necessities were provided, plus some complementary snacks and coffee. The walls are thin and the floors creaky. My neighbors were not making excessive noise, but you can hear any footstep, and you can hear voices even at a normal conversation sound level. I am a heavy sleeper so it was no problem for me, but it might be for some. Overall, a great stay that met all my needs. Thank you, Steve and Betty!"

Group trip","Steve and Betty’s place was very spacious. Comfortable beds. As like other reviews the upstairs neighbors were noisy but from what we heard, it was just during daytime hours and seemed like just little kids running around up there. We slept great both nights we were there tho. There wasn’t any noise at night. When we first drove in, there were grocery carts by the garbage full of what looked liked homeless gear and lots of graffiti around the area so we were a little skeptical at first but all in all it’s a very nice place for the price. It was cozy and comfortable and we enjoyed our stay."

If they would have stated that the lodging would have a very strong fruity fragrance, I would not have made the reservation.
I understand advertising the property in the best light, but these are things a proprietor should be honest about.
Also, noise from the occupants of the floor above included vacuuming, and children's voices, loud thumps and bumps - during the hour (9:45-10:45) that we tried to sleep. Then we got up and left.
I am sorry, but I will not trust this superhost again."

As this cut into the purpose of my stay, My time there was not ideal. However, as hosts, Steve and Betty did everything within their power and in an extremely timely fashion to help ease the situation. They made the situation alright for me! I am not upset and was very content with my treatment by Steve and Betty. Had things gone exactly as planned, and if there was no work being done, I am positive my stay would have been perfect! My lower score is not because of the hosts, but rather it is because of the situation. The apartment itself and the service provided was wonderful."

Stayed a few nights","The place was extremely clean and very spacious. If you have children or more than two adults it’s a great place to stay for the money. The only downside is there are people up above that you do hear walking around and it was unseasonably warm in this area, so it was warm in the apartment. There were fans provided which was great. Steve and Betty were very very responsive as I checked in very late on my first night, They were accommodating and very easy to work with."

Stayed a few nights","Overall great stay!
My only complaint is that the upstairs neighbor was very noisy late into the night moving furniture or something... totally not something Steve or Betty could control at the time but, maybe a friendly reminder to the upstairs tenants of quiet hours wouldn't hurt.
The place is exactly as described, super comfortable, and even the king-sized bed is very comfortable. The towels and linens were all so plush. We loved having the coffee, breakfast muffins, breakfast sandwiches, popcorn, and other well-thought-of things stocked in the kitchen. The only thing we wished was there that wasn't was bottled water.
Thank you so much Steve and Betty for a wonderful stay! I'll definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights",My stay was fine. The first floor apartment in an older building was fine for me to stay at while working in the area. The older carpet covered the creaky floors which I would assume was the same for the apartment above as I could hear people walking around. I did not require the earplugs that were left in each of the bedrooms. The place was clean bright with the exception of the front room where the knight is. Only 1 wall light fixture worked there. The couch and chair in the TV room we're comfortable. The shower had plenty of hot water with good pressure. The parking spot was a little hard to find for the first time in the dark. The kitchen had basics and nothing more. I would stay there again if working in the area.

(I thought that was a wide sidewalk!) The breakfast items and coffee were a great way to start my day, and my son and I enjoyed playing cards at the table in the front room. (We brought our own games, but there were some nice options if we hadn't.) Lovely thick towels in the bathroom, too, and thoughtful to have spare toiletries, too.
Convenient to Jackson as well as interstates. There was some noise from the city streets as noted in the listing -- but that was not a surprise. We enjoyed RJ's Metropolitan nearby, but I wish I'd saved room for one of their crazzzzy milkshakes."

The neighborhood is quiet but it is right near a busy street so there is traffic noise during the day. In warm weather when the window air conditioners are running you don't hear it. It's within easy walking distance of downtown with lots of restaurants and shops.
The little side parking lot has a concrete driveway so it's easy to miss if you arrive after dark. Kudos to the hosts for the detailed directions and instructions. They were also lightning fast to respond to messages.
Definitely would stay here again if I'm back in town, thanks Steve & Betty!"

We didn’t have a need for communicating with the host leading up to or during our stay, so their welcome message and information ahead of time was perfect and all we needed! It’s nothing too fancy and gets the job done for a quick overnight stay on a budget like we were looking for.. They had coffee for you and extra supplies in case you forgot something. Plenty of space- I didn’t realize how large it would be until we got there. There is a Smokey smell to the place and I wish I would have seen the air filter machine before the morning we were leaving- we would have used it! Thanks, Steve & Betty!"

The neighborhood seemed OK, but we did have one instance of loud pedestrians causing an early morning rucous near the building on our day of departure. The beds were comfortable and towels plush. The owners provided breakfast snacks and coffee. The apartment was drafty because of cold air coming in through window air conditioning units. The owners were easy to work with and apparently own other units in the Jackson area which we would not hesitate to book on a future visit."

Group trip","Nice roomy place that took us back to our college days -- reminded us a lot of the off-campus housing we used to live in (urban setting, older building, etc.). Our family was able to comfortably spread out in this space. The set up that you can't see in the pictures was a little strange -- you enter in the dining room (seats 6 comfortably), move into the living room (Disney Plus subscription was a plus for our son! Games in the closet as well), then walk down the long hallway, passing two bedrooms to the back of the place where the bathroom, and finally the kitchen are located. The kitchen has two additional chairs and a small table. We used the chairs in the dining room, and walked our food down the hallway and through the living room to eat in the dining room. As a family, we tend to eat in, and the kitchen had a few gaps which we were able to creatively fill (lack of sufficient pots and pans). Otherwise it was fully stocked with a Keurig and an assortment of coffees and teas as well as some breakfast items in the cupboard and the freezer. Overall, we had a comfortable stay (the air conditioning was a plus on a VERY hot weekend, and found the hosts to be very helpful with tips along the way."

Stayed one night","Being my first Airbnb I really didn’t know what to expect. A last second snafu in my plans forced me to look for a place and same day. I’m REALLY happy I found this one!
The directions, communication and description from the host were spot on and perfect. I was easily able to find this gem and get unloaded quickly.
The pictures didn’t really do it justice and it was much better when I got inside! You can tell they keep this place up and care for their travelers - even the snacks, breakfast sandwiches and Keurig with Tim Horton’s just shows that!
The neighborhood was super quiet and didn’t hear a peep from any neighbors. The beds were definitely comfy and the air conditioning units kept it cool the whole I was there.
Only problem is - I wish I would’ve invited a friend or two or enjoy this home away from home on our way to Dowagiac! Haha thanks again and I loved it!"

It’s the kind of place where you feel safe leaving the windows open to enjoy some fresh air. The surroundings are beautiful and very peaceful. As a host, Stacey was very responsive and professional - she treated me like family, instead of like a renter. Stacey is honest and follows through on her word. Everything about the house and her stewardship is far above average. My experience was an 11/10 and I would stay at Stacey’s home again."

Love the mudroom and foyer for drop off of shoes, jackets and handbags as we also don’t wear shoes inside the house!
We had some last minute preparations to finish up for the wedding so the meeting room was perfect for that.
Jessica was so accommodating and came over to lend us a play pen and baby gate. Thank you so much!"

When we booked we had no idea about the conference table and the arcade machines and those were a huge surprise in a good way- it made it much easier for us to divide into different groups and do our own thing, and there was plenty of space to be alone when needed.

We brought baby gates for the stairs… but didn’t really use them cuz the kids used the “playroom”, living room, bedroom & outside for entertainment. We used one of the bedrooms right off the kitchen as a playroom!! The open kitchen/dining that opened into the living room was exactly what we needed. It was like one big open space so we could all be together. We were able to cook an amazing Thanksgiving dinner in the large kitchen while the kids played outside! The backyard is huge and fenced in. We sipped coffee on the side patio! We enjoyed the master bedroom w/ a relaxing jet tub!! We were blessed to watch the deer that walked by the front window!!! We will definitely be staying here again!!"

Stayed a few nights","Thank you Aaron. Our stay was simple, and the stay here was just right. Clean and well appointed. The only downside was the heat, it was a bit warm and the only way to cool it off was to open a window, which worked out just fine. The pull out was super comfortable as was the bed. It was close to our daughter’s home and made it easy to see the grandkids! Thank you for the opportunity to stay here. We would love to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my stay- it was quiet and I felt it was a safe location. Motion activated light in the driveway was great…
It’s an upstairs apartment but didn’t hear any noise from downstairs. I am tech savvy so I was able to figure out the app for opening the door. There was a window open when I came in but realized that was for temp control as it stayed quite warm with the heat running continually. The bed was comfortable and the only thing I couldn’t find for amenity listed was a hairdryer. I was able to cook meals with ease as there are basic supplies.
Thank you I enjoyed my time in Jackson."

Stayed over a week","Aaron was so communicative and willing to help! We had a problem with our TV while we were there, and he went above and beyond and replaced the whole thing! The couch is amazing and works great as a second bed especially with the foam topper he had. The space had all of the essentials. The kitchen was so nice to have, but it was very light on equipment, so if you’re planning on cooking a lot, you will need to purchase some additional things as we did. But the area was beautiful, wonderful to walk around and see the Fall leaves. And the off street parking was so nice to have! Overall this is a really nice space and perfect for two people."

Stayed about a week","I stayed here for a week in January while I was looking for a place to live. The location was perfect for getting to know the town as well as an extremely smooth and painless check in through the host. Perfect situation for me and glad I chose this spot.
They also had a few other properties in their pocket that were relayed to me to see if they would fit my criteria. All of them hit everything except the longevity of my stay (months), so unfortunately we were unable to make something happen. But the fact that they tried so hard and were willing to make things work possibly is need enough for me to stay here or at any of their other proterties again if need be.
Great place even greater host."

The space has complete privacy from the main house (it's an apartment above the home) and is a nice halfway point between Lansing and Ann Arbor. If you're planning on doing both, why not stop in between so you're in striking distance from both?
Had snacks for us (thank you!) in the fridge, things in the kitchen if wanting to cook, tea and coffee there as well. Great touch."

The overhead (fan) light didn't work in the larger bedroom, & there was only one bedside lamp, so we were unable to read in bed. Also, cute furniture, but only one end table to set a coffee cup on. The bathroom sink drains extremely slowly. Just some improvements to make the apartment more comfortable for future guests. The white noise machine was a great help for sleeping."

Stayed one night","Overall this place was very nice. There is only one very tight parking space and there was a group of 4 of us and we all had our own vehicles as it was a girls trip. So that was an issue but one we solved pretty quickly with some planning and moving things around. I think the leaves by the entrance need to be cleaned up and the entryway swept. Every time we came in and out we tracked all kinds of stuff in with us. But it wasn’t too big an issue because we just kept sweeping the floor. Because of the steam boiler systems used to heat the unit, it got very hot very quickly. We were able to open the windows and use the in unit AC to cool the space down. I do wish that there was maybe an extra set of linens for the beds in the unit but it wasn’t too big an issue. The Kitchen and bathroom are gorgeous and I can tell a lot of love went into decorating the space. All in all a good stay! If you’re looking for a nice little place to spend a few days this is a great option!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5"

We also found 2 insects in the living room and one tiny spider in the bathroom, I guess it’s because the building is a little bit old.

Love the extras provided, muffins, popcorn, hot chocolate, disposable coffee cups with lids, etc.
They were very responsive to any message we had. There was a mishap on the first night, but they were quick to fix the problem and we didn’t have any issues after.
I’m not sure where the reviews about the noise come from, but we didn’t find it to be super distracting. There were a few loud cars that drove by, but all in all, it was not terrible.

The only thing that was less than perfect was the parking and we were told in advance which was helpful. Really not a deal breaker unless you are in a very large vehicle. Location was a bit busy but we knew that and it wasn't a problem for us. When we visit Jackson again we hope this rental is available.

Stayed one night","Steve and Betty’s place was a great space for a stop over. Well decorated and nice welcoming touches (some snacks, coffee, toothbrush in case you forget to pack one). Overall it was a great stay. My only issue was coming in late, with no front light or house lights on, which is not the best feeling for a woman traveling alone. The doors had the automatic lock from the outside but no extra lock on the inside so anyone who might have the code could come in. A simple latch lock would help make it feel much more secure."

Stayed one night","We stayed for one night. The apartment was quite comfortable, and it had everything we needed. It was close to Walmart which is convenient. The beds where comfortable. The whole building is heated with radiating heat and only one full size spare blanket for 2 bedrooms and I could have used another blanket in the smaller room as I was cold. It was right on a bit of a noisy intersection but during the night it was quiet and ear plugs were supplied. The designated parking under carport would not have fitted 2 SUV’s next to each other, glad I had a Camry, tight squeeze. Overall nice place to stay. Bedrooms were nice and dark for sleeping."

They were very thoughtful and provided snacks, earplugs and toiletries if we needed them. The price was a steal! Parking was tight, but worked. We will 100% stay again if we return to the area."

Stayed with kids","Great Place! In a beautiful historic building. Very clean place and everything looks new and recently remodeled. They were so sweet and left coffee and breakfast things for us to have. Their communication was top notch.
I only have 2 complaints out of the whole stay and 1 is not their fault in the slightest but I feel it should be said so others would know. You can not control the heater at all. The first night we were there I could not sleep because it was so hot. Probably close to 85°F if I were to guess. I had to open a window so I could get airflow. They do have a portable air conditioner in there and the next day I cut it all the way down to 64 just to get the place down to 76°F.
The second thing is that the mattresses were hard. Might just be a preference thing. But I like my mattress to be a little more on the softer side.
Besides those 2 things, the place is amazing. Convenient location. Literally minutes from a Walmart. So much to do in Jackson. Love the antique vibe."

I was a tad put off by the ""emergency exit"" in the bedroom, as it isn't shown in pictures or noted in the description- it wouldn't have been a deal breaker and didn't effect the stay- just for future guests, be aware that one of the bedrooms has an outside accessible door in it, which deadbolts from the inside."

There were a few minor things in the bathroom that have to be tended to, but based on the host’s quick responses and attentiveness, I have absolutely no doubt that they will be taken care of by the time their next guests arrive. The apartment is by a busy intersection, so it does get noisy at times. The hosts provide ear plugs and a white noise machine, so it’s not too bad. Overall, we had a great stay and we would definitely book again should life take us back to Jackson."

My only less than 5 star rating was honestly just for the location being so close to the street as a basement apartment but let me also say that they have thought of everything to help mitigate that issue. They provide you with ear plugs AND a fabulous sound machine. I slept like a baby!
See you soon Steve and Betty!

Stayed a few nights","Very hot apartment even in chilly weather.
I failed to notice the reviews for the heat issues, or would have second guessed booking.
There was nothing wrong with the accommodations, except the temperature.
The building has central boiler heat system and can’t be controlled in this apartment. I noticed an AC unit when we came in but didn’t think about it until I noticed how warm it was even with it running.
It was unbearably hot- the ac unit couldn’t keep up and the fans just circulated warm air which made for a sleep deprived night.
if you like the warmth, it’s a super cute place and I think they are trying to work on a solution.
This would have been a 5 star review based solely on the fact that they are very responsive hosts and accommodated a request before we arrived and were very willing to try to work with us to resolve the issues."

Its location is convenient with stores and food options close by. Our favorite is the Grand River Brewery which is just a few minutes away in the downtown area . We always look forward to our stop in Jackson!"

If this was a different location it would have been ten stars. They are amazing hosts.
The ground floor windows were a bit overwhelming for this single mom."

There was an issue during check-in (my error - I couldn’t find the correct door) but the instructions they sent made more sense after I figured it out *and* they were quick to respond to my question to help me figure it out. Their place is so clean and cute! It had everything we needed to prepare dinner and we enjoyed a cozy night in. Great location close to downtown and included our own parking space. We’d really love to stay here next time we visit Jackson if they welcome us back!

There was no thermostat and heat radiated from the pipes in the ceiling. We sincerely had to sleep with windows open in 15 degree weather because the apartment was so warm. Great hosts, great communication."

Stayed with kids","This is the third property of Steve & Betty's I've stayed at, and all have been great stays! I loved the modern look of the space. One thing to note is that this unit is heated by radiant heat from a steam boiler, so you can't do much to control the temp. I noticed that as the temp dropped outside, the apt got a lot warmer, as I assume the steam boiler worked harder to heat the apt building. So if you're someone that gets hot easily, staying here in the colder months may be uncomfortable for you. Other than that, the apt was awesome and I look forward to more stays with them. Great locations, great value, and great service from hosts!"

Group trip","This house is just what we needed for our group. We were looking for a centrally located spot in Michigan for friends from across the Midwest to meet for a long weekend. The house and amenities were great. We loved taking the kayaks around the island channel. It is a great retreat and wide life (swans, deer, and sandhill cranes) all greeted us at some point during our stay. There was ample room to play yard games that we brought (kan jam, corn hole and spikeball) between the garage and house. More than enough parking for the 6 cars that we brought. The rooms were comfortable and as listed. I would recommend this home to anyone."

If you have a large vehicle it can be challenging, and there is no room for a second vehicle if a spouse drove separately etc. Otherwise it was a great stay"

- easy access to apartment, no key needed
- ac in the bedroom cooled the whole apartment and wasn't loud
- extra toiletries under the bathroom sink (deodorant for men and women, tooth brushes, toothpaste, etc)
- provided snacks (muffins, popcorn and oatmeal) and drinks (coffee and tea pods, tea bags and hot cocoa)
cons:
- mattress in bedroom was hard and not comfortable
- wifi was not reliable, kept disconnecting when inside but was slightly better when outside the building
recommendations:
- throw blanket/s for the couch
- cotton balls/rounds and qtips for bathroom
overall this was a good Airbnb, was across the street from Walmart and a mall which was useful, exactly as described and met our expectations, I would choose another Airbnb from them again :)"

The place was perfect for us. The bed was comfy, coffee service was great with a Keurig and plenty of pods, and the TV worked easily . We could not get Netflix to work for some reason, but Hulu and Tubi were both available so all good, along with network tv.
The day after the storm was good and we made dinner reservations at Veritas in the very cute downtown area, only a drive of just over a mile, easily walkable in the summer. It was a fantastic restaurant, steak and seafood, full bar, live music while we were there. Lots of other cute looking places down there too.
We would love to come back when there is no blizzard!"

Cons- was a cracked window, difficulty closing/locking windows, difficulty locking front door with keyless lock pad, no exhaust fan in bathroom for ventilation, no way of controlling the heat in the apartment because the pipes on the ceiling are very hot and the AC unit in the bedroom can not cool the entire unit, there were many bugs we saw but nothing too alarming.
Guests should also be aware that this is an older apartment building with the unit being downstairs after walking in the entrance and you need to go down a hallway. Bed was not very comfortable and it creeks loudly at every movement. I would recommend brining own pillows."

We brought extra blankets and she provided plenty as well. Overall, Halley’s place was clean and comfy and if in the area again, we will be back!

We truly wish we’d had more time to spend and explore the area and trails but we were in town briefly for a family birthday. Super clean. Only reason I didn’t rate it 5 stars was that the heating created an inconsistent temp in the bedroom (got hot after it was on a bit, then would get quite chilly before kicking back on) and the bed was quite firm. If you like a firm bed then this may be for you but we are both side sleepers so it led to a bit of soreness and discomfort for us."

Stayed one night",Hailey is so awesome. Her place is so cute. The bungalow had everything in it. We walked to the winery which was .5 miles away. Beautiful walk. We will definitely stay here again if we’re in this direction

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful get-away bungalow - so peaceful and quiet. Seeing the owner's horses in their pastures every day, exploring the walking trails, checking out all the veggies growing in the raised bed gardens, and watching for wild turkeys and sandhill cranes flying overhead or in the nearby fields was most enjoyable. Mustn't forget to mention trying the mulberries. Bed was comfortable and the unit met all of our needs during our stay. Halley was a great host - very generous with her time and very accommodating."

Stayed a few nights",This bungalow is a wonderful property. It is as stated: 1 bedroom apartment with a full kitchen. There is a washer and dryer which is handy. A/C and heat. It is very tidy and well-stocked. The bungalow is on a beautiful farm that is very scenic and has walking and hiking. It is close to Portage lake and many other hiking and biking trails. Or just sit out and relax and watch the sunset - the views are wonderful. The owner is very attentive and helpful. I hope to return again soon.
