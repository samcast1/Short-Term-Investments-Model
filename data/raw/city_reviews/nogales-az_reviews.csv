Stayed a few nights",Cheap and convenient. Only issue I had was the fact that I wanted to extend my stay and they let someone else book my room so I got screwed. They should give you the option to extend your stay before letting someone else book it. That’s what every other motel I’ve ever stayed in does.

Stayed a few nights","Jan's place was absolutely amazing! Check-in was a breeze and Jan was communicative and made the process simple. The condo was private, beautifully decorated, pristine, and every little detail was thought of to make my stay comfortable. The townhome is located in a quiet little complex with a great view of the Santa Ritas and a saltwater pool for relaxing. Beautiful sky deck and patio! My favorite part, though, was the easy access to the de Anza trail which I took for a very quick walk to Tubac then hopped onto for a hike to Tumacacori on the second day of my stay. The perfect location and all the amenities made this probably my favorite Airbnb I've ever stayed at!"

Sadly didn’t use either much as the weather was unseasonably cool and rainy, for late March in the desert. I highly recommend it..if you’re planning on visiting Tubac and Southern AZ. Jan is a very responsive host which I appreciated."

We enjoyed the village which in within walking distance, took yoga classes, ate at the golf course and did some sightseeing. Had a wonderful time."

Stayed about a week","Just what I needed: a comfortable, clean apartment with all the necessary kitchen tools. Close to the pool, Covered parking which was really nice on these hot sunny days. Nice Fitness Center too.
I liked being able to take my morning walks into Tubac and as a Tesla driver, I really appreciated that Old Presidio Traders in Tubac has a Level 2 charger available. I charged up there three times over my one week stay (I could leave it on the charger over night and it is only a 15 minute walk from Jan's place).
Jan sent daily messages with helpful suggestions of things to do in the area. I look forward to returning."

Jan's place was spotless and clutter-free, which made it easy for us to move in with our two dogs. (We especially appreciate being able to have our dogs with us for this two-night stay over 4th of July.) The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to prepare the meals we planned to eat in. Walking in the neighborhood is easy and lovely; the mountain views are relaxing and peaceful. We will recommend Jan's townhome to others."

Stayed with a pet","Have always heard about Tubac and wanted to check it out so we rented Jan's lovely townhouse. Barrio de Tubac area is very pretty with still alot of construction going on. The townhouses are very Santa Fe ish with beautiful southwestern colors. Jan's patio is very private with beautiful heavy metal gate upon entering and a beautiful metal entry door. The upper patio is perfect for morning coffee and pretty views. Mornings are cool there but heats up quickly. The townhouse is very nice, felt like being at home; kitchen is equipped with whatever you need; loved the under the cabinet lights in kitchen; nice refrigerator that makes ice; comfortable furniture and bed; loved the Meyer products; the shower was amazing, big tub; shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided by Jan. Plenty of room throughout the townhouse. Quiet neighborhood, friendly people; covered parking was a plus. Lots of dog walkers and plenty of places to walk and explore. Jan is an excellent host, quick to respond."

Stayed with a pet",Jan's place in Tubac is perfect in every possible way. I'm an Airbnb host and really appreciate the effort and respect Jan takes in her home and as a host. Caring communication was appreciated! Every inch of the place is exceptionally clean. The patio and the home have special touches that makes each area relaxing. Jan uses organic bath products and biodegradable cleaners too. Everything is at your fingertips for an peaceful stay. Jan pointed the Anza trail. Amazing state parks on each side of the trail you can walk to. Also a great way to walk into Tubac. Found the people and the food in the area welcoming. Looking forward to my next stay in Tubac. My dog loved the rooftop for her lookout.

The home is in a charming community and neighbors are delightfully friendly and waved and said hi whenever we walked by on dog walks. There are a few restaurants and a market within a short walk or drive. Instructions for check in and check out were clear and straightforward.
Jan was an excellent host, she checked in with recommendations and always responded quickly to my messages.
The current photos don't do this home justice, it's a real gem. If only all Airbnbs (and their hosts and housekeepers!) were like this one! :)"

Group trip","The house was great! It had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. It was very clean and well stocked. The beds were comfortable. Safeway was close by for a few provisions. The only surprise was the steep incine of the driveway. If you drive a low clearance vehicle, you would want to be aware of this as there is limited street parking in the culti-sac. The neighborhood was very quiet and the front patio is nicely arranged to enjoy a beautiful sunset above street level. Brian was a great host! Overall, it worked well for us! We really enjoyed the area and recommend visiting the nearby village of Tubac."

Group trip","We needed a four bedroom and this place suited our needs perfectly. It was clean, and it had extra like an iron that we needed. The living area had a couple of board games and an interesting book collection that suited every age group. The location was near a grocery store, gas station, and super breakfast restaurant. The neighborhood was easy to find and quiet. We would stay there again."

Our family enjoyed the fully stocked kitchen and the cozy living room. At night, even though there was a party across the street, our light sleepers were able to sleep well. In summary, great place, would stay again. Thanks!"

We liked that the kitchen is fully stocked with everything that you would need to cook meals and to store supplies if you were staying for an extended time period. The beds were also comfortable and our host labeled everything to make it easy to find things including the wifi password, etc. The house sits up on a hill at the end of a quiet cul de sac. I also liked that it was one level so it’s perfect if you are traveling with older adults that need to watch their steps. We would definitely stay again if we come back to Nogales."

Stayed a few nights","Perched on a hill with a beautiful sunny bay window that provides a view of mountains, sky, and the scattered homes below, this is not only a super clean, lovely place; it's an incredible value. Luanne lives up to her belief that travel should be simple, easy, and affordable. Everything one needs is provided. A compact, efficient kitchen. Plenty of space to relax, stretch out. Baskets thoughtfully placed everywhere you look, to store your belongings. Huge, comfortable bed in a separate bedroom with a sliding glass door that opens onto a back yard with another delightful view of distant mountains. This is a quiet, peaceful neighborhood with winding streets and very few cars. I appreciated most of all how fragrance free the entire home is. Free and Clear laundry products made the bedding and towels smell clean, not overly perfumed. The compact washer/dryer in the walk in closet was very handy, and didn't assault with overwhelming scent. My time there was to short, so I'll be back!"

The bed was soft and the mini splits did a great job warming the place (we were here for Christmas and it got down to the high 20°s at night). Appreciated the extras like epsom salts and bath bombs, and the extra toiletry kits for guests who may have forgotten their toothbrush etc. Plenty of storage in the form of bins and cubbies. Kitchen was fine for our purposes (early AM coffee and midnight snacks) b/c we had all our meals at nearby family members’ houses. Might have felt tough to do full self-catered meals for a family of four, but all the basics were present. We appreciated having a washer and dryer so we could do a load of clothes in the middle of our big road trip. Luanne was responsive to messages and I recommend this spot!"

Stayed about a week","Disappointed to see front yard landscape not maintained. Did not look like photos. The patio area in the back did not match photos. The grate in the grill was full of mouse droppings. Screen on sliding door difficult.
Needed help with heat function and messaged Luanne. She responded in an hour. We also said we would need more than the one dish towel for our week stay and we couldn’t open windows. She was in NM so sent her son the next day with towels and to open difficult windows.
When on the floor to level the fridge to keep it from rocking around we found debris underneath. There were half dozen mouse traps set in each room. We saw no evidence of mice in house.
The oven was very dirty and gave off bad odor the one time we used it. The two chopping knives were extremely dull. No paring knife. Hot pads dirty.
Needs TLC!
Positives: king bed comfortable. Lots of light in the unit. Lots of hot water for soaking in tub. Unscented laundry detergent as requested. Quiet location."

We selected Luanne’a place because of the location: sandwiched between two mountain ranges that had a lot of gravel biking (dirt roads) for us to ride. We explored both sides of the valley. The place was better than we expected- always comfortable and ALL of the amenities. Pretty much a full kitchen and not a single thing was missing. We kept commenting to each other how this place was so comfortable and one of our best AirBnB’s ever. Glad we came and of course wish we could have had one more day to relax. The view out the windows is nice and there are lots of sitting areas to relax or eat your breakfast.

The only critique is that there was an odd smell when we first arrived, but it started to go away when we turned on the air conditioning. Also, we could at times hear the tv and low conversations from the connected house. Overall, though, it was a peaceful, enjoyable stay. We would return. Thank you!"

Stayed one night","Luanne offered amazing hospitality before the trip, timely communication, and left a surprise personalized birthday gift for my husband (we were celebrating his bday). The home was stylish and modern and very clean! Loved the modern sensor lighting on step and in kitchen area...lots of updates to the home that made us feel as if we were staying at a high end hotel suite instead of a home. Was remote enough to have back private patio with great view but close enough to Rio Rico for us to grab some delicious Mexican Seafood (La Bocanita) which is about a 10 minute drive.
Luanne lives in the other half of the home and is very helpful and gives you your privacy along with a private parking spot and private entry so you aren't sharing the space with her if you prefer privacy.
We have a 6 year old and 1.5 year old and she put up with a lot of noise and commotion from them and made it as comfortable for our family as possible!
We went to Lake Patagonia the next day and plan to be back on our next trip to the Lake!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and kid wanted to leave on the first night due to spiders, a black widow spider inside the bedroom and even a small scorpion found inside. The place looked unkempt due to ""dust bunnies"" everywhere including under the bed. I called the host's number to complain about the spiders and her boyfriend or husband answered. I asked for Luanne and instead he kept talking. His response was, "" just leave, you can just leave"". That is the worst customer service that I have EVER received from a host. Asking a renter to leave in the middle of the night with a wife and a 6 year old is beyond rude. Anyway, she finally got on the phone before I lost my temper with that guy. I offered to drive down to Nogales and get some bug spray myself and she agreed to that. I came back and sprayed inside and around the outside of the house. Like I said I killed a black widow with the spray inside our bedroom. They did have a chimenea outside which we used but my family couldn't even enjoy the heat from it because they couldn't sit close to it, there were monster size black widows under the brick counter were it sat. The place was stocked with supplies well enough though. Unless these people can clean up their act, spray the place regularly for bugs and improve the upkeep I would not recommend this place to anyone with kids or family."

It was definitely off the beaten path, which the host is perfectly transparent about, but the driving is definitely an adventure in and of itself haha! My family enjoyed the wildlife we came across, like deer, cattle and coyotes. It sits atop a hill all on its own and it is peaceful & quiet. The home was clean. The southwest character of the home was on point with its decor choices. The kitchen is stocked w/ basic amenities. If you are looking for a peaceful retreat away from it all, then this is a wonderful rental
A few things to note, the primary suite shower does have two steps down & the shower head is not positioned above you, but rather at chest level. I was traveling with my 70yr old parents, so we had to move them to the bedroom with the twin beds that was adjacent to the other bathroom with a walk in shower & overhead spray, so that might be a consideration for persons w/ mobility concerns. There is no common room TV, but are in each room"

Todd and crew gave very clear instructions for all of our guests. The house was very cool and interesting. Our major complaint was the amount of mouse sign when we arrived. It seemed that the house had been cleaned but then left alone for long enough to get very dirty again from mice. Also wasn’t super clean, trash left in the garage and a fair amount of dust and cobwebs. We still had a great time and Todd and crew were extremely helpful all along the way."

The large fenced area, with the addition of a snake fence, was perfect for my two little dogs. They got to explore so many different smells and bugs they’d never experienced before, while staying safe. Both Willow dog & Jazz dog learned what cows were! So much fun!
Very grateful this beautiful place is dog friendly!
I hope other dog parents visiting this beautiful place are mindful of their dogs & pick up after them.
The hosts were always responsive, professional and friendly.
Very pleased with my experience!"

The chairs in the den were to die for comfortable!! I read for hours every day! Any questions I had were answered immediately by Todd and his team. They were amazing. I can’t wait to go back and soak in more peace and quiet and serenity!!!

The house itself is very cozy and clean, we felt right at home. It was really cool to see the cows and horses roaming around, along will all types of other wildlife. Will definitely be back in the future! 10/10!!! If you want to get away from it all and just slow down, this is the place."

Stayed with a pet","I needed a quiet place surrounded by nature as I’ve been grieving the recent loss of my spouse. This place was perfect! Not only does it have an interesting history with Astronomy, it is a beautiful and comfortable home.
We found many interesting & beautiful birds sitting in the courtyard & the huge back porch.
Our two smallish dogs enjoyed the large gated (and rattlesnake fence) yard. So many different and exciting smells for them!
Guests need to be mindful of picking up their dog’s poop. Upon arrival, I picked up a kitchen sized trash bag full of prior guest’s dog’s poop.
Access roads are all unpaved with steep inclines & declines. Guests should polish up on safe downgrading to lower gears while traveling on these roads.
After the first trip back & forth, it becomes much easier & even fun to make it to & from Patagonia, Patagonia State Park & Lake, Sonoita Creek Nature Preserve, Paton’s Center for Hummingbirds, etc.
I will definitely book this amazing place again!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is really cool if you are looking for peace and quiet in a beautiful setting. Really unique home with a few distinct spaces for relaxing indoors and outdoors. The property could be a little tricky to get to, definitely an all-wheel drive vehicle is ideal for the unpaved roads leading up to the place, but the host provided really detailed directions and our group was able to find it without a problem. We really appreciated how well-stocked the kitchen was with cooking supplies and that there was a big pile of firewood for us to use! Short drive to Patagonia Lake, Sonoita Creek natural area, and the town of Patagonia for activities and dining."

You do need all wheel or 4 wheel drive as recommended . The home was clean and comfortable with a beautiful beehive fireplace and super comfortable beds! We appreciated those! Games and books and fully equipped kitchen. The patio has a fire pit ,bbq and a gorgeous view of basically nothing! Peace and quiet. Hosts responds immediately and made sure we had all we needed. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","This is a very unique property sitting on top of its own hill with 360 degree views. Neighbors are very far away and few between, which provides for a great place to relax and enjoy the views. Very quiet. The only sounds were from cows wandering around, and other wildlife. We also saw a herd of deer hopping around.
The house is beautifully furnished and decorated, with everything you could need during your stay.
From the house, you can go west and enjoy the art and food in Tubac, or east, towards Patagonia Lake and the lively town of Patagonia.
It is about a 15 min drive to the nearest store, mostly on unpaved roads, so make sure to pack food on your way in."

Group trip","This was a really amazing property just minutes from Tubac. Situated on a hill to the west of town, this house has just amazing views of the Santa Cruz Valley. It's a pretty unique house - basically two separate apartments which share a pool and patio. One half is a two bedroom, two bath with full kitchen, dining area and family room and the other half is a one bedroom, one bath again with a full kitchen and living area. Open the patio doors and you can go between the two sides easily, but also you can have a lot of privacy between the two units. The pool and hot tub were really nice - simple to operate and there's even a full sauna! Watching the moon rise over the mountains while sitting out on the patio was just great!"

Group trip","On behalf of the bride and bridal party, we'd like to offer tremendous thanks to Tubac Property for allowing us to create such a special memory at this beautiful desert escape. As any typical bachelorette party, we kept the location a surprise. The bride entered the home with a blindfold and was smiling cheek to cheek not knowing what stood before her. Upon removal of the blindfold, her face became flushed and eyes were filled with tears as we greeted her with a confetti gun and a ""Bride to Be"" sash. It was the reaction we all wanted! Then began the tour of the property and everyone was stunned at the beauty, tranquility, and privacy of the home and especially the pool, jacuzzi, and fire pit area! The host made our stay all the more wonderful by ensuring we had everything we needed for a successful 3-day bachelorette getaway from essentials to a full propane tank for our steak dinner. I look forward to reserving future stays at this incredible BnB!"

One thing I think is important to know is that you are not able to get to the Master bedroom through the main house. You have to go outside just a couple steps to enter back into the home. This was more like a in-law suite, which can be great when traveling with another couple but not as good traveling with children.
Overall the view it has to offer and the outside space was wonderful!"

Stayed over a week","one of my favorite rooms so far.
I had the pleasure to be in different rooms so I speak out of experience.
It is mostly quiet here (except for the train coming by every day, but that is just something you have to deal with in Nogales) - when the air conditioner is on, it feels like you are in your own little space.
they have great air conditioners, a must
every shop is pretty close, no more than 5 minutes away from your room.
you can even walk to the stores if you feel you need to move a little bit.
it feels safe because you see the cleaning staff every day and the police station is not too far away.
this room has very comfortable beds.
another great deal is that door dash works in Nogales. there is no kitchen but a microwave and a refrigerator.
the internet is great.
the shower is hot and if you have any questions, you get a response almost immediately.
the hosts are doing everything to make you feel at home here!
every room has a roku TV with apps like hulu and Netflix.
I truly love it here.
you can get the rooms rather cheap, even for a monthly stay.
it is very close to the border, so a great place for a night two or two if you are planning to go to Mexico.
you guys are amazing!
thank you for all that you do, Kayla, Aaron and staff.
it is always a pleasure to be your guest!"

great internet, great price, good shower, wonderful bed.
my partner and I have spent the past months here in Nogales and are truly enjoying the wonderful, inexpensive rooms in this motel.
One of the best prices you can get, especially when you need to stay somewhere for a longer time.
the hosts go above a beyond to make sure you have a wonderful experience.
there is a fridge and microwave and a coffee machine - and a great air conditioner!
perfect for people like us wo need to work from home.
a few restaurants deliver here with Door dash as well.
I couldn't ask for a better place...
thank you, guys, for all you do!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a very nice stay at Paula’s condo. She was very responsive via email and answered promptly when we had a few questions over the course of searching for a place to rent and during our stay. She had the condo well-stocked for comfortable living and cooking, but it was not cluttered. Also, it was very clean, neat, and pleasant to live in while we visited the area. About one block away, there was a nice outdoor community pool and hot tub for our use and the use of other condo owners/visitors.
We enjoyed our stay and if we have opportunities to visit the Tubac area again we will contact Paula again."

I loved this location for remote work as a way to relax while still staying on track. The extra bedroom has a small desk perfect for getting some work done. The balcony and patio are also wonderful places to put in some time getting work done. This place is honestly immaculate and so well appointed you would thinks it's a wedding venue.
Will visit again."

A beautiful bottle of wine and pecans from a local nut company greeted us upon our arrival. We like coffee, Paula had fresh ground coffee waiting, the first day the coffee maker didn't work, she had a back-up immediately. Very reasonable for the accommodations, recommend highly."

Stayed one night","This was a totally functional space.
Pros: The check-in process was absolutely ideal--our door code was sent to us in advance, so within fifteen minutes of arrival we were unpacked and in our room! The communication from the staff was great. We were looking for a place to sleep before crossing the border in the morning and that's what this was. Best prices on the U.S. side of Nogales.
What to know: This is definitely a classic motel stay. Definitely not a 'Boutique' experience, nor necessarily ""nice."" Someone had definitely smoked in our room before and the smell lingered, we made sure to take absolutely everything out of the car at night, etc. This was the most expensive night of our trip into Mexico and certainly the most humble accommodations, but that's what you get when you book in the U.S.A. And like I said, still by far the best price we found for Nogales, AZ on Airbnb."

We had water leaking from the ceiling from the rain, and the bed got wet. Then my phones going off at like 2am after all of this fiasco asking me to log in and approver an alteration to my reservation. I told the host we are trying to sleep. We also asked for some more toilet paper, and clean towels and we were told because this is Airbnb that a half a roll of toilet paper and one set of towels is enough for the whole week.

You can sit on the patio furniture she has set up outside and just watch the view and get lost in the hills and beautiful scenery. Absolutely relaxing and peaceful home, me and my family loved it. She had all types of things to keep the kids (including me) entertained, from games and theatre chairs that fully recline, to a big tv with Netflix and movies. She even had condiments we could use and honestly anything you could think of was there. She responded super quick and was truly an AMAZING host! Thank you Karla for allowing my family to stay in your home, we can’t wait to visit next year! 😊🙏🏼"

Stayed with kids","What an amazing home!
Finding places to stay around Patagonia is always tough, so when we lucked out finding this place that met all our needs, I was certain there would be a catch. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong!
First, Karla is a wonderful host. Proactive and extremely helpful, she helped us plan our trip and made the stay completely stress-free.
The photos represent the house well, so what you see is what you'll get. There were also many extras, like jars of Keurig cups and various teas, that are always very appreciated. There's also a pass provided that allows you to enter/park at nearby Patagonia Lake State Park for free (daily passes are$15-$20 per car). We ended up using the pass 5-6 times over the week to watch sunsets, let our young kids play at the beach, and rent kayaks.
The house is great for families with kids, with lots of things to keep them occupied, and the outdoor patios and lounge areas provide the adults with spaces to decompress. Can't recommend enough!"

The location was amazing! Views to die for and so peaceful. We loved sitting out back in the afternoon and evening watching the sun go down and the stars come out. Also, we were just a few minutes drive to the lake.
The house itself was so nice. Very clean and lots of space. The kids loved the games and air hockey. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen big and well stocked.
If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Highly recommend!"

Group trip","Our stay at Karla's place was absolutely wonderful. The house was beautiful and had everything we needed -- and more! Karla was very responsive and friendly, and we felt at home immediately. Lake Patagonia is less than 10 minutes away. We went there multiple times with the pass that Karla generously provides. It's peaceful and there's lots to do! We will definitely stay at Karla's again if we're back in the area."

Stayed a few nights","We were 4 adults looking to spend Christmas birdwatching. Although the dirts around the house are limited to a few residents, the location is near Patagonia and the lake. Karla provided a free pass to the lake, which was much appreciated. The house was decorated for Christmas, a nice touch! The beds are quite comfortable and kitchen well equipped. We loved the big views from the hilltop. The yard area is problematic due to the stickers, but the house is surrounded by concrete, so we could access 360 degree views."

Group trip","Such a good deal! This was more than we needed and it wasn’t even very expensive considering it’s size and it’s beautiful surroundings. Karla was an exceptionally kind and responsive host. She also went out of her way to give us a parking pass to the nearby Patagonia Lake.
Altogether a very memorable stay.
Thank you, Karla!"

Our group loved the outdoor space and enjoyed the large TV, comfy beds, spacious bathrooms, and beautiful kitchen. We will definitely book again in the future!
It was about 30 minutes from Sonoita and 2 minutes from Patagonia Lake. Definitely recommend booking at Karlas place!"

Stayed a few nights","Karla's home is exceptionally beautiful and spacious--a veritable palace! The surrounding views--on all sides--are magnificent. The kitchen, bedrooms, and living space in general are comfortable and immaculate. There is even an indoor theater: a huge screen TV with comfortable movie theater seats, with almost every streaming app available for viewing. There is no better place for relaxing, enjoying nature or hiking in the surrounding areas."

Stayed with a pet",We felt right at home from the moment we drove in. There was an area wide power outage and Karla kept us up to date on the progress of the power company and when it was supposed to be back on. The outage lasted about 12 hours and Karla offered to take us out to dinner for the inconvenience. We really enjoyed our time there.

The most beautiful home with a beautiful porch and multiple seating areas so sit and look out at the beautiful views. So much space! Everything you could ever need! We had so much fun in the game room. Karla had the most beautifully decorated Christmas tree. Everything was amazing! I could go on and on. It was great for a big family to get together and just enjoy each other. Will be doing this stay again!!
