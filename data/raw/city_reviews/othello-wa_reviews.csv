In the description, it said that essentials weren’t provided, which I assumed were towels, but they had everything included in this nice place. We only stayed for the evening, but I would stay there again if I had a long trip out there. Thank you!!"

Stayed one night","Hannah’s listing is super host quality for sure! Such a beautiful location with peaceful surroundings, belt seating area outside, and an amazingly put together interior. It was an absolutely perfect spot for my mom and I after our 10 day road trip, about an hour from Palouse Falls (which is easy to get to from there), close to I90, and by far our favorite spot we stopped at on our trip!"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely LOVED our stay here! The home was very neat and tity, beautiful spot in the country surrounded by farm land. I don’t think I seen a single vehicle drive by our entire stay. Hannah is the perfect host, very quick and responsive with any questions and concerns we had. Her and her husband have a beautiful home with a full playground and basketball court that our children enjoyed. If we are looking for an air bnb in this area again, this will be the first place I will be booking. I cannot say enough good things about it."

While my husband was at work I was at peace, warm and safe in the country guest house. Cozy on the couch recliner with a book and watching movies. Will come again!"

Easy check in and great communication- we did have to use the email’s ‘get directions’ to find the place - for some reason my GPS didn’t recognize the address - but the home is beautiful and very inviting.

Stayed with a pet","We came into the area to do a couple days of bird hunting with a few dogs and some of our kids. The view of the area out the backyard was awesome and the golf course there is very nice with being fun to play. It was a great place for dogs with the fully fenced in back yard and the set up on the bottom floor. The kids didn’t go with us hunting the whole time but had plenty to do whether outside in the quiet neighborhood, board games, movies or the hot tub. Katie was responsive and very kind. We will definitely use the place again if we hunt in the area in December/January or want to come out to Potholes with the family in the summer."

Group trip","Exceptional home, perfect host, and memorable stay
We were enamored with this home. Unfortunately, some Airbnb listings fall short of their descriptions, but this home surpassed its portrayal. It was equipped with everything we could possibly need, from top-notch appliances to a kitchen stocked for creating delicious meals and beds that promised a good night's sleep.
The home included a fabulous hot tub that helped make our stay all the more memorable.
The home is beautiful, with many special touches, including beautifully decorated for the Christmas season inside and out. The Christmas tree lifted our spirits, especially since we rented the home because we were there for our brother's funeral in the neighboring community.
Katie was an exemplary host, communicating clearly and concisely and promptly answering our inquiries. She was accommodating, and a pleasure to interact with, and we hope to rent from her again."

Air BNB should make it easier to rebook a previous listing through its website. I had a lot of trouble both finding the property on the website and making the reservation. Which makes no sense because I have stayed there several weeks and it should have come right up. Fortunately she was very helpful in getting it properly sorted out.
I Should be able to rebook from a previous reservation but was unable to do so."

Nice little restaurant/bar across the street and access to potholes state park so very close and convenient. Two very small things would have made things just a little better.... a toaster in the unit and another side table next to the couch to set things such as a drink. Otherwise very clean accommodating place that we would certainly stay again.

The place was quiet at night despite being in kind of a congested area.
The main bed was comfortable, but the laundry detergent was very strong smelling and sensitive people might not like it.
The coffee is Keurig…bring what you like, unless you want to drink flavored coffees."

The place we have stayed in the past raised their prices substantially without offering any additional ammenities. Heather's place was PERFECT! Great house with everything we needed in a good location for us. Heather responded quickly to my questions, before during and as we left.
I will definitly stay here again this summer for more fishing with friends.
We also brought our dog last minute and Heather was very accomodating.
Two thumbs up!"

We've previously had some not so great experiences at other Airbnb stays, but I can't think of a single thing I could complain about staying at Gaylene's. Honestly, I wish I could teleport her place to some other places my son and I take road trips to. We were just here for my son to take his SAT so I doubt I'd have a chance to stay again, but if ever I'm in Moses Lake, this would definitely be the first place I check! You won't be disappointed!!!"

Stayed with kids","The Wonder Hut was a lovely gem to find in Moses Lake! Gaylene was responsive and friendly in all communication before and after our stay.
The recommendations for nearby activities was great, so my boys and I decided to head to the lake and the sand dunes on a whim and had a wonderful time.
The Wonder Hut was clean, beautiful, and fully equipped with what we needed—it was even nice to see some oatmeal proceed for breakfast! When it was time to leave after our stay, my boys didn’t want to leave “Mom, can we stay? I’m so comfortable here!”
Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","the apartment was spotless. the small, detached house is located on a main street, but it was very quiet with not many cars. The fold out couch was comfortable with a twin size mattress topper. The queen bed was also very comfortable. There was alot of storage, in case you would like to store your bags out of sight. there's a large laundry room and a kitchen with full size appliances. The bathroom was large too, with lots of storage. This place was great for us. it was about 30-40 minutes easy commute to the gorge for a concert. There are various restaurants from fast food to fancy, and much to do in Moses Lake. great place to stay for a concert at the gorge!"

I run an Airbnb myself and I know how difficult accommodating this request can be. We were in Moses Lake visiting a dying friend so we really needed some kindness. The motel we stayed in the night before was more expensive, not as nice or as quiet, but was already full the second night. Gaylene was a real life saver. I highly recommend Gaylene as a host. Her place is sparkling clean and well stocked."

It's very private. The bed and sofa bed are very comfortable. The AC unit kept the place blissfully cool. Everything's spotless. The shower is nice and had great water pressure.

Stayed with a pet","This is a very cute, warm, and welcoming cabin. It's situated in a nice little RV park that has a clubhouse for the kids to go play pool, darts, games, etc.
The cabin did comfortably slept us three plus one dog, and had everything we needed to get going and also settle down for the night.
My only comment is that it's not a place to ""spend time with the kids at the cabin."" It has very little family-living room. While the pictures do imply it's small- its even smaller. Otherwise it would be a wonderful place for two to relax."

Used sponge in kitchen
Filthy blinds
Floors made our feet literally black
Beach access means a boat ramp
and drive down the road inside a public access area in WA State Recreation area and NO beach
Resort means a recreation center
Check info sent day of not two days before
Coffee pot filthy
Musty smell we had to air out
Sawdust from cutting limbs all over picnic table
No water in view from cabin (a single wide tiny home/trailer) except very far back of the campground and ours was at the front w a view of the road and the trailer next to us and the office across from us
Amenities noted shampoo and conditioner but there was only a ""conditioning shampoo"" or I would have brought my own
Plastic glasses had a nasty film on the inside like they weren't washed and one glass had a hole burned into it
No ice in freezer, just ice trays in the cabinet"

We liked the location for proximity to Palouse Falls and the Potholes area. It's a bit close to a state road, but it's not a busy one and the place was quiet enough. Just right for two people; I could see it being a bit snug with more. The upstairs is a loft; accessible on knees or by crawling. The kitchen is well-equipped; the cooking stove is especially nice."

Also, no blankets so prepare to sleep cold. unless you have the heater on, then it is so loud you won't sleep anyways. but they were attentive when we had the strong smell of gas inside."

I have never seen a maintenance man arrive that fast for any occasion in my 52 years of living.
All of this coupled with being so close to family in Othello the price & the fact that all of my grandchildren are in Spokane.

Stayed a few nights","My Wife and I had a wonderful time staying here. We were in town attending the Dave Matthews Band weekend at The Gorge. Super easy drive (<1hr) to and from the venue, Jackie's AirBnb was so clean, spacious, and felt just like home. This might've been the highest attention to detail I have ever seen inside of an AirBnb. We could tell that Jackie put a lot of work into making this feel like home for her guests. For breakfast, we went to Iron Works, which is a very cool spot. We recommend going there if you are able. If you are attending a show at The Gorge and are looking for an AirBnb to stay at instead of camp, we highly recommend booking with Jackie. Great communication, easy to get to and into the home, and I almost forgot to mention, a SUPER comfortable bed.

Her instructions for check-in were clear and easy to follow, and she was a marvelous host - we asked for additional Keurig pods and she responded quickly and dropped off more before the end of the day. The bed is very comfortable, as is the pull-out sofa bed! Well-appointed bathrooms and kitchen. Would highly recommend staying here if you're looking to stay in the area!"

With two bathrooms and a nice sofa bed, 4 people can comfortably stay in this suite. The location is close to Columbia national wildlife refuge and an hour drive from Palouse falls which is a must see!

Stayed a few nights","I compared hotel offerings in the area to Erika's listing and was blown away by the value proposition. Erika contacted me soon after I requested a booking and after a brief chat the booking was confirmed.
Erika contacted me again ahead of our arrival to ask when we'd arrive. I said 7pm and we arrived at about 8:30pm. We arrived without the benefit of a phone call or GPS to confirm (due to cellular roaming restrictions), instead a knock on the door. Thankfully, it was the right door and Erika with her two beautiful and friendly dogs greeted us and showed us our room and the highlights of the living space.
I slept better in that clean/comfy/cool/dark bedroom than I have in years. Erika suggested a restaurant where I ate mole so good that my hometown mexican spots look like tacobell."

The Keurig and coffee were appreciated. The only negative was the heater being louder than we wanted and, at times, stuttering on and off. The host said she would look into it, and I trust she will. The home was about a 25 minute drive from the Othello Sandhill Crane festival location, so a bit of a drive. If you plan on boating in the reservoir, this is an amazing location. For us, the best place nearby for lunch or dinner is the The Beach House at MarDon. Across the street, the mini-mart has a surprisingly good breakfast, and also serves sandwiches and pizza."

I am an amputee so things are more difficult for me than for most but I knew that I wouldn't be able to get into the shower ahead of time and didn't need to shower the one night I stayed there. I loved the small touches and the obvious care they take of the place that showed forth throughout. It was a very comfortable bed and you could adjust the air temperature easily. I would highly recommend this place but would say that it is not the best if you are a wheelchair user and need to bathe.

They were super kind and allowed us to check in as early as we liked as no one was staying the night before. They were quick to respond and the place was clean and tidy.
Climbing the ladder to the up top bed is quite steep and a little scary but other than that everything was great!!!"

My kids had the best time in the pool, scootering around the neighborhood, and boating on the lake. The neighborhood seems very safe and it was fun to take walks at night. There are a lot of golfers driving golf carts around and kids playing in the area. The neighbors seemed very nice. The houses behind can see the pool area but we hardly noticed anybody around and everyone keeps to themselves it seemed. The house is really well laid out with comfortable beds, lines, and furniture. The pictures don't do it justice and the views are really pretty at sunset. The kitchen is well stocked and lots of towels and pool supplies! Thank you Lisa for the wonderful stay! We would definitely book this place again. For local suggestions the Mar Don restaurant is super tasty with a great boat launch."

It was clean, the beds were super comfortable, rooms had lots of space (with Kind beds!), and there was plenty of space and seating to enjoy the common areas. We unfortunately had wildfire smoke so we couldn’t fully enjoy the back patio space but it’s right off the golf course with a nice pond. Perfect place to spend an evening. Golfers are friendly, and even quite hilarious as they ride by. We had a lot of fun here.
