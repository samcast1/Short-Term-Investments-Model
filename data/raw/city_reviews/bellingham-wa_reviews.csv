The location is excellent with restaurants and stores within walking distance; it was also a short drive to all the sightseeing areas. We loved having the projection TV to watch movies and shows, since we stayed during a rainy weekend. For those who are sensitive to noise, the house is next to a busy road, but the owners have provided earplugs for sleeping."

Stayed with kids","Wonderful Airbnb!! Spacious, clean, comfortable, well-lot and well-decorated. Loved it all- bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom… As others have mentioned, the back entrance looks sketchy but once you’re inside, it’s beautiful. There’s some noise from the cars on Girard St but wasn’t a big deal for us, and earplugs were provided. We liked hearing the occasional train go by. As we were traveling with an infant, we really appreciated the fridge/tons of kitchen counter space (we didn’t cook, just reheated pizza) and washer/dryer. There are lots of books and some toys for older kids too! A pleasant walk to downtown Bellingham, and closer walk to the Fountain district businesses.
(Tip esp if arriving after dark: The house is on the corner of I and Girard, and the driveway is off Girard St. As described in the instructions, but we missed it.)"

It worked well for a girls’ trip away as we enjoyed the space of each having our own room but also had the cosiness of the tv area and kitchen to share meals and good conversation. Walking to restaurants and shops downtown was a easy 15mins and the hosts provided a good list of cafe, brewery and restaurant options. Thank you, Lindsy and Eli!"

Stayed with kids","One of the best places we’ve stayed with our child so far! He’s 4 and this place had some toys and books he could enjoy as well as very little clutter or things he could break. This allowed for a much more relaxed stay for all of us as my husband and I didn’t have to be overly vigilant to keep him out of things he shouldn’t be in. Definitely a place I consider family friendly.
I also appreciated the advanced communication from Lindsy and Eli because I knew what to expect when we got there. They also provided an excellent resource for things to do and places to go."

Lots of kitchen amenities - variety of pots, pans, cooking essentials, seasonings/sauces, DISHWASHER - great for people who love to cook away from home! Be aware upstairs residents will be home sometimes, but we basically never heard them and no one came into or approached our space (or even our entrance and car).
No issues with stay."

The outside and entry in the back weren't quite what we expected, but once you're inside it's a beautiful lower level apartment. There is train noise, but it's not super close and didn't bother us with our sound machine for our baby. There was lots of toys, an infant tub, and books for little ones which was a nice touch."

Stayed with kids","This was a lovely space to stay in for an extra-long weekend in Bellingham. The beds are extremely comfortable, and the kitchen, bathroom and laundry are all modern, clean and spacious. My family really appreciated the video projector and how easy it was to navigate. We held off on watching a movie, expecting it to be complicated, and when we finally sat down to watch one, it couldn't have been easier. My kids especially loved the record player. The space is a short walk to a great coffee shop and a few restaurants and only slightly longer walk to downtown. Lindsy and Eli left great recommendations for restaurants, bars, and coffee shops that we took advantage of during our time. I definitely recommend Bellingham and this house for a visit!"

Stayed with kids","We recently stayed at the bottom unit and overall, it was a good experience. The location was walkable to downtown Bellingham, but we found it challenging to find a good way to navigate with a family and stroller. Being close to Elizabeth park and having a parking spot were definite highlights for us.
At first, it was a bit tricky to figure out how to get into the unit, but we managed. We weren't bothered by the street noise or train noise that others mentioned. The children's items and toys was a lovely touch, as we were traveling with a 5-year-old and a 1-year-old who shared a room.
The host responded quickly to any questions we had."

It's a little funky on the outside but once you get in, it's so peaceful with lots of light & space. It is a little noisy being on a busy street but the street quiets down at night, thankfully. Our teenager geeked out over the record player & we had fun watching soccer on the big projection TV. We will definitely stay here again if we make it back to Bellingham!"

The TV being a projector was also a nice touch, as it allows for the room to feel light & airy when not in use.
The home is also sunny while staying cool, and is nicely laid out. If it does get warm, the ceiling fans are a big help.
It’s near to local businesses & the parking is easy to get in & out of.
If needing a place to stay in Bellingham in the future, I’d consider staying again."

Stayed a few nights","This was SUCH an adorable place for us to spend the night. We walked in and immediately smiled seeing all the personality this place had to offer. The record player and stack of vinyl records were immediately put to use. Frank Sinatra helped us unpack. Our hosts sent us a lovely list of all the great places to eat dinner, grab a beer, enjoy a coffee, and spend some time outdoors. After we had dinner we came home and popped some popcorn and enjoyed a movie on the big screen. What a fun surprise to get to enjoy. Bonus - the couch is super comfy! We appreciated the fans for each room. We slept with the windows open for fresh air and felt entirely safe. Bellingham is a gem. Excited to go back some time."

Our only small issues were: the multiple doors/door codes was a little confusing until we got the hang of it. The street it’s on is very busy and noisy due to being near the police station so not ideal for hanging out outdoors.
Overall, we were happy with the spot!"

Although there are other people living on the upper floor, they were very quiet and we had no issues with them at all."

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at Lindsy & Eli’s. Everything was modern and updated, we especially enjoyed the large rooms, the record player, and the great local recommendations.
My only call out is echoing previous posts about noise in the bedrooms. The house is on a Main Street and while we didn’t really notice any noise during the day, it was noticeable at night especially with police cars going with sirens going past.
Otherwise we had an amazing trip, with great help from Lindsey & Eli on local recommendations. I would definitely stay there again."

The location is close to downtown restaurants and shopping and there’s a wonderful yoga studio just a few blocks away! The beds were very comfortable. We mostly were out and about but on the rainiest evening, it was great to relax on the sectional and watch shows via the projector! As described, it is on a busy street so you can hear some traffic noise but we didn’t find that to be a problem. We would happily stay there again when in Bellingham."

WE didn't remember ours PWords to cable/netflix/amazon prime all of which became annoying."

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and I have to say this was one of the best. The space is wonderfully designed, spotlessly clean, and equipped with high end appliances. The house was quiet, receives a lot of light, and is a 5 minute drive to downtown Bellingham. It has its own dedicated parking space (actually two!) conveniently located next to the back door. And best of all, the bed (it has two- I only used one), was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in, and the bedding was super high quality. I mention this because this is usually not the case in many Airbnb’s. But I slept great both nights I was there because the hosts made this a priority for their guests. I will definitely be back."

We felt like we were at the movies. Both bedrooms were comfortable, with bedside lamps, charging stations, and even ear plugs!
We were only a mile from shops and restaurants in Bellingham. We visited Neko cat cafe (recommend), grabbed a few groceries from Grocery Outlet (to go with the yummy Samish Bay Cheese we got on the way up), and then had a delicious brunch at the Mount Bakery. We were about a ten minute drive to Fairhaven, where we hit up Village Books.
It was a quick stay, but I would definitely like to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","Our group was up for the weekend to show some friends around Bellingham. My husband and I are WWU alumns so we love visiting bham, very nostalgic for us. This property is so nicely updated and is the perfect property for 4 people. We were able to walk to some of our favorite spots (Elizabeth Station and Wander Brewing) and it only look a little longer to walk downtown. We would definitely consider staying at this place again on our next trip to bham. We had a couple questions during our stay at the hosts were quick to respond. Thank you Eli & Lindsy!"

The finishes that they have done in the AirBnB are the best. Parking was not an issue, we had either street parking 4 steps from the front door or an assigned spot about 100 feet from the front door, the parking was great. They gave us some GREAT restaurant recommendations and we tried them all but one, only because it was raining and outside. All of the places we went to eat were within walking distance of the AirBnB and many others. It was a great location. We found a favorite coffee shop, Hammerhead Coffee, just two blocks away. This was a relaxing enjoyable time away from home which was just what we were looking for, it couldn't have been better!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall, the apartment was as nice as it appeared in the picture. The kitchen was great. The spaces were well thought out, comfortable and relaxing. Every thing was very clean.
Really the only issue we had was the noise coming from the tenant above on our second night. We got back to the apartment around 1AM & music from above was loud enough to hear & there was heavy thumping like running intervals on treadmill. The noise kept up until around 3am. It was impossible to get to sleep until it finally went quiet upstairs. The loss of sleep did impact the rest of our stay.
In communication with Adam afterwards, he said: 1. First time he has had a noise issue & would check in w/the tenant; & 2. I should have felt free to call in the middle of the night to address the issue. In retrospect calling him seems reasonable but at 2am it did not.
With no prior review comments, this was likely new. So, now you know. Call if it is a recuring problem."

For a relatively small area, there were nicely separate areas for sitting and chatting, doing work, having a meal and, of course, sleeping. The location is very convenient for getting to restaurants and cafes and shops but surprisingly quiet for being on a corner. We will definitely stay here again as long as our son is at WWU!"

The bed is super comfortable, the desk great for work (including room for an extra monitor) and extra USB charging cables were there in case you needed one.
The location is fantastic as you can walk everywhere. Two blocks to three places to get coffee and the Co-op grocery store. So many great restaurants, breweries and cocktail bars are within a 5-10 min walk.
Thanks for your hospitality!

Adam and Kathryn's place hits high marks on value - walkable location, quiet and clean, clear instructions, comfortable and stylish. It had one of the few kitchens I've come across that actually had all the items I needed to make dinner. Laundry was easily accessed and much appreciated. Bed was very comfortable!
I needed a place to stay for the week while displaced from my own apartment due to plumbing problems, and was simultaneously tarting a new job, so my stress level was high but this stay made things SO much smoother. I really appreciated being able to feel at home, cozy and safe in this unit. Would highly recommend for out of town travelers needing accommodations that are easily walkable to the downtown highlights, it should meet all of your needs."

There are so many little extra things they did to make the space inviting: welcome basket of goodies, coffee station, homey decor and furniture, trail maps of local parks, Brita pitcher, available laundry, perfectly clean and modern kitchen and bathroom. And it's 2 blocks to the best groceries and a short walk to several good breweries and dozens of restaurants. I loved my 5-day stay there - it was so cozy. I could occasionally hear the upstairs neighbor, but it didn't bother me. It made me feel safer. Adam was also responsive to questions. Nothing was a surprise.

Which lead me to feel as though the apartment wasn’t cleaned as thoroughly as it could have been, maybe a rushed cleaning. So that would be my one critique to just pay a little more attention to those details. As it can make all the difference to someone’s stay."

It was a perfect size for two people and very comfortable. The wi-fi was very fast and stable for working remote throughout the week, and the location was excellent with plenty of good food and drinks nearby and within walking distance. If travelling to Bellingham in the future I would not hesitate to stay here again."

There was an error - on my part completely - with my reservation but it was handled with such grace and kindness that I would highly recommend staying here!! Amazingly very very quiet for its location. Be sure to enjoy a glass of wine in the backyard well worth it I will totally be back - after I double and triple check my reservation!!

Stayed one night","I traveled to Bellingham for a non-recreational, somewhat stressful purpose. What I most vividly remember, three days later, about my stay at Emma's is that I arrived stressed out and fifteen minutes later felt better. Sure, part of that was from simply getting there, but it also came from the space being welcoming, clean and authentically well-styled, for my tastes anyway. Emma really goes the extra mile with the little touches. A washer and dryer with detergent available, snacks, lots of spices and a plentiful amount of quality toiletries. Her place is exactly as her lengthy description of it portrays.
There is another unit upstairs that was occupied when I was there. Don't know if it is permanent housing, but the people there shut all the noise down by the 9 p.m. quiet curfew.
Wish I could've stayed longer to get in a good, relaxing soak with that claw-footed tub."

Stayed a few nights","Check-in was very smooth and the space was very clean. We enjoyed the space and the amenities that were provided. Everything has helpful and easy to follow instructions, this made it so we didn't feel like we were doing anything incorrectly. Lastly, as just a precaution and not a complaint. If you play the piano you may want to switch the stool for one of the dining chairs. The stool is very old (which fits the aesthetic perfectly) but because of that it is very unstable. I nearly fell out of it a few times! But we had a great time and it was well worth the price. Emma was very communicative and pleasant. We would absolutely consider staying again the next time we come to Bellingham. Thank you Emma!"

The only bummers were that the house never really got warm, despite the additional space heaters, and the sound of the upstairs neighbor walking the stairs and floors was pretty loud late at night. Just some things to note if you’re sensitive to those issues. It’s charming old home that comes with some quirks. Emma was a perfect host and communication was great!"

I would say the only thing that wasn't great about the place was the heat. I basically hung out in the bedroom with the door closed to stay warm. The wall heaters somewhat heat the space, but they are working non-stop. I realize it is hard to heat an older home with really tall ceilings. I did also really appreciate that the place was dog friendly. Thanks!"

So many little touches that made the experience exceptional. She has a full line of natural, organic skin and body care products (oils, creams, and lotions) for you to experience. Candles and bath salts for soaking in the clawfoot tub were the cherry on top!
We appreciated her mindfulness of not using perfumed, chemical-based cleaners.
The bed was very comfortable.
The kitchen had everything we needed, and the outdoor grill was a real bonus.
The Co-op was across the street, which made getting groceries very easy. Multiple coffee spots are within a short walk.

At first the location seemed kind of weird because it looked like it was behind a gas station - and it is, but the cute cottage garden has lots of tall plants and privacy so you can't even tell when you walk inside. The location was excellent too - it took me less than a minute to walk over to the delicious cafe next door in the morning, and they open early so it was very convenient with the baby! I highly recommend this spot, and I'll check it out the next time I'm back in town."

Tastefully decorated with lots of space and thoughtful touches wherever you look. The house is so close to the city (shopping and restaurants), but feels like a quiet oasis with the surrounding gardens and landscaping. This trip was a very brief one, but I'll certainly put this one on my list for future visits!"

Stayed one night","My partner and I lived in Bellingham for seven years and thought we might stop by on our way to BC. As soon as we pulled in and realized the location and saw the house, we stared at each other in disbelief. I mean it when I say it is in the actual perfect location. I could only dream of living in that spot when we lived in Bham.
We were honestly just looking for a simple place to crash, but then we fell in love the space and all of the incredible little goodies and details throughout it that it turned what was supposed to be a night out bar hopping into just dinner and a drink. All we could think about was how much better it sounded to relax in that lovely space, so that's exactly what we did. We made the short walk back home, drew a bath with some lovely soaking salts, made cocktails with the syrup mixed, put on some records, and had the most relaxing evening I have had in quite some time.
This spot restored my faith in AirBnb. It was genuinely the best part of our entire weekend."

Stayed a few nights","A fantastic gem of vacation rental a stone's throw away from downtown Bellingham. It's close enough to walk to the amazing restaurants and breweries Bellingham has to offer but at the same time, feels tucked away in its own little enclave. The rental is much bigger than it appears in photos, incredibly spacious for a long weekend getaway. Emma definitely checked all the boxes with the amenities. The kitchen is incredibly well stocked with cookware and tools, not to mention the great selection of teas! The handmade soap/bath products throughout the rental are amazing, the sea salt texture spray was my favorite. Given that this is the downstairs of a duplex vacation-stay and an older home, we expected to hear more noise from the upstairs vacationers, thankfully it was very quiet. Would happily stay here again next time visiting the Bellingham area."

Stayed one night","I loved the kitchen and the tea selection and the actual house (high ceilings, big rooms, lots of light).
The place is lovely but it has a few too many quirks for the price. The shower curtains don't fully surround the shower, so the floor gets super wet every time. The kitchen-bathroom door didn't stay open without a lot of work, both bathroom doors don't close without a lot of effort, the bedroom-bathroom door doesn't have a lock. The bathroom windows didn't have curtains, which meant if you wanted an open window to let out the steam, you were looking straight into the windows of the neighbours house. The cutlery drawer in the kitchen is a bit dodgy and sticks a lot. This combined with the constant reminders about their wish for a 5 star review, the huge list of house rules and the massive number of notes/instructions around the house made me feel pressured and stressed. If it had been $100-200/night, I'd be more forgiving but this cost $345. Many of these issues could be fixed for future guests.
Also the noise from upstairs was quite loud and very early (screaming and stomping of children above us at 6am) - we were aware this could be an issue, but it still impacted the quality of our time at this Airbnb."

The only recommendations I have is for a coffee machine, as I open my eyes early and already looking for a coffee. There is a French press,but that is no real coffee for me. The other thing is - no sink in the bathroom, so shaving for my husband was a hustle. Those are small things,but with them the place would be perfect. The location is great. It's on a quite Street, close to Starbucks, groceries, markets. The garden with bbq and chairs outside is awesome. We really enjoyed our stay there. We were lucky it didn't rain, so we spend our evenings outside. The fridge is tiny, but enough for 2 people. There are chickens separated by a fence, so much fun to watch them. The price is right. I would return. There are so many wonderful hikes in the area, it's unbelievable and we had a wonderful time at this place."

- no artificial fragrances, natural cleaning products, soap, shampoo etc
- surprisingly well-stocked kitchen w/ a hot plate, toaster oven, sharp knife, etc - yet everything fits in the cupboard so it's not cluttered
- beautiful outdoor space that really did feel private
Obviously, this airBnB is a labor of love and has been set up with a high attention to detail that really shows. It's a great location and I highly recommend checking out Whatcom Falls if you decide to stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed for roughly a good amount of time with my partner. Then, later I find myself alone for the time-being.
This was a great private and small space for one or two people. I noticed the care in providing the space that was well-cleaned, provided with booklet instruction that shows the locals recommendations and history of the house. I was able to message request from Nathan for their time to receive foil for the oven stove and enjoy my small meal. The kitchenette is something I am at awed about how it was organized and well hidden inside the drawers. The blanket, and beddings to the wall of arts prints is a beautiful sight and cozy.
Throughout the experience, I was greeted by the morning to seeing the chickens and hens and the weather from rain-snow to do my exercise and come back for the night to have my full rest and watch some shows.
For that, I left a note to Nathan and Anna to thank you and leaving a review here as well."

Stayed one night","We could tell our hosts were kindred spirits: from the friendly elderly chickens we got to visit, to the recycled brown paper towels. We even share taste in household furnishings: we have the same Japanese design bed frame at our place, and a similar red and black Native American design blanket. Lots of little delights, it was therefore just what we needed during a time of stress, since we were in town for medical reasons. The hosts were balanced in respecting privacy and offering any needed support. We will be back, hopefully to have more fun."

Our baby also loved the place, she is a 13 month walking curious kiddo that explored all the corners, so we really appreciated the lack of clutter and the cleanliness of the place...important stuff when you have a baby with you! The deck was amazing, loved being there and listening to the sound of nature and admiring the trees. Lovely location!"

essentials in the kitchen were covered, bath products were top notch, comfortable couches and bed. couldn’t get over the string lights beautifully laid out over the bed. Ariel is extremely friendly, responds on time and ensured that we were comfortable throughout the duration of our stay. Local recommendations for food / hiking from her helped a lot in our planning. We miss waking up to the peace & quiet that the treehouse offered - truly a magical and serene experience :) 100% would recommend."

Ariel's attention to detail is unmatched. All of the little things ( soaps, Lotions, lighting, books) are amazing.
The bed is so comfortable. The atmosphere (vibe) is very relaxing. The host is an amazing person. Do yourself a favor and stay in the beautiful tree house."

The place was exactly as depicted in the pictures, and even more charming in person. I appreciated the thoughtful touches, such as a folder full of recommendations and fun facts, adding a personal touch to my experience. One unique feature was the opportunity to pin my location on a map, a fun way to connect with other travelers.Terry and Kerry went out of their way to ensure I had everything I needed, and the delicious cookies were a sweet surprise that I truly enjoyed. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, as the overall experience was fantastic.
The only minor note is that if you arrive in the dark and aren't familiar with the area, locating the road can be a bit challenging. So, I recommend approaching with caution and going slow. Additionally, I did hear the garage, but it didn't bother me since I was already awake. Overall, a lovely stay with gracious hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay. Everything was as described. It's a great value, and there were a number of nice homey touches (like cookies, a nice garden, and a backyard swing) that helped the place feel like a proper ""B 'n' B."" I would recommend to friends on a budget looking for a nice ""home base"" while exploring the area. One little note: While there were some nice accessibility features, I'm not sure the shower would work great for bigger folks, as it's quite small inside. Overall, though, this was a great stay for us. I would definitely book again."

They have the most amazing property with beautiful flowers, a garden, and the best backyard swing. It swings you over a hill and about 15 feet in the air. We plan to stay with them every time we visit Bellingham in the future. Great people & our best Air BnB stay yet!"

Terry and her husband were such friendly, cool and welcoming hosts with such fascinating lives that you just want to be friends after meeting them! They have a beautiful home and garden that’s extremely peaceful and private. We were greeted with flowers and greenery that was serene. The ‘Aloha’ suite itself reminded us of our stay in Hawai’i and we truly felt like we were on vacation while staying there. Everything was clean, with amenities in the unit clearly labeled and well appointed. There were delicious fresh baked oatmeal cookies for us when we arrived. Terry provided us with helpful advice for our hike in the area and lended us some micro spikes for our shoes in case there was snow on the trail. We only wished we had more time to spend at Terry’s home as our time there was limited with a busy hiking itinerary and hope we can return again soon! It was a far better experience than staying in a hotel."

This is an Airbnb where you can tell the hosts genuinely love providing hospitality and they go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. Everything is so clean and comfortable. The drive to downtown Bellingham takes about 15 minutes which is more than worth the extra peace and quiet the property provides. We would happily stay at the Aloha suite again!

Stayed one night","Terry’s place was a nice little getaway outside the city of Bellingham. It was quiet and peaceful with beautiful natural surroundings. Terry was very welcoming and provided a good orientation and then left us with the privacy that we appreciate. There were a few dusty corners and the floor seemed to bulge in spots. The furniture was a bit small for a tall person and the kitchenette area was limited, so I wouldn’t expect to be able to make any meals in this unit (only an issue if you make some of your own meals while traveling). Overall we enjoyed our stay and it was a good value."

On the way, we drove on Chuckanut Drive. The next day we went to Birch Bay area. The following day, we went to the Fairhaven District in Bellingham and visited the many parks and lakes in the area and not far from this Airbnb. The hosts were excellent and offered ideas on where to visit and have a meal. The room is filled with many brochures and maps to guide you as well. We found the room and space just right for our needs and used the outdoor BBQ for our meals. If we are ever in the area, we would not hesitate to rebook this place. Thanks for all the treats too!"

Stayed over a week","Terry and Kerry are really wonderful hosts and lovely people. They had me over for dinner one evening, and were always offering to help or pick something up in town if I needed. The space was very comfortable - everything was clean, extremely well-stocked for a small space, and Terry provided me a small work desk (since I was staying for a month while working remotely) and a portable AC unit during a brief heat wave. The bed was very comfortable, the shower had great water pressure, and the wifi held up nicely for my full-time work schedule (late in my stay it had a few hiccups, but still functioned and the hosts got the provider to come and address the issues promptly, and I was able to use my phone as a hot-spot to fill any gaps). Even though the kitchen is small, I was still able to get creative and prepare almost all my meals at home. The neighborhood is beautiful and has a couple nice walking routes, with many gorgeous hikes a short drive away. I'd definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","This was my first time staying at an Airbnb. And I absolutely loved it! They really went above and beyond for my boyfriend and I (my boyfriend is currently on crutches with a broken leg)
We woke up the next morning to atleast a foot of snow (maybe more) covered my entire car and then some… If it weren’t for Terry and her very helpful and handy husband, my car would have never gotten out of there and with the snow storm we had for several days on end, who knows how I would have gotten my car out.
It was very cold and slippery out but that did not stop them from being knee deep in the snow, shoveling snow out from under my car and even pushing it by hand.
I truly appreciate and am really grateful. I would highly recommend and definitely see myself staying again."

I was so relieved to find this home with Terry and Kerry. I truly felt we were staying with an Ohana (family). It was super nice to have some coffee and cookies for the morning, and the home was very quiet all evening. Thanks again!"

We enjoyed the walking trail just two blocks up.
Our pup was very comfortable, but word of warning, a section of the fence is collapsing where a dog next door wanted to fence fight. We avoided that side of the yard. I hope Ian fixes it, as we'd love to come stay again."

While the house is on a fairly busy road and adjacent to I-5, the road noise was not bad and the house is located in a nice neighbourhood with close access to a walking trail.
The hosts were incredibly welcoming and made us feel right at home. Communication was prompt and clear, from the initial booking to any questions I had during my stay.
The house itself was tastefully decorated and clean. The attention to detail was evident in every corner, from the cozy living space to the well-equipped kitchen.
Overall, my stay fully met expectations, and I would highly recommend it to others."

Upon walking in, it feels like home - it's comfortable, unpretentious and has everything we need for a relaxing visit with our daughter, son-in-law and granddog who live in Fairhaven. We all spent a lot of time playing in the backyard with our dogs, we picked very ripe blackberries, and used the house for relaxing after all our Bellingham and Vancouver adventures.

Alabama St. can be busy. I was happy that I bought a cookie tray with me, but the rest of the kitchen set-up was fine. The ""log"" heater was nice, made for good atmosphere, and warmth. The trundle bed was loudly squeaky for having all the beds in one room, but comfortable enough. We had 5 people sharing dinner and playing games, and we did not feel squashed. We did not ride the bikes (wheels needed some air and it was rainy), but they were a very nice amenity. There is a nearby walking path that we used with our dog. The check-in and check-out was easy. Did not need the owners but felt that they would have been responsive if I did. I definitely would stay here again."

I loved the couch! Very Comfy. The bed wasn't great for my back b/c too soft but might be wonderful for others. My only issue was that the oven was full of oil or drippings and the entire place got smoked out when I tried to use it. This also was on top, on the stove. I had to spend some time cleaning that. Host's manager did offer to come and clean it but once I live somewhere [I stayed for a month], I prefer my privacy and wished it was properly cleaned before arrival. It's overall described accurately and the manager was super responsive. Neighbors are super nice and helpful."

Stayed with a pet","We had a nice stay at Sara's place! The house is great for a couple or small family. The location is convenient - a couple of mins drive from everything in Bellingham. It's on a busy street as others have mentioned and near I5 so there is a bit of traffic noise, but it quiets down at night. Sara was very communicative! There are a few things I would improve - I think that the decor, linens etc. could be upgraded. It all feels a bit thrown together especially for the price. But, overall a great option for a trip to Bellingham and awesome that you can bring your dog!"

I also used one of the bikes this time and LOVED it! I took it up to the railroad trail at the top of the street, and biked every morning. One of the mornings I biked to Whatcom park and saw the waterfalls. That place is gorgeous. You shouldn't miss it.
Communication was quick and easy, and the host was very accommodating. Don't hesitate - rent this place. You won't be sorry."

The kitchen equipment includes dishes, coffee maker/ electric tea kettle, very basic pots & pans, salt & pepper. It’s very light on extras, so BYO for spices, vinegar, oil and the like.
We were there during the week of snow and very cold temps that ended with a windstorm. I was so pleasantly surprised by how toasty warm and comfortable this little cottage was, complete with a gas-fireplace —cute pot belly stove style.
What a welcome refuge from the wintery weather!
PS—loved all the pet friendly touches, although we ended up leaving our dog behind at the last minute. The dog-friendly front entrance/mud room is a super sweet touch."

The location can’t be beat! It is in a residential neighborhood and pretty quiet. But it is a five minute drive to most places, maybe 10 minutes to Fairhaven. We were able to go hiking in the mornings and go to great restaurants and shopping in the afternoon. There’s a couple nights that we stayed in and made dinner. They left candy for a movie night. So my daughter give this house five stars! The Internet was fast and we were able to stream movies. All in all… A Perfect little getaway. Thank you to Sara and Ian for being such wonderful hosts!

Stayed a few nights","This place was terrific. We were visiting to see Western Washington University, which is a short drive away. While we were in the house, we cooked several meals, which was very easy to do, because Trader Joes was about a block away! Also, a great burger place, delicious Thai food and bubble tea joint! Yay!
The bed was really comfy and my daughter wanted some privacy, so she slept on the couch, which she said was as comfortable as a bed.
Communications were smooth and easy. Check in was no problem at all. I just used a lockbox with a key.
She provided two bikes, but we were enjoying ourselves in the house so much, we never even got out on the bikes! I did go for several walk, however, on the FABULOUS path about three blocks up from the house. So nice. And in September - I picked buckets of blackberries and made cobbler. Yum!
Oh - and we brought our dog. She loved the fenced in back yard. She sniffed around happily. The house was very welcoming and comfortable for the dog. She is an old lady (12 years old) so she needs to be comfortable."

We used Sara’s house as a base for doing a brewery tour after a long day of hiking. Her place was within walking distance to 3 breweries and restaurants. Highly recommend! Also, check out Homeskillet for some delicious breakfast and crazy decor. We can’t wait to return!"

This property delivered – you could go down to the water or take advantage of multiple decks and the view - fabulous!
The kitchen was also stocked with EVERYTHING you could possibly need.
The bedding was soft, radiant heat was comfortable, and everything was spotless.
Carol does note the train in the listing, which at first, gave me pause. But, I am glad I chose this listing. The view, the neighborhood, the home and the host make this an excellent choice.
I hope to be back and stay for two weeks next time!"

She has truly done an amazing job creating an oasis near town. The house is done with tasteful, comfortable furnishings and every amenity you could want. Little touches like eggs, milk and pastries left for us - to comfortable blankets to take out and snuggle up on the deck and watch the sunset were everywhere!
The trains do go by (but that is unavoidable if you want to be in this area of Chuckanut or Bellingham.) The house did not shake or anything as the trains went by- but you can hear them and should look elsewhere if that would be an issue for you. We had no issues with it whatsoever!
We didn't want to leave the property! We didn't go to dinner or even really shop- we just sat on the deck and watched boats go by! Great for our spirits but not our to-do list! Thank you Carol!"

From the friendly welcome, to the history of the home, to the special touches, every bit of our stay was great. The place was very clean, the kitchen had everything we needed and more, and the bathrooms were clean and included complimentary toiletries. The outdoor area was peaceful and beautifully manicured. We spent a lot of time on the deck, enjoying the beautiful view, watching the birds, and listening to the waves. There are several seating areas as you make your way down to the water level and the grounds along the way are beautiful. We had a day where the tide was out pretty far and we were able to explore; we even saw a deer walking along the beach. Getting to Fairhaven, outdoor activities, and restaurants is easy. We are already planning our return trip!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our second glorious visit to Carol's beautiful home on Chuckanut Bay. We loved every minute of it! We actually went to heal from a Celebration of Life after the passing of my sister and her husband. It was the perfect place to be...absolutely stunning view of the bay, beautiful comfortable home, peaceful music in every room, beautiful gardens everywhere, and wonderful Carol! Her special touches are everywhere & the best we have ever stayed in! She is so gracious and ready to help in any possible way. She encouraged us to take a Birding Cruise from Bellingham, which was a highlight of our trip, as we were able to photography Tufted Puffins! WOW!! We love nature and birds, and were so comforted by all the birds and wildlife we could see and hear from the patio.
It was hard for us to leave this lovely peaceful space. But, we know that we will be back in the future!! I can't recommend this wonderful place enough! Thank you Carol and Logan for sharing such a beautiful space!!"

Stayed a few nights","The biggest (and only) problem with this location is you will never want to leave! The Crow’s Nest was “over the top” amazing! It exceeded our expectations and the pictures don’t do it justice; it’s much better, if that’s even possible to imagine. We could have spent our entire time there at the house and been extremely happy without ever venturing out into the cute surrounding area, although we enjoyed that as well. We highly recommend Oyster Bar(Bow) and Black Cat (Fairhaven) restaurants. The eagles, sea otters, seals, blue herons and much more kept us thoroughly entertained. Carol is truly the hostess with the mostess. Her flowers and succulents everywhere (inside and out) are gorgeous and her green thumb is impressive. The pastries were delicious too! The shower and plush linens helped us feel even more pampered. Very clean and comfortable. Carol thought of everything! We hope to return on our next trip to the PNW!"

Stayed a few nights","This modern, architecturally stunning northwest home with panoramic views of Chuckanut Bay offered me a tranquil, comforting and restorative retreat. While the beautiful interior, filled with all the thoughtful touches to create a welcoming and luxurious space and a wall of windows to bring the outside into the home, I spent much of my visit on the expansive deck, taking in the bird songs and the sound of lapping water and the warmth of the Solstice sun. I took one of the host’s kayaks out for both an early evening and early morning paddle and saw curious seals and lots of shorebirds. Carol provided a lovely touch of delicious breakfast items in a well-stocked kitchen, a list of recommended restaurants in nearby Fairhaven and Bellingham, and ideas on numerous hikes within 10 minutes of the home. She was a delight to chat with and responsive to any questions. It was hard to leave such a peaceful and natural space by the water’s edge."

We savored spending mornings and evenings on the deck, soaking up the magnificent view. We took a day to drive up Mt. Baker Highway to Picture Lake with a spectacular view of Mt. Shuksan. Another day we took the ferry from Anacortes to San Juan island to explore Roche Harbor and Lime Kiln State Park. We also spent a day in the delightful Whatcom Falls and Boundary Bay parks, both of which had lovely trails. Without a doubt, Carol’s place lives up to all the praise you’ve read. Hesitate no further and book it."

The interior of the house is spacious and luxurious. Carol has thought of so many little details like cream for the coffee, delicious pastries for breakfast, and convenient bathroom amenities. The bed and linens were fantastic and the whole house sound system made it feel like we were living in a spa in the clouds. We will miss the nightly sunsets and hope to be back again sometime!"

The house itself is luxurious, yet still comfortable…you will want for nothing, and will be presented with the best view you can imagine. We had jaw dropping sunsets every single night — had to pry ourselves away from this jewel of a house. When you do finally tear yourself away…take advantage of Carol and her son’s recommendations for restaurants — they’re fantastic. Thai Maison was a happy surprise. Also don’t miss Taylor Shellfish Farm — grilled oysters are out of this world. Carol is also happy to share hiking recommendations, which we happily took advantage of, and there are kayaks at the house to explore the bay that is literally just steps away. Absolute perfection!"

Water access is down 70 stairs so not for anyone with limited mobility. The view and being right on the water made up for this for us.
Really the only downside is the train traffic; more than we realized and not a romantic train sound in the distance; rather what it is, a freight train. Thankfully, we were able to sleep through the sound after the first night. Overall, an amazing stay."

The spectacular view made for a peaceful comfortable experience even during the snow storm with 30mph winds first night. The lights flickered a few times but did not loose power. Didn't do much site seeing as were happy to stay within the comforts of Cove's Nest a absolute treasure and gem in Bellingham.

Hiking, exploring the coastline, wandering/shopping around Fairhaven/Bellingham, finding awesome eateries/breweries/coffee shops, and just relaxing in this gorgeous home are some of the highlights of our stay here. On day 2 of 5, we booked a another stay — which should be indicative of how much we loved our time at the Crow’s Nest!! The view is next level amazing, and the home itself is gorgeous, but still exuding a comfortable spa-like vibe. The kitchen is perfectly stocked — we cooked a fantastic dinner with seafood we got from Taylor Shellfish Farm (a can’t miss if you’re an oyster fan!) and we weren’t lacking for anything. Although we did get distracted more than a few times by one of the best sunsets ever, over the endless, mesmerizing bay view! There are thoughtful touches throughout — cozy blankets, delicious smelling soaps and lotions, a spacious closet and laundry area, beautiful fireplace, multiple comfortable reading nooks, interesting subject matter coffee table books, slippers, robes, beautiful plants…the list goes on and on! Oh, and the radiant heat and Sonos whole house sounds system…we enjoyed those immensely. There is nothing about this lovely home that we would change. What a dream!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is even more amazing than what you see on the listing! Truly! Having never been to Bellingham, the views are what sold us on selecting The Crow's Nest for our honeymoon. Once we arrived and experienced the whole home in person--we were just in awe and continued to be for our entire stay. The views and terraced landscaping are breathtaking, the home is open and spacious yet comfortable, the décor and special touches are thoughtful and lovely. I especially enjoyed being able to go down to the water and dip my toes in the Bay at low tide. Our host, Carol, was very gracious. We just loved our stay and it was really more amazing in person than the listing can convey. We hope to return someday and highly recommend!"

We didn’t turn the tv on the whole time for the view was enough. The space was immaculately designed, very clean, and a perfect oasis for our anniversary. It was a great distance from many shops and restaurants and the drive to reach it was breathtaking. We will be back and so will all our friends we tell about it :)"

We didn't expect to have some breakfast goodies for our first morning and it was very nice treat. The stellar view is amazing from home and patio. Comfy patio chairs were perfect for our happy hours and star glazing. Next time, I would bring my yoga mat.
The landscaping is very pretty in the Zen garden as well as near the water. Very relaxing and beautiful everywhere you look. We had great weather in early October which made our stay even better."

Stayed a few nights","The Crow’s Nest is one of the most spectacular places to stay in the PNW! The host, Carol, lives next door and is the quintessential hostess. We were greeted by Carol and given door codes and the general rundown. We had eggs, cream for coffee, butter and orange juice in the refrigerator and ice in the freezer for our use and fresh pastries on the counter! Carol gave us tips and suggestions on what we could do and they also have kayaks you can use to go and see the baby seals!!! Yes, baby seals. ❤️
The view is on another level and showcases Chuckanut Bay in all its glory. Sit on the deck overlooking the water with a drink, sit under the Madrona tree on the chairs with evening drinks…just all the drinks!! 🤣 I guess you could also read. 😂
Every now and then, you hear the train, but it is not anything that would ruin your day or anything. Just a train. 😁
There are two main living areas, just the perfect amount of room to sprawl out and get comfy. I mean, then there’s the deck!!! Have all your meals, read, take a nap, do all the things out on that beautiful deck!!
The Crows Nest is perfect for couples looking for a getaway that is beautiful and serene with the BEST hostess!! If it’s available, book it NOW!!"

Pictures were so inviting, but when we walked through the door the view was simply stunning - her home is beautifully designed and so wonderfully equipped - and all the small thoughtful touches just go to prove that Carol has found her second calling. She is a fabulous host. My husband and I kept saying - “we could live here” - so obviously Carol has created a space that feels like “home” only better! We felt spoiled! We felt relaxed. And we knew if we needed anything at all, Carol was just a quick message away. It was the perfect combination. We look forward to the day that we may return. Thank you, Carol, for providing this sanctuary for us. It was a memorable way to celebrate 19 years. Sending gratitude hugs, Gayle and John."

Stayed over a week","As one can find by looking back through the over 440 reviews for this truly uniquely beautiful home and location on the Chuckanut Bay in the Pacific North West we have been frequent visitors and guest of this amazing property and even more amazing host who clearly is the quintessential super host of Airbnb properties. I once again find myself searching for the most appropriate and fitting combination of superlatives and adjectives to describe the Crow’s Nest property, the Bellingham region of Washington and Carol, who hosts this property. As I have commented in the past, as have so many other of Carol’s guests, the Crow’s Nest is in every way a uniquely beautiful home and location on the Chuckanut Bay where the Northern Cascades virtually come down to the ocean. In fact the main highway leading to the property from the south (Highway 11) is listed among the most beautiful drives in Washington State as picked by local experts and one can experience other drives on this list within a days drive from the property.
The home is of contemporary, northwestern architecture and has been designed to take maximum advantage of the stunning views. One never tires of utilizing the full length outdoor deck and wall of floor to ceiling windows, that run the full extent of the home which views the bay, as the skies, water and sunsets offer stunning vistas that are sure to delight even the most discerning individual making it hard to leave for a day of adventure. The deck is furnished with a variety of chairs and tables well suited to most anyone’s comfort. As one can see from the posted photos the spacious home is an open architecture with vaulted ceiling. The host keeps the home meticulously clean and most welcoming. The home is fully stocked with the highest of quality of virtually everything including everything you will need to make you stay comfortable, and memorable. A modern and fully functional kitchen, extremely comfortable Ekornes furniture throughout the great room, a comfortable queen sized bed, two full baths and a laundry room all on the same level. The home includes a gas fireplace, in floor heating, a whole home Sonos sound system, attractive artwork, ceiling fans, full length sunscreen shades on all the windows and so much more. The home and location offer both a sense of peaceful privacy and the ambience of being isolated from the urban environment. Bellingham is but a few miles away and has everything and anything one will need for entertainment, excellent grocery stores, dining options including waterfront restaurants, local farm produce and opportunities for virtually any outdoor activities. Mount Baker highway into the Cascades offers some of the most spectacular views one will find in the lower 48. As Mount Baker gets the most snowfall in the winter of any other location in the world (annual average of some 63 feet, and a record of over 90 feet in a single year). A must see if you are staying long enough to spend a day trip to this area.
To make your stay even more special and as I have noted in the past, Carol’s hospitality is truly extraordinary. She is gracious, warm and a welcoming host and in my opinion is the gold standard for all others to attempt to equal. Her combination of design and accessorizing skills coupled with her attention to every detail including small touches make the home truly beautiful to enjoy with every room having just the right furnishings, accessories, plants and amenities. She evidences a focus and passion for making your visit her priority while never interfering with your activities she is always available for any and all of your questions or needs. As Carol has spent her entire life in this area she is a tremendous resource for suggestions on virtually and all of your interests with outstanding suggestions and personal experiences to make your time here even that much more memorable.
For anyone with the opportunity to stay in this fabulous home, it will amaze and delight!
While thank you Carol cannot come close to expressing our appreciation for you sharing this exquisite home, remarkably gorgeous location, your most gracious support of every need, your generosity and your countless little extra touches; thank you once again Carol for yet another amazing, most memorable and enjoyable experience."

The home itself belongs in Architectural Digest, as does the entire compound down to the shoreline. Our host, Carol, was wonderful, and the kitchen and bathrooms are fitted out with everything you could imagine in a luxury resort. The small town of Fairhaven is nearby for supplies, with shops and dining, and during the summer the ferry terminal has excursions throughout the San Juan islands. If it is not booked up in advance, don’t pass it up."

Stayed a few nights","The most incredible airbnb bar none. We have stayed at airbnbs all around the globe and this was by far our favorite. Carol has thought of every detail: a fully stocked kitchen, spa-like bath items, luxury linens and the list goes on and on. She greeted us apon our arrival, went over the workings of the house (TV, SONOS sound system), provided great local recommendations for dining, sightseeing and hiking and left us with some goodies for the morning (eggs, cream, butter and delicious pastries). BUT nothing will prepare you for the house and its location...the pictures truly do not do it justice. The home itself is gorgeous with its clean, modern, but also warm norwegian influences - and then you see the view...be still my heart... it is stunning!!! I must have 45 pictures from the deck from sunny mornings, rainy afternoons to breathtaking sunsets. 5 stars just isnt enough for this one. Only cons we could come up with are the train (not a big deal at all) and no blinds in the bedroom (moon can be bright at night if you are a light sleeper and like the dark). But trust me in that you will not be disappointed with this rental! Thx again Carol for a truly amazing stay in your home..."

Second impression, delight--the Crow's Nest is beautifully designed with luxe comfort in mind. Every detail is worked through, and every need considered. The radiant heat in the floors is a comforting touch as are the built in sound system, the spa robes and slippers, and the throws in little niches. I loved the lighting throughout and all of the sky lights. It's hard to pick a favorite element, maybe the live orchids, athuriums, and succulents in perfect places. Carol is an excellent host and provides information that you need while in the home as well as recommendations. She mentioned the Tulip Festival, and we went--loved it! We'll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","If you have found this review, then you have already found the best place that Airbnb has to offer. To begin with, Carol is the perfect hostess for the property. The communication was timely and initial walk through was complete enough to understand the house and how everything works, and we were then left to enjoy it. That was not hard to do.
The view of the water could make you think you were in the only house on the bay. The neighborhood is quiet, ( apart from the contributions from Burlington Northern - though that was fine by us ). If you are adept at cooking it's a cook's kitchen. Stocked well beyond expectation for utensils and cooktops, oil, balsamic vinegar and spices. We normally bring a Henckels along, but there is no need, it's all there. If you don't cook, the restaurant recommendations are all completely right. Carol has clearly thought through what her guests could need to be comfortable during their stay."

Between the radiant heating (warm floors), slippers, soft throws, fireplace, and double-headed shower, it had the feeling of a spa retreat. There were so many enjoyable and luxe details to delight in, including the thoughtful pastries Carol set out for us and some lovely provisions in the fridge. Music is our thing, so we loved the Sonos sound system throughout. This place is a gem and we look forward to future stays!"

Stayed a few nights","This treehouse is truly remarkable. I can safely say I’ve never been in an Airbnb quite like this! Natasha and Brandon have done an incredible job putting so many finishing touches and details into the treehouse, and their attention to detail truly shows. The place was absolutely spotless, too. Such a cool experience!!
There were a couple of minor things - as others have said, the bed is not very comfortable, even with a mattress topper. It’s quite squeaky, so if anyone rolls over, it may wake light sleepers. We spoke with the hosts about the noise from the heaters, and about needing to replace the pans in the kitchen - I would say, don’t plan on cooking any large meals, as the kitchen is very efficient.
The road noise is noticeable on the deck, and if you open any of the windows. It detracts a bit from the peaceful setting, but the views are excellent and the treehouse is still gorgeous.
Overall, a really lovely stay!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and her parents had a very special getaway at the treehouse. They shared that the location is magical, tucked among the trees and overhanging the waterfall, and the treehouse itself was light-filled and equipped with so many thoughtful touches that made it feel both cozy and luxurious. Natasha was responsive to questions when they came up. We will recommend this special spot!"

Stayed a few nights","Natasha and Brandon's tree house was clean, well stocked, and private. It's a small space but they made so much out of the space with tables, counters, etc. that can extend as needed but also be compact as needed. Communication was excellent - prompt, friendly, welcoming. You can hear some of the highway traffic but it is exactly as described - you hear it outside but with windows and doors closed, it's silent. The one thing that would have made our stay more comfortable would have been a more comfortable pull-out couch with a thicker mattress but the extra foam padding they provide made it better. Love the large projector and all the movies made available to guests!"

Stayed a few nights","I have nothing but great things to say about this stay and the hosts! The treehouse was immaculately clean, they added sweet touches like fresh flowers, they left us a basket of locally made treats, they had a whole book of information and instructions about the treehouse and nearby town. You truly feel like you’re in a fairytale while staying there, the waterfall is magical, and being literally in the trees was so beautiful. The kitchen and bathroom are great for the space and the projector screen makes for great cozy evenings if you’re not enjoying the deck with fire pit or hot tub. I had questions before booking about accessibility and Natasha was so kind and helpful with everything. The only thing we were sad about was not getting to meet their cat ‘Dude’ that comes around. It was truly one of the best trips my mom and I have ever taken. We have recommended it to all our friends and family and will absolutely be coming back to enjoy this incredible place!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Natasha and Brandon's treehouse was like stepping into a fairy tale, truly every inner child’s dream come true! From the minute we rolled up, they greeted us and offered EV parking, making us feel right at home, they really went above and beyond to make sure we had the best time and felt at ease.
The treehouse itself, tucked away in the forest, was the ultimate getaway spot away from all the city noise. The views, sounds of the waterfall, and birds singing were like something straight out of a movie. It had that perfect mix of adventure vibes and modern comfort.
One of the highlights of our trip was the fantastic recommendations provided. Natasha had an extensive knowledge of the local area and offered personalized recommendations for places to explore. From the stunning views and beautiful accommodations to the incredible hospitality and thoughtful recommendations, every aspect of our experience was nothing short of perfect. We cannot recommend this property enough!"

It felt very private and the view was unbelievably gorgeous. The hot tub is a great addition and we had a relaxing time soaking and taking in the freshness of the forest. We will be coming back for another special occasion and have already recommended this place to all of our friends.

Stayed one night","Our stay at the Bellingham Treehouse, hosted by Natasha and Brandon, was magical. Despite cold weather, the cozy and luxurious treehouse made up for it, offering stunning 360 views and serenity from our treetop retreat. We couldn't use the hot tub due to a chlorine allergy. However, we enjoyed the home theater and the many thoughtful touches like a delightful tea selection and local snacks. The interior's warmth, elegant design, and natural setting provided a unique and comfortable experience. Natasha and Brandon's commitment to guest comfort made our brief stay memorable. The Bellingham Treehouse is ideal for a peaceful and luxurious escape into nature. Thanks to our hosts for such an inspiring and tranquil stay."

Stayed a few nights","A beautiful treehouse and location, you can tell Natasha and Brandon care about this place and their guests. However, we had two issues others should be aware of. While there is a 4k projector, the internet service is not good enough for it to be useful. We were unable to stream at a quality above 240p because of the poor internet. The pullout bed is also very uncomfortable and needs replaced. I'm sure it was great when new, but we actually left before the end of our visit because we didn't went to spend another night on that bed and without being able to use the projector. Our plan to watch the Superbowl here didn't work out as we hoped.
Otherwise we really loved the space and location, but the price point makes those two issues tough to swallow. This spot is a 5/5 at a lower price, but unfortunately we didn't have the experience the listed amenities and price would suggest. But if your priorities are otherwise, the location and treehouse experience are great."

The extra touches like the color changing and dimmable interior and exterior lights, as well as the projector screen and hot tub make the experience that much better. Unfortunately, between the mattress being as stiff as a board and as squeaky as an old door hinge, coupled with unsupportive pillows, we barely got any sleep. We would definitely would stay here again - we’ll just be bringing an air mattress next time 😊"

Booked the place hoping to spend evenings on the terrace enjoying the solitude of the place, however on the terrace highway noise can’t be ignored. In the evening it was even worse since you were able to see car lights from the highway. Overall, amazing place, just make sure you have the right expectations. If you want to spend time in bed watching the TV, the place is perfect (no highway noise inside the house)."

Stayed one night","The treehouse is such a unique experience, offering a rare escape from the ordinary. We loved the hot tub and the beautiful view. It’s 10-15 minutes drive to downtown Bellingham.
The host did a great job of managing expectations around white noise from the highway (which some may find soothing, but given it is cold outside now and the windows were shut was a non-issue) and creaking from the trees (which we did not hear at all).
The only thing that kept me from giving this experience five stars is the couch bed."

Stayed a few nights","This place is incredible. What a unique experience. The setting is gorgeous with the waterfall and forest. It rained much of the time but it didn’t detract from the experience. We even sat on the deck and had a fire in the gas fire pit table and enjoyed eating dinner out there while it rained. The pictures don’t do it justice. It’s a little scary how the treehouse is situated but it was crafted extremely well and so I felt very safe. We had a great time and although we went out and explored the surrounding Bellingham area as well, we really didn’t want to leave the treehouse. The hottub was in great condition. If you’re going to stay here, keep in mind that it’s a treehouse and small compared to a house, but it was still very nice and comfortable for two people. I highly recommend staying here for a romantic weekend getaway."

The only thing to note is that if it is a bit windy, you definitely hear knocking on the treehouse. The first night was windier than the first and it did keep me up. I was able to turn on the fan to block it out a bit. By the second night either I didn’t notice it as much or I was used to it at that point. But I am also a light sleeper so that could’ve been it too.
Other than that the treehouse was absolute perfection, and we plan to return for another visit sometime!"

Stayed one night","This place was beautiful 😍. Very peaceful and serene. I would sit out on the porch all day, if I could, and listen to the water trickling down the rocks. You do hear the giant Douglas fir trees lightly ""thumping"" that are attached to the treehouse but I thought this was neat as you don't realize that trees do make sounds. This was a cute and quaint little place. Perfect for 1 or 2 people. I would suggest taking a smaller bag that you can carry over your shoulder with all of your belongings as there is a short wood chip path that you have to walk down to. Doesn't work well with luggage on wheels ☺️. Overall, this place was definitely worth it and such a neat experience. It had everything we needed and Natasha was a great host. She recommended several places to eat. We ate at the Black Cat for dinner (great choice) and also the Birch Door Cafe for breakfast (even better). She was available if we needed anything, otherwise, we just enjoyed the peace and quiet. Would highly recommend."

If you plan to go into town, I suggest loading up your navigation while connected to Wi-Fi at the treehouse. Cell reception was spotty until you get well out to the main road. The pullout bed was a nice quality one but keep in mind it is still a pullout. Even with the mattress topper, we found it a bit hard. If the weather is nice, I suggest keeping the window cracked at night and you can fall asleep to the sounds of the waterfall. Overall we would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","A dendrophile's paradise. I can't say enough about how impeccably aesthetic this luxury treehouse is, and how the place and its surroundings make it incredibly easy to relax.
First, the drive leading up to the treehouse is very enjoyable. Shortly after you turn onto the main drive, you'll be able to see the treehouse nestled high above on your right, and you will know you are in for a big treat.
The instructions to find the place were extremely accurate and easy to follow which made check in as stress-free as possible.
The view is stunning, the bed and linens are as comfy as a cloud, the surround-sound is a dream, the tasteful decorations are delightful, and the thoughtful touches (like local breakfast cookies and granola) make this one a cut above the rest.
P.S. Try the nearby logging trail for a quiet and enchanting walk through the forest."

The residence was not only accurate to the photos but was somehow even better in person ! From the second I drove onto the property to the moment I left I was in absolute aw of my surroundings and very impressed with their attention to detail ! The amount of love and attention they put into this home was so amazing and hard to miss, with fresh flowers, complimentary drinks and high end appliances - I did not walk away with a single complaint ! 10/10 highly recommend this unique experience !!!"

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this fun little treehouse. One thing I will plan for next time is to take the host up on the offer of the mattress topper as the bed is a little too firm for our taste but that’s on us as it was offered. Really fun place to relax and the waterfall is magnificent!!"

Stayed one night","My husband found this treehouse as a birthday weekend getaway for me. It was perfect! Natasha accommodated an early check-in for us as we drove up from Seattle and wanted to maximize our time in the treehouse while there was still daylight. The waterfall is literally right next to/below the treehouse and it's so peaceful to listen to. It's a cozy space but did not feel cramped-- the sofa bed was a bit firm but fine for one night. The hot tub was an amazing perk -- and there are bathrobes and sandals for guests to use! They really thought of everything. The 4K projector with Netflix/AppleTV/etc was perfect to watch a movie at the end of our night.
Highly recommend for a relaxing and romantic getaway!
It's about 15 min driving to downtown Bellingham and we enjoyed a great dinner at Carnal."

The complete Sonos system and 4K projector gave my fiancé and I the perfect movie night and the Hue lighting set the mood. The huge picture windows allowed us to focus on nature and gaze out across the snowy landscape and the hot tub warmed up in all the right ways. A few things to note - if it snows, the driveway is STEEP. Natasha and Brandon mentioned this when you book, but it’s worth mentioning again. Natasha was incredibly kind and very responsive when we needed her. We would stay here again, 100%!!"

Just over a 45 minute drive away from Canada, the treehouse offers everything one could ask for a romantic weekend or a family trip to see some of the most stunning views and hikes that Washington has to offer. The host was always available if we had any questions or needed recommendations. Prepare for a drive up a rugged road before a quiet, 5-star stay. You will not regret staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","What an outstanding place to visit and stay! There are really no words to fully interpret the experience. The tree house is sitting above a scenic valley, surrounded by luscious Washington forest. The waterfall right beside the tree house is rushing down, what seems to be, a couple of hundred yards drop - absolutely stunning. The scenery is simply impeccable! The house itself is very sound, built and decorated with a good taste and piece of mind. It has a 180° view of panoramic windows, plus smaller windows on pretty much every wall that allows you to enjoy the gorgeous nature surrounding you. It is a studio setup, so your living room is your bedroom as well (pull out sofa is really comfortable). Waking up to those captivating views was simply priceless. We would definitely recommend for romantic couple getaway. Hosts are very attentive, helpful, and happily available with any questions. Honestly, if we could, we would give it a 10☆ out of 5! We are planning to revisit this house again in the future."

Outside of that it was a bit smaller especially the shower so if your a big person then you won’t have much room to move around. The views were great and I would go back again when it’s not raining.

Stayed a few nights","The treehouse manages to balance a small space and luxury/comfort in a clever way. Everything felt very intentional and the perfect amount of space for me. Beautiful details like exposed wood and tile kitchen backsplash are a treat the eye, but the deck of the treehouse and waterfall steal the show. A cold February night stayed cozy with the help of waterfall noises, fire tables, and a high quality projector. Natasha was very communicative and accommodating during my stay. I only wish it could have been a little longer."

What a beautiful little home - so cozy and well equipped with everything we hoped for to make our stay perfect. Although it was a little too chilly most days, we did get to enjoy a munch and some wine on the deck above the waterfall - thanks to the propane fire! We would love to return when we could spend more time on that lovely outside area. Thanks to Natasha and Brandon for the welcome treats, spotless accommodations, speedy communication and helpful recommendations for area restaurants. What a memorable way to celebrate my husbands birthday. He won’t forget this one."

Stayed a few nights","Our most recent stay at Annie's place was during an ""Arctic Blast"" that hit Bellingham during mid-January. The daytime temps were around 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and the nighttime temps were in the single digits. One night in particular, powerful gusts drove the wind chill down to subzero levels. In short, it was VERY cold outside.
We were perfectly warm and comfortable inside Annie's ""Raven's City Roost"" throughout this period of extreme cold. The unit is very well insulated, and the heater gives off plenty of warmth. Don't hesitate to book a stay there regardless of the season; you will always be comfortable.
The unit is located off of what must be the quietest alley on planet earth. If cleanliness, peacefulness, and comfort are what you value most in an Airbnb rental, look no further--this is the place for you. And Annie is a friendly and wonderful host."

There were so many amazing and considerate accommodations in the bathroom, kitchen, and living room- most of which were clearly labeled which was very convenient. We had a great time cooking here and watching movies. We also loved being greeted by the neighborhood cat Yoru! Very convenient location to downtown city center. Will definitely reccomend this to any family or friends who come to Bellingham."

It was even more lovely than the photos. The apartment is so beautifully decorated and so well appointed -Annie has thought of everything and more!

It was also the absolute coziest landing pad at the end of the night, loaded with all the creature comforts we could possibly need. The very best part was the wildly comfortable bed with the softest sheets. We didn’t have a car with us and the bus to downtown station was right across the street, which made getting around super easy when we weren’t walking (which is totally possible, especially in warmer weather). Highly recommend, especially for a couple – it really feels like your own little nest up above the neighborhood."

Stayed about a week","I had a terrific 7-night stay at Annie's studio apartment, nicknamed ""Raven's City Roost"". The apartment served as a base from which I explored multiple Bellingham neighborhoods and nearby communities for future planned relocation to the area. The apartment is located on the edge of the Columbia and Lettered Streets neighborhoods, and downtown Bellingham is a short walk away--about 20 minutes for a brisk walker. The apartment is spotlessly clean, private, cozy and peaceful. The bed is comfortable, and I slept very well each night during my stay. I walked between 6 to 10 miles a day, night and day, all over Bellingham and never felt unsafe. The small kitchen and downstairs laundry room are great conveniences. One of the best parts of my trip, however, was meeting Annie in person for an enjoyable chat. She's a fantastic hostess, and cares a great deal about her guests' comfort and satisfaction. It's hard to imagine anyone not enjoying their stay at Raven's City Roost. My rating is A+."

Stayed one night","This studio has everything you could possibly need. We loved staying there and all the little touches really add up. In addition to great communication and a well designed space, they have even gone the extra mile to provide a fully stocked kitchen, bathroom essentials if you forgot something at home, and even some games and books for you to enjoy during your stay. In the current era of corporate bare bones Airbnb’s this is a true gem and I would highly recommend."

Such a cute little place with lots of charm! Love the artwork and plants all over the studio! So clean and comfy!
Can’t say enough positive things about our stay. She has everything labeled and leaves a nice snack basket and extra things if you forgot something (toothbrush, floss, lotion)! Annie has cute little touches around the place (guestbook, postcards for mailing, etc). Just overall a fantastic stay and great little place! Oh and did I mention that the sheets on the bed are unbelievably soft!
Thank you Annie for the amazing stay!"

The studio apartment was equally as great! We had plenty of room for our family of 3 and we loved all of the ""homey"" touches. It was equipped with everything we could need (and some). If we find ourselves in Bellingham again I guarantee we will try to stay here!"

The only downside is that it’s not very plus size/disability friendly. Stairs, standard size towels, and small stools. These are all things shown in the photos, however, and our stay was relaxing regardless. We will be back!"

It was cozy, but not cluttered. Annie was great at communicating, and paid attention to all of the little details that differentiate between a good trip and a great trip. The location was great - a nice jumping-off point for lots of hiking and biking. It was nice to have a place to easily store my bike - sometimes that can be hard to find."

Stayed one night","Annie has thought if just about every possible need a traveler may have with this unit. Forget a toiletry? There’s stash to use. Want to stay in and cook? The kitchen is well stocked and ready for whatever you want to make. Good selection of teas and I saw at least two bags of coffee as well. There’s even an in case of emergency stash of chocolate when you need a fix. :)
All of these amazing, thoughtful touches come in a very well organized and comfortable space. One of my favorite things though is the several indoor plants throughout the unit. I love indoor plants (real ones) and you don’t always see a nice touch like that in an AirBNB rental. I will definitely try to stay here again my next time in B-ham!"

Stayed one night","This place feels like home. When you open the medicine cabinet or look on the kitchen shelves, it truly feels like home. Every little thing you could imagine needing in your own home is provided here… q tips, makeup remover, Advil, nail file, etc. Annie’s above and beyond accommodation brings a great value to this place above a hotel or what other listings provide at a very basic level. The bed was also amazing and the place was SPOTLESSLY clean. Brand new bathroom with large and luxurious shower. We also loved the abundance of real plants throughout the space. 10 min walk to downtown, coffee and a market just around the corner if needed. Will def stay again next year for our annual Bellingham Memorial Day trip."
