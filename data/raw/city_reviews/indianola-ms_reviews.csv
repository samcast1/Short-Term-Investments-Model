Stayed with kids",We were in town for my brothers wedding and needed a family friendly spot not far from the venue. We grew up a few blocks away and it really felt at home. Initially I was skeptical due to the location but there were no issues!! Annette was very helpful when communicating about any questions I had and any issues that arose during our stay. We would definitely patronize this location again as it was everything the description and pics said it would be. We appreciate the hospitality.

Stayed a few nights",It is rare that you get to park inside a garage on an Airbnb but this place had a garage! The house was the right size for us and was comfortable and clean. The neighborhood was quiet and it was close to the race we were running in. I was uncertain about the water from the tap and would definitely buy bottled water were I to return.

As usual, my stay was great with exceptional service. Not only is the home beautifully decorated, you really invest in the guest experience by making sure that you have the latest appliances and fixtures so that no one feels as though they are staying in a dated property. Thank you again, and I look forward to my next stay in Greenville!

Group trip","When we first arrived to property Annette was very prompt with exact details for opening the lockbox because we were having issues. However I was uncomfortable because there was no remote for the garage which meant I had to leave the garage door open when I left the property. The property was somewhat clean but cleanliness need to go a bit further with cleaning wall stains, baseboards and pots and pans were not properly clean. The dust pan used for cleaning was filled with hair and dirt. I had elderly relatives with me and the noisy cars driving by was almost unbearable for them. The appliances, dishes and washer and dryer were clean. I also appreciate that there was supplies available to do laundry. Lastly the sound of the heating unit was loud and startled when it came on late and night."

The only problem was something completely out of her control-the street noise. I had trouble falling asleep, as it was very loud until midnight. Everything else was very great. She even let us check out late so we could shower after our race. Thanks!"

Unfortunately, another guest accidentally took the garage opener so there was a slight inconvenience there, but not a real complaint. The closed in garage was one of thee best features!! The house was fully furnished (every single room), nicely decorated and clean! It smelled amazing & the air was already on for us. Annette was super responsive and even allowed us to stay an extra day on a whim! I really appreciate that. She's most def my top choice while visiting Greenville!"

Furthermore, the house presents as a cheap flip. In every room the floors slope away from the center of the house and the shower tile appears as if a new home owner used Tic Tok as a guide."

Stayed a few nights","This tranquil little gem is nestled just off Deer Creek at the cusp of Leland, MS -- walking distance to the boy-hood home of Jim Henson (now a dedicated Museum). We arrived during a festive holiday season for Leland with Deer Creek adorned in decoration awaiting their famed Kermit/Santa Christmas float, so needless to say, we were enamored.
Only briefly in town for business, the well-kept abode with a plethora of adorable decorations, was a perfect retreat !! We each had our own themed room and made extensive use of the well-stocked kitchen and pantry !! We will definitely re-book on our next adventure to Leland !!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful stay at Carol's pink cottage. It is very spacious! I was in town for the Highway 61 Blues Festival and I couldn't believe how close I was to downtown Leland. As a visual person, I appreciated the pictures that Carol sent to me for check-in instructions, etc. I loved having the eggs, bread, coffee, snacks and water bottles! I slept really good in the front bedroom as the sounds from the highway didn't bother me. There's a nice room, with a firm mattress in the back of the cottage for a quieter rest. The water pressure in the shower was nice too. I also enjoyed being so close to where Kermit lived (the Jim Henson exhibit) with the cotton patch garden and the creek. Checkout instructions were the easiest I have stayed at. I highly recommend Carol's place and would love to stay here again."

We didn’t arrive until late in the night and she had went to the house and turned on some lights so we wouldn’t have to walk in an unfamiliar house in the dark. Before we got there some bad thunderstorms had came up and the temperature had dropped some and she messaged us and let us know exactly what was going on. We would recommend her lovely home to anyone wanting to spend time in that area.

Every element inside and out – from the furniture and decor to the snacks and manicured garden (Yard of the Week during my stay, and totally deserved) – is curated with the utmost care. I loved my whirlwind trip and only wish I’d stayed longer. As Gonzo sings in The Muppet Movie, I’m going to go back there someday (if you stay at Carol’s place, be sure to visit the Kermit the Frog museum just across Deer Creek). Thank you for looking after me, Carol! Until next time. x"

Stayed a few nights","The guest experience was phenomenal. Mrs. Carol and her husband really goes the extra mile to make you feel at home during your stay. The home was clean, spacious, well lit, peaceful and quiet, and in a safe area located close to downtown.
The level of the service provided by the hosts was amazing and far exceeded any expectations. Mrs. Carol was thoughtful in having snacks readily available upon check-in, leaving the lights on for my evening arrival, and preparing a handwritten note. I just truly loved the gracious hospitality offered in the Mississippi Delta.
In addition to providing a surprising welcome, Mrs. Carol is the epitome of communication and responsiveness. Before I arrived, I asked about a walking trail so that I could continue my daily workout routine. Mrs. Carol not only messaged directions but also images of landmarks so that I could become familiar with the path in a strange city/town. I followed those directions and was able to complete my 4 miles each day and I’m truly thankful for that. Note: There were no dogs or loose dogs around, so that made everything so much better in unfamiliar territory.
Overall this stay was great, the service was great, and the overall guest experience was phenomena as mentioned in my opening paragraph. The host are indeed Superhosts and should forever more be rated beyond five stars. I will definitely consider this property for all future stays.

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I were looking for a one night stay to get off the road on the way to Arkansas. This place was the perfect place to rest our head for the night. Description says rustic, but I would also consider it more cozy. We had coffee on the balcony watching the sunrise. Lynde had some great recommendations for restaurants as well. We ended up at Betties Place because we had our dogs, but some of the best home-cooked food I've ever had on the road. Would absolutely stay here again!"

Perfect for a weekend stay for a couple or couple plus 1 child. Farm living at it's best. Place was clean and exactly as described. Wifi spotty but we knew going in that it would be, lots of bugs around porch light but you're on a farm. My hubbs and I will definitely stay again and bring our 3 year old. She loves animals! Lynde was quick to respond to any and every question or concern I had. Great host and we can't wait to return."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Barn Apartment was simply serene. There was a chill in the air, with a bright blue sky and beaming sun, the sounds of birds singing and flowing water constant amidst the gorgeous landscape. It's a very peaceful spot, with scatterings of farm animals throughout their and their neighbors property. Speaking on the neighbors, they're far enough away that you feel private but not so far that you feel completely cut off from the world. Lynde was very responsive, there was a problem with the convection oven that was ultimately unresolved, but it did not diminish our stay and her husband was kind enough to take a look while we were there. Overall a quiet, relaxing, and refreshing spot, ideal for relaxing after work or a long week with a single guest. We will probably be coming back."

Stayed with kids","We rented this Beautiful property when we traveled to the Delta for a funeral. This house was absolutely perfect for my family. It was spacious, well equipped, and immaculately clean. The size and set up allowed us to be together, but also to have personal space. There was plenty of space for parking and lots of outdoor seating as well. The home was stocked with extras that are not always available in an Airbnb-toiletries, extra paper products. Perhaps the most amazing part of this stay was the kindness, communication, and understanding of the host. Even when I messaged late one night, she responded promptly and answered my question. This was not a vacation for us, but this home and host made a trying time a little easier for my family and we are grateful for that."

My family and I traveled down from Chicago as a large group to attend a funeral just North in Clarksdale. The home turned out to be the perfect fit for us all! Even I was taken by surprise upon entry! BEAUTIFUL home! Great location within town, extremely spacious & clean and it has all the amenities any number of people could need. It was truly a home away from home, just be respectful of the household and their rules and you will love your stay here! I'd like to give a moment of appreciation to Tashandra, the host, who was so so very attentive, kind and gracious from the moment I first contacted her regarding our interest in staying until the time that we made our way back home. I can't thank her enough for her superb hospitality especially during a time when we needed it the most. Her character alone made it all worth it! My family and I are definitely looking forward to staying here again! ❤"

Group trip","Our stay in the home was amazing.!
The house is well decorated and served us well as a place that offered great sleeping accommodations and a place of comfort and fellowship for many family members after formal activities of our family reunion. Although we did not exercise pool privileges the pool area is beautiful and served as private get away area for small groups of the family who had not seen each other in years to reconnect. Some of us used the area as a quiet area to reflect and meditate.
The layout of the house. is smart and included several private spaces that allowed multiple couples to experience their own private quarters while creating large beautiful space for family fellowship. The master bedroom is huge and fit for any king and/or queen.
The workout room offers equipment for anyone who wills to work off the calories from all the tasty southern food.
My family found the house to be well organized and beautiful, yet comfortable and a great value."

Stayed a few nights","The word bucolic came to mind when I drove up to the Peacock Cottage.
For me this was like stepping back in time. I grew up in the Mississippi Delta not so many miles from Peacock in the Delta. The Delta has changed so much from my 1960s childhood, so much of the land has been cleared of trees to make room for crops, so much of the crop land leveled to facilitate irrigation, YET this farm has been kept pristine, as I said, for me, literally like walking back in time.
The host, Lars, a quintessential Delta character, was a perfect host.
Oh yea, I was traveling solo, without my dogs, and Lars even arranged for the family Bernedoodle to greet me at my door each morning. Then there are also horses, pigs etc. which may come up to the back fence, just beyond the cottage, to speak.
The stay was more than a stay, it was an experience."

The cottage is cute and comfy. The porches allowed for coffee and breakfast in the mornings and every morning the puppers, Levi and River came to saw hi. There are beautiful horses and sheep and a huge piggy Lucky. Archie took us horseback riding through the farm and even showed us his carriage horses.

We BBQ’d both nights and would have used the fire pit had it been a little cooler. As to be expected in the Delta, bug spray is advisable. We loved the dogs Levi and River - they became constant companions.
We really enjoyed chatting to Lars who showed us around the farm and was really interesting to speak to. The cabin is in an ideal location for exploring the many Blues attractions in the surrounding area, and of course the Kermit Museum in Leland. Highly recommend."

The setting is maybe the most relaxing place you'll ever visit and the location is smack in the middle of the Mississippi Blues scene. The cottage is elegant with a lean toward history. It is clean, we'll kept, well appointed, and romantic. A big plus is all the animals on the farm (especially Levi the dog). Without a doubt, this is the best AirBnb we've ever experienced."

I did a little walking with Lars' dogs around the property, but it was a warm weekend, so I mostly just hung out on the screened porch or in the hammock. I was visiting by myself this time and felt totally safe. It's the perfect place for a getaway either with a friend or partner or on your own!

Every aspect of this stay was 5 stars from Lars communication, hospitality, and the charm of the cottage and property. The small touches such as providing coffee, sugar, and cream was great. Lars even allowed for my entire family to go horse back riding which was the most amazing experience. My 4 year old has not stopped talking about this trip yet and fell in love with Lars dog Rider. We will be back later this year and would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone. Lars, Kay, and Louisa treated us like family. This is absolutely a hidden gem!!! 5/5 stars (would give more if we could)."

Stayed a few nights","Incredibly charming cottage! This is JUST what we needed for a peaceful kids free girls weekend!! There are no pictures that can do this farm justice. No road noise, just nature at its finest. The cottage did tend to stay a little on the warm side bc of all the windows but all those windows also provided stunning views!
We were fortunate enough to have a small rain shower right at lunch & we loved picnicking on the screened in porch. It was perfect!
Every morning we enjoyed coffee & Bible study time on the porch and then walked right out the door to the pool. It was fabulous!
Levi, (the bernadoodle) was super friendly
and was the perfect tour companion as we walked around the property.
Lars was gracious and available but not overbearing. The cottage was closer to their home than I had realized but we still had plenty of privacy.
We brought most of our own groceries but did enjoy a delicious meal at NOLA and at lost pizza.
If you want to sleep in you might want to bring a sleep mask because the cottage does have lots of natural light ☺️
We look forward to returning in cooler temps to take advantage of the fire pit! Our time went too quickly and we look forward to coming again."

We've stayed in many, many Airbnb's, nearly all of them good to great, and this one is our family favorite. The cottage is even more beautiful in person, and those beds, whoa, we slept like babies. The land is just gorgeous. What really makes this place, though, much as with any place, is the people: our hosts were so gracious and welcoming that we just immediately felt at ease. There's much to do onsite and it's a great base for exploring the delta, but the best thing is to just sit on one of the two porches and do nothing at all :) (really). Highly recommend.
Ps: Great shower. Kitchen has everything you'd need. Yard with fire pit is another bonus."

Stayed a few nights","This spot is magical! The cabin may be small, but I can't think of a thing that would improve it. My husband and I enjoyed a short getaway, but I could also imagine coming here for a solo retreat or even a cozy stay with the kids. (Though they're about to list a new, larger cabin on the same property, so we'd probably stay there if they came.) The weather in mid-November was unseasonably warm, so we got to play games on the screened porch and read on the front porch that overlooks the horse pasture. We took long walks around the property and saw deer and an owl. Even Lars' and Cay's dogs were hospitable, welcoming us as soon as we pulled up and accompanying us on our walks.
You could certainly stay on the property your whole visit without getting bored. There's tennis, basketball, horseback riding, and even a lovely pool in season. But we took a drive to Cleveland one night and ate dinner on the patio at Hey Joe's (which felt safe because of the open air, even during Covid) and then took a long stroll through the impressive downtown Christmas light display. The next day, we drove over to Greenville for a catfish sandwich at Gino's (thanks to the recommendation of a previous reviewer!), a peaceful walk through the Greenville Cypress Preserve, a drive to Warfield Point Park to see the Mississippi River, and finally a stop by Winterville Mounds to see some of the largest remaining mounds constructed by indigenous people a thousand years ago.
All in all, it was a fantastic getaway and I'm trying to figure out how soon I can get back!"

If you want to get away and unwind this is the spot. Read a book, play a game, nap or whatever you enjoy! We plan to return. The cottage is plenty spacious.

While Lars and family are nearby, the space feels entirely yours, but Lars is quick to respond to messages if needed. We spent mornings on the back porch enjoying the early sun and evenings having dinner on the screened front porch, and of course enjoyed the pool and tennis courts. Be sure to ask for Archie’s number for horseback riding around the property, he’s got a wealth of knowledge and plenty of good jokes to share. Nearby are several good restaurants and bars (with safe distancing during pandemic), including Hey Joe’s in Cleveland which seems to have the most affordable craft beer in the world and Gino’s, a drive through with one of the best catfish sandwich I’ve ever had.

My gut feeling is saying that this experience in the Tennessee Delta will bring me something unforeseen to my future life. I will return here someday. Let's keep diving ""into the unknown"" until then!"

My husband and I enjoyed ourselves the first night just unhooking from the world. The second night our kids joined us and we had an afternoon of swimming. We ended the night with beautiful thunderstorms across the Delta, which are some of God’s greatest masterpieces. We sat on the screened in porch listening to the rain and went to bed to the sights and sound of the thunderstorm thru the wallnof windows inside the cabin. Perfect weekend get away.

Note to out-of-towners/folks unfamiliar with the Mississippi Delta region: there are LOTS of LARGE BUGS, especially at dusk. We stayed in the beginning of June, so other times of the year it isn’t usually as “busy”, but don’t be surprised by lots of insects! That being said, Lars had some bug spray and a porch that was screened in which definitely helps."

I did stay in the cold winter/rainy month but I stayed warm with the nice linens and the heater in the bathroom helped a lot . The horses and wildlife are beautiful and super cool to watch and appreciate. I didn’t ride because of busy work schedule but I will certainly come back to take them up on it! Archie was super nice and helpful as well. Kitchenette is small but efficient and while I don’t read much the selection made me want to. There wasn’t any storage for clothes like dressers or closets but I found the hooks on the bathroom door and the front hanger hook very helpful. Luggage racks came in handy too! All in all I recommend anyone to come stay I was happy and very pleased with my stay!

The cottage is so peaceful with only the sound of wildlife all around. It’s beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking at all of the books on the bookshelves. The photos do not do this place justice!
Lars is such a great host and very kindly took us on a tour of the farm in the morning. We feel very lucky to have spent some time here and will be recommending it to friends if and when they pass through. One of our best air bnb experiences for sure.
Thank you so much Lars, we really hope we can come back one day.

Stayed a few nights","Lars' place is just as perfect as you would expect. My partner and I were looking for a quiet weekend away from the city and we found just that. Lars met us as we pulled up the driveway, was friendly and respectful from the start. The cabin is perfect for a few days away; it has a small kitchen with range, sink, mini-fridge, microwave, and a few pots/pans/utensils. The bathroom had clean towels and a new bar of soap, bath/shower, and a few board games in the closet. The linens were clean and the cabin itself was fresh and tidy. We watched the sun rise from the SW facing porch, strolled around Lars' cotton fields, swam in the pool, and enjoyed the night from the screened in porch. The cabin is full of windows so you feel outside even when the mosquitoes push you in. We saw thousands of stars and the Milky Way, and even on hot days, the nights were cool and breezy. If you're looking for a safe, quiet place to hide out in the Mississippi Delta, I couldn't recommend Lars' cottage more."

I’m so sad I didn’t get to see the property during the day light— from what I could see it felt like a magical lush forest accompanied by the summer songs of crickets. So peaceful! The cottage itself was clean, cozy and the books were incredible selections. Like another reviewer said on here, I would definitely come back to spend some quality solo time to write.
Thanks again Lars for your hospitality and flexibility with my travel plans! Can’t wait to come back for the full experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Once we arrived, we viewed staying at the Peackock as a once in a lifetime experience. The pictures and descriptions do not do this place justice. Lars is such a great host and gave us a lot of information about surrounding areas and also the history of his wonderful farm. He took us in his 4 wheel drive and showed us buildings on his property that have true historical value, including a 1860 crop sharers store. That's the sort of building that you'd normally only see roped off on a tour.
Lars wife Cay gave me flowers on my birthday - a lovely gesture. Finn lived up to his celebrity status! Full of character and mischievousness.
The cabin was delightful and very clean with all the home comforts you need. The pool was a very welcome addition as it is very hot in June and we loved looking out to the fields whilst swimming in the cool water.
Cannot recommend this accommodation highly enough. We wish we could have stayed a lot longer."

The pool was great after a hot day riding with the top down. It was so quiet and peaceful . Just absolutely breathtaking scenery. Just needed more time. I will definitely be back and soon...

Stayed a few nights","The Delta Cottage is a nicely hidden spot not far from Indianola and the B.B. King museum, for the real Blues lovers. However, keep in mind about a number of things:
- ask Lars in advance the access code to the gate, otherwise you cannot enter the property (and it takes an hour for you to get in, as we had);
- the pool is sometimes not usable, we were there at the end of May and there was unfortunately no water in it (while we had explicitly chosen the Delta Cottage because of the pool);
- it has windows all around, not all of which can be blinded, so that means you will be up very early;
- and bring all the food and drinks (water and for your breakfast on the porch, among other things) yourself."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here while in the area for a baseball tournament that was being held at Delta State University, which is less than 20 minutes away. This small cottage on the farm for my husband and me was just perfect. It was so peaceful and beautiful there, and much better than being stuck in a hotel room. Being on the farm surrounded by the horses, Lucky the pig, Finn the farm dog, and the croaking of the frogs was so relaxing. The kitchen is small, but is well equipped with everything we needed. We would eat breakfast each morning on the screen porch while listening to the sounds of nature around us. The cabin is very clean and nicely decorated, with a rustic touch. Lars was not there when we arrived, but he contacted us to make sure we had directions and everything we needed when we checked in. During our stay, Lars gave us a tour of the farm and told us about his future plans for growth, including a baseball field. We brought our bikes, and went riding on the farm trails one morning. His house is next door in case you need anything, but far enough away so you have privacy at the cottage. Staying here was definitely one of the highlights of our trip."

The cottage is perfect for a retreat or a brief respite on a journey. I spent a month there and immensely enjoyed the experience. The setting is unusual for it is not simply perfectly flat fields, sculpted and maintained for farming. It is a farm with gently rolling hills (for the Mississippi Delta), pasture, cultivated fields, and woodland. The cottage looks out on a pasture that is a peaceful and serene setting. Lars and Cay Ely are outstanding hosts and make your visit to Peacock a wonderful experience."

Stayed one night","This place— tucked in the Delta down a gravel drive about 1/4 mile. A darling light filled one room cabin with a front and back porch, gliders and comfy couches on both. Inside you have a seating area with two good size leather chairs, a little writing desk, a small kitchen and two perfectly appointed beds—and I am a sucker for a nice bed. Crisp sheets, down comforter, an easy-to-read-by light ... right up against giant windows displaying a magnificent thunderstorm. I woke the next morning to horses playfully scampering in the field, cardinals scratching at the ground, a fog lifting— or maybe not lifting. So the weather wasn’t perfect, but the stay was delightful. This place was on my radar by recommendation of a friend, but we booked at the last minute when we decided we didn’t want to drive any further that day. Lars responded immediately and got there to meet us right away. ( He actually lives right there but wasn’t home at the time.)
And as soon as we loaded the car to leave he appeared to see us off.
We weren’t there at a time for tennis or swimming, but yes! Both are right out your door.
A wonderfully peaceful respite. A few days here and I’m thinking I’d find myself writing the next southern novel... I would stay again."

The cottage is comfortable and there are lovely thoughtful touches throughout. It would be an absolute dream in warmer weather with a pool and tennis court just outside as well as two porches to take in the view. Lars is an outstanding host and took us and our kids on a rip roaring tour of the farm which involved a swamp tour, picking pecans and turnip greens, petting horses and the pet pig and all round fun. Lars and family are lovely and generous and left us with a strong desire to come back as soon as we possibly can."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for an out of the way perfectly appointed accommodation this is the place for you. As a bonus you'll meet Finn - the cutest little Jack Russel terrier. Sit on your back porch and gaze out on the ""back 40"" and watch the horses cavort. You're 15 minutes from Indianola or Cleveland. The kitchen is small but functional, the beds HUGE. Lars wasn't there the first couple of days of our stay but the minor start up problems we had were solved quickly by text and once he came back Lars took us on a tour of the farm and explained his plans for developing the property. Very ambitious but that's the kind of guy he is. Rest assured that if you book you will have a stay to remember."

There was also a movie poster of “The Help” framed and signed by the actors hanging up by the entrance as well. This was not included in the pictures posted on Airbnb. It did make us feel very uncomfortable and uneasy staying for the weekend. The property also has ants. We left my son’s burger on the counter and when he returned to eat it he could not because it was covered in ants."

The bed was very comfy (after a Viking Cooking School class about 15-20 minutes away in Greenwood). The hosts were so easy to communicate with. (Thanks Bill for the restaurant recommendation.)

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this properties pool house was more than sufficient and very comfortable! Plenty of towels, comfortable bedding, kitchen dishes, ice, bath robes, etc., were provided! plenty of seating inside. Very cute and nicely decorated. It feels very homey. Our one time needing communication was promptly available and they were super nice to speak to! The pool is an awesome bonus . We spent our Friday walking downtown Greenwood shops, ate at the Crystal Grill, our Saturday in the pool, and Saturday evening with a Viking cooking class! Great location to stay as an alternative to the Alluvian hotel. My only notation is that the outside area was a tad bit unkept adjacent to the pool and was “junky” and the porch furniture was pretty dirty and could have used a blowing off. It did not affect our stay in a large way - this was our only notable negative. There are also plenty of fans set i’m up so that you may still enjoy the porch in the Southern Delta Summer! this was a huge plus! I would definitely return to this property again& recommend!"

The house is as beautiful as the stories behind the property. They have thought of everything to make this space perfect. Beautiful pool and garden area, outdoor shower, quiet porch and sitting area, and the inside was welcoming and comfortable.
We would recommend this place to anyone and we would love to come back and spend more time than we were able to."

The house was sparkling clean & had everything you'd need to enjoy your stay. My wife & I felt very welcomed by our hosts but enjoyed absolute privacy while we were there. We felt so relaxed as we lounged by the pool & read our books in the oversized hammock in front of the fountain. The house is so tastefully decorated & the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept like babies! The outdoor shower is an extremely cool & unique feature that we very much enjoyed as well. The grounds are immaculately well maintained with a garden bursting with colorful flowers & fruit trees lining the back of the property. We loved taking walks in the evening down by the cypress lined river that runs in front of the main house. There is also a fire pit that Bill provided wood & fire starter for so that we could make s'mores! Our stay there was extremely peaceful & we left there feeling very refreshed. You know it's an amazing place when you're planning your next visit on the drive home, right!?"

Everything was so nice and clean and had plenty of towels for the pool. First time swimming in a salt water pool. Not a big fan however I'm sure it has it's perks. Love how big and unusual deep it was! Would have preferred it to not have been so murky but understandable it's still early in the year for swimming. The outside shower was delightful and so enjoyable! Makes you want to stay there all day however the hot water does eventually run out. Our weekend went by way to fast! Would love to visit again! My nephew and son was so excited about their new friends they made with the wild life. Coming home from vacation with pets is an unexpected treat!

This was the first time I've rented an Airbnb in which the host was on site. I had wondered how the experience might be different, and quickly realized it was in all the best possible ways! Bill greeted us and gave us a tour of the guesthouse. He's put a lot of time and thought into every detail and it shows. Speaking with him was like visiting with an old friend. His place is just as warm and inviting as he is.
A short drive to Greenwood to visit the local shops and restaurants made this location perfect. Bill gave us suggestions on places to eat and visit that were spot on.
If you're looking for a place to stay as a couple, family, or a girl's getaway you've found it! We can't wait to visit again ourselves."

We really enjoyed the beautiful pool and sitting on the front porch under the fans. The hosts provided bug spray as mosquitos are bad this time of year.

Four of us stayed there. My wife and I stayed in the bedroom. My daughter-in-law and her beaux stayed in the sofa bed. Everyone had a good night’s sleep, and there was plenty of space to not feel as if we were tripping over one another.

Stayed with kids","The house is lovely and looks exactly like the pictures, Even better! Very clean and has everything you will need for a wonderful stay no matter the length. A peaceful neighborhood to just sit outside and take in the scenery. Oh, and the local Double Quick has the best fried chicken we have ever had! omg gotta try it! The host was responsive to all my questions and made us feel comfortable. I would definitely book this house again!"

Stayed a few nights","I’m Cynthia was there for a home going of a loved on . The home was very inviting and remarkably. It was in a desirable area and the location was well maintained and well cared for. I also took a very close friend of mines in it with me to have a look around and she was very happy and excited how beautiful the home was . She’s from Florida so she actually said when she comes back to Mississippi she would love to stay there . I really appreciate the hospitality of the hostess and her caring attitude to help with anything that was needed and a plus the home had all the appliances you need, also she had water , soda, dishes, cook ware , snacks, many seasoning if you wanted to cook . It was close to stores also .
Thank you
Very Much!"

Stayed a few nights",I found Rubystein’s place to be very clean and comfortable. The house was beautifully furnished with particular attention to all the details for the best comfort. The bathrooms and showers were excellent and the price is definitely worth it. I am looking forward to booking with Rubystein again on my next visit to my hometown.

Stayed a few nights","This little house was absolutely perfect while we attended the Delta Tamale Festival in nearby Greenville. It was quiet, beautiful sunsets, comfy bed and everything we needed in the kitchen. It was the perfect landing spot to come back to and nap before going out to the night concerts. Brenda was friendly and easygoing!"

Stayed over a week","They are the nicest people that you can meet. Very attentive to any needs, but not intrusive on your stay. Brenda was very helpful on extending my stay several times. I was working in the area and did paperwork in the evenings. A very nice and quiet place. There are e few historical sites nearby. I was even invited to a local car show…but had to work. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This has to be one of our favorite places now. The pictures do no justice. This camp was the cleanest place we have ever stayed by far. Great appliances, comfortable furniture, plenty of room, and a stocked kitchen to list a few things we found amazing. The host is the kindest person and so responsive. We didn't want to leave. We hardly came in from fishing off the large pier that comes right out of the back door. A hidden gem to say the least. We discussed how soon to come back on the way home."
