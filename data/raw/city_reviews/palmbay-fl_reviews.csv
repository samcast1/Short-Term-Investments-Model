Stayed a few nights",I was so pleased with this experience. Kathleen thought of everything you might need while staying at her Airbnb. She is extremely helpful and answers texts immediately. The place was cozy and clean. I love it. If I stay in this area again for any reason I definitely have to make contact with Kathleen again. I give her 10 Stars for personality and professionalism!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Stayed with kids","Wonderful place in a great location. The space was clean. We were supplied with everything we needed for our stay. We were able to utilize some of the beach things supplied. We really appreciated the access to child supplies like a pack and play, stroller, high chair, etc. Short drive to the beach and parks. We can't wait to stay again!"

Stayed over a week","We were quite fortunate to find this great place. Kathleen was outstanding. Always available to answer our questions. The home was very clean and perfect for us. There is a Turkey Creek Sanctuary within walking distance. I walked and explored every day. We went to Canova dog beach daily. It’s close and the best dog beach I have ever been to. It is nine miles long!
There is a fish restaurant within walking distance that is fantastic.
The Shack Riverfront Restaurant & Outback Tiki bar. You can eat outside if you want and watch for dolphin in the inner-coastal waters.
If you want to be entertained or just enjoy your time at the house, this is the place to stay.
Thank you so much Kathleen (and Mack) for all of your kindness and hard work!"

It was beyond clean and the decor was very boho. There was a little courtyard with a fountain that was lit up at night. It really was beautiful. The nights were very quiet bed was super comfy. Unfortunately, I was so busy with family, I wasn’t able to enjoy this lovely place as much as I wanted to. I highly recommend staying with Areen. It’s a little piece of boho heaven!"

Stayed about a week","Areen & Julian are the most kindest, beautiful people that we ever met to Host us with AirBnB!! Super Host is an understatement!! From start to finish they have been amazing with outstanding hospitality and responsiveness. They have exceeded our expectations by going above and beyond to help us celebrate our anniversary. We were welcomed with 2 red heart balloons, roses, bottle of raspberry sparkletini, bath towels decorated as swans and a handwritten anniversary card. We were in awe!! In addition to our stay, the Boho Studio was so clean and fully stocked with snacks, beverages, and a goodie bag. They had a folder with suggestions to local restaurants and attractions. We recommend that if you stay here to visit the nearby Turkey Sanctuary center and walking trails. For dinner, we tried Osaka and were not disappointed! This beautiful place is a hidden gem and we highly recommended that you stay here! Thank you so much, we will be back soon to stay again!! 🥰🥰🥰"

The bed was comfy and clean, there were snacks and drinks waiting for us, a very nice bathroom with a bidet, an ironing board, tooth brushes incase we forgot ours, and a hand written note for us! If they are available next time I’m heading down to Melbourne, I’m 100% booking with them again, I would be hard pressed to find an Air BnB this amazing for this price range anywhere else, my fiance wants to live there now haha"

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect for our 4 day stay in Palm Bay. The apartment suite was FULLY EQUIPPED with every little detail. Areen had even put mouthwash and hand sanitizer in gift bags for us, along with a hand written note.
You have full privacy. The place is immaculate and has good a/c. There are plenty of towels and washcloths. They even had a wine bottle opener!
We wanted for NOTHING. oh...there were even beverages in the fridge and snacks for us!
The private patio outside is adorable and perfect for looking at the stars at night.
I will definitely stay here again if I return to the area.
The hosts are very friendly.
The bathroom is modern and the whole decor is Nice!
Also there were excellent light blocking curtains so we were able to sleep in.

Stayed a few nights","The house was spotless & super clean. The host had excellent response time & was very accommodating. We were a little concerned about the jacuzzi being turned on by the host because it's a huge requirement anywhere we stay. We use it nightly and even sometimes in the day depending on the outside temp. But Marisa had great response time and changed the time settings to what we requested. The jacuzzi was hot and clean and perfect for what we were looking for. The location is great.....super quiet and private. The bed was slightly hard for our taste but I know everyone is different. One tip I would give is the space is a bit bare, it almost seems like a staged home. I forgot my steamer & it would have been nice if there was an iron there, which I couldn't find. Along the same tone I would say a towel closet with multiple beach & shower towels vs just the 2 pool towels that we were left. These are just minor things....overall the stay was great and Marisa was a fabulous host."

Stayed a few nights","Our family Christmas was delayed due to illness so we decided to reschedule and get an Airbnb, best decision.
Booking was super easy. The house was very clean beds and shower were like high-end hotel quality.
It was almost just like being at home. We had everything that we needed. We could’ve used a little bit more in the kitchen as far as being able to cook and prepare food for our family. We had brunch served for them before we started in on our Christmas celebrating.
We were comfortable in the bed. I had to ask about the pillows because I want to set for my home very comfortable. Everything was clean and the hosts communication was perfect.
We really did enjoy our stay and will be doing this again next year for our Christmas again and I’m talking to my husband about using the same place. The pool was warm. The spa was just right and we felt secure with the cameras around the house.
Great stay and we will be doing it again!!!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed here to visit family nearby over NYE weekend. Nice Palm Bay house; well maintained. The heated pool was a hit with the kids even in January, and the hot tub was a relaxing feature for our family to use. House smelled fresh and clean upon entry which was also a nice touch.
The only minor critique I can think of including is to have more variety of cooking supplies and kitchen essentials for meal preparation. However, this seemed like a fairly new Airbnb listing, so I’m sure that will improve with time.
Overall, we’d definitely stay here again!"

Lindsey was great - allowed us to check-in early since we were arriving several hours ahead of schedule ...

Stayed a few nights",This place was wonderful. Lindsey was a great host and very responsive. My husband fished every day off the dock and saw dolphins and manatees everyday. The home was clean and had the most comfortable beds. This is a home we would gladly stay at again.

Group trip","Lindsey and Gerald are on top of it. Thank you both you were a blessing. Place is great. We fished off the dock. We caught two kinds of catfish, crab, tarpon, sheephead, mangrove snapper, mullet, and stingrays (3). We saw manatees, dolphin, sharks, and alligators.
We strongly suggest fishing after dark because if you catch something you can see bloluminesance in the water. The sharks came about 10 to 11 pm. You could see them swimming because of the bloluminesance.
The place was very clean and conveniently located. You cant beat the views. Manatees swim right next to the dock every morning and evening.
Great trip. Thank you both. What a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","This was such a wonderful property! Everything about the property was top quality. The photographs did not do it justice. The kitchen was well stocked with condiments we weren’t expecting, pots, pans, and dishes of high quality. The property is obviously well cared for. The bathrooms were spotless with plush towels and wash cloths. The outdoor space suited us perfectly. Having access to a BBQ grill was great and the patio area was very peaceful. The dock accommodated our boat perfectly and we were able to fish right there. The dolphins and manatees put on quite a show for us every afternoon. Always special to see them. This is a special place and we plan to return."

This house is well-stocked with everything you could possibly need on your trip, to include things you don’t necessarily need, but would probably want to have on hand! Not only that, but this home was impeccably clean. Perfect getaway; we had an amazing time here and will be back! Thank you for having us, Lindsey!"

Lindsey was a gracious host and even allowed a few of our family members drop by to say hello. The kids brought their fishing poles and we all sat out front watching the dolphins play while the sun set. Everything in the home is easy to locate and the beds were super comfortable. It's so wonderful to stay at places like these versus hotels. If you get the chance to book this home please do not hesitate. Huge thanks to Lindsey for allowing us to stay and create memories to last a lifetime!"

Stayed a few nights","The Cleanliness of the house was spectacular. The kitchen is appointed ok, could use more dishes, bowls etc. the back porch overlooking the yard and water is wonderful. The only negative about the location is the nearby train tracks and main road were loud at times.
We did have one major issue during our stay. There was a very strong sewer gas smell coming from the bathroom by the bedrooms on the second day of our stay. The owner, who lives nearby, was very responsive to address the problem. The smell went away, returned a day later, then went away again, which was very frustrating for both us and the owner as the cause of the smell could not be determined. Not wanting to risk the smell returning, we were not able to use the bathroom the remained of our stay and no partial refund was offered by Lindsey or airbnb after we asked which is very disappointing. So, if the source of the very foul sewer smell has not been discovered and corrected, beware."

Magnificent screened room overlooking the harbour, perfect for eating and relaxing. Great dock and grounds to watch the dolphins, fish, birds, and wildlife, and lovely quiet neighborhood for walking. One thing to note: the place looks across the water to A1 highway, which can get busy and loud, something which took getting used to in contrast to the perfect serenity otherwise. Lindsey was great to deal with, very quick to respond, very attentive and helpful, everything you look for in a host. Thank you."

I came to work remotely and had great internet, no disruption on Zoom calls. Definitely a great place for a work-cation. The owners thought of every detail and we had everything we could have needed! The guide book covered every detail perfectly. We happened to be here during Hurricane Nicole - the host updated us quickly and we felt safe and in good hands the whole time! Thankfully the storm impact was minimal but we would have been prepared for anything! The home is situated close to so many things - I went running on the causeways, visited local sanctuaries, popped into a few yoga studios, and checked out dining hot spots. My grandfather accompanied me and mobility is an issue. We were able to park right at the door and it was easy for him to get around the house too. Absolutely recommend this home for anyone looking for a relaxing stay - especially if you like sunset on the bay front!"

It was sufficiently stocked with everything we would need - making us feel at home! Who would have imagined seeing dolphins right from the living room?! It was a treat to sit in the living room and watch the shimmering waters and the diving dolphins. The yard was always so inviting and we enjoyed hanging out there whenever we weren’t in the screened porch area or the living room. The owners have an awesome barbecue grill set up Everything about the property was just awesome! The dock where we did some fishing was our next favorite. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay there and we would do it again of we get a chance."

We saw manatees, dolphins, opossums, all sorts of cool fun nature. I highly recommend this place 10/10 stars."

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed our 2 nights stay in the place. The room was very comfortable and homely and looked exactly the same on the photos. Instructions on how to check in were clear and precise and Anthony was a responsive and helpful host! He made our stay in Palm Bay relaxing since we were a little bit busy out during the day time. I would recommend Anthony's place to anybody and will probably book again the next time we go to Palm Bay.

Stayed one night","We only stayed one night at Anthony's place, but wish we could have stayed longer. The photos are exactly what was there, but in person it was way better than the pictures. It was a beautiful place and immaculate. A lot of care is put into the suite to make it just right. The bathroom was huge, cute walkway coming in, and overall was great. Host was very responsive to all my questions. All the places we have stayed are very nice, but this one has been the prettiest and our favorite so far. Would definitely recommend, and we will stay again if we are ever in the area and need a place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","Simply put - It was a great place. Host thought of everything. I'm talking 100% organic cotton sheets, whole bean coffee with grinder, to-go cups, amazing bathroom, microwave, etc. Seamless check-in, check-out. Extremely clean environment. Quick to the highway to get to local attractions like Brevard Zoo (amazing by the way!) and downtown Melbourne. Very professionally done and we highly recommend."

Stayed one night","The place was very clean and new looking. There were plenty of extra blankets and the bed was comfortable. Most everything that you need for a night or 2 was provided. The shower was great with plenty of hot water. I liked that the lights on the walkway to the back were motion activated. I would have liked it if the 2 lights on either side of the the garage stayed on at night, that would have made unloading the car at night much easier. I only had one real problem with the place. There is no controllable thermostat. If you like it between 69 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit you'll be good. I like it a little warmer and it was a very cold day and night. I texted Anthony and he raised the temperature a little and it helped but I would have liked it a little warmer. I didn't want to pester him so I didn't text him again. The extra blankets helped a lot for the overnight. Putting in a separate heating/cooling system is a major expense, so I would understand if he leaves it as is."

My husband, two friends and I wanted an Airbnb in order to have space to relax during our downtime as we were coming to a wedding. Any questions I had regarding the space was answered promptly. Additionally Ruth informed us a day prior about people who needed to come by in the morning. We didn't have to interact with them but I appreciated her informing us and giving the option to say no if we weren't comfortable. A couple things to consider. There are no ceiling fans and the air conditioning controls are locked behind a lock box. When we arrived it was set to 73, and in Florida, it was too hot. Definitely be prepared to bring a fan. Otherwise we would definitely recommend this house when looking for a short stay!"

I had asked Kathy, if by chance there was a chess set in the house and she said ""no, sorry"". When we checked in, there was a brand new game set that served our needs perfectly. What a pleasant surprise and gesture. The home is located in a very quiet neighborhood, about five to ten minutes from just about anything you need, 10 miles to the Indian River and 16 miles to Melbourne/ Indialantic Beach. Rent his house, you will be happy."

Stayed a few nights","Accommodation is outdated, a bit dark, furniture is very old and bed is well laid out. Cleanliness leaves something to be desired.
Amenities for cooking could also be better, there is very little equipment available.
Swimming pool and open space are shared with owner Pool was not cleaned and therefore could not be used during our stay.
Highway is not far away, so it's noisy in the garden.
Price is too high if you look at all the details. On our Florida Road Trip, there were significantly better Airbnb's in this price range."

Bunches of cars & boats parked all over the front yard! Debris in “closet” that was really a makeshift plywood wall separating two spaces. Connecting doors with a hook type of lock. Shower was old and in bad need of calking and repair. I wouldn’t put my dog in this place. Neighborhood In run-down area with scattered garbage and junk in yards piled high. Not a safe area."

They got in my bags of food I sat down on the counter. There were noises I didn't recognize at night in the kitchen and it appeared there were people in the main house connected to mine. The house was more like a hotel room with a full kitchen...It was old and needed some updating.. The price was ok for what it was..The bed was very comfortable..and the host was very prompt with answering back my emails.
I stayed for 6 days coming from Maine to Florida while a friend recuperated from illness..I would not recommend for a lengthy stay until the place is cleaned thoroughly and updated.. FP from Maine"

The Wi-Fi comes and goes just like the hot water in the shower. I’m not sure what the $50.00 cleaning fee is for.

Stayed one night","We had problems with the lock and we finally got it to open but never heard back from the host or any follow up. Very poor communication. The Wi-Fi kept going out every few minutes. We had to restart the TV 6 times to watch a 2 hour movie. This morning, we started watching another movie and we had the same problem. It worked for a minute and then froze so we had the exact same problem but ended up just giving up on the movie. Pretty disappointed honestly. This was the first Airbnb we've stayed at, that had no water in the fridge or even a hairdryer. Every single place has had the essentials, even a gallon of water. There was no soap in the dispenser and hardly any body wash. The towels were obviously clean but very used and had stains on all of them. The bathroom door needs to be fixed because it scrapes and gets stuck. It's very noisy. The photos on Airbnb were misleading because certain things were not in the bathroom and the shower needs to be redone. This place could be nice if time and care was put into it."

Kitchen okay, includes basics for two people but also has a bullet blender...but no ice trays for those frozen drinks. Again, adequate, not luxury, quiet, comfortable bed, good value relative to other properties in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Great location for a long weekend in Florida. Quiet neighborhood, house has everything you'd need. It won't blow you away, but it is most certainly maximum value for the low price and looks exactly like the pictures. If you're a couple and just looking for a place to sleep for the night while spending all day out and about, this is the place for you.
Just a short Uber-ride to Downtown - about 5-10 minutes by car. The backyard is as-advertised and while we didn't actually use it (weather was too cold) it looked very nice and I can see people having a good time back there with the pool table and in-ground pool. Covered driveway and easy check-in with the keycode for the door. James was easy to communicate with and was around the entire time we were there. If we needed anything I would just catch him outside or knock on his door.
I usually have trouble sleeping outside of my own home, but not this time - this is probably the most comfortable bed I've slept on between hotels/AirBnBs and it's not even close. My wife and I were both pretty surprised at how comfortable the bed was and we have both traveled quite a bit!"

Less than 2 miles from downtown, we ended up walking there and back. wouldn't suggest doing it alone, as you pass a lot of old junk yards and acrossed a seedy bridge. it's also a 4 minute drive/uber. bed was pretty comfy, temperature was good. I slept great, but my husband is a light sleeper and the road sounds/train kept him up, so plan accordingly if you are sensitive to noise."

Two refrigerators provide plenty of space for food and beverages. The a/c works fine. The Internet access is exceptionally fast with 125 Mbit/sec download speed.
The pool and large outside space is another appreciated feature. You have all you need for a short or longer stay."

Gosh, I cannot say enough about it.
The location of the house was really good too... everything you could ever need was like a short drive. Super close to the beach and downtown and in a great neighborhood.
And James was a rockstsar host. He replied immediately to my messages, was super accommodating with our minor issues, and was super fun to chill with playing darts. We could NOT have asked for a better stay. Thank you, James!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Grossed out man! Food crumbs on the kitchen counter when i arrived and cobb webs by the sink. Cobb webs hanging from the ceiling...and the grand finale...four large spiders in the shower. Dust on the couch. Dust on the coffee machine and overall dusty. Floors were not swept well.  Smelled a little like stale smoke when you first walk in. I wanted to enjoy the porch and outdoor areas but the cushions, table and everything outside was covered in dust and dirt and with more huge spiders and cobb webs in places. Dirty bowls, plates, and silverware with old food dried onto multiple dishes... Didn't trust anything after all that so i had to clean everything. I wanted to give the host the benefit of the doubt because he seemed like i friendly guy but i would never stay here again. If you do stay here, the lock is broken so you need to type the code in twice for it to work. The first time, the lock blinks red so it makes you think its the wrong code. Type it in twice so it works."

Stayed one night","It's a lovely spot!! If you love having your own detached private space, this is the spot to book. Easy to check in and glad I could do it at my own time -- self serve. Very quiet location -- the street it's on is a dead end and barely traveled so no traffic noises and no ambient light at night so you can sleep peacefully. Super comfy bed. Apartment was spotlessly clean and cozy. Great television set if you want to watch -- free cable. Love the towels and all the little touches that remind you to go to Palm Bay which is super close and pristine, beautiful. I'm a runner and there are lots of places to jog past -- parks, the Bay sit and watch spots etc. Cindy is super responsive, kind and friendly and though you never get to meet her IRL, it feels as if she's taken pains to ensure you have every single bit of info you need, and pictures to guide you through your stay. Feels as if we hung out and were best friends. Thanks, Cindy, for helping it be a successful trip."

Stayed a few nights","We recently stayed here for 5 nights while visiting relatives. This place is just right. It has everything you need for a stay. It's cozy. It's artsy. It's eclectic. A great place to be to kick back after a full day out. It is outfitted for all your needs. There is super nice little nursery just down the road that you can walk to and explore his creations. To be honest, this is a tiny but really neat place to stay but if you're on the larger size, say 6+feet and 200+lbs you may be cramped. As long as we have relatives in the area we'll be back to this place. Oh, and you'll love the roosters crowing from somewhere in the neighborhood - that was a nice surprise! Not enough to wake you up in the morning but to appreciate the area while sipping a cup of coffee in the morning or a cocktail at night on the outdoor furniture. Thank you Cindy."

The location was perfect: A quiet neighborhood without a lot of traffic or touristy nonsense, but no more than 20 minutes from some beautiful beaches, shopping, and dining.
Overall, this place was *spotless*. No dust, no dirt, no grime, no critters. So clean and relaxing.
The bed was nice and cozy, and the sheets were sooooo soft! There was even closet space to hang some clothes and cubbies for my jammies.
The kitchen/dining/living room area was everything could have wanted. I loved coming ""home"", kicking off my shoes, grabbing a drink from the fridge, and collapsing onto the couch to watch Jeopardy.
The bathroom was immaculate and... small :-) I'm 5'10 and struggled a bit. If Shaq is reading this review right now, think twice. Elijah Wood, you'll do fine here."

Stayed over a week","Listing was clean, nicely decorated, and is close to Walmart and restaurants. There is a stove, washer, and dryer in the space, but not available for use. B/c the space is attached to the main house, I could often smell food being cooked throughout the space. I messaged the host about a clothing iron and curtain for the bedroom window. Host was quick to respond, but unable to accommodate requests. As others have mentioned, the home is located on a frequently traveled road, so backing out of the driveway will take a bit of patience. Also, If you're a light sleeper, you will NEED ear plugs. Overall I had a good stay and the price point fit my budget requirements. If it weren't for the road noise, it would have been a great stay. I would recommend this listing for singles or couples who plan to dine out a lot and don't mind noise."

They left an outdoor light on and door open to help us access easier in the dark. The space is completely separate (great privacy) from the main house and is connected to the garage which has been converted into a kitchen. Both rooms were air conditioned and spotless.
We especially appreciated the amenities. They provided all necessities, bath essentials and kitchen items. They also stocked a few water bottles in the fridge which was great. They even had a box fan for those like us who can’t sleep without some noise!
It looks like they’re in the process of hooking up the stove and washer/dryer. Other than that, this place was awesome. The price was perfect and it was exactly what we needed being about 20-30 minutes away from exploring Melbourne, Vero and Sebastian.
Thanks for a great stay!!"

Stayed about a week","Orlando's place was very clean and they were very responsive to needs. Overall for the price, it's well worth it.
A couple things that are worth note: there was no stove or washer or dryer for use, very noisy road (bring ear plugs), no sharp knives for cutting."

Stayed a few nights","The place was very clean and nicely decorated. The space is a spacious, converted garage, which was not a problem. Various shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. Two gas stations are at the opposite. Melbourne Beach and Kennedy Space Center are easy to reach. All in all we can recommend the property! Thank you :-)"

Stayed a few nights","I did not speak to David much but his mother (Maria) is a real Sweetheart of a woman. She drove us to Melbourn, the mall, the beach, etc.
The apartment was VERY clean and we appreciated that! I mistakenly thought that the place was a lot closer to the beach than it was but that was my mistake.
My wife worked from the apartment, via remote access, and it was fine. Internet and TV was good. The kitchen is nice but it is located in a converted garage area. This did not bother me much but it might be a problem for others. The bedroom and bathroom are inside the house (Very Nice).
I would stay with David and his mom again if the opportunity presented itself."

Stayed a few nights","The place was very nice. Clean, classy, and lots of room! The shower was hot and water pressure was great! The only negative would be it's on a very busy road and you get all the things that come with that. But the items that were in the hosts control were superb. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in."
