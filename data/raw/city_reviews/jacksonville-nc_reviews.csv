Stayed a few nights","John was an amazing host, communication was quick and easy to work with. The place was absolutely very clean and very cozy. It felt like being home. Very closed to camp lajun and he was able to accommodate us for the days needed. We droved 9 half hrs to our daughter birth and booked the same day. Te area was very quiet and the place defenetly makes you feel at home. I will defenetly will recommend Johns place and will be booking again with him if need to. Overall I will give him 5 out of 5 stars."

The house itself was spacious and beautifully decorated. The bedrooms were comfortable, and I appreciated the thoughtful touches like extra blankets and pillows. The kitchen was well-equipped, making it easy to prepare meals during my stay.
The location was ideal, close to restaurants, shops, and attractions.
Overall, I can’t say enough good things about this Airbnb. The host’s hospitality, the comfortable accommodations, and the great location all contributed to a fantastic experience. I can’t wait to return for another visit!"

We sat at the dinner table and in the livingroom which is what I was hoping for while on vacation for a busy family. Bonding time was great! It was in a convenient location in Jacksonville and between beaches up and down the NC coast. We could not have asked for a better place during our stay.
Jeff was an amazing host who communicated frequently to make sure everything was well before and during our stay and sent over suggestions about restaurants, beaches, and places to visit. We would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is probably our all-time favorite place we’ve stayed so far! It is convenient to everything we like to do in Jacksonville. The decor is beautiful and tasteful.
It is spacious and roomy. The neighborhood is quiet… there were barking dogs next door, but I’m a dog person… so it doesn’t bother me.
Jeffrey is quick to respond. The electronic door access is convenient… and doorbell camera for safety is an added bonus!
We will definitely be back!"

Also suggested he leave instructions for the thermostat and washing machine. Had a lot of difficulties with Bring your own board games and cards — none in the house. Ping pong table was fun for the kids. Takes about 20 min. to get to the closest public beach access at Topsail Island. Beautiful! But no bathroom facilities.
The house was clean and well appointed with decor. Plenty of room for our family."

It was cold, windy, rainy and I was distraught..I asked David to call me which he did immediately and I proceeded to explain my situation and without hesitation he let me throw my little family gathering / baby shower there.. I was extremely grateful and will be forever thankful!!! 10 out of 10 on EVERYTHING.."

We traveled from NYC and David was kind enough for us to do an earlier than usual check in.
The decorations were minimal but tasteful. While looking for an Airbnb I looked for white linen, white towels and great reviews. The place was exactly as shown in pictures. The beds were comfortable, bathrooms were clean and comfy. The kitchen was clean with all amenities. We were even able to used some of the food stuff that was already in the house. The refrigerator is big enough to fit our foods and drinks.
Overall the stay was great."

The home is very unassuming from the exterior…clean yard, looks like the rest of the surroundings. Then you walk in and are transported to an social media influencer’s dream. This is what an Airbnb is about…a home straight out of imagination. The architecture used throughout the interior are choices I wouldn’t make in my own home, but are what also separates this place from others and makes it a fun experience."

The dishes were a little dirty when we showed up, and it seemed like a lot of the kitchen tools/pots and pans had gone missing from when we last stayed. Be careful of leaving your pets out back by themselves. The latch to the gate did not work, and it was very easy for my shepherd to open it up. Some small things throughout the house here and there. Also, the dryer hose wasn’t hooked up, which could’ve ended in a bad day. But overall not a bad experience."

You can’t stop nature, and they did everything in their power to help our stay remain positive. Had it not been for the roaches, they would’ve gotten 5 stars across the board from us. I wouldn’t go back to that home, but I would go back to those hosts. Outstanding group of people."

Stayed a few nights","The place was nice. We had to reach out to host and request the arrival instructions with code to house. After an hour and 3 attempts at contact they did finally message us. The place was comfortable, clean, and easy to find. We had trouble with the sink and reached out about it but didn’t get it fixed while we were there. So we ended up not using kitchen which was a bummer cause I like to save some money and not eat out all the time. Also we went to watch a movie on Netflix and it told us someone else was using that account at that time. Overall if the host fixed the kitchen issue and would be prompt on getting lock codes out before arrival day it would be a 5. But I just didn’t feel a connection with this host like I have with previous. Not very responsive."

Stayed with a pet",Loved staying here! It smelled clean and awesome hosts. Anytime we had an issue they where responsive. I will say that the neighbor next door would play music really loud all night and there is no dish disposal so the kitchen sink backs up. Because of this I don’t think it’s worth the price paid for. Other than those minor things it was an excellent stay. We would come back for sure!

We will always use Robin’s house when we travel here from MI. Robin is very quick to answer my texts if I have a question and I so appreciate this.
Thank you so much for having such a beautiful home.

Stayed over a week","Robin totally went above and beyond to house me for a 3 month stay this summer. The house is equipped with everything you’ll ever need. She was constantly checking in on me (especially after bad storms) and making sure that I had everything I needed. She was always quick to respond to any questions I had; always answered within 5 minutes of me getting in touch! Not only was the house amazing, but Robin and I become very close. Robin is a rare soul to find — she’s incredibly kind and really finds passion in caring for others. She always invited me to Sunday funday at her house with her friends and family. I’ve made a friend for life and we agreed to stay in touch!"

There was a little bit of everything that you would need on a trip! The yard is nice and big and seats to relax and sit down. The kitchen had all you need and there’s even some things for a baby or kids. Definitely will stay here again if I head back that way. Quiet neighborhood and the neighbor I did meet was sweet. We had zero issues with our stay. And she has really good smelling shampoo and conditioner and lotion for you! Her communication is very fast and she doesn’t ask for much but to be respectable. I give her a 10 out of 10!"

Everything you need was on hand- coffee maker (single cup Keurig style) with K cups creamer sugar supplied—pots pans dishes soap trash bags paper products even individual shampoo conditioner and soaps in the bathroom! (kitchen was supplied for four- I don’t know if there would be more plates/silverware for a larger group or if the unit is rented with a maximum of four- was plenty for our group) Beds were so comfortable and the pillows are unreal- heavy plush material I can’t even properly describe! Big fluffy towels for the bath and SUPER hot water with strong water pressure!! 19 minutes door to door from my son’s work on base so location was perfect for lots of visiting!! Robin is a great Airbnb host and I highly recommend her home!

The neighborhood has many homes, and this home felt especially private due to the location and the layout of the floor plan. The home is so thoughtfully decorated from the furnishings to linens to dishes. The entire home was spotless, and had everything we needed to feel at home. The owner was available even though we never needed him. The entire stay was a great experience and we would love to stay again in the future. This was our first Airbnb experience, and I am sure that this place has raised the bar! We are so grateful for this opportunity to say ""Thanks!"" and express on this review how pleased we are!

The house has a lot of space with luxurious amenities, including a spacious common area and three cozy bedrooms. The festive and inviting back porch was neat, perfect for evening relaxation.
Daniel is an amazing host. He is proactive, responsive, and very thoughtful. His personal touches were heart-felt and special to my family. When we walked into the house, we were welcomed by Christmas trees and a holiday wreath, already lit up and festive. What an incredible welcome. It set the tone for the rest of our stay.
I wholeheartedly recommend this home and eagerly anticipate our return. A heartfelt thanks to Daniel for an unforgettable experience."

The pictures do not do this place justice!! It is absolutely beautiful. and that goes for everything, from the outdoor patio, to the indoor patio, to each room of the home itself. I was able to cook my entire thanksgiving feast in his kitchen. I brought many things from my own kitchen with me, as I was not sure what his kitchen would have in it. However, I ended up needing very little of what I brought as his kitchen was plenty stocked with all sorts of kitchen amenities and tools. The home was warm and inviting and Daniel was an excellent host. I truly can't say enough good things about him and his home. This is the only place we'll be staying when we're in town. I'm certain you won't regret your stay either :)"

Stayed with kids","We came to Jacksonville for my daughter’s baby shower, and I chose Daniel’s home based on all of the reviews. When we arrived, the home was immaculate, and actually even better than the pictures on Daniel’s listing. The home is beautifully decorated with all of the amenities you could need for your stay!! Daniel went above and beyond to make our stay convenient and comfortable, he even had the cleaning person bring over brand new beach towels and chairs that were mistakenly taken by the previous guests. Whenever I would message with a question, his response was prompt, courteous and helpful. The beds are super comfortable, and the rooms are very spacious. There is also a desk in the MBR if you need to work remotely. We will most definitely stay at Daniel’s home for our future trips to North Carolina!!"

Stayed a few nights","Daniel and Gissel make every inch of their property useful! In addition to the beautiful decorating and the soft music playing when we entered 107 Foxberry Place, we immediately fell in love with the outdoor space. The screened porch was our favorite hang out! What made the rear outdoor area so special was the privacy, which is very unusual in a recently developed area. The kitchen is well-equipped for making a family meal, living /dining area is comfortably accommodating and beds and bath offer relaxation in the appointments.
The owners checked in on us shortly after we arrived , and were very responsive to our questions and needs. We met a few neighbors that we found to be welcoming and friendly.
Due to the weather we didn’t get to use the deck and the pool, but know that other guests will enjoy these amenities.
Thank you, Daniel and Gissel."

Stayed with a pet","Obviously, there isn't an actual home owner who walks through the home . Bathrooms , dirty, I'll just leave it at that. The kitchen had ZERO supplies. No serving dishes, no glasses, just 4 coffee cups . Couldn't have leftovers. IThe refrigerator did not get cold at all. If there was an extra piece of wood, they put it on the wall for decoration. The fenced-in area grass was past my knees. I had to contact the management company to cut grass . Would not recommend."

Stayed with a pet","My stay was great, house was clean and I felt very comfortable. The only thing I can suggest is if you someone is staying there with a pet, make sure that the little fenced in yard is maintained. The grass was up to almost my knee until it rained. Honestly that was the most important amentity I was looking for when I booked it. Also, not being from the area, I'm not sure what kind of wildlife there is. (Meaning insects or snakes things like that.) I didn't trust letting my dog out there. I made her stay on the leash and only let her go as far as in front of the screendoor. Other then that it was perfect!"

Stayed with kids","My family and I had booked a room at one of the hotels down the street and it was just awful so I went on air bnb to see what I could get at the last minute. I found this place and a couple others. I signed in and signed up for two days stay here. Then there came the wait for approval, which was sent to me in less than 5 minutes, maybe less! They sent me the door code and a very friendly message. We went there and checked ourselves in. The place smelled so good. The kitchen was stocked with items to use to cook, but not very many items to eat. The dishes appeared to be spotless, as well as the kitchen and living room area. The downstairs half bathroom was clean and well stocked with hand soap and toilet paper. My daughter loved the automatic soap dispenser, which is in every bathroom, and this place has 3! Upstairs, there are 2 rooms with 1 queen bed and 2 full bathrooms! Also well stocked and super clean! Bed were comfortable. Loved the area, friendly neighbors. Don’t wait to book!"

Whose place has a sound machine to ensure you sleep well? Suzanne’s does! And don’t get me started on the luxurious sheets and towels!!! I even checked out the brand name they were so nice.
The only issue I could imagine anyone having is if they are tall. The ceiling is slanted since it’s an upstairs apartment, but it was perfect for me. I would definitely stay here again! I was traveling by myself and felt very safe as she lives on the premises and to access the apartment you enter a gate that leads into her backyard. The privacy fence is tall enough that it’s truly private from neighbors.
It was a great place to stay in Jacksonville and Suzanne was happy to make restaurant recommendations upon my request. Trust the reviews! Well done, Suzanne!"

Not only was it beautiful outside and in a beautiful neighborhood, as soon as you walked in it was so inviting. Everything was in its place, plenty of fresh clean towels, every item you would ever need in the bathroom and kitchen. Suzanne even had two robes for us and snacks. It was absolutely the BEST AIRBNB we have ever been to. And Suzanne is such a pleasure to talk to, she felt like an old friend. She was so helpful in sharing withus about the best places to go in the area and told us about the beach at Camp Lejuene, which we were visiting for a ceremony. We highly recommend Suzanne's place to anyone who wants a ""feels like home"" experience. We will definitely return in the future."

Had a large refrigerator, oven to cook , lots of amenities that you might need(Just in case). She had a lot of everything available Just In Case. I was very impressed with her place. The only thing is don't be too tall unless you want to do a lot of squats. My friend was 6'3"" and really had to be very careful not to hit his head. But she said she's had a 7' 0"" man in there before and he never complained. We didn't either-The place is so cute and well decorated-You'll love it!!!"

The space was perfect for my wife and I. Lots of room, and was very clean. For the time we were there, Suzanne was there if we needed anything at all. Pretty much everything you needed was in that place minus your food and drink of choice. Bathroom was cozy and stocked with toiletries. Plenty of lighting and the sitting area with tv was nice to enjoy some games! There is a sitting area out back with nice lighting to enjoy the evenings. Over all, I have nothing negative to say about the Marine Courtyard. If I come back this way, I will definitely book again. Thank you so much for your hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","From the moment we arrived, I had the clear sense this would be a FIVE STAR experience - and it most definitely WAS! Suzanne was always responsive, the room was better than the photos let on, and the host had thought of all the perfect details to make the stay enjoyable for guests. The back patio area was a great private spot to unwind outside, the bed was amazingly comfortable, and the kitchen was fantastic for our needs. My wife and I enjoyed the park and boardwalks at the nature center nearby - both just a short stroll away - and the location was extremely walkable. Would highly recommend this place for short or even longer term stays."

Wow - I am so glad we did! Suzanne gave me a sweet birthday card that matched the theme of the whole room. She was so friendly, greeted us when we arrived, & bid us goodbye when we left. The place was absolutely spotless and everything was decorated so thoughtfully! It was such a cozy stay. We will definitely be coming back again the next time we visit! 🙂"

Stayed one night","Without a doubt, we'll return to this property. Suzanne was the most gracious host. The home had everything one could need when away. It was so warm, super clean, and cozy. The amenities were top-notch. I've not stayed at an air B&B with softer towels than the ones provided. The bed and bedding made for a wonderful night's rest. We had one question upon our arrival about the house. Within minutes, Suzanne and her husband responded and met the request. I told her I was cold natured and needed a lot to warm. My hubby and I left to get dinner. When we returned, there was an electric blanket and a new pair of foot warmers at our door. She set the bar on hospitality. That is something money can't buy but is worth more than anything. Again, we'll certainly stay again when we come back to visit our Marine. Thank you, Suzanne and family, for opening your home to us.

She answered any questions we had and her response time was super fast. The place was amazing! Felt just like home and was very comfortable. Had everything we needed for our stay plus more. The air conditioning was super cold which is perfect because my wife and I get hot easily. Multiple ceiling fans and also an oscillating fan which is a plus because we like a lot of noise at night. The king bed was awesome, very comfy! Would give more than 5 stars if we could. We will definitely be back and would definitely recommend to everyone else!"

Stayed a few nights","The host ( Suzanne ) was very accommodating, we traveled a very long way to see our son graduate from his schooling on the New River Air Station. By the time we finally got into town we had already been up / awake and in transit for about 24hrs. The stated check-in time i believe was 4pm..i messaged her to ask if it would be ok if we checked in 4 hrs earlier at 12:00 noon, Suzanne was very quick to reply and she said that would be fine. In advance of our arrival she turned on the AC for us so that the room would be nice and cool. Everything about the room was in excellent condition, the bed was very comfortable, everything was very clean. Everything you could possibly need to survive is inside of the unit. Cooking, cleaning, bathroom supplies, linens, towels etc, etc. The TV is a ""smart TV"" and it also has a Firestick hooked up to it, so you can have access to all kinds of programming. Theres a strong wi-fi signal in the unit.
The neighborhood is excellent, very nice homes, everyone seems to take pride in ownership. The proximity to MCAS New River and Camp Lejeune and all of the things that Jacksonville offer could not be better. The room is above a detached garage that is next to the owners residence. We never heard so much as a peep from anyone at the house, nor any road noise. The street directly in front of the house has a very low volume of traffic, and its in a upper end residential area, so the speed limit is slow and in general the folks driving by tend to be more mature and respectful of their neighbors, hence we never heard any racket coming from the street. Excellent stay 10 out of 10!"

The space is so cute & cozy & feels just like home. It’s also very clean & organized. There’s a kitchen & coffee pot w/ all the essentials plus some, body wash & bubble bath soap, a hairdryer & plenty of towels, washcloths, etc. The bed is sooo comfortable, there’s a smart TV where you can watch anything from Hulu, Netflix, & other streaming services, plus the couch is comfy. At the end of our stay, I forgot one of my favorite dresses at the apartment. Suzanne went out of her way to message me & let me know, & out of the kindness in her heart, even offered to send me my dress in the mail free of charge!! I couldn’t have asked for a better stay, we will be back in the future, thank you so much Suzanne for our wonderful getaway ❤️"

My husband and I stayed here after our wedding. We live here locally but we’re looking for a little getaway after our “I Dos” that was different from a hotel. This offered us a more cozy and intimate setting. I can’t thank Suzanne enough for all the amenities and hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","Expect the best. Great location, close to parks, water, downtown, cafes, and freeways. Suzanne was a joy from start to finish. The space is spacious, clean, well stocked, and has all the essentials one would need for their home-away-from-home. Oh and the bed and couch just ""draws you in""; warning - you might get stuck being a couch potato and have the TV watch you while your eyes are closed.
Suzanne checked on my through out my stay once my travel plans changed from a 2 person trip to a 1 person trip. Oh and the neighborhood and the locals are extremely nice. I plan to return since I met some really cool people while visiting Jacksonville NC and Suzanne's space is everything I needed (and then some)."

Stayed one night","This AirBnB is wonderful! Staying here was an unforgettable experience. This was our first experience with AirBnB, we're certain that we'll remember this as our finest stay ever.
We really loved the room. It was beautifully appointed, spacious, clean, well-lighted and accommodating. The linen was especially luxurious. We commented that this was like a luxury hotel room that felt just like home.
The coffee in the morning we brewed allowed us to slowly and luxuriously start the day. The USMC cups were a great touch and shows the care the hosts put into preparing the room. We didn't want to leave that morning and wish we could have stayed for several more days.
There is an inviting courtyard down the stairs from the large 2nd floor room. The separate outside stairway and entrance made coming and going a breeze.
We couldn't recommend this AirBnB more highly. It completely exceeded our expectations."

Nice neighborhood, friendly hosts, and they provided tips for restaurants where we could get good food within walking distance. They also provided basic necessities like shampoo, body wash, coffee, creamer, etc.. The unit was much bigger than expected, very cute, and very clean! We both said ""oh wow"" when we walked in and saw the big, open space and huge king sized bed! We would definitely stay here again if we were swinging through Jacksonville!"

Keani stayed in contact, was quick to respond, and even reached out to ensure everything was ok and if we needed anything. This would be a great place to stay whether you are visiting family/friends in the military or wanting a beach vacation away from the busy beach resort towns. I would highly recommend this if you are going to the Jacksonville area any time soon! I would give 10 stars if I could!"

Everything in the kitchen is labeled so it's very easy to find. They even had some goodies (some food in the fridge/pantry, cooking spices/condiments, coffee/K-Cup machine) so I didn't have to go buy a bunch of stuff. Overall, we had a great time.

Stayed about a week","Two words: worth. it.
Our hosts provided so many amenities - my husband and I felt like we owned the place! Enjoy some complimentary coffee at their coffee bar or watch your husband and friends play pool in the garage while you relax in the living room with your 75” television & fireplace.
Did you forget towels? Hair dryer? Detergent? Kids toys? Paper cups or plates? - don’t worry about it! This place has you covered and the hosts will do anything to make you feel right at home! Best AirBnB we have stayed at BY FAR! :)"

Stayed with kids",Host was very accommodating has a beautiful home and if any issues arise the host is very quick to respond. His cleaning crew does an amazing job. The home was very clean and orginized with everything labled. We were surprised at some of the stuff that was already in the home.We did our own food shopping at a few of the many near by stores(less than 10 minute drive.) We Cooked our own food and the house had all the stuff we needed to do so. The house is only 10 minute drive to get to the Marine Corps base. Which was our destination. The price was very fair and worth every penny. Thank you again for letting us stay my family enjoyed our time there.

They take pride in their home and have a great cleaning crew. Check-in details came right on time as expected and when we arrived we walked into a beautiful and clean home. The house was very family friendly and even had those little extra things that made it enjoyable and not need to run to a store. Overall a great place for a family."

The home had everything we needed and more (lotions, shampoos, toothpaste, high chair, toys, hair straightener, body spray, condiments, seasonings, etc). The neighborhood is very quiet and safe with a huge beautiful park in the backyard. It was in close proximity to beaches. Check out hammock state park and take the ferry to bear island. It’s absolutely stunning. We would recommend Keani’s home to other families!"

The pool table is a plus if you have time to use it. Close to many things. We recommend the ""Brewed Downtown"" for your morning coffee and breakfast.
The place is exceptionally clean...a little heavy on the fragrance. The back patio and seating is a wonderful outdoor oasis. A place to enjoy a quiet evening of downtime and rejuvenation. Our only negative is this is not a place for the physically challenged. Seating is low and hard to get out of. All things considered, we enjoyed our stay."

I feel like they should brag more in the listing because it’s better than what they say it is, but yeah….

Stayed a few nights",We love staying at Kathy’s place! (this 🙄 was our second time). It is cozy and feels like home. We are always able to relax and enjoy some down time. We enjoy chilling in the recliners as they are so comfy as are the beds. I also love the way it’s decorated right down to the cute little plants on end tables and nightstands. The neighborhood is quiet so it is very easy to get some much needed rest. The apartment is very clean and welcoming! We will be back! Thanks again Kathy! 😊😊

The apartment is very clean and the decor is serene which makes for a very relaxing stay. It is conveniently located to everything you would want to do in Jacksonville!"

If you are visiting a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune it’s only about 10 minutes from the Wilson gate.

I was able to do all my laundry before leaving thanks to the detergent that is left in the home and also able to cook full meals thanks to the kitchen being fully stocked with spices and pots and pans. Overall the experience was great lots of places to eat and the mall is just a 3 mins."

Stayed with kids","This apartment was exactly what we expected it to be. Very spacious and clean. Kathy was a great host. Returned phone calls and messages promptly. Although the apartment caters mainly to military personnel, my family stayed there to enjoy the beaches. This place is strategically located within a 1/2 hour from several beaches. North Topsail, Surf City, Topsail, Emerald Isle, Indian Beach, and Atlantic Beach, all within a pretty short car ride. But what sold us was that the cost of this apartment was a fraction of what it would have cost to stay anywhere on the NC Coast. Well worth a short car ride for those who are on a budget."
