Amanda is a WONDERFUL host and was extremely accommodating. Very responsive and provided us one of the easiest checkins I’ve had. The cute yard was perfect for my dog who loved running from end to end and the neighborhood was very nice to walk around in. Couldn’t ask for a better stay.

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at Amanda's Airbnb. She's an incredibly responsive host and went more than out of her way to add that personal touch that separates the Airbnb experience from the average hotel experience. The rental car desk closed before our flight arrived so Amanda graciously offered to pick my family of 5 up at the airport at midnight! She was friendly yet professional. The Airbnb is in a lovely quiet neighborhood in close proximity to the airport and MMA. It has a garage for parking, sufficiently stocked kitchen supplies, as well as perks like bottled water and snacks. We hope to be back and will recommend to other MMA families."

We have stayed at houses with a pool but that home feeling was missing. You will feel right at home with this house. The little things the other places didn’t even have coffee, paper towels, TP, cleaning supplies and other small things that made it feel like home.
Thanks!!!"

Group trip","This Arbnb felt like a home. It was clean and functional. It had all the necessary amenities. The AC system was amazing. It kept us very cool in the July Texas heat. The ceiling fans in each room was an added bonus for comfort. The beds were clean and very comfortable. The additional 1/2 bath in the living room was a bonus. The private 2 car garage with remote entry was great. We had our 89 year old mother with us. The ease for her to use the master shower with no high steps and built in seat was a big help.
The house is amazing but just as great was Amanda’s communication and response time. We some how accidentally unprogrammed the remote entry to the garage. Amanda came by within an hour and left us a remote the garage. The checking out process was the best we have ever had using an Arbnb. We will be back to visit family in the area. We will without a doubt be staying here again. We would highly recommend Amanda’s place to anyone."

Stayed with kids","Amanda was a FANTASTIC host! We had a delayed flight which caused us to get to the AirBnB 5hours late and past midnight. Amanda was so sweet, offered to stay awake to ensure we found it and got inside ok. She further offered to extend our stay by one night given our troubles with the flight which was the airlines problem, but she wanted to make sure our stay was nothing short of amazing. So accommodating. When we entered the house it was clean, cool, and exactly what we needed after getting there so late. She had a personalized handwritten note along side a welcome basket with fresh fruit, water bottles, granola bars, etc. My toddler was so excited to see that! She further gave us a child voucher for the zoo, which we used! And have tons of recommendations for things to do with my 2 year old. Everything was great and I’m so thankful for her hospitality."

Stayed about a week","They’ve earned every great review. Great location because I have family in the valley. Did the hotel thing but when two star hotels cost around $125 per night this place worked out perfect. I extended my stay due to a later funeral date. Anne and Patrick’s place was better than a hotel room and a great value. Split system A/C ran quiet and not sounding like those overgrown window units in hotels kept us plenty cool in triple digit heat. Really close to Ramses for Birria tacos, La Playa’s insane tender fajitas, drive to Weslaco for some Ranch House burgers and watching the Stros at Classics. So while you’ve wasted time reading my review, someone has booked this incredible spot. Safe and hopefully non-delayed travels.
PS the black out shades get a definite two thumbs up.

We have stayed here before and they have upgraded their room which now is even better than before (it was already pretty awesome). The hosts were so thoughtful since we got a late start on our trip and ensured we had everything we needed for our late arrival. There is off street parking that is easy to get into in and out of, plenty of towels, black out curtains - everything you need for your stay. I would highly recommend and I hope to stay again the next time we visit."

But as soon as I called the host because it was a little lost, he gave me the most accurate and signage instructions... once arriving we saw that it was very easy. The place was made very safe and very close to the shops. The literal room has everything you need. I had never had an Airb&b with shampoo and soaps.

They went above and beyond thinking of every detail you might need from dishes to paper towels to water to coffee to shampoo/conditioner, and more. Plus they are pet friendly, which was a requirement for us - and often hard to find and expensive. But not here! Great value. The bathroom was also recently updated and looks fantastic with the new tile! Highly recommend and will definitely be back."

Very responsive to any concers you have. Gate to keep your belongings safe.

Stayed a few nights","My BIL and I traveled to the area for a hunting trip. We were looking for a place where we could potentially park a trailer and where our gear would be safe during the day while we were out hunting. This location fit the bill perfectly. It was private, gated, and quickly accessible to the hunting unit that we drew our tags for. Jonathan was a fantastic host. Although we never had to contact him about any issues, I felt that he would have taken care of any needs that we may have needed. The place was extremely clean both inside and out, and everything looked as advertised. I would highly recommend booking here if you are in the area. Hopefully we will draw the tags again and book again in this location."

I would suggest a binder with internet password, and indications on where to leave laundry or expectations on what they would like the guest to have done before they leave as a guide. Rule of thumb for us was leave it as you found it but it would be nice to have expectations and a list of food places nearby etc.
Over all I really loved the place and would not hesitate to book again and recommend to family and friends."

I had asked at one point if he had a blender, toaster, and some other miscellaneous kitchen items tucked away somewhere in the house but he said he didn’t. To my surprise, when I got back to the house, there was a new blender, a toaster, and much more waiting on the porch. There are a lot of Airbnb hosts that wouldn’t do that. I also liked that we could lock the gate so that no one could even accidentally drive in. No reason to be on the fence about this place, just book it already."

Extremely clean and equipped with anything you may need for a comfortable home away from home. It appears to be a lot smaller than it actually was. It accommodated my husband, two young kids, our baby and I just fine. The location was perfect as we had most things we needed nearby. Carlos was super easy to work with and very responsive. The bed was also very comfy. Cleanliness and a comfy bed are what I am most picky about and this place exceeded those expectations. We will definitely consider staying here again in the future.

Hosts were amazingly responsive, even getting a drip coffee pot for us since we'd brought our own coffee. Appreciated that it was convenient for the mobility impaired with a walk-in shower, no big steps and no clutter to trip over. Their little book of instructions recommended Lara's Bakery, we never would have tried it otherwise, and it was absolutely a ""don't miss"" experience. All together, a pleasant stay and we hope to go again."

The host was very quick to respond and accommodating The things found were just unfortunate. I couldn’t sleep at all. I may be slept two hours due to be being constantly bitten by mosquitoes. however, upon letting the host know after I left, they did issue a refund which I believe is great customer service this issue may not be what you encounter but I would want to see honest review when deciding where to stay."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay in this little casita. It was clean and private and had lots of little extras. The location to the airport and my mom's nursing home was very convenient. Big thumbs up for the air conditioning! Good for families as it had an extra day bed. I don't know what other airbnb listings in the area go for, but I thought this was a very good value. We would definitely stay here again."

We truly enjoyed our stay! Quiet, relaxing, Totally seperated from home by a nice lil private backyard that is fenced in! Bed is comfy, clean linens, really clean in and out, nice size bathroom, kitchenette with 4 burner stove, full fridge, microwave, sink, toaster and Keurig coffee maker! True cottage in a safe and nice neighborhood! Near everything by 5 to 15 minutes!
Our chihuahua travels with us and was very comfortable there in his kennel! Personal parking spot as well! Pack your bags, book this listing and be happy ! The hosts were SUPER quick in response time and Mr. Patrick met us at the parking spot and had a great conversation ! The cottage and hosts made us feel great and enjoy our trip even more!"

Stayed a few nights","Annette and Patrick have created a very cozy and comfortable cottage. You can tell they put a lot of love and effort into it and thought of just about everything. The bed was comfortable and there's kind of a day bed that can serve as a sofa and/or sleeping space. There's a nice Samsung TV that gets beaucoup channels and there's a office workspace area with a really nice office chair. The kitchen is very well-equipped and has a full-size fridge with plenty of room. The bathroom is twice as big as mine back home (my bathroom is very small). The shower has good flow and the hot water came on almost immediately. The cottage is also in a good location. A couple of miles away is an H.E.B. grocery store, a Dollar General is just down the road and about a million excellent Mexican restaurants are ten minutes away. I chose La Playa and it was soooo good! I can't recommend this property highly enough."

Highly recommend Annette & Patrick's home if you are looking for a place that is very close to the airport where you have privacy and doesn't break the bank. We really enjoyed our time at their place. It was extremely clean and had all the added amenities that we could need.
Aside from a great home they are extremely hospitable. On our way to their house from San Antonio we hit a javelina along the way and Patrick helped us fix our bumper enough to get us home safely. He really went out of his way to help us."

Nestled amidst citrus groves bursting with fragrant life, vibrant flowers, and swaying palm trees that seemed to whisper congratulations, it felt like we'd stepped into a hidden paradise. Saying 'I do' surrounded by loved ones, with this breathtaking scenery as our witness, made the whole experience even more magical.
And the magic didn't end after the reception! Being able to retreat to a cozy guest house right there at The Grove after the festivities was the perfect way to end the night. Waking up the next morning, enveloped in the tranquil beauty of the venue, and knowing we'd begun our forever journey in such a special place, filled our hearts with pure joy. The Grove holds a piece of our love story now, and we can't wait to return in the future to reminisce about the start of our happily ever after."

It was a little dusty and maybe smelled like pets had been there before but they did say pets are allowed so understandable. There were lots of spider webs outside so we had to clean before the kids could play. The shower curtains were stained and didn’t look clean. The arcade room was really cool and the kids loved it and the kitchen was also well equipped. The antique room creeped me out but my four year old daughter thought it was pretty lol. Overall I really enjoyed my stay here and the few cons wouldn’t detour me from staying again.

Stayed with a pet","Highly recommend! Great house and location, neighborhood felt safe, nice backyard for the dog. They let us check in about 2.5 hours early on short notice when we got to town earlier than expected, which was really nice.
Pros:
-Clean
-Spacious
-No carpeting
-Nice fridge and freezer
-Back patio with seating
-Owners gave privacy and didn't badger us
-Multiple streaming apps with a guest account
-Recieved a reminder the day before trash day to put the bins out
-Easy to remember keycode
Cons:
-Towel racks in 2 bathrooms were broken
-Hot water doesn't get very hot
-Some cleaning details the cleaning crew missed
-The morning of check out I was emailed a list of check out rules, which I didn't see until after check out. I don't know if that was a list from Airbnb or the owner. Included things like stripping the beds of used linens, which should be included in the high cleaning fee."

We were extremely comfortable in the house as it provided more than we needed. The house was large enough to receive visits from family and friends but still in a very cosy setting. The only glitch to our visit was a power outage in the area due to weather but it was less than 4 hours and Lauren responded immediately once I messaged her and checked up on us until service was restored. We were very grateful that our host was able to accommodate us for two additional days due to a minor family emergency. Highly recommended! Our stay here has us planning a return visit much sooner than later.

Home had everything we needed to feel comfortable and sipping wine on the patio in the evenings was so nice. The hosts Steve and Angh were so friendly and helpful in letting us know nearby fun things to do during our stay. Will definitely be staying here again when in the area."

Despite the neighborhood not being the best, the interior of the apartment was a true gem. It offered a cozy and stylish retreat that made the overall experience outstanding.
The hosts who were incredibly welcoming and accommodating, have maintained an exceptional level of cleanliness, making it evident that they take great pride in providing a spotless and inviting space.

Cruz was quick to respond & he & his Mrs. came over early the next morning & got us connected right away! They were so kind & helpful!
We were so thrilled to have a place where we could cook & eat & relax after several long days in the dentist chair!
We were able to order groceries from HEB & they delivered. Very good service!!

Group trip","We were in town for a family birthday. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It is small but fit our needs perfectly. My two teenage daughters stayed in the master bedroom and loved the layout of the bathroom. From the outside, all of the apartments look the same and the address numbers were hard to see. So finding the right building was a little difficult since we arrived after dark. Also, the location is right behind a heavy equipment sales facility or warehouse and the employees played their music loud enough to hear in the apartment. It wasn't bad, just noticeable. I would stay there again."

Cruz is an excellent host. He went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable. We had one concern with the second bedroom, for our friend who has some mobility issues. Cruz quickly came up with a solution and came over to make the necessary changes. We were very grateful.
I recommend the Petal House if you are staying in the Harlingen area."

Stayed with kids","We had a lovely stay at the Cruz home. It is in a very quiet neighborhood. We stayed for 2 nights and never heard or saw a neighbor. The place was decorated beautifully and was spotless. A welcomed sight and very relaxing after a long day in the car. I really appreciated that they had coffee, creamer, sugar, salt and pepper…basic items that one might need. They also had a few bags of popcorn, oatmeal, and water too. Little touches like that (even though we didn’t use them) are really thoughtful and a blessing to a weary traveler. It shows they put thought into your stay. A lot of AirBnB’s have become stingy about stuff like that so it was fantastic to get there and have the basics provided. The location was about 5 minutes away from tons of restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping. Near the highway but not close enough to hear it or be bothered by it. Check in was very simple. Check out was simple too. The owner was very responsive. I would absolutely stay here again the next time we come to town."

Stayed a few nights","We traveled from GA to see my bonus son graduate from LHS. My mother lives in La Feria. I tried to find something in between. Came across this lil mustard house. I really didn't expect much for surrounding, only because I knew the area a lil bit, just needed somewhere to lay our heads and cook meals. Upon arriving the grass (weeds) where so tall that at first we was like, is this the place? Had to pull the weeds from the steps. Once we went inside it was clean and nicely decorated. Didn't expect that only part of the house was accessible. Wierd, but ok. The important parts is what mattered to me. 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. The place is small, explains why only max 4 ppl. Understandable, no prob. As for the kitchen. I wish there was more kitchen stuff available. Needed a strainer for the noodles I boiled and none available. Could use more cooking utensils, for example spoons and a variety of knives. Other than that. I really enjoyed my stay. Would use again, if needed to. 🥰"

Her and her husband were great hosts! The location was peaceful and the space was perfect. It was enough space for our family.

Let me just say Rachel blew it out of the water! It will be hard to replicate the experience again. From check in til check out Rachel was there every step of the way. This AitBnb had everything and then some. I definitely felt at home and welcomed every step of the way. I would recommend this place over and over again if I could.

The photos don’t do any justice the guest house was bigger than expected and in pristine condition. If you want safety, privacy this is a great location! Not too far from everything Harlingen has to offer. Rachel is very responsive and made the place feel like a home and provided extras in case we forgot something (toothbrush, ear plugs, shampoo and soap etc). I came from Houston area to visit my family and even they were in awe of the house. Make sure you choose this rental as your next stay when coming to Harlingen/San Benito or anywhere else in the RGV you won’t be disappointed!"

I found the bedroom area cool with AC but the bathroom and dining area (open to bedroom) were kind of stuffy and needed a fan or way to circulate air at least for me, but it may not be a problem for others. Great accommodations and owners are great as well. I will definitely be back."

If small lights bother you while you are trying to fall asleep I’d bring a sleep mask. Also possibly a possibly a a family with a dog that stayed there before us, could smell an animal as soon as you walk in (not a big deal, it went away after a while). Other than that, great little place. No big issues ."

Stayed a few nights","Annette and Patrick’s suite is as cute as a button. The bed was like a cloud and the AC cooled the space well. The host thought of all the details and created the perfect vibe — cozy, comfy, practical, and stylish. Would stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","Loved loved loved this airbnb! It was easy to locate, it was quiet and cozy as well. It had everything we needed and even allowed pets! Most airbnbs that allow pets aren't the nicest but this one was perfect! The host was very responsive and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again if it is available. 10/10 would recommend!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful place! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT!!! I had arrived earlier then expected and they well very nice to let me check in early after a very long trip:) Such a peaceful, clean, beautiful place, didn’t even want to leave! My fiancé had forgotten an expensive earring and Annette and Patrick were so nice to reach out to us that we had forgotten it, if it wasn’t for them we wouldn’t know we left it behind!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved staying here! I was very impressed with how they utilized the space. There was a place to eat, sit and read or talk in, and closet space as well as plenty of room to get ready for an event. I would definitely stay here again. It was much more like home than a hotel room but still not a whole house. Perfect for a quick getaway."

Stayed a few nights","This place is like paradise waking up to all kinds of exotic birds. I couldn't wait to wake up and run outside every morning. They are even in the palm trees! The place was beautiful! Annette and Patrick are the best at being kind and helpful. They are the best! The place is very central and close to everything, though your room will be clean and quiet."
