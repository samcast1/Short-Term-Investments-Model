Stayed one night","The stay with Deanne is very good and quiet. I feel safe and rest on this beautiful place. The room comes with everything you need and the vectors super quiet and invites you to walk, enjoy nature, and capture beautiful photographs. Just a few meters from the river, which has an area to walk or just sit and delight in the mountain magician. It is my second visit to this beautiful place and hopefully I will return again since it is located a few minutes from Wenatchee and in a short time you can also enjoy a day in"

Stayed a few nights","The property was pristine beautiful lots of flowers grass and small orchard good views and Deanna’s family was very nice. Unfortunately there was no internet or wifi upon arrival due to a recent provider change. Deanna did try to resolve the wifi issue. I’m sure this will be fixed for future guests it was just bad timing. The accommodation was comfortable good ac and fan to keep it cool when needed. No kitchen as advertised set up was basic like a hotel room with small microwave, small bar fridge and coffee pods /kettle. Paper plates. The bed was comfy and had nice linens. Bathroom/shower was spacious. I liked the location being only a few minutes down highway from shops etc however this property overlooks the highway and traffic noise was constant. There is also a fairly busy road in back of property. Overall I enjoyed my stay in Wenatchee and was decent for two nights."

Stayed a few nights","Good value for a weekend getaway. I’m use to a few more amenities like plates, silverware and napkins but we did manage to get these from the restaurant when we ordered takeout. The room was clean and there is a sitting area outside with a nice view of the orchard. Very quiet and relaxing. One note there are baseball fields that start games very early so don’t leave the window open during game season. 😊"

The area is quiet with beautiful views of the mountains and Columbia River. The space was super clean and cute inside with a comfy bed and lots of bedding and linens. The bathroom was spotless with lots of drawer/cupboard space to store stuff. The designated parking space and private entrance make this a perfect little hideaway to return home after exploring Wenatchee. It’s wonderfully located close enough to restaurants and downtown but away from everything as well. Take advantage of Hydro Park for a great walk or jog along the Columbia. Everything about staying here was easy thanks to the wonderful host. I’ll definitely be back!!

We had a one year old with us who's pack and play fit well in the room. We liked that there are no shared walls, so if she fussed there was no stress. When asked for recommendations for places to eat in town, Deanne was ready with them. It was great that we had our own assigned parking space, and the neighborhood feels very safe. The view from the bedroom window was incredible. The drive from the main area to get there, no problems. If we ski mission ridge again, we would book this again!"

Stayed about a week","Nice little spot to stay. It is in East Wenatchee a bit south of all the businesses. Access to the highway that leads into town is very quick and easy. The room itself is designed for one guest or a couple. It is equipped with a queen size bed, a small table and two chairs. There is a microwave and a mini fridge, but otherwise, no kitchen. It is modern and clean and off the road a bit, so parking is semi-private. The window looks out onto some mature cherry trees, but unless you go outside, there is no real view. Outside, there are a couple chairs you can sit on for your morning coffee. From there you can get a small view of the hills to the west and a little piece of the river. The hosts were very responsive and friendly. We would rent there again if and when we return."

Deanne was so courteous to allow a later check-out. I got to take my time exploring the trails because she let me stay a little longer. ☺️
The drive from and back to Seattle was gorgeous this early May. I can’t imagine how much more beautiful the orchards will be once the blossoms and fruit come in! And gosh, any drive through the mountains (weather permitting) is heaven.
Thank you Deanne for allowing me this weekend to rest and recoup!"

Stayed with kids","Nice semi secluded location, great price. My 1 night stay was very comfortable. This is a small studio but cozy and neat. The only things I would suggest would be to add a curtain for the restroom window as another person suggested. There is a house directly across the bathroom window and if you have your light on at night, they get a straight view into the bathroom as well as right to your bed if the bathroom door is left open. It could also be a bit cleanlier, as there was a spider greeting me as soon as I walked in, as well as spider webs along the bathroom door corners. Other than that, this is a nice value for the money and a great location. It’s definitely a cozy and quiet stay. Would recommend."

We're guessing a previous guest smoked during their stay and the smell of smoke was overpowering despite air fresheners and an air purifier. Given the cold temperature outside, airing the place out wasn't really much of an option, so we decided to just deal with the smell. Other than that, the place was great. I would have also appreciated a heads up about the smoke smell prior to our checkin though."

The attention to detail in the restoration is evident, and it made my stay feel both unique and nostalgic.
From the moment I stepped in, the cleanliness of the place stood out. It’s clear that Brett goes above and beyond to ensure the space is spotless and inviting. The house was equipped with all the amenities one could need, making it feel like a home away from home.
Brett as a host was amazing. His friendly demeanor and eagerness to ensure my stay was comfortable made a significant difference.
In summary, this Airbnb is a gem that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean, and unique place to stay. Brett has done an outstanding job with the house, and his hospitality is unmatched. A 5-star experience through and through!"

Beds are comfortable and shower is nice and spacious! Living room area has a comfortable couch and a nice open area.
Brett is also super communicative - didn’t have a problem at all during our stay! Would come here again!"

The location right across the street from a great little park made it easy to get out with the kids and let out any urgent wiggles.
Literally just a 5 min drive or 10-15 min walk from groceries, restaurants, etc. If that's not your thing then the kitchen had amazing cookware and appliances to get the job done. Couldn't have asked for more!"

Stayed a few nights","Brett was very friendly and welcomed us with provided coffee and A/C units in each room for comfort which was greatly appreciated (even though we had colder weather than we anticipated). The house is cute and we had a nice stay. They had clearly vacuumed though it didn’t seem as clean as I expected. There were crumbs and old drips of things from other people on the kitchen floor. They had air fresheners but they got to be too strong. After taking a couple air fresheners out we immediately smelled dog on the carpet and couch and plugged them back in. Not much by way of kitchen pantry supplies, so if you’re looking to cook, bring or buy your own. Luckily there is a grocery store very close by. The beds were firm, but I thought mine was quite comfy and they had several pillows to use. When I booked, I guess I didn’t realize they lived below, so waking up to them making noises (seemed like closing drawers/doors kinda loudly) was a little disappointing. I’m sure they heard us too though."

We didn't do any cooking but we used the fridge and microwave and all was well. The living/dining room area was comfortable. The individual AC units worked well on two very hot days. The bathroom was nicely done with a really nice shower. The beds in both downstairs bedrooms were really comfortable. We even enjoyed sitting on the chairs on the front porch. We weren't there much as we were in town to visit family, but would choose to stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","The Pros:
*It is close to Mission Ridge Ski Area.
*The beds were comfortable, the heat worked well, it had tall ceilings, and feels spacious.
*Check-in and check-out were easy.
The Cons:
*The oven doesn't work. It is damaged so that it only offers ""stay warm"" and ""convection"" ... the convection doesn't heat to the appropriate temp and only cooks to warm, not hot. We had to use the microwave to finish heating our meal that was designed to bake. The reason we use Airbnb vs a hotel room is so that we can cook our meals when we are done skiing. The control panel of the oven is clearly damaged, there is no way that the host doesn't know it's melted and doesn't work.
*limited comfortable furniture to kick back and watch a movie. One couch and chair are comfortable, the other two chairs are not as comfortable.
*The living room TV is small, only 40"", and difficult to watch a movie as a family
The description is not accurate, it was disappointing to discover the oven wasn't working."

There were some small things that were broken/missing in the apartment due to others who had stayed before us and had not let the hosts know. They responded when we reached out about the missing light bulb, broken blinds, etc.
The house is beautiful and well decorated, with a very comfortable bunk bed. We loved the location, close to Mission Ridge and thought they were kind and considerate hosts. The house has all that you need (kitchen stuff for cooking, coffee maker, etc.) and was cute and comfortable. We would stay here again!"

Cassy provided toys for my kids and made sure to communicate promptly when we needed something. She was super friendly and made us feel at home.
There were a few times we could hear heavy foot traffic above our unit, but as soon as I mentioned something, it was addressed. We would gladly return here in the future. Amazing airbnb!"

It was a bit of a tight squeeze in that room but worked fine for a short stay. The place was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well outfitted. The views from the living room were amazing. Just wish it had been warmer outside so we could have hung out on the patio!"

Cuddling up around the fire pit at night or waking up to a glorious morning with the sun shining through the windows and reflecting off the mirrored wall were unexpected pleasures. The kitchen has everything you need and there are lots of little extras tucked away—more than can be described. What an amazing place with great hosts.

Stayed a few nights","My husband & I stayed here for two nights of concerts at The Gorge Amphitheatre. (It's 45-75 minutes away, depending on traffic, in case you're wondering.) While the instructions to get there are pretty clear, I would highly suggest arriving during daylight hours so that you've done the drive at least once before you try to navigate it in the dark.
I was hesitant to stay in a place where the host is on-site, but I never once saw them. Their cute dog came to visit a few times during our morning grounding sessions in the grass & coffee on the patio. . .& we could hear them upstairs at times, but nothing obtrusive.
We unfortunately missed sunrise & sunset from the patio, but I imagine it would be gorgeous. It's peaceful & serene. . .& you can even hear cows mooing on the hillside.
Unit description & pictures are accurate. Good communication with the hosts. . .& easy peasy check-in & check-out procedures."

We ended up wishing we stayed longer simply to just enjoy the air bnb, and the view/outdoor patio space. Really recommend giving yourself at least one full evening to enjoy the sunset and fire table at night.

We were a bit concerned about noise because the host lives upstairs but it was an issue all. We barely heard anything the entire that we were there.

Stayed a few nights","Cassy and Jason’s place is great for a little getaway in the area. It’s not far from the heart of Wenatchee, but tucked into the foothills for that out of town feel. The views are amazing, and you’ll love relaxing on the outdoor patio. A little fire pit table, some relaxing seating, picnic table and bbq. We really enjoyed having breakfast out there in the mornings.
Wifi was good, and easy to log into. Kitchen was well equipped. Beds were comfortable. The owners actually live upstairs (but we hardly heard them at all), and their adorable dog came down a few times to visit us. Probably my daughter’s favorite part, being a puppy lover. 🐶 It’s about 35 minutes to Leavenworth, but a beautiful drive with several fun stops along the way (be sure to check out the Aplets and Cotlets candy factory in Cashmere). It was perfect for our Girls getaway. We definitely recommend this place. Thanks for hosting us Cassy and Jason!"

Heather was very responsive and helpful!
The kitchen has salt and pepper, as well as some Keurig pods and coffee filters—so be sure to plan accordingly.
The mattress is very soft, so would not work well for those needing something firm (just a head’s up).
Would recommend this property and Heather, for sure!"

But I was able to see some wild animals passing through. The house has a lot of country style decorations which personally I like a lot. There is a garden is right outside of kitchen with running fountain, little pond with fish, growing vegetables/fruits, and blooming flowers. I enjoyed sitting in the backyard for the entire afternoon with some fresh grapes. Yes, Heidi offered fresh fruits for her guests and they were so delicious since they were just picked from farm. Although I cannot use the kitchen or living-room but that didn’t bother me much. Maybe my time is right. Flower is blooming. Pears are ripe. Weather is gorgeous. Cats are friendly. Wish life is always beautiful like that."

Stayed a few nights","The Stoller ranch is a nature paradise in a beautiful wooden house built by Martin, the husband of heidi. You will have excellent views a private small waterflow, and a cozy place in made by excellent quality wood. Heidi is a really friendly and lovely person, and I like too the initiative and work of Martin to build a so lovely place. You have a big ranch to walk and see the views and the animals. In the night the stars are bright and the morning is bright and silent. Enjoy a coffee in front of the valley is a lovely experience. High roof tops. and EXCELLENT HOSTS. They are people you like.!! The room was small but i lke this kind of places, so i enjoyed also the room, and was like announced. The price was very good, and the only thing is that is a little retired from Town, so you are in the mountain. A little isolated, can be good for some people, and not so good for people who like shopping and towns. In my case I love Stoller Ranch!! I will repeat if I can!"

Little Eiger is absolutely perfect for the solo traveler. I only stayed for 3 days but easily could have done 30.
Heidi provided assorted breakfast foods and coffee which were delightful in the morning and very much appreciated.

Heidi's hospitality shines, complete with the delightful company of three friendly cats. Despite its size, the room is cozy, well-equipped, and reasonably priced for solo travelers. The spacious bathroom and relaxing hammock in the garden add to the charm. A few minor improvements could be the room's window facing the occasionally busy backyard, and Martin's less enthusiastic demeanor towards guests. Nonetheless, this tranquil haven is ideal for solo peace seekers. Will return and recommend. A solid 5 stars!"

Stayed one night","Great place, real cozy.. but
Can't use: Living room, kitchen
Could do better with breakfast items instead of just sugary quaker oats.
Host was nice but he came off a bit harsh when I arrived.. I'm part asian and I'm not used to barging in people's homes so I rang the doorbell and he came down and the first thing he said was ""did you not read the instructions?"" (or maybe that's just the way he talks coz later we talked about the farm) Anyway, I just thought that being a host - be ready to accommodate any situation or people or circumstance. Overall, my stay was good. Drove to Leavenworth to check out the German town there and came back after 9 and the place was dead quiet 🤫. I'd come back for another stay when the time is right. Thanks to the owners."

The hosts were friendly and gave helpful check-in directions that saved me from blundering around in the dark. Lots of fun cats (I was amused by trying to distinguish between them in the dark or count how many cats there were, lol). It's basically a bonus/kid's bedroom in a big mountain ranch house. Perfect place for a solo ski trip.
I didn't encounter anything pushy or uncomfortable around religion, lifestyle etc., no one brought up anything like that (just noting bc I shared some people's concerns about decorations, but it's decoration, de gustibus etc.) and the hosts were interesting and friendly to me despite me probably seeming like a crazy person because of a hectic week of work and getting up there.
May be better to ski Mission Ridge from here? Really appreciate you guys and would love to stay again."

Their home felt like a country western meets a little European inn out in the mountains, and this time of year, you can enjoy time next to the fireplace in between your activity or rest.
During my stay, I took time to tuck away for a few days here, and focus on a project I had lost focus on…and rest (do nothing)—this was a good place for me to do that.
Heidi was always there when I needed to fill my thermos with hot water to stay hydrated through my work, and shared some homemade GF cookies.

It’s a whole experience with the house, animals (you’ll be in cat heaven, fun goats, chickens; horses in the distance), views, making friends with other guests, helpful and funny hosts. It is near Leavenworth, hiking, horse riding, lakes, wineries etc.
This is a religious home, but I’d say it’s more inspirational and spiritual rather than heavy religion.
Room is tiny, a religious girl decorated, had a comfortable twin bed, desk, chair and a screen with dvd’s to watch on. Sounds of water fountain outside. Bring slippers and possibly earplugs (depends on other people staying there).

Although I left very early both mornings and never saw the hostess( she was around the 2nd evening), there are other rooms at this Airbnb, and I greatly enjoyed the couple from India who I met the 1st night, and had coffee with every morning! 😀. This is a wonderful place to stay, I'd stay here again, and I highly recommend it 😊"

Stayed one night","I was in town for my aunt's funeral. So it's not the happiest reason to be at a place. My stay was good. I received clear instructions on how to check-in. The ranch and the house were lovely. There is a pleasing view from the breakfast nook. It was a nice way to start the day. What I needed was a bed, a bathroom, and a light breakfast. That's exactly what I got, plus some added bonuses. The cats were very friendly and a joy to pet. I loved seeing the horses and goats around the property. The view out the window of Little Eiger Room is the patio with a waterfall. It's calming. The room is small, but perfect for one person. There is a single bed, a petite desk, a chest of drawers, and they have a monitor set up with movies available on it. I did not watch any movies, but it was nice to know I could. There is a shared bathroom. I was the only guest for the night, so sharing didn't come into play. As others have commented, if you are staying during snowy months, you will need a 4x4 vehicle."

Stayed a few nights","I'm so thankful that I ended up staying here while I was working in the area! While I didn't get to meet Heidi in person until halfway into my stay as she was away for a few days, she was very communicative by cell phone and made herself available for any questions. In the interim, her cats were excellent hosts, as was her husband Martin. :) He is early to rise, and I was able to chat with him about life on the ranch before heading to work.
Regarding the room, it is perfect for a solo traveler with a single bed, dresser for clothes, and a desk at which to work. The wifi made it easy to get online work done, and the coffee from the coffee bar did too. Heidi made sure to add little touches throughout her home for guests, from the Keurig coffee maker, to grab and go cereal bars and oatmeal, to fresh tangelos to break your morning fast with. The shared bathroom and room were spotless, and the communal areas were very tidy.
I highly recommend staying here if you get the chance! It's a lovely retreat if you're a solo traveler looking to stay connected to the outside world but get a taste of the country, and Heidi, Martin, and their cats are solidly amazing people to get to know. Hope to see you guys again soon!"

Martin and Heidi’s Hospitality shows in that they truly care.
Loved the very personable cats as well- each have such personality - all seem like show cats- loved the animals

It could have been a lot worse since she added extra padding. I barely fit on the bed length wise since I am 5'11. It didn't bother me that much since I am used to sleeping on a shorter mattress. I loved the coffee bar. She actually had snacks and candy for her guests. She had a good selection of tea and coffee. In addition, she had hot chocolate and hot apple cider. The mini-fridge was clean and worked like a charm. The bathroom and shower were clean too. I love her cats!! She has six cats that come inside at night. Some of them are very friendly and want to be petted. The room was at a great price for the accommodations. It was a nice place to stay after working all day. I would stay there again."

Heidi is a wonderful host who is friendly and hospitable in every way. The coffee bar she provides is above and beyond. Coffee, fresh fruit, and breakfast bars and much more. She also has tons of brochures and advice for what to do around the area which is super helpful.
This room was a good size for me personally but may not be for everyone as the bed is quite small as she mentions in the listing. The bed itself was decent, but if I were to stay again for more than one night I would definitely book a different room in her house.
There's a small fridge and microwave to use in the common area, but note that there is no kitchen access so it is probably better for a shorter stay unless you plan on eating out for most meal."

The details were exceptional -- the fridge had a few treats, essential oils and diffuser was a welcome antidote to being in the car for hours and the clawfoot bathtub was immaculate with a window view of the trees and the sky. Every time we thought we needed something it was there. Traci was very kind to let us return for a last minute use of the wifi for an emergency communication we needed to make. We are grateful for the welcoming comforts she provided, her eye for detail is SUPER HOST level. BAM!"

Stayed with a pet","Very clean and private. There was nothing wrong at all with the property and the bed was very comfortable. Very cute, well maintained, and thoughtfully furnished. Quiet neighborhood and never heard anything while in the room. It was pretty private on the small deck but not 100% private.
The listing is accurate to a point. It is very cute and ""cozy"" as the title says. Not sure where the ""breakfast"" part of ""Bed and Breakfast"" was. There were 2 packets of oatmeal available so maybe that was it... It says no TV but want to make sure people know that. I missed that on the listing. Not a big deal but was expecting to be able to wind down the evening with some news.
My biggest issue was that there was NO SHOWER. The listing does not say that there was one but I assumed there was. There is only a very cute tub. I am a big boy and a tub is not feasible for me. I also can wash my hair when I am trying to rinse in water that my body stewed in. Game changer for me. NO SHOWER"

From the ""turn down"" service she provided because we were arriving very late in the evening to all the sweet touches she provided that were unexpectedly delightful, we were just delighted. We loved the large stand-alone tub, the private porch area where we enjoyed our morning coffee (it was like being in a hidden forest!), the cozy bed... it was just a darling place all around.
We went to a concert at the Gorge and drove to Wenatchee following the show -- the drive took about an hour and 15 minutes but it was worth it (and so much better than driving back to Seattle late at night!). We will definitely book again the next time we go to the Gorge or need a place to stay in Wenatchee."

There is a floor vent in front of the door that you can open or close, but we didn’t realize that until we were checking out, so the fan was a huge help for us. She had epsom salts for the bath and a wide selection of hot teas, making it such a nice spot for a getaway!"

The place was charming and I absolutely loved the path to the unit. My elderly pup seemed to enjoy himself too. He did end up needing an urgent vet stay our morning of check out and Traci was helpful with the timing of things. I’d happily stay here again. Quiet and safe new neighborhood too. And I second Wild Huckleberry. Pleasant little breakfast spot.

Stayed one night","Such a perfect little spot-- quiet, welcoming, cozy. So many welcoming touches. Sparkling lights line a sweet little path to the front door. Soft linens on the bed, delicious soap and lotion in the loo-- even a bowl of essential oils on offer so you can choose the right compliment for your mood. My pooch and I had a great sleep, then a nice morning walk around this very pretty residential neighborhood with a delicious cup of hot coffee in hand. Highly recommend for anyone needing a home away from home in Wenatchee area."

Great place for people who are planning on spending most of their time out and about and just need a place to relax and sleep. Note: per the pics, it has no shower, so a little more difficult to rinse off after hiking all day. Great for relaxing though!!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a wonderful respite away from the hustle and bustle of town but also located conveniently close. We all, including our doggie, really appreciated the many trees and plantings and the cool they provided. It was nice seeing our dog feel at home when coming into the space and finding a bed and water and a treat in her dog dishes. It felt so welcoming, very appreciated! It is lovely to look out the front door window and see sunlight filtering through the trees - but not blinding, hot light. Summers in Wenatchee can be rough! The porch faces the east and is fairly shaded. Just perfect. Just the right amount of room for the three of us: I feel that the pictures posted of the listing make it appear tinier. Kind and easy to deal with host, thank you Tracy!"

Stayed one night","Traci is the most generous and welcoming host I have experienced on Airbnb so far. She was quick to get in touch with me and so friendly, and her space is absolutely gorgeous. She provided some bath salts and bath essentials for her beautiful claw foot soaking tub, and many other thoughtful touches in the space like an oil diffuser that really make a difference when you need to recuperate from travel. The bed was very comfortable and the whole cabin had a lovely unmistakable cedar smell, truly living up to its name. It’s the perfect little getaway cabin, very quiet and secluded with a nice little porch as well to sit out on. Wifi is fast and check in was easy with a code. I like to meet my hosts when I travel and it so happened we were going to the same concert and Traci was kind enough to invite me to meet up and that really has made my stay in Wenatchee extra special as I was travelling alone. It’s rare to encounter people like her! But even if you just want a getaway and your own privacy, I highly recommend her place. I will definitely be returning."

It’s the perfect size for two - easy easy to find & wonderful central location, close-by the airport & the perfect spot to take-off and explore no matter which direction you’re headed to next! It truly feels like an oasis from the moment you arrive 🤍 I’ve never slept in a bed more comfortable with soft cool sheets & a heavy blanket. A/C makes it a comfortable place to cool off during the heat of the day! Cute little snow boot brush - that I didn’t even know what it was for - I came all the way from Alabama. You can tell the family put heart into this cabin - the aesthetic is perfect & truly a cozy hidden sanctuary with everything you could think of. Even, a claw foot bath tub with a view. You can see the little garden from the window! It felt like home away from home, but taken up a level to feel very spa like 🤍 will be back! Be sure to leave your story of your own adventures in the notebook!"

Stayed a few nights","We had tickets for a concert at the Gorge and decided to make it a weekend getaway. And Traci's place more than fit the bill: be it relaxing in the claw tooth tub with the essential oil diffuser and drinking coffee on the deck, exploring the great outdoors through her local guidebook recommendations, or the easy commute to the Gorge. We're especially grateful for the thoughtful pet accommodations. Not only is Traci's place pet friendly, but she provides a dog bed and dishes, making bringing that furry best friend along super easy. Highly recommend, would love to stay again."

The bed was comfortable, and the bathtub was much needed after a long work day. There was sparkling water in the fridge which I appreciated, and the whole house was surrounded by trees which felt private."

It was so handy to have a spacious mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. Traci does a great job setting everything up for guests! Check-in was simple, and she’s very responsive. I’m sure its a plus for many travelers that she accommodates pups. We could hear her own through the door on a few occasions, but that’s understandable. We had some friendly kitties greet us in her front yard, as well, which for us was an unexpected plus. Great location, great accommodation, great host!"

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful space you have created, Traci.
Sometimes AirBnB stays are in a place that feels a bit run-down; not so here. This felt like staying in the guest bedroom of a very nice home, complete with beautiful art and tasteful decor. The absolutely decedent bathroom was a delight, with a soaking tub and extra-plush towels. Loved her iron tree branch sculptures, and all the little touches she put into the room. Excellent hospitality.
The one thing I will note is, I failed to notice there isn't actually a shower. I was in town for work and it was very hot (July) - normally I would take a quick shower but that was not an option, and it felt a little wasteful to fill the big tub during a drought unless I was going to use it. All in all that was very minor thing and I made do - and the flip side is, I did take full advantage of the tub, too, when I had time to enjoy it! At the end of a long day, a nice soak felt so great!
The tranquil back patio and the gorgeously landscaped property felt secluded and private - like being in my own forest retreat, with lit trails through the trees. A+, would definitely stay here again."

Her warm welcome and genuine interest in making my stay comfortable were evident from the get-go. She took the time to show me around the room, explaining every detail and ensuring that I felt at ease.
The accommodation itself exceeded all expectations. The property is tastefully decorated, striking a perfect balance between modern elegance and cozy charm. The attention to design and functionality was impressive, creating an inviting and comfortable atmosphere. The cleanliness of the space was impeccable.
Finally, the highlight of my stay was the wonderful, meaningful conversation with Dawn along with her delicious hearty breakfast —such a delightful and unexpected touch. Highly recommend this host for a fantastic and welcoming experience!

She also spent time with us while having breakfast and liked to know her guests. Bed was super comfy, especially after long hikes. The best part was Dawn provided color safe shampoo and conditioner along with all other amenities. She took care of small things. The place had everything one would need for a comfortable stay.

Even made a stop to grab some food as we hadn't eaten all day! We can't thank you enough and you made this situation we found ourselves in so much easier to handle. We can't wait to see you in the future and under easier circumstances!

My favorite part was the breakfast with Dawn as she went above and beyond to make us a nice breakfast and I loved visiting with her about our trip, life experiences and getting to know her. Dawn was very knowledgeable about the area and had some great hikes to recommend. Overall, the stay was fantastic and if I'm ever near Wenatchee I'd love to stay here again."

Your host, Dawn, clearly makes an effort to ensure her guests have a comfortable stay. We had a nice conversation over a tasty breakfast, too. A short distance away from the property is the trailhead for a worthwhile hike in the Wenatchee Foothills, if that's your thing. A short, steep trail leads to the top of Saddle Rock where you'll enjoy a commanding view of Wenatchee."

Continental breakfast was coffee, granola, yogurt, bagels and some extras. I'm sure this varies a bit guest to guest. Dawn was very kind and welcoming and it was very comfortable sharing her home. She welcomed us and showed us our room and the next morning we talked over breakfast. We had a shelf on the refrigerator and used her microwave and toaster and her dryer to dry some ski clothes. Highly recommend!"

We were running late for our checking in, ended up getting there around 10:30-10:45 pm. Rachael responded our heads-up quickly and made sure we can check in smoothly.
We had peaceful rest and enjoyed for staying this place.
There are goat milk soap for us during stay. The soap is soft, gentle smell and has silky bubbles. I loved it.
We would love to stay the place again when we will be in the town also we highly recommend."

I arrived late that evening and was in awe after I looked at the place. The place looks exactly as described. It was close to the venue that I visited along with several other places. After I arrived, I went to the bathroom to change clothes and I immediately felt warmth beneath my feet. It was cold outside and this felt soooo good. The bathroom floors are heated which is great. There is a magnifying makeup mirror which would have been very beneficial to me had I dressed at Rachels place. This was the first place I stayed at that didn't have white towel which I really appreciate. She had soap made from goat milk which made skin soft. The bed was so comfortable that I removed the sheets to see the brand. The carpet was so soft. I could have stayed there forever. I highly recommended her place."

Stayed with kids","My teenage son and I stayed here while visiting local family. Rachael was an excellent communicator - I had several questions and she always responded very quickly and helpfully. The house was easy to find, and we had a code to get in through a private entry. Even my son said “wow this is really nice!” when we opened the door to the space. It was like a cool studio apartment. There was a little electric fireplace and a small kitchen with a fridge, cooktop, microwave/convection oven, and Keurig coffee maker with a ton of options (including cocoa). We really appreciated the snacks and enjoyed playing board games. There were so many nice little touches and even a portable crib for folks traveling with a smaller kiddo. We had forgotten something so we needed to run to the store and there was a WinCo within a half mile or so - we walked there after dark and felt very safe.
All in all just a great visit and we will definitely stay here again if we need a place in Wenatchee!"

Stayed with kids","My two sons (10 and 13) and I thorouhly enjoyed our stay! We all loved the spa-like bathroom! It's what I would describe as very sensory-friendly for anybody with special needs (ASD, anxeity). It's clean, lighting can be adjusted (sliders to turn down brightness), and it has a private entrance. The hostess went out of her way to make the apt. feel like home, with personalizations and treats. Kids enjoyed the snack bars, I enjoyed the goat-milk soap!
I also think this location is especially nice for North Wenatchee - the senior center is around the corner and beyond that is a school field, so any sports enthusiasts or joggers would love having a soccer/baseball field ""right there"". I totally felt safe having my kids walk around in the neighborhood by themselves. They could go down Maple (there are sidewalks) and walk around/across the sportsfield during daylight hours.
Thanks, Rachael! We'll be back."

I didn't want to leave, I absolutely love this place. walkable distance to multiple stores. not far from town at all. I highly recommend Rachel's listing to anyone. I cannot say enough good things about this rental. Rachel States that she apologizes for any possible noises from upstairs, which is where she and her family live, but actually I think my aunt and myself were probably louder (laughing) than any of the noise I sort of heard from upstairs. I am hoping I didn't disturb her. neighborhood was wonderful, clean, and I felt very safe in this area. lots of nice little personal touches.

The location worked incredibly well for me. I was doing the move in process for an apartment nearby and shopping for essentials for it and could do that without getting bogged down in construction traffic or even really leaving the side the streets. It was perfect.
I had a great experience staying here."

It was so spacious, so homey and had fun amenities such as heated bathroom floors! The place was so clean you could still see the vacuum marks in the carpet! She went above and beyond and had 2 waters for us chilling in the fridge along with a sweet welcome note and clear instructions for any questions. Thanks for being such a thoughtful host."

Transcend from 85 outdoor temp to a cool air conditioned environment of 72. Snacks on counter, bottled water in fridge and low and behold ice cream treats in the freezer. Well appointed interior dining table, small desk unit, couch with two recliners, a bathroom to die for which had a heated floor and a comfy king size bed for a great night of pleasant dreams. One of our better stays with Airbnb."

Stayed with kids","Rachael has created a beautiful space out of her basement. The bathroom is especially modern, warm and luxuriously spacious. The only reason for our 4-star rating is that it was listed as a 1 bedroom but it is actually a studio. Only the bathroom has a separate space. We travel with our young child and having a separate bedroom for her to fall asleep in allows us to have some time to watch tv, play a game and/or just hang out and talk. Instead, staying in a studio means we have to go to bed when she does and all rise together. It was probably good for us to get the added rest, but we definitely thought we were booking something different and were disappointed by the inaccuracy. Highly recommend this space for a solo individual or a couple, though, if you happen to be staying in Wenatchee. Otherwise, it was lovely and the keyless entry allows you to check-in without needing to coordinate a meetup and the design of the space never makes you feel like you are staying below someone’s home."

Stayed one night","Decent stay for the price if you’re going to visit Leavenworth! The room is nice and clean, but the basement in general is pretty disorganized. Seems like there’s only 1 bathroom for shared, so there’s a lot of stuff in there. Have to navigate steep stairs to go down to the room."

Stayed one night","Great adorable basement bedroom, with adorable little touches. Comfy bed. Great space for 2 adults. Super friendly dog Molly, and sweet cat that wanders around. Very Private. The bathroom is upstairs (which was fine for us), but please note that you have to go up & down steep basement stairs to the bathroom.
Location is great, about 5 min drive to downtown Wenatchee. Easy to find! And great parking in the driveway.
Highly recommend! Would stay again!"

FYI- There was a cat in the home, in addition to Molly, the dog. The cat was skittish, and Molly was very friendly and quieter than Rachael states in her blurb."

Stayed one night","Staying at Rachael and Charlie's house was an amazing experience. I only saw Charlie and Molly (their dog) and during that time Charlie gave me some good local tips and drove me to the airport at 5 AM! I asked if there was a taxi service I could use, and he seemed to know that it wouldn't be possible so he offered to drive me with Molly! His hospitality was a highlight of my trip to Washington. I felt more than welcome and would absolutely suggest this stay to tired travelers. (They also offered some nice handmade sample soaps/lotions for washing) I'd take this over a hotel any day!"
