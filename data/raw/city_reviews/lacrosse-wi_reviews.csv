Stayed a few nights","Michael was super responsive and helpful. The place was very clean. And check if was simple and convenient. They provided some special extras like wine and snacks, which was a special touch.
He went out of his way to recommend fishing spots, unfortunately the weather didn’t cooperated.
The only downside was the living room isn’t super comfortable if you decide to just hang out with guests but that wouldn’t be enough of a downside for us not to stay again.
It was perfect for us as the parents of a college student to stay and even have kids over for dinner. I think it would be awesome to stay in warmer weather to fish in the backyard.
Thank you Michael for a memorable visit!"

Stayed a few nights","I grew up in that part of Wisconsin, so I have my own haunts. This Airbnb is in a lovely location and convenient to both LaCrosse and Onalaska. Go to Red Pines for a walleye dinner, enjoy (in the summer months) Moon Tunes in LaCrosse’s Riverside Park, take a boat ride on a paddle steamer (from Riverside Park). Definitely drive up Grandad Bluff to see the view of LaCrosse, the Mississippi River and Minnesota on the other side of the river."

Stayed with kids","What a fantastic stay! Michael and Lyn were such gracious and incredible hosts and it was a pleasure to stay in their place. It has a gorgeous view of the Mississippi River backwaters and is very close to restaurants and the dock where we were fishing out of for the national high school fishing tournament. There was a great place to park our bass boat and truck and we slept great each night. The added touch of the charcuterie board and sodas was a wonderful addition and personal touch. I also really enjoyed chatting with Mike and Lyn at nights. They were very considerate and gave us our space, and we’re very engaging and fun to talk to once they realized I wanted to chat. I would definitely stay at the Red House again. Absolute 10/10! Thank you again Mike and Lyn!!"

The location is right on the Mississippi and there is so much wildlife to see right from your back door. Michael and his wife were so friendly and welcoming. They made the little apartment feel like a home

Stayed a few nights","Perfect place to stay! While not on the river per se, the back deck with the water view was the perfect retreat from a hard day at work or morning coffee. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed for our week. The wine and snacks were a welcome treat on our first night as were the bottles of water in the fridge. The selection of coffee was excellent. There's a closet full of cleaning supplies which made the stay much tidier. Michael also made sure we had good directions to the house due to some unexpected construction the week of our stay."

Stayed a few nights","The Redhouse was a perfect spot for a few days of biking and hiking in La Crosse. The full kitchen was very useful, and the whole place was comfortable (including a nice, firm bed). The host left us a bottle of wine and some local seltzer.We particularly liked the small backyard seating area, overlooking Mississippi River backwaters. The location worked for us - in a quiet area but within 15-20 minutes of everything we needed. Communication before and during our stay was speedy and helpful.
I would not hesitate to book here again."

It was a very quiet, peaceful location adjacent to the National Bird Sanctuary, but was also minutes from many great restaurants with outdoor seating and other attractions. If you love the great outdoors and you’re looking for a great place in La Crosse that is safe, clean quiet and comfy, this is it. We highly recommend the Red House and would definitely stay here again if come back to the area."

The river and view in the back of the house from the patio is amazing. Michael is on the next level as a host and went above and beyond to ensure that myself and my fishing partner had a comfortable stay. He is truly a stand up person. From the cleanliness and provided amenities to the view out the back doors and windows, this house is perfect.
The house is close enough to local attractions, yet secluded enough to give a person privacy."

Stayed a few nights",This was a very comfortable and enjoyable location. Visiting the daughter and grandkids and it was a great place to sit and talk and play games. It is convenient to every thing in this charming town. Felt very safe in the neighborhood. We had a surprise snowfall and cold temps but the house was very comfortably heated. Good WiFi and kitchen and bathroom had all necessities. So great to have a pets-allowed option and there were no smells from previous fur guests 😊. I was concerned with the possibility of noise from the upstairs unit from earlier posts but never had any issues. Scott was very easy to communicate with and got back to me immediately with any requests or concerns. Would definitely stay again.

We loved his smaller place (upstairs) and love this one even more! This will be our first choice for future stays. The only drawback is the proximity to the railroad tracks. The train does NOT sound the horn, so it is quiet, but we got stuck at the crossing many times because the train was being moved back and forth multiple times per day. It was a small inconvenience, though, for a super AirBNB!"

Really great host and the place was just like his description and photos. We were very comfortable there; three adults and a 30 pound dog - plenty of room for all of us and all the amenities (even more) we needed. The screened front porch was where we spent most of our time, even preferring to just hang out comfortably there instead of running around a lot! Cute and diverse neighborhood, which made dog walking even more fun as we met a few folks and friendly dogs throughout throughout the local area. Seriously, we can hardly wait to come back and hope to do so sometime before the snow flies this year. This place is NOT a Hilton...it is relaxed and homey, and in our opinion, way better!"

The stay here made us so comfortable we'd like to come back to Lacrosse and explore more of what it has to offer as we feel that we could have a great day out and then return to a comfortable and welcoming home!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place! exactly like the pictures and description. very comfy beds and linens. perfect location for our stay as it was close to everi we need. The neighborhood isn't the greatest but the house is nice. Great back yard for the dog. I will say if people are upstairs you can hear the floor creaking and their walking around no matter how quiet they try to be. and you can hear the TV up there and then talking even if just normal, as there is an apt. upstairs too....but we would stay again for sure and recommend it as it was a very nice place and we felt right at home...."

Stayed with a pet","We were so happy to find a place that allowed our dog and Scott even had dog bowls for us to use! The house is in an easy to find location that is close to the heart of La Crosse and UWL. There are railroad tracks 2 blocks away, but the place is well insulated with good windows, which kept the noise out. Quiet neighborhood with a convenience store and neighborhood bar within a few blocks. The beds were comfortable to sleep on as well. I recommend this place whether you have a pet or not. We will likely stay here again in the future."

Nice features and hospitality throughout the house, including good quality bed and bath linens, and kitchen appliances and amenities. Access to house was secure but easy to navigate with the emailed instructions. Pleasant and helpful communication with the host from the time of booking through to and after checking out. I am immensely pleased to find a nice, clean, smoke-free place that would allow me to bring my dog. Staying alone in unfamiliar places is stressful without my dog's company! The wonderful fenced back yard is an added bonus for both of us. I stayed in the winter and didn't hear the trains on the tracks a few blocks away. It snowed one night but the city was prompt with clearing the streets, so no problems getting around. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting La Crosse."

The fenced in backyard was secure for our pups to do their business. Easy access to grocery stores for the multi-day stay.

Two of our friends and I just needed a quiet, clean, and comfortable place to stay for a long weekend, and Scott’s AirBNB was the perfect refuge. The house was a perfect location, not far from Onalaska where funeral services were, but also close to downtown La Crosse for shopping and dining. We also appreciated that Scott had written out in the dining room a variety of recommendations for restaurants and daily deals on dining. We didn’t need much, but we very much appreciated Scott for getting back to us quickly when we had any concerns."

It snowed twice during our three day stay and both times he was there clearing and salting before the snow had even stopped. And the beds! The beds are the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in at an Airbnb.

His place has fast WiFi (we both had zoom calls for work and the video connection was no problem), is nicely decorated, beds are very comfy, and Scott left some tasty snacks out :) the backyard is big and our dog loved it.

It is great to come back after a day out and curl up on the comfy sofa with a cocktail and watch Netflix that Scott set up for his guests. I travel with my hound and cat and Scott welcomed them....a very rare find! There is a nice fenced in back yard, a wonderful amenity for me and my hound. If it were summer I would be grilling on the Weber. Scott has bern an attentive, gracious and helpful host. We have been happy and content here, so much so that I have extended twice! Thanks Scott!"

La Crosse for a fall weekend and the home was cozy and perfect for us to use as a place of respite after a day of running around. Although the weather had turned cold and we didn’t
spend time around the fire pit or on the dock,
the home was uniquely situated on the shores of the Mississippi and it was neat to see the water traffic.
Had we been here when it was warmer, we would have enjoyed the outdoor amenities as well. Although the home is in a well-populated area of the city, it was quiet and peaceful."

Clean, modern, and quiet with a private dock situated between the shore of the river and a wildlife preserve; we couldn't have asked for more as tourists visting LaCrosse on a whim. We truly lucked-out, and will consider booking a longer stay with this little gem as our main vacation goal.
Also, we visisted during 100+ dehree temperatures and still managed to catcu a few fish (the air conditioning in the cabin kept it as cool as we wanted in between casts). Becky provided plenty of information about local amenities, and a coupon for a great little bar and grill down the street. Loved it 100%!"

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely perfect!! The cabin was just what my husband, dog and I needed for a weekend away. We've been to La Crosse a few times before but never afforded to stay on the Mississippi - the view was amazing and we had the whole dock to ourselves to fish. The kitchen has so many utensils and dishes and even snacks left on the counter. TV worked great as well as WiFi. There were many flyers and menus left on the kitchen table which was much appreciated.
There is a hair dryer available to use in the bathroom. Water pressure is good. Lots of towels available as well as extra toilet paper. There are ice cube trays in the freezer and a container to keep ice cubes in if needed. All of the light switches are labeled so you can easily identify what the switch is for. There are ceiling fans in each room which is nice. Air conditioner worked excellent and is so quiet which is a plus!
Lots of extra blankets and pillows if needed. Bed is comfortable. Loved the view from the table"

I loved all the beautiful landscaping.
The host was so helpful and always responded quickly to any questions we had. She also recommended a few restaurants, which was appreciated. I also liked that she was so kind when we crossed paths after we did the self check in.
It was a little mini honeymoon for us and we were so glad to be able to get away and enjoy being right on the water at such a cool spot!

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed this serene and peaceful place. I could tell they had just updated it. It’s very well done, it doesn’t seem like you’re in a small of a place as you are. Plus you are right on the river! The only suggestion I have is the plastic on the mattress makes you hot while you sleep."

Stayed a few nights","**Review for Andy**
My stay at Andy's Airbnb was truly exceptional. From the moment I arrived, Andy went above and beyond to ensure I felt welcome and comfortable. The house was immaculate, beautifully decorated, and equipped with all the amenities I needed for a perfect stay. The location was ideal, offering a peaceful retreat while still being close to local attractions and conveniences.
Andy was an outstanding host, always responsive and willing to help with any questions or requests. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout the home, which made my stay feel extra special.
Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I highly recommend Andy's place to anyone looking for a top-notch Airbnb stay. Thank you, Andy, for your hospitality!"

A fully furnished kitchen with every utensil you could hope for. The location is extremely convenient to get anywhere. Andy was very easy to communicate with and responded back to us extremely quickly. We would book again any time we're in the area. 10 out of 10 stay!!!

Stayed one night","Andrew's place was great! Everything was as stated in his description. We had a very relaxing time. Although it was 100+ outside, the window air conditioners and ceiling fans kept it very pleasant. The beds were comfortable and my daughter- in- law commented on how soft the sheets were. (I agree!). We were back and forth to an event in Onalaska, which was only about 15 minutes away, and Andrew's location made it an easy trip across town. We wish the weather wouldn't have been so hot, as we would have loved to have walked around Lacrosse and down by the Mississippi. We plan on possibly making another trip up to Lacrosse in the fall and will definitely be checking to see if we can stay at Andrew's again."

We only stayed one night so didn’t use the kitchen except for the coffee (provided also) but for a longer stay, it looked well stocked and ready to use. Bedrooms were comfy and clean and even had a sunny and bright workspace for those who need it. The house is old but has been well updated and couldn’t find a a squeaky floor, leaky window or any indication of its age - even the outside staircase is solid and well maintained. Shower pressure better than mine at home and bath towels bright white and soft. Thank you Andy for providing such a comfy spot for us to stay while visiting our daughter. We will be back!"

Andrew is super friendly and communicative -- I could tell I was chatting with a genuine person who was interested in my well-being. Would definitely stay here again. We got a discount for having a long stay (not sure if that's set up by the host or by AirBnB itself) but even before the discount, this was so affordable for a really nice place!"

The host Andrew is truly spectacular. He cares about his guest and it shows from the cleanliness of apartment and his overall greeting and response to his customer.

We loved getting to relax staring out all the windows at any critters near by (saw some deer and bunnies) and the stars at night. 10/10 would recommend and we will be back!"

The fire pit was a nice bonus too on a cool evening! Only complaint was that the temp was quite cold in the house overnight. The temperature was set at 67 but the inside temp was around 60 at night. Overall a very positive experience though and would stay again, maybe in the fall when the leaves are colored!"

Stayed one night","Kindred Tiny Home is a unique and LOVELY place to stay.
The design of the home with its many windows would definitely benefit from a more private location where the blinds could be open all around and you could experience being “in nature”.
But it was nice to have the option of the lit trail to walk on at night and that same woodsy area to go to sleep seeing and then wake up to.
It took us a few minutes to find the garbage can (under the sink) and we also had to eat standing by the counter because there was no table set up. (I did see on Insta - when scrolling back to older posts - that the table used for decor may have been meant for eating on?)
I understand aesthetics and how they can add to an experience, but we would have preferred to have a table to eat at.
We certainly didn’t want to eat in the bed and risk spilling or staining the linens.
Just would’ve preferred practical over pretty.
Overall, we had a nice stay - a first for a few things so for that, we’re glad."

We hiked at Perrot State Park. The host is very accommodating and prompt with communication. Excellent location and beautiful place to stay. The tiny house is clean and decorated so nice. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is very nice and the shower is big and open. It’s a relaxing place to unplug and enjoy being in nature. We had a fire in the fire pit and enjoyed the views from the comfort of the bed. The kitchenette has a nice small fridge that was sufficient and a microwave and a coffee maker. We hired Alex from Instinct Photography to capture our engagement! He planned everything perfectly and does an incredible job. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back.

It felt great to be able to relax without any worries. Waking up to watch the sunrise with coffee in bed was a great way to wrap up our day-cation.

Driving through this area, the bluffs are so beautiful; staying a night in this tiny home, now brings to life what it’s like to live on a sort of ‘mountain.’ I had a beautiful fire going as I watched Orion move along the sky. The cute fire starters helped, as well as various types of cut wood, including kindling and dry cut logs. Cozy bed, and waking up to see the trees and trail welcomed a happy morning walk which included seeing eagles fly above. Lovely shower with soft towels. Spacious bathroom. Good coffee, great dinnerware. Bring your own fire starting source (lighter) so that you get to enjoy the beauty and peace of listening to the sparks of the fire as you watch the night sky."

Stayed a few nights","Kindred Tiny Home has been beautifully placed facing a forest. It's a peaceful setting on the outskirts of La Crosse and a great stopover for a couple of days or more when visiting the area. We normally like to have more kitchen amenities for cooking when staying in a place for a couple of days or more, but appreciated and specifically sought the simplicity of this stay and the opportunity to experience life in a tiny house. We didn't get to take advantage of the fire pit the second night because we arrived back later than planned—do yourself a favor and save time for the outdoor amenities and, more simply, time to appreciate the natural outdoor space around you. Natalie keeps the place impeccably clean and rightfully asks the same of her guests—it's a beautiful home worthy of respect. The only word of caution on that front is since you'll be taking your shoes off upon entering, be careful on the steps if you step onto the patio—they're very slippery in socks! :)"

Stayed a few nights",This was our first Airbnb experience. We were attending a funeral and my elderly mother was with us. We were so much more comfortable than if we had stayed in a motel. We did have to switch our room with the king size bed with my mom’s room with a queen because the mattress was too high for her to sit on or get into. A minor inconvenience but perhaps a step stool for older folks or short people like me (5’1”) would be helpful. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this cozy home in La Crosse.

Very new appliances and renovations to give this old home new life. Comfy furniture to relax and sleep too.
Kudos to Gabe as a fantastic host. We had contacted him when we realized the tv remote was missing and one of the other tv remotes had dead batteries. He was there in less than 30 minutes to install a universal remote and provide new batteries.
I am totally recommending this location for a LaCrosse visit and would stay here again if I’m in this part of the state."

Group trip","The mansion is gorgeous! We took our family here for one night in for an early Christmas gift. I wish we would have had time for two nights. We had six adults. The bedrooms easily accommodated our sleeping needs. Having a bathroom with each bedroom made getting ready for bed and leaving in the morning very convenient. The size of the rooms are huge! When we arrived we spread out snacks on the large kitchen island. We played games in the game/tv room and the front room by the faux fireplace. The house was within five minutes of everything we had planned: meal at four sisters, rotary lights on the Mississippi, and the Viterbo Christmas show. We made a huge breakfast in the well stocked gourmet kitchen. When we dropped our daughter back at Viterbo everyone said their favorite part of the visit was spending time together laughing at the Cargill-Pettibone Mansion. We all highly recommend this historic house. Make sure you read the history of it when you enter the home."

Group trip","We had a great stay! 4 couples stayed for Family Weekend at UW- La Crosse. Location was fantastic, right in between the university and downtown area. All of us had our own bedroom and bathroom with plenty of extra room when our boys came to visit us.
The owner was very friendly and responsive to any questions I had.
We played lawn games and board games, made meals, went on walks, and enjoyed hanging out together. The house was beautiful, clean, and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay again!"

Great front porch to visit on, perfect dining room table to gather around and the kitchen was easy to use with the 4 of us. We sat in the parlor room to visit too. Bedrooms were GREAT! Having 4 of us with our own bedroom and bathroom made it so comfortable. We were able to walk to the river and downtown restaurants which was great for us. We will be back again. Thank you Matthew!!!"

Stayed one night","We enjoyed staying overnight at the Cargill-Pettibone house! Because of the cost, for us it was a one-time bucket list sort of visit, but extremely pleasant. For extended family groups planning a family Christmas or family reunion, or UW-La Crosse alumni looking for a very comfortable shared stay, or even a business looking for accommodations for a team spending a few days in La Crosse, the cost would be acceptable. Matthew and his team have renovated and furnished the mansion impressively so far, and it will only get better! The only minor down side was street-only parking, which was not a major issue for us and our Forester."

Stayed a few nights","We've stayed at various vacation rentals in La Crosse, and this is in the top five. It is a sweet, little gem of a home that has a cozy, comfy vibe to it, plus located in central La Crosse, so easy access to downtown, etc. Very quiet neighborhood, especially at night...hardly any traffic. Manette had ALL the essentials for our stay, and she was so quick to respond to any questions I had. There is a cool back patio with a fire pit, but unfortunately due to the county burn ban--due to high winds--we weren't able to use it. Really enjoyed our stay there. Thank you again, Manette, for providing this home away from home, AND for your quick communication skills. Highly recommend this to anyone considering a visit to La Crosse!!"

Top tier communication from Manette, she messaged back almost immediately every time I messaged her. Our dogs felt so relaxed and calm in her home and the backyard was perfect for them to run around in after being cooped up in the car for 2 very long days. My only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer! We were passing through on our move from Seattle to Detroit so it was a very short stay- but if I’m ever in La Crosse again I’ll be staying here for sure!!"

Her house is a really wonderful option for a family or group of friends-a beautiful space to hang out, lots of games, a large dining table, comfy furniture and a lot of bedrooms. She is a great hostess- leaving out all those little things that you may have forgotten and waters and snacks as a welcome. Really wonderful. We bought our dog and it was fun to have an opportunity to have her with us on our vacation. Thank you. We will be back."

The kitchen and laundry can both be closed off from either or both of the bedroom/bathroom spaces, so we could do cooking, cleaning, and tea prep together or separately, too. The design is clean and simple, the colors are soothing and everywhere you turn, there is a handy hook, a shelf, or light. Highly recommended. We hiked the La Crosse Bluffs for three days in a row. Also amazing!"

This Airbnb was extremely spacious and was a nice place to stay to celebrate. This Airbnb is also in the heart of downtown, so restaurants and stores were in complete walking distance which was really nice as well, we also had our own parking space and overall found our stay very calming and cozy! Highly recommend if you need a staycation or are traveling and need a place to stay in La Crosse."

And every detail reflected a concern for our comfort and experience- the comfy bed, the plush towels, the guest book with suggestions on how to enjoy the neighborhood. It's not just somewhere to stay; it's a luxurious experience."

The space was so gorgeous. The pictures do not do it Justice. We would love to stay here again!! One of our favorite air b and b’s ever!!"

It was a 10 minute walk to Riverside Park and shorter to other restaurants and shops. The only small downside is you can hear the businesses or private residences surrounding the loft very easily. Otherwise, this loft is an incredible stay. Elizabeth was kind, flexible with our check-in and helpful!"

There were little touches and surprises that I don't want to mention because the fact that we weren't expecting them made them even more appreciated. Beautiful views of classic buildings made us feel at times like we were in a European city and the best of La Crosse was all within walking distance.
We enjoyed exploring La Crosse & the bluffs on foot and on bike. We are already talking about our next visit."

Location is right downtown and walkable to all of the main stores and restaurants - Duluth Trading is close and Cabin Coffee is right around the corner! We had great instructions, but the back alley was a little hard to find at night, but it all made sense during the daytime and once we got acclimated with our surroundings. The bedroom is huge and very comfortable. We can't say enough good things about this rental and would definitely stay again - the only thing is the very narrow, steep staircase leading up to the apartment. If you have trouble climbing stairs this may not be the place for you, but otherwise you won't find a better place in downtown La Crosse!"

It’s HUGE! You can either use the key in the glass door or take the metal steps up to the 2nd floor bedroom and use it there. I definitely recommend the metal steps, they’re easier to use. Also, the bedroom door doesn’t automatically lock, don’t forget to lock it before heading out.
After climbing either set of steps with your luggage, you can take a rest and let the ceiling fans cool you off > the dials below the thermostat.
Every room is fully stocked, just like being at home but so much more fabulous 👏 Treat yourself!!"
