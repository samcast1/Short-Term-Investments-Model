Stayed a few nights","I needed a place to stay for a week while I started a new job and found Bryan’s place - sure am glad I did. It was so cozy, had everything you could possibly need, and felt like you were at home. Bryan was super responsive and helpful with any questions I had. I would highly recommend! If I wasn’t moving to town, I would stay here any time I visit!"

Stayed with a pet","So if you want a little slice of heaven, this place is for you. Oh and the birds chipping all day long truly adds to relaxing experience. Not only the pool, the deck and the backyard stunning, the inside of the guest house is just as clean and cozy. Traveled with my two pups and they actually loved meeting Rebecca's fur babies. Didnt want to share this peace of heaven with anyone, cause i wanna be selfish and have it all to myself next time im passing by. This felt like home away from home. Thank you, guys!"

Stayed with a pet","Beware! This air BnB is not as listed, I was fooled by the photos, reviews and rating. It is not clean, smells horrible, ac unit and humidifier (which u assume is for the smell) are extremely noisy. The pool is so gross and not clean.
The photos on this air BnB are so deceiving. We had to immediately leave and check into a local hotel after driving for 10 hours. And we didn’t even get a full refund from the host."

Stayed with a pet","We did enjoy our stay and it would’ve been great to utilize the pool if it was warmer outside! Unfortunately we did have a very hard time sleeping because the AC/Heat unit on the wall, made a very loud noise the whole time we stayed. And no matter what setting we put it on, we could not get the noise to stop. We also had to login to our Hulu account on the TV because it was a smart tv. But not logged in to anything so we had to utilize our own account. Other than those couple of little inconveniences, we were happy with our stay. The place was clean and we would’ve slept well if the AC wasn’t making such loud noise lol they are very nice people and they’re very helpful/respectful."

Stayed one night","I had asked if I could come one day later and they were ok with this. I had to actually do this on ABNB. When I arrived I went to the door, and Reeves didn’t know why I was there. His wife takes care of the guests usually. That was fine, but I couldn’t figure out how to get the TV to work with the stated programs. I let them know, but I ended up just going to bed because they had prior commitments and didn’t have time to help me. Unfortunately, I think the change in arrival date, wasn’t actually convenient for them. I loved the place though. Great bed, nice kids and sweet dogs. I would go there again- in good weather so we could enjoy the pool."

We appreciated that so much! We fell asleep to the sound of crickets and woke up to birds singing. We came in late and left early in the morning, but everything was really perfect and just what we needed. Getting on I-95 S in the morning was a breeze. We will surely stay again on our next trip between Virginia and Florida! Added bonus: the fenced in pool area was great for our dogs to stretch out their legs after a long car ride (us too!)"

Most importantly Kimberly was so responsive. I made this reservation literally last minute and they were more than willing to accommodate me and ask if I needed anything throughout the stay. Fantastic hosts!!!"

I loved sitting outside and watching the trees and listening to the birds. If this is the kind of place, you enjoy, then you will love this. If you’re looking for commotion, bars, restaurants, party environment, this is not it."

Their place was clean and spacious with cool decor and a laid back vibe. The main bed and the sofa bed were both comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and filled with classic bungalows from about 100 years ago. Definitely a great flat and great hosts!

Stayed with a pet","Outstanding amenities for a night's rest. Kim and Pack went out of their way to prepare for the weary traveler. Plenty of snacks and coffee. Great bath necessities to get the the morning started. The only improvement to suggest is the bed needs something firm underneath the mattress like plywood. It sunk to the middle and made sleeping nearly impossible. The host is crafty enough, I know they can fix the bed. Definitely will stay again if our travels go through SC."

My daughter gave me a virtual tour as soon as they arrived. She was in awe of the unique refrigerator. She said the place was very clean and liked the snack selection.
The hosts were kind enough to refund us one night stay when my husband realized he only needed three nights and not four. They were also understanding that I was the go between for communication from them to my husband as he doesn't have an Airbnb account.
Husband and daughter said they would stay again!"

The sound machine was great. We both woke up at our usual 6 am time so we made coffee and went out to bench in carport to enjoy coffee, birds singing and watching nature wake up. We never heard the rooster crowing until we were outside. Loved hearing them. Great communications thru text and written instructions. Any questions we had were quickly responded to. WE WOULD DEFINITELY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT. Great experience!"

Stayed a few nights","This isn't just a clean comfortable place to stay; it has personality that shows ""above and beyond"" planning on the part of the host. We've been spoiled by some very nicely decorated places but none have had such a perfectly themed and well put together feel. The kitchen was modern where it needed to be, new glass top stove and countertops, yet the refrigerator had the theme of the house nailed. There were games, snacks, waters, cabinets with everything you'd need for a great meal. The living area had a large couch and collection of pillows for ideal comfort. Good thing because the stay that we planned ahead for, happened to be right in the middle of a semi-tropical storm. Instead of being on the go, walking and sight seeing, we spent more time than usual at home, and felt like the weather didn't interrupt our fun at all. The bathroom is spacious, spotless, and updated. Laundry area with full sized washer and dryer. Everywhere we looked, there were nice touches."

Stayed a few nights",It was great to have our own space for Thanksgiving weekend. We were able to come and go from our son's house and have our own space which was priceless. There was no way in the world we could sleep in the tall bed or be prepared for just how tall it was. Thankfully we always travel with a suitcase of linens for a queen size bed so we slept on the pull out sofa. Late the last afternoon we decided that another night on that sofa bed was more than we could take and headed for home early. We would stay again if the bed is ever changed to one we could sleep in. They do make kits to lower those old beds. We know because we have an antique pineapple post bedroom set that it works on. We have no complaints otherwise.

The lighting was a bit dim in that room, but we could see that it was completely spotless! In fact, the entire home was very clean!!! So if you have someone who requires lots of quiet, that’s their room, for sure!

We especially appreciated all the small touches like bottled water, snacks, coffee and creamer in the kitchen, fresh linens, and the extra blankets in the bedroom. The downstairs bed and half bath were definitely a bonus if you have a light sleeper or someone looking for their own quiet space in your party! It was perfect for our family trip, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to stay in a quiet spot close to everything you need in Florence. MUSC Hospital, Starbucks, grocery stores and restaurants are all less than a 5-minute trip away, and it’s also convenient to downtown and Francis Marion University. They had thought of everything, but with the small questions we did have, they were also very quick to respond and assist. Book this place! You won’t be disappointed."

The bathroom and bunks are connected without locks and offer very little privacy. The bathroom door does not even seal. So, yes, GREAT for 2 people, great area, great price."

We wanted to make our trip back to NJ a little more than just another night in a hotel and it was just about the same for a hotel room. The experience was a bonus.
We loved that we felt safe. It was nice to have game night after being on the road all day. Keyless entry was definitely a bonus. Although we didn’t have to bother Shannon, she left her number available for us to contact her along with all the information we needed to enjoy our stay. A few things I would note is that the beds in the back are for small kids, and one of the 3 dogs barked non stop all morning lol. Having a five month old, the sound didn’t bother us, actually made it feel more like home. We hope to stay with there again on our next trip.

We needed to change our night early on when our plans changed and that was flexible and easy. The day of arrival we knew we would be arriving late and reached out to Shannon who was lovely about it. She left the light on and assured us that she could accommodate us. Her communication was on point and it was so much fun to wake up and see all the animals and give the goats some treats.
The location was easy to find with great signage and easy to follow step by step instructions. If we take another car trip from NY to FL we’d definitely stay here again."

The highlight is obviously the farm itself. It was a tonic to interact with llama, goats, sheep, horses. The goats were especially sassy and entertaining. Cool looking chickens, some cats and the donkeys were also a delight. My dog kissed a donkey and my heart was full.
Shannon was super cool and helpful. We’d move in if she let us lol

Stayed with kids","Shannon’s farm stay is a little oasis a little outside of Florence. It’s hard to find dog and kid friendly stays so we were so appreciative of this stay on our way back down to Florida. Our 6 and 4 year old loved feeding the animals and Shannon ( “farmer Shannon” to our son) let them follow and help her on her nightly chores which was an added bonus after a long days drive. It was an especially hot and humid day so we didn’t get the full farm experience as we couldn’t stay outside too long, but the hour or so we did get to spend was very worth it. An amazing seafood joint (Tubbs) is a short 10 minute drive away and we spent an hour or so there hiding from the heat with the kids as well. Our two small children slept well on the bottom bunk while we shared the Queen pullout sofa and had our baby in a pack and play next to us. The farm fresh eggs served as an added treat when we arrived to help keep the kids going! Thank you Shannon!"

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Wrapping up my summer trip as the “Aunty who can” was made so much easier with your beautiful farm.
The children were so content and happy knowing we were surrounded by beautiful animals who are cared for so well. The property was well maintained and allowed us to just bask in nature.
If you are concerned about places to eat, simply download door dash and you will have multiple options to choose from. Keep in mind, farm experiences are on the weekends, so if you want a more personal experience with the animals book during the weekend.
This farm, is full of love and I will be back with my hubby and daughters for a weekend getaway soon. Thank you so much again Shannon, you made a tired Aunty/mommy feel right at home."

Stayed with a pet","This is our second time staying here and it did not disappoint. The place is clean, private, peaceful, and you have the experience of feeding the goats, sheep, and alpacas. My boys love coming for the animals and bunk beds! My in laws live nearby so the convenience of location and farm life is perfect, has become our “spot” for when we come visit!"

I'm a bigger person, and I slept great. She had a keurig with cream and farm fresh eggs in case you feel like having a snack. I felt nurtured and peaceful. Next time we're staying for a full week :)"

The minute we arrived we felt like we could relax and rest, and visiting with the sweet animals was an absolute dream. My daughters were so excited - animal therapy is a real thing and it happens here. My youngest daughter fell in love with the farm cat ""Lil Kim"", being here definitely put wind in their sails to get through the next part of our drive. So grateful to stay somewhere as unique as this gem on our trip! We will definitely be back!"

Place was super clean and warm (it was rainy and cool the night we stayed), with combined heater/ac wall unit which was more than sufficient. Overall, a place we really enjoyed and will be looking forward to staying again."

Easy to access from I-95, but what a secluded slice of paradise. Shannon had anticipated every traveler need and addressed it. Thank-you! There isn much to choose from for dining, so you may want to grab something and bring it with you. We got take-out at the nearby chinese restaurant and it was surprisingly very good! It didnt look like much on the outside, but their vegetarian options were plentiful and done very well. I would recommend this stay to anyone. Oops - almost forgot the lovely animals, very sweet alpacas, goats and sheep - just fell in love 10X over."

I felt like we were way out in the country but it was only a short drive off 95 to the property. In the morning it was equally easy to get back on our route. I checked out Shannon’s guide book and found the recommendation for the Eggs Up Grill- we grabbed a great “to go” breakfast from there. We would love to come back again to the farm and spend more time with the animals!

Stayed with a pet","Shannon was kind enough to allow our pets to stay with us in the booking so we truly appreciate that. The place itself looked just like in the pictures.
We did have some trouble locating the cottage entry. We called the host's phone # at least 3 times but seeing that there was no response and that the message from the host we received earlier that day indicated check-in ended at 11:00 pm we need it to find the cottage quickly. When we booked this place nor the next day after our check-in was this displayed on the listing. We were very nervous to miss the check-in time reason why by mistake we entered the neighbor's property. Terrible mistake as we were approached with firearms. We apologized and exit out their property. The host provides pictures but that's on the ""how to get in"" instructions which typically are for instructions on how to get in inside the property once located. The fact that it was already dark didn't help and being able to reach the host would have been great."

Stayed with kids","Our family of 4 stayed for a long weekend on Shannon’s farm for New Year’s. We had such a great experience. The farm is small and peaceful, perfect for disconnecting from day to day life and making memories. Our boys, 11 and 6, had the best time exploring, feeding, petting, and making friends with all the animals. It’s obvious Shannon loves the farm, everything is well cared for. The cottage is in the middle of the barnyard, there are free roaming chickens and cats (all friendly), and the larger animals are fenced. It is quite cozy inside, which works well for us. Everything was clean and had just what was needed for our stay. We brought food and our InstantPot and only left for 1 meal out while there. The usual variety of restaurants are maybe 10-15 minutes away. Bonus: We had farm fresh eggs for breakfast each morning! Shannon was very kind and easy to talk to, always responsive. 5/5, we hope to visit again!"

Stayed with kids","We were lucky enough to book both locations on Shannon's property this past weekend. Our stay was nothing short of incredible!! ** Everything in both locations was VERY CLEAN and smelled fresh. Cleanliness is of utmost importance to me, especially having a 2 year old. ** Waking up to the sound of the rooster crowing, and peeking out to the animals was exactly what we needed for a little family getaway. In our family, it was my husband, our 2 year old and myself. If you're not familiar with country living, don't expect to be inside since the internet could be spotty at times. However, there's so much to do outside that we didn't care to be inside. The bed was spacious and comfortable, and there were two other bunk beds located off the bathroom. The shower was relaxing and water got very hot, which is a plus. There was everything we needed to make food for us as well. Overall Shannon and Kevin were kind, down to earth, and willing to go above and beyond in helping us with whatever we needed! To note, the eggs they provided from their free range chickens were delicious. Although we have chickens and ducks at our little farm, it's still exciting to wake up on another farm and have eggs for breakfast. We definitely cannot wait to be back again and visit everyone."

Stayed with kids",Shannon’s home was pristine. The farm is well manicured and beautiful spot to spend some time. We brought our young kids and they loved the animals. Food for the animals is provided and you can explore at your own leisure. Shannon is very attentive with requests (she lives just across the pond) and was at our door in under 2 minutes with our special request. We Will return and would definitely recommend.

The Cottage is a clean, comfortable, and quiet (but it is a farm! She was clear about the presence of farm animals, and their noises were entirely expected and welcome). We brought our dog with her approval. He was delighted to sniff and stretch. Ask about fresh eggs! We will return on our next trip, if The Cottage is available!"

The kitchen made it easy to prepare a simple morning meal. The cottage is located in a rather rural area (which we loved). Look for street names not route numbers, and save the turn by turn directions in case you briefly lose GPS as we did for a minute. No trouble finding it with that info available. Fine cell signal and wifi at the cottage. We look forward to visiting again next time we're traveling through the area.

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed the peacefulness of this home. It rained so I couldn't enjoy the back porch or the fire pit but I plan to visit again in November or December and hopefully my family and I get to make some s'mores! lol
I think I left everything as she asked. When booking the check out time is 10:00 am. On the fridge in the kitchen check out time is 11:00 a.m. I could of slept an extra hour in that nice cozy king size bed. So I wasn't sure which time is correct.Other than that It was lovely and would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice country peaceful getaway.
Great Job Wanda❤️"

Stayed with a pet","The reviews are 100% Correct!
After being in South Carolina for two weeks with pups in tow, we began heading out on the long journey home. Abruptly however, we had car trouble that took 8 hours to resolve and caused essentially a lost day of travel. We needed respite close to the dealership and quickly found this beautiful home away from home. Thanks so much to Wanda, who responded immediately and welcomed an early check-in. Our stress from the day melted away as we circled round the back and stood under the tall trees and felt the calming breeze. Bliss! Pictures do not capture justly the property which is fantastically decorated for that sweet tea and fresh from-the-oven cookie feel. Speaking of happiness, yummy snacks were left abound, likened to a buffet. Nom. Nom. Thank you! Rest assured your visit will be idyllic and I recommend that you stay as long as you can, for THIS was the ONLY Airbnb location we’ve visited where my husband said it felt like home.
Happy Travels. XOXO"

the house was perfect, off the highway enough to be in the country, but close enough not to be out of the way.
the house is definitely a country chic farmhouse, very clean, everything labeled, and very well stocked. it felt like a family member's house, not a rental.
Wanda was a great host, and I would recommend this place highly."

The home smelled fresh and clean without the use of air fresheners and cleaning products. There were thoughtful details throughout like snacks, throw pillows, throw blankets, magazines, and children's books. The toiletries and kitchen items were beyond our expectations. The back yard was a safe place for the children to play and for a campfire. The home was meticulously cleaned and maintained. I would definitely recommend Wanda's cottage to weary travelers or those looking for a quiet retreat."

There was a high chair for our baby and a lot of snacks and amenities around the house that made for a hospitable stay.

There even is a dog bed and dog dishes in case your canine companion is with you. Beds are comfortable. Heat and a/c function well (and you have control of the thermostat which is marvelous).

The home was sparkling clean, cozy, cute, and we felt right ""at home"" as soon as we walked in. Our family sure did appreciate the snacks and coffee bar provided! We also loved resting and relaxing on both the front and back porch with our pup, Lucy. A very peaceful backyard - just what we needed for us to rest after driving long hours. We also felt very safe knowing that the owners lived directly across from the home, if we needed anything! We can't say enough good things about this little treasure of a home, I'm sure that we will be back when traveling down south again. Thank you so much for opening your adorable home and hosting us!!"

Staying here close to family helped with the grieving process. Will stay here again with future trips to the area. A 100 times better than staying in an hotel and cheaper.

Just 5 minutes from I95 but very rural and quiet which we were looking for with our dog who barks at everything .We arrived late and the lights were turned on for us. The house had lots of little touches . Coffee bar,snacks(ding dongs),doggie dishes and bags, xtra blankets ,nice towels and good shower pressure .As former AirBnB hosts were picky and this will be our new stopover . Oh and really important…CLEAN.Thank you!"

We look forward to a restful night here to break up our drive between Doylestown PA and Stuart FL.
It's a great location and Wanda & Steve are really thoughtful hosts; they provide amenities which are unexpected - but appreciated (microwavable popcorn, instant oatmeal, a coffee 'station'...even crackers and Ding Dongs!)
We like this place so much, we recommended it to our in-laws who will be staying there later this month on their way from PA to FL!
And we plan on reserving this again for our way home in early May."

Stayed with a pet","Wanda was a great host and the accommodation was convenient and well appointed. The only ding concerns the website disclosures. Specifically, the pets on furniture rule and corresponding fee is buried on the website so we did not learn of this until arrival, at which point, it was too late to make other arrangements. I suggest that simply charging a flat $50 fee for pets would be more transparent and consistent with a 'pet friendly' policy. We would have gladly paid this up-front. Additional fees for any pet-related damage (beyond residual pet hair) would, of course be warranted."

Stayed one night",Overall I had an amazing stay place looks as described and comfy home. Great location. Although after check out I was accused of leaving paint on the bathroom wall and a pull from vanity. Oil and wax residue being left I took full accountability for oil and wax even though I went through and cleaned as much as possible and scraped up wax easy enough for it to be swept up and oil residue just to be wiped over nothing harmful to damage anything by the way it was baby oil… after assure host that I had paint no where in bathroom for it to be put on the wall and that the pull for the vanity was there before I arrived I was told the “paint” that was told I left on the wall was cost by some type of reaction for the dishwasher to whatever oil was used that created a “red stain” on the wall(keep in mind I only used butter to cook & I left a paint tray for others) and baby oil that was was only used in the room but the satin appeared as purple still unsure of the pulled vanity accusations.

Perhaps providing ear plugs and with some sound insulation installed it would be better? Still it was very clean and I felt safe. Bed was comfortable and the blankets were nice.

People upstairs should be asked to attempt to have a light step and minimize going up a d down the stairs and avoid slamming the door seeing that it is directly next to the bedroom on the 1st floor. I would not stay at this location again. May want to take the rugs in the bedroom up because they are a fall hazard because they slip right under your feet. Overall, it was nice."

It was an easy walk to downtown to take care of some last minute move details. It’s even pet friendly which was a plus with our fur baby making the move with us. We will definitely recommend this cute cottage when we have family visit us in the area!

Stayed one night","Comfy beds is my number one thing and they had those. Very clean and cozy and charming. Very roomy and cute decor and I loved the character they left from the old building! Very responsive hosts! The sound machines was a helpful touch!
We are perfectly nimble but if you have trouble getting around this might not be a fit for you if you have a cane, walker or wheelchair, as there are lots “funky/charming” ups and downs to move around the space.
The listing says house so that confused me a bit to realize it was a downstairs apartment. So, just know there could be someone walking around upstairs at 7am. But it wasn’t too noisy at all and the whole downstairs has its own courtyard and entrance which is really nice!"

My daughter really enjoyed the space. She said the bed was super comfortable and enjoyed being able to control the air conditioning. She had everything she needed for a long term stay, including a washer and dryer. As a mom, I also appreciated that the owners came by the property to check on things and made their presence known.

My only recommendation is that anyone who is a light sleeper bring sound canceling headphones or earbuds. There was noise (just people walking around, nothing loud) coming from the upstairs part of the duplex until well past midnight. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep without my AirPods. It wasn’t anything terribly disturbing, but for anyone who is sensitive to noise, it’s something to be aware of!"

Stayed one night","Had a great one night stay at Kali's place. Nice and peaceful back in the woods with a cute space - perfect for two people. We had everything we needed and more, the small deck was a nice feature, especially with the screens for the doors, we could open it up and listen to the rain. We would definitely stay again when in Florence!"

Stayed one night","This is a cozy, cute cabin nestled at the edge of the woods behind the main house. Well remodeled and decorated w/great selection of furnishings. Sofa was cushy, but not saggy. Nice appliances, nice shower/tub and linens. Double bed was ok, but rather squeaky. Back deck was delightful & peaceful, but quite dirty. Narrow driveway very bumpy over tree roots with tight turn around at cabin, but worked fine for our mid-size SUV. Very nice neighborhood close in. All-in-all a very good place to stay."

It's tight, but if you have a small car or suv, just drive very slowly. There's plenty of space in front of the main house to park for larger vehicles or if you're concerned about the tight space. Kali's space has everything you need!"

As the other reviews mention, the driveway down to the cottage IS VERY TIGHT. I have a Nissan Rogue, so definitely need a smaller vehicle to navigate the driveway. But, you can park at the top of her driveway if you feel more comfortable. Hoping to come back in September. But would highly recommend, and will definitely stay again, when in town."

Bedroom has a dresser and closet, the bed was a double and a little hard (but I'm older too). The driveway is long and narrow, it's a little tight where you park but just have to go slow."

Anything we could have needed was provided, including toiletries. It was clean and conveniently located. We couldn’t have asked for more. We will definitely consider Kali’s place first if we get back to Florence one day!"

Group trip","The house was remarkably clean. It is updated, spacious and well-equipped, down to fun games. Patricia was responsive, helpful and kind. The house was bigger than the pictures showed, IMO. We were 5 women in town for tennis state championships and the various venues were all within 15 - 20 minutes from the home. The home is in a low-rent community of similar, respectful homes of seemingly hard-working people. Some nights were loud outdoors (neighbors coming in late, hanging out outside) but we never once felt unsafe and we all just used White Noise apps on our phones to ensure a great night's sleep. Directly across from the community is a large and nice-looking park. Otherwise the home isn't far from amenities like grocery stores, gas stations and chain restaurants. I'd definitely book this home again when we're in town for tennis again. (Of note: the home allows pets, so one of our teammates had to get a hotel room after the first night due to allergies...the rest of us didn't react.)"

It had everything we needed, the beds were comfortable and the house was decorated with a cute decor. The master bedroom and bathroom are both very large with the house being a perfect size for our group of 4. I would definitely stay here again and it was the perfect distance for our trip to Darlington Raceway. Patricia was also very responsive and helpful with any of my questions along the way. Great all around!"

The clean up person I’d say needs to dust the floors and under the bed and refrigerator… the couch cover kept coming off, other than that I would most definitely stay again. My teens loveddddd it..: the games were so much fun."

The back yard if you had a dog it could get out through whole in picket fence. It was just bam right next to other houses. Im not use to that. We were there for my daughters wedding and her location had me 30 min from the venue. Over all house and location was great for my purpose. Thank you

Tania‘s place took that extra worry away. Her place is located in a beautiful, quiet residential neighborhood and when we walked into the house we were quite impressed. Everything was beautifully decorated and her place was spotless. For a group of 8, we never felt crowded and were all very comfortable. Beds are always the deal maker or breaker for me, and THOSE beds were COMFORTABLE!!! I wish I could’ve stayed in the bed much longer 😄:) Each of the bathrooms were stocked with the necessary toiletries and the little snack basket in the kitchen added a nice touch. We got lucky with this place for sure!"

Group trip","I've stayed in a lot of airbnb's, but this was without a doubt one of the best ones. It was updated, had enough furniture to in the living space to accommodate 6 people, the beds are relatively comfortable, and it was VERY clean. I never had to worry about getting in touch, because the communication was fast and consistent. We were very grateful for the ammenities that were provided, specifically the coffee products and the shower items. One of us forgot our toiletry travel bag, so it was a relief to find shampoo, conditioner, body wash AND lotion! We also enjoyed exploring the area and some of the local events going on during our time here; this space is near one of the main strips with gas stations, restaurants, shopping, and not too far from the downtown area. The price tag might be a little bit higher than most, and it can be scary to choose a space without a lot of reviews, but I assure you it's worth it! If we ever find ourselves back in Florence, this will be my go to :)"

- I stayed here with 4 of my family members and they could not stop talking it. The words they used to describe the house is “homey, comfortable, and clean”. The king suite has its own bathroom and living area, and the two smaller rooms provide optimal privacy. The kitchen had everything you needed including seasonings, pots, appliance, tea and coffee. The bathrooms were stocked with toiletries and great quality towels. There is also a washer/dryer, which Leslie provides detergent for. I have already recommended the property to others and would not hesitant to stay here again. Thank you Leslie for the Southern Hospitality!"
