Stayed one night","My son was traveling from Colorado to NC and needed a place to stay. I recommended an airbnb and set it up for him. Jane was awesome!! Her communication is perfect and the space is great! Per my son: “Space is cozy and comfortable. The owners are friendly, caring and make sure you have everything you need.”
We all hope to stay here on future trips."

Stayed a few nights","Upon arrival, the owners house appeared unkempt. Making my way to the backyard where the airbnb was was over run with plants and had unsure footing.
The airbnb itself could use some cleaning and updating. The tiny house had some strong odors which included the composting toilet and maybe some mold/mildew. The main floor futon bed was very uncomfortable. The pillows had no protective cover on them, only a pillowcase.
I had booked a two night stay but ended up leaving early, after one night, due to allergies and overall discomfort."

Stayed one night","Jane's place met my 3 C's standard, clean, cozy and comfortable! We were only there one night on our way west and it was a perfect place to relax after 8 hours on the road. We relaxed on the hammock and enjoyed the lush surroundings. The neighborhood was extremely quite, we slept with the windows open, we heard a barred owl calling during the night. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of pillows and blankets. The bathroom and kitchen had all we needed. If we pass thru the area again, we would stay again."

Stayed one night","My life partner and I were on a road trip across the United States and we were passing through Missouri on our way back. Our original planned location to stay for the evening wasn’t quite shaping up, and then we found this perfect tiny home tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood. All we needed was a quiet place to relax and sleep so we could finish our return trip in the morning and this was everything we needed.
The host was extremely responsive and since our stay was very short notice, it was truly wonderful to have such a pleasant person to interact with. The space itself was exactly as advertised if not better. My partner and I don’t need a lot of space, so the tiny home suited us perfectly. We had everything we needed to refresh ourselves and get a great nights rest.
I would easily recommend this location to anyone!"

I would not bring kids or anyone with a disability here due to the ladder and small space, but I would 100% stay again and recommend it to the right guests! They use their own filtration systems to water the yard so it’s good to be mindful of that regarding products with chemicals you may use in the shower or dumping liquids down the drains."

Stayed one night","It was overall a very cute and comfortable place in a pretty neighborhood. I probably would not stay here again though because the smell from the composting toilet was pretty bad. Upstairs where I slept I didn't notice it much, but I also had covid recently so my sense of smell is negligible. However, my guest who slept on the downstairs was bothered by the smell all night, for them it was an unpleasant stay only for that reason, but they are a heavier person and weren't comfortable climbing up the stairs to sleep, so we didn't switch places. I felt bad. Otherwise a great value and no other complaints at all."

The personal touches and lofted bedroom space made us feel like we were in a treehouse all our own. Also appreciated the place's commitment to sustainability and how easy they made it for us to participate as well.
We were in Columbia for the weekend and found the location to be within 10-15 minutes of everything we wanted to see / needed to get to. Highly recommend!"

It was pretty warm out so we did need yo put the air conditioning on high and use the fan. I did forget my eye mask and the Treehouse does not have room darkening curtains, so if you need complete darkness to sleep, make sure to bring an eye mask.
We will definitely stay again."

Not only is the home is surrounded by nature but the inside has nature in mind which my fam appreciated (organic/biodegradable soaps/shampoos, FANTASTIC organic coffee - even a gray water composting toilet). I even spent a bit of time on the porch with my laptop knocking out a little work, and was kept company by their two VERY lovely, friendly dogs. :) Jane was super responsive and a great host!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a great little place. I stayed here for 2 nights with my grown son while we were in town for a family gathering over the weekend. It was perfect for 2 grown adults; he stayed in the upstairs loft and I stayed downstairs. This was a comfortable arrangement for the 2 of us but I can see where a family of 4 could also stay here if it were 2 adults and 2 children. My bed was comfortable and the hosts were friendly, accommodating, and pleasant. My son accidentally locked us out with the keys still inside the house, and I felt terrible but I had to knock on the hosts’ door at 9pm to get back in. Despite how foolish I felt, Dan was super understanding and kind about it and helped us right away. All good! The hosts also provided a delicious bag of coffee for us w/filtered water for brewing, along with Stevia, honey and powdered milk to add if we cared to. All in all it was a very pleasant stay and I would definitely stay here again. I hope we are welcome to come back! 🤗❤️"

I stayed with my friend and her husband after a concert and the layout will easily sleep 4, just not a lot of space to walk. Very eco friendly and comfy feel. It does have a AC unit inside so would be helpful to turn on upon check-in if you're staying in the summer (we didn't have the opportunity to stop by earlier upon check-in but the room cooled down within 20-30 minutes!). Dogs were super friendly and would be a perfect spot to have a cup of coffee on the front deck. Would definitely stay again :)"

Getting from street parking to tiny house was a little challenging. The path to the house was narrow & dark, the backyard gate was cumbersome for us with our bags in the dark.
We had what we needed to get a good night’s rest & back on the road early the next morning - the AC & fans kept us cool - fridge/freezer good."

Stayed one night","Absolutely worth it for a short stay, or maybe even a long stay, in Columbia. I work often in Jefferson City and had to get a quick reservation for a one-night stay in the general area of the state, and this tiny house was perfect. The price was beyond reasonable, and I was actually much more impressed with the place when I arrived than I had expected to be when I booked it. The tiny house itself is idyllic, sitting in the backyard of a beautiful property surrounded by all types of greenery. It's split into two levels- a main level with the main bed/living area and bathroom, and a loft area with two more small beds that is accessible by a secure step ladder. The neighborhood is incredibly quiet, to be so close to downtown Columbia (less than a 5 minute drive away). Everything was clean and ready for my arrival when I got there. The check-in/check-out process could not have been simpler. Very clear instructions from the host. Could not be happier with my experience. Thanks again, Jane!"

I initially had trouble finding the bath towels, but eventually spotted them neatly rolled up on the shelf under the ladder. For those who like to sleep in darkness, I’d suggest unplugging the lights on the porch to make the downstairs sleeping area darker ( the curtains provide nice privacy, but they are not heavy enough to block the porch lights). I enjoyed the coffee selection, which allowed me to be on my way in the morning with a nice caffeine buzz."

At night with the string lights, it makes you feel like you just stepped into a tree house in the woods. I enjoyed my time on the porch. It was so cute on the inside and comfortable. Across the street, there was a cute little take one, leave one box which is cool if you like treasures. It's also across from a preserve. (Please pick up your trash.) This place was all by chance and I'm glad I took it! Take a chance, you won't be disappointed."

Never even felt cramped because everything is so tidy and clean. It was well lit when we arrived after the sun had set, which was an especially fun way to find the home and walk into it. We loved that we could easily make coffee in the morning, too and sit on the patio out front! Then we were close by (driving) to a restaurant for breakfast (Nourish). I wish we could have stayed longer.

Stayed a few nights","The loft was very nice, and it was clean. The brick and old wood floors were charming and comfortable. Everything was as described and we did not hear street noise, which is important to us. Vanessa was responsive the few times we reached out. Our one issue, and it was considerable for us, is that the king bed in the master room has a broken frame which caused a deep dip down the middle of the bed which made sleeping fairly uncomfortable. We did let Vanessa know about this the first morning after we slept in the bed, and she did come over while we were gone and placed some towels under in an attempt to even out the bed, but that did now work. The problem was a severely bent bed frame and as a result we did not sleep well any of the 6 nights we stayed. If the frame gets fixed this would be a very pleasant place to stay and it would have earned a 5 star review. Also, the blinds in the several large windows do not work and cannot be turned up, and as a result light is not deflected well."

Stayed a few nights","Will definitely book again! Another outstanding stay at Jessica's place. Super caring, responsive, friendly, and proactive host. Before we arrived, Jessica contacted us to explain that she had just found some damage to the TV from the previous stay (the day before). Not a big deal to us but the explanation and options offered were appreciated and courteous. We had a couple small needs (more TP) during our stay and again, Jessica was extremely responsive and handled them right away. We have stayed here twice when attending events at the Mizzou Aquatic Center, which is a nice easy walk. Private off-street parking is included! Downtown is just outside so there is great walkability to restaurants & entertainment. Note: there is occasional street noise & a bit of light due to the proximity to downtown, not a problem for us, but if you're sensitive a white noise app or sleep mask (good travel items even in hotels or wherever you go) may be useful."

The old warehouse vibe creates a truly unique experience. I'd honestly say this is one of the best VRBOS we have ever stayed at and I will be rebooking here whenever I can. Can't thank the host enough...thank you!!!!

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Vanessa's place while dropping our daughter off for her freshman year at Mizzou. The location was super convenient to her dorm - literally down the street - and I was excited to realize it was also next door to Flat Branch Bar & Grill, a restaurant we'd enjoyed during a previous visit to campus. The apartment is super convenient to loads of other restaurants, shops, the Mizzou campus and the MKT trail. We appreciated the included parking and the walkability of amenities.
The unit itself is a great space! The beds and couch were all super comfortable, and we loved having some room to stretch out after maneuvering around our daughter's tiny dorm room during the day :) While we didn't do any cooking, we did notice that the kitchen was well stocked to do so (and we were very grateful for the coffee, filters and coffee maker provided.)
We hope to rent Vanessa's place again for future visits down to Mizzou."

Stayed a few nights","This place was in a centrally located spot in a college town. Very easy to get around by car and on foot. Safe parking area for tenants and the unit was like home for us. Airy, sunny and spacious. It was quiet even with Flat Branch Pub traffic (which is steps from the front door. Cannot miss this for some really great food. The day I left I spoke to some employees about the BBQ sauce and when I packed up the car there was a note on my windshield to stop by and knock on the door. They packed me up some sauce to take home). There was nothing but kindness from everyone we met. Glenn's place has great shrimp creole (and mac n cheese if you have kiddos). Sparky's was amazing for ice cream and we found a great spot for bagels and drinks for breakfast. All of these locations were within 4 blocks. Lots of shops but closed due to the holiday even on a monday. There are alot of outdoor activities as well. We took a short hike to the Devil's Ice Box but there is much more to explore"

Stayed one night","I took my Mother and Wife to see Tab Benoit at The Blue Note this weekend. I found this loft to be within walking distance to the venue, and it looked nice so I rented it for the night. And let me just say, the pictures posted here don't do this loft justice. It's very beautiful and elegant, even more so in person. Vanessa really nailed it on this one! The view of downtown is superb, the old wood floors are exquisitely well preserved and honestly, set the tone for this property. It's also like a modernized barn feel inside. Just Gorgeous! There are so many wonderful places to eat and experience within walking distance. The next time we plan a trip to Columbia, we are definitely going to be renting one of Vanessa's excellent locations! 11 out of 10 stars! Thanks for allowing us the pleasure of staying here! We really enjoyed our stay!"

The condo is situated perfectly in Columbia - walking distance to the MU campus, downtown and the Columbia trail system, which is arguably the city's most beautiful assets with it's wooded paths that wind throughout the entire city - perfect for our long runs!

Stayed a few nights","This is by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. I grew up in Columbia and I had no idea there was this cool of an apartment so close to all the action. The place itself was the pinnacle of comfort and utility. The couch and bed were both so comfortable I took turns sleeping on them at night. The internet was great so I was able to work the whole time. The tv was monstrous with access to whatever you want to watch.
It was really cold one of the days and I was dreading having to go outside. Unfortunately, the batteries for the remote had died. I contacted the owner to ask if they had batteries on the property and unfortunately they did not. I was gearing up to make the couple block trek to find some, and before I could they had dropped some off for me… with a hooded sweatshirt to help keep me warm. I’m not suggesting the owner can or will go out of their way every time, but this was a level of service and kindness I haven’t seen many times. 10/10 would rent again."

The lift is spacious and beautifully restored, and the location is really convenient for just about everything you need—coffee shops, restaurants, downtown shops, and there’s even a hiking trail right behind the building. The host is incredibly responsive to any question, also. Very much recommended."

It was clean, spacious and comfortable, truly a great value for the price. There were only two of us and our dogs, but it would also be great for a larger family. It was tastefully and thoughtfully decorated, as well as being extremely well-stocked with everything we could imaginably need for our stay. The host even welcomed our dogs with a dog bed, clean water set out in a cute water dish when we arrived and even a poop scooper in the fenced backyard. We also appreciated having bins for recycling in the garage. (Usually, we're looking for a recycling drop-off or hauling it back home with us to recycle.) All in all, it was a wonderful experience and will be our first choice for our next visit to Columbia!"

The dining room area has a nice desk and chair for work, and the backyard/patio was great! I have stayed in many Airbnb homes in the Columbia area and this is by far my favorite for the comfortable beds and spacious living area! My daughter and her friends from Mizzou came for dinner and we had plenty of space to spread out and watch a movie. Will definitely stay again!"

Group trip","My group recently stayed at Ellen’s property while attending Columbia’s True False Film Festival. It’s located in a quiet, friendly neighborhood with lots of dog walkers and families outside during the day. Check in was easy with the keypad and convenient. The property was much larger than we anticipated as well! The living room and kitchen is a nice, open floor plan and feels very homey. Beds were also comfortable and we appreciated that the bathrooms were fully stocked with towels, bath soap and shampoo. Ellen was a very accommodating host and also mailed an item we had left behind which we thought was above and beyond. Would definitely stay here again for a future weekend trip. Thank you, Ellen!"

Everything was as advertised, but it was the very thoughtful little touches that made our stay extraordinary. Fluffy white towels and more of them than we could possibly use, but it was nice to have the option. Gorgeous and comfortable sheets and bed linens…comparable to a high end hotel. Desks in both bedrooms with a notepad and pen thoughtfully provided. Throws in both bedroom and on the sofa. Luggage racks and ample closet space. Fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Communication was excellent. I Will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This home was fantastic! We were in town for a Mizzou campus visit and stayed for the TN game. The neighborhood is older and less afluent, but Tom has done a wonderful job updating the home, inside and out! Great curb appeal with the adorable landscaping. Sets a great tone when you pull in the driveway. Then going in the home, we immediately felt welcome and comfortable. Very clean and comfortable. The amenities provided are some of the best we've seen at a property rental - nice closet set up, abundance of towels, chargers (electrical and USB) on each bedside, and plenty of mirrors. These might be small things, but they make a big difference for the guest. Also, there was a very cute snack basket, plenty of coffee/tea, and other non-perishable condiments. Water bottles provided in the refrigerator, a full tray of ice, and large square ice cubes were a plus! Also, washer/dryer and supplies available. Tom communicated extremely well. Would highly recommend and stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely perfect in every regard. We travel on a regular basis and usually stay at an Airbnb. This was, by far, the cleanest, most comfortable, and most welcoming home we’ve ever stayed at. Easily the best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had. The entire house has been recently remodeled with high quality materials and beautiful detailed touches. There were snacks left for us and drinks in the fridge, there was a detailed binder with all of the property details, local recommendations for food and entertainment, and fast Wi-Fi. The check in and check out times were very gracious. Everything we could have possibly needed had been accounted for. The home was located very close to the colleges and downtown but on an extremely quiet street with great privacy. The beds were incredibly comfortable with high quality mattresses and thick, soft, fluffy comforters. Tons of extra towels and excellent toiletries provided. Very highly recommend this for anyone staying in or near Columbia."

The living room is nicely arranged and comfortable while the dining room table easily fits six adults. The kitchen (including the oven) was immaculately clean with plenty of pot and pans for cooking. We did have an issue with the dishwasher. Less than a week before checkout, it stopped working and even though Tom tried to fix it, it would be a week before anyone would be able to come check it out. We also had a problem with the television, and Tom came right over and got it working for us. The beds are comfortable. The bathroom is small but well appointed, and the large shower is luxurious. The house is in an older neighborhood, but it was quiet. Downtown and shopping are convenient. We would definitely stay at Tom's house again."

Combined with off-street parking with motion detection outside lighting, this place is a pearl."

Stayed a few nights",It was a great stay and everything was a smooth process from booking to checking out. The house was completely remodeled and you can tell. Everything is brand new and nice. It was very close to Mizzou Arena for our event and other attractions. The street is quite for being in a city and you can easily enjoy a evening or morning on the porch in the rocking chairs. We felt very safe there. The only suggestion was a few board games or some cards for some entertainment if you wanted to stay in. The beds where beyond comfortable and we never wanted to get out of them. We felt like we where in a 5 star hotel. Tom was easily accessible if we had any issues and he checked on us during our stay as well. I would gladly recommend to anyone staying in the Columbia area.

Stayed over a week","Tom’s Airbnb was amazing and he was such a gracious host! We loved the snacks, the books, and all the amazing art work (there’s tons of signed pieces and I was surprised by how good some of the local writing was - incredible)!
We were staying here to be close to family and really loved the location as well. Small caveat is that my friends in Columbia said our place was in the bad part of town, but I must say that we never once felt that, and we walked downtown and to coffee shops a couple times a week.
Tom was working next door most of our stay and would make himself available there or via the airbnb chat if we had questions. We discovered he and his daughter used to own a restaurant in Denver (where we were visiting from) and he seemed like a very cool person. Looking forward to coming back!"

One of my favorite things about this property is the fact that when you are settings things up and communicating with Tom, you soon find out that he's the owner. He and his wife completely designed and renovated this place. I consider Central Bungalow my home away from Austin, TX. I rate it 5 stars!"

Stayed one night","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Vanessa's loft in Columbia, and it truly was a highlight of my trip. From the thoughtful brunch and dinner recommendations to the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the loft itself, every detail made my stay memorable.
Vanessa suggested visiting Café Berlin and Uprise Bakery, and both places did not disappoint. These recommendations were a delightful touch that added local flavor to my visit. The loft, with its perfect blend of comfort and style, provided a peaceful retreat after a day of exploring. Its central location made getting around the city a breeze, and the space itself reminded me of a chic NYC studio – full of charm and character.
What made my stay especially enjoyable was Vanessa's attention to detail and hospitality. The loft was well-equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay, and Vanessa's communication was prompt and helpful throughout.
I highly recommend Vanessa's loft to anyone looking for a unique and cozy stay!"

She answered all my questions actually very promptly, she was a great help. We love the location, my son, and I got to walk downtown to eat and to get ice cream and hang out. It is centrally located in Columbia. If you are going to campus or if you have stuff to do downtown in Columbia, this is a great location. I highly recommend Vanessa and her units. She is an excellent host"

There are lots of (walkable) restaurants nearby as well. The bed was soft, the water pressure was fantastic, and I couldn’t hear any noise while inside. The apartment itself is spacious and super cute. I used Uber to and from the Columbia airport but if you have a car, there’s a designated parking spot for you. If you’re searching for a place in the area, I highly recommend staying at Vanessa’s."

We were unable to figure out how to use the Ninja grill, so we were not able to dine in the home at all, but this was likely user error! Make sure you know how to use the device if you plan to cook at home. Otherwise, the stay was wonderful. Michelle is very clear in her listing that this is the top half of the back apartment, connected to her home. The photos are clearly labeled as ""only to help with directions."" However since the listing title says that it's the Entire Home, make sure you understand what you are booking!"

Everything was clean and comfortable. There is a small amount of traffic noise but nothing abnormal and to be expected at a location close to town. We found so many great restaurants.

It was beautiful and made me feel at home instantly with fresh muffins waiting. The rooms were nice size and beautiful!!! The cleanliness of the house was impeccable. They provided games and the connection to the television was easy. Which is important when we wanted to relax, watch Harlem with a glass of wine 😉👌🏽!! If the weather was better I would have loved to sit on the front porch or back patio that was fenced in. And an awesome benefit is that everything was literally within 5 to 10 miles drive. Restaurants, bar/ grills, mall, and shopping area. I truly loved this place. Couldn’t ask for a more perfect first Airbnb stay!!!!"

There was easy entry and access to the hiway making it convenient. We didn't have time to venture downtown but we did make a late night trip to the closest Walmart a few miles away. Upon arriving at early nighttime and driving through the neighborhoods as well as when driving to Walmart, we did have concerns of the safety of the area, which unfortunately impacted our ability to relax and enjoy the evening and comfort of the stay. Our worries may have been completely unfounded, but I would encourage renters to become informed about the local neighborhoods.."

Stayed one night","We had stayed in Kathryn's three bedroom rental, but not the two bedroom ahead of this trip. It did not disappoint. We liked the layout of the house, and the cleanliness and decor is depicting of what we have experienced in the other home, complete with delicious muffins for breakfast. We prefer to stay in rentals with kitchens, and though this kitchen is a galley style, it is open to both the living and dining rooms. My mother, husband and I felt very at home during our overnight stay en route to see family in Nebraska."

Just a note, because we missed it and it was obviously on the description and pictures. There is not a TV, couch, or actual shower. Just be aware, if you are like me and just assume. But you cannot beat the location.
Also the internet was very spotty for two people trying to work."

Stayed with a pet","I was visiting Columbia for my son's graduation and Navy Officer commissioning. I was lucky enough to find this reasonably priced rental. Very close by the University but still far enough away from.traffic areas.. Mark was very communicative and responsive in our back and forth communications. The house is very nice. The kitchen was usable and accessible and the details were great. The bedroom was in the back of the house which provided a lot of privacy and coziness. After a long day of driving in cold conditions it was an absolute great experience to use the upgraded design deep tub. The house's exterior surroundings and the area next to the rental were safe and easy access for my dogs
I was very pleased with this rental and would highly recommend someone else to book this rental."

However, beware there are a lot of noisy neighbors. There’s a bird scooter drop on the corner and what appears to be college kids all around. Our dogs were kept up all night which kept us up. A TV would be a big help to drown out music.
If you don’t mind that, this is your spot! It may be a quiet night when you stay."

Stayed a few nights","The 1920s House was very cute & clean. We definitely got a few modern design ideas for our own arts n crafts home :) Overall, the house was very clean and well appointed. Loved the Euro kitchen and the view out past the cool tree to the neighbor's sweet little garden- was such a nice way to start the day. It rained like crazy when we were there... We enjoyed stepping out onto the big porch to watch the storm blow by :) Bed was comfy and again... just nice touches thru out. Check in was easy and Mark ALWAYS responded quickly to any questions we had :) It is a not far from the highway and relatively close to downtown. Was exactly 1 mile to our daughter's dorm- so a quick drive :)
For those who care, there is no TV. But there is great wifi. We didn't find that to be a problem for us. We brought our own games to play so TV time or lack there of isn't a deal break for us at all. Just an FYI to others.
Lastly, the living room is exactly as shown in the fotos with a couple of Adirondack chairs. Altho the chairs not totally uncomfortable.. they are difficult or tedious to climb in/out of over and over again even for little yogis like me. Therefore, for those w/ mobility issues or those wanting to just cuddle up on a small sofa w/ their family to chat or even to sit alone to read a book.. that isn't really an option. Keeping that in mind... This is a sweet little house to consider for the next time you stay in Columbia :-)"

Stayed a few nights",This was an amazing stay! I stayed here with my dog while in town for work. Mark left a basket with supplies for my dog which was so kind and thoughtful. The home was beautiful and updated and very clean! I would recommend this home to anyone visiting Columbia!

Stayed a few nights","Mark and co-host Danielle are kind and accommodating, and their space is stylish, clean, and quite roomy, and the location is really convenient for walking downtown. My partner's take: it was a place he was glad to return to after a day of exploring CoMO. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there are a few things I wish I had known before booking, so here I'll just mention these things.
First, there's no shower, in the sense that you're probably used to--there's a nice tub (with great insulation for long baths) with a spray wand, but if you want to ""shower"" (e.g., after a long sweaty bike ride), you have to figure out how to do this while sitting in the tub (or with one hand while standing and not accidentally spraying water out of the tub? because there's no curtain).
Second, unfortunately, the house has blinds in every window except for the bathroom window, so if you like privacy in the bathroom, you should think of booking elsewhere. Finally, a few things I wished I had brought with me include (1) my own pillow (pillows were thin and sparse), and (2) tissues (only toilet paper and paper towels were provided).
I will also just mention that I booked this place--listed as ""pet friendly""--hoping that my partner and I could travel with our two cats, in case we didn't find a sitter. However, this space is not really pet-friendly, in the sense that the hosts require pets stay crated whenever they are not monitored, and that they never sit on furniture, which isn't a realistic expectation regarding pet behavior, even for very well-behaved cats. In the end, I'm glad we found the sitter instead."

Stayed a few nights","Everything was as described and was very clean. The bathtub was amazing! There was not, however, a good hang out space as it was too cold to sit on the unheated enclosed porch. Would be much better during warmer weather."

Stayed a few nights","What a great place at a great price! Mark and Danielle's bungalow was awesome- we sat on the enclosed back porch each morning for coffee and breakfast as the sun came up, and it was incredible. We were able to walk to downtown Columbia in less than 5 minutes and enjoy the breakfast places and nightlife. We will definitely be staying there this Fall!"

The house was decorated so nice and it had everything we could've needed for our stay. Danielle was also very communicative and quick to respond, and checkin was a breeze!Thanks so much!"

Stayed one night","So, much, SPACE. Leg room all around and the layout is super easy to navigate. The aesthetic is appealing, homey, and artsy!! It made the stay super comfortable for me and my dog. That bathtub is probably the cherry on top of the whole experience with the full bedroom and adorable kitchen. Maybe one day in a warmer season I'll be able to enjoy the porch area but that was also very inviting even with the winter weather! Thank you to the communicative and helpful hosts!"
