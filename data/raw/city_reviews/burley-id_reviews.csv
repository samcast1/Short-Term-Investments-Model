Group trip",The house had everything that we needed. We were all very comfortable. Grandma had her own room. Mom and dad have their own room and the kids had their own beds. They enjoyed sharing rooms and slept well. All the beds were comfortable. No one had to sleep on an air mattress or floor or couch.

The house was spacious, the yard was beautiful, and Nathan was super helpful!
We were in town for a family reunion. At one point, my father-in-law who was staying at a local hotel asked me how much I’d paid for the weekend. When I told him, he looked so disappointed and told me that he’d paid more than double at a local hotel for the rest of the family.
We definitely felt like we were in the best place we could have been in!"

Nathan has been nothing short of proactive and accommodating to our schedule; we can't thank him enough for allowing us into this space. if you're looking for a large, comfortable space for your stay in Burley, then look no further than Nathan's home. Until next time... Thank you Nathan!"

Stayed a few nights",The location and view was very beautiful and close to the base of a gorgeous mountain! Jeff and his wife were incredibly friendly and cordial! The loft was of new construction and very well decorated. Ample lighting and big tv! Felt very cozy and at home there. Parking was on a nice concrete pad in front of entrance and key pad door lock made me feel nice and secure. Was a very nice neighborhood with beautiful pastures surrounding! Would love to stay there again when passing through!:)

The apartment has a wonderful view - mountain and farmland (we are partial to farmland). The location is very quiet and private.
Jeff was very responsive to all our questions. His instructions were clear for finding the rental.
Jeff’s place is a great place to relax and rest after a long day’s drive."

So it was nice having a place to wind down for that busy of a week. I am also sure I know the family. But I can’t be sure cause I didn’t see them at all during the week despite the place being attached to the house. I would recommend bringing like plastic plates and stuff. Cause the don’t have sliver wear. But they did have a microwave."

We stay at his place for a month and it really felt like a second home, everything was new clean and just felt very at home.

We had our privacy, in the times we did cross paths with the hosts, Laura and her husband made us feel welcome, made our kids feel comfortable and were very enjoyable to converse with. We couldn't have asked for better hosts. They were amazing! The place itself was very clean and had an at home feeling. Personally I loved that there were available cupboards in the kitchen so we had places to put our food other than the counter. They also had everything we needed to cook with utensils, dishes etc. They had a great yard for the kids to play and our kids wanted to play outside constantly and were always welcomed to do so. All 6 of us agreed in the future we would love to stay here again."

Stayed one night","At first we weren't sure if we were in the right place but it's exactly where you think it is at first. It's a cozy little guest house next to the main house and the Host was WONDERFUL. She was very responsive when we were confused at first and was lovely and very welcoming. As you walk in you first notice the homey feeling in the living room and the kitchen, as you go further into the guest house you start to feel like you've got a second home and it was very welcoming considering we arrived late in the night and were tired. We used the shower, the washer/dryer and the tub and everything was cleaner than a hotel. 10/10 would recommend that you stay here."

The bed was comfortable. I couldn't get cable that night but they had a nice selection of dvd's.
It got kind of warm so i opened the window and then heard all the trucks from the highway nearby.
The front yard was overgrown and had a couple goats, but they were cool.
The lake was nice, a short walk to get to and had a grassy area with picnic tables.
It was fine for the price and nice to experience the area.
There were some good restaurants a short drive away.
Also follow the hosts directions, maps took me the wrong way."

Someone even left AirPods behind and they let us know so we could get them."

Stayed with kids",Perfect place for our family with all the extra details. You can tell this home was well thought out with all the amenities. Fully stocked with whatever you would need (and the things you forgot you needed). This house makes you feel like you are home away from home. Loved the sleeping bag type blankets on the bunkbeds (genius) and good QUALITY shampoo and conditioner and handsoap in the bathrooms was a nice personal touch. Having access to park in the garage during winter was awesome. My little kids loved the playroom toys. We definitely will be back again. Thank you for sharing your home with us!

There were thoughtful additions for families to include 2 pack n plays, 2 booster seats, a high chair, and a very well stocked play room. Perfect for our crew!
And of course, the biggest measure for a 5-star review - the throw blankets! 😉 This place had great throw blankets stocked in all the right places!
In all seriousness, the host was responsive and flexible, and it is a very well cared for home. We plan to stay again in the future when visiting family."

Stayed with kids",The home fit our needs very well. We were able to play games at the large kitchen table. The kitchen itself was bigger than the photos illustrated which pleased me. The living area was large and there was room for a queen air mattress which was nice. The hall bath had a small sink counter but the bathroom was big enough and the tub/shower was good size. There are plenty of towels for a group and the master bedroom has an on-suite bathroom too. We found the kitchen had what we needed but might be nice to have a few other items if you were doing extensive cooking. I asked Jared if the place had a griddle for pancakes and it didn’t so he bought one. The yard is very large and fully fenced which we appreciated since we had a toddler and a small dog. The home stayed cool with the cooling units and everyone slept very well! I would stay at this place again. Thank you Jared!

We loved the fire pit with wood provided and spent much of the night out there just hanging out! We got to see people tending to the flower garden next door! Such a treat. The bed was cozy and we loved listening to records before going to sleep. Just perfect!!"

It’s only 45 minutes from the shoshone falls and is in a peaceful location great for a getaway. She also has a flower farm which you can pick your own flowers during the flower season to take a bouquet home which is pretty awesome!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I enjoyed our stay at The Flower Pot house. We were continually delighted to find thematic details inside — art, decorations, and dishware, for example — that made the whole package of staying here unique and memorable. Many people who signed the guest book mentioned it was on their Idaho Bucket List. When we visited local stores, those we were in contact with got big eyes and gave us a sense that we were now accepted and special since we are staying at The Flower Pot. In short, staying here is a special experience."

This place is incredibly gorgeous, unique and quaint. From the moment we arrived we just loved it, beautiful ambiance, tastefully decorated and so so cosy for 2.
Do yourself a favour, if only staying one night don’t go out to a restaurant bring takeout or cook out home. It would be such a waste to go out and miss all this little gem has to offer.
We soaked in the outdoor hot tub, cooked on the 2 burner stove top (which was perfectly adequate) listened to records (yes, there’s a record player) drank wine and played board game’s. We’d definitely recommend this place, and we’d give it 10 stars if we could.
Just Perfect, Perfect, Perfect

We noticed extra touches throughout the home, such as extension cords with usb ports, great lighting in all the rooms and a kitchen that was equipped; we were able to cook meals in rather than going out to eat. We played games at the kitchen table and had enough seating in the living room for hanging out together. We loved reading a little about the history of the home. We had one guest that sat down and played the 100 yr old piano; it sounded wonderful!"

This is in a beautiful quiet country setting with easy access to the main road leading to Burley or Oakley. Despite booking last minute, the host welcomed us with kindness and cleanliness. Her flexibility and accommodation, especially with our little ones in tow and some unexpected challenges with them, made all the difference. Keeping quiet hours seemed impossible with one of our kids crying all night, but Alicia was so understanding and kind.
Experiencing life in a cozy RV was a unique adventure in itself! Our kids loved it! We ended up booking another night. It felt like stepping into a home away from home. From the warm bedding and towels to the well-stocked kitchen that had everything we needed.
It was so wonderful and I would definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights",My wife picked this location many months ago when I decided to compete in the Spudman Triathlon. I'll have to say that our weekend stay was incredibly relaxing. Most of the time when we travel for races we stay at hotels. What a wonderful difference this was. The interior was spotless and roomy. We were located in a area where when we looked out the window we saw beautiful farmland with horses and cows. When we needed to go into town it was only a 5-10 minute drive to there or Snake River. The host was outstanding. Before we left my wife and daughter were gleefully picking a few raspberries from the garden. If you are looking for a peaceful getaway then look no further.

Stayed with kids",We loved everything about our stay. so much fun!! The kids had so much fun. I enjoyed the yard. I love sitting out in the sunshine. we were very comfortable in the Trailer. It was in great condition and very well kept. We had everything we needed and we were even offered more pillows or blankets if needed. Thank you so much to our great host's we very much enjoyed our stay it felt warm cozy and very safe. If we go that way again I will be asking to stay in their place. Thank you again!! also they went out of their way to put together the water slide for the kids. They are such a kind family.

Stayed a few nights","This is such a little gem of a place! We have stayed her twice, and it is a perfect basecamp for hanging with friends and family or sightseeing. The kids LOVED the water slide, swings, and trampoline. The bathroom is pretty sizable for a camper, the layout is spacious, and is pretty well stocked (we only used the fridge and didn’t do any food prep). The camper is located just off a quiet country back road, yet close to town. Note: the bunk bed is immediately inside the door to your left. I would recommend the bunks for kids as the mattresses are not very supportive. I slept on the top with the baby and used the extra egg crate mattress topper for added support. All and all, a wonderful and very affordable alternative to staying in a hotel! We will be back!!"

Stayed one night","Alicia's place is a unique camper trailer stay that puts you in a neighborhood feel with a good balance of farm feel just across the street. Mountain sunrise views, a beautiful yard with fruit trees, garden, and games. They're a wonderfully friendly family and very responsive and helpful hosts. I would recommend an easygoing stay here to anyone."

Stayed with kids",Alicia was wonderful! We had a change of plans and she was very accommodating. We woke up and watched the cows in the pasture across the street. It was so peaceful I wish I took a picture. My young son and I had so much playing in their backyard. We’ll be visiting again for sure!

Stayed a few nights",Great place to stay with a very beautiful view of the mountains! Very clean property and RV. Has all the amenities you'll need for a cozy stay! My children especially enjoyed having access to the large yard with all of the playground-style equipment and much more! The host was extremely helpful and even provided us with a bag full of freshly picked produce from her garden! I highly recommend and would stay here again if I were in the area!

Stayed one night","This is by far one of our best Airbnb’s stay. The RV itself is very comfortable and spacious. The fridge was stocked with water and condiments, and the kitchen includes everything you need to prepare meals and coffee. There were fresh towels in the bathroom and a good size shower as well. There’s a nice BBQ and bench outside, with a lovely stream next to the RV, and cows and horses across the street. Although this is not far off a main road with easy access to everything, the house and RV are on a rural street, such a lovely combination. There are clear instructions for the RV’a shower, fireplace, etc. which was very helpful.
The hosts live in a beautiful area. We LOVED the RV. Very comfortable and had everything we needed. We didn’t have the opportunity to enjoy the yard as we were rushed to get on the road but hope to do so in the future. We will definitely stay again! Thank you for such an enjoyable experience!"
