Stayed a few nights","This house was a great option for our medium-sized group. The floorplan gives each sleeping area a somewhat private bath, and there is a lot of inside and outside living area for a group of people. It's also a nice neighborhood with plenty of parking, easily accessible for arriving to town from a couple of directions, and adjacent to some shops when we needed to run out for a couple of errands. Kristina was great to work with and flexible with our arrival."

This house was exactly what this mama needed! The beds were absolutely wonderful, it was decorated beautifully, and there was a playground in the backyard for my kiddos.
This place is a perfect place to stay if your driving across the country and I think it would make a fabulous place to stay a while."

We appreciated the snacks at the table and also the nice cool AC. The house was very clean, had plenty of space for our family of 5 and would have comfortably accommodated more. In the colder months, the fireplace seemed like a nice feature to have. The kids liked the playground in the backyard and spent some time enjoying the patio. We were grateful for the Roku TV which gives any guests a lot of options. Would definitely stay here again."

(leg amputation). Only thing that could make it better is if it was located in the mountains. You can't go wrong here.❤️"

Stayed with kids","Kristina's place is better than the photos! Even though I didn't even chose the place based on the photos, I was just happy to find a place near family in Kansas to visit. It was a very cozy and comfortable and CLEAN feeling. I normally feel a little bit grossed out at Airbnbs or hotels. I normally want to rinse all the dishes off before I use them or not step on the bathroom floor and I didn't have any of those types of feelings at this Airbnb it was so spotless. We especially like the king size cozy bed and all the personal decorative touches. My dad and niece drove down from Plainville for dinner and then they came back in the morning for breakfast and the kitchen had everything that we needed to make food and coffee and the house would have been plenty big enough for them to spend the night if they had chosen to. It even had a little high chair for our 7-month-old. Our favorite part though was the beautiful fireplace"

Stayed a few nights",Our entire group enjoyed our stay at Kristina’s house! Easy access to everything Hays has to offer without the noise. The house is gorgeous and the layout was perfect! It allowed the boys plenty of space to watch football while the girls had enough bathrooms to get ready. Would absolutely book again for a next time we’re in town!

The downstairs was great for movie night as there was no TV glares. The kid friendly dishes were awesome as I wasn't afraid he would drop them. The downstairs gate gave me peace of mind. Overall this was a beautiful home and excellent location for our trip.

Trying to figure out a good half-way point for driving through Kansas, Hays did not disappoint. Really like the, ""no cleaning fee"" strategy. We are always willing and usually strip beds and make it easy to turn over. Last place we rented charged $350 a night , $200 cleaning fee and provided a long list of chores. This was NOT that. Affordable, clean, easy check in. Anyway, really appreciate offering no cleaning fee if you just help out...no problemo!
Hays is a super cute town and we do not hesitate recommending this spot."

I would have felt a little safer if the back door would have had a lock that didn't use a physical key, but that's just my preference being a woman traveling alone. The back yard was covered with snow but it looks like it's a nice place to sit when it's not freezing out. I wiped out and injured my knee on the back doorstep trying to kick the ice away so I could open the door to let my pet out, but other than that it was a good stay. Comfy beds, warm and homey.

Stayed with kids","Very unique house in what appears to be a budding downtown area of Hays. In walking distance of at least 3 trendy breweries/restaurants. House was extremely clean. Beds were comfortable. Strong shower/water pressure. Parking is on the street directly in front of main entry, which is convenient. We have 3 younger kids, so we were a nervous wreck that they were going to break one of the really cool vintage pieces of decor. Luckily, we were only there for the night! The kids did love the step back in time, and enjoyed going to sleep to the sound of 50's love music on the record player. FYI: For those looking to get donuts at the nearby Daylight Donuts, be advised that they only take cash?!? What?! Felt odd to leave an Airbnb (complete digital transaction) to a full cash establishment! Anyways, if you're looking to stay in Hays, STAY HERE. You won't regret it!"

We loved reminiscing about the 60's & 70's, as well as my husband dancing with his 91 year old mom to songs from the 50's playing on an original console phonograph! Super clean and comfortable, Larissa has thought of everything. The fresh eggs were wonderful to have for breakfast, so we had picked up some sausage and English muffins to have with them. She is wonderful to communicate with and check in was super easy. We loved every part of this walk down memory lane! We ate supper at Gella's which was very close and had wonderful food! If you are driving across Kansas, this is a super place to stay! It made our long trip to Colorado very enjoyable!"

Unfortunately the check-in time was at the same time the wedding was to begin. The owner worked with us to get us in a bit earlier and that really saved the day! Plus a good amount of board games available after the wedding so we did family game night. Neighborhood was quiet & peaceful. The only thing I gave 4 stars to is curbside appeal & that's not important to me especially for such a short trip. Huge fenced in backyard as well, just didn't have time to enjoy it!"

Stayed with kids","Pictures show inside well, nicely remodeled but watch your head if you turn on the fan by the bunk bed. Outside has not been renovated yet. Inside temp was 80° when we arrived about dusk. 3 hours later it was only down to 78°. Internet was out, would not reset. Messaged host twice, an hour apart. No response for 3 hours, well after bed time. Response was AC was working properly and nothing could be done about Internet until the next day. Additionally remotes for some lights/fans had dead batteries. Kitchen sink quit working in the morning. It appeared to be battery controlled also so probably more dead batteries. I think it may have just been an unfortunate day for us but it was far from pleasant. Given a profile stating they run dozens of homes, we expected better."

There’s a film across the baseboards and obviously hasn’t had a deep clean for a very long time. Renters do most of the cleaning before they leave. Or you will be charged an outrageous charge.
The kitchen/living area has damaged flooring that can cut and trip.
There’s was decent space to sleep, however the pull out couch had chip crumbs and advil gels caps down in it. It was pretty dirty in there."

Stayed a few nights","Along with a small cleaning fee the guest will be expected to take trash to the bin in the back alley, wipe down counters and fridge if used, wash towels used and strip the bed. Not too much, but it is worth noting so you can plan your departure day accordingly. With a checkout time of 10a there is not much time in the morning to have breakfast, pack up and clean.
The neighborhood leading to this place is nothing fancy, just a basic tidy neighborhood. The exterior of this house reflects the neighborhood as it too needs a little TLC. The interior looks updated, the design is nice. There is a big crack on the kitchen floor, beware of bare feet getting scratched. The cleaning is lacking a little. Maybe I'm picky but it is clear this place needs a deeper clean than it has been getting. Communication with this host was easy. The responses came in a timely manner and were always clear to read. I would consider a revisit at a slightly lower rate or at minimum no cleaning fee."

It was very clean. Super hot water which was excellent. The bunk bed was more like a futon mattress so my son said his back hurt. The ac was not working well at all. It was 69 degrees outside, ac set to 65 and it was 74 inside. With a ceiling fan and my fan I brought along with me I was still sweating while trying to sleep. Made for a very long day today so far. House is convenient to Walmart and fast food. Adam was responsive until I messaged letting him know we were checked out and the ac would never cool down the house. The house is small so it definitely should have cooled quickly."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay on the way home from Colorado. The house is on the outskirts of Hays in a quiet neighborhood. The exterior of the house is a little outdated but what's inside is very cool. It has a fully updated kitchen and a nicely renovated bathroom with three bedrooms. Out of the three bedrooms, two of them are good-size ones and have nice beds, lights, fans, and barn-door closets with extra blankets stored inside. The kid's bedroom is tighter but works for my two sons.
It's cozy enough for my sons to play Battleship while we are cooking dinner and for me to watch TV on the couch afterward while they are getting ready for bedtime. It is truly cheerful."

Group trip",This was a perfect rental for our family during our weekend stay in Hays. It was close to everything. Neighbors were kind and helpful and the house was clean and had ample room for our families to stay in one place. It doesn’t have a ton of kitchen supplies that you find in older Airbnbs but the primary equipment to cook meals is present. We will book again next time we are in town! Great rental!

We felt like ourselves again after our stay which says a lot when you taking a road trip with babies and furry family in tow. The hosts were responsive and the house was neat and beautiful. Next time we are running through the area we will definitely stay here again! Thank you hosts and thank you house!"

Stayed one night","La Casita feels like a warm hug from your grandmother or an old friend! The fixtures are retro and the vibe is warm and inviting. I have stayed at several AirBnB places and this one is a favorite. It is a fully furnished apartment in which one (or two) could be quite comfortable for an extended stay. The bed and linens were very comfy! The neighborhood is quiet and the homes all are well cared for. It is within walking distance to Main Street Hays where one can enjoy a meal, or an art gallery, or visit one of the local shops or the library. I did not meet Erin, but she was flexible and communicated well. I recommend La Casita wholeheartedly!"

We felt right at home and both commented we felt like we were having a sleepover at grandma's- it was just that delightful. Erin has added many thoughtful touches to make for a wonderful stay. The location must be close to train tracks, as I heard it pass by a couple of times in the night. My husband slept right through it, but next time I'll be sure to bring some earplugs. This darling airbnb is an excellent value for the money. Thank you Erin for a lovely stay!"

Stayed with kids","I was surprised upon walking into the apartment to find messy carpets and floors considering the rules stated that all guests should take their shoes off at the door. There was leftover popcorn and other food on the kitchen floor and inside the drawers.
We turned on the heat when we walked in - it had been set to 67, and after a few hours there wasn't much of a change in the temperature. After some back and forth Erin checked the pilot light and it was out. She told us to use the mini splits as a backup heat in case it went out again, which it did. The heat from the mini splits doesn't make it to the bathroom so that was freezing in the morning.
I was hoping for a better alternative to hotels in the area but I wasn't very impressed with the apartment, it was cold and a little rundown."

The Casita was well furnished and stocked with all the things a traveler needs. The bed was very comfortable as was the living room furniture. All the appliances worked flawlessly and the laundry was a very handy extra. The second floor arrangement was not a problem for us, but could be a challenge for travelers with mobility issues."

Hubby and I slept well. The well stocked kitchen offers coffee, tea, powdered creamers, sugar and non sugar packets, hot cocoa, instant oatmeal and popcorn. There were 2 ice trays so I could have ice in my cooler the next day. The space in La Casita is generous and the furnishings and wall decor are unique and thoughtful. I liked the stacked suitcase bedside table and the stacked trunks in the living room. Erin has put together a nice and easy to read notebook of house rules, how things work and check out procedures. Also, she left suggestions for dining out, including 2 discount cards from LA Casita for our use at the place of our choosing. I pickeout many items of interest about KS, off the brochure rack. We hope to come back. Thank you."

The bed was super clean and comfortable, as was the living room furniture. Hooray! (There's nothing worse than booking a cute place only to discover it has a super stiff sofa or a saggy mattress!)
Erin also includes several thoughtful extras, like coffee, tea, spices, basic condiments, feminine products (yay!) and more so you have a few basics covered upon arrival.
The neighborhood is perfect for morning or evening strolls and is also conveniently close to downtown's shopping and dining options, as well as the town's smaller grocery store.
Highly recommend this place for your next trip!"

It was quiet and peaceful the whole time which I really really needed. Great variety of coffees and I loved the milk provided as I use milk in my coffee.

Stayed one night","Erin’s place is so great and I was very excited to stay there. Unfortunately, I had an unforeseen change in plans and was not able to keep my reservation.
But I was very impressed by Erin’s response, communication and patience. She sounds like a genuinely kind and wonderful person! I was very disappointed that I didn’t get to meet her.
I think her listing is very inviting and was perfect for what I was looking for.
I hope to have another chance to stay in Hays and will most definitely reserve her place again, if it’s available."

Stayed a few nights","This was my second stay at Erin's and it was just as great as the first time. It's just really well thought out - every detail has been considered. And you know when you're traveling how it's the little things that make all the difference? She's Queen of the little things. Example: Two fresh eggs in the refrigerator. Who does that? Well, Queen does. :) She just makes it very easy to settle right in and get that small town, Kansas vibe going."

Stayed over a week","I hope there's enough space here to say how grateful we are to Erin for providing this wonderful garage apartment. It was our second time here and everything was perfect-- just like before. It was bitter, bitter cold here the first week and the place was nice and warm, bright, comfy, and a very nice kitchen. Erin went to the trouble to sweep a path in the snow all the way out to our parking spot. And just to make sure we were good and toasty, she dropped off a very nice radiator-style space heater for us to put in the bathroom.
The place is a hop and a half'a skip from FHSU campus where my Wife was attending her classes. It is right near Downtown and all its good restaurants. The neighborhood is gorgeous and nice and quiet. There is a Dillon's grocery store very nearby, and I even got to see a local Farmer I know, David Svaty, when he came to town.
Erin has spoiled us! I seriously can't see why we'd ever stay in a hotel ever again if we can find places like this to stay!"

It was located in a quiet neighborhood and was walkable to the downtown area (though it might be considered a long walk by some). It was also a short drive to other amenities and access to the highway. The host graciously accommodated my last minute request to stay and had the unit ready by the time I rolled in later that evening."

Erin’s attention to detail is nothing like we have experienced in other rentals. There is a coffee maker if you wanna make a pot of coffee, creamer, sugar and also a Keurig! The fridge had little packets of hot sauce and other sauces. The bed is very comfortable! That was especially important because we had come from a rental where the beds were not comfortable and to be able to get a good night’s rest the last leg of our trip was wonderful."

Even my husband, who is not easily impressed, looked around when we left and said, ""Wow. This is a really nice place!"" In short, Erin should be training everyone else how to do it."

Stayed with kids","We typically stay in hotels as we make regular trips from Colorado to Kentucky to visit family, but since adding a second child to the mix we thought that Airbnbs might make packing in and out easier, and perhaps save some strangers in abutting hotel rooms from having to hear the baby wake for feedings in the middle of the night.
It turns out that with a stay like the one we had at Christina's space we got so much more. We had a Pack n' Play waiting for us, Disney+ on the big screen to keep the older child occupied/distracted while we got loaded and unloaded, a much more comfortable bed than we would get at a hotel, and a full kitchen for healthier eating than a hotel breakfast."

The hot shower switch is slightly different ( turn all the way is cold water instead of hot water! )
Front door can get dark and take a while to find the keypad. Once you open the door, it might take sometime to find the switches for the lights. ( No big deals just some notes :) )
The AC ( smart nest ) temperature is locked in to low 70°F.
Would recommend staying here if you need someplace to stay passing by / visiting Hays!
if you need to work before/after checking in/out, Hays public library is nearby and a great place to checkout. ( they renovated the library recently )"

Stayed one night","Julisa's place was exactly as described. It's been recently updated and is decorated nicely. We stayed for one night but her place has everything one would need for a longer stay. Julisa also doesn't ration supplies like some other Airbnb's do. There was lots of TP, towels, cleaning supplies, etc available. It's located on the bricks and is within walking distance to the shops and restaurants in the area. There is a coffee shop right next door which is great but Julisa had specialty coffee for us in her place which was a nice surprise! We've stayed at several Airbnb's in Hays and thought Julisa's was the nicest of them all! Our student has another year of college in Hays so we'll definitely be back if it's available."

Besides, the ac unit switching to heat or completely turning off in the middle of the night, the stay was comfortable"

The decor is so lovely and thoughtful and it's clear she cares about providing quality amenities to her guests (for example, even if you don't need to use one, look at the incredible bowls in the cabinet! gorgeous!). The parking was perfect and the location of the apartment was within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, and even a rooftop bar. I slept really well and didn't want to leave the next morning! One thing to note is that there was a church gathering- or something similar- that I could hear clearly coming from downstairs in the evening. Not sure if this is every night, but it didn't go late or disturb my sleep at all. I highly recommend staying at Julisa's place & I hope to go back sometime!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a small but comfortable place just above the local coffee shop, smack in the middle of the ""city."" Like any in-town place, that's both good and bad. It was great being walking distance to everything, including a bike/walking path just two blocks south; I didn't need my car at all. But the bedroom is very bright at night from streetlights, easily fixable with some blackout curtains; in the meantime, bring eye shades. There was a bit of noise from the other apartments in the building, but overall this was the quietest college town I've visited. Solid place."

Would DEFINITELY stay here again! I wish we had allowed more time to visit the area- in fact, after staying here, we are thinking about returning to KS in the future- and checking to see if the house is available for another stay. We met Brad briefly shortly after we arrived at the end of our looong drive and he was very welcoming, making us feel right at home. Thanks Yvette and Brad!"

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed at their AirBnB on our trip back from the East Coast. And it was so nice to be able to spend time with each other in a homey environment after our long trip.
The first winter blizzard was starting as we were heading out; we had gotten a few recommendations from the locals on our way back into town because of the storm that was being forecasted.
The Hanss Guest House was a blessing in disguise. The beautiful exterior and interior, plus the friendly kind - faces we were greeted with, was exactly what we needed. This place is definitely worth checking out.
Maybe you’ll even find another perfect place to spend time with your significant other, to just relax and recharge things. Plus, there is a cute spot to be able to do laundry together and catch up on work.

Thank you Brad and Yvette for allowing us into your home and giving a safe and warm place while the storm passed through! We truly do appreciate everything.

Stayed one night","We were making a long trip by car across the State and decided early in the day to look for an airbnb location about half way through. Yvette's guest house was perfect for us. Not too far off of the highway and very easy to find, but also tucked away in a quiet, lovely neighborhood with easy access to a great breakfast place (Breathe Cafe) and a clean, quaint downtown. Hays does a great job of restoring and maintaining historical architecture, and we enjoyed walking around after breakfast. The guest house was larger than we expected, with a super comfortable bed and everything we needed to make a simple dinner and coffee the next morning, which we sipped on the quaint front porch. The interior was relatively new, spotless, and comfortable, and our hosts were friendly and accommodating. We will keep this place in mind for future trips into central/western Kansas and beyond!"

Stayed a few nights","My spouse and I have each been using Airbnb (& other private-lodging platforms) for a long time. We both came away feeling that our stay at Yvette's guest house was by far the most positive experience we've ever had.
The cupboards are fully stocked with any serveware, cookware, and small appliances you could conceivably need for a longer stay. The place is spotless enough to eat off the floor, but homey enough that you don't feel like you can relax and make it your temporary nest. The king-sized bed was a dream, and was outfitted with great linens and pillows (there were lots of backup sheets and blankets had we needed them).
It was the most immaculate home and easy stay I've ever encountered. I'm so appreciative of the serene and beautiful space she's created for travelers like us. I hope we get to visit again; I didn't realize how lovely Hays is and would love to explore more. This home is the perfect springboard for that. Lots of great tiny touches."

Extremely clean unit. Kitchen was well-stocked with gadgets and other kitchenware to fix your own food.
This unit far exceeded our expectations!
If you have small kids, allow for sometime at the nearby ARC playground and splash pad."

She even had a box fan (seriously this ups my stars by at least one each time!) Plenty of everything including coffee, creamer and shampoo/conditioner (all things I always forget to pack).

She pretty much thought of every convenience one would need: extra blankets & towels, board games (adult & children), pack & play & high chair if needed (we did not), video gaming capability. The kitchen was well stocked with most items one would need. She provided recommendations for some really good restaurants. We are very hopeful that Yvette’s home will be available the next time we come through Hays. It was a very restful time!"
