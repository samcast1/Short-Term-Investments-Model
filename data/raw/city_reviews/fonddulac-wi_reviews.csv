Stayed a few nights","Joe's place is absolutely beautiful, inside and out. The space has clearly been recently remodeled and is in immaculate condition. The photos don't do it justice. There's tons of space to hangout in the kitchen/dining/living room if you have a larger group of people and the bedrooms are both spacious and extremely comfortable. The property itself is directly on the lake with a large pier, great to take in sunrise/sunset and do some fishing! Joe himself was responsive, friendly and accommodating - he went above and beyond."

Stayed a few nights","My partner & I stayed here over New Years with two other friends, and we all loved it. The Airbnb was very clean, with modern appliances, and a very comfortable living space. It offers a wonderful view of Lake Winnebago from both the living area & the bedrooms, and it is located in a quiet lakeside neighborhood just outside of Fond du Lac. Communication with the owner was great. We had a wonderful weekend getaway together - would recommend!"

Beautiful location right on Lake Winnebago and nice flat lot with a pier and bench you can sit on an just enjoy the sound of the water around you. Inside, you could not ask for more! Three huge bedrooms- very beautifully decorated. Amazing kitchen with a large island and table that seats 8. And everything you could possibly need, Joe had stocked! Even better than home! Three full baths was great. And, as a host, Joe was extremely responsive, helpful and friendly. We had a great time and hope to rent this property again."

There was lots of room to be together but the house also allowed for private moments. Although the weather was not as cooperative as we had hoped, there were plenty of streaming options on the TV and a great table for playing games. (We also loved the ice machine and determined that we would love to have one of these in each of our homes if we could figure out a place to put it.) Thank you, Joe, for sharing your lovely, welcoming home!"

I have always loved older homes, and this one did not disappoint, full of nooks and crannies that we had fun exploring. Beautiful woodwork everywhere. The home is immaculate, beds super comfortable. The only downside is there is only one shower and with 6 women staying, it was a struggle; however, well worth it. Can’t wait to stay there again!"

Group trip","We had a family gathering at the house to visit an ill brother. It was a charming, old (124yr.) homey place to stay. Comfortable, clean and perfect for a family stay of six adults. The description was accurate. The host was friendly and responsive. We spent all of our time at the house and cooked all our meals there. The kitchen was stocked well except no measuring cups or spoons.
On arrival the house was 53 degrees downstairs with a faulty digital thermostat. It was even colder upstairs. We called the host and after trying to troubleshoot over the phone he sent over a Mr. Fixit who got the furnace going. The next day Mr. Fixit returned as the upstairs was still too cold. The next two nights were comfortable for all. We appreciated the host's prompt response, the requested space heater for the coldest upstairs room and the offer by the host of a refund for the first night's stay.
We would stay at this home again but probably not in winter!"

Stayed a few nights","I had the chance to visit this place during end of summer, the outside of the house gives you a feeling of been on the middle of the woods for been surrounded by trees and nature, squirrels and rabbitts are often found around.
The kitchen is full with everything you might need for basic or more comples dishes like desserts, and more than plenty silverware and dishes for big families and of course everything works properly.
The warm days were not an issue with the AC central which cools pretty good the whole house, and it is quiet perfect so do not disturb with noise. (I am a very sensible person for noises during sleep so this is something I always consider), and during days no so warm, I was able to sleep without AC with the windows opened and the street is very quiet so this is also another option.
All furniture at the whole house is good quality, at bedrooms, living room,with a massive TV at living room perfect to watch family movies, this place is amazing, I did not miss home he"

It is located in a neighborhood with some beautiful newer upscale houses. This house is quite large with lots of space to gather in the living room area and also in the 2 porches which I think are the 3 season kind. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of towels. The kitchen was well stocked but if you need something specific you may want to check with Pat the owner before you come. It also has a huge beautiful yard with plenty of shade and lawn chairs. Pat was very responsive and check in was beyond easy.

Our boys loved the water bike, paddle board, kayaks and ping pong table. Pat provided charcoal for the grill and firewood for a bonfire so all we had to do was bring our groceries and settle in! If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely check to see if the beach house is available."

Of course, the beach was where we spent much of the days — our two year old had the time of his life digging in the sand and wading around (sand toys are provided). There’s an incredibly large back yard that’s nicely shaded for breaks from the water. Pat was easy to communicate with and answered all of our questions right away. Highly recommended in every regard."

When swimming, it is shallow for a while so great for kids to have a lot of area to play in where they can easily stand. The rear porch was awesome - open the windows and feel the breeze off the lake. The ping pong table was a hit as well. Pat was a wonderful host - very quick communication and very nice in person as well (he lives next door). Neighbors were all very nice - went for a walk to the end of Sandy Beach Rd and each person we ran into was friendly. Would highly recommend to anyone - especially for families."

The house was very clean and Pat and his daughter Meg were very hospitable. The owner lives next door and is very nice. Even allowed us to check out a bit later due to a schedule conflict on our end. The private beach with kayaks, paddleboard and waterbike with life jackets provided the perfect outdoor entertainment. When the sun set, we enjoyed an outdoor fire by the lake. Indoors, the house is equipped with games and a ping pong table! We turned the TV on only once while there. If you are looking for the perfect beach house, this is it. Outside of the owner's control are the vicious mosquitoes. Bring repellent. We look forward to returning. Thank you Pat."

Did enjoy both the porches. It is located in a real nice area on a dead end road. Neighbors are close, but we felt like we had our privacy the entire time. Go for a walk and everyone you see is friendly. The place has a sandy beach (big plus) which is actually rare on lake Winnebago. One thing about the lake though is that it can be either crystal clear or it can algae up pretty bad. It is swimmable with mild algae, BUT be sure to shower and clean your suit afterwards. Great Host, will attend to any needs you may have. In the area be sure to check out some of the local Supper Clubs, have a great Wisconsin ""old fashion"", and if you like ice cream try Kelly's creamery."

The property is beautiful and provides easy access to friendly neighbors and the beautiful lake which is perfect for children of all ages! They provided kayak's and a paddleboard which are an excellent addition to the activities we were able to enjoy. My son, 5, found the beach toys that were also provided. We feel wonderful knowing the many other things we didn't have to purchase or pack in order to enjoy ourselves, it was all provided for us! We enjoyed cooking out on the grill and sitting by the fire while gazing into the beautiful sunset. We will certainly be looking forward to booking with Pat and his family for another 4th of July vacation and possibly many more! We can't thank the family enough for providing us with a very special 4th of July parade, good conversations and getting to know the family as well as the very friendly neighbors."

Every aspect of the Airbnb, from the decor to the amenities, has been carefully thought out. Staying here feels like a home away from home, thanks to the cozy furnishings and thoughtful touches throughout the space. The location of this Airbnb is perfect – close to all the attractions yet tucked away in a peaceful neighborhood, offering the best of both worlds.
The host goes above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay, providing clear communication, helpful tips, and even some extra treats upon arrival. You can tell the host genuinely cares about their guests' experience."

It was easy to get to the grocery store and we walked to dinner at Schmitty's. The kitchen had everything we needed when we did cook. The giant television and massage chair were definite perks! Overall, a wonderful place in a great location. Would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I don't know about you but I don't like being lied to.
1.) Dishwasher was untruthfully listed as an amenity ( It was one of the reasons that I chose this property.. I wanted a few days away w/o doing dishes )
2.) Look at the listing's picture of ""Room 1""... See the tiny nightstand table to the left of the bed?.. Danielle threw a mouse pad on it.. No Chair .. added a couple of outlets and called it a "" Dedicated Work Station/Desk"".. Another Falsification
3.) I tried to give her a chance to redeem herself by asking about a toaster... She was completely unhelpful and told me to try baking bread in the oven with the listing's Included baking sheet.. Only problem
4.) No BAKING SHEET! .. (unless you include the unwashed drip pan I found below the oven.. Another lie.
Danielle is NOT a ""Super""Host.. She is more like a landlord who only wants your money and your silence.
I think she's over her head. She lives an hour away so if your a guest your on your own.
PS.. I bought her a toaster."

Group trip","This was exactly what we were hoping for in a lake getaway. I imagined that I had a relative who agreed to let my family use their lake house. This was cozy, personal, and had everything we needed. The host had prepared everything with so many thoughtful touches for us. The kitchen was very nicely equipped. The living areas were comfy and cozy. The bathrooms had everything, including lots of towels. The kayaks and bikes provided with the rental were a lot of fun. And the location is beautiful, whether on the lake, the shore, in the amazing hot tub, or walking /biking in the neighborhood. I really hope we have the opportunity to return and enjoy it again."

From the hooks in every closet for your bags, to the bird watching book and binoculars by the lake facing floor to ceiling windows; this home checked every box.

The house has a beautiful lakeside charm with some nice updates to make it super comfortable and the kitchen is well appointed with every thing you need. There is plenty of eating and relaxing space for everyone, and a lovely deck out back to watch the sunrise or sunset from. It's close to pretty much everything in FDL. I would definitely recommend staying here any time of the year, you can't beat a stay on the lake!"

Group trip","I want to give Tanya's place 10 out of 5 stars. The place was beautiful, spacious, and clean. Tanya was responsive and so accommodating throughout the whole process, honestly could not have asked for a better host. The place is so much bigger than one would expect and everyone fit comfortably with the four bedrooms, shared spaces, and the beautiful sunroom. Outside was like a painting, you can tell they care for the property so well and its one of those places you can just relax and look out with a cup of coffee. The house was also super stocked with beverages, coffee, towels, q-tips, cleaning supplies - basically everything that you would need and more. Plenty around the area as well if you are looking for good food or drinks.
Thank you so much Tanya, it was a wonderful ending to the summer to stay at your house and hope we can come back again."

Above all, despite my sweeping the property for any of our belongings before we left, Michael contacted me to let me know that he found a small jewelry box left by my daughter. I greatly appreciate his honesty and him quickly reaching out to make me aware. I was able to meet him at the property to retrieve it. Michael is beyond a 5 star host and the property is just darling. I would definitely stay again in the future."

It's a shame we didn't get to enjoy the lake as much as we'd like to, due to time constraints. The host, Michael, was very helpful, proactive, and responsive. Since we were driving for about 8 hours, I was worried we might be late for check-in, but he assured us that it was flexible and not to worry about being a bit late. The place was very clean and has it's own water dispenser. We also had privacy in the form of thick, accordion blinds. The coolest part of the place, imo, was the light dimmer switches, since we don't have them at our place."

Stayed over a week","We needed an extended option in the FDL area to be with a failing relative. Michael was able to provide that for us. We were surprised and delighted that our ""room"" was really a small quaint cottage on the shore of Lake Winnebago. I was able to use the second bedroom as a kind of office to Zoom with others. The cottage is about 5 miles out of town and allowed us a quiet and beautiful spot to chill. The cottage was very clean and had all the kitchen amenities for us to ""move"" right in. I'll be back. If you're looking for a signature Friday fishfry, try baked walleye at Gino's."

Stayed a few nights","Michael's cottage was perfect for our trip to Wisconsin. I grew up nearby and wanted a place convenient to visiting family members. The cottage is charming and very comfortable. Being able to sip morning coffee while watching ducks paddling in the small area of still open water on the lake was a wonderful way to begin our days. Michael was a superb host, quick to reply and accomodating of our needs. I highly recommend staying here. We hope to revisit during warmer weather. ."

There is a private dock but nothing we were able to use for our pontoon, however the host was gracious in helping us find alternative overnight parking for our boat and trailer. Whether you're looking for a relaxing view or a great place to stay during your next fishing adventure I'd happily recommend this place!"

The property is beautiful, the views peaceful and spectacular, the house large and roomy and clean and cozy (with lots of spaces to bring people together), and the kitchen is unreal.
Things you might like: (1) watching the sunrise from the dock (which has a little bend in it to make sure it faces directly East); (2) kayaking on the lake; (3) renting a jet ski from the nearby rental marina; (4) watching a movie with oven pizza after spending a day at the beach on Lake Michigan (Kohler Andrae State Park is perfect); (4) a big family dinner; (5) time at the campfire after dinner; (6) the EAA aviation museum in Oshkosh; (7) lots of groceries and services nearby (< 10 min); (8) having five bedrooms so everyone can be alone when they need to be; (9) so much more."

The only bummer for us was the 10am checkout time.. it was challenging to get all 10 of us up and ready, pack up all of our things, wash and dry the towels, etc. all before 10am. An 11am checkout would have made it a perfect stay! Thanks for having us!"

The backyard was small, but has a tall fence for your pup's privacy. The owner's suite is spacious for the age of the house, and the balcony was a nice extra for enjoying the night air. Orlena was quick to respond, polite, and courteous. Definitely would stay again."

The house is very comfortable, especially the sofa. It is beautifully and simply decorated. Loved the size of the dining table. The laundry room is located on the main level (not in the basement), and is huge, which is a plus. The bedrooms upstairs were all a good size and not cluttered with too much furniture, and the beds were very comfortable. There was plenty of closet space and loved the mirrors on the closet doors. There are two bathrooms upstairs and a half bath in the laundry room.
The kitchen is a good size, with a large refrigerator, oven range, dishwasher, microwave and walk-in pantry.
we very much enjoyed our stay and would stay again if it is available next year!"

Nestled right in the heart of downtown, you’re only a few mins drive away from local attractions. Lakeside Park was fun for the whole family and the children’s museum is nearby. Next door to the loft is a nice German pub with excellent food and drink. A short drive away is Schmitty’s Pub which is a must to dine. As for the loft itself, it’s tastefully done and has everything you would need. Street meter parking right outside. 2Hr limit regardless if it’s fed by coin on through an app but super inexpensive. $1 gets you two hours. Weekends are free. If we’re ever in the Fond du Lac area again I’m for sure going to look up this unit to see if it’s available! Cheers!"

Stayed one night","This is a very unique rustic cabin on 30 acres of land. The cabin is clean and inviting. It is more of a house than just a cabin in terms of amenities, with cabin flavor and everything made of wood and stone. Nadine is a very welcoming hosts, going out of her way to make her guests comfortable. Despite the no-pets condition, she did not object to us bringing our cat. We found plenty of bottled water in the refrigerator, a bottle of crispy pinot grigio, and even a bottle of non-alcoholic win for out 16 y.o. This was a nice surprise! Nadine encouraged us to do a campfire in her big firepit and generously provided us with wood. Midnight campfire was definitely a highlight of our short trip, our son was very happy. Next day Nadine had no problem with our late checkout. We definitely will consider to come back to Nadine's cabin and we recommend it to anyone looking for a place in the area."

From the unique, piece-of-art stone fireplace to the mixtures of woodwork to the pretty, comfortable furniture to the many artistic displays of antiques, this place was lovingly decorated and a feast for the eyes. I especially liked the houseplants. The outdoor gathering spaces, the yard and gardens were lovely. Everything was taken care of including the groovy coffee station. If you are a coffee lover, I want to mention that you might want to bring a coffee pot. We brought our own (special) coffee, but there is only a Keurig machine available. My husband drinks a lot of coffee and I personally don't like 1-serving cups due to the waste, so we prefer a whole pot. However, the coffee was great and easy to make. The location is convenient, right off the highway, but once you're there it seems quiet and secluded. We really enjoyed exploring the place and the creative, relaxing atmosphere. We'd love to stay again!"

My friends and I spent two nights here and absolutely loved the stay. Nadine has decorated the space with lot of plants and antique collectibles. We did a bonfire on both night and Nadine even provided the logs and lighter fuel. We managed to spot a couple of deers on the property as well :)
I would highly recommend Nadine’s place for your stay."

The place is lovely, super clean, super comfortable, she had toiletries to use, a s’mores kit for us, and firewood. The kitchen was big and functional and the beds are comfortable. Easy drive into Fond Du Lac and to the lake, and we had a lot of fun enjoying the peace and quiet of her cabin and surrounding property on our weekend getaway from the city. We’ll be back! Thanks Nadine!"

Stayed one night","If I could give this place 6 stars I would. I could not even comprehend that this place was even available when we booked it. There were lovely blackberry and raspberry bushes that were delicious, the host greeted us and was so friendly, she got extra soap and toiletries, the house was freaking GORGEOUS (if you love plants you have to see how beautiful it is in person), there was complimentary wine, a fire pit, and literally everything you could need for a great night. Not to mention you are allowed to make as much noise as you want for as long as you want without bothering anyone. It was incredible. We went to a goat creamery the day after and a scenic overlook. On the way to the place lake kettle-moraine is super fun. We will be coming back. College kids looking for a place to get away for a weekend this is a MUST and literally the best value I think I have ever gotten from an airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","We just returned from a 2 night stay at Nadine's. When we pulled up to the house, we were beyond delighted. The house is nestled between 3 fields of corn rows and capped with a gorgeous oak tree and flower gardens, making it a truly hidden treasure. You're surrounded by garden beds, rows of raspberry bushes and a pumpkin patch.
Nadine greeted us, and gave us a tour of the home, which is built around an old stone fireplace. The architecture is such a warm and inviting bit of history, and the space is filled with comfortable seating and a kitchen filled with all the essentials for cooking. During the tour Nadine shared some great stories about the home, which we loved.
There is a huge fire pit outside that we used on Friday (because the rest of the weekend forecast was rain), and firewood was available to purchase. We also made the most of the weather and ate our dinner outside on the picnic table. You're very conveniently located to restaurants (We had an old fashioned at Jim & Linda's Supper Club and can't wait to try it again for dinner).
The bed was very comfortable, but we spent most of our time in the kitchen, making meals, having wine and enjoying all the weather (even the non stop rain). Our favorite moment was Saturday night after the rain slowed down, and we walked around the grounds at dusk. I have never seen as many fireflies at one time as I did last night. It was magical.
We appreciated the small details made to ensure our comfort, and have already checked our scheduled to see if we can make another stay.
One thing to note, there is a renter who stays in the garden level of the home. They are not there often, and we briefly met them in passing a few times and they are delightful. We only mention this because you can hear one another.
In any case, we hands down are looking forward to renting the home again, and can't wait to be there again!"

We enjoyed the park in the downtown area with the kids, the swimmable lake half hour away, and the house with all comforts of home but with a country feel."

Stayed a few nights","Everything was labeled so it was easy to find items, all throughout the house. She was VERY welcoming. There are 2 reasons I gave 4 stars instead of 5. 1. Greeted us upon arrival to introduce herself and see if we had any questions (lives next door). It was after 10pm, so it was kinda late after a long day of traveling. 2. I had wanted her to turn down the A/C a little so it could cool down the house before arrival. Which she did with no hesitation, BUT the room we slept in, the vent was closed AND had a mat covering it. We weren't aware until last day because it was hidden under the bed. We just thought we had no A/C upstairs. Oh well.... Otherwise, everything was peaceful, clean, helpful, and relaxing! Thanks for everything Bonnie! We will be sure to recommend you to others!"

This house is well stocked, super clean, and convenient to highways, restaurants, grocery store, gas station, and the like. The internet is a bit slow but we were told that upon arrival. Bonnie was an excellent host. She was very flexible when we arrived earlier than expected and gave us a tour when we arrived. There was even a space in the garage for us to park which is super helpful in the winter when loading up three small kids. We’ll definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!"

Spotless, organized, spacious, and a great location. The home is wonderfully equipped with every possible detail attended to. Fully stocked with necessities, and just easy and carefree to be in, which is so great when traveling. The home is quiet and everything is high quality. Bonnie, the owner, is a marvel at organizing keeping the place perfect for her guests, and is a wonderful person. Not a single issue or even a tiny nit to pick. Couldn't be a nicer place to stay."

Bonnie provided all of the amenities we could possibly need, and drawers and cabinets are helpfully labeled.

Group trip","Tweetys Airbnb is a great place to stay for an outing in Fond Du Lac. We rented it for a weekend small family get together... with 3 bedrooms we had 3 siblings and one spouse so it worked perfectly. The house was immaculately cleaned. It is in a quiet neighborhood which is close to retail and restaurants, and about 2 miles at most from I-41 exit. I would say that this is the best supplied Airbnb I have ever been in, and I have rented in the USA and Europe over many years. I cannot think of anything that was missing and the owner conveniently puts small notes on drawers and cabinets with what is in them. I was not aware the property is actually a duplex, as the picture looks more like a free standing home. But it is a type of duplex townhome and the owner lives on the other side. Bonnie was polite and kept her distance. She also was excellent in communication responding almost immediately to questions I asked. Bonnie is serious about Covid so I assure you the place is about as clean and safe as it can be. I recommend this for a small family or a few siblings, friends to get together."

Bonnie met us when we arrived to go over everything in detail.
Pros of the duplex:
Very clean
Two of the rooms have large walk in closets.
The air conditioning works very well.
There were plenty of supplies.
Cons:
The water is very hard. This was my main reason for only giving it 4 stars.
The air mattress in the 3rd bedroom is very uncomfortable and I consider it to be low quality.
The pillows are uncomfortable.
The hair dryer is low quality. You might want to bring your own.
There are no mirrors in the house besides the bathrooms."

Stayed a few nights","Tweety's place was wonderful (thanks Bonnie!) for the hospitality on our trip out to Fond Du Lac! Your place was just right for our needs and was great in terms of location and convenience. Bonnie's place was super clean, easy to use (thanks for all the labels!), and convenient to check in and out (thanks for the flexibility on Sunday!). We'll definitely consider this great townhouse again when we return (which will probably be sooner than later). Bonnie is very nice, easy to work with and quick to communicate. I can't recommend her place highly enough."

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there are two full bathrooms which was very helpful for everyone getting ready at the same time. Bonnie has clearly put a lot of thought into labeling things and providing instructions to make things as simple as possible for her guests. She even helped us out with a request to print train tickets. We would definitely stay again!"

We were in town for hockey and the home is less than 5 minutes from the rink so the location worked really well. Bonnie’s home is very clean and had everything we needed including a fully stocked kitchen so we were able to cook all of our meals for the weekend. Bonnie is very accommodating and went above and beyond with anything we needed. I had forgot a booster high chair for my 1 year old and she went right home and got us one to borrow for the weekend! We will definitely stay again if we are in the area.

Stayed a few nights","Tweety's (or, Bonnie's Beautiful Airbnb as we affectionately referred to it while we stayed) was AMAZING! She is a gracious hostess, the house immaculate and the amenities: well, let me just say, they have thought of everything.
We were warmly greeted. The house is clean, tidy and well organized. Very comfortable with plenty of pillows, towels and amenities. The media room table has folders with local menus, tips and tourist attractions. We were in town for a loved one in the hospital and if we had been on pleasure instead (or, had time), we would have loved to sit on the front porch with a glass of wine; or, in the backyard (which has raised garden beds) and a glass of ice tea. It was very relaxing. Bonnie also recommended a restaurant for us as well and was spot on!
Honestly, the BEST Airbnb we have ever stayed in."

Stayed with a pet","Great stay I encourage anyone wanting a lake vacation to stay here. I stayed during the winter so I can't say anything about lake amenities but the view of the lake is gorgeous especially from upstairs in the bedroom on the chaise lounge! I traveled with my 8week infant yes but brought everything I needed for her. I also traveled with two well trained medium dogs, that are used to travel and behave. This was a business trip but I have to say the Italian food in fond du lac is amazing! It's my favorite part when staying in this town. From the location of being close to good food and the gorgeous lake I would love to stay here again. I would suggest with anyone traveling with a dog to bring a kennel if your dog isn't used to being alone in an unknown place so you don't damage the good property that is allowing dogs it's still pretty rare to find accommodating places to stay with dogs so don't ruin this one. ❤️ wonderful little get away we had despite being here for my husband's work 5/5!"

Since we like to cook most of our meals we enjoyed the kitchen, and even made an apple pie. We were allowed to pick apples from the tree. We wanted a place to relax, read and watch movies. I would have liked a dvd player since we don't use Netflix or other options on the TV. We should have noticed the amenities better, including that the house was not walkable to activities. Loved the sauna and backyard the most. The description should mention that the sauna is in the basement (no hand railing). I need to use a cane and it was a little challenging to get downstairs and to climb the front steps. Questions sent to Brian were quickly answered, a great plus. Thanks for being a great host."

We stayed here for eaa air venture and would absolutely stay again. This is also the only bnb I’ve stayed in I was allowed to park my truck in the garage which was extremely nice during the nasty storms we had during our stay. Can’t wait to come back!"

We enjoyed our stay other than a couple problems... sulfur smelling water, and 2 showers that couldn't regulate temperature. We were the first guests in the home and Brian assured us that he would fix the problems. Sounds like the next guests were happy so hopefully that means it's all good now.
One other FYI, if it is really windy something rattles loudly outside. So either plan your visit on calm days or bring earplugs!😊"

I feel at home at the house with beautiful surroundings of green nature. I love the cats, too. They make me smile everytime. 😊 When I check in, Mr Will helped me to move the stuff up to my room when he met me. I really appreciate that. Ms Pam helped me with the wifi connection right away which I feel really good about their fast response.
I did have a good , calm, and peaceful time at this beautiful white house on the hill. If you have a business that you have to stay in FDL for a short time, I highly recommend them! The price is good in the area, too."

Check in and out was easy and parking was available while I was there. I wish I could stay longer to explore the area. The room was cozy, but I don’t think there is AC there, only the fans, so it can get warm if the temp outside is higher. The other areas in the house is actually cooler, so if you book other rooms it should be fine."

Stayed a few nights","This was my second Airbnb experience and it was amazing. I felt like I was transported to a vacation home in Colorado when I entered the quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Yet the location turned out to have easy access to dining, grocery stores, Starbucks, and my work-All of these were just a few short minutes away. The home was located atop a modest slope tucked-in a heavily wooded area just on the edge of Fond Du Lac.
Pamela and Belinda were fantastic hosts. Belinda was there to greet me at the door and gave me a quick tour of this amazing home. I felt like I was in a luxury mansion beautifully decorated throughout. The backyard had a relaxing area in the back of the home with a serene fountain that transitioned gracefully into the treeline.
The Kennedy Loft was perfect for me and exceeded my expectations for a loft area. It looked like a newly remolded area that served as a cozy hideaway from the worries of the day. A large tv with accompanying remote was available in the loft along with a fan that I used sparingly during my lengthy stay. There was a more private sitting area just below my loft with a mini-refrigerator, Kuerig coffee machine, and requisite k-cups. Bottled water was thoughtfully restocked in the mini-fridge. I had space to store a few items to tide me over. Although this area was available to other guests in the home, I found it available and quiet when I wanted to get some work I wanted to get done for the next day.
I had minor difficulty logging into the wifi and in less than 3 minutes, Pamela responded via text and Belinda was sitting across from me diligently working on my question.
I would say this was an excellent experience in a beautiful resort style home with many beautifully decorated areas to concentrate, relax, or just enjoy the zen of where you are. I highly recommend Belinda and Pamela for their thoughtful, considerate, client-centered approach to guaranteeing a flawless stay. They will give you space to do your thing (which I prefer) or engage in pleasant conversation as I did with Belinda over some comfort food one evening.
I actually am going back very soon for another lengthy stay related to my work. That's recommendation enough.
Thank you

Stayed a few nights","Emma House is cozy, cute, safe, and convenient. I stayed two nights with two friends and we had a lovely time. The host was communicative and the place was ready for us with clean linens and towels, all the necessary kitchen stuff (including some wonderful coffee - bonus points!) and plenty of places to sleep comfortably.
The neighborhood is safe and quiet, and we were able to easily find Uber drivers to take us anywhere we wanted to go. It's also walking distance from Main Street, about 25 minutes to get to the farmer's market, cafes, etc. It was just perfect :)
We couldn't be happier with this rental, highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Caryn’s place was great to stay at. Everything was so clean and in pristine condition. This is by far the cleanest AirBnB I have ever stayed at. It was so easy to feel comfortable there and a great place to stay with a full kitchen and comfortable beds.
Caryn was also quick to respond and very accommodating."

Stayed with kids","Thank you to Morgan and her family for allowing my family to stay in their lovely, well-kept home. As soon as we got in, my children and I felt welcomed. The house was very spacious and perfectly accommodating for little kids. Lots to do and play with as toys were left to be used and kept easily for reorganization. The immediate area was lovely and the neighborhood was familiar to home. Neighbors were very nice. The local area had lots of dining and shopping nearby also. Overall, the home was well kept and clean. Great space available for multiple guests. Huge fenced in back yard for outdoor activities!
I would highly recommend this Airbnb home! Thanks for sharing your home with my family.

Stayed with a pet",This was a lovely home in a very nice neighborhood. The home was well laid out and clean. The big fenced in yard was great for our two dogs. The big deck was also a nice place to sit and relax. We never stayed anywhere that was so well stocked with kitchen supplies. The big TV and variety of viewing options was great for relaxing at night. It's so nice to stay somewhere that feels like home. We would like to thank the military family for sharing their home and for their service to our country.
