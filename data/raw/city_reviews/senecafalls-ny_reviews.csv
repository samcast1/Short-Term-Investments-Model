I plan to return to this home with my husband later in the summer. Seneca Falls has so much history, and this visit we were aiming only at seeing the total solar eclipse"

The house was beautiful and just what we were looking for in an Air BNB! My friend had never stayed at an Air BNB before and I think this changed her mind for future trips! Thank you Jaime and Todd!

Stayed a few nights","Jaimie and Todd were able to offer us another place nearby, when the place we choose had an unexpected problem. They were able to have the problem fixed at our 1st choice place by our scheduled arrival date. Thank you.
The apartment was as shown on the website, and the note on the blackboard was a pleasant surprise. The neighborhood was generally quiet. Dan loved the grapes that were growing in the backyard. The stairs up to the porch door were a little rickety. Thank you for the Kcups and chips. The TV was easy to navigate, but had one problem with the sound. Dan turned off the TV and started it again, which restored the sound. One minor inconvenience was the lack of the bathroom sink stopper lift handle.

We were provided with water and snacks in the kitchen, plenty of towels in the bathroom, and a very comfortable bed with linens provided.

We enjoyed Watkins Glen, and state parks that were located about 50 min away. There were also very nice wineries and breweries in that area.
It is my fault for not reading the listing but we went with one other couple and there are three rooms and two have single beds. So my husband and I slept in separate rooms which was fine but something to keep in mind if you go with another couple.
We enjoyed our stay !"

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable and spacious apartment close to downtown. The canal and main commercial center of Seneca Falls are within walking distance and the building is right on one of the main arteries leading to both Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, so wine trails and lake/park activities are an easy ride in either direction. I did not spend much time in the apartment since I was only in town for a wedding but the place seemed like it would be a nice home base for anyone planning a longer stay. The kitchen was sizable and the apartment can easily sleep 5; the futon is even in its own room/office, separate from the living room. Would stay here again."

Comfortable living room for games, TV, or nice conversations. Well appointed eat-in kitchen. Location is only a block or two from the center of town - definitely worth a walking tour. We wouldn't hesitate to return to this one."

The location is great too. Just a short walk to a small business strip and a quick drive to a few state parks!
While it was just me this house would be comfortable for a trip with a few friends.
Will absolutely return again on my next trip to the finger lakes!"

Stayed a few nights","Charming upstairs apartment in a central area to explore the Finger Lakes region. Very clean & comfortable. The historic home is on a busy main street, so traffic noise is nearly constant. A white noise machine or phone app helps. (FYI for light sleepers) We visited in off-season for an extended weekend and discovered many restaurants, wineries and museums closed or on reduced hours...but still found great places visit with research & planning. Hosts have a big collection of travel brochures which really helped us plan our days! We really enjoyed Connie's Diner & Penny's Restaurant breakfast, & grabbed picnic supplies at Sauder's Store for a day exploring Watkins Glen. We enjoyed the wineries in the upper Seneca Lake/Cayuga Lake region the most...just 15 minutes from Lake to Lake! Be sure to try the cheese tasting at Murano Cheese too. Had a great visit to the area, stopped at Letchworth State Park (1.5 hours west) on our way back home...perfect end to our trip! Thanks for a great visit...we were unsure about covid-era travel but the house put us at ease!"

No time to visit the Wonderful Life museum.. so we must return. This is one of the best places we have ever stayed at. My only gripe is that the windows don’t open, and I sleep with the open usually.

Stayed a few nights","Had a lovely stay here in downtown Seneca Falls. It’s a second floor walk up with a private entrance. There are two other units in the building. If you are a light sleeper, you may hear the other guests or the traffic passing by on the surprisingly busy street. Nothing terrible, but noticeable if that’s the kind of thing that bothers you. Also shades are on all the windows, but you will get some light coming through. So bring a eye shade if you need blackout conditions for optimal sleep. Very clean, lots of space, and comfortable— the beds are that kind of memory foam/ tempur pedic mattress that many people find so comfortable.
Very close to the historical sites of downtown and the restaurants that made our stay quite enjoyable."

Darryl’s place was an accidental find that worked perfectly for what we needed. We all got to spend quality time, watch the PGA Championship together and enjoy downtown Seneca Falls. Darryl was a fantastic host who made our stay extremely easy. With instructions and pics it was easy to find. We were pleased to see that the place was large enough that we each had personal space. Darryl even left snacks and kcups! Pac-Man was a big hit for our nephew and the restaurants and shops on the same block were a huge plus for the adults. Thanks Darryl! I hope we can stay again during our next visit."

The area was very nice, walkable, with excellent restaurants, and pubs. Would have appreciated a little later check out time. We had to scramble to take care of the household duties and get out by 10 am, but doable. The cleaning fee on top of the rental fee was a little high, but this isn't the 1st Airbnb we've encountered like this. Really don't think anyone could go wrong staying at this listing."

For others that may bring a dog, it might be helpful to know that you have to walk about 100 yards to get to the green space, it isn’t right outside the door. We enjoyed the games, the view, the fun decor and the proximity to a variety of activities!

Darryl was responsive to any questions that I had prior and during our stay. He even offered a high chair and pack and play for my 8 month old. There is free parking in the back of building with rear access which made it pretty convenient to transport groceries from the super Walmart that’s only a 5 minute drive away.
Overall this was a great stay and we are excited to return in the near future!"

We had plenty of room to work without feeling cramped and the location is perfect. Truly appreciated that checkout was easy and didn’t require 2 hours of prep. Of all the airbnbs I’ve stayed in over the years, this is definitely a top 10 find. Bonus that the mattresses are some of the most comfortable ever!!"

Stayed a few nights","Mike was a great host and allowed us to drop off perishables before check-in so we could get out on Cayuga early to fish. Driveway was huge which could easily fit 2 trucks with boat trailers. Great boat house just 10 minutes from Cayuga State Park boat launch and 12 minutes to Mud Lock DEC launch. Having a backyard deck was great. I brought my small Kamado Joe for smoke grilling. Kitchen had all the pots, pans, and utensils needed to cook meals. Having a dishwasher and washer and dryer was also great when you come back at the end of the day sweaty and smelling of bass. Comfy spot for a weekend getaway or in our case 6 days of fishing with the Hobie BOS kayak bass fishing tournament to end the trip. Highly recommend and plan to book again next year."

It’s close by to restaurants, gyms, and walking paths. The beds are comfortable and the couch blankets are close to heavenly, especially when you come in from the winter cold. On many nights, we curled up in the blankets and watched Netflix (which was included on the TV) before cooking dinner. I’d recommend this AirBnB to anyone looking for either a short or long term stay in Seneca Falls, and I could see it working for friend nights, romantic getaways, visiting family, or anything else of that nature. The host, Mike, is very responsive and understanding. Overall, we had a great time, and I would recommend."

I loved the location and view of the lake. The sun does come blasting in to the common spaces after sunrise so it does make the TV difficult to watch because of the glare. We used the umbrella from the table outside to provide us with some shade in the dining area. Window treatments would be nice for both privacy and relief from the direct sunlight. Despite this, it really is a lovely place. It was comfortable for our family of eight."

We had enough room to “move in” for 2 nights and comfortably fit our clothes, toiletries, food etc.
There were enough amenities throughout the home, and we had everything we needed. The rooms had comfortable linens and blankets, and the kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, garbage bags, Keurig etc.
Both levels of decks had enough chairs and tables for my group, and there was plenty of room for everyone to sit comfortably inside.
There wasn’t anything I wished they had that they didn’t.
My whole family enjoyed our stay, and didn’t want to leave! Between the beautiful modern interior, and the amazing lake views, we all had an unforgettable stay and would recommend this house to everyone!"

There was 5 adults staying at the home which provided enough space for everyone. Although several of the bedrooms had window treatments, we would recommend some more be place throughout the home for privacy. It would also be helpful in the living room and dining room to help with the bright sunlight that came through the windows in the morning. As Floridians we are use to the sun but it was very bright and we found ourselves turning away from the windows as the sun came up. The TV was also very difficult to see due to the glare from the sun. The porch was perfect to sit on and we enjoyed the kayaks and fishing poles. It was a very fun week in which the time went to fast. We hope to come back one day. Thank you Hank for letting us enjoy your home."

New dock was good and kayaks/tubes readily available. Only downside of note is that interior noise carries throughout the house even with doors closed and at all levels of house., especially at night. Needs more shades on some of the windows downstairs and kitchen area. Upstairs shower curtain way too small. Steep stairs down from parking area. Plenty of parking for 4 cars. Overall, a great place for a family vacation. Thanks, Hank."

The location was close to shops, grocery stores and lots of amazing wineries. I highly recommend trying the Spotted Duck ice cream place and I think my favorite winery was Three Brothers because of the variety of options there. I definitely recommend trying the beer at their brewery. The view from the deck at the home was stunning. If you are considering this place, you should also know that the driveway is steep and no real good way to get your luggage to the house so be prepared. Hank is excellent at communication and will be helpful if any issues arise. I highly recommend this home if your heading to Seneca Falls."

Group trip","This house is truly gorgeous! The location allows for spectacular views of the Cayuga Lake. There were six of us who came up to the Finger Lakes to enjoy a weekend away and we had a thoroughly good time in this beautiful house. The communication was easy and clear and we had no issues when checking in or logging into the Wi-Fi. There were plenty of towels, sheets, and dishes for us to use during our stay. We drove two mini vans up and were able to easily park our two vehicles, but I wouldn’t recommend more than two vehicles at the house.
Our only slight issues were the physical access to the house and a lack of blinds/curtains in the bedrooms on the lower level. There are no stairs leading down from the parking pad and there isn’t a walking path across the yard to get to the house. In ideal weather conditions, this isn’t likely a problem. However, we had rain on two days of our stay, so the front yard was quite slick and a bit muddy. Hopefully, the host adds stairs and a walkway."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay at this little lake house. The views are amazing - there’s nothing quite like waking up to see the lake right in front of you! We even had a blue heron visitor on the dock while we were there.
The space is small, but it was exactly what we needed, and we loved just sitting on the couch and staring out at the water.
The hosts are super responsive, communicative, and kind. You can tell they put a lot of thought and love into the home - for a small space, it has so many thoughtful storage spots and little things to make guests comfortable.
A few things to keep in mind if you visit:
- The spiral staircase is TIGHT. It’s manageable, but just FYI!
- The house is surrounded by trees and bushes from the neighbor’s side that creep into the staircase.
- There are some cute spaces to hang out outside - be wary that it is very “nature-y” (aka lots of critters and bugs)
All in all, we had a really pleasant stay! Definitely a good home base for a Finger Lakes trip"

It is listed at a similar price point to other homes in the area that are 2-3 times the size. However, for a couple, the house is the perfect size. I would absolutely recommend this home to friends looking to vacation to Cayuga Lake!!"

The tiny home is absolutely stunning. Modern and updated, stunning views, and very private. Although there are neighbors around, it’s very quiet and feels secluded. I was nervous about the spiral staircase inside, but it is easy to get up and down the steps. Came stocked with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, which was really nice to see! They also supplied all the pots, pans, and dishes you could ever need! The lock pad to get inside is very easy to use, and makes me feel good to not have to carry a key around with me.

The location was great, we visited wineries, breweries, Muranda cheese for a cheese tasting and even the casino! Already looking forward to our next stay at The Cape!

Stay was extremely comfortable and felt like home. Renee had gone above and beyond for preparing fresh and tasty breakfast for all the guests. Fresh cheese bagel was a hit. Thank you Renee for your amazing hospitality.

Riding through the farmland, and rolling hills near Seneca Falls was a big treat! The countryside added some nice variety to my canal bike riding time between Rochester and Syracuse."

I was coming to town for a concert at Del Lago Casino Resort in Waterloo, NY and Renee's place was only a short 10 minute drive away which made it the perfect location and way more cost effective than staying at the resort hotel on a weekend night.
The room was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. Renée was very accommodating with an early check-in request and the complimentary continental breakfast was absolutely delicious and included freshly homemade bagels.
I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if find myself in the area. Great find!"

Joseph’s place is located on the second floor of his law office, and it is pretty close to all the wineries and hiking trails we wanted to visit.
The condo is much more spacious than it looks on the pictures, and incredibly clean and well maintained.
From the check in to check out, everything was seamless, and I really think Joseph is an attentive host.
The place had everything we needed including Keurig coffee and trail mix.^^
Our family had a great stay during our 4 day visit, and we strongly recommend this place to anyone!

I stayed with my husband and 2 pups and we all immediately felt right at home. The yard was absolutely perfect for getting the pups some outdoor playtime and it’s a beautiful view (caught several beautiful sunsets!).
Everything inside was super comfortable, spacious and had everything we could possibly need. The house is very close to Del Lago Casino which was great for the night we went to a show there, and a short drive to grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants.

Four of us, cycling from Buffalo to Albany, stayed at Tiffany's, and very much appreciated the washer/dryer, the offer to use the barn space to store our bikes, and the fire pit. Most amazing was Tiffany and Mike's graciousness at driving us to town to get some dinner (Uber and Lyft seemingly non-existent) since we didn't want to be biking back to their home in the dark. A terrific stay, and a beautiful spot in the midst of rolling farm fields. The acres and acres of sunflowers just up the road were particularly magical."

I had the most relaxing stay and it felt just like home. Thankyou to you both for making sure I got here safely and for taking me around the supermarket and town on the Saturday I had so much fun.
Can’t thank you both enough for ensuring I was safe at all times and I really loved meeting you as I was concerned about driving again on the other side of the road 😂 I know you don’t usually meet your guests unless they need something so I’m truly grateful for your kindness when I needed it.

Stayed with a pet","All of the great reviews for this unit are spot on accurate! The house is situated on a clean, gorgeous, secluded plot of farm land where the wild turkeys run free off in the distance.
Our two dogs Goose and Baloo had the time of their lives running around as my SO ran the Seneca 7 all day.
Tiffany is also a great communicator! She responded to our questions and requests for accommodations on the spot which made us feel at home.
Additionally her house manual (right of the kitchen sink/counter) made for an easy time touring the area, while greatly assisting with finding/using all of the beautiful appliances found around the house.
If you like a quiet, cozy county house on a beautiful plot of land than this is the place for you!!
10/10 would stay again"

Stayed with a pet","I am thrilled to write a review for my Airbnb stay, which was an absolutely awesome experience! From start to finish, my stay was delightful, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
The host was incredibly welcoming and hospitable, making me feel right at home from the moment I arrived. They went above and beyond to ensure that I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The house was immaculate and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities one could ask for. It was clear that the host had put a lot of thought and care into making the space feel warm and inviting.
The location of the house was also excellent, situated in a lovely suburb with plenty of shops and restaurants within 3-5 miles. The host provided great recommendations for local attractions and restaurants, which made exploring the area even more enjoyable.
Overall, my stay at this Airbnb was absolutely fantastic. I had a wonderful time and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, welcomin"

There were cute cupcakes made for us (that we didn’t even get a chance to eat because we had too many snacks 🤭) as well as a thank you card! Everything was clean & we loved how it was updated & decorated. We had an awesome time!

Beds were very nice and comfortable. Home was well decorated, enjoyed fireplace and the open floor plan. Views of farm fields were tremendous. Hope to get back soon. Thank you,,"

Stayed with a pet","Really nice gem outside of Seneca Falls. I was blown away by how quiet it was - especially given how convenient and close it is to the thruway. Even outside at night you can’t hear anything from the backyard.
We stayed with family to have a bigger kitchen to make a Thanksgiving dinner with our small group. The house is clean and the open kitchen and living room was as I would describe “a cooking show TV set” - great big, open space and nice communal living area for your group.
We were there in the winter so we didn’t get to sit out and enjoy the stars too much but the sunrises over the fence and barn each morning were really nice. We brought out city pup and had him running all over the yard enjoying the quiet country road - not worried about him running off."

The rural surroundings were so quiet, which we truly appreciated since we live in a busy suburban neighborhood with lots of traffic, neighbors, and families (kids). Saw more wildlife than we did people (not complaining, We loved this!) We had a brief concern that we might not like being away from a town center, but really found it a fresh breath of air! A lovely welcoming change!! A quiet evening glass of wine and early morning peaceful cup of coffee. Perfect. We would stay again and would highly recommend!"

It truly felt like we were staying in the guest house of a friend because of everything she did to make it welcoming. The water pressure is great in the showers, the bedrooms are all equally nice, and we loved the living spaces and outdoor patio with fire pit. We had a lovely girls weekend to visit the MacKenzie-Childs Artisan Fest and traveled to nearby wineries and local spots in Auburn, Aurora, Seneca Falls, Waterloo, and Union Springs. The location was just about a half hour from our furthest points. If we return to the area we'll definitely be looking to book with Tiffany again."

Also very convenient to Seneca Falls, Geneva etc...grabbing a bite to eat was great too. Communication, the best. Tiffany was very helpful from the first interaction to the very end.

Stayed a few nights","A little slice of heaven!! This beautiful house and landscape is simply breathtaking. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights with our small dog and we were honored to be Tiffany’s first guests. We were greeted with such a lovely and delicious plate of homemade cookies and fresh flowers and Tiffany also had dog biscuits and baggies, such a thoughtful touch. The decor was lovely with homey touches, beautiful kitchen with beautiful island and appliances including an ice maker which we appreciated. All rooms were good sized and the master bedroom and bathroom were beautiful with a big corner shower and walk in closet big enough to be another bedroom. While the home was gorgeous and comfy our time was mostly spent outdoors. The view is incredible, farmland, trees, beautiful birds and daily visits from the deer made our vacation truly exquisite. This is the perfect spot for someone craving privacy and peace. Couches in the living room were all recliners, which was very nice, and super comfy. The master bed was a firmer bed but grateful to find a king bed , outdoor furniture was very nice and comfortable. We used the gas grill and there was a fire pit as well. We enjoyed cooking our meals with groceries from our visit to Sauder’s Store, a wonderful Amish grocery store a few miles away and stayed in and enjoyed this wonderful home! We had an issue with the tv which Tiffany responded to immediately. Beautifully decorated, lots of homey touches, peace and quiet with nature all around truly restored our soles for a much needed reset. Can’t wait for our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay in Seneca Falls at Renee's place. Renee is a great host, great communication, warm and welcoming. We stayed in the blue room with a private bathroom in the hallway. It was charming and comfortable, and we particularly enjoyed relaxing in the little coffee room across the hall, where drinks and snacks are available all day. There are equally charming common spaces on the first floor for guest use. Breakfast was delicious... and it's true, Renee's homemade bagels and fixings are such a treat! We were also delighted with delicious waffles and fruit the second morning.
This home is easy walking distance to the town, with restaurants, the Women's Rights National Park and museum (being the birthplace of the suffrage movement) and the charm of being considered the inspiration for much of the movie It's a Wonderful Life. It's also about a 10 minute drive to the Montezuma Natl Wildlife Refuge. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend a stay at this Airbnb!"

Renee is a friendly and open host who gave us helpful tips for the area. The house is a former monastery and has lovingly restored rooms. The two cats also create a feel-good atmosphere.

Stayed a few nights","Renee is the consummate AirBnB host. Her homemade baked goods are the highlight of a superb continental breakfast, which include many high quality options. Her attention to detail is second to none! There are dozens of amenities which show forethought and great consideration of guest requirements. The bed and bedding was MOLTO comodo- VERY comfortable! The 1925 building does not allow for en-suite baths, and you'll have to negotiate a wide staircase (with a solid bannister!) but these are minor compared to the level of service and comfort provided by Renee at a quiet but great location. I'll definitely stay here on all future visits to the area. And there is a huge off-street parking lot as well!"

We stayed two nights in a lovely bedroom adjoining a hallway bathroom with all amenities provided in this clean spacious home. Renee prepared a homemade breakfast each morning that was comparable to any elegant inn. Her hospitality and kind manner was evident in all aspects of our visit. We took a leisurely walk to town, visited the ""It's a Wonderful Life Museum,"" and enjoyed two good restaurant meals during our weekend. Finally, we visited the Seneca Lake State Park Visitor's Center and Esplanade...all of which were recommendations provided by Renee. Just cannot say enough about this fabulous Airbnb experience, and we hope to return again next fall, if not sooner!"

Stayed a few nights","Renee’s place is fantastic. It is decorated beautifully. It could very well be listed as an Historic Inn. It has a handful of available guest rooms and a number of comfortable and classic communal sitting rooms as well. Unlike other AirBnBs which are basically someone’s apartment (and of course - some are very nice), it’s is a TRUE Bed and Breakfast establishment. Renee is a wonder host and she prepares some outstanding breakfasts. A great way to start off the day.
The location is also just a short walk from the main Saranac Falls business district as well as so accessible to the Finger Lakes.
Overall an outstanding and very memorable experience. We highly recommend."

My expectations were met, and then some. From the moment we arrived, until the day we left, everything about her place was absolutely outstanding, including the breakfast! Everything was impeccably clean and she definitely made us feel at home with a warm and welcoming atmosphere as soon as we walked through the front door. The location was perfect as we were able to see and do all of the things that were on our list. I would recommend Renee’s place to anyone! Our visit was nothing short of exceptional from the hospitality to the accommodations with breakfast, and everything in between, our experience was top-notch! If you’re looking for a great place to go to make some good memories, this bed and breakfast is a wonderful choice!"

Great coffee, home made bagels, fresh fruit etc. it was neat to learn some of the history of the home. The location is walkable to Sacketts, a highly rated restaurant, as well as downtown. Lovely home and comfortable room and bed. Very nice sitting room she provides access to, which was perfect for my course work and could serve as office space if work calls.

Stayed one night","Renee’s place is perfect for a getaway to the Finger Lakes.
We visited for hiking, breweries/wineries, and a concert at Del Lago, and found it centrally located for all.
Her hospitality is impeccable, the rooms thoughtfully appointed, and sparkling clean. Breakfast was a great bonus!
We loved meeting her kitties as well, and look forward to staying again on our next trip!"

Stayed one night","My experience, in a word, was ""PERFECT."" The unique history of this house is part of the charm that attracted me to Renee's lovely home. She was a stellar hostess who met me at the door and welcomed me into her home. After indicating an interest in the history of the building, she gave me a tour and shared some future restoration plans with me. I was delighted!! Breakfast was simple and delicious.... just perfect for my trek to the historic sites in Seneca Falls. One of my personal benchmarks that determines a return visit is cleanliness, and again, Renee more than met the criterion. I did not get to all of the places I wanted to visit in Seneca Falls, so I look forward to a return visit, and I will assuredly be booking with Renee again!"

Stayed a few nights","Seneca Falls is not to be missed... charming, historic, fun, and beautiful.
Finding Renee’s beautiful home just a few minutes walk to the historic spots in downtown Seneca Falls was a wonderful treat.
I walked to and from town across the historic bridge and immersed myself in amazing visits to Women’s Rights Park and museums. And the Women’s Hall of Fame was a delight to soak in. Beautiful spots to sit and rest by the canal and also on the lake. Enjoyed the Sculpture trail along the canal as well.
I will be back to visit and definitely stay at Renee’s.
I stayed in the Blue Room with a private bath outside my door. Everything was clean and fresh. The shower was great and the bathtub would be great for a nice soak. So very, very clean.
Renee provides shampoo and soaps, hair dryers, lovely towels. In addition to the room, there is access to a sitting room with coffee and tea whenever you want and a quiet sitting room on the first floor for reading or chatting.
Very quiet house, great sleeping, and wonderful to return home to after day of sightseeing.
Great breakfast of oatmeal with yummy things to add to it including warm maple syrup. Yogurt, juice, coffee, water and fruit.
I highly recommend the restaurant on Fall Street 84Fall is the name...I had warm goat cheese, beets and salad greens. One of their Little Plates. Scrumptious
Also Thai Mussel Pot...a lot of mussels cooked with a Thai curry sauce.
Both Exquisite with a glass of champagne with blackberry added.
Finished with trio of desserts including lemon curd with blueberries.visit Seneca Falls and include Renee’s place for your home."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay, Jannick is very responsive and kind. However, the place was not in line with our expectations in a few areas. If you are searching for something luxurious you should try a different listing. The driveway is not paved. When we arrived it was raining so we were trampling through 60 feet of mud as we were taking our belongings inside. If we hadn't moved our car further up the driveway we may have been stuck trying to leave the next morning. When we opened the front door we were hit with a foul smell that we could not find the source of and never went away (though we did get used to it and were able to get comfortable with candles and febreze). The house is smaller than the photos suggest (only about 500 sq. ft and the kitchen is very tight) and the floor across the entire home is tilted towards the lake. On the bright side, the view is spectacular and the house was really cozy. Great place for a couple looking to relax and read while looking at the lake."

Peaceful place to sit either in the living room looking out to the lake or on the patio with the fire place. The night sky is also beautiful as we have never seen so many stars and shooting stars! Jannick is a wonderful host and she will take care of any issues you have! Thank you, Jannick, for providing a wonderful place for us to spend our anniversary. Surrounding wineries are not too far and the town of Seneca falls has some good places to eat. We would definitely return to this peaceful lake house!"

I woke up the first morning to the beautiful view of the lake, which I could see while still in bed, and a great blue heron landed on the neighbor’s deck. It would be the first of many. We also saw a fox and loved the soundtrack of waves and water. We took the kayaks out, which couldn’t have been easier, and the space had everything we needed. The shower has excellent pressure and plenty of hot water. We highly recommend State Baker & BBQ, a five-minute drive away, on weekends for breakfast sandwiches (brisket biscuit), amazing croissants and pastries, coffee, and more. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect get-away cottage for the two of us. The cottage is right on the lake with gorgeous views from all windows. We visited in the summer and took advantage of the kayaks that Jannick made available to us. We only used the stove once to cook a quick skillet meal. The kitchen is small but surprisingly functional and equipped,although cooking a bigger meal would have been super challenging due to the very limited counter space. We loved sitting in the comfy chairs looking out the bay window to the lake, as well as sitting out on the spacious deck watching the birds and the boats go by. Although there are neighbors on either side it is very private. Everything was as described. We did have to get used to the unusual placement of the light switches at first, and we also had to take quick showers because the hot water ran out if we didn't. Taking one shower in the AM and the other in the PM worked great. The location was perfect for our liking. I totally geeked out at the It's a Wonderful Life Museum! We visited the Montezuma wetlands, biked the Seneca-Cayuga trail, walked part of the sculpture trail, and of course, visited several wineries!! Our favorite was Three Brothers but Swedish Hill was nice too. We also really liked Wolfies for a casual dinner with a lakeside view. All in all, I would recommend this cottage...great host, nice place, and good location!!"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy cottage on the lake. Fire place and fire pit on the deck were very nice. View was beautiful. Close to attractions too. However, this was more of a camping experience. There was no sink in the bathroom. The washer/dryer combo in the bedroom omitted a mildew smell that we counter acted with air deodorizes we purchased. We bought our own bedding and towels for hygiene purposes. The bed was unfortunately not comfortable as well. The Livingroom chairs however were delightfully very comfortable. We did not try the futon couch, so we cannot speak to that. We did however experience ants near and around the bay window and had to clean the outside of the window as we could not see out due to seaweed and dirt covering the window. As it is on a lake I suppose this is inevitable, but we had hoped that with back to back bookings for this cottage that it would be cleaned. All in all we had a good experience. The weather was nice and we spent most of our time on the wonderful deck."

I would recommend this stay for anybody looking to slow down and collect their thoughts!

I'd imagine this would be extra lovely in the summer with direct access to the lake from the deck, but it was also beautiful in the snow. Jannick was very communicative throughout the days leading up to my trip and sent me messages while I was there to make sure I was okay - which was much appreciated since I was traveling along.
The location is great since it's right on the water and only a few minutes away from Seneca Falls and around 20 minutes away from Geneva. Definitely recommend for a peaceful getaway!"

Stayed about a week","Wow.. i was so glad i got this beautiful place at very last moment.. I'll save the long writing and just get to the pros and cons..
PROS:
Jannick (the host) is very helpful, responds in time, lives just 2 properties away. You get complete water view from bedroom window. A huge window in living area and amazing water view. A study desk which was very helpful for me since I had office work to attend to in day time. Very good wifi, no issues with speed and continuity of service there. There are 2 kayaks.. me and my wife enjoyed kayaking, you do see folks boating or jet skiing or kayaking.. not crowdy but good to see a face or two while in the water. A huge deck with firepit.. enjoyed the evenings just sitting there and watching the waters.. you have a neighbor which also I think is on AirBnb.. no noise though. you can hear them but you can't see.. you can just get into water from your deck.. there's ladder there.
CONS:
No wash basin the bathroom but it was not a con for me and my wife to be honest.. it's a silly small thing which i don't count.. that's it.. we enjoyed our stay so hardly see any cons
Thank you so much Jannick.. you were very helpful at the times I called you for help.. We would love to be back sometime again.. Take care!"

Jannick thought of pretty much everything so all we had to do was get food when we arrived. She also was quick to respond with any questions we had. The water is easy to access for swimming and kayaking. Deck feels pretty private as you can’t see the people to the left due to trees and the house on the right is a bit further back. We also had some great meals in the area and there are several wineries close by. Nice, relaxing place for two. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy little cottage on the water. We stayed for a long weekend. Swimming right off the deck. Overall a nice stay, but a few things we noted: bugs at night made the deck pretty much only usable without any light/fire (they were attracted to the light)- we’ve stayed at various places in the Finger Lakes and never experienced that so not sure if it was due to the time of year, location, or what. It was disappointing to not be able to really enjoy the firepit. When we arrived we checked the propane tanks and they were both empty, but the host brought a refill minutes after we notified her. The charcoal grill needed to be cleaned out, but everything needed to grill was provided which was nice. Overall, the pictures are accurate and it was a decent value."

Also the deck was very livable and had a big table, cushioned chairs and a gas fire pit. We loved the kayaks for use as well. There is no sink in the bathroom but this is a cottage. We were glad for the central air conditioning which is not always the case in a cottage. My daughter and I were the guests and the size was perfect. There are thick hedges for privacy from the nearest neighbors. I would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I can’t recommend this cottage enough! I went with my boyfriend for a short winter getaway and we enjoyed ourselves so much.
We stayed in late December- we got to watch the lake freeze over and even got a few inches of snow! Despite the cold temperatures, the cottage stayed very comfortable and warm with the help of the amazing cast iron stove and the central heater. The pictures are beautiful but don’t do it justice, you have to go see this place yourself!
Jannick was so sweet and checked in on us during our stay to make sure everything was okay and that we were having a good time.
If you’re looking for a nice, quiet, winter getaway look no further. (And I’m sure it’s just as lovely in the summer!)"

Stayed about a week","We had a great time relaxing,fishing and enjoying the beautiful scenery. Our grandson visited for 2 days and he’ll have a memory for life of fishing right off the deck and catching his first Northern Pike! He didn’t catch it the traditional way but his fishing line wrapped around his gills. We were able to release him unharmed, yet he got the thrill of the big fight and catch. A wonderful memory maybe one day he can share with his little boy or girl.
The cottage is perfect for two but we had plenty of room for 3 adults and a child. We found no inconvenience in using the kitchen sink.(bathroom doesn’t have one) Hot Water not a problem at all for us either. Kitchen totally sufficient for preparing meals. Jannick was so cordial and even invited us out on her boat. We couldn’t go but a note that there’s a golf course 10 minutes or less up the road.(my plans for that particular day)
To sum it up, if your really looking for some down time, this is the place. You can leave all your worries at the road and just relax.
Another thing worth mentioning is AIRNB. We had no problems booking or contacting our host through the app. We had to cut our trip short by a few days and cancelling was no problem and we were refunded the next day.
Thanks again Jannick, for the use of your cottage “on the lake” and the unforgettable
memories.

Stayed a few nights","The first thing you'll notice about this home is that you missed it when driving past. All but impossible to see from the road, you're looking for an almost invisible driveway hidden behind a hedgerow. Once you find it, you find a cute little cabin that is really out on the water. A code lets you in (way better than a key!) to a cozy cabin, with wood floors and enormous windows looking out over the lake.
You get access to a lovely patio out back, with a wind-out awning, a number of chairs, and a picnic table all to yourself. There are kayak's to take out on the water (though the paddles seem to be a little worse for wear), or you can just climb off the dock and swim around in the water.
The location is right on the Cayuga wine trail, though getting a Lyft is not exactly an option. I'd recommend buying your wine on the road, bringing it back to the house, and enjoying it overlooking the lake or around the gas fireplace/stove in the living room. In a similar vein, all the major food delivery services aren't set up around here as of yet, so ordering in food has to be done old-school: over the phone!
Montezuma wildlife trail is super close, and is a great day trip (they have many bald eagles!), or you can hop over to Seneca Falls, a lovely little town close by. The actual neighborhood where this house is located is not really walkable, but driving wasn't an issue.
One thing we didn't realize before booking is that there is only one sink in the house, in the kitchen. The bathroom consists *only* of a shower and toilet. There's also a hairdryer, but no outlet in the bathroom either, so a morning might consist of the wife blow-drying her hair in the living room while you brush your teeth in the kitchen. For two adults this place is perfect; for more than that, or if you have kids, this might be a tighter squeeze.
Another small issue was that the house gets buggy. There's not much to do about this, but you will be sharing the space (inside and out) with some spiders, moths, mosquitos, and carpenter ants. The house is not air-tight, you're in a very biologically dense area (on the lakeshore), you're going to see a few bugs.
Overall, we had an amazing time at the cabin. It was romantic, cozy, fun, and relaxing. We whole-heartedly recommend this to any couple looking to have a week/weekend out in the finger lakes."

Stayed a few nights","Went here on a trip from NYC to escape the noise, however, be aware the neighbors are very close and one neighbor is also renting their space on airbnb. While we were there the neighbor rented the space to 6-8 young college men who blasted their music throughout the night. We asked them to lower their music and they would for about 5 min. We contacted our host, who in all fairness did her best and contacted her neighbor to let them know about the noise. While I am sure this won't happen to others it did happen to us and stating this so renters know there are neighbors very close. The inside of the rental was SPOTLESS. We did not mind using the sink in the kitchen for brushing teeth etc. I do not think the hot water lasts a full hour. For two people taking 10 min showers water started getting cold toward the end of the second shower. The Patio area was not very clean. There were spider webs EVERYWHERE. I counted 10-12 huge webs. If someone were to have cleaned the night before or even two to three days before there is no way there would have been so many webs. I cleaned them so that I could enjoy the patio. The hanging chairs on the patio were not in great condition. Overall we enjoyed our stay visiting many wineries and the lakes."

Stayed with kids","The next best thing to having your own cottage on the lake. The views across Cayuga from the windows and large deck are stunning. Inside has an updated ""cabin-like"" feel, with a big gas stove to keep things warm and comfortable.
Kitchen and bathroom are small but functional, and things that seemed like they might be inconvenient really weren't: the one sink is just feet away from the bathroom, and the limited hot water is fairly easy to pace out.
Self-check in couldn't have been easier, and Janik was thoughtful enough to leave charcoal and igniter for grilling on the deck (don't miss Sauder's Amish Market down the road). She also sent helpful instructions for use of the canoes -- we didn't take them out as the lake had grown windy and choppy the day we planned on, but it would have been easy to do (next time!).
We were happy just to explore the lakes then relax out on the deck -- few things more beautiful than a full moon on the water. This place has a great host and all but guarantees a wonderfully private, peaceful stay."

Directly on Lake Cayuga (and I mean ON the lake), the cabin provided lots of opportunities to engage with nature: watching Canadian geese float by as they took a rest from their migration south while drinking our morning coffee on the deck, kayaking around the northern end of the lake before an afternoon of wine tasting, etc. It’s location at the northern end of Cayuga also provided the perfect home base from which to explore Skineatles, Seneca, Ithaca, and everything in between. We would be happy to stay here again the next time we find ourselves in western NY."

The area was surprisingly quiet; more people fishing or kayaking than driving motorboats. The one drawback is that the stairs leading into the water looked a bit awkward to get on. Jannick was very agreeable and accommodating. When we asked how to get network programs on the smart TV, she kindly had a UHF antenna installed the next day, so we were able to watch the World Cup as well as 17 other over-the-air channels. We would definitely recommend the cottage for a couple and also highly recommend Sauders Mennonite market, about 4 miles away and so much nicer than regular supermarkets."

There were filters for the coffee machine but no coffee so don't get caught out. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & I would be more than happy to recommend this property."

Stayed a few nights","The place is lovely, with a water view and a patio outside. It was really nice to just drink tea and sit on the chair watching the water. The cabin is a bit small, we had 3 people and it was perfect, but probably will be a bit crowded if you have more people. The patio however was quite big, and you can go into the lake from there. The hot water is limited every hour or something - the details were in the guide book but we probably didn't plan well so hot water ran out during my shower. Jannick was very responsive, and kindly let us check out a bit later to give us more time."

Due to the unfortunate bad weather when we happened to be there, we needed to spend a bunch of time in the house, but with the window overlooking the lake, that did not feel so bad. Since the house sits right on the edge of the water, it feels like being on a houseboat. Hopefully, we will get a chance to return."

Stayed a few nights","The location of this cottage is really unbeatable. Right on the lake, yet also close to anything you might need. Although, we loved the privacy. We spent hours in front of the bay window literally just staring at the gorgeous, iced-over lake while sipping coffee or wine.
The space itself is a bit rustic (could be notable to some that there’s no sink in the bathroom, and the bed linens could use a slight update), but we really made ourselves right at home. We brought groceries for several days and were able to cook up a storm in the well-equipped kitchen. The gas fireplace heats up the place in no time at all - it’s so cozy, even when it’s 5 degrees outside - and the smart tv was awesome! We had our own Spotify music on (or Netflix show) almost all the time.
We sincerely enjoyed our stay so much that we decided to stay another day! Jannick was immediately responsive and accommodating to our change of plans, even though it was New Years and she was in another country! We highly recommend staying here during ANY season."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at this adorable lakeside cottage! The view is gorgeous and the gas wood burning stove kept the place cozy and warm. There is also a lot to do in the area. We had a fantastic meal at 84 Fall in downtown Seneca Falls and took an interesting trip to the nearby Women's Rights Museum. We also picked up a tasty bottle of red wine at Montezuma Winery right up the street. During the week, we ventured down to Taughannock Falls State Park and hiked to the base of the frozen waterfall and it was stunning. We then spent some time strolling around the shops in Ithaca, had a lovely dinner, and brought some tasty treats back from Ithaca Bakery. Jannick was very responsive whenever we reached out with a question. We hope to return again."

Nice not having to pack shampoo, etc. Full kitchen for use, although we took advantage of the variety of restaurants in walking distance. The view is serene on the canal with Wonderful life bridge. I thoroughly enjoyed the morning walks with the sculpture trail and canal walk. Seneca Falls is a quiet town with lots of history. The surrounding area is filled with wineries, galleries, waterfalls, and many trail walks. Worth a visit and stay at Veronica’s. My husband & I both had a nice anniversary vacation. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","What Veronica has done with the space is absolutely amazing! You can tell how much heart and care she invests in her space. It was the most adorable space I have stayed at. Even though it was an apartment feel, it was so quiet and so cozy! My mother is a very harsh critic, especially when it comes to cleanliness, and she was SO impressed.
Every single detail was thought of, down to the toilet paper being folded to a triangle design. The snack bowl was such a perfect touch and came in handy for our drives to different surrounding areas and on the way back home.
The location was perfect! We were able to walk to everything -- restaurants, historic spots and the shopping was right outside of our door. Really cute coffee shop right across the street as well!
I would highly recommend Veronica's space and hope to stay there again when I return."

The kitchen is fully stocked - wine glasses, pots, bowls, utensils, everything. And everything is beautifully decorated! My family couldn’t stop raving about the apartment days after we left. Coupling these factors with the great price we paid, booking Veronica’s Airbnb is a no-brainer."

Stayed a few nights","I planned a surprise trip for my wife and mother-in-law, and Veronica was onboard from the very beginning! She even asked what kind of wine they enjoyed so that a bottle was waiting for them when they arrived! My wife couldn’t stop raving about how great the place was - full of wonderful books, stocked Keurig/tea bar, snacks available, beautiful location, and so much more. My wife and her mom walked everywhere around town from Veronica’s place. When they went to a farmer’s market, they even had a fully stocked kitchen to cook dinner in. They especially loved having separate ares for themselves, and kept talking about when their next trip would be. During their stay, a water line came loose from the bathtub. Veronica and her husband Jeff were on top of it as soon as they were informed! They fixed the issue, provided fresh towels and a clean bathmat, and they made sure to keep my wife informed of their progress the whole way. Thank you Veronica for making their trip a success!"

Location is a short distance to the bars and restaurants and right on the water which I forgot about. All linens, towels and washcloths provided and plenty for 4 women.
Only downfall is the mattresses on the bunks are not comfortable at all and two of us were very sore the next dayMaybe bring a mattress topper if you plan to use them.
If you're looking for a clean, private, quiet place to stay definitely don't look past this booking! Thank you to the host for sharing their great space."

Check in was super easy!!! We received a message with all the check in information in such a prompt manner. Once we were checked in we checked out the house. So many cute wonderful little touches!!! the Duck 😂 we loved it. there were drinks and snacks provided that my boys dug right into 😂. The rooms were so clean and great.

Stayed with kids","Jaimie & Todd are fantastic hosts. Communication before booking and during our stay was fast and accommodating.
They very accurately described the property - it’s an old home. The kind built well before central AC! Knowing this ahead of time, we knew what we were getting - creaky stairs & all. Reminded us of our grandparents old homes, but with some updates and extra comforts.
The in-window ac units kept the place cool enough on the hot humid July days. The one bathroom was roomy and had enough vanity space for our family of four to keep our toiletries. And, the shower never ran out of hot water! The kitchen/dining area was spacious and had everything we needed. The living area was super comfy. The perfect spot to relax for a bit after a long day exploring the Finger Lakes. The bedrooms worked just fine for sleeping. The room with the king bed was great. The other two rooms worked for our kids, but might be a bit small for other adults?! Our family was up early most days, but we did note the sun shines bright into the rooms in July. Just something to note if you’re light sensitive. Best of all, the home was very clean! Always top on our checklist.
The location fit our needs perfectly. Seneca Falls is a quiet, charming town with a great women’s rights vibe - being the “birthplace” of the suffrage movement. From the statues and parks, to our favorite breakfast place, Cafe 19 (as in amendment), you really feel the heart of the town. We loved the pizza at Little Italy and the ice cream at Love’s (right around the corner from the bnb). Anything you want to see in the Finger Lakes is reasonably 10 minutes to 2hrs away. And, there’s always a winery or brewery to make a pit stop at for those longer drives.
The value that Jaimie & Todd are offering can not be beat. We are so glad we booked with them for a longer stay versus other places that were double the cost. Along with a clean, comfy place, they allowed us to have the most important thing of all: more time to spend as a family enjoying the Finger Lakes!"

Due to the hot weather, we appreciated the air-con having been turned on before our arrival. Entry via door code was easy. Snacks, water & coffee pods were a thoughtful addition. Great location to walk to Seneca Falls main street with breweries & restaurants. We were there for the Canal Fest July 1-3 so enjoyed the carnival and especially the fireworks."

Would not have stayed if had not prepaid. Bathroom clean. Due to smell would not have considered using the kitchen st all. Overall appeared clean. Spent little time there. Beds not comfortable. Soft foam on top of mattress in larger bedroom was terrible. Entry to property is seamless. Carport is good. Good location for visiting Seneca Falls. Worst experience that I have had with Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","We had a nice stay at Jaimie and Todd's Cozy White House in Seneca Falls. Upon arriving, we found the home to be exceptionally clean and easy to access with their instructions. We appreciated the work that has gone into restoring this home, and there were a few touches that made our stay enjoyable. The towels provided were nice, and the main bed has a foam mattress topper that lent to a restful night's sleep. There is also a fun arcade game upstairs to spend a few minutes enjoying. We'd suggest adding a couple sheer curtains to both the side door, and the kitchen window for added privacy, especially since the bathroom is off of the kitchen on the main floor. Some curtains in the main bedroom might help with light as well, but that's mainly because we're late risers. Overall, we thought the price was fair, and the location (just over 1000ft to the main strip) was walkable for those looking to explore the town. This was a great first experience up in the Finger Lakes!"

I agree with other reviewers -- it's super clean.The house is in the town of Seneca Falls where the Women's National Historical Park is located although it is temporarily closed at this time. The location was central (~40 min- 1 hour) to many places we visited including Watkins Glen, Taughanock Falls, and all the lakes and respective wine trails. It's also an hour from the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester. The house was great to come back to after a long day of hiking and driving. We literally would plop on the couch and just watch movies on their big screen TV."

A big TV, comfy chairs and sofa, and three bedrooms were perfect for us (a family of four). The house has A/C (central air downstairs and window units upstairs) and, even though a bit noisy when ON (especially the window units), it was nice having them. This is recently renovated old house and will probably be improved further by the owners but it already has everything you need (including high quality shampoo and body wash!).

Centrally located between Cayuga and Seneca lakes we were able to take in the best of both lakes and the surrounding areas. We loved that they had a full array of items to cook with as we brought food and cooked meals at home almost every day. The coffee and snacks provided were a nice touch as well. The place was very clean and quiet. We tried a number of the restaurants they recommended and all of them were wonderful and a few were walking distance from the house so we were able to get to them without worrying about parking. All in all we really enjoyed our stay - thank you for the hospitality!
