Stayed a few nights","Extremely need and tidy. Second time staying at this location when I’ve come to town and I will stay again.
The price is better and much cleaner than any hotel downtown. Not to mention, you have space in an appt rather than simply a room with two beds.
Highly recommended and I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs in the area over the last several years. We have family in Cumberland and are very familiar with the stays/options in the area."

Stayed one night","Very easy to find, park, and obtain occupancy of the place. Wes communicated wonderfully with clear directions of the process. The place is very clean and comfortable. There is a little noise from the tavern below that I had read in previous reviews, but to be 100% honest it was more quiet than traffic driving by and was over when we went to sleep. We would definitely stay here again."

We were able to walk to everything! The only time we heard anything from the tavern below was during live music on a Friday night. The place itself was spotless! Very clean and modern. The town itself is undergoing some major street renovations now, so we are hopeful for a trip back in the fall when it’s finished. We definitely plan to stay here again when we return."

The apartment is tastefully decorated with very comfortable furniture and no clutter. The bathroom is well-provisioned and while not needed for this stay, the laundry facilities are a great amenity.
I highly recommend the location and the host(s)."

The location was a bit sketchy and we could hear screaming altercations taking place outside through the night, but that's Cumberland for you. On the flip side, it's within walking distance to many restaurants and the scenic railroad."

I needed flexibility on dates for this stay and Wes couldn't have been more accommodating when I asked to extend. Will continue to be my home away from home in Cumberland."

The Tavern downstairs was delicious and convenient and the full kitchen was perfect for having coffee first thing and cooking meals when we didn’t dine out. Good communication and check-in/check-out was easy. We would definitely stay here again, perhaps on future trips to bike sections of the GAP and C&O trails."

Stayed one night","If you'd like to be in the heart of Cumberland, have access to great food and things to do, look no further! Wes's place is a cool blend of brand new, comfortable and convenient interior features with quaint, old town neighborhood charm.
We highly recommend JJ's (across the street) for pizza & wings. (take out)
Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to enjoy the offerings at the Corner Tavern downstairs, but it looks quaint and has 5 star reviews.
Wes's will be our future ""go to"" when visiting Cumberland."

It is on the second floor up a narrow staircase but there is a secure entry area and bike hooks on ground level. There is a great coffee and sandwich shop (and bar) on the ground floor which was awesome for breakfast. Last but not least, I rolled into town at 4:30pm and messaged about availability. Wes responded within minutes and I was Inter apartment in the few minutes it took to get there. Overall a great experience and I highly recommend a visit."

Stayed a few nights","First impression was not good. We were told that the city enforced the information on the signs. The street was torn up, only 2 hour parking was available. We found out we could park there. Relatively minor situation, but prior notice would have been appreciated.
The first impression was not good. Rundown buildings, trash waiting to be picked up. We got the key from the mailbox with no problem, walked into a wonderful, modern apartment that appeared recently updated. The tavern downstairs was the same, shaky exterior, wonderful interior. The staff and food was outstanding. We stopped there several times.
The next morning all of the trash had been picked up. The city in in the midst of a huge renovation. First impression was absolutely wrong. Walking distance to everyplace we wanted to go. Excellent experince!"

As a heads up: you will hear some music and conversation from the cafe/ tavern into the night, but it didn’t bother us even though we were traveling with a baby! If you are sensitive to noise, a sound machine would easily blot it out."

If you like to cycle there is a bike shop a couple blocks away which I rented a bike and rode to and from Frostburg on the Allegheny trail along the rail line. If you’re lucky you’ll see the old steam engine pass while enjoying the scenery. Overall nice place and will return in the future. Truly a super host!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay in Cumberland was delightful thanks to our host, Wes, and his newly renovated AirB&B apartment. The unit was tastefully furnished and conveniently located over a charming cafe and within easy walking distance of shopping and other restaurants in Cumberland. A comfortable bed, seating areas in the living/dining room and in the full kitchen, laundry machines, and nicely appointed bath/shower. For anyone riding the nearby canal trail, the unit also provided for secure storage for two bicycles. Wes was a very helpful host who made self-check-in and self-check-out easy and secure. This AirB&B was one of the very best in our experience and we’ve stayed at many here in the U.S. and in Europe. We highly recommend it to anyone planning a short or longer stay in Cumberland, Maryland."

Stayed a few nights","This house is a cute 1 floor rambler with a basement. They are going to update the basement so I am wondering what that’s going to look like.
The basement now has a half bath that is ok to use so I hope they hit that on the renovation.
The main house is spacious for the single floor. My wife and myself loved the kitchen, simple but functional.
The bedrooms are off to the left side of the house away from the living room so naps are great here.
The living room is spacious with plenty of seating for 5 or so people and a big TV (Roku).
The outside balcony is nice and has seating for up to 4-5 people and the view of the forest is nice and peaceful. At night you can see all the lightning bugs against the dark tree background. Looks great.
Overall I will be looking to book this house again next time I’m in Cumberland. Everything is 10 minutes or less and no road noise."

The host has thought of every little thing to make a visit comfortable and homey. No stone is left unturned - labeling, safety, household information, and advice on restaurants, shopping, and things to do. Though we didn’t do much cooking, the kitchen has everything, from various types of coffee prep (tea too) to cookware and dishes one would need to prepare a large family meal. There are plenty of TVs, books, and games to keep everyone in the family entertained throughout the cottage. For the two of us, nothing was better than enjoying our coffee in the morning on the Cottage sunlit back porch. It was definitely a home away from home. We would highly recommend it and hope to visit again."

Having just finished a two-day pedal from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Cumberland Cottage was the perfect place to recoup. We all appreciated all of the updates and creature comforts in house; from Alexa, the Smart tv, foosball, and ability to wash and dry our clothes. We just felt at home. Though our AARP cards are brown around the edges, we felt like teenagers, playing games and listening to music provided by Alexa. My wife and I stayed in the Mason & Dixon room. I told her that the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in. We will definitely book Cumberland Cottage the next time we are in Cumberland. Thank you Tammy!"

We really appreciated one small thing - plastic utensils and paper plates on the last day of our stay, so we do not need to use and clean the breakfast dishes again before we leave. In living room big screen TV and good Wi-Fi allowed us to use YouTube and found all the entertainment we need in Russian language. Also when we left we forgot big umbrella and Tammy promised to send it to our address. I would recommend this host and house for anybody who want to explore Western Maryland area."

We had no issues parking right in front her place. Her place is very clean, roomy, clutter free. I loved the bath towels ( weird to highlight it , sure, but they’re so nice) they’re huge and absorbent as well as sturdy and soft. Bathroom shower is nice and roomy and it has excellent water flow. I loved the woodwork in the rental space ,too. I can confirm previous reviews- bed is very comfortable ."

Super clean like previous posts said too:) One thing I did not pick up on in previous posts though, was that there is an apt above this one. I typically avoid apts with upstairs units due to noise and we did hear footsteps and a sliding door, but it wasn’t bad. Also street parking is pretty tight. I’m glad we took our Prius instead of our truck! Cleanliness, bed, shower, and great place to park our bikes made this one of the best Airbnbs I’ve stayed at!"

You won’t want to drag a suitcase with you. A backpack will be better. It is a great place with a great view of downtown Cumberland and tree-covered hills, and I would definitely stay again!"

Welcome to the Bruce House in an upscale historic district in Cumberland, Maryland. It became a favorite the moment I walked through the door. A stately building with a sweeping foyer and an attentive host with a British flair for creating the comforts of home in beautiful and relaxed spaces. With its upholstered seating by a handsome fireplace, the parlor is a great place to convene after hiking or cycling at the nearby GAP trail. The well-equipped kitchenette is a bonus with dishware, utensils, tables and chairs, and a compact fridge, microwave, and sink. Ideal for short or long-term stays. Should you choose The Bruce House for your next lodging experience, I am confident you will be satisfied. It will remain on my radar as one of the best and most affordable experiences in my travels. Thank you, Pam. You ROCK!"

From the moment you step foot into the grand foyer, it's like stepping back in time, but with all of the modern amenities and conveniences.
My room was both opulent and comfy. The 14 foot ceilings made the room feel huge! I appreciated having a private bathroom (with a fabulous shower) and a place to relax, sit/read.
Honestly, you'd never need to leave your room, but having access to the kitchenette and sitting room (with an impressive selection of vinyl records), proved to be a welcome bonus.
Although we didn't meet, Pam was a great communicator. She cheerfully &
promptly answered any/all of my questions with helpful info & hospitable solutions.
Accessing the home was a breeze & the room has its own lock for added security (though, I felt quite secure).
I can hardly wait to return!

The place was walking distance to a great brewery downtown (Dig Deep Brewery) which was a lovely way to finish off a long day of biking. And also a great coffee shop (Basecamp coffee) which opens at 7:00 and is a great way to prep for a new day's bike trip.

I thought well if it was cheaper but no, if it was then it would be hard to believe it would be as good as it is. It is a fair, even good price and I was so happy there.
Thank you so much for providing good accommodations."

We were within walking distance to everything downtown, and even with all of the major street reconstruction underway had no problem getting around. We were only here for one night but enjoyed Cumberland so much that we are thinking of staying a few more nights the next time we are out this way, and will definitely try to book our room here again."

If coming on your bike, note that the house is located at the top of a steep hill. I’m someone who hates having to do anything extra at the end of a long day, and I was fine. I walked my bike and there was plenty to look at during the 5-7 min walk off the GAP.
Note there is no breakfast served. We enjoyed dinner at Centre Street Collective and scones and coffee at Basecamp for breakfast.
I’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"

The accommodations were exactly as described and the host provided clear instructions and was very responsive in answering questions. There was ample parking, a place to store bikes overnight if you want to cycle in the area (Cumberland is the ""hub"" for two great rail-to-trail rides), and the room was comfortable and clean."

Stayed a few nights","Cozy, comfortable, relaxing, and the place has a lot of character due to its close to 200 year history. Pam was personable and communicated well, including some of the ""quirks"" that come with an old place like the Bruce House, one of them being, for first floor rooms only, due to the technology of tankless water heaters, the hot water ""wake-up call"" mechanism does not always kick in. :). If a guest is going to book a first floor room, make sure and ask Pam how to wake up the hot water in the bathroom sink if it appears to be non-responsive to you. I'm a walker, not a driver, and the downtown area is within 10 minutes walk (there is a steep hill for about a block and a half, but I'm used to such hills where I live now - all part of getting some good exercise while I walk!). I'd recommend it to anyone. Oh, and a wide and rich collection of reading materials in the first floor hallway - bookshelves floor to ceiling!"

Stayed one night","I would return here in a heartbeat. The host thought of everything that might be needed during the stay, and excellent helps and instructions were on laminated sheets by the bedside. Parking was easy and ideal, even when coming back late at night. Cumberland was showing its best self with beautiful spring flowers and trees everywhere. The lodging shares an intersection with several churches and their parking lots, so there is an open feel to the neighborhood, and some hill/mountain views. I was awestruck by the historical buildings on the nearby streets, as I was by the high ceilings and ornate woodwork in the lodging. My room and bathroom were very clean and the place didn't smell ""old"", in spite of its age. The coffee service was great, and a bowl of candies was waiting in the foyer. I didn't spend time in the common room, but it was roomy and nicely set up. My room was on the first floor, and there were some nice window shutters that could easily be adjusted for privacy."

We were driving back home and wanted to find a quick place to stay so we were not driving through heavy rain. Pam was kind enough to accept lur reservation quickly.
The room itself was so cozy and inviting we really loved the design and careful attention to detail we received. The lobby was stocked and whimsical with a record player and complimentary port wine (with accompanying glasses) that my wife took advatange of upon arrival.
Also be sure to take advantage of the vintage record player in the common area with accompanying vinyls ready to spin! Play a few tunes of Elton John to get us going in the morning!
A final note do take advatntage of Pams “to do” list that ahe provides for you in the town of cumberland. You can not go weong with her selections."

Stayed one night","Fabulous find! After a cool, drizzly day biking, the water pressure in the shower was the perfect thing to warm me up! The room size was more than adequate and quaintly decorated…perfect for this building. Appreciated Pam’s dinner suggestion, and it was just a short walk to the Baltimore Street Inn (but remember, if you walk down the hill, you have to walk back up it!) The crab dip and crab cake were fabulous. Make sure you either leave room for the bread pudding with bourbon sauce, or take it back with you. There’s a microwave in the common area to warm it up. The value for this stay is more than reasonable compared to what you might pay at a hotel, and a lot more charming! Will definitely try to stay here if we’re ever back in Cumberland!"

Stayed a few nights","The quaintest little cottage and the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday reality with mountain views nearby. Every single thing anyone would need, while being away from home, was in Kay’s house. She has truly outdone herself and thought of everything. It was meticulously clean and well kept. A true home away from home. We thoroughly enjoyed the crisp fall mornings on the back porch with warm cups of coffee in our hands watching the squirrels and varieties of bird species come and go. It’s so relaxing and peaceful that it almost had us cat napping out there! The house isn’t far from the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad that runs a true steam engine train and takes you from Cumberland to the cute town of Frostburg. It’s also only an hour or less drive to MD, PA and WV for Fall foliage, state parks/waterfalls and ski resorts especially in neighboring Davis, West Virginia that are must sees. Overall lovely, comfortable stay and Kay’s hospitality is much appreciated."

The back yard had a fire pit, yard furniture and even a grill if you wanted to grill out. Unfortunately it was a short stay for us this time but having family in the area we will return more often and we will definitely use Kay’s place if the days are available. THANKS KAY FOR GOING FAR AND BEYOND TO MAKE YOUR GUESTS WELCOMED AND SATISFIED."

The space was clean, kitchen is fully stocked with utensils and cooking implements etc. and complimentary coffee ☕️ and I slept on what is likely the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever slept on in my life! The tavern downstairs was closed when I visited which I’m sad about because the menu looked great.
As a side-note; My fiancé twisted his ankle hiking before we checked in - so it was an adventure getting up the flight of stairs and showered but we still really enjoyed the space. Im adding this to note that if you have trouble navigating stairs or standing this space isn’t a good choice for you but otherwise it’s a great choice."

Clean. Comfortable. Convenient.
I’m giving this 9.5 stars out of ten: only downside is the shared laundry off the bedroom. (I’m a light sleeper.) But the owners have included a white noise machine to offset the laundry sounds. This place is otherwise perfect! Immaculately maintained and clean! You can walk to any of the local shops or restaurants. Be sure to check out the bookstore! 🤓"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful place to kick back and relax. I think it's about 1/2 mile from the bike/running trail, so if there are any races that start downtown, or if people just wanted to be really active without driving all over the place, this would be a great B&B to rent.
There are many different restaurants within a half-mile, as well as various little shops. In the summer/September there are a number of booths set up (on Saturday, anyway).
The place is new (2022), clean as a whistle, and nicely accoutred. The bed was comfortable, and the ceiling fans in the bedroom and living room were very nice as well. Couple all this with a full kitchen and a stylish bathroom, as well as a tall table with chairs next to the kitchen, and this place is a winner. It's also reasonably priced. (It also has a laundry area, which I did not use.)"

Stayed one night","This was a great last-minute find for me, after lodging plans fell through that were part of my plan to break up my drive home into two days. My only regret is that I did not stay at the Braddock Suite in Cumberland longer! A convenient short distance from the highway, this charming apartment is nestled in a quiet historic neighborhood which feels miles and years away from the hustle and bustle of Interstate 68. Wes’ apartment is a wonderful place! Check-in was a breeze, and as a bonus, I bumped into my neighbors as they were parking their car across the street. They were in from Nebraska for a nearby family reunion, and were staying in the other half of Wes’ two Corner Tavern Residences -- the Allegheny Suite. The neighbors were so nice! As were the folks I met in the neighborhood when I brought a snack and a drink to the outdoor tables still in place after the Corner Tavern & Cafe downstairs had closed. I enjoyed a gentle breeze and the pleasant ambience of the historic Cumberland neighborhood, while sipping on a refreshing beer. After a good night’s sleep in the Braddock Suite, I was ready to head back on the road again — though sad to leave the Corner Tavern Residences. Next time, I will stay longer and explore all that charming Cumberland, Maryland, offers!"

Right above the corner tavern - unfortunately it wasn’t open at night since we were in on a week day but we went for breakfast and lattes and it was SO good and the atmosphere was cozy. We were biking the GAP & C&O and they had a place for us to put our bikes in the foyer and packed us lunches at the tavern since we knew there wouldn’t be a ton of lunch spots on the stretch of trail we were riding that day. Would absolutely recommend it for any cyclists looking for a clean place with bike storage and nearby food!

Stayed a few nights","We walked in and I said:""The place is so clean with fresh paint on all the walls and trim, plus new pretty tile in the kitchen.""
It wasn't until I opened the book and saw the page of ""dos and don't s"" that troubled me. First, ""try to eat in the kitchen."" Really!! This is a vacation and the TV is not in the kitchen. Then I noticed there were no end tables or a coffee table in the TV room. No place to put my coffee or glass of wine while enjoying a movie. Then we sat down on the new sofa/futon and it was so uncomfortable. It looked great, but when I sat next to my husband I actually was sitting on a board in the middle with no padding. There was also a desk chair and another chair with a sloped foot rest, neither one comfortable. The TV was great!
Even though this was my first Airbnb, I thought it was inappropriate that I was responsible for stripping the bed, putting dishes in the dish washer, soring the towels, etc. before leaving.
I did talk to Wes on the phone because we had only two bath towels for four days and we finally did find them in the dryer in the locked wash room.
Needless to say we left a day early because it was not a fun/vacation place."

The home located close(walking distance) to the train station in an old historic building that has recently been tastefully remodeled. The manual was excellent and provided fantastic recommendations. Breakfast at the tavern downstairs was delicious.
We were here for the 1st leg of a C&O bike trip, and Cycles & Things bike shop is right next door. There were two bike hangers downstairs with space for more bikes in the foyer.
Wes and Helene were excellent communicators and extremely accommodating, especially as we were caught in a surprise April snowstorm (5”) on the 1st day of our bike trip.
This may be the best AirBnB experience I have had. Highly recommend!!!!"

Stayed one night","Honestly, such a beautiful AirBnb. The pictures do not do this place the justice it deserves. It was well designed, spacious, and very tasteful. I appreciated how clean the place was being a high-risk individual in these very unprecedented circumstances. Hotels are too much of a 'hot spot' for me so this was a miracle finding such a beautifully done spot close to our event."

Stayed one night","A top notch stay in Cumberland. We were biking the GAP trail and we enjoyed our stay in Cumberland. The apartment was modern, completely renovated, and very clean. We were impressed to find the place was much bigger than the pictures made it appear to be. The bicycle rack in the foyer and the easy check in process were added bonuses and made the stay go above and beyond our expectations. The bed was firm and we got a great evening of rest after 2 days of over 75 miles on the bicycles. We were also able to walk and ride to everywhere we wanted to go in Cumberland and we are looking forward to booking again in the future when we do another C&O trail ride to DC."

Stayed one night","Wes and Elizabeth were the perfect hosts. We were staying over at their place while driving long distance and it was the perfect stop over. Our only regret was staying one night! The corner tavern apartment was CLEAN nicely decorated and so accommodating. We stayed Saturday to Sunday so we didn't get to take advantage of the cafe downstairs but based on the raving reviews we would've been very satisfied. A gem of a place. The accomodations had clean new linens and towels and the kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans and silverware. You can tell Wes and Elizabeth really care about their guests with the care taken with the building. Check in was a breeze and the free street parking was vast making it easy to come and go. Book this place, you won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Steeple View flat was a very comfortable, clean, and beautifully appointed flat to spend several days. Kathyren provided great instructions ahead of check-in for how to access the flat and the availability of parking. She also provided advice about where to eat and how to access the hiking/biking paths nearby. The flat is located in central Cumberland, on a lovely hill above the river with the court house, many churches, and nice houses. Access to the flat from the street level was super easy, as was access to the flat, and street parking was readily available. While central, the flat was very quiet. The flat is located very close to both the C&O canal towpath and the GAP bike trail. I enjoyed my stay."

Stayed a few nights","This is THE best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in! Being in the historic district was a bonus for us, we loved being less than 2 blocks from where George Washington, Thomas Cresap and so many others important to the creation of our nation opened the frontier and created Cumberland. Everything in the space was so much nicer than expected. The bed was extremely comfortable. Lots of extra touches like lavender pillow spray and lotion on the nightstand along with numerous flavors of coffee and tea. We never moved our vehicle on Saturday as we were able to easily walk downtown to catch the train, eat at great restaurants and walk the historic downtown area. The neighborhood feels safe and we parked right in front of the door. As soon as we walked in we felt relaxed and welcome, It’s cozy, comfortable and clearly no expense has been spared. Every inch is spotless and Kathyren is very responsive. We will definitely choose this space when in the area again."

The amenities provided were nothing short of extraordinary. This Airbnb was equipped with more amenities than I had ever seen in any accommodation, including high-end hotels. Every detail was thoughtfully curated to enhance the guest experience.
The attention to detail and cleanliness of the entire space was impeccable. It was evident that the host took great pride in maintaining the property to the highest standards. The interior design was aesthetically pleasing and incredibly comfortable, making it feel like a true home away from home.

Inside the flat, it’s pristine, cozy and beautifully decorated. Kathyren has included so many extra touches to make the stay super comfortable and memorable.

Stayed about a week","Amazing! Kathyren was wonderful! She worried about me during sidewalk construction outside her house, ensured I maintained easy access to the residence, and made plans to ensure I wasn't inconvenienced. I was bowled over from the first time I entered the residence--so many provisions and beautiful accommodations! I felt right at home immediately. The location is quiet and ideal for quick walkable or bikeable access to the C&O Canal path and GAP trail or downtown Cumberland. Since I grew up in the area and didn't need as much info as someone who has never visited, I didn't need to call on her too often, but I knew she was there if I needed anything. She was most gracious and helpful whenever we had contact! I'm planning to stay here again whenever I return!"

The town is very interesting and the studio is very close to downtown and all it has to offer. We walked but just be aware that the area is old, a lot of work is being done in town and sidewalks are hit or miss, so if you are unsteady it is not super safe.
The studio itself is fine and the neighborhood historic and quiet.
Definitely will go back!"

It’s on the lower level of her beautiful house and has its own entry door on street level. We enjoyed so much about her place. First off, we slept extremely well. The bed was very comfy and the area was super quiet. There were amenities galore, tasteful touches all around, and useful information provided about the flat and the surrounding area. The location is very (VERY) convenient to the historic and playful parts of downtown Cumberland. Other helpful features included a well-equipped laundry room and electrical outlets everywhere. Our host, Kathyren, was easy to reach via text. Next time we’re in Cumberland, her place would be at the top of our list for accommodations."

We appreciated having a washer and dryer to do some laundry before spending the next few days on the road. The bathroom was large and extremely clean. We had everything we needed to prepare and eat a couple of simple meals and we slept well in a very comfortable bed. There was even a place to store our bikes, and rags to wipe them down with. And if you're not from the area, we highly recommend making a side-trip to the very moving Flight 93 National Memorial about an hour away."

We appreciated the “coffee station”, and there were also wine glasses and a corkscrew, as well as frosty beer mugs in the freezer - that we all that we needed! We loved the location of Kathyren’s place; it was a short walk to the historic section of Cumberland, which is full of restaurants and has at least one brewery and one bakery (both excellent!).

None of the excessive self-clean-up that you see all the time now, super friendly, super easy) - but it was just incredible in its beauty. Lovely old, thick walls, quiet despite being in the basement, beautifully appointed - I really wish we could have stayed longer. It was a last minute find and we were so lucky to have found her house. My husband enjoyed the shower and, while we didn't use them, the frosted beer mugs and ample night lights were adorable touches.
I just hope to go back for a long weekend soon."

We were very busy with class reunion activities and it was wonderful to come 'home' to a comfortable place to end the evening as well as a relaxing way to start our mornings. The apartment is beautiful and has all of the conveniences of home and then some.
The apartment is very clean and beautifully decorated. It is comfortable and inviting. The location was perfect for our reunion activities both in Cumberland and neighboring Ridgely, WV.
Kathyren was the perfect host with very open lines of communication leading up to our stay and on arrival. I knew she was available should anything come up.
I hope to visit again one day and highly recommend this place to any visitor to Cumberland."

After reading all of the reviews for Kathyren’s place, we decided to book it. We are glad we did. It is immaculate, and Kathyren thought of everything to make your stay as stress-free as possible. It is quiet andsafe, and is convenient to downtown restaurants and attractions. I will definitely (try to) book it again if I return to the area."

Our hostess included many little special amenities to make our stay extra nice; coffee, snacks, lotions, extra backup toiletries and the like. The location was quiet in the evenings and the bed was comfy. It is a private mini-apartment and just right for a short or longer visit for one or two to the area. We really enjoyed ourselves staying here and we think you will too!"

Apartment is very well lit, and spacious. Interior decor is well thought through.
Walking distance to very pretty historic downtown. The area is surrounded by mountains, so I suspect is it beautiful during fall foliage and plan to return then.
As lover of trains, I enjoyed hearing the trains regularly passing by.
For bicyclists passing through, there is storage space on the first floor.
For long term guest, the sink & fridge is very small, so just be aware."

The Airbnb was clean, quiet, and I felt right at home after long days at the office. The bed was super comfy, and the couch was a great place to kick back and watch some TV. Jamie was always quick to respond, and when I couldn't get the heater to work, she came by herself to fix it in ADDITION to leaving me a space heater in case things got cold again. The location made it easy to walk to restaurants or shops, but it was also just a short drive to lots of other places nearby! I highly recommend this spot to anyone staying for a weekend trip or an extended visit like I did. Thanks for a great experience, Jamie :)"

Very well decorated and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay very much. Jamie seems to know how best to make a property functional and lovely. I feel the apartment is bringing a positive vibe to Cumberland.
If I had anything to request , it would be two simple items. 1) provide wine glasses and/or glasses for beverages as well as a wine/bottle opener. And 2) it took me a bit to find what I considered the value-added part of town. I made a point to drive around more before leaving. There appears to be a neat downtown with several good looking restaurants. Be sure to cross over the canal to get to the downtown area. Very cute town. Wish I had more time to explore."

We especially enjoyed the outdoor seating area, where we could look out over well-cared for lawn and into the town under some pretty twinkle lights. We were able to cook almost all of our meals with pots, pans and utensils supplied and enjoyed eating in the formal dining room feeling. One of the girls staying on our trip who stayed in the fullbed, tried to check her mattress for a label because she enjoyed thr mattress so much. My only constructive feedback would be that it would be nice to be able to control the temperature ourselves."

Stayed with kids","Mark and Becky are terrific hosts. They live adjacent. They are present, friendly and social, but not obtrusive.
The house is older, but full of character. It is well-maintained to the extreme. It is furnished with pieces that fit its character.
The landscaping is amazing. The cottage’s hillside location presents a gardner with a variety of very tough sites with which to develop, but Mark & Becky have done an outstanding job with plant selection and maintenance.
Downtown Cumberland is a 12-minute walk. Canal Place is 20 minutes. Walking access to town is made via some steep city-maintained steps that are usable, but in poor condition. I would not use them at night without a headlamp or flashlight.
As mentioned, the cottage is located on a hillside. Long flights of fairly steep well-maintained steps must be negotiated from parking. If you have mobility issues or lots of heavy bags, this place may not be a good choice.
In all, our group of seven, age 1 to 67, loved it!"

It was super clean and well stocked with everything you could possible think of. There was a cute game room down in the basement, front porch where we ate our breakfast and played cards. The beds were comfortable, lots of closets and dressers to store your things. The dining area was incredible because they even supplied fine place settings to have a nice dinner on a large dining table. We felt like we were going back in time, staying at my Aunts house! We didn’t have a problem with the many steps but If you have problems with steps, this awesome house is not for you because it is literally on the side of the hill. It was soothing listening to the train running through this historic town. We would like to return some day and hopefully see more of this beautiful town and if we do we would love to stay again at Mark and Becky’s."

Stayed a few nights","Our experience with Mark & Becky was epitome Airbnb. Exquisite. The type that makes me want to travel more, meet more strangers, let life happen in new places.
After canceling our original reservation as we found out we could stay with local family, we contacted M&B the afternoon we were due to arrive in Cumberland as my partner had just tested positive for COVID. We were 3000 miles from home, at the beginning of a month-long trip, and needing to pivot majorly and quickly. They welcomed us with compassion and care, accommodating a same-day reservation and checking-in with us (in a thoughtful, kind, and not overbearing way) throughout our stay. Their concern helped me process and more fully experience the moment, and, on the night my partner’s symptoms were really scary, knowing they were up the hill was really reassuring and grounding.
Hopefully your time at Mark & Becky’s won’t be so eventful - and in that case, you’ll be happy to know that theirs is the cleanest (by leaps and bounds) Airbnb I have ever stayed in. They have lovingly and impeccably restored this beautiful old home, so you can have the best of both worlds - modern comforts while honoring and experiencing the history of Queen City. The gardens are magnificent. Take a swing at sunset. Find the church through the trees. Drink coffee with the birds on the porch.
Thank you thank you thank you, Mark and Becky. We are so grateful and so lucky. May the universe cross our paths again someday!!💜

The view of Cumberland is amazing and you are walking distance to downtown area with shops and restaurants.

Stayed with kids","What a charming house! We fell in love with Cumberland earlier this year but the experience of staying in a real historical place, cared for and valued by people, with heirloom pieces there - it adds a lot to the pleasure of the trips. The house is well located, you get to the heart of downtown in about 10 minutes (walking) and yet you are in a totally quiet residential area where nothing and nobody would bother you. The owners live next door and communicate most efficiently and friendly. We came in late and really appreciate the water and snacks kindly left for us in the kitchen. Come and enjoy, highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Sisters escaped for a weekend of biking on the GAP trail. Mark and Becky were incredible hosts and the cottage was just spectacular. Mark and Becky were quick to respond to our (many) questions and extremely helpful and accomodating every step of the way. From tips on where to store our bikes, where to eat, and super helpful when we arrived - they were truly amazing hosts. The cottage was wonderful - it was HUGE with gorgeous grounds with a spectacular view and a Zen Garden. We did get a workout getting bags to and from the cars - as we always overpack - but all of that so worth it for the amazing views. If you are a lover of old world charm with modern updates - you will be love the cottage. Highlights of the area included the biking of course - the Dig Deep Brewery - and Cafe Mark. Also if time permits consider the scenic drive up to Shanksville to the Flight 93 Memorial. Very moving. A FIVE STAR SISTERS trip all around. And we are picky and hard to please. :-) Thanks to Mark and Becky for everything."

Most importantly, Mark and Becky have revitalized an entire section of a city block. If you choose to stay here, and you really should, ask them about the history of their Airbnb. They are working hard to make Cumberland a better place. I just can’t say enough about this home and the hosts. We will be back next year and I look forward to seeing them again."

The cottage is very well maintained and full of quite helpful amenities including grill, fire pit, washer & dryer, iron, sun chairs & beach towels, toys, games, extra linens, hairdryer, hygiene items, snacks and bottles of water to greet each guest. The most enjoyable time was spent as a family in the Zen garden admiring the wonderful view of Cumberland and on either the front porch or side patio enjoying each other's company. Thanks for a memorable stay!"

The first impression when you walk in the door, you get that warm feeling of coming to your second home. The place is well stocked with amenities, with a wide variety of breakfast bars, coffee, candies, and snacks on the counter, which is a welcome addition to children who have traveled many hours. The cottage is immaculately clean and accessible, and it is stocked with travel-size soap and shampoo for those that forgot to bring theirs. Towels, blankets, and comforters are plentiful, there is also a washer and dryer for those that go through them more often. Mark and Becky are wonderful hosts, they're close enough to be attentive and responsive, yet give you plenty of privacy to enjoy your stay.
Overall, this is a wonderful cozy place that easily accommodated our family of 7. We thoroughly enjoyed our short vacation and looking forward to our future stay here."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re considering a stay in Allegany County, look no further!
Nestled into a wooded hillside, this historical home has been renovated with modern conveniences while maintaining its period charm and interest. It is well-appointed, spacious, cozy and comfortable. There is plenty of room for a big family. We especially loved having two bathrooms (unusual for historic homes). We took advantage of the shaded front porch, as well as the patio and grill. The hosts provided utensils, paper bags full of charcoal, lighter fluid and a lighter, making cookouts super simple. The property is also close to numerous scenic attractions and yummy eateries.
Recommendations: Western Maryland Scenic Railroad (be sure to chat with The Conductor), Toasted Goat/Frostburg (check out the museum), Dan’s Rock (panoramic splendor), Baltimore St. Grill (mmmm...crab dip), Ellie’s Deli (pack up your cooler!), County Club Cinema (a nice surprise!)
The pièce de résistance, though, was Mark and Becky. They are exceptional hosts! They (truly) go above and beyond to create a pleasant and memorable stay. For instance, we told them that this trip was a family getaway to celebrate our daughter’s 20th birthday. So, they asked if they could leave something for her (right?!). She was overjoyed to have a card, flowers and a personalized birthday cake awaiting her arrival! That was her first of many fond memories from this trip, but not the last time our wonderful hosts would wow us with their overwhelming kindness and generosity.
Trust, every thoughtful accommodation has been made with their guests in mind.
Please don't hesitate to book!
See you soon, M&B (and M ;) ),

If something were to go wrong, you would absolutely have cavalry a message away. And the view is nice, environment is quiet, and experience is unique.

But the house is not what made this stay better than 5 stars— the host made this feel like a private Bed & Breakfast. My wife and I relocated to DC just before the holidays, which meant because of VID19 we couldn’t go home safely to be with family. Becky and Mark cooked us a Christmas dinner, dropped it off at the front door and then checked in to make sure we enjoyed it. I’ve stayed at a ton of Air BNB’s and never have I had a host go so far above and beyond. If you’re looking for a great place in Western Maryland this one is it.

Group trip","Mark and Becky's place is a sweet and lovely home with an amazing view. The fall weekend we were there was beautiful and somewhat warm, and we loved sitting on the front porch and patio taking in that view, surrounded by colorful fall foliage in the yard and adjacent properties. The house is exceedingly clean - the above-and-beyond Covid protocols were also a huge selling point for us. The kitchen is well-stocked with cookware and utensils - very easy to prepare meals. It's comfortable and cozy and it was perfect for my husband and me and our adult daughter. And Mark and Becky are such gracious hosts and so kind. We appreciate all they did for us and we loved our weekend there!"

Stayed about a week",The Cottage on the Hill was a great place to stay while we visited family in Cumberland. The house was spotless when we arrived and welcoming after our long drive. The cottage is beautifully decorated and takes you back in time. The modern conveniences will make your stay very comfortable. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch looking at the city lights or watching the leaves fall. Mark and Becky are great hosts and we enjoyed meeting them. The cottage is on a quiet street but close to downtown. We will definitely stay with them on our next visit!

Mark and Becky were thoughtful hosts with a beautiful home that had a warm farmhouse feel. They live next door and waved hello/said hi while we were enjoying the private outdoor patio. We felt welcome from start to finish and look forward to coming back!

The house had plenty of space and all the amenities that we needed for our stay. Mark and Becky were very gracious hosts and live very close by if there is anything extra you may need. We highly recommend staying at the cottage if you are visiting the area. Our family is planning a return trip to Cumberland in the fall and the cottage on the hill will be our first choice.

It made me feel comfortable going and staying there during these uncertain times. I would very very highly recommend them and the place

Stayed one night","Appreciated the sparkling clean house and the very effective air conditioning when we arrived by bike from the nearby GAP trail. The road leading to the house is steep and required us to push our bikes the last two blocks, but the hosts had notified us in advance so we were mentally prepared for the challenge. We really appreciated the cold bottled water, snacks and secure protected area to store our bikes when we arrived. This house is a great value and a worthwhile option especially if social distancing is high on your list."

It was a pleasure to not have to pack linens, pans, dishes, etc. Mark & Becky, not only exceed expectation with cleanliness, but also with hospitality. There were snacks and drinks waiting for us with a personalized note. (That token of thoughtfulness meant so much to us.) The stairs down to the house definitely seemed intimidating, but it was well worth it and soon became no big deal."

Stayed a few nights","We booked Mark & Becky’s cottage on the hill to stay at during the HOG Rally that was scheduled in June. Harley cancels the rally but we came down anyway. The house was great and Mark and Becky were wonderful hosts. We arrived on motorcycles around 4:30. - hot and sweaty from the ride. We discovered cold water in the fridge snacks on the table. That put a smile on our faces :)
They went the extra mile as hosts during our four day stay, The cottage is adorable and had everything we needed.
Will definitely book with them the next time we visit that area.
Thank you Mark and Becky"

Stayed a few nights","We were very pleased with our stay. We thought the house, with its location surrounded by well-cared-for green areas and garden, and by many trees, was nicer that expected. It was comfortable, cozy, and a good value. Mark was very welcoming and ready to assist as needed from his house directly across the street. The house is very carefully decorated, and Mark and Becky have put a good amount of thought and effort to the hospitality provided to their guests. This is among the best few experiences I've had among tens of house rentals when it comes to overall hospitality and host attentiveness and attention to detail. We also found the location of the house to be better than expected in how close it is to the center of town and to various stores and restaurants."

It was roughly a 10-15 minute walk to downtown, but walking back up that hill to the house was a bit more than we had bargained for, especially since we hiked a lot previously. Depending on your specific trails, there were a lot of parks/hiking spots within a 10-45 min drive or so. Overall, the cottage was a great place for a long weekend away from the city."

Stayed one night","Mark & Becky's place was wonderful. The home is beautifully furnished and decorated, spotless and beautifully located convenient to trips into Cumberland and surrounding areas. We had come in for the funeral of a relative south of Cumberland. Mark & Becky were amazingly considerate hosts, greeting us with a sympathy card, and were very flexible with check-in and other arrangements to work around our needs to be at funeral services and other family gatherings. The home has a beautiful view of the entire town of Cumberland. Beds were quite comfortable and having two full baths really was a luxury. They provide a nice guide to local restaurants and attractions. We found the restaurant guide quite handy. We can't recommend this place highly enough."

Stayed a few nights","Mark and Becky made this space not just comfortable, but genuinely very nice. It was super clean, they provided snacks and beverages, and the view of Cumberland is excellent. The decor was charming as well! The house is near the end of a very quiet street that doesn't see traffic, so I slept very well with no outside noises.
Mark and Becky were always just across the street or a message away for anything I needed. Some hosts I have stayed with in the past have been TOO helpful and spent way too much time trying to socialize with me. That's not what most people want; Mark and Becky struck the perfect balance of being available yet, not at all bothering. Self-check-in was a breeze and
I will surely aim to stay here again on future trips, as I think this is perhaps the best place to stay in Cumberland for the value."

It’s definitely in walking distance to some nice spots to eat and the canal path, and the walk back up the hill provides some built-in exercise. Yes, there are stairs, but I didn’t find them a problem to navigate even while carrying luggage. The walkway down to the house is sturdy and well-lit. I would definitely stay here again, the hosts were very thoughtful and quick to respond to messages."
