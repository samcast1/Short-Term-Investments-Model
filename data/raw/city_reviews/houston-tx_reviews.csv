Stayed with a pet","We were displaced due to the Houston storm so stayed at Kelli’s place for 4 nights. We are in love with this Airbnb! I had the chance to meet Kelli at check-in and she’s a fabulous host. The house is super clean, updated and well-stocked. We have two small dogs so the secure backyard was very helpful. I highly recommend Kelli’s place!!"

Stayed a few nights","My business partner and I stayed at Kelli's to get some work done--unfortunately, we were too busy to enjoy any of Houston's many attractions or restaurants, but we did appreciate the nice view of the skyline from the front porch where there are comfortable chairs to relax. The place was perfect for our needs--clean and comfortable, with a large TV screen and table that we needed for our work. The place is nicely furnished with simple decor. The beds were comfortable, great shower, and the kitchen was well-equipped. Nice coffee maker and lots of pods. It was everything we needed for our work meeting and we would love to return next time we meet."

Stayed with a pet","Exceptional Host! Kelli Goes Above and Beyond.
I recently had the pleasure of staying at Kelli's Airbnb, and I can't say enough positive things about my experience. From the moment I booked until the day I checked out, Kelli was an absolute gem of a host.
First and foremost, Kelli's hospitality was unparalleled. She went out of her way to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. From providing detailed instructions for check-in to offering excellent local recommendations, Kelli truly went above and beyond to make me feel welcome.
One aspect that truly stood out was Kelli's flexibility with the check-out time, Kelli was incredibly understanding and accommodating, allowing me to check out later than usual without any hassle. This flexibility made my departure stress-free and allowed me to fully enjoy my last day in the area. If you're looking for a fantastic host who truly cares about their guests' experience look no further than Kelli."

Stayed a few nights","We went to visit our new granddaughter who lives on Shearn Street which is a very short distance from the Air Bnb. We walked over each morning and stayed until late each evening. The Air Bnb is in a safe neighborhood and we felt secure while walking. There was parking at the front door, with additional parking across the street. It was nice to have washing detergent available as we needed to wash clothes while visiting. We hope to return to visit this spring and will definitely try to book again at this location."

Her neighborhood is quiet. The train does comes by regularly but isn't obnoxiously loud or disruptive. In fact, it adds to the charm of the neighborhood. I met Kelli upon my arrival. She is very hospitable and made me feel right at home! We highly recommend booking at Kelli's Awesome Bungalow!"

Stayed a few nights","Kelli is a great host! Very responsive and attentive to any needs with quick replies. We were low on towels for the amount of guests we were bringing and she brought them over quickly within the half hour of contacting her and it was even midnight!
Great location, walkable brewery a block away and close to downtown and a lot of food and restaurants in the area. The house was a little quirky, You can definitely tell it was updated a little bit compared to the neighbors and the building must have been here a long time. The house was not as great insulated, we came here for Thanksgiving and the weather was great. Not too hot not too cold, definitely got chilly at night so we had to run the heater. In one of the rooms where the heaters are placed a little awkwardly, the heat blows down on you directly in the bed and right in your face. We had to adjust a little bit with the heat and how the house held the heat. Only super bummer at this location is only one bathroom to share and use."

Stayed a few nights","It turned out that this ""awesome bungalow"" was better than awesome. Being familiar with the Houston area I can testify that this place is a ""slice of heaven"". Despite the fact that it was raining and overcast the entire three days that we were there, this place made our visit exceptional. The bungalow felt like home. Everything about it was first class. The location could not be better as far as convenience but even the neighborhood was super quiet and chill. A highlight of our stay was the epic view of the city skyline while relaxing on the front porch. Kelli was the perfect host. This was our first Airbnb experience. We will never stay in a hotel again."

Place is great but just know there is only 1 bathroom in the master room. Not a problem for 4 guys and the couches are very comfy and easily sleep 2 people plus there is an air mattress for a 5th.
I am very happy with this stay and will reach out to Kelli in the future to book this exact spot again"

The bedrooms having a door joining them could pose a problem for some, but wasn’t an issue for us and our friends. Kelli was a great host, communicating well and followed through to make sure we arrived and were able to get in!"

Stayed a few nights","Great experience all the way around. Easy DIY check-in with keypad, parking right in front, diagonally across the street from a new brewery (but not so close there's any noise or riffraff), and very clean. Only consideration: it's a 2BR, 1 Bathroom, and the single bathroom is only accessible by walking through one of the two bedrooms. Wasn't an issue for us, but just so you know.
Extra amenity: host has a computer in the living room for use. We didn't need it, but very cool to have it.
Also great to have nice, big TV with Roku, including Hulu Premium. Perfect for our hanging-out-in-Houston weekend."

There is also an awesome art market within a mile or so and there is a brewery set to open a few months from this posted review which will be a great perk! Overall, Kelli’s place had all the amenities to make our trip comfortable. It is tastefully renovated and is quite spacious."

Stayed a few nights","Usually I have a great experience at my airbnbs and I’ve gone to a couple. But I can’t lie I just didn’t enjoy this airbnb at all. For starters if I wouldve seen the front of the literal shack not tiny home but shack we were staying in, I honestly wouldn’t have booked the stay with them. No pictures of the outside of the “tiny home” were in the listing at all. The pictures they have listed make the place look pretty decently sized but upon arrival it’s honestly not how I imagined. They used wide angle pictures and those are very deceiving , and definitely not accurate. Would say the shed was clean but we found some roaches, underneath the stairs and in the shower was a dead roach. As well as one of the pillows had blood stains on it and idk where that came from so we were not wanting to use the pillows they had provided us. Shower lasted about 5-6 minutes before it got super cold. So take a pretty quick shower. The bed was so uncomfortable we had to stay with family members elsewhere."

My only suggestion would be to possibly add more lighting to the outside of the tiny home. I found myself having to use my phone flash light to put in the code to the door.
Also, be very careful leaving out of the driveway it is very narrow & dark at night.
Overall I had a great experience and I will be back! I would totally recommend.

Stayed a few nights","The tiny home is adorable. It looks exactly like the pictures, the shower is bigger than I thought it would be. The place was very clean on arrival. Leo was very responsive and flexible with the changes I requested. Their dog is SUPER friendly and just wants to snuggle. A boil water notice was called for the city while I was there so the kettle in the kitchen came in very handy. I hadn’t realized there’s an induction cooktop in the kitchen so that was a nice surprise. My only advice when going up the stairs is watch the third step, my best friend and I had to make an effort to remember that one is just a bit higher than the rest 😅."

Nothing we couldn't do at home but we wanted a short getaway and double with the experience of Tiny house living and that we did. So cheers to some good host.

Rom was sweet and our little 8 month old just loved him. Check in was super easy! It didn’t smell great when we first walked in but once we turned the ac on, it was fine. It wouldn’t prevent us from booking again. Cute cute place! Would stay here again!!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very cute little spot for two people. They have everything we need, and the gentle giant dog. I was scared of him when I first saw how big he is but he is very friendly and gentle. The location can be a bit out there if you plan to go to downtown of Chinatown, but nothing too bad for a typical Houston drive. In the morning you can hear the birds chirping. Staying in someone’s backyard can be a little bit awkward but the host did a great job of giving us privacy. If I do a solo getaway I would consider this place as well because it has everything you need to just relax and chill."

I was able to manage fine because I'm short and nimble, but I can imagine for tall people it will be tricky and not comfortable. The availability of shows and movies (Netflix and Prime) on the TV was nice. The street was quiet and safe, I enjoy driving through the neighborhood, with lots of trees and big houses around. Leo was super friendly and accomodating. There is a big dog that will greet you when you park in the driveway, don't let his size intimidate you, it is super sweet and friendly."

Stayed a few nights","This is a cute older unit with ample space for 2 people. We stayed 3 nights. We didn’t use the kitchen, but it seemed well-equipped. The bed was firm and comfortable. The bathroom had everything we needed but could do with more towel bars/hooks. The unit was missing a hair dryer, but the host team dropped one off. You can park your car right in front of the unit, and there is a security gate in front of the entry door. The neighborhood was nice and felt safe. There were restaurants within walking distance. There was a little noise from upstairs and the street, but overall, it was quiet. The unit was fairly clean with only a few areas that could have been cleaned better. This is an older unit, and it is in need of repairs/renovation. The host team is proactive and seems to be receptive to guest suggestions and eager to address identified concerns."

Stayed a few nights","By far, the best kept secret in The Heights! I loved this place, especially the shower/bathroom! I felt the shower was better than any of the best hotels in Houston and I felt so pampered! The oversized tvs and kitchen were just wonderful! Equally inviting were the two private patios - just so well organized and decorated!
I got to witness the 2024 eclipse in totality and the experience was spectacular, but Nathan’s La Casita was right up there in feeling spectacular! I can’t wait to visit again.
Lastly, I felt the ambience and quality of the place relative to the price paid was not proportionate, so I felt compelled to leave Nathan an extra tip! This place deserves 20 stars out of 10, in my opinion"

Sheets, comforter, and pillows are all high quality. Truly zen aesthetic. Nathan communicates quickly and kindly. There are delicious snacks and FIJI water waiting for you when you arrive. I rate this place a 10000/10. I highly recommend staying here. 🙃"

Everything was so clean, new, and cozy, and his communication was spot on. I took advantage of the beautiful tub to read a book and relax.
He even had some Ferrero Rocher waiting on each pillow of the bed (my favorite chocolates).
It was exactly what I needed and I'm so glad I found this place for my trip. I recommend his place to anyone staying in Houston.

Stayed one night","This is hands down the best spot I've stayed in Tulsa in the last year since travel started in OK and the home has to be under $200 night to expense. This is the spot especially if you like being outdoors with 2 awesome spaces to work, have a glass of wine, relax, etc. By far the cleanest I have stayed in! Crisp white features with awesome design interior and exterior. Extremely cozy for 2 people. Amazing shower and tub (will try next time). Lots of unique goodies to comfort your stay (water, Cliff bars, chocolates, shampoo, conditioner, etc). Comfortable bed with extra pillows. Owners are close by if you need anything too. Enjoy your stay!"

Stayed a few nights","My La Casita experience was phenomenal and SUCH A VIBE!
Nathan was incredibly friendly and helpful, checking in throughout my stay. Secure parking, a seamless check-in process, and cozy, photogenic rooms made me want to live here! (lol) The comfy bed, plush linens, and spacious walk-in closet exceeded expectations. The well-equipped kitchen facilitated easy breakfast cooking, and I had everything I needed.
The divine bathroom had an amazing waterfall shower and an incredible deep soak bathtub with a private view of plants, and I even saw little squirrels playing and a neighborhood cat tiptoeing across the fence during my morning bubble bath.
On my last morning, I enjoyed soaking up the sun while lounging in the hammock on the porch, reading a book. Nathan is one of the best Airbnb hosts I've had and the space perfectly matched the photos. Without hesitation, I’d stay here again; the thoughtful design and comfort were evident throughout.
Thanks again for an amazing stay!"

Fresh plants in every corner, beautiful modern kitchen, and the bathroom was truly my favorite part with the built in soaking tub in the wet room. Nathan is such an intentional host and it shows — from the safety features for the sliding doors, the easy pull down blinds, the lovely bubble bath provided for the tub, and the super comfortable bedding that smelled oh so fresh. Also he was super friendly and always responded in a timely manner. This is my new go-to spot whenever I’m traveling to Houston and I would highly recommend this listing to other guests."

And yet it's in a quiet residential neighborhood, which made it great for relaxing on the couch, working, hanging out in the outdoor areas, or just getting a good night's sleep. The fast internet and amazing spa-like bathroom were also highlights.
Nathan was a very accommodating host and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We highly recommend La Casita!"

There were so many amenities and special touches like a basket of snacks, water bottles, stocked coffee bar, laundry room with plenty of laundry soap and dryer sheets, a ping pong table in the garage, multiple bicycles, exercise equipment with weights, a pack and play, high chair, portable fans, fully stocked bathrooms with lots of toiletries. The primary suite is very roomy with a beautiful ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet. The outdoor patio has multiple seating areas and a wall with greenery that can serve as a backdrop to take photos. There are walking trails right behind the house and a park nearby too.
As a host, Vivian was very professional and with her communications, instructions, and always prompt with her responses.
Highly recommend!"

I got there before 10pm but the front desk was closed. Find out that the front desk was closed at 7pm. I contact Alex and she responsed right away and send self check in instruction which is easy. You just need to go through the parking gate (code provided) and get a key from the lockbox. So far i really like the place. I stay there for two weeks for business. There is gym and laundry there. The room has kitchen, fridge and Microwave. The place is closed to all kinds of restaurants. I recommend to stay."

After you host Airbnb for a while you get lazy, so please for future guest , clean your rooms, they had broken dishes and dirty silverware. Besides that it was exactly like pictures and the host responded fairly quickly, they seemed robotic like , maybe in the future have more realistic compassion. And the host also blamed nose complaints on me and my husband , I’m pregnant and he works a lot we are quiet people. The place had a lot of smokers and was very stinky at times, the room itself had a nice tv and everything worked well inside the unit. Overall it’s very over priced but that’s the economy."

The apartment was well equipped with kitchen utensils, everything was clean, the air conditioner was quiet and worked wonders, the shared laundry room is easy to use and I never needed to wait for a machine. No noise from the neighbours whatsoever!
Alex was very quick to answer my questions. The front desk ladies were also super helpful and friendly.
If I ever come back to Houston, I'm definitely staying again."

You can’t check in until 4 pm and I was told if I want to check in early, I would have to pay $35. I wish they would update that in the description so people can decide. By the time I was told about the time, I have already made the payment which means if I change my mind, I wouldn’t get my money back until 7 to 14 days after. And I need something asap. That’s the only thing."

Stayed a few nights","From both arrival and departure: the location of the listing was both peaceful and private. I never had issues with the tenants or the level of noise outside. For those significantly older, the close proximity of the vehicles exiting to the main highway may find this troublesome (I sleep like a log). To accommodate for the high temperatures, the room is cooled to close to a freezing temperature. I am used to hot weather but I did not pay too much attention to the room temperature. I did decide to do one load of laundry before my flight only to realize the front desk provides laundry detergent but not the dryer sheets. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and I would not mind traveling back to stay at this listing as the peace of mind of my rental vehicle behind a gated enclosure was great."

The entire hotel was kept super clean. Air conditioning worked. Bed was super comfy too
Cons the shower water pressure was SUPER low which didn’t make for a good shower, and one night I didn’t have my swipe key with me there was no after hours support I drove back to my work and got my key. Other than those two things it was really nice."

Restaurants, gift shops, bars, and coffee shops were all an easy 10-20 min walk away and the neighborhood itself was beautiful. The apartment was clean and well-furnished for the two of us. The only note I want to make is that there is a downstairs apartment below this one that was occupied while we were there. The tenant seemed nice and wasn't disruptive, but we could sometimes hear talking or coughing from below and I was worried at times we might be too loud just walking around. That said, it didn't pose much of an issue for us and we would gladly book again."

Owner was very responsive to an unusual situation that was not their fault - we arrived to find a raccoon sleeping in front of the door. We didn't want to approach it because raccoons potentially spread rabies, so we called the owner. Within less than 10 minutes, a representative showed up and humanely encouraged the raccoon to move along. Very responsive and effective response to an unusual situation, which we very much appreciated."

Everything an average traveller needed was already ready and within reach (i.e. extra pillows, some toiletries, plates and silverware, etc). Plus, the check-in/check out process was super easy and simple, & I loved the bed!!
Overall, I enjoyed my mini-vacation out there and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy place like this. :)"

It is quiet. Comfy bed. Fresh, not tired linens. The small kitchen, which we prepped several breakfasts in before walking the Heights had any equipment we needed to cook. Easy to work in in spite of being small. Will come again for all these reasons. Lamar is communicative, helpful and made this anotger smooth stay for us."

Stayed a few nights",My husband and I were back in Houston to visit a nearby family member in the heights. We have stayed in a different house under the same host. Were very happy that time so we were comfortable booking one of her properties again. This place so beats any hotel you could stay in. Clean as a whistle top to bottom. It feels like home. It is basically a quaint small house with all you can want. A cozy living room for a morning coffee. A well appointed lovely small kitchen and attached dining area. The bed was comply and sheets as fresh as can be. We love that the place was nested at the back of a driveway making it feel private and quiet. The Heights is a charming residential neighborhood. We hope this awesome living space is free for us to reserve the next time we come back. It would be our first pick.

Stayed a few nights","I typically take a moment to review all of the stays taken; this visit is no different. Not having been to Houston in the past, I spent significant time searching for a place to stay. I was travelling with my girlfriend and was happy with the choice to stay at Lamar's place. My daughter recently moved to Houston and my first visit with her was pleasant. The ""Heights"" offers a number of restaurants and bars and the neighborhood is ideal for a morning or evening walk. There are a number of options within walking distance to grab a morning coffee. Regarding the unit itself, I found it as advertised. Being from New England, we began to refer to it as the ""cabin"" given its resemblance to a Maine lakefront cabin we would often frequent. The unit itself is ideal for a couple or single and for shorter stays. We spent little time in the unit, having spent most of our time outside or with my daughter at her home. We never used the stove but it is dated. My girlfriend has some physical limitations which created somewhat of a challenge in the small bathroom and accessing the tub/shower. She also needed time to climb the stairs to enter the unit. The TV was difficult as well, not having your typical cable hookup like we are accustomed to. Thankfully the weather was ideal so TV was not a priority but evenings were focused on Netflix rather than ESPN (no college football or golf). Parking was not an issue. There were others staying in the home and it was very quiet. Overall, I would stay here again."

Our host was absolutely 💯 helpful and never had to wait on a response. The app (digital key) we had to download was a little confusing, but he stayed on the phone until we made it to the front door.
I will definitely stay here again.

Host was very responsive and helpful, the place was clean and smelled great and overall had a really sleek modern vibe to it with the mood lighting and everything plus the bed comforter was very comfortable, I got a good nights sleep. It’s the perfect spot for a weekend get away with your significant other and is right in the heart of downtown with plenty of things to do around you within walking distance or a quick 5 min drive/Uber. I love that there was a balcony so you can get a nice look at the beautiful skyline view the place had to offer. I definitely will book with this Host again when I come to town. I didn’t get a chance to use the amenities but there is a really nice gym and swimming pool as well. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Stayed a few nights",Happy that the unit matched the pictures. Was situated relatively close to highway and restaurants. Directions to unit and entry were easy to follow. Parallel parking against fence was tight and maneuvering to get out was challenging given where other cars parked and we had an SUV. The main issue we had was that there was visible black mold in the bathroom. This is a health hazard and clearly been present for some time. We vacated the unit. Thomas offered to move us to another of his properties but that unit was more expensive. We were already being inconvenienced and he wanted to charge us more money to move to another of his units that was currently unrented. This unit should not have been available to rent in that condition. We are certain that Thomas wouldn't live with black mold in his own residence. He argued that it wasn't mold but I sent pictures to him and Airbnb; the latter agreed with our assessment. It was unfortunate since it was otherwise a nice unit.

While the parking situation proved a bit tricky due to a narrow entrance and tight spaces, with some adjustments, it was manageable. Additionally, the toilet presented some flushing issues, but Thomas was incredibly responsive and made earnest attempts to address the matter promptly. Despite the persistence of the issue, Thomas' attentiveness and willingness to help were commendable. Overall, the stay was enjoyable, with only minor parking and toilet hiccups that didn't overshadow the positive experience."

It was spacious floor layout with a gorgeous design, strong A/C system especially in this 100 degree weather, awesome TV, and the design of the shower area was remarkable.
We truly were able to enjoy ourselves and the host, Thomas, is responsive to all needs. I would recommend this suite for anyone trying to go on their own getaway or traveling into Houston!"

Stayed about a week","The Bonaparte Suite was beautiful and looked just like the pictures. My husband and I were there for his cancer treatments so we stayed for 7 nights. There was great water pressure in the shower and the bed was quite comfortable. The only drawbacks for us were the lack of spare anything. We needed more than one dish towel, more than one hand towel and more than two facecloths. I feel sure if we had seen them, our hosts would’ve been happy to give them to us, but we never saw them. That in itself could be a very good thing as they gave us plenty of privacy. However, I didnt feel comfortable going to their door. No washer had been mentioned in the amenities but I didn’t see it mentioned that there was no dishwasher. I don’t mind washing dishes by hand but i need somewhere to dry them or a drain board. Overalll, it was a nice place and a good value"

Stayed a few nights","We were in Houston for a wedding in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is very cute and walkable and the apartment is clean and fairly spacious for a 2br. We did find it to be lacking a lot of basic amenities like toiletries in the shower and items in the kitchen. My biggest issue with the apartment is the location and access. If you plan on having a lot of things delivered or calling a lot of Ubers, expect to have to walk to meet them or to have to pick things up off a neighbor’s porch. The entry to the house is in a back alley that no one can ever find, which was an issue given all the storms. We really struggled to get people to find our “front door”."

It is spacious and light, but shades protect against the sometimes too much Houston summer sun. It is spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, but also comfortable and relaxing. Everything worked perfectly, especially the AC, which, sorry, is important during these 100 degree days. Having 2 bathrooms was a real luxury as was the really cool walk-in shower. It is located in a quieter, walkable part of Houston’s vibrant Heights neighborhood with a mixture of lovely historic homes and gorgeous new ones, close to great restaurants, parks and all amenities. We weren’t tourists, but if you are, there is no better location for easy access to the museum district, fabulous zoo, shopping, medical center, and downtown. In my mind, this is the “Goldilocks” place, where everything is just right! Can’t wait to stay at Laura’s again!"

It was so clean, well decorated with great bathrooms, and spacious enough for our two girls to hang out and place their things. It sits in a quaint side of town with everything you need close by, including quick access to downtown and the local aquarium. There are great walking/running paths and a play area close by. We were able to find a community pool for the kids as well. There are so many yummy ice cream shops nearby to choose from. While our teammates stayed at the Omni and pretty much stayed in, we enjoyed the local area and came back to the comfort of our home away from home. We will definitely be back next year or anytime we visit. I highly recommend this adorable home!"

Stairs are quite steep to reach the second floor as well as to step down into the bathroom but the shower is amazing. Host makes you take out your own trash and clean dishes before check out even though there is a $40 cleaning fee.

The towels were easily accessible and in plain view. The bathroom was very clean and well thought out. It's very cute just be mindful if you are on the taller side you might have to duck. It was a very cool space we really enjoyed our time there.

We (my fiancé & I) were comfortable like it was home. I would definitely stay here again. The host was very responsive & also checked on us mid stay to make sure we had everything that we needed.

Stayed a few nights","Wow, what an amazing little place! Space wise, it was economical, but never cramped, with a comfortable bed and in a very quiet, peaceful area (epescially considering how conveniently close to the airport it was). Bathroom was very nice, the standout being the shower, which consisted of a broad rainfall overhead shower head, in-wall sprayers, and an adjustable head, which could all be easily switched between. The shower was incredibly roomy, easily big enough for 2 people. Kitchen well furnished.
Our host and her partner were both incredibly responsive to our needs. We notified them of a very minor issue, and even then, they responded promply and arrived in person to address and fix it less than 15 minutes later.
In short: A very cozy stay, with an amazing price for the airbnb and its location (around 15 min from IAH). In addition, the hosts are incredibly friendly, responsive, and considerate. I'd highly recommend this location, doubly so for anyone who needs to be close to IAH!"

Also when we first got there one of the remotes battery was dead and the host went and got a new battery that same night which was pretty cool. There wasn't any kind of closet or spot to put our clothes which kinda sucked but we made it work. overall realy enjoyed our stay!

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my stay here, it was small and a great location right next to the airport. The lawn was not mowed and at night the neighbors played loud music. I didn’t feel the safest since there was only one deadbolt. Also wish this was listed as a separated room since there seems to be 3 different Airbnb stays in this one house. Didn’t have any main issues other than the trash can in the kitchen is super small and out grew it on the second day. Also the downstairs was super hot and stuffy compared to the bedroom. Very cool when I slept but any meal making or watching tv downstairs was uncomfortable. There was a slight slip up with me finding a dirty knife with crusty white stuff on it inside the drawer. Witch seems like a total accident and understandable since there is a lot to take account for with having a listing. There were only white bath towels… I was so worried I would stain one! Definitely a tight space but gets the job done for a good price!"

Stayed a few nights","This place has the unique factor dialed to a 10! It definitely should be noted that it is a MICRO living space. Like New York small, the kitchen was well equipped for the size and the bed was very comfortable, it also has the best looking shower I’ve seen in a AirBnB so far.
The location is about 20ish min north of downtown which was a little far for me, but not horrible. There is not a dresser or chest for clothes so you will be living out of your suitcase during the stay and it’s not made for people that are vertically blessed #tallpeopleproblems.
Overall I think it’s a great bargain and would recommend this place for a quick trip to H-Town."

The other hiccup was that you had to log in and out of your different Netflix , Disney + etc .. accounts because there wasn’t an account provided."

The stairs are indeed steep! But there are several bannisters, lots of good lighting, and it adds to a unique layout that I’ve never experienced before but very much enjoyed!

Stayed one night","This is a cute little place with a treehouse feel. The stairs going up to the bedroom are nearly vertical, so beware if you have trouble climbing regular stairs, as these are very steep. We thought it was fun! The decor is really lovely. The kitchen was well equipped and even had coffee and tea selections available. The shower has several different sprayers, which made it feel like a luxury hotel. The instructions on how to access the place were very clear and we appreciated that we could check in late."

Stayed a few nights",I was in Houston for a conference and this veryncute tiny house was the perfect place. The place is very nicely decorated and the atmosphere was pleasantly peaceful. Rebecca was very responsive to my needs and even checked on me to make sure I was ok. My favorite part of my stay was the shower. It was heavenly! I absolutely loved it. It is a tiny house and you will need to be able to climb ladder-like stairs to the bedroom and bath. I would definitely recommend it. It was a very uniquely fun place to stay. I am very glad I did.

We hope to stay there again soon.

Stayed one night","I really enjoyed our stay! It was very well decorated and a great layout of the space. I do think it was a great value but there were a few things that disappointed me about this listing:
1) the house was a new build in a calm neighborhood of old brick ranches and it stuck out like a sore thumb
2) we were hoping to doordash some food to the airbnb while we got ready for our event and there were no restaurants around us (just fast-food and gas stations)
3) there was a smell in the space that they were attempting to remedy with air purifiers and air fragrances. We got used to it once inside but upon first entering, it was off-putting.
All in all, it is a good space but i thought it might be helpful to know the negatives so you can decide if those are important to you."
