Stayed a few nights",Perfect place to stay if in town for a track meet or softball game ... actually any Duck sporting event as M Knight Arena and Autzen Stadium really aren't that far away to walk to either. Great restaurants just a block away including fantastic ice cream at Prince Pucklers. Eric's place was as advertised. Very easy to check in and out. Eric accommodated an early arrival time. The place was great ... had everything you would need. Very safe neighborhood. Would certainly stay here again on my next Eugene adventure.

Bed was comfy, shower a good size and plenty of towels for us and, a considerate touch this, for our dog too - nice that the host take account of the frequent wet weather and need to clean/dry off a pup!

The bed and bedding were high quality and comfortable - everything about the studio apartment is new - were we one of his first customers or does he just pay that much attention to detail? I’d love to come back!"

Stayed one night","Myself, Husband, and two golden retrievers stayed her for 1 night. The dogs loved the fully enclosed backyard and so did I for peace of mind. There was lots of outside deck space to sit on and enjoy as well. The interior was tight, I wish there was a microwave. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was tiled and big. There is only one air conditioning unit that didn’t fully satisfy the need of the space and keep us cool. However, the reason I picked this place was for the backyard which was 10/10."

It was beautiful and clean.
Towels, shampoo, body soap, coffee, coffee, tea, electronic kettle, etc. are the same as hotels.
It takes a little time to get hot water in the shower, but it will definitely come out w
There are several entrances.
The entrance for Airbie
The host will be guided, so be sure to check in advance.
It was a little hard to find on the Google map, but it is a blue house on the corner of E 19th and columbia."

The one thing that was gross was no top sheet on the bed, just a bottom fitted sheet. Since there was nothing in between me and the cheap blanket that clearly was previously used a lot and not washed, I slept in my clothes. I decided next time to increase y budget, and expectations."

As a single female traveling alone, I felt extremely safe both in the studio itself and being able to reach him, at any point, for anything. It was a great experience all the way around. Super grateful for Eric! I do have to say, to the person who left a note on the loud/partying surroundings (only negative review I saw on this property), stay farther away from campus next time. It's not Eric's/property's fault..
Highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Spent a night here on our road trip to Washington. We arrived fairly late, under poor weather conditions (freezing rain). Thanks to the helpful instructions and communication from Eric and his co-hosts, it was extremely easy to find the studio and unload.
The studio had some nice touches to it. Particularly, we found that the heated flooring worked much better than anticipated, given how cold it was outside. There were also some clever additions, such as cards and games to keep guests occupied. You will also find very reliable Internet and media streaming. These are some of the things you typically won’t find in a standard hotel.
The biggest perk for us, was how well-priced the listing was, given that we were provided amenities generally found outside this price range. We were all comfortable throughout our short stay, and our dog enjoyed every last bit of the private back patio/yard. This will definitely be in our list for any future visits through Eugene.
Thank you!"

But later in the week there was somebody else that parked in the driveway. Which ended up causing us to panic and our door was knocked on several times and woken up so that they could move because the street was filled up so we parked in the driveway behind them. There are also frat houses all around the house, so all we heard all night was a booming base of music that was blasting."

I greatly appreciated that my dog and I were able to have a small yard to ourselves, what an amazing perk!
The coffee pods, extra blanket for the dog, soft blankets, and numerous other small touches really made me feel comfortable staying here.
It also needs to be worth mentioning how wonderful this location is! You can walk almost anywhere from the campus, to grocery store, to some of the most amazing restaurants and bakeries in Eugene!
I will for sure be in the area again and hope to stay at this place in the future."

Lots of built-in storage allows for what could be “cozy” to feel spacious because you can put your things away and keep the floors clear. We did fine with 2 Greyhounds and 2 adults. Bathroom had a nice large shower with skylight. We didn’t stay long enough to enjoy the deck, but it was a nice space too. Appreciated the parking spot off the road. Easy access to the home and quick/easy communication with the host."

Stayed with a pet","Would not have been able to stay another night. The small studio space is tastefully done and clean, with a fully fenced in backyard area that was great for our small dog. Host communication was great and we appreciated the option to check in early. But the space is so small that it was hard to even open up our airplane carryon size luggage, and the dorm room fridge was tiny. No kitchenette (sink, hot plate, microwave) but I knew that going into it. Unfortunately, the window unit AC was not able to keep the space cool overnight and when I opened the windows and backdoor to let the cool night air in at 3 am, constant train, car, truck, and people noises made it impossible to sleep so I had to shut everything again. The location is 2 doors down from several restaurants that stayed busy until late, even on a Monday night. Since we didn’t have any need for proximity to the university or partying late, if I had it to do over, I would’ve stayed outside of town in a bigger place for less $. But probably a good location for a solo traveler who needs a short term stay, has no need to cook, and is a heavy sleeper."

Stayed a few nights","Geoff was very responsive and quick to answer any questions we had. For us, the neighborhood was perfect- we could walk to many places, it was very quiet at night and easy to get around. The unit was just what we needed- a studio with nice amenities- very comfortable bed, nice shower, extra towels were available if needed- Geoff provided a list of recommended restaurants, which was also helpful. We had a little trouble finding the rental unit but that was because we arrived later at night- otherwise, we would have been fine. We would definitely return to this rental if available when we travel to Eugene- perfect for 2 people!"

Stayed one night","Geoff is a good and proactive host. I'm sensitive to perfumes and scents, especially those that seem to last forever and sometimes use nanoparticles. But Geoff's description was accurate: his cleaners use isopropyl mixed with dishwasher soap and nothing else, and scents were not a problem.
The place is cozy, with good split-duct heating, a marvelous enclosed shower, and a bathroom fan with select-a-time switches, so you don't leave it running inadvertently. (You need a bathroom fan in Eugene, with its high humidity, to clear out mist when you shower.) The microwave is a little low and hard to see in, but it works well.
The location is excellent, in a quiet, upscale residential neighborhood about seven blocks from the University. It's a long walk or short drive to Beppe & Gianni, a classic-style Italian restaurant in a converted home, which makes its own pasta.
The studio lacked Kleenex, bag racks and a shoe rack, but this is minor stuff. We would stay there again."

In addition, tucked into a beautiful and quiet neighborhood, it's an excellent location in walking distance to a small grocery store, some great little eateries on 24th and Hilyard, the University, and restaurants around 19th & Agate.

Too many animals, ( 2 BIG pups) too many distractions. I booked Geoff's place impulsively, and it was great! Super solid and safe neighborhood, attention to detail. And yes, the King mattress was amazing. Linens on point! Cute SMEG fridge, all the amenities. Ad is exactly as advertised. Solid 10- it's on my go to list for all things future. xoxoxo"

The home is located within walking distance to fun restaurants. We had the best pizza at McMenamins. We enjoyed the Amazon trail. We rented Electric Bikes at Eugene Electric Bikes. The Willamette river trail was glorious. The small outdoor space was a great spot for our morning coffee, evening wine and appetizers. Thank you for sharing your sweet studio.

The check-in and check-out process were the easiest I’ve experienced at any Airbnb I’ve stayed at before.

Stayed a few nights","This is a great location for us. Our daughter lives only 5 minutes away with her kids and 2 cats. My husband is very allergic to cats, so each time we visit Eugene, we stay in airbnb's. This was the most convenient and walkable place we have stayed so far. I was worried that it would be too small, but we did great. The back yard is a lovely oasis where the provided rockers made a wonderful place to drink our (provided) morning coffee. Husband is a little unsteady and uses a cane, so the street parking, paved driveway and easy access through carport made it super easy for him as well as getting our rollerbags in. Will definitely stay again when we visit."

The water pressure is pretty weak and the water heater must not be high…my shower was disappointing and I had to make it quick. I didn’t even bother the second day. And there is no kitchen. They have a setup for coffee with a kettle and French press (makes a wonderful cup) and cute coffee mugs. But no way to clean it between uses. Maybe a Keurig or Nespresso machine would suit the space better.
Really cute sitting area at a beautiful wooden counter that looks out into their nicely cared for backyard."

The bathtub is deep and luxurious and the bed is so comfortable! Plan to eat at least one meal sitting at the little bar looking out on the backyard. (It’s especially nice after a hard day!)

Stayed with kids","Cleanliness is one of the biggest factors in whether an Airbnb is comfortable and relaxing for me and my daughter. I was impressed with the lack of dust, even on the decor, but mostly the lack of hair on floors and sinks, etc. from previous guests. There was no mildew or dirty grout in the shower/tub. I did not cringe in my bare feet. Kudos to McKenzy and Ian's cleaner! I imagine that there is a lot of varying opinions on what makes a bed comfortable; but for me, I do not enjoy sinking into a hole on overly soft/memory foam types of mattresses (that tends to hurt my back). The mattresses here were not like that - they were not too firm, but not squishy. The linens were soft and were freshly cleaned. A bonus was that either they have a water softener or the water in Eugene is just not as hard as where I'm from. There was not calcium/residue on any of the dishes or silverware. And I am grateful for the responsiveness and care from McKenzy, as well - prior, during, and after our stay."

Stayed with kids","This house is perfect for family gatherings- we had a big group (5 adults, 2 kids) and 10 guests one day... and we couldn't have possibly felt more comfortable! The space is well-decorated, updated, and makes you feel right at home. The washer and dryer is a huge plus (for... you know, life with kids...), the games were plentiful, the kids toys were a great hit, and the kitchen was well-stocked with essentials... and when we asked for something (kitchen tongs), they were provided within an hour. That level of attention is unheard of! This house, these hosts (including co-hosts), and this location will be our #1 choice for all future Eugene trips, and should be yours too. I cannot provide a higher recommendation... and I should know, as I am a super-host myself!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful home and responsive hosts. Easy drive to town, but in a lovely quiet wooded area. Great trail nearby for getting kids out on nature walks and a backyard that is a dream (though we definitely didn’t let our kids run around without us because of the small “bridges” in the back that they decided were pirate planks). The inside was spacious and fit our family of four very well with room to spare. Really lovely style and modern furnishings and appliances and we appreciated the attention to detail like kid friendly plates and cutlery. The 4 year old enjoyed the Disney movies included :) It was immaculately clean and kept very cool even on an 80 degree weekend. Loved how organized everything was and easy to find what we needed.
Our only tip for future guests is that if you have young children who nap during daytime still, there are no blinds, just pretty thin curtains but the area is pretty shaded."

It is extremely clean, cozy, and the pump heater kept us warm while we hung out, watched football, read books, and didn't do much...everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) was closed or we would have been out and about. It's a great location and nice and quiet. It was dangerous to even walk outside because the ground was so slippery, we did go out to eat at the one place that was open, and saw people falling down and cars sliding and fishtailing, scary stuff. The place has everything you need and Monica's communication was excellent. We have family in Eugene so we visit often. If availability allows, we'll definitely come back here. Thank you Monica!!"

Stayed a few nights","Lucky 13 is a beautiful, well-thought-out apartment. Though the street is busy, and traffic is fast (I parked around the corner rather than in front) the locked gate and private entrance made this apartment feel safe and secluded. So much thought has gone into this space and it really has everything. When I asked to add a night onto my reservation Monica took care of it and only charged one cleaning fee for my whole stay. I will definitely book again. My advice for people who don't wash their hair every day is to bring a shower cap, as the rain/waterfall style showerhead makes it difficult to avoid wetting hair, and if you are fragrance sensitive, ask ahead to have the oil diffuser removed. This was a great find. I do feel lucky to have been a guest!"

It appears squirrels run along the fence line, causing the neighbors dog to bark at the critters early morning and in the evenings. Road was a little busier than I would have liked, but convenient to what seemed to be a main artery of the area. The unit appeared well stocked and was cozy."

(The houses on the block are not well lit and I could not see the house numbers.) However once I found the right path, everything matched the pictures in the listing. I really appreciated that I could check myself in since I arrived close to 10PM due to my flight being so late! I felt very secure at this location with the gated entry and private entrance. The space is well insulated and I couldn't hear any traffic from the street, so it was very peaceful and quiet. The space is efficient and well designed. The bed was very comfortable.

The sky lights etc add natural sunlight to the space stocked on par with a four or five star hotel. Its on 13th that has a bike (I brought a folding bike) path directly into to the university and town - about a mile - walkable and bikeable so the location is excellent.

Stayed a few nights","The Lucky 13 Studio in central Eugene is wonderful in every respect. It is well located, obviously quite new (with amenities like dimmers or most lights, new very effective heat pump/air conditioner), a small but complete kitchen, a very comfortable queen sized bed, and a nice bathroom, with washer and dryer. There is even a small patio seating area outside to enjoy your coffee, or a glass of wine. The studio is small, and could not accommodate more than 2 people sleeping, but there is a love seat and a couple of stools at the kitchen bar, so having a friend or two stop by for a coffee or a drink would be possible, albeit cozy. I could go on about this lovely place, but will add just one more comment which is the vaulted ceilings give a great feeling of spaciousness, despite the fairly small footprint. The ceiling also has a pair of large skylights so the whole place is bathed in terrific natural light during the day. Be aware though, you’ll have a hard time sleeping in or taking a nap if you require darkness for sleeping. I don’t have that problem and slept in with no problem, and it was actually very nice to wake up to the daylight. The host, Monica, was very quick and responsive to a couple of questions I had."

Stayed a few nights","I come to Eugene often to work at the U of O library and this is my favorite airbnb in Eugene. It takes a lot to make me come back to a place and this one has it all. Lisa is a great host who kindly let us in a little early when my husband had a zoom appointment and needed to use the Internet. I love the location on an alley back up against the trees and the hills. It has felt completely private whenever we stayed. Perhaps my favorite thing is how from all the windows you can see beautiful trees and the Oregon outdoors. Even though it was too cold and rainy to use the porch I love the porch and how it adds a layer of privacy and views to hanging out in the living room. I love looking out the door in the living room and hearing and watching the rain. Lisa keeps everything in top notch shape and you will have everything you need. Comfy beds, nice tub, good temp control, excellent kitchen, great washer dryer, and a gorgeous oak tree on the front deck. Nicely walkable to U of O--I forgot, I love how easy it is to get around on foot from here! A winner!"

Each room had good outlets, lighting, window coverings, fans, luggage racks, etc. Kitchen well stocked for cooking, which we did, including an operable and clean BBQ - loved cooking steaks on it! Bathroom clean, well stocked. Overall home well designed, comfortable - all seating was great and not just hanging on before they should be replaced. TV and AC easy to use. Wonderful!"

She communicated very detailed instructions and gave area recommendations which I always appreciate. One thing I like to note since this isn’t always the case at airbnbs is that the beds were super comfortable (and the rooms had blackout curtains) so I slept great! Would definitely recommend this place!

It is right in the middle of all the goings-on at the U of Oregon, if that's your thing...it was a pleasure staying there and wandering around town (lots of ""alleys""!) I do also recommend the Raptor Center a little outside of town...fantastic! and definitely recommend the Studio Cafe just down the road for breakfast! Other recommended restaurants were excellent! Thank you Lisa!!"

Stayed about a week","This is my favorite AirbNb I've stayed in while traveling back and forth from San Diego to Eugene the last few years. It is a lovely place that is thoughtfully organized and beautifully maintained. Lisa was a great communicator who even offered to let us check in early when the place was clean before the 4 PM check in time. Arrival was smooth and the keypad system worked easily. I was so happy when I saw the place for the first time--it is so beautiful. I love how it is situated, with complete privacy by the alley and very quiet, with beautiful trees and greenery out every window. The porch is stunning and nicely decorated. I loved sitting in the living room on the couch and writing while I watched the birds and the rain out the windows. There is also a nice little door in there you can open to let in fresh air. The kitchen is one of the best AirBnB kitchens ever in terms of being well-stocked and well-organized with great appliances and everything was super clean. We slept really well on the excellent bed and also enjoyed taking baths in the perfectly clean tub. Really, it was a dreamy stay in a beautiful place and is good for creative people who want to work on projects as well as people who want to go to sports events nearby. I loved walking to campus every day for the work I was doing at U of Oregon. A really nice walk that I look forward to taking again, when I hopefully come back in March. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Eugene if this is available! Thank you Lisa!"

Stayed a few nights","It was me and my friend’s first time in Oregon and we wanted to stay somewhere walkable, peaceful, and pretty. This listing was the perfect size and location we were envisioning so we happily went with this one. We felt like two fairies in a cute cottage garden! Tucked cozily away in her backyard, we had enough privacy and we had all the amenities we needed. The bed was sooooo comfy! I usually have trouble sleeping when I’m not in my own bed and/or some place different, but I had no problem falling asleep which was greatly noted by me.
Rebecca was responsive and answered any questions we had. My friend and I liked how she was the right amount of attentive. I would love to stay here again the next time I visit Eugene!"

It was also nice that the cottage was right next to a fence door that led into an alley, which meant that we didn't have to walk through the hosts' yard to come and go. The space itself was exactly what we wanted. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage is cute and cozy with all basic amenities a traveler on a short stay needs. Both front and back yards are bursting with beautiful flowers and vegetables. Because our stay was for the Oregon Country Fair, an event that Rebecca, the host, is involved in, and where she stayed the entire time, we didn’t have the pleasure of meeting her, but her husband, Peter, and their adorable dogs, Dobby and Fang were there to greet us and get us situated. There is a sign on the door cautioning one to “watch your step”, but I was so preoccupied looking into the room I stumbled off the step that takes you downward into the room, so do watch that step. The location was extremely convenient for us as it was within walking distance of several excellent eateries, markets, and a Starbucks, but we highly recommend Studio One Cafe for breakfast two short blocks away. This is a very nice place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was exactly what I was looking for my trip down memory lane. It was close enough to UO campus and some great restaurants that I walked nearly the entire time I was there. The property is also well-maintained with lots of garden plants. There was a large tree and a grape pergola next to the cottage that shielded it from the sun, so it always felt comfortable in there, even when the outside temperature was warm. The cottage seemed well insulated too with great windows. I didn't feel chilly in the mornings at all, even when I slept with the windows open. The concrete flooring also helped moderate the inside temperature. The place is very private, so I was able to relax and unwind more readily.
Rebecca was also very communicative and gave me all the information I needed for self-checkin. There is also a designated parking spot for guests. Her dogs are wonderful and friendly. I'd stay here again!"

The Cozy Cottage lived up to its name from the pre-heated radiant-heat floors to all we could need to prepare our own meals in-house, including coffee, tea, and cooking spices. The linens were plentiful and high quality; the bright interior and furnishings, welcoming and bright. With all the thoughtful touches throughout, it was even better than home away from home. Rebecca is an excellent communicator, gave us great tips for the area including a thoughtful binder and local magazines. A wide variety of eateries within walking distance. A lovely, safe neighborhood. Uber service within 2-3 minutes with every use (we used them a lot). Highly recommend. We'll be back."
