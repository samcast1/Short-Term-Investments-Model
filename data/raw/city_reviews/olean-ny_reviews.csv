Stayed about a week","The place was beautiful! Aaron and Christine have done a great job in decorating and remodeling an older house. It was perfect for us to stay close to town and visit our old home town and friends.
The house was also comfortable and quiet.
We would definitely recommend this place to others who may need a more personal environment to stay in the Allegany , NY area."

Stayed a few nights","If I could give 10 stars I would! This is a top tier Airbnb.
Aaron is very responsive, helpful and has thought of everything to make it a perfect Airbnb. The interior of the house is even better than the photos- friends stopped by to pick us up and were wowed by how impressive it was. The large backyard with beautifully landscaped firepit area is so nice. The location is close to Olean and Ellicotville but you're in a very quiet, family neighborhood.
The entire house has been updated in stylish, modern decor and Aaron has lovely antiques and artwork around that makes it feel like home. Each bedroom has a smart TV and the beds were very comfy and the kitchen was stocked with anything you could think of.
We will absolutely stay here on our next visit. Thanks so much for hosting us!"

Stayed a few nights","Aaron's home is on a quiet street in the small town of Allegany. It was neat and clean upon arrival. My partner and I were very pleased with Aaron's communication. He contacted us in advance with pertinent information and answered our questions promptly. My partner and I were on a romantic getaway. We would have liked candles and a vase for flowers in the home but found neither. However, those were minor inconveniences. We improvised and made due. We had fun hiking in nearby Allegany State Park, and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring across the border in PA and throughout some of the southerntier itself."

Our hosts also made a little care package when they found out we had a birthday, which was lovely. The one thing that bothered me a bit was the lack of curtains on the kitchen windows for privacy, but I’m used to city living & there wasn’t really anyone around anyway! A great spot & we would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Fantastic spot conveniently located on a quiet street. The house was well appointed and cozy. And it had everything we needed plus a few things we didn't expect (like Kodiak Kakes pancake mix and the Tim Hortons KCups). As a family of Van Gogh fans, we all enjoyed the Van Gogh prints hanging in the kitchen and small bedroom.
Aaron & Christine are wonderful hosts. When the WiFi unexpectedly went out, they kept us in the loop and made sure everything worked for us when it came back on.
My only suggestion would be to add blinds in the kitchen for more privacy. Loved this place and hope to stay again next time we're in the area."

Stayed a few nights","I come to Olean often because my family lives here. Josh has multiple Airbnb units including this one and I’ve rented them multiple times. This is a second floor unit. This unit is clean, private and quiet. I’ve read the other reviews and yes, the heater does make ticking sounds from the expansion and contraction but it didn’t bother me at all. My only criticism was the bed. It was a bit uncomfortable. But nothing is quite like home I guess. For the cost per night, this is a great Airbnb. I will definitely stay here again."

We liked the layout, it was nice that the tv could be adjusted to watch on the couch or on the bed, I have to have the tv on to sleep. The space was just what we needed for a short weekend trip, clean, comfy linens, good size bathroom, plenty of kitchen supplies. Loved that there were lots of outlets everywhere! Josh was very responsive when I had questions. We would definitely stay here again, the location was perfect for access to Portville and Wellsville. Thank you Josh!"

The building/unit was actually located on the other side of the street. The unit was just as described. It’s a larger studio which was plenty for me. It had all the necessary amenities including a Keurig and k-cups which I appreciate! My only criticism is that the bed/bedding/pillows could be improved. But would I stay here again? Absolutely. For the price, it’s a great deal."

The heater which was two feet away from the bed was so loud we were kept up all night after driving hours to reach the location. Every time it started up it sounded like a dryer full of marbles, which woke us up every 45 minutes. I messaged the host over 30 hours ago to let them know I was leaving early and I still haven’t received a response… left after 7 hours in the place and was refunded 35$. Vacation ruined"

Stayed a few nights","Great studio space. Enough space that it isn't cramped and has everything you need. Was difficult to find as the map directs to you to the left side of the street and the house is on the right and set back from the road. I'm sure much easier to find in daylight than at night when we arrived.
Space has everything you need, though does smell like someone used to smoke in the space. It's certainly been a while and not fresh, just that dull, stale smell of a previous smoker, or maybe someone smokes in the building. But the space itself is clean and definitely met our needs.
You are in a neighborhood setting so don't expect it to be walkable to much."

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay at Henley Hideaway. This spot was very cozy and welcoming. There were two very nice bedrooms and a full kitchen that made it easy to cook. Pets are allowed which was great for our pups to be able to join us and the back yard is fenced in so we could let our dogs outside without a leash. Our only complaint would be that we wish the grass in the back yard had been mowed prior to our stay as the grass was pretty tall and the weather was cloudy with on and off showers, so our small dogs got fairly wet when they would go out. Overall, it was a great place to stay for a reasonable fee."

Loved the amenities, decor, and well stocked kitchen, iron, extra pillows, blankets. Loved the AC as we came in a heat wave summer moment and the guest book was great to see recommendations from other guests.
Ate at Home Plate a few times which was a quick walk downstairs.
Josh was responsive to a bed issue and fixed it in a timely manner.
We brought our little one so would suggest a pack and play option as you definitely have storage room for one :-). We flew so it was hard to bring all the things we may need.
Thanks again and we will definitely be back."

Only complaint is not on the place itself but the fact that it is on the Main Street of town and lots of obnoxious motorists could be very easily heard waking us throughout the night. Overall a great deal for the price.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed two nights at this location and found it worked reasonably well for us. The stairs proved to be a bit more than what worked well for one of us. It is well appointed, very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere and very clean. The four star rating came from the stairs and the difficulty reading the Airbnb parking signs. We spoke with Josh and he had ordered replacement signs, but they had not yet arrived. Designated off-street parking is always a boon. We would consider one of his other places if there's no stairs."

Stayed a few nights",It is located next to a weed dispensary where you will smell weed. I was attacked by dogs from next door in the parking lot. Not in a safe environment and location. Blinds were all broken up inside for 3 windows. It looks good online but looks are deceiving. Once you arrive it was a terrible place. Have to climb maybe 15 steps to get to location airbnb. Host Josh could care less. Tried to reach out to him he totally ignored me and never responded. I ended up not staying there and checked in to a hotel instead. I requested a refund he did not respond. So contacted management of airbnb and received my money back.

Stayed over a week","Josh had a very nice updated Airbnb with nice amenities. Great local shops in the surrounding area. The couple downsides that I experienced: the place can get noisy because it’s living room windows are located right on the main road plus your above a business that sometimes you can hear conversations and when I had to change my checkout date due to work cancelation I messaged him 10 days prior to me leaving and I did not get any acknowledgment from the host. Also, I messaged him when I check-out and still no acknowledgment.
But again for the location and price compared to other Airbnbs and hotels in the area its a good deal."

Once the sun went down the air conditioner really helped to cool down the apartment. A bit lacking in cookware, so no scrambled eggs for breakfast, but I was able to get around that. The entrance to the 2nd floor faces the main street, but is well lit. Would definitely stay again. Thanks!"

We were in town for an event and are so happy to have found this peaceful gem.
Falen was so kind to us, showing us where to walk on her beautiful property—-so worth the uphill hike to take in the stunning views!
The space was perfect: so clean and with great amenities.
Highly recommend!"

The owner made the best of a compact space, providing the basic necessities (coffee bar, microwave, hot plate, fridge) for you. Loved the games and the adorable outside lights, making it very inviting. The ""only"" reason for not giving it 5 stars across the board was because the bed was a bit too small and soft for our liking (my husband and I have a king at home!) Falen is the sweetest and a very accommodating host."

Bigger curtains on the one window. When the light sensor went off during the night it lit the whole room up. Otherwise great stay and very comfortable for what I was doing. I read the review about the cold temps so I came prepared. Overall good place to stay during warmer temps.

It is pretty cold, despite using the fireplace on full blast honestly, but not so cold you cannot sleep. sadly there was not a second set of blankets for me (my friend got the bed, I was on the couch which is a pullout bed). So ask for more bedding if you need it! There is a hot plate, but no actual stove. So beware of that!"

After a day of work in the cold it really sucked to be freezing while the place heated up. Supposed to sleep 4 people but aside from the bed comforter there was only one small and thin blanket availabe for couch bed. Would be impossible to sleep 4 as advertised.

Stayed a few nights","If you are someone who expects a hotel+ experience, this is not it. I’m not that person, and I found Falen’s converted man cave to be perfectly comfy. It’s not refined — DIY finishes, some missing pieces, and a bit of off-roading to get to a convenient parking spot. But I found the listing to be accurate and honest, the check-in process to be very smooth, and the overall value of the place to be great. I would not want to do a long stay here, for fear of missing out on some comforts. However, I think this is a great listing for someone who doesn’t have a big budget but doesn’t feel comfortable sharing a room in a house."

The cottage was newly renovated and was very very clean. The location is perfect for a visit to Olean or Portville. We did have a shower issue - water dribbled out and didnt get hot but once Falen was alerted she had someone come right out and replace the shower head. Everything we needed was provided including coffee options, hair dryer and toiletries. The cottage is behind a main house and you have to walk through the backyard to enter. Recommend bringing a flashlight if you arrive back in the evening."

We ate at so many wonderful restaurants such as Rafi’s Kitchen, Union Whiskey, Mangi’s Pizza, Bradford Airport Restaurant. All of that being said, there’s so much to do in the area within an hour or two. We weren’t at the Airbnb too much, but it was a nice place to cozy up, relax, and sleep. We slept in the loft after night one because the main bedroom mattress was so hard. Ladies, BYO blow dryer if you have thicker or longer hair. Overall, I recommend this place, especially for the price."

Stayed a few nights","We've stayed at many Airbnb's from VA to VT and found Keith's place to be one of our favorites. This is a single home, at the end of a small lane with a porch that wraps around 1/2 the house. The comfortable couches, open floor plan, privacy and natural sunlight pouring through the large windows makes the first floor a great place to hang out. The bedrooms are on the 2nd floor with a large master and separate loft room. It's also a very quiet Airbnb. Though we didn't use much in the kitchen due to eating out, it was well stocked with everything you'd need. My husband and I grew up in the area and we are excited to have found an excellent Airbnb, close to Portville, for future visits."

They had pots, pans, cutting boards, silverware, coffee filters, condiments, salt, really nice plates, mugs, glasses. They have a nice Samsung dishwasher, an electric stove. A washer/dryer. They had blankets & towels. 2 Queen sized beds, a bedroom, a loft. 2 bathrooms!!! A beautiful wrap around deck with a nice backyard with a cool fire-pit! Walking distance from their Convenience store and around stores in Olean. We came to visit family who live in Shinglehouse, PA. We absolutely loved the place and plan to book here again next year when we make our annual trip 'home.' oh there is also AC and a nice electric fireplace/heater. Wifi worked great!"

But we were pleasantly surprised by Rock City Park which is only a short 12-minute drive away from the house - very pretty and great for a short hike around. If weather permits, the back yard is great for star-gazing at night as well.
Plenty of cookware in the kitchen, soaps/hand sanitizer in the bathroom. Aldi and walmart is also a short drive away - can get groceries and toiletries if you forgot to bring any."

The house has a great open feel and good vibe and we felt like we had plenty of room to move around for privacy and quiet--my husband and I sometimes had Zoom calls for business while kids were watching TV--and plenty of (multiple) sofa space to sprawl out on at night. We took a surprise trip to Niagara Falls, NY (less than 2 hours), explored Rock City Park, visited Kinzua Bridge, trekked in Allegheny National Forest, and the fire pit in the back yard was great for s'mores. But if you want Dunkin Donuts, you do have to drive about 10 miles out of town :) Highly recommend Keith's place for location, location, location!"

Stayed a few nights",This place was amazing! It is just outside of town so it's nice and quiet but close enough to run into town. It's nice and cozy and brings a comfort of home. Everything i clean and nothing is out of place. Would highly recommend and be a repeat customer. Any questions I had he answered in a timely manner.

Stayed a few nights","I really loved this place - it was cozy and perfect for what we needed. We were in town for a funeral, so we wanted to stay someplace that felt like a home rather than a hotel. The host was kind, very communicative and even had drinks/snacks in the fridge, which made us feel welcome. The location was easy to find on a main road not too far from the rest of the town. I wish we had been more prepared for the long, steep stairs leading up to the unit. If you or a loved one requires a wheelchair or has issues with stairs, this won't be the place for you. I also wish we were able to visit the antique shop underneath it during our stay, which should not be held against the host. Just know that it is only open 11a-4p Thursday, Friday and Saturday, so you have a short window to check the antique store out. Overall a very lovely place in Olean!"

It was just me this trip, so the single-serve coffee maker came in very handy. And I had my folding bike with me, it was easy to start the morning with a loop around the nearby trail, with its leafy river views.
A couple of weeks before my trip, I decided to extend my stay an extra day. Zachary was very accommodating, and I appreciated that!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the third time we have stayed in the upstairs unit of Zachary's home in Olean, and it is always the perfect experience. Easy check in, the description of the unit is spot on, the bathroom has been recently updated and is much more functional than our last stay which made the stay even more enjoyable. We always love finding the cold bottled water, coffee and breakfast bars in the kitchen when we arrive. This unit is perfect for 2-3 guests, a comfortable living area, the AC window unit kept the space as cool as we needed it, and the kitchen was nicely stocked with some essentials for making quick meals in rather than dining out for every meal. I'm born and raised in the area but have since moved out of state, so it is nice to have somewhere nearby to all the places I miss when I come to visit, like Beef N Barrel, Napoli Pizza, Four Mile Brewery, a short drive to my hometown of Wellsville to get some Texas Hot, Spragues in Portville, and close to the grocery stores as well. We already have our next stay at Zachary's booked to visit again in a few months. Thank you Zachary for maintaining such a nice, quaint, comfortable unit for your guests. We look forward to our next stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed on the second floor. It was impeccably clean and decorated beautifully. It had all the amenities of a small apartment! The beds were comfortable and the shower had great water pressure! Just be sure you are able to carry your luggage up 16 steps if you are booking the second floor. The small window air conditioner was enough to cool off the entire apartment. There was a little restaurant nearby where we had breakfast called the Home Plate that was good and inexpensive. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We really loved everything about our rental. They had the old farmhouse decor which was very homey and comfortable. Beds and furniture were all in new condition and felt fresh and clean. It really did feel like a home away from home. Zachary left a welcome notebook that was helpful and informative. Thoughtful 'extras' like a kuerig and coffee pods, bottled water in the refrigerator, breakfast bars and many little things that you would find nice to have available in a kitchen setting. The bathroom had shampoo and conditioner and soap, and other items that you might have forgotten to pack, available for use.
The ONLY complaint, was that our key code to get in wasn't set correctly and we couldn't get in when we first arrived. (My bad that I did not have the airbnb app on my phone to get a message to Zachary) Thankfully, the housekeeper 'happened by' soon after and helped us get in and fixed our code. Praise God!
We recommend this place,... and now that we have in-laws in that area, we will use Zachery's place again if it's available when we need it."

Also, the shower head is very low, but that’s not necessarily an issue for all! Just as a tall person, it made showering a little bit difficult.

A very small bathroom that fit one person at a time.a shower that was hard to get in. I would recommend his airbnb because of him also, Because the hotels around are more expensive and same size. Except the bathroom. The chairs are very comfortable. Which you do not get in a hotel. Thank Tom for a very nice stay."

First, the parking spot right next to the door was a pleasant surprise. No lugging suitcases across a big yard or up flights of stairs! And inside it was very clean and had a calming atmosphere. I loved the view out the back of the fields...it felt so peaceful, private, and like a rural setting. And yet, there are stores and restaurants just a 2 minute drive away, if you need anything! Tom and Kathy were very flexible when I asked about the check-in and check-out times. I really appreciated that. And also, at one point, I reached out to Tom about something and he immediately responded and went above and beyond to get me what I needed. He also recommended to me some local trails nearby, which was nice! If you're looking for a place to stay in Olean, look no further. I will definitely be back!!!"

Stayed one night","My girlfriend and I booked a last minute trip to snowboard at Holiday Valley resort. Finding a nice place in that area for a good price is extremely difficult, and we were lucky enough to find this Airbnb as the first listing that popped up. The price is more affordable than anything in the area and our experience with our first Airbnb was flawless. Would definitely return here in the future and would absolutely recommend this place to anyone that needs to stay in the area. The hosts made us feel welcome and the unit was spotless."

I wish I could have stayed longer as the reviews on the site AND the in-suite reviews (they have a spiral notebook full of positivity about the place) reveal a 5-star experience. Last, but certainly not least, is the great VALUE of this suite; the decor, comfort, and responsive communication make it one of the best."

Stayed one night","This place is ridiculous! First off it’s absolutely charming and precious with An amazingly cute little area. Very quiet and private. Second, it just felt so… inviting… it’s cozy and comfortable as soon as you walk in. Everything was neat and felt like a lot of care was placed into setting it up and making it feel that way. Finally the hosts are genuinely caring, sweet and very responsive. If I had any issues - which who could - I’m positive just from our interactions that they would have done anything in their power to rectify it. I can’t say enough about how great a place this is… most comfortable bed I’ve slept in, in what seems like forever. Would come back and bring a loved one just so I could play games with them while enjoying this cozy gem."

Their home was located in a quiet, lovely neighborhood and we enjoyed seeing the deer and rabbits that showed up every now and then. It was certainly a welcome retreat at the end of each day! We had an opportunity to meet and chat with Tom a little at the end of our stay! He was so friendly and kind. Thank you so much Tom and Kathy for providing such a warm and inviting place to stay!

Stayed a few nights","Tom and Kathy's charming, quiet space was just what I needed to relax before and after 3 very long and busy days of business! It was pretty easy to find, because the town they're in uses identical red and black sines to mark each house number. You can drive right up to the private entrance.
I was pretty tired when I drove in. Since you gain entrance by using a code that's part of your phone #, even if you're pooped, you can remember it and get in.
It's a well laid out studio apartment - warm and inviting with a sitting/ watching TV area, a kitchen area, a sleeping area, even a desk. The easy chairs and bed were cushy and comfortable. There's lots of light from the windows in the daytime. A very quiet ceiling fan which I used. A room air conditioner, which I didnot.Everything was quite clean!
The views of the yard are green and calming in early June. Early one morning I watched two groundhogs ""mowing the grass"" out of a window!
I would love to stay again on my next trip to the area"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing stay! It had everything I could’ve wanted to help prepare for my interview at the school—a desk, iron and ironing board, everything we needed for food from silverware and plates to even paper towels which I did not expect. Awesome!
My husband who has always been hesitant about air bnbs also commented on how well put together, clean and comfortable the place is. We loved the seating area, the private entrance, and all the conveniences. We even enjoyed a game of mancala. Excellent communicative hosts that did not infringe on our space in anyway. Everything we could want in a stay. Will come back."

Olean is a small town, and everything we needed to get to was within 7 minutes of this location. I would highly recommend staying here, whether it's for one night or many. You will not be disappointed!"
