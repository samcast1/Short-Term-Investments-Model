Stayed a few nights","Overall I would describe my stay as “okay”. The main factors that did not make my stay “great” were the screams of the hosts kids early in the AM (9am both morning of the stay), the chicken sounds also in the AM (as early as 6am), and the bed could be improved (low to the ground and slopes toward the middle).
Everything is as described in the listing and the stay is in a desirable location but would probably look for a different Airbnb on my next visit."

I’d say the listing was accurate, and we had a great time running around OKC. I’m happy we were so close to the Plaza area. It was our favorite by far."

Stayed one night","We didn’t have an issue finding the address or getting to the backyard, but if you had very large or heavy suitcases it could be difficult as there was no paved path and you had to walk around the hosts vehicles in the driveway. The place was cute and nicely decorated. Only tap water available, I wished there was a water filter pitcher in the fridge. There was no ice available. Everything looked and felt clean - however I had troubles falling asleep because the linens smelled so bad. It was like they were using a moldy washing machine. The towels were the same. They looked clean but just had a lingering musty and unpleasant odor. The worst part was the guinea fowl! I knew they had chickens…. But these other birds were SO LOUD and INCESSANT at all hours. Also, kids playing right outside made our adult *alone* time feel…awkward. The screen over the front door of the place was quite sheer and I didn’t feel like we had privacy in that room. The price was very reasonable, though."

Stayed one night","Nice location- quiet and near restaurants. However, the hostess ignored multiple messages about our need for bath towels (never responded even though the messages were read). We were unable to take showers because of this and were in the middle of a road trip. The bed was also uncomfortable and caved in towards the middle. Additionally, the air/heating unit rumbled the room so I would recommend turning it off to sleep."

It was too hot for us to walk around and explore, but we would definitely return to the area at a cooler time of year and do just that. We were traveling home after a long camping trip and had a lot of gear in our car but felt secure leaving it parked on the street. Appreciated that Eva already had the air conditioning on so that the space was cool when we arrived. Appreciated the awesome coffee setup even more."

Everything was neat, clean, and comfortable, and we appreciated thoughtful touches, like good coffee, oatmeal, and toiletries. The bed is a bit low, which didn’t bother us, but I wouldn’t recommend for everyone. There’s also a step up from the kitchenette to the bedroom, which, again, wasn’t an issue for us, but is something others may want to be aware of. Overall, we would definitely recommend and will try to book again next time we’re in OKC!"

Stayed a few nights","I’d have to stay that this was one of the best experiences we’ve ever had with a host, and such a wonderful overall experience with our stay that I cannot recommend Eva’s place more.
She sent a message at the time of booking-weeks in advance, asking if we had questions and I asked for all of her recommendations.
She asked my interests and tailored a guide specifically to me. I made a brief mention about liking Matcha tea, and that was that.
Fast forward, we arrive with a breeze of a check in, took a look around and everything fit the space so well. You can tell Eva has attention to detail and despite the space being small, it was exactly what we needed.
She had a coffee corner where something caught my eye, a matcha setup to make my own, that I had forgotten I had told her about weeks prior. Turns out she got me everything to make it because she dug deeper and found out the place she mentioned stopped serving matcha and she didn’t want me to miss out.
The cherry on top of our trip"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy is the perfect description! Eva's place is a cute, stand-alone cottage in the back of their driveway. Clean with very comfortable bed, it is perfect for 1 or 2 people to stay when in Oklahoma City. It's extremely close to the Plaza strip via 3-5 minute walk. Great local restaurants and bars. Perfect free on-street parking and easy driving or Uber/Lyft access to other parts of the city for exploring. Cottage included anything you may need for your stay as it relates to toiletries (bonus for including some items that other places don't provide!) and in-kitchen essentials. Was pleasantly surprised to have option to create own french press coffee in the morning. Recommend for your next stay in OKC :)"

Stayed one night","I wouldn't go out of my way to find it again. It is suitable for one or maybe two ppl for a few nights.
Bed is comfy.
Neighborhood seemed safe. There was a sheriff's SUV parked across the street overnight, guess he lives nearby.
The unit does not feel private or quiet. You are obviously staying in someone's mother-in-law cottage just a few feet away.
Shower is *tiny*.
One small car will park in the middle of the driveway and make it weird to walk back and forth.
Milk in the fridge was unopened but weeks expired, glad I didn't drink it 🤢"

It offers a bit more than a standard hotel room and gives you an idea of what it’s like to live like a local, tucked into a quaint neighborhood away from the bustle of downtown. We did take advantage of the ease of street parking, leaving our car by the cottage and walked a couple of miles to check out local sites, restaurants and breweries. As others have mentioned the shower is a bit tight, but the remaining bedroom and kitchen space makes up for it."

The whole historical homes in the area were beautiful and had so much character. This cottage was the perfect size and close to so much like a short drive to the Paycom Center to watch a Thunder game. Eva gave great recommendations on food, but also highly recommend Cafe Kacao. The bed was comfortable with clean and soft linens. We’d stay here again for sure."

Very safe neighborhood of unique houses: family residences. A very funky 3-block district of shops and restaurants and brew pubs is a 10 min walk away. The street is well away from noisy interstates and streets, and the little house itself is tucked back off-street: private, a good night's sleep assured. Be aware that the kitchen is a bit under-equipped for cooking a meal. Highly recommended."

The animals were closer than we anticipated, and it provided for a very fun amount of entertainment. The place is better than described, and the amenities are perfect for what you’d be looking for. Easiest 5 star I’ve reviewed. Can’t think of a downside unless you don’t like animals. Even so, you don’t have to pet them—so no downside."

Decorations make you want to spend more time here. Well designed accommodations with your comfort in mind. We wish had been able to spend more time enjoying the back porch setting.
We had the privilege of meeting David and his dad. Really friendly gentlemen with the gift of hospitality.
David is quick to respond on communication.
This is sure to be a popular Air BnB guests will want to return to as a favorite."

I do have mild allergies if I get around them too long, or maybe get the right amount of dander or hair on me. She assured me that they do not get into the guest side, so I decided to take the chance. When I arrived, she told me that she put an air purifier in my room, and had shut off the vent connected to the main part of the home so the air could be purified by the time I checked in. I had a great nights sleep, without any sign of allergies. I really appreciated the honesty and concern to make sure I had a great and safe stay. I would recommend her place anytime."

We ended up there unexpectedly and couldn't have been happier with the results of the experience. We recommend staying in any of their places ESPECIALLY good spot for travel nurses it would seem. Overall ZERO complaints, we will ALWAYS check for availability with them for all out Oklahoma trips whether personal or on business."

Stayed over a week","Well, I stayed at Emi place during the pandemic of COVID-19. I was supposed to have a medical school rotation at Oklahoma but everything got cancelled due to the COVID-19 and I got stuck there. Emi didn’t let me feel I am away from home. She always was making sure I am safe and don’t need anything. She and all her family were very nice. She is a great host and mom! During that hard time with everything closed, cancelled rotations, staying at home just studying, the low mood and anxiety surrounding the circumstances and add to this being away from home, I felt like there is someone didn’t want me to feel away from home or to miss family. Thanks a lot, Emi!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a really nice choice for our trip to OKC. It's a new build, and new style of home that you may not have seen before. Small living space, but well-organized and offering enough room so my wife and I could work independently when necessary. Stairs are tight and steep - they'll be tricky for children and/or those with knee trouble. Neighborhood is terrific - residents out walking dogs and waving at each other. Onsite eating at Taco Nation (good) and a Fall Farmer's Market in the center of town. Very charming.
The loft at the top of the stairs was an oasis - including a futon, electric standing/sitting desk and plenty of natural daylight. The living room allowed for some pre-bed television, and they had a new memory foam mattress - meaning we both slept well (no divots or bouncy springs). My wife was pleased that the kitchen offered all the amenities we needed, and the host left some beverages in the fridge as a courtesy. I was glad for quiet neighbors and fast internet."

Eric and Blake’s place in the Plaza District is a clear standout from all the rest. I returned here every chance I could because they have created such a comfortable, lovely space in a great neighborhood. There are so many wonderful touches-plentiful, high quality towels, choices of delicious coffee, the perfect selection of dishes and wine glasses, thoughtful snacks-so many of the things that help a person relax when traveling. The design is extremely well done and the art choices are spot on. Eric and Blake could not be better hosts-so very kind and generous and welcoming. I am so grateful to have found this gem!"

The bed was super comfortable, the TV was huge and had plenty of streaming services, the WiFi was fast, the fresh flowers were lovely, and the washer and dryer in unit was a godsend. The artwork was gorgeous and fun, the instructions were excellent, the hosts were extremely responsive and friendly, and the most fun neighborhood in the city is a few blocks away (The Plaza). Even the occasional neighborhood church bells (daytime) reminded me of my grandparents’ grandfather clock and made me smile. The cold water and breakfast items were very thoughtful and the dogs were adorable and greeted me on occasion. Such a great place! I will be back! Trust me, THIS is where you want to stay!
Oh, and you MUST try the pie and quiche at The Pie Junkie in The Plaza! Call ahead or go online to order and they will have it ready. Great take out!"

Stayed a few nights","Eric and Blake have created a lovely Airbnb space on their property. The design choices are so well done and there are thoughtful touches at every turn. The space feels homey and comfortable and the neighborhood is great for walking. I have stayed at many Airbnbs and although several have had wonderful hosts, Eric and Blake are simply head and shoulders above the rest. They are kind and immediately available if anything is needed but very respectful of privacy. There are no chores to do at time of checkout and they make everything easy. I couldn’t recommend this Airbnb more highly!"

We felt completely at home the whole time and we're genuinely excited to head back and get cozy in bed after a day full of activities. Their local recommendations were also very much on point and we enjoyed every restaurant we had the chance to try! Would highly recommend and will most definitely be staying here again next time we're in town.

Only tiny negatives (although clearly stated in their listing) is there is no bathroom door, if that's an issue, and their ceiling fan is a little noisy if it's hot out, you like to have the fan on at night, and you're a light sleeper. Otherwise, this is one of the better Air BnB's we've rented, and is perfect for a couple visiting OKC and wanting to be close to everything in the central part of the city."

The space is quiet, spacious yet cozy, walkable yet private, close to it all while also feeling like you’re in your own little escape. Eric and Blake were quick to communicate while also being proactive and providing the information I needed for a smooth check in and check our process. The attention to detail with snack and flowers truly does make it all the more cozy. Admittedly, this is probably one of my favorite airbnb’s that I’ve stayed in because of how comfortable, clean and quiet it was. 11/10 would recommend."

The location was great because it was only a 10 minuet drive or less from everywhere around the city that we needed to go for our friends wedding. Fair warning to any light sleepers who are staying for the weekend, there is a church across the street and on Sunday they rang the bells bright and early. We didn’t mind since we were already up to catch a flight, but it might be something to be aware of if you like to spend your Sundays sleeping in. Other than that, 10/10 would highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't recommend Eric and Blake's place enough! It's definitely a great place for being on your own or a couple. It's mentioned in the description but just a heads up that this is a guest house and there isn't a door for the bathroom. If that isn't an issue for you, it's so comfortable and cozy!
Everything in the place is so updated and really thoughtfully put together. You'll never want to stay in a hotel again! The bed is so comfortable (a big plus for me!) and there is a large TV in the bedroom with access to Netflix, Hulu, etc. The shower is great as well. Even though the space is small, the kitchen is set up nicely. It's not a full kitchen, but they have a hot plate, toaster, microwave, and fridge if you have leftovers or want to cook something easy. They also have a dishwasher and plenty of dishes.
They also left granola bars and oatmeal and various snacks. Which was super thoughtful and sweet. Plus as you can see in the pictures, the entire place is decorated with local artwork. Really loved my stay here!"

Only (very minor) possible issue: the owners’ home is next to the guest house, and they have 3 dogs. We love dogs, so not an issue for us, but be aware that the dogs probably will be out a couple times each day around the guest house, and they will bark in the early morning (6 or 7 am), if you’re a light sleeper (or don’t like dogs)."

It was nice to see decaf with the coffee pods. That was a first. She always had cups of oatmeal for breakfast. Stephanie is is very fast at her replies. We were taking our time site seeing RT 66 so we got in around 9:30, but I messaged her an told her we were there. Next time we go through there, we are going to stay longer. It was the first time during our 2 week trip that I actually slept all night. I wish I could give more than 5 ⭐️"

Stayed with kids","We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay at in OKC! This guest house is small, but super nice and just all around perfect for a couple or small family like ours(1 child). We loved how clean and welcoming the place felt as soon as we stepped up into the unit. Not only is the guest house super nice, but the Wheeler District, in which it lies, is really beautiful also. The best part though is its location! It's super close to all and any downtown activities, restaurants, or sights you may want to visit. Most stuff in downtown, including bricktown, is about a 10-15min drive up the road. Super convenient in every way.
We truly did enjoy our stay, even though it was just for two nights. Stephanie and Chris are amazing hosts. Great communication and they make you feel welcome and right at home. Don't pass this AirBnB up. Highly Recommend a stay here!"

It’s located in a peaceful, enchanting neighborhood with a brewery, coffee shop, taco restaurant, and several parks within walking distance. The space itself is beautifully decorated, clean, and comfortable. They have added very thoughtful touches, such as a fully stocked coffee/tea drawer, a locals guidebook to Oklahoma City, and a cute, easy to identify entrance marker. Felt like a home away from home! The host is very accommodating, communicates well, and is super responsive.
Stephanie and her husband created such a fantastic space. I can’t wait to visit again. Thank you so much !!"

If you stay in Wheeler you must check out the businesses nearby. More coming each week, The Big Friendly is a great brewery. A huge bonus of staying at the property is the proximity of the businesses.
Stephanie was very quick with communication and answering my questions through the app! Super friendly, she could not have been a better host. Everything was easy to use, they've got one of the better welcome books I've seen. Scissortail is a great spot, I'm definitely coming back!"

We certainly appreciate the gesture of breakfast offering or 15% off of our next stay!
We most likely will not stay again for $230/night for the amount of issues in cleanliness and disrepair that took down the value of the advertisement.
We were also on alert with DB monitors in the home, the overall comfort level of the home, dirty walls and baseboards, loose flooring, broken bed frame, and the very strong odor of Marijuana for the majority of our stay."

We had a great time and if we visit OKC again, will definitely want to book the same place.

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful condo in the minimalist style. It's location is great: within walking or trolley distance to dining and more, including the OK City Convention Center. The unit was fragrance chemical scent free and there were no musty, dusty carpets. The heating and cooling worked well and access to the unit was simple.
There were some cons for us tho: the furniture in the living area was fantastically uncomfortable which made it difficult to enjoy tv watching and meeting sessions, additionally, the living area contains an entire wall made of glass without shades or curtains so there is no privacy in that room. There were no shelves or racks in the shower to place your home-brought shampoos and soaps and the door to the bathroom with the shower in it did not close all the way. Also lacking in the condo in general was the option to dim lights or have low light level choices.
We hope these things might change because we'd love to count on this condo as our go-to stay in OKC!"

We knew we had a long drive from Santa Fe to Oklahoma City, and that we would arrive late and tired. We needed a comfortable place with laundry near the downtown area, and this was perfect. Cody was extremely responsive to a couple of questions. After a good night's sleep, I enjoyed coffee and pastry from a nearby shop while taking in the views from the living area. The photographs accurately reflect the stylist interior. Although I didn't walk much during this stay, I know the area well, and this is a great location walking distance from the downtown area and several restaurants."

Stayed with a pet","Exactly as advertised - in an awesome location in Midtown, easy walking distance to several restaurants and bars, and very unique with the large windows and excellent view of downtown. We traveled with our newborn and dog and had a great time. The neighboring space for pets was very useful and there was always ample parking on the street in front of the unit. The stairs between levels provided a good workout, so keep that in mind if any of your guests would struggle with that. We didn’t find the city noise to be an issue, but you will hear sirens coming and going from a local hospital. The hosts were very responsive and helpful! I would highly recommend for smaller parties who want to enjoy the nightlife in the area."

Group trip","Six of us had a wonderful weekend getaway to celebrate our friend’s upcoming wedding. We ate/drank, hung out at the pool and hot tub, played pool and cards. And most of all enjoyed the great conversations within a backdrop of an absolutely gorgeous home inside and out. There were so many rooms; it took awhile to remember the way away around the home. We felt very special."

Group trip","This place was amazing... truly living up to its name, ""The Dream!"" The beautiful hacienda style home is perched on a gorgeous and manicured hillside, among tall trees and flowing fountains. The property is secluded and private, yet close to anything you need in town.
We rented the main house, both casitas, and the separate guest house for a family gathering, and loved having the whole property to enjoy. The exterior is green and lush, with beautiful landscaping and potted plants everywhere. The interior feels like a museum of carefully curated one-of-a-kind antiques, art pieces, and Mexican pottery. You could spend hours admiring the fabulous architecture of this historic home, along with the thoughtfully chosen updates and unique decor throughout.
Other amenities like Nespresso machines placed in each of the bedroom areas and fresh robes hanging in the closets make you feel like you are truly pampered. The owners were very kind and easy to reach for anything."

There’s a small diner and restaurant right across the way we walked to. The parking garage added a level of security/safety, but it takes a little practice pulling into the designated spot since it’s immediately against the wall when you drive into the garage. Check-in and checkout were very easy. We arrived late at night and had no issues getting in. Checkout was very quick and smooth. We’ll definitely consider renting here again with our next visit to OKC."

Our only negatives would be that the shower though very nice is not very practical with the open glass shower. Water would get on the floor and we were not able to enjoy the rain shower. And the bed frame needs improvement as it is not attached to the headboard and would slide and require constant adjustments. Besides that we enjoyed our stay!

Stayed over a week","This studio is compact and efficient with some stylish features in the interior. Bed is fine, but my spouse thought it higher at the foot than the head. The kitchen is compact but reasonably stocked and offers a few more spices or other condiments than normal. We had trouble with the AC and a confusing thermostat and wifi but eventually were accommodated in an adjacent unit. Colton was generous in that regard.
While the interiors are nice, the exterior of the complex feels quite dingey and run down, dirty and uninviting. That made coming back after a day out a bit of a dread. The neighborhood is in transition and the nearby streets are a mix of old and new, run down and reinvented."

Proactive messages to see that you were OK or if you needed anything... courteous, responsible, and flexible.
The space was beautiful - from the decorations, to the comfortable bed, to the lighting, to the cute outdoor area... the space felt cozy and homey. There was plenty of everything, getting in/ parking was easy, it's located convenient to the stairs, his rules are straight forward, there are restaurants within walking distance, easy access throughout the city, and the condo was in a great area.

This spot has an upstairs (with a view) and a downstairs!! The bed was incredibly comfy, and I felt safe in the neighborhood. I also loved that this beautiful home has a history. I will be back if I ever travel here again."

Stayed a few nights","A short stay in OKC ended with us not wanting to leave!!! Veronica's place was amazing! A lovely townhouse that combines charm with modern living. We were not expecting the skyline view from the balcony but took advantage of it while relaxing with a glass of wine after a day of exploring.
We loved EVERYTHING about this space and surprisingly enough OKC had lots to do! We enjoyed Factory Obscura, lovely restaurants on the canal along with a sunset boat cruise all in OKC. Five out of Five stars recommend Veronica!!!"
