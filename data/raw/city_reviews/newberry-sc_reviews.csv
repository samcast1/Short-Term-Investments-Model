Stayed with kids",Jane’s apartment was perfectly appointed and very accurately described. The apartment is surprisingly comfortable and spacious inside considering its actual size….my son loved the curved shower! The use of space in the kitchen is well designed and very functional. Jane was extremely responsive to my multiple questions and very pleasant. I would highly recommend both her beautiful apartment and her as a host.

Amenities are great, and several fun restaurants and shops are within a few steps of the place. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",The apartment was as advertised. Very clean with comfortable beds and fluffy towels. The appliances were a little difficult to work. My husband had to read the manual to figure it out. The outside pool area was not as advertised. There are multiple animals roaming the property so it made is difficult to sit outside. If you are not an animal lover this is not the place for you. The host Mariana is friendly and we enjoyed the few times we chatted.

Stayed a few nights","Very special place! Exquisite home, spotlessly clean! We have been visiting & staying in Newberry for almost 2yrs now & from now on we will only book here. We are thrilled that this is available now. The host has created an unbelievable oasis & has paid great attention to every little detail. There is so much to say about how wonderful she is & the home. Our family greatly enjoyed the beautiful pool as well. Towel warmer is a wonderful luxury!Communication was excellent, she immediately responded. The pull out sofa received approval from our 19 yr old college student. The bed is insanely comfy, husband & I immediately fell asleep. I just can’t say enough, but this gem has everything!! The host is super sweet & truly cares. We asked if she possibly had an item we needed while we were enjoying the pool, within minutes she came outside & ran out to get it!! This is a host who goes above & beyond!! That was just one example! Don’t wait to book your reservation!"

Stayed with kids","Highly recommend Marianna’s guest house!We loved staying! Very clean, comfortable and well organized. We loved having a pool to relax in. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals. There were lots of thoughtful touches, like bottles of water in the fridge for our use; pool towels available; toothpaste/toothbrushes available in case you forget them; first aid supplies; extra blankets and sheets and a bottle of wine if you like. Our children were very cozy on the couch sofa at night and loved seeing the chickens out back; as well as the 2 outdoor cats that reside there. It felt like home away from home!
And it’s in walking distance to all of downtown Newberry for restaurants, entertainment and such.
We look forward to staying again when back in town."

We felt right at home and the home was recently renovated with nice upgrades; which made the stay even more pleasurable. The location was located approximately two minutes from Walmart and 15 minutes from our friends family lake house, so our drive was only about 15 minutes from the home. We will rent again when we go visit our friends family. Thank you for an enjoyable stay."

Stayed a few nights","This is by far one of the best Airbnb‘s I’ve experienced. I will not stay anywhere else when I return to Newberry to visit family. The pictures do it no justice. The bathrooms are amazing I could’ve stayed in the shower all day. She was a fantastic host, because I had a few workarounds with my job. She was very gracious and extremely responsive. It’s located right in the middle of everything you could actually walk to get something to eat. I am definitely not a fan of Newberry but this home made it great. Suggested restaurants I would say would be Figaro and The Palm. The next time I come back to visit family, if this spot is not available, I would seriously be heartbroken. She is sure to be a super host real soon."

Stayed a few nights","This home lives up to its name. My father-in-law and his parents are originally from Newberry, so my husband took his Dad, brother, and aunt to visit their kin. We were so happy to find such a beautiful spot in Newberry. He could not stop raving about how beautiful this home is- -not only on the inside, but on the outside. An eye-catcher as soon as you pull up. They loved having their own bedrooms, and sufficient space. Beautiful and updated furnishings! The photos tell no lie. Once they arrived, their Newberry family came over to visit, and they even remarked how they witnessed the transformation of this home, and all the work put into it! My husband loved all the windows and natural light, as well as the back deck. Our host stocked it with everything needed to feel like your own home, and bonus- - it's literally 5 minutes away from all the eateries and Walmart. I wish I could keep it a secret for our next visit, but you must stay here."

The place was clean and very well stocked with dishes, crockpot, microwave, air fryer, etc if you wanted to cook. The pool area and backyard is beautiful and very peaceful. We had a busy weekend of graduation activities so we didn’t have time to enjoy the pool but enjoyed sitting poolside. Mr. Kitty is super cute and friendly! We enjoyed visiting outside with him. Lisa has the best book of food and activity recommendations we have ever seen and we’ve stayed in a lot of air bnbs. The towels were new, absorbent and soft and my husband said “these are nicer than our towels at home”! There were fresh flowers in each room and popcorn and instant oatmeal along with coffee and tea. I can’t think of anything she possibly could have done better! Clin’on: where the t is silent but oh so sweet. ❤️"

We were coming down for a recruiting visit to PC for our daughter and we had plenty of flex time to check out the surroundings. Lisa provided us great check in instructions and things to do while we were in Clinton. The accommodations are exactly as they're described. Living area and bedrooms are very spacious and comforting...beds are very nice. The backyard surroundings with the pool, firepit and lounge chairs are a great feature. The fresh fruit was a great touch! We had time to visit the town of Laurens for a great dinner and went to Greenville for a half-day visit. Clinton is a small town who takes pride in their community and of course the PC Blue Hose! Can't wait to visit Lisa and her place again!"

The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The shower has great water pressure and the bathroom amenities -including a flat iron-were nice. I was visiting my daughter, a student at PC, and loved that Lisa has a washer and dryer where I could help my daughter get laundry done without having to deal with the communal dorm washer. The house is conveniently located so close to PC which is perfect for my trip's purpose. Lisa reached out about our arrival time and made sure to leave a lighted walkway to the suite and inside lights for us since we arrived late night. The carport parking space is also very nice! Lisa is very friendly and loves hosting. She is so easy to communicate with and I look forward to my next stay!"

Lisa was so welcoming from the moment we set foot on the property. She met us at the carport and walked us over to the apartment, showed us how to get in and explained all the amenities inside. Absolutely nothing was lacking.
And the decor! Every room was beautifully themed and welcoming, as was the living area. The whole apartment is so nice and cozy, with plenty of things to keep people of all ages entertained. My 9 month old loved walking along the ottomans and was mesmerized by Lisa’s cat. He enjoyed her beautiful yard as well!
Overall, we felt like family staying at Lisa’s. She was so friendly and prompt with her responses, I would stay here again just because! We definitely recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Clinton area."

So many cosy little extras and treats throughout the stay like chocolates on the towels, phone chargers, etc. Lisa is a wonderful host and was so welcoming. I felt at home immediately.

Stayed one night","We drove in 8 hours from Tampa, FL and stood at Lisa’s airbnb and it was so pleasant! Coffee, dishware, small kitchen appliances like microwave, coffee maker and tea kettle. Board games, tv with access to streaming apps, comfortable beds that make you wish you could lay there forever, extra pillows and blankets. Nice hotel feel touches like chocolates by the extra towels. Travel must haves and accessories that you have access to if you forgot your own at home! Not to mention the peaceful, quiet backyard with a pool, patio table, firepit and BBQ grill at your access. Beautiful mornings with birds chirping and patio chairs to lounge on. Room for your car in the carport. There were just so many little things that made us feel so warm and cozy. Especially the personalized hand-written welcome card we got upon arrival. We would definitely stay here again and you should too if you’re reading this. Thank you, Lisa. You were a great host!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay! Two bedrooms tastefully decorated with lovely soft sheets - not the microfiber ones that do not breathe - nice natural fabric feeling ones. Bedside tables included charging cords with various connection types. Large living room area with comfortable sofas and an instruction booklet with all the needed details and restaurant recommendations. Generously sized desk for working. Dining area with a table that seats four and area for coffee, tea, and treats. We enjoyed the fall colored M&Ms. Outside was also lovely. A little cool for swimming during our but we sat on the edge of the pool and put our feet in one night. There were also fire pit and grilling areas which we did not use.
Lisa made a point of greeting us and checking in via text as needed. She has created a welcoming home away from home for guests. Thank you Lisa!"

Stayed with a pet","College View Cottage was a fantastic home-away-from-home to enjoy a girl's weekend in Clinton! All was exactly as described, and then some! The unit is very clean, spacious, comfortable, welcoming, and well appointed with everything we needed. Lisa even thought of those items one might forget at home, which I really appreciated! As a coffee lover, I was happy that there was a Keurig as well as a traditional coffee pot. A girl likes choices!
Though we tried many the local eateries, it was nice to have the ability to cook/grill a quick meal in, had we chosen to do so. The lovely back yard and swimming pool was a much appreciated added bonus, that we enjoyed for daytime play and nighttime conversation and relaxation. It was so nice to enjoy living space, both indoors and outdoors.
This was my first Airbnb rental experience, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the whole experience. When in the Clinton area, Lisa's College View Cottage is a great place to stay and Lisa couldn't have been a better host!"

(In my case I commented to my husband that her house gave off the same feeling that my grandparents house did growing up!) :) Thanks again Lisa!

Lisa made us croissants in the morning and there were even snacks and toiletries! This is like the good old days of real bed and breakfasts. I’d recommend anyone coming to Clinton stay here.

Stayed with kids","This is my second stay with Lisa. My family and I were in town to attend a local event and based on our past experience, we knew that this would be a convenient and comfortable space for us while we were visiting. Lisa, as always, is quick to respond to questions or requests, and she is ever the cordial host. My 13yo daughter's highlight of the trip is getting a peek at Oreo (Lisa's dog) so she checked that box off for this trip as well. Highly recommended location if you are in the Clinton area or surrounding communities."

The location was perfect for us as we were visiting family in PC. The neighbourhood so really nice and feels really safe.
We cannot recommend Lisa and her house enough and are already looking forward to planning our next trip!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my first stay at Lisa's place. I was unfortunately in town while my mother was a patient at Hospice of Laurens County, but this was so convenient - located 1.2 miles from the hospice house - that I felt comfortable being here because it was so close to the facility. The apartment itself is comfortable and accommodating. There's a big couch if you want to watch TV, and a round table area for meals or getting some work done. WiFi works well, and the bathroom is spacious with plenty of hot water. The neighborhood is 1 block from Presbyterian College and is a great and safe location for a morning walk or run. Lisa is a gracious host - frequently checking to see if there is anything you need, and she even surprised us with chocolate croissants a few times during my stay that lasted 13 nights. For the last few days of my stay, my kids and wife joined me, and my 13yo decided that even though it was mid-October, it seemed like a good time to make use of the pool, so she took advantage of that amenity which seems like a rarity for most AirBNB spaces. I would not hesitate to stay with Lisa again the next time I am in the area and need a room!"

I also loved the nice boat ramp that I was able to use to put my boat in right there at the house. My almost 2 year old son had a ton of space to run around outside when we weren’t on the water. Brian’s cottage is definitely saved to my favorites to come back for another long weekend soon!

Loved the option to add on the pontoon rental, but is the perfect place if you have your own boat as well as the cottage has its own boat ramp. Will definitely make an effort to stay here again, Brian is a fantastic host!"

We didn't get to use it but the firepit looked nice and there's firewood ready to use.
The pedal boat was fun to take out at sunset.
Brian was easy to work with and accommodated an early check in for us. Door code is easy to remember since it was unique to us.
Judging by the construction, future renters will have a new home quite nearby but for now this is a very private location."

Stayed a few nights","Michael was very responsive and helpful from the start! His cabin was exactly what we needed for a little peaceful getaway. There is some road noise that can be heard from time to time in the distance, but the view at sunset over the little pond and the stars at night make you totally forget about anything else. We loved sitting on the porch swing and heard lots of birds, owls, and even some coyote one night. The cabin is very homey and the pictures don't really do it justice. Honestly, the cobwebs in some of the corners just added to the vibe. It felt like we were staying at a family member's home, especially with how accommodating he was. If you're a light sleeper the bed is squeaky from even little movements but there are other options like in the loft upstairs, the soft couch, or the super comfortable blue chair in the living room! If we ever find ourselves in SC again, we will definitely look into going back!"

While drinking my morning coffee on the back porch I just couldn't help but think of the mention of the fully stocked pond that I was looking at. I finished my coffee and drove to the local hardware store for a cheapo rod and reel and some worms. 45 minutes later I was cleaning our dinner for that night...fish and grits with hush puppies. I could retire in a location like this without hesitation. Highly recommend

Stayed with a pet","Awesome Log Cabin getaway. (Yes, it's an actual log cabin). Michael (although we didn't get to meet him) was very responsive to my texts and told us if there's anything we need, just ask. The cabin itself was away from any city noises and was totally peaceful located by a large lake. Inside the cabin the living room was complete with large couch, chair, coffee table, tv/cd player and a huge fireplace (Yes, Michael had plenty of firewood available for us to use), several hunters trophies above the fireplace and an upstairs for additional guests. The kitchen was very clean and had all of the necessary cookware that we needed. It also had a full refrigerator complete with ice maker. The bedroom had that lazy country relaxed feeling with clean sheets. Plenty of closet space and a dresser for our use. The back area had a large screened in porch which would be great for summer months. We were looking for a place to ""get away"" for a few days and relax.........this was the place."

Stayed a few nights","First, it’s a cabin on a pond and a good ways off the main road with trees surrounding you and the pond. It’s got a huge back deck… part is a screened porch and part is like a party deck. This place is great for families, small group retreats, hunters, fisherman, or just folks who enjoy nature. Michael was very accommodating and stayed in touch. He never was too much or too little. Honestly I could live here and I might have found what I want for a retirement home one day. If you’re looking for a 5 star resort go to a 5 star resort but if you want a relaxing and comforting place that feels like home but with the peace and quiet of a cabin by a pond surrounded by nature this is it. We will certainly be back."

The log cabin is so perfect with a front porch, screened in back porch and a huge deck overlooking a pond stocked with fish!
We so enjoy drinking coffee and swinging first thing in the morning while listening to the crickets. We are going to have to come back in cooler weather to enjoy the huge fireplace just waiting to warm up the cabin.
You cannot find a better host than Michael either. Our precious dog got sick while we were on our way to the cabin and he recommended the perfect Vet for us. We peppered him with questions and he would immediately answer them!! You can NOT have any better host! Thank you Michael for letting us borrow your cabin one more time. See you next year!!"

All of the amenities of home with the exception of only 3 TV channels and no iron. But who irons there clothes and watches TV when there's fish to catch, right???

Stayed a few nights","In my professional environmental consulting business, we stay in Air-Bnb's all over the USA and we have not experienced ANY others that top this one located near Clinton, SC. The log cabin is located at the end of a nice gravel driveway and nestled within a picturesque 300-acre farm surrounded by pristine horse pastures and mixed pine and hardwood forest. The cabin had wonderful decks both front and back, and the back deck overlooks an approximate 2-acre fishing pond. This Air-Bnb features two very nice additional amenities that are extremely hard to find, a wonderful wood burning rock fireplace, and the freedom to have your family dog! I traveled here from Idaho just to go deer hunting for a week, but we were so impressed by the Air-Bnb and our great host, that my wife and I are already planning to return simply to enjoy the peaceful location and setting of this rare gemstone."

Stayed a few nights",Loved - loved - loved this place! It was exactly what we were looking for - secluded- quiet - lots of nature around. We could let our dogs off leash because it sits in the middle of a farm. Nice pond down the hill from the cabin - has an elevated deck and screened in porch - so lots of options for outdoor sitting. Very “cabin-y” decor - wood and rustic looking. Had everything you need to cook and the bed in the downstairs bedroom was comfortable enough. Only issues I would say is that the railing up to the loft is loose - could use some strengthening- but I didn’t think it was a hazard or anything. Also if you don’t like animal heads - there are 4 or 5 on the wall above fireplace - but that’s personal preference. Neither of these things were a damper on our weekend- we really loved it!

The last night, we all sat on the porch looking at the lightning bugs and listening to a whipperwill. So relaxing! We will definitely be going back!"

Michael’s cabin is located off a private drive of the farm that offered plenty of room for our dogs to explore and run around. Inside there is a large screened in porch as well as a massive deck area with a charcoal grill and bench seating that overlooks the spectacular lake. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and cookware and the family room is kept cozy with comfortable furniture, throw blankets and a wood burning fireplace. There is a DVD player with a small selection of DVDs and games/puzzles/cards. There is a walking path that winds around the lake and throughout the property for you to get some fresh air. If you are looking for a chill place to relax and unwind this is your place. My friend and our 2 dogs stayed 3 nights and are already planning our next stay back.

Stayed with a pet","Stay was amazing. The only reason the cleanliness wasn't 5 stars is because apparently there was a communication snafu with the cleaners and they hadn't been there after the last guest. Carlos was very apologetic, and very responsive in getting them to come & clean. I'm sure that won't happen again.
The lake was so peaceful, and the screen room was absolutely perfect! So comfy, and nice to be lakeside without worrying about bugs. The home was comfy, and the sheets were amazing - so soft they felt like silk! Wi-Fi worked perfectly.
Granddaughter visited and really enjoyed swimming, fishing and the kayak."

Sunset jewel had everything we needed for a quick, weekend getaway in a tranquil location, but close to restaurants. The digital lock was great to get in and out....the easiest I've experienced with air bnb rentals. My son took out the kayak and my other son enjoyed watching him from the floating dock. The home was spotless and felt like home for our weekend away. We would definitely stay here again!"

There is a public boat launch one road over if you want to bring your own and then dock at the private dock at the home. The outdoor screened living space was my favorite place to be for our visit, if we weren't fishing that's where I was. There are a couple of restaurants one mile down on Marina Cove if you don't feel like cooking. I love what was done with this property and we plan to return in the spring again. Both Carlos and Elise responded to my messages almost immediately with a couple of questions I had, excellent hosts. Thank you!"

We enjoyed fishing, kayaking, paddleboarding, and swimming during our stay. The view from the house's sliding glass door is fantastic, and you have a clear view of the water from the house. Our dogs loved that they could get to the lake from the shore. Public boat access is also within walking distance of the place, which was a perfect distance to walk our dogs. We only left the house once to run to the grocery store, a 15-minute drive, but even the drive was beautiful. If not sooner, we will return next year as we are considering renting again this fall."

We rented a center console motor boat from Lake Murray Boat Rentals 10 minutes across the lake and had a great time while using Googl Maps to cruise around the lake and it was easy to dock it at his pier. His rental also comes with a kayak and equipment that we didn’t use, but it was nice to have available.
Carlos was very responsive, friendly, and helpful, and we highly recommend renting from him! 😊"

The home is beautifully decorated and was clean upon arrival. The clear labels on light switches and remotes made it easy to find my way around and make myself at home. The screened enclosure just off the water was my favorite! It’s so relaxing and comfortable. It was also a great place for my 13 year old chihuahua, who has become sensitive to the sun, a perfect way to enjoy the outdoor serenity while staying cool. The added floating dock was really nice for fishing. I didn’t get a chance to check out the kayak or the fire pit; there was just so much to do, and I didn’t have enough time to do it! Next time I’ll book a longer stay!"

After being denied a booking from a different host, Evolve accepted our last minute rental even though I'm new to AirBnB. There weren't any reviews on this property and I was afraid to book. I'm glad that I did!
The wind blew away an item and Alicia (local contact) told me not to worry about replacing it. She was very quick in responding ( only had to contact her for the key code and about the item as the place was perfect). We are already looking at our calendar to book another trip."

Joan has many beautiful items in her home - a bit overwhelming for me in that sometimes searching for space in the bedrooms to put my own traveling items.

Group trip","Unfortunately, we were visiting Newberry for a funeral. Joan was great about letting us check in whenever we arrived in town and extended the checkout time. I know she wouldn't always be able to do that, but she made a point of blocking the next night to provide us late checkout. Joan was prompt to answer when I had questions.
The home was beautiful but keep in mind that this is an old home and that may mean a few inconveniences. For example, most of the electrical plugs outside of the kitchen are near the floor, so if the cord on your hair dryer or curling iron isn't long, you may have to slouch while styling your hair!
While I obviously didn't sleep in all the beds, it seemed that they all had mattress toppers. That made them a little too soft for me, but that's only a personal preference"

The seating from the kitchen to the front porch and everything in between was plentiful and comfortable. Speaking of comfort, the beds were very good quality. The shower had good water pressure and I was grateful to find a hair drier in the cabinet because I had forgotten mine. The back yard was very sweet, especially the lights in evening. It was a perfect setting for a spiritual activity were did. If I had to complain about anything, it would just be the nature of a very old house, and the kind of musty smell that can be detected by those of us sensitive to that sort of thing. If you have this issue, just remember your allergy meds, but by all means don't let stand in the way of checking out this beautiful home."

Joan was the perfect Hostess preparing for our arrival and being easily accessible during our stay. She even decorated the outside with Halloween surprises. How fun! And the beds were a delight…like sleeping on a cloud. We stayed at the home for our College Girls Weekend and couldn’t be more happy with our choice. We definitely recommend The Inspiration House to anyone looking for a beautiful, well appointed, and comfortable home-away-from home!"

Group trip","This house was amazingly beautiful. I loved the decor and the colors. It is like the photos. There was coffee in the refrigerator and plenty of kitchen supplies to cook, though we did not. We stayed here after my mother's funeral. The beds were comfortable, and I had a good night's sleep after a week of not sleeping well.
It was my first time back to Newberry in several years, so enjoyed going downtown and wandering into the opera house. The next morning, we went to the Figaro Market. Newberry is a very quaint town.
If you are elderly or just not steady on your feet, you do have to walk up stairs/steps to the front porch or back entrance. One of the bedrooms is on the first floor however.
We parked on the street and walked to the back and up the stairs to the lockbox."

Stayed with kids","Joan was incredibly helpful - allowing me to get a package at the house since I'm traveling so much. She also invited us to check in early, which was great since I'm working from the road. The house was full of incredible decor and furnishings, in some ways it felt like staying in a museum. The house is very large for the price! We had plenty of space to spread out. I also appreciate that she didn't use any strong scents - so many airBNBs have lots of glade plug-ins that accost you as soon as you walk in. It's a super easy walk to downtown Newberry! Really cute shops.
It's a very old house and has grand rooms with high ceilings so it got pretty cold some times. The kitchen is huge and well equipped, it was just a bit hard to find things. For a family, we didn't feel super comfortable to relax. The beds were comfy but none of the sitting areas felt cozy and relaxing to us. It's more of a romantic & fancy experience."

Our host, Joan, was a great help in finding a great nail salon. Newberry Nails in the Wal-Mart shopping center was a lot of fun and did a fantastic job on fill-in and pedis. We had a 2-hour wait so went to Cato and Burke's (just opened, similar to Ross). We ate at Shealey's BBQ which was okay, and The Front Porch in Richburg, which was fabulous. Make sure you stop at Laila's for donuts and icecream in the historic district. Enjoyable, quiet and a fun house to sit and ""look"" at everything."

So much to see and enjoy!
The house was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked. We cooked all our meals at the house and had everything we needed. The beds were super comfortable and the bathrooms included thoughtful amenities like shampoo and body lotion,etc.
The location is perfect-just a short walk into town and all Newberry has to offer. There was ample off street parking for three cars.

Her home was so welcoming and she had everything we needed. Would 100% recommend this for someone who is looking for a comfortable home away from home.

Stayed about a week","Inspiration House is a gorgeous old home which was perfect for our family 6-8 people. We had a wonderful and fun time visiting our daughter at college. The house had everything we needed, we were able to cook meals but also close to man street for coffee and some restaurants. Joan was helpful and very easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend Inspiration House!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Joan and Ryan’s lovely home. We had way more space than we needed, but really enjoyed the majestic home. So many extra special touches, and a quick walk to Main Street and shops and restaurants. I can imagine big families gathered around the large dining table, kitchen, and in the various sitting areas in years gone by. The decor was perfect and there are so many antiques to look at and photos and Joan and Ryan’s own photo books (be sure and spend some time looking at those)! We would love to spend more time in Newberry and in Joan’s home specifically...perhaps we can in the future, but we feel blessed we were able to have this special time. Thank you again!"

Group trip",We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Inspiration House! Joan was always quick to respond to any inquiries or questions that I had and gave me some good recommendations for Sunday brunch as well! My family and I enjoyed this beautiful historic home and would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to everyone. This was our first visit to Newberry and we came here for a wedding on Main Street and it was a very short walk to everything that we needed! The house was in very good condition and was very clean and the neighborhood was very safe and beautiful as well. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay for my family!

Stayed a few nights","Joans place is a beautifully maintained historical home directly in the heart of Newberry. There were some great restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was clean, cozy, and stylish. Everything you could need or want was available. Joan was very quick to respond. Check in was a breeze. You can’t say enough about the beauty and old southern charm of this home. It was absolutely gorgeous! Thank you for sharing your home with us!"
