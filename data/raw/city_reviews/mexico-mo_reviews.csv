Stayed one night","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful Airbnb property, and I can confidently say it exceeded all my expectations. Here are some highlights from my stay:
The location is absolutely perfect. Nestled in a quiet and serene neighborhood, the property offers breathtaking views that made my mornings truly special. It's close to local attractions and amenities, yet feels like a private retreat.
The property is incredibly comfortable, with all the amenities you could possibly need. The living spaces are spacious and well-designed, making it easy to relax and feel at home. The kitchen is fully equipped, allowing for easy meal preparation, and the bedroom is cozy and inviting.
Impeccably clean and well-maintained, the property made a great impression from the moment I walked in. It was clear that a lot of care goes into keeping the place in top condition."

Stayed with kids","I arrived to this place at night and definitely got lost. I believe the instructions were somewhat clear, but I may have just misunderstood them since I used the translator button. Definitely a beautiful place with an amazing view. Security guards were in the entrance of the building. Rosy & Diana were great hosts, very attentive. The place was decorated wonderfully. Place had a great smell. There were some essentials that ran out that we needed and the host did a wonderful job to make sure we had what we needed. Some things took a little longer to receive (which was understandable) so we purchased a few items and the host was nice enough to reimburse me. I would definitely come back and this time I will bring some of my items to avoid interrupting the host or I can ask them ahead of time to see what they have available.
Essentials: Extra toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, laundry detergent… etc."

Stayed about a week","Everything was so beautiful , the apartment was super modern and felt very private and safe. I stayed for 10 days and the only issue I encountered was that the TV in the bedroom remote control seemed to die on our first night so we had to download a universal Controller app on my phone to be able to use the television. There was a slight misunderstanding on our end about when to check out the host handled it amazingly, and was extremely responsive and nice even though we were in the wrong and we’re not ready to check out . There are so many amazing restaurants within 15 minutes and you could just take the elevator downstairs if you’re missing any amenities because there is an oxxo in the building as well as a bunch of other restaurants. Our most visited were definitely the coffee shop right across from the elevator and The Oxxo. It was a little bit hard for delivery drivers to find us sometimes because if they miss the sudden entrance to the building, they have to do a 5 minute loop."

Stayed with kids","The location of the building's reception is not very visible, since above the driveway there is the entrance to the parking lot but as there is also a shopping center and hotel, it becomes confusing, and the guards do not have enough information to direct people to the right place.
The apartment is small but exactly as shown in the pictures.
The decoration is nice and everything is very tidy, however we found trash on the kitchen shelves (beer cans).
In general, the place is clean.
Unfortunately, communication with host Estela was very bad. She was rude and rude, and mocks the times we had communication.
In advance, it was known that there were 7 of us who would stay and there were only 4 towels, so I recommend bringing your own, which is quite uncomfortable.
There are also not enough blankets, one of the guests had to be covered with their chamarra only. Bad experience. Wouldn't come back"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay for your Visa. The location is in a safe gated community. When I first arrived, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Maria converted a regular three-story home into several apartments, and it was a bit confusing at first. I wasn't sure if I was renting just a bedroom with a shared bathroom because inside my unit there was another bedroom that was locked. And the front door to my unit didn't have a keyed lock which meant I had to constantly remove and lock all my personal bathroom items in my bedroom every time I left. It would have been much easier if the main lock was placed on the apartment entrance door. Another downside was the bed. The mattress was really hard, and the bed frame made it difficult to get in and out of bed when sharing with a partner. But despite these minor inconveniences, the place was excellent. Maria's communication was top-notch, which really made the whole experience much smoother. Overall I'd say it's a great place to stay for the price."

Very close to the consulate if you want to go to do a driveway basically 10 min away by car.
The place was very clean and tidy, I really felt at home, comfortable bed, clean bathroom.
For observation and recommendation:
I don't know if I didn't know how to take it or the minisplit didn't work because it didn't get hot or cold, and it wouldn't hurt to place a set of glass, cup, spoon plate, and fork.
Thank you for your attention to Maria and for the rent of your space."

Stayed a few nights","I highly recommend the stay, the room and bathroom are super comfortable, with amenities such as hot water, steam iron, soap, towels, etc., they are very clean and the treatment of the host is super good, she is very attentive so much before and during your stay, very attentive to your needs and doubts of the cd. ; as for the proximity to the American consulate it is super well located approx. 9 to 11 minutes and the access roads to the subdivision super well, nearby there are commercial spaces, supermarkets, restaurants, etc. And the security in the subdivision and in the rooms is excellent, I would definitely stay again and 100% recommended."

It should be noted that in the apartment, everything is super clean, with a good space for up to 3/4 people. Personally, I loved that without asking for it, the first time you put in a crib for my baby & this time up to a touch of a stuffed animal. It's a more enchanted one, because it's newly remodeled. José Luis is ready to stand out.
I'll be clear again that I'll rarely find a host focused on making his guests feel good."

Stayed about a week","We had a great time at Angie & Javier's place. The place was easy to find and is situated in a quiet affluent neighborhood of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Monterrey.
Upon arrival, Angie was waiting to greet us outside and let us into the gated parking area for the building. She brought us up in the elevator to the 6th floor and acquainted us with the apartment. After familiarizing us with the ACs and TVs, Angie showed us around the well equipped kitchen. From the kitchen you can see beautiful views of the city and the Sierra Madre mountains that surround Monterrey. There is a clicker to open and close the gated parking area which made things very easy when driving in and out of the property. The view out of the apartment is to the south so you never have the problem of the sun blaring in your face at sunset.
The apartment is very spacious and fit our family of 5 comfortably with plenty of room to relax. All of the beds are extremely comfortable and you can tell that Angie and Javier invested in good mattresses. The place is very quiet and all of us slept great throughout our entire trip. We took an Uber a couple of times and it was easy for the driver to find the place with no problems. If you need any items from the store, there is a small convenience store (OXXO) within a two minute walk from the apartment.
If we are ever back in Monterrey, we will stay here again. Thanks for a great experience!"

The property isn't worth it. For many reasons.
1era TVs are 20 years old, they tell you they have roku and amazon, and these are not served, they are not connected and the controls do not have a stack.
2nd All sound systems are disconnected.
3rd All the walls, from the kitchen and iodos, the bathrooms and rooms are dirty, just like the couch and the lamps.
4 of the finishes are torn apart in various parts, they do not invest money in the property.
5 Upon entering there are other regulations in which you are asked for private information by cell phone and extra fines with exaggerated prices.
6ta In the end I could only use 10% of the property as it is not functional."

Stayed with kids","The hosts' assistance was very good, starting from the reception, very attentive to what will be needed from day one.
As for the apartment, it looks much newer and has better maintenance in photos than it really is, the main problem is the hot water in the back rooms, which does not always arrive and in cold weather it is essential. And on the other hand some furniture has little maintenance and is possible to be damaged without much effort, which will impact being paid by the tenant given the strict policies of the owner.
For the cost, I have suggested that Javier fix these small details, the property has a lot of potential by place and location but the lack of maintenance and cleaning clouds the good experience you could have."

The home is just what we needed. Safe, secure and modern vibes. Each bedroom has its own bathroom, which was perfect, since we were traveling with friends.
Angie is a fabulous host. My wife and I didn’t want to leave. So nice, and close to many shopping centers.
Thank you so much for the hospitality!

Each room has their own bathroom which makes it quite convenient for groups. The place feels private since each apartment occupies the entire floor with parking available. We have self checked in - instructions provided were very easy to follow. Angie responded timely which made our entire experience enjoyable. I would recommend to bring your own speaker to play music since the sound system connectors not adapted to newer Apple products. I would highly recommend Javier’s place."

The apartment is in a perfect area with hundreds of places to eat/shop/dance, or just have a peaceful walk in the park. Additional plus is that Mauricio's place is accessible through the elevator and stairs (helps a lot with heavy suitcases). I will always recommend it to all my friends who visit the city."

The only problem is the current situation in central valley with the streets under construction, but it is understood that it is not a direct situation on Airbnb. Mauricio's excellent service was always on the lookout and favored us to check out later. The only thing I would comment on is that a towel was stained and there was no soap and/or shampoo but it was the least. The apartment in general is super good, super recommended!!"

Stayed with kids","airbnb was just as described on listing. Easy check in, easy to get around. Location is in downtown MTY there’s lots to do around. Stayed here with 4 kids they had a blast in the pool. As someone who works out on the regular , the gym was spot on. it had everything you needed for a quick/good workout while enjoying the view of pool and mountains. The host was very quick to respond when needed. My 3 year old exploring the house locked the door on the first day we got there, Leslie responded to my emergency and got that sorted out within minutes. If you will be driving your own vehicle around town host provides private parking. Security in this location is 24/7 you will not be able to enter without showing credentials. Overall, the apartment was great and so was the host. Will definitely visit again soon."

The place was clean and beautifully decorated.
Leslie and Eder, communicated well and provided a list of places where my family and I could go eat. Because of this I felt like we were able to enjoy our stay more.
I like that this apartment had restaurants so close to the building.
They had a cute coffee shop that I loved to go to. They make fresh pastries daily.

Stayed a few nights","It is a very nice depto, but there is too much noise in the evenings being glued to the San Pedro antros area, which should be taken into account for the price of the rent. There is a lot of noise every night from Wednesday to Saturday until 2:00 am.
Several recommendations. The hooks at the top of the closet are too high (for people of 1.90 and above). I recommend putting a mirror in the guest bathroom (no there). Also put a bureau on each side of the bed. The water pressure is very irregular in all the apartment keys (no problem in the area, I have stayed in many deptos in San Pedro). It is a nice depto but if they intend to charge that price they have a lot to improve."

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed here on several occasions, Guillermo and Monica are excellent hosts, attentive and non-invasive. This recent visit I had inconveniences that were taken care of. The reception was not as before, some details were missing such as napkins, cleaning, there was dust, there is something old pillows perceived and there was an unpleasant smell that came out of the bathroom, I noticed it just upon arrival and it persisted a day and a half. It is not comfortable to deal with something like this during the stay, as a repair/cleaning takes time that is not always counted on, but the hosts said that they would fix this issue right away upon my departure and were attentive to my feedback. I really appreciate every time Guillermo and Monica welcomed me, with this feedback I look forward to keeping the service that has been excellent until this occasion."

There were topics with hot water and the internet the first day and they came instantly to help. There is only one complaint, the sound of the water pump is very loud so it could disturb some, especially when there are other guests in the other Guillermo airbnbs. In addition to that, the location is excellent, a 10-minute walk to centrito. A 5/5"

Stayed a few nights",Guillermo's profile states that he is an executive in retirement.... And indeed you get to confirm that the stay is the result of the elegant vision of an educated man. You get everything you might need in a very orderly and precise fashion! Excellent!

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Guillermo’s place was great from start to finish. He sent me all instructions via message, making my check-in super fast and convenient. During my stay, the neighborhood and area were very quiet and tranquil. This is a very safe and well located area. There are tons of restaurants a short walk away. There is also a park with a running trail a few blocks away. This is the perfect setup for a single person or couple with low maintenance cooking needs to enjoy a short or long term stay in the best part of Monterrey!"

Very comfortable furniture, a Samsung TV to stream to from your phone at the touch of a button, loads of electricity sockets in the most convenient places, a beautiful outdoor porch, and staff on-hand to help you with any requests you might have. Guillermo is also genuinely interested in the people who stay with him, and if you want to chat, he’ll be a WhatsApp message away! Looking forward to staying here again in the near future."
