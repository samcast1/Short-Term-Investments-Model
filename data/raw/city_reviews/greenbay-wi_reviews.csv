Stayed about a week","The location of this home was perfect! The neighborhood was quiet with a large park down the block. We don’t have little ones but the park had lots of room to play and a splash pad for the summer months. Convenient to be minutes from downtown GB and Lambeau Field. The games in the basement are such a fun touch and the fireplace outside was great to hang around. As described, this home is smaller but still more spacious and private than a hotel room (with 4 people) and for the week we stayed, much more cost effective! Also, Tracy was wonderful as a host and quick to respond—we wouldn’t hesitate to book with her again."

Stayed a few nights","Tracy's property is an amazing home to spend a weekend in Green Bay. Felt right at home clean and cozy feel, making you feel right at home. Tracy was always available and answered instantly when we reached. The address is lite up so you can see the house number anytime of day. safety lock for a safe feeling knowing the always locked behind us, super ease of access as the renter. The game room in the basement was super fun with multiple games including our favorite of all the games light up airhockey table! We are one well rested family. With two more appointments planned in Appleton in the coming months we plan to rent this home again. One happy family!"

Stayed with kids","The little house did not disappoint! We were in town to watch my oldest son play hockey. The hockey team stays at a different hotel from the family so I opted for this cute Airbnb so our toddlers wouldn’t be cooped up in a hotel room.
The kids loved the arcade area in basement. We made meals and watched movies. Slept in with the black out curtains. Visited the children’s museum one day just a short drive away. Comfortable Home away from home. Will definitely stay at one of Tracy’s places again when in the area!
Thank you!"

We didn't use the arcade games, etc, as much as I thought we would, but it was nice to have those things there. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. The home was very well organized, with clear instructions. Tracy was awesome in responding quickly to my queries. I would stay there again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Tracy's home in Green Bay was an amazing experience. My dad, a huge Packers fan, got to see his first game at Lambeau (a 20 min walk from the house) and coming home to Tracy's house was great. Great recommendations for nearby food, everything you need in the kitchen, including Keurig OR standard drip coffee options. The downstairs game room was a lot of fun. Great spot to spend down time. There are convenience/liquor stores no more than a 15 min walk away, and plenty of delivery options as well. If I were ever in GB again with a small group, I would definitely try booking this again. Tracy also went above-and-beyond in securing a portable chess set that we could play outside.
Thanks again for everything Tracy!"

Tracy is friendly and responsive and made us feel very welcome. The quiet neighborhood felt safe and gave us great access to Lambeau Field, the Titletown District and so many of our favorite Green Bay restaurants and attractions. We are SO glad we booked this charming home for our stay."

Stayed with kids","Tracy is a very proactive host who made sure everything was set as soon as I booked (and she even offered tips on hosting when I'd mentioned I hope to do the same). I arrived at the tail end of once-in-years blizzard, and Tracy made sure things were cleared on time and that everything was in working order. The home itself is exactly as described. I'll be honest: I didn't read about the amenities too carefully, so my kids and I were happily surprised to find air hockey and foosball in the basement, and I was grateful for a well-equipped kitchen. The neighborhood is cozy, and just a few blocks away is the last Red Owl grocery store out of what had been over 400 stores! Of course, the stadium is just a mile away, and the mall is not much farther. Overall, the ""Little House"" is a great place to spend with a couple of kids, and I wouldn't hesitate to rebook."

Stayed a few nights","Tracy's house came as advertised, and exceeded expectations! My friend and I traveled to Green Bay to experience an authentic game day, Lambeau experience! Tracy's house more than helped us fulfill that experience. The house was perfectly situated in a quiet neighborhood within a pleasant walking distance to the stadium and provided a great 'home base' for us for the weekend.
Tracy was extremely easy to coordinate with, making the check in/out process simple and seamless. The beds were extremely comfortable and allowed us to rest up and expend maximum energy watching the game!
As an avid football fan, I've always heard that you should attend a game in Green Bay. I can now attest to that sentiment, and can also say, stay at Tracy's house if you're looking for the true Lambeau neighborhood experience. Even though my beloved Patriots lost, I couldn't have asked for a better experience or a better place to stay."

Stayed one night","This was the most charming little house ever. Perfect for our small birthday party for 6. It was very tastefully decorated, and had all the accommodations you could expect in a very quiet neighborhood. Tracy was the perfect host, communicating within the hour for every inquiry. I would highly recommend staying here if you have 4 or fewer people. It was perfect."

Owner was very communicative and super quick to reply. Great touches! Coffee, tea, Crystal Light, shampoo and conditioner, game room in the clean and accessible basement, well-appointed kitchen with everything you need to prepare meals. Good WiFi. Huge TV in living room and TVs in the two bedrooms with Roku. Very comfortable large couch and recliner. Dining table and chairs for four. Entry system easy and secure. Backyard, partially fenced. This was the perfect place to come home and relax after spending the day exploring Green Bay! Owner was quick to address an issue with the bed linens. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. Very cozy, appropriately named!"

I didn’t have to bring any items at all, she’ll have it available. The Pamperin Park next to the house is a beautiful park, good for a relaxing walk and exercise. Mexico Elnido is a great Mexican restaurant nearby. The house has the best quality of furnishings and just great to stay in a place like this as if you’re getting pampered. I can’t wait to stay here again but hopefully when it’s a warmer season. Thanks for being the best host and having the best stay experience."

Getting there, the location at first was a little odd when you arrive being it’s at dead end and there is signs that say “no motor vehicles.”(But, it’s just because the driveway is next to the right , it’s the trail to Pamperin park, this beautiful place you need to go wander around, and If you have kids, they would LOVE the playground. ) But the whole place was perfectly clean, cozy, and you could park in the garage! They had a fire pit and chairs, even firewood! A big, beautiful serene back yard and they have a charcoal grill (didn’t use it but was a great option) They had the kitchen perfectly stocked with whatever it was you needed to cook a full meal with, I honestly didn’t eat out one day in the 3 days there for one meal because it truly was a perfect kitchen! And the main bedroom had an extremely comfy bed and also a huge plus, a washer/dryer and I actually did a few loads which was great! I honestly would love to stay here again! 10/10 stars!"

Jody recommended a Mexico Lindo and Gallaghers for Italian and we ate dinner at both…. So good!! We were able to use the home’s well equipped kitchen to make breakfast and lunch there. Woodmans and meijer are minutes away. If you have kids, make sure to take a short walk to the new Pamperin playground! It’s super cool. I would recommend this airbnb to anyone I know !

Right when we walked in there were local treats and snacks giving us a warm welcome. Entry was seamless and very easy. Jody communicated quickly and provided clear instructions. My Uncle and I had an amazing time and will definitely look to stay here again in the future!

Stayed a few nights","The place was absolutely lovely! It was so much cuter than I could have expected. This was actually my first time using Airbnb, so not going to lie, I was a little nervous! The trip was a birthday treat for my boyfriend so we could see a concert. I thought it would be fun to have a nice weekend away from being a big city.
The tiny house was modern and very clean! I wasn't expecting it to be so well stocked with kitchen stuff and bathroom stuff. Even little things like an umbrella being there in case it rained was just lovely to see around.
Having a bonfire pit is always a nice touch to me, but it was extra helpful that Jody had some things to help us start the fire along with wood.
Not only did I appreciate the interior of the home, but I wanted to shout of the exterior too! Sure, it is cute, but also having that bright yellow door really helped with finding the place! lol.
Luckily, I had no issues and was in no need to contact Jody, but between the airbnb message system and by providing her phone number she also made it very comfortable to contact her should something come up- which I highly appreciated.
Thanks again so much for the stay. If we ever find ourselves in Green Bay again, I know where to go."

Stayed a few nights","The best place for a stay in Green Bay. Our family enjoyed our weekend at Jody’s place when we came up for a Packers game. Everything was super clean, comfortable, and convenient. The beds were comfortable, and having a full kitchen was a great convenience. We picked up some food at the grocery store down the street and were able to cook for ourselves, rather than eat out for every meal. The bathroom was spotless, and the whole house was recently updated. The garage was perfect to park in with the snow. We absolutely will stay again if in the Green Bay area. So close to everything. Thank you, Jody!"

Location was perfect. Quiet and right by a beautiful park.
Clean. Spacious. Was bummed I didnt get to use the fire pit outside but will definitely use it next time!
If you like to cook like myself, you have pretty much everything you need to play chef, even spices!
Will definitely come back."

It was only minutes from Lambeau, offers walks in the park right outside the door with no driving required, and was in a quiet location. The updates were done perfectly, in a modern style, maximizing the use of the space. Every update was very nicely done. I would definitely recommend staying here for a group of 4 or less, and I would love to stay here again next time we're in town."

The house itself is nicely decorated, the bed was comfortable and all rooms were squeaky clean. Streaming services and WiFi were available but we didn’t use them. I would recommend this rental to couples and small families without hesitation."

The house is right next to an old park entrance. We explored the area daily; saw a wide variety of wildlife. Their deck is lovely and we often ate breakfast out there. They have thought of everything. Nothing is lacking. On top of their special touches, everything is shiny new. The home is beautifully remodeled. An extra perk was indoor parking in the attached garage!! The house is close to everything. We enjoyed exploring Green Bay, nearby towns and the bay. Ehren and Jody gave us many great tips on places to dine or visit. Mostly, we just loved this haven they’ve created. They are extremely kind and helpful. We’d love to visit again. Thank you two for everything!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This house was clean, organized and stylish. We appreciated the extra touches with flowers and the ready to use fire pit. Jody was very fast to respond to texts and she was flexible and helpful with check in and check out. The code lock for the front door was convenient and the home had what we needed stocked. I loved the robes, extra cozy blankets, and plenty of towels. The beds were comfortable. It would have worked better for a family with 1-2 kiddos instead of 3 professionals (one slept on the pull out in the living room) but it worked. One bathroom for three professionals also wasn't ideal since the bedrooms were so close together but would probably would be good for a family. The shower was small for our taller staff. I assumed it would be closer to something walking distance or near downtown (I am not familiar with the area) so we were a little surprised about being 10-15 minutes from places we needed to go. We learned a lot =) Overall we loved the house and experience. We need a slightly bigger space for our group but this would be wonderful for a fam,
Best,

It is a rather nervous time for my family, as she is the youngest, so being able to feel not only welcomed but comfortable was immensely important to us.
Travis provided an elaborate packet with all of the information we could need. His communication was timely and compassionate, which I appreciated greatly.

We were in town for the Packers game and Travis’s place was in the perfect location for us. It’s close enough to easily walk to Lambeau yet far enough to not be disturbed by the packer fans celebrating the win afterwards. This was our first time to be in Green Bay and it’s now going to be a tradition. We’ll definitely stay here again.

Travis was a great host with a beautiful home and, in my opinion, a very great deal with all of the amenities and accommodations that were provided (and so close to Lambeau)! Being able to grab a cup of coffee in the morning and take a walk around Lambeau Field was a dream come true and something I wish I could do every single day. It's a great quiet location but just walking distance from everything you need in Green Bay! This will absolutely be my first check when another Green Bay trip comes across our plate! I can't say enough great things about this place and, specifically, Travis as he was such a great and responsive host who made everything so simple. Absolutely recommend anyone to book this as soon as possible to not miss out on this great house! Go Pack Go!"

We came into town from Texas for the Packers game and his house was the best location at the best price. Lambeau field is viewable from his front porch! The house was spotless and we had absolutely everything we needed to rarely leave the house except for a tour and the game. It had snowed a bunch and his house was super cozy and warm despite the temp being in the teens. We hung around, slept in in the most comfortable bed and had fun watching games on TV and playing cards at his kitchen table. Check out could not have been easier, either. Thank you, Travis! We will definitely be back for another game in the future and hope to stay again."

Travis was very easy to work with from start to finish. He was super responsive - prompt, informative and cheerful in his communications. The check-in and check-out instructions were a breeze. Travis also provided basic household information/instructions which made our stay very comfortable and stress-free.
We found the home to be just as described. We were impressed by the cleanliness, accuracy of the website description/photos, and the thoughtful details found throughout the home (additional toiletries, fluffy towels, comfy bedding, etc.). The kitchen was well stocked and included a Keurig, various cooking utensils and pots/pans – which was perfect since we ate our meals “in”. There was ample room for the four of us to linger around the table or hang out in the living room.
The house was perfectly located – a 15-minute walk to the stadium – and in a quiet neighborhood which was so relaxing after attending the game. We wholeheartedly recommend this home and its gracious owner, Travis!"

Favorite perks: ✨ Beds were SO warm and comfy! Couch also comfortable to sleep on. TV ready with streaming services. The coffee available in the morning (and drinks in the fridge!) was the icing on the cake. Was super impressed Travis provided travel-sized bathroom items--things you'd probably forget or easily run out of on your trip. Definitely saved us a trip to a store. There's a nice patio area and yard in the back with a grill!
Travis was a great host! The place was so clean and so nice--the easiest and best Airbnb stay I've had! Will definitely be looking to stay here next visit. Thank you so much!!! 😊"

The beds were very comfy and the living area was perfect for relaxation in the mornings and evenings. We will most definitely stay again when we are back in Green Bay!!

The house itself is kept very clean and clutter free. It feels spacious inside and has everything a person needs to feel comfortable and cozy--soft and fluffy linens, comfortable mattresses, great pillows, a big couch, a large dining table, etc. Highly recommend!"

Very clean and recently updated - appreciated the new carpet and cleanliness of the entire house. Good location right off interstate and near some restaurants (highly recommend Uncle Mike's for breakfast!), gas stations and not too far from UW-Green Bay campus. Rock and Roll music buffs will love the atmosphere in this place - very tastefully done and all of the photos of these Hall of Famers are one of a kind! Use of garage is a nice touch and the beds are very comfortable. We enjoyed our two-night stay as we spent some time working virtually from here as well as exploring nearby Door County.

Stayed with kids","As the description says, ""Rock Hall"" is indeed very clean and comfortable. It was perfect for us, and far superior to a hotel room. The pictures are fun, plants and other decor are well thought out, and the amenities are plentiful. It's a newer house with a king, queen, and bunk beds. The lower bunk bed is full size, with the upper being a twin. The shower has a double shower head, with a detachable handle with hose that is long enough for younger kids. The addition of the baby equipment is nice, and there's some folding outdoor chairs in the corner if you want to sit out on the patio. The appliances are pretty new, and all work very well. Being able to pull into the garage to load/unload the car was nice. Jon's communication was spot on. Great experience; wish we'd stayed longer. Rock on Jon."

I highly recommend choosing this house when traveling to Green Bay. Why risk a bad experience… this HOUSE and HOST is a WiNNER!
AND… how bout those Packers! GO PACK GO"

Marcy was on the ball the whole time - always accommodating, answering every question, making lots of recommendations - ""How can we make your stay perfect"" was the phrase that stuck with me - believe me this is one to make sure you book for those special family getaway weekends or travels - we loved it"

The host communicated quickly whenever we had questions. While I am giving this 5 stars, the largest downside to the house is that it is very old and that there is a smell that bothered a few of us. We were there for a few nights and could even smell it on our clothes when we got home."

She thought of everything that one would need for a pleasant stay, especially for families. The grand kids LOVED the games in the basement AND their own private""cheese"" room. They thought you fixed it up just for them! My husband and I, daughter and son in law enjoyed the extremely comfortable beds! TV's ??!!!, my goodness, in every room!!! What a luxury. Unfortunately did not make it to the outside for that bonfire. Next time. Let me tell you, it was a pleasure to be able to walk from Lambeau to your home instead of sitting in that traffic, or be in a loud small hotel room! Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your lovely appointed Air B and B. GO PACK GO!!!!"

This is a Packer themed house that is tastefully decorated and designed, and SO clean!
We are a family of 6, and have kids ranging in age from 21–10.
There was something for everyone in this home!
The things that stuck out the most to me was how CLEAN everything was!
Everything felt “fresh.”
It was nice to cook meals, throw in a load of laundry and have the beds all be so soft after long days of hanging out at Lambeau Field and Titletown.) (This home is less than a 2 minute drive to Lambeau Field and easily walkable).
Marcy was super accessible and accommodating. She reached out to make sure everything was going well and to see if we needed anything. So appreciative of that!
Our family will definitely look into staying in this house again so we can rest our CheeseHeads!"

Marcy definitely has an eye for design as everything was very aesthetic, modern, and has everything listed and described to a T.
We can only hope to have the opportunity to come back and visit for a Packers game-day!!!"

The place had every amenity we could possibly want: from coffee and snacks to a stocked kitchen and all the toiletries you could need. The attention to detail was impressive, with comfortable mattresses, ample sitting areas, thoughtful placement of hooks and charging stations, and even cleaning supplies readily available. Brooke was also quick to respond and flexible with accommodations.
The off-street parking was a great convenience, and the home itself was beautifully decorated. We were so inspired by the decor that we took photos to use as inspiration for our own home. We wish we knew where the owner found all the interesting pieces!
It's clear that a lot of thought and care went into decorating and hosting. We've stayed in many Airbnbs, but this one is definitely one of our favorites. We hope it will be available to book again on our next visit. Highly recommend!"

Stayed over a week",I was here for an extended stay while working in the area. The home was extremely clean and cozy. The neighborhood quiet. Home was as advertised via pictures. Garage is available for parking if needed. I enjoyed staying here. The home was very clean and comfortable! My only complaint was a total lack of snow removal during a 2 day winter storm which resulted in me having to shovel the driveway each day before and after working 12 hour shifts. The area received 6+ inches each day so it was impossible to get out or back in without clearing the driveway. The owner stated his regular plow guy was on vacation and his college age back up was on spring break. The owner did offer to pay for an uber but I was not confident I would be able to book a ride after work given the weather conditions so I declined. A snow removal company did arrive around 1am on the second day but only cleared the sidewalks as I had already shoveled the driveway upon my return home that evening.

We loved the garage access for our car, and the door locks were smooth/simple. Loved the tech - thermostat, Alexa, Sonos, TV, lights, record player. Great music library provided, and easy wireless connectivity to your phone. We stayed just us two the first night, and our friends came the second night for the Packer game. As a bungalow style rental for 2, and as a game day rental with friends, the house was equally suited for both. We hope to make it back and stay here many more times in the future!"

There's a dartboard, a bunch of records and CDs, and an Atari, which were nice touches. It was also nice to have a park around the corner to take the dogs for some exercise.

I always post something that I didn’t like or would have liked to see. So here it is my wife wants a TV in the bedroom. That was the only complaint I heard all weekend.

What really surprised us was how QUIET it was! If you look on a map, you'll see it's near major thoroughfares and downtown, and you might expect it to be noisy. IT ISN'T! We live in a small town in rural SW Wisconsin, and this place rivaled ours for how quiet it was.
We loved the accommodations! The couches and bed were comfortable and everything worked perfectly. To be fair, we ate out the night we arrived and were on a REALLY tight schedule in the morning, so we didn't use the kitchen, but the things we did use worked perfectly. Next time we need a place to stay in Green Bay, Julie's place will be at the top of our list!"

Stayed one night","This was our second stay at Julie's home. It's always like coming to your own house. Her bathroom is stocked as though 4 females live there - various shampoos and lotions and pretty much everything a person has in their own bathroom. As before, nice little snacks in the kitchen, coffee, tea, etc. One thing that is beyond Julie's control is the state of the streets in her neighborhood. They are horrible. Potholes, huge bucklings, crevices, etc. You have to go very slow or you'll knock something off your car. Otherwise, the neighborhood itself is nice and peaceful."

The memory foam mattress was sooooo comfortable!! There were even some snacks to boot. One thing to be aware of: the shower was really small, and would likely be pretty uncomfortable for anyone living in a larger body. This is also not an accessible property, as There are stairs outside and inside to navigate. (Though this may be noted in the listing.) We didn't meet the hostess in person but she was very communicative and responsive. We would absolutely stay here again and recommend it!!"

The unit was stocked with amenities like extra toiletries, shower soaps, snacks, coffee, breakfast bars etc. It was slightly further than walking distance from the stadium however we had no problem getting Ubers before and after the game. Would highly recommend!"

There were A/C wall units in both bedrooms and living room. The master bed had a great mattress - my son said he slept well. We used the kitchen one night and had enough pots and pans to make our dinner. Julie offered to set up the gas grill, so we were able to grill up a steak too. No dishwasher, but it was not a problem to hand wash. Overall a cute set-up and reasonably priced."

Basement having the foosball table and bags was a nice touch but as most basements are - the cement walls wasn’t the style we wanted to hang out in.

She uses her communication to gather intelligence in order to provide the best customer service possible.
Her place is comfortable, well decorated, she makes good use of her space, she provides snacks, the appliances and furniture are in great condition, and her responsiveness is the best I’ve seen.
Without doubt, Jami is the best hostess I’ve had in my Airbnb experience and I’m very picky.
The place is in a historic district and from the outside it would be hard to appreciate the gem it is on the inside.
One must access the unit from the back and the unit is in the basement but it doesn’t feel like it.
Jami’s place provides a similar experience an archeologist may have when discovering an unassuming entrance to a beautiful treasure.
Jami blessed me during my stay by providing information, goodies and amazing customer service.
Highly recommended."

She said she would ensure there was one in the house. She ended up bringing her own Ninja into the house! She left me a handwritten note telling me fresh farm eggs were in the fridge and prepared a basket of goodies. Jami also cut fresh lilacs for the kitchen and the bedroom. All the personal touches could not have been more wonderful. I felt right at home at Jami's place and she made me feel like family. If I could give Jami 100 stars I absolutely would!"

I walked in and was greeted by a lovely welcome note from Jami & Kevin, some snacks and bottled water, and they even had the lights on for me, which was really nice. And, listen, as a curly haired girl who had limited space in her overnight bag, THEY EVEN HAVE A DIFFUSER WITH THE HAIRDRYER. If you know, you know. Everything was fresh and comfortable, and it was easy to find, easy to park, and all around a charming hidden gem. I’ll definitely be back next time I have to come up to Green Bay!"

We love that this place was very clean, upholds their pet free policy very well, and did not use any artificial fragrances in the home. All the rooms are spacious and have good black out curtains. If you like a mattress on the softer side like we do, we found the beds real comfy and bedding super cozy. Anything we needed was accessible in a 5 minute radius - even a farmers market across the street! This airbnb is one I will definitely be coming back to."

Not only did we get to explore Green Bay, but it wasn’t actually too far from Peninsula State Park. We actually drove up there as well when we came to visit. Overall, I would highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time!! Very clean, spacious living area with exactly what we needed for our trip. Excellent location - nearby lots of coffee, shops, and convenient stores. A quick 5 minute ride to the stadium and a 45 min walk home if you want to avoid traffic/high Uber fees! Tracy was amazing and confirmed our reservation ASAP so we could snag this last minute trip to see the packers!! She was very proactive asking if we had any questions, making recommendations, and was always super responsive. 5 stars!!"

Stayed a few nights","Tracy was an amazing host and this was an awesome place to stay for a Packer home game weekend. Tracy was extremely proactive with giving out info regarding the AirBnB, and was very responsive to messages and answered all of my questions with patience and kindness. She made everything easy, intuitive, and seamless, we were able to enjoy our stay in privacy but I felt as though I could reach out to her at any moment with a question and she wouldn't hesitate to help. The king-sizes bed is AMAZING and the free shuttle to Lambeau right across the street was the cherry on top. We would happily stay there again!"

We had trouble figuring out the TV, but Tracy gave us instructions on how to use and offered to come over, if we were unable to figure it out. It was easy peasy:)"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at this house. Great location only 2 miles from Lambeau with a free bus stop to the stadium across the street. We ended up walking home after the game to avoid traffic which was an easy walk. House feels much bigger due to a good layout and a large kitchen.
In addition to great location and nice place to stay, Tracy was by far the best Airbnb host I’ve ever had. She let us check in a little early and stayed in contact with us throughout the stay making sure we were happy and see if we needed anything. And contrary to many hosts, we didn’t have to completely clean the house after paying a cleaning fee. Simply standard be a good human and clean up after yourself type stuff and that’s all. I can’t wait to come back and stay at another Tracy hosted property :)."

We are from California and did not know what to expect visiting Green Bay besides the fact that it’d be super cold. Tracy not only gave us advice on what to pack. But also gave us current weather conditions, suggested restaurants in the area for our family to dine at. She truly made it the best experience we could’ve had. This house was in the perfect area. Everything was literally across the street or in walking distance from us. We will most definitely be contacting her on our next trip."

The bus for the Packers game is across the street, but we ended up walking and it was not a bad walk. The only thing that my family mentioned was they wished the beds were a little more comfortable. Nevertheless, would stay here again if in town again!"

We were in town for the Nascar race at Elkhart Lake a comfortable drive by any means. The unit is stocked with most kitchen necessities. There are two large bedrooms and ceiling fans in almost every room. We were in Green Bay over the July 4th holiday and enjoyed the great city fireworks display and the various local citizen displays.
Tracy is interested in your enjoyment and communicates every detail you will need. Regular checkups by Tracy ensures your time in the unit meets your expectations.
We were not disappointed in this Airbnb experience, our 5th total.
