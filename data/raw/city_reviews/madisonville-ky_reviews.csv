Stayed a few nights","I echo the reviews that speak to Andrew being a great host. Friendly, welcoming, responsive. He actually went shopping the day of our arrival to make sure we had an item I asked about. What service! And we were met with a vase of lovely purple bearded irises-such a great welcome treat.
Andrew has made great use of the space. We were two couples and enjoyed the layout as one bedroom feels almost like a detached residence, providing a good bit if privacy.
The kitchen, as stated already in multiple reviews, was very well stocked. I always cook, so this is important to me. There are lots of pots and pans, dishes, cups, etc. I appreciate things like the drip coffee pot with coffee filters available. Coffee, tea and condiments for both are provided. Great bathroom towels.
We used this home as a base for our trip which included a couple of distilleries, a winery and the brewery that is within walking distance from the house. The downtown area with restaurants is very close."

Stayed a few nights","The place was nice, but the issue is the neighbors being super loud at all hours, the other neighbor has a recreational habit that he likes to sit out on the steps of his trailer and smoke a substance not legal, as I sent Andrew a message he decided to call the law, well that made it worse as now they knew the law was called on them and we were the only new people around. We ended up leaving early concerned about all of our tools and belongings in bed of truck. We left at 2am a day early and he didn’t offer a refund or anything but a im sorry we contacted the police. We have warned a bunch of others that work for our company not to stay here, pretty unfair to leave and not a refund or anything, but I’m sorry. Not a good way to do business when word of mouth travels fast. Again I would not recommend if you aren’t into recreational habits, or if you can withstand the yelling that comes with it from
Neighbors till atleast midnight. Andrew himself good person and communication but not as a business person."

Stayed about a week","Host were very responsive and helpful.
The house was in the perfect part of town and close to the centre of Madisonville. The local restaurants and bars were within a few minutes walk and Chip gave us some good ideas were to go. The house was very clean and comfortable. A really great touch was the snacks and soft drinks that were left for us. Due to a delayed flight we did not get in until late, so the drinks and snacks were greatly appreciated.
I always feel the measure of staying somewhere is how long it takes you to feel at home and get a good nights sleep and here we felt at home almost immediately. I have been to Madisonville on multiple occasions and this is one of the best places I have stayed at. We were here for 8 nights and I will definitely try and stay here again when I am next back"

Olivia & Chip created a welcoming ambience which made our holiday amazing! We felt right at home, and when away from our home for Christmas, that was so very important to us. Madisonville is in the top ten of towns in Kentucky to visit for Christmas according to a statewide publication, and so this house was the perfect destination for Christmas. This stay is now a treasured holiday memory."

Stayed a few nights","The hosts were incredible and very responsive. The kitchen was stocked with snacks and drinks, which was appreciated after a long drive.
The neighborhood is within walking distance to a quaint downtown area. The porch has a swing that I hope to use next time I visit.
It was Christmas season and it was nice and cozy sitting at their dining room table watching the horse and carriage decorated with Christmas lights pass in front of the house. the shutters on the old windows make creates a cozy and homey environment.
Large dining room made a perfect place for me to work daily. The wifi was excellent.
The hosts checked in a few times and even invited input for anything that would have made my stay better.
I use airBNbs frequently and this is one of my favorites of all times.
Thank you for an incredible place to take care of affairs for family."

I needed a place where I could be reflective and relax. This place fit the bill.
I was apprehensive about the outside shower. There is actually nothing to be apprehensive about, probably one of the coolest things at the caboose!
My last day, was up early enough and got to watch the sunrise through the trees while I was showering!
How many people can say that?
I'm also a train fan, so staying in the Caboose made me like a kid again!
If you're on the fence whether to book this place, jump off the fence and just do it!"

the place was super cool, very well done. spotlessly clean especially for a farm type stay! everything you need is there, tv for streaming, bluetooth audio to listen to inside and out while relaxing on the big deck. serene pond with fountain right in front of you, comfy couch for watching your streaming shows, really comfy bed as well. super responsive too, i asked a question and got a reply within 2 minutes..i mean QUICK. it was nice to grill and enjoy the patio. both heat and ac worked great. was nice sitting in the top part of the train car and drinking (provided) coffee while looking out the windows..and ill admit i was a littlle nervous about an outdoor shower, but DANG it was nice! a sitting area for your clothes and such, a heater in the shower area if its cold, and 2 big shower heads with ample hot water.. very well laid out.
i would give it 10 stars if i could"

I contacted the owner and didn’t get a reply. My dog ended up finding the nest (not a fun experience), I got stung by a wasp and my boyfriend went to the store to get wasp spray to kill the nest."

The air conditioning worked very well, and everything was very well designed. The outdoor shower is incredible! My husband was a bit apprehensive about it, but ended up loving it.

Out of all the Air B&B places I have been to, this is definitely my top choice to return to! Was a little nervous about the outside shower at first but, don’t let it be your deciding factor in not coming here because it was the best part of this adorable place!"

The hammock was a bit worn out and sagged but was still nice. The grass was tall, but it’s a farm. There aren’t any photos but the bathroom (toilet) is plenty spacious. The coffee bar was stocked with 3 different coffee K cups. TV has roku, but we didn’t use it. WiFi worked well. Outdoor speakers were a nice touch. The shower with IR Heater was definitely interesting. Bed was super comfortable. Plenty of natural light to wake you in the morning. There isn’t anything super close (stores, restaurants) but just a short drive. Really enjoyed our stay here."

Communication with owner fantastic, caboose well-designed and decorated, used indoor/outdoor blue-tooth speaker to listen to online instruction for yoga flow on the deck nearby the fountain pond, outdoor shower with visible train undercarriage and tracks neat, sofa super comfy while watching a movie, kitchen well-equipped, flush toilet, upper deck of caboose with sitting area nice for reading, bed super comfy with nice linens, appreciated that the caboose was warm at night. I don’t normally like to stay in places more than once because I feel there is so much to see and experience but this place is worth a repeat visit in the future. I highly recommend!"

This time around hotels were booked up so I stumbled upon this listing. This is easily the nicest Airbnb in the area. I enjoyed my time there, built a nice fire in the firepit, door-dashed some dinner. I could spend a week here and really enjoy the place. Nikki also breeds goldendoodles so there are puppies and dogs nearby - that's a perk for me. I love a doggo.

Stayed one night","My wife and I were in town for a show at the college. This was a great alternative to downtown Madisonville. In the countryside, beautiful and quiet yet easy access to town. The place is brand new and really nice. Still a few finishing details yet to be completed but in no way detracted from the overall experience. Nikki was friendly and helpful. Would definitely return."

The house was so nice and clean and had everything we needed for our stay. It was in a great location and very nice community. We will definitely be staying here again!!"

We were in town on a work trip, only planning on a days work. After the job ending up being much more than intended we were left without a place to sleep,shower ect. I sent the host a message and received a response within 5 mins. It was an incredible experience throughout the whole process. I hope to visit again at some point! Maybe not work related lol"

Plenty of room for us all to have our own space; especially loved the classic details (carriage house bedroom, working vintage doorbell, original doors / floors, hardware etc.). If you love old houses you'll love this place. If you are a light sleeper, I would suggest earplugs as the train passes close by several times a day & night. Loved the walking distance / short drive to multiple restaurants in town, and always felt safe. Ronald was very friendly and responsive in all communications. We will definitely reserve again for next year!"

Stayed with kids","We had an incredible weekend retreat at this beautiful historical home in downtown Madisonville, Kentucky. The house has been lovingly remodeled, seamlessly blending historical charm with modern amenities.
Our large family, including adult children and grandchildren, stayed comfortably in the spacious suites, each with its own private bathroom, huge television, and mini kitchen area. The common area, comprising a well-equipped kitchen, living room, and laundry area, served as the perfect gathering spot for our family.
Ronald, our host, went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. His simple instructions made check-in a breeze, and the thoughtful touches like a basket stocked with coffee, laundry pods, popcorn, and hot chocolate added an extra layer of warmth to our experience.
The rental was immaculately clean, and the attention to detail was evident both inside and out. We appreciated the privacy of the locking bedrooms and felt completely at home throughout our stay."

We had Christmas gift opening in the parlor, Like we lived there! Even took a Christmas picture of our family on the staircase. All of us could stay together. Close family could visit and we were close to visit them. The night we arrived we were later than expected and they were so caring and considerate to turn on lights in the house for us so we didn’t enter in the dark. Response to our texts were immediate. We even got an extra tour of the whole house by Rick! Joann, Carol, Rick and Ronald love this gem of a house as did we! We would definitely stay again when in town."

The decor was vintage mixed with high style. This property has many rooms that are all separate which makes for a good stay if you want privacy. There are also a couple of small gathering places that are very nice for sitting and talking. Each room has it's own special flare especially the room that used to be a carriage house (!). Barry and Sharon are extremely friendly and responsive to needs you have.

The beds are extremely comfortable and the sheets were really high quality. We were impressed. We never found a single thing the place lacked for the entire week. We are already planning another stay here next year. If you are considering staying here, make a reservation with confidence. Penelope is a perfect host."

Lovely home, very spacious. Kitchen has everything you need to eat in for the time you are there. Penelope was very friendly and easy to talk to. Great value- enjoyed our stay."

Stayed about a week","The place was lovely and clean and in a very good location. You was just far enough away from the centre of town for it to be away from the busy parts, but only a short distance away from all the shops and facilities.
The house was just what we needed and had ample space. The bathroom and kitchen were modernised (recently by the looks of it) and had all what you needed to have a comfortable stay.
I always judge a place on how it makes me feel at home and normally it takes a few days to feel that way and get acclimatised. However, in this place I felt at home straight away and slept well from the very first night.
Penelope was brilliant and very quick at answering any questions I had but also let us keep to ourselves. I would however have liked to thank her personally for her help and for hosting a great place to stay.
if I am in the area again, I will definitely try and stay there again and would highly recommend it to others."

She was very easy to work out details with us and brought extra supplies for the extended stay. If ever the time comes I need to go again, I would definitely see if this place is available.

The home had everything we needed. The beds are comfortable. There’s a fire pit and chairs in the back yard, but we didn’t have time to use them. We were in town for a wedding and were so happy we’d chosen this home. It’s just 10 minutes from a beautiful park (& wedding venue). I can stress enough how impressed I was with the cleanliness. The linens smelled fresh and not a spot of dust or dirt anywhere! We hope to have the opportunity to return."

Stayed one night","This was our first BNB and we didn't know what to expect, but everything was awesome, great communication. Dogs were amazing, we have dogs at home and felt very comfortable with them. They do follow your car, which made me nervous but they stay out of the way. The wifi was better then expected in the cabin. The porch area was nice for me and my wife to sit and drink wine listening to the woods, you don't really hear cars or the general bustle of being in town. The little trail is nice, it's marked with blue flags, and there is a cemetery but it's very overgrown, it's a century old and you can tell, very interesting to look at the history of the land. Closest gas station is 4 miles away so to us it's a perfect little hidden getaway that's private and still close to civilization. Would love to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Great place! Nice hosts! If you're looking for a nice bit of solitude and you don't want or need all the accommodations and comforts of home, this is a great get away. It was more set up for a single individual. The bed was big and there appeared to be a twin mattress under the bed, but there was one big comfy chair and a small wooden chair. It would have been fine if the weather would have been more accommodating. The outdoor space looked cozy and would have been nice if there had been a fireplace to snuggle up next to or something. The cottage was very small. There's not really enough room for a table and chairs or a couch or even another comfy chair probably... which, I wouldn't have minded had I been a bit more mentally prepared for it. Nice place! It would be perfect for a hunter, a writer, an artist, someone wanting to just get away for a little peace and quiet. It is a very clean and well decorated room with a small bathroom, sink, mini- fridge and microwave"

Stayed one night","This is a lovely well-constructed little cabin in a wooded setting. I only stayed overnight, but it would have been a nice place to stay longer. The wifi signal seemed very weak, but that may be because it was raining. It was clear a lot of love had been put into the place based on the decor including some crosses and such. Based on the guest book, people had really enjoyed visiting with Larry and Rebecca.
Larry showed me around when I got there. He assured me that I would be safe because everyone knew that everyone carried guns there, so there was no crime. The place is small and modest, but had everything I needed. It was very quiet except for the sound of rain on the roof, which I enjoyed. I slept well in the large comfy bed."

Stayed a few nights","What a sweet little cabin getaway. Perfect for a couple or single traveler like myself. The kitchen is tiny but you can make coffee, keep your groceries cold and the spacious deck has a grill. There are no restaurants nearby so you’ll need to arrive with food but that is why I loved the location so much. Very private, rural and you’re up against wild forests. The view from your porch is all trees. The owners are nearby but they are respectful of your privacy and yet friendly. Perfect combo. You’ll be greeted by the sweetest dogs but one is a little jumpy. I didn’t mind and actually chose this place because I love dogs. They can’t access your porch so they were no bother and did a good job protecting the place at night. My only slight complaint is there is some light that gets through the windows if the motion sensor lights come on outside in the night. If you are sensitive to light in the room I would bring a sleep mask. The bed is comfortable and the place is clean and peaceful."

Stayed a few nights","This is a one-room facility. The kitchen is on the patio outside. If you have long legs, you will not be closing the door to the bathroom. I choose Airbnb and Vrbo's over hotels so I can use the kitchen to make our meals. I would not go outside in 40-degree weather to try and make breakfast. My biggest pet peeve with these locations is only one towel and one washcloth per person for your stay. I use a clean washcloth every day when I wash my face. It was a very secluded location and very peaceful. We did not have the opportunity to enjoy the area. We were in town to help with closing the estate of my mother-in-law. Add more towels and more toilet paper. It would be a better option."

It was a little bit too small as there was only one comfortable chair to sit in, and no kitchen table. However, there is a very nice deck/porch with a nice kitchen table and swing and a comfortable chair. But it was very warm outside and we couldn't make much use of it. The place was clean, but it seemed a bit run down. After 500 guests or so, the rugs were very worn."

Stayed one night","The cabin was the perfect size for a night away with my partner! We loved walking the trail around the property (make sure you're familiar with poison ivy, oak, and sumac if you intend to do so! Also, use bug spray and check for ticks when you get back; boots not strictly necessary, but tall socks recommended), and wish we'd budgeted more time to spend on the beautiful deck. The dogs are wonderfully sweet, although their property protecting diligence changed my plans of sleeping with just the screen door closed, and I unfortunately missed Larry's message asking about our arrival time so he could make sure they wouldn't worry us when they came up to greet the car. Additionally, I use a more supportive pillow at home, and would have been better suited to bring it with me, but the cabin is fully outfitted with extra linens, & hosts live on-site should you *need* anything.
Overall, it's a very relaxing and safe space, facilitated by kind, respectful hosts!"

Stayed with kids","Upon arrival Rebecca and Larry greeted us. They were so sweet and I could talk to them for hours. They showed us around and let us know if we needed anything to let them know. I felt very safe there thanks to them. I’m scared of the dark so knowing they were right next door was a huge bonus for me.
I am a pet lover so I didn’t mind the dogs at all. If I remember correctly it’s Rekk and Axel. They roam the property but aren’t allowed inside the porch of the cabin. Axel does jump and he is a large dog but when I told him to get down, he did so! My husband on the other hand isn’t an animal lover so he didn’t enjoy them as my son and I did.
The cabin was very clean and the perfect size for the 3 of us!
Thank you Rebecca and Larry!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the PERFECT getaway that we were looking for. The space inside was very clean and very cozy. The beautiful deck outside with the swing, table and big comfy chair backed up to the woods was the perfect place to drink our morning coffee and enjoy the sun going down. The trail on the property was beautiful and a peaceful way to end our last evening there. The hosts were extremely kind and responsive to any questions I had. There isn’t streaming but they do have DirecTv with all of the channels so when it’s dark out and you’re ready to unwind for bed you can watch your favorite shows. I felt very safe with their two pups keeping guard through out the night and loved getting to give them pets on the way in and out. Overall one of the absolute best airbnbs and SUCH great value for money. We will be back again and again!"

Only reason I didn’t give 5 starts is one of the dogs jumped on my new car and ate some of our dinner we were roasting by the fire. Other then that, it was a great stay!"

It was a bit to cool & rainy while I stayed, otherwise could have gone for walks right from the cabin deck or sat out on the swing. Host was always responsive & helpful! Comfortable king bed. I would have literally loved to have loaded up the leather chair to take home with me. Truly a cozy & clean space to relax for 3 days. I would definitely return & recommend if you like nature, privacy & are ok with smaller bathroom and partial kitchen amenities!!! Drove 15-20 minutes to pick up a few groceries, otherwise everything I needed was in the cabin. There was the occasional barking of their dogs but this didn’t bother me."

Stayed one night","The cabin is just as described. Peaceful and quiet except for dogs barking. Larry met us when we arrived and showed us around.
All of the other reviews are very accurate however I would like to add somethings.
The door doesn’t lock to the cabin (you are in the middle of nowhere but would feel better if it locked).
The bathroom door doesn’t stay shut. The curtains on the windows don’t seem to be enough to have privacy as the owners home is right next to the cabin.
The dogs are sweet but they do jump. They are not small dogs they were taller than me when they would jump up. I feel like the owners could corral the dogs when guest are arriving (we were in communication when we would be arriving and were met when we pulled up).
Other than that the cabin is a great place to getaway."

Stayed a few nights","The stay was odd. Larry greeted us immediately and showed us around and told us about ""local"" attractions. Very kind. There was no wifi on the property that we could access so we had to use our 1 bar cell signal to look them up, only to find out they were mostly 1 to 2 hours away. That's ok because we really just wanted a quiet weekend.
There is a small town about 25 minutes away with a couple restaurants and bars and several Family Dollars within 15 minutes. There was also a winery up the road, 35 minutes, with delicious food and decent wine. There isn't much hiking nearby.
The building you stay in is a studio. It's 'cozy' and the bathroom walls don't go to the ceiling. The barn door on the bathroom doesn't stay shut and your knees will touch when on the toilet. The back deck is the same square footage as the cabin and an overall nice area. Unfortunately there isn't much privacy. Most seats are in view of the owner's kitchen and public areas. Also, there is no way to lock the cabin when you leave for the day.
The dogs are both very friendly and sweet. However, they are large and one will jump on you and pee on your car. My back got scratched and my tires were marked each morning. They also stay outside at night and woke us up 3 times over 2 nights.
The breakfast advertised is a delicious muffin. It's not really breakfast, but I'm not mad; it was clutch.
What else... There's a very short walking trail that leads to a very old, 1800s graveyard and there's fresh sod in the back (we saw and heard it being put in Saturday morning). I found a roach in the sink, but you are in the woods...
We won't be back, but if you need a few days of relative quiet and solitude, go for it!"

Upon entering, we found the cabin to be immediately appealing, in its design, decor and cleanliness. The bed is very comfortable, and the space is small but well organized, with a kitchen counter and small sink, fridge and microwave. Indoor cooking is with an electric skillet and microwave. There are grills for outdoor cooking. The tiny bathroom has a very nice shower. Instead of a bathroom sink, the kitchen sink is utilized. The hosts are very friendly and responsive. The dogs are friendly too! (but may disturb your sleep a little as they keep watch in the night).

I loved knowing we never felt alone and seeing their precious faces so happy to see us. The cabin has a tv, basic necessities (silverware, microwave, skillet, refrigerator, toilet paper, towels, soap, ect). We were so happy to see they had stand up desks to eat on! BIG PLUS. There is darts that were fun to play with. Hosts were awesome and even gave us delicious homemade muffins and popcorn. Very attentive! Highly recommend. We will be planning on returning in the summer."

Stayed a few nights","Becki and Larry are so kind and friendly! They made sure we had everything we needed and then some. The space is perfect for two people who are comfortable with each other in close quarters. The dogs were so excited to meet and greet us with wagging tails and excited barks as we pulled in (and anytime we stepped out the door, which was more than welcome). We brought our own electric stovetop but they did have an electric pan so you’re set for winter cooking. All in all it’s a great cabin with all the cozy fix-ins you could need."

The covered back porch would have been great to use except it was too cold outside. The only issue we have with the listing is that it says there is an indoor fireplace, but there was only a small electric heater made to look like a fireplace. Otherwise, it is a wonderful place to stay."

I'm a little afraid of dogs and Larry was very kind about taking them in when I was loading and unloading. Driveway was a bit steep but was okay to handle even in a cargo van full of all my earthly possessions. :) One thing I didn't expect is that there was no sink in the bathroom but was able to use the kitchen sink. Shower was good and had a great night's sleep. I was unable to log in to WIFI and had spotty cell phone service--depended where I was in the cabin but maybe my service? Overall, this was a great place to stay with very kind hosts and would recommend."

If you want to see stars at night around a campfire (free wood to collect on her acres) and see deer in the yard in the morning, then this is the place for you. The host, Marie, was very responsive both before and after our trip, answering all of our questions, and even offering to purchase a Crock-Pot and get it to the cabin for us when asked if it had one! Thank you Marie. We had a wonderful beef stew in the Crock-Pot one night. We had a wonderful time and would definitely use it again if in the area. The Land of Lakes and the Elk and Bison Preserve is only an hour away and a wonderful place to explore for a day."

Stayed with kids","Best B&B ever! We had both felt at home from the minute we entered. Everything, clean and in its place, updates furnishings and the photos told the story of this house very well. We loved the local pictures and books telling the history of the town very interesting. The beds were way comfortable and the fire pit out back was amazing! This house took all of the simplicity of country living and gave it a modern touch. I slept like a baby and did not want to leave. Thank you all for an amazing place to spend a couple days in and hope to visit this home again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","I usually don’t leave reviews, but this place deserved one. The house was spotless clean and in a peaceful location with beautiful views. Mr Harold stopped by and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay and made us feel right at home. The house is in an awesome location with a wal mart and several restaurants minutes away. I plan on returning next hunting season and I will definitely be staying there if available."
