Stayed a few nights","We loved this home. We booked through Evolve but the owners is what made this place amazing. This review is about the owners and the space. It was a gorgeous home on the mountain side with gorgeous views. The home was very beautifully decorated and the owners thought of everything. The beds are comfy, fluffy towels, nice open kitchen to cook meals. There was games to play in the living room, comfy couches, and blankets galore. The owners were so nice and friendly. We met him outside daily. We heard all about him and his family which made us fall in love with the place even more. I probably shouldn’t be letting everyone know about this amazing gem, but if you’re still reading, book it. We will definitely return in the future soon. It’s the perfect get away to take with family or just for couples."

Stayed one night",Mary’s home lived up to all of my expectations and previous 5 star ratings. She and her home were welcoming and friendly. I felt like it was home away from home. Beautifully decorated and very clean. I even took notes on ideas for my own home. She had everything anyone would need and more. My only regret was not being able to stay longer. I highly recommend Mary’s dreamy beach home and will come back for another visit if I can! So very grateful for the experience! Thank you Mary!!!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Mary's tiny home was absolutely delightful! Mary's hospitality was superb from start to finish. She ensured we had a smooth check-in process and checked in on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. It truly felt like a home away from home. The tiny house was impressively well-equipped for all our needs, whether it was cooking, sleeping, watching movies, or just unwinding and relaxing. Mary's attention to detail and care for her guests truly sets her apart. We can't recommend her tiny home enough!
From the Minnesota Crew…

Stayed a few nights","The pictures and video showed The Beach House perfectly. It was cozy and so comfortable. The bed was so snuggie. We had everything we needed and more. We enjoyed coming back after looking at all the tiny house models and actually being in the space to see what it would feel like to live in a tiny house.
We enjoyed having TV channels we don't normally get like Tiny House Nation.
Plenty of hot water and even giant ice cubes in the freezer.
There was a bench outside in front, we might have sat outside if there had been some shade but we really weren't there much. It was a wonderful comfy place to come back to after our outings to Gatlinburg and surrounding areas."

Stayed a few nights","I have been thinking about downsizing to a tiny house. I wanted to try one out and I found this gem after a few searches.
G maps did a decent job getting me there but actually stopped a couple of spots short. Mary's instructions were much better.
Everything was clean and comfortable! Brochures and restaurant names were available, even a handwritten notebook of eating establishments. I didn't use but coffee, filtered water, and ice were provided.
It's close enough to Pigeon Forge so consider this place instead of a hotel. You won't be disappointed. Plus on the drive to PF, you can stop off at Bush Bean Museum/factory.
Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","This Tiny House stay...in a word..
AMAZING! From first contact with Mary to our stay in her Incredible Tiny Home. I've stayed at 5 star hotels that weren't as clean or quiet as Marys.
She was super helpful and she let us check in early and we didn't even ask. We actually paid more for our dinner than we did for a 1 nites stay at her place. Most places don't offer only 1 nites stay so I appreciated that.
Her basket of dining and attractions were super helpful. Thank you Mary we'll be back"

It is instantly apparent that this space is loved.
The decor transports you to a peaceful oasis... beautiful seaside decor, soothing colors, every detail is perfect.
We felt at ease and very comfortable in their home.
For a tiny home, it feels spacious and very well thought out.
Very comfy queen bed, good towels, soft sheets.
Well appointed kitchen, and bath has spa like toiletries.
we will definitely stay again if we pass this way.

Stayed one night","Not to be dramatic but I think this is the nicest AirBnB I have ever stayed in. The tiny home itself is adorable and super easy to find, using Mary’s instructions. Once you enter the unit you can see just how much love Mary has put into it, as she thought of every little thing you might you might wonder about. The bed is very comfortable and it surprisingly does not get too hot up in the loft. I would say if you are over 5’10 you might have some trouble getting into the bed but for us, it was perfect. Book this place immediately if you’re in the area. I promise it’s worth it."

It was definitely a small sleeping space and next time would probably sleep on the pull out sofa. Not ideal when you need to use the restroom in the middle of the night."

We plan to stay here many more times this year and beyond, the house was very clean, It had everything we needed, tv channels are not real clear but Mary has a smart tv and a blue ray player, she also supplied movies so we never went without tv. If you stay here set up a tour with Twila from incredible tiny homes it’s well worth it. Feel free to walk around the entire property and talk with the residents they are all down to earth people and they can help answer any questions you may have, we even had some residents show us inside their home great place to meet new friends."

It is apparent that Mary has put considerable thought into what a guest might want or need from coffee and tea, to popcorn, movies, and games, to hooks by the door and in the bathroom, and so much more. The soft blue-green, white, and gray palette, along with all the beachy decor makes it feel like the tiny is right on the ocean with the waves lapping up on the shore. Adding a sound machine could make it all the more convincing. :) It was nice to have the electric fireplace after the high 70s day turned into a low 40s night. The people I met from the community were warm and welcoming. I'm looking forward to staying again!"

It was a pleasure to stay with Mara Lee and her wonderful tiny home in the forest!"

When I told her I couldn’t locate it because the address wouldn’t show up on gps AND it didn’t match the website. She was very rude. That is the only bad thing about the place. That’s the only reason I will not be returning.

Stayed with kids","First and foremost, this place has an unmatched vibe. Retro, yet close enough to everything to know you are still in 2024. The gas pumps and the signage are so cool to just admire, let alone realize they actually work.
There is so much that reminds you of how gas stations used to be laid out. You could almost feel where the back office was, where the counter was, where little snacks were sold. The bed was soft as could be, and the lighting was retro, but modern with vintage bulbs.
Piece of advice for those who like to wander at night: There is a bathroom inside the bathroom, so make sure you turn the lights on! If you go to the larger of the two and take a premature right coming out, you end up in the other bathroom thinking it's the Twilight Zone."

The Texaco Station was a comfortable blast of Americana coupled with relaxed ""antiquing."" Pam's husband greeted us as we pulled in and there was ample instructions inside. My favorite spot on the property was the ""store front"" rocking chairs - fun to sit and chat by the light of the renovated ""gas pumps."" (This is NOT a working fuel station - just a memorial to the central role these little stations played long before the mega gas marts took over. We would definitely stay here again!"

Pam's place was super easy to find. just far enough out of the tourists area to make your stay peaceful and relaxing, but close enough to the tourist area when you want or need to go into that part of town. Pam was a gracious host, who thinks of everything you might need from preparing morning coffee to a relaxing evening shower, and everything in between. Everything was so CLEAN and you can tell she takes pride in providing her guests a great experience.
She left us a map with how to get down some local streets to bypass some of the tourist traffic, local recommendations on places to eat, and pamphlets of things to do.
The place was beautiful and we enjoyed our stay so much! DEFINITELY recommend Pam's place if you're looking for a quieter homey feeling for your next Vacation!"

It clearly was created out of love, which you can feel in every room. There is a tremendous sense of fun that can underlie one's entire vacation experience if you let it.
We were also thrilled with the location. The ""neighborhood"" is quiet and serene and was central to our needs throughout East Tennessee.
Pam is a delightful host, too. She gave us our privacy while making it clear that she was always there if we needed her.
We are so thankful for the experience."

The little touches left by Pam were a perfect illustration of how she really cares for her guests and wants them to have the absolute best time possible during their stay. The prefilled ice trays, variety of coffees, teas and cereal bars were a wonderful surprise on our first morning getting ready for a full day of exploring. The bathroom was immaculate and fully stocked with all of the fresh crisp towels and wash cloths you could dream of. I found myself more than once getting lost in the nostalgia on the way to or from the bathroom or bedroom. It was very sweet to take so many trips down memory lane to Mamaw's kitchen looking at the little trinkets. Highly recommend the place for the tranquility and the outstanding hospitality!"

We didn’t want to leave because the location was perfect and it felt like home the moment we walked in.

The interior is absolutely one of a kind depicting an early to mid 1900’s setting . All the appliances and housewares compliment the interior and work perfectly. The gas pumps in front actually light up for nighttime viewing!

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the most unique and hospitable airbnb’s we have stayed in. Pam’s place is both comfortable and fun. The listing is very convenient, close to the highway, to several delicious restaurants and to Walmart. It’s quiet throughout the day and night. It was very clean despite all the nooks and crannies of an older home. It was easy to maintain the temperature we wanted. The Wi-Fi was strong. The home is roomy for the two of us and we enjoyed listening to birds with our coffee on the patio. Good water pressure, plenty of hot water and a good shower. The main bathroom is large and it’s convenient to have a second bathroom with toilet and sink. The king size bed is firm and comfortable. The home is entertaining, filled with treasures on every surface; the floors, counters, drawers and shelves. The hostess, Pam, was exceptionally nice and readily available. It was a good way to experience the warmth and beauty of eastern Tennessee."

We stayed two nights, and I honestly never stopped discovering new things around the station. I could stay there forever. The Amish store is fantastic. The kitchen and bathroom have every essential you could possibly need and plenty of extras, too. The bed is super comfy. Everything was spectacularly clean, with little notes and directions tucked in here and there, all around. Pam’s eye for design and style is woven perfectly into the old school vibe of this location. Her hospitality and bubbly personality made us feel so welcome. Anyone traveling through the Smoky Mountains who wants a true taste of the vintage lifestyle should make this spot a MUST SEE!"

Loved spending time enjoying all the antiques on display in the property. Just browsing the collection will give you plenty to do. I’d recommend maybe not staying here if you have toddlers. Lots for them to get into. 😁 For adults and older kids, quite a cool experience!
It’s a solid 30 minute drive to Pigeon Forge (which we traveled to daily) - but you’ll find all the stores you need minutes away.
So happy we picked this AirBNB for our stay in the area."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at this renovated 1950’s Texaco station. Everything was perfect! We liked the location. It was convenient to the interstate but, just far away enough from the hustle and bustle of Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area when you were tired of dealing with people and traffic. It was a great, unique place to stay. Pam was a great host. She had great communication and great tips of what to see and where to eat. We will definitely be back!"

Pam is the nicest host we have ever encountered. The place was fabulous and we enjoyed our stay so much. Several days in, the cold killed our car battery. Pam and her husband came to look at it and even drive my husband to a parts store to get a new battery. These hosts are true and genuine and I can not wait to see them again. Thank you all so much for the wonderful stay and for showing my family and I that good and genuine people still exist. U til next time, friend."

Stayed a few nights","I wanted to take my wife on a cabin getaway weekend, but I came across the station and it was just so unique and cool, I thought my wife would find it a really one of a kind experience and she did. I loved that the place had its own character, it was secluded enough for the proper amount of privacy we wanted and it had a great view of English Mountain. Upon booking, I immediately felt secure I made the right choice, as Pam contacted me to introduce herself. She’s such a genuinely nice person. I live and work in the tourist capital of America and it’s still hard to find that kind of authentic hospitality in a host. The place is so spacious, bigger than our first apartment in Brooklyn, NY before we moved to FL. The kitchen and dining area has a 50’s feel but contains all the comforts and tools of a modern kitchen. Pam gave us great dinner recommendations, however, so we only had breakfast at the station. The living area has a nice vintage feel with a mix of antique decor and items and the bedroom is comfortable with a small virtual fireplace and plenty of pillow choices to choose your preferred level of comfort. There is a wall of shelves, I’m told original to the station for storing car parts for repairs, running from the living room past the bedroom that contains antique items for purchase, which was great for us to grab a few souvenirs to remind us of the stay. The bathroom contains a huge full bath and a separate half bath which is convenient. Pam and her husband live in a house right behind the station which could be helpful as they were quick to offer themselves for any services you needed or even help in case of emergencies, like car issues, etc. I also had a great time playing with sarge and his toy chicken, if you know, you know. Overall I will definitely stay here again and look forward to introducing other members of our family to this blast from the past!"

Stayed a few nights","We took a girls trip to the Texaco Station; my 85 year old mother and my 2 sisters. When we arrived there was peanut butter, jelly and a loaf of bread (among other snacks) in the fridge and cupboard. We were so happy to eat a PB&J sandwich because none of us wanted to go out to eat. We were tired from the long drive. Pam, the host, left us a note telling us sights we might enjoy and places to eat. The four of us felt completely safe and enjoyed the privacy and quiet. The place was more spacious than I expected from looking at the pictures on AirBNB. We sat in the front rocking chairs every morning and evening enjoying the view of English Mt. Pam couldn’t have been any more friendly and helpful. With any text I sent her, I got a quick response. I highly recommend this place. Especially if you want to be away from cities and appreciate the restoration of an old building."

I never thought a gas station could feel so cozy but Pam and Tony have done an amazing job transforming it. It felt like home away from home. You have your very own antique gift shop inside! The whole place was nice and clean and the bed was so comfy. Away from all the crazy but close enough to still go. About 35 minutes from Pigeon Forge. These hosts are so sweet and helpful and responded almost instantly to any questions I had. Also left a list of suggestions for local places that was really nice. I messaged Pam to see what pizza place delivered bc I was having trouble finding one and they were coming by a Little Caesars so they picked one up for us and brought it by! Such a nice couple that made us feel even more at home than their place did. We will definitely be back and we can’t wait! Thanks so much! :)

The space was clean and there was plenty of room to spread out. You will enjoy things like a Sears catalog dated 1900 in the bathroom! Self check in and out was a breeze. Located right along a road so there was some road noise but it was expected and not bad at all. We didn’t get to use the grill or air hockey table, maybe next time! The kitchen was well stocked with pans/utensils for any meals you would want to cook."

There were separate spaces for dining/games/work, relaxing /TV and sleeping. The double dormer, full stand up loft bedroom was open and spacious.

A very well appointed inside kitchen and outdoor grilling area.
The yard was amazing, full of flowers and greenery with many seating options. Unfortunately the weather didn't allow us to spend as much time outside as we'd like to.
We made meals here most nights and there was everything we needed from utensils to storage containers and cleaning supplies.
Simple, clean, homey decor.
Pet friendly was definitely a plus that allowed us to vacation with our dog.
Tiny Towne is conducive to leisurely walks at any time and neighbors are friendly.
Convenient location to tourist towns, recreation areas. and highways to get you anywhere.
It rained a ton when we visited and we felt comfortable being in the tiny for extended periods of time.
We will book again for our next trip."

Stayed with a pet","This tiny house is located in the Forest community at Tiny Town. This was my first time using the AirBB app & I missed the instr on opening the lock (digital), but I was asst quickly and entered into this adorable tiny home.
In the largest tiny home community (Incredible Tiny Homes) across the USA, this home is located in the Forest.
This community is located in what I call….an enchanted forest. The tiny homes are nestled within trees and natural greenery.
The bed is located in the loft, which allows you to completely stand up. It was a nice surprise, but I found that I personally, discovered going down the stairs was a bit unsettling for me. So I grabbed a pillow and hit the sofa! The throw on the sofa feels like a cloud, so falling asleep was easy!
hearing little taps of rain drops hitting the metal roof was so much better than my sound bar. Totally awesome!!!
The residents of this community have relocated from across the nation & elsewhere. All are friendly &welcoming"

Unfortunately I only got to sleep in the cabin one night as I ended up being taken by ambulance to one of the heart hospitals in Knoxville on our 2nd day in the area. But, it was comforting to me to know that my wife and children had a safe, comfortable place to stay while I was an hour away.
The cabin is clean and comfortable, the grounds are beautiful, and my wife told me that the checkout process was extremely easy (which I'm grateful for since I wasn't there to help her check out). Thank you again Andrew and we look forward to staying at the Moonshine Cabin again!"

We were about an hour away from the GSMNP (which is where we spent most of our time), but we were glad to stay at a place that felt secluded and private when we came home. We had a fire pit, grill, and honestly a huge area all to ourselves. There were ants in the cabin, however Andrew let us know beforehand and also was able to get the exterminator to the home the next morning (within 12 hours of me messaging him) which was great. I highly recommend! - especially if you have a decent sized party that doesn't need some of the fancier perks you get with the cabins near Gatlinburg. Since we spent most of our day exploring outdoors, this place met all of our needs."

I literally found nothing that I didn't like! Host was very responsive and so nice. He communicated very well and answered any questions I had. He truly went above and beyond. Now nobody book this place cause we're coming again soon and I won't stay anywhere else!! 😁"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I rented this cabin for her birthday weekend and the cabin was perfect. The cabin is located in Newport roughly 25-35 minutes away from downtown Gatlinburg, TN. The cabin is close to I-40 Interstate which makes it easy for you to exit TN when it's time to leave. The cabin is also located next to a stream and has a big front and back yard for outdoor activities. Lastly, the cabin is newly remodeled and was very clean.
Mr. Andrew was very helpful and responded to all my messages in a timely manner. He also allowed us to check in early even though our check-in was scheduled for 4:00 PM. Furthermore, I recommend this cabin to any family of 4 or for a couples weekend getaway."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay in this cabin! It was well-furnished, clean, and cozy yet still roomy. It's in a very quiet and private location and is an easy, scenic drive to downtown Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. We had a great time exploring the area, but always found ourselves looking forward to going ""home"" to the cabin in the evenings to cook, watch movies, and relax. Both beds were very comfortable, water pressure was great in both showers, and the internet was lighting fast. Andrew was very responsive and gave us a ton of suggestions of things to do in the area. We highly recommend this cabin if you're looking for a beautiful, peaceful getaway that is also close to countless hikes and activities. We hope to be back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Andrew was a fantastic host, VERY responsive, and the cabin is just adorable inside! Great selection and quality of finishes, furnishings and kitchen equipment. Super easy access off interstate and all easy, well maintained roads to the property with no hill challenges which is unusual in this area. Fantastic hiking with the Appalachian trail about 10 minutes up
I-40, plus tons of other trails. If you’re a fan of walking through suburb developments, then this may be a bit too rural for you - the road to the cabin doesn’t have building restrictions so you’ll pass trailers/trailer park. We had no issues though, so don’t judge a book by it’s cover. The property itself is quite nice and peaceful and the cabin, beds and couches super clean and comfy!"

The cabin in the woods is exactly what it sounds like, very sweet cabin, with a forested backyard, still close to the interstate but fairy quiet . Inside is a nice and tastefully decorated cabin, with 2 full bathrooms and 2 full beds, both very comfortable and a nice size kitchen, good parking, washer, dryer, and very fast internet. The cabin has everything you need to enjoy a comfy stay while you travel about checking out Gatlinburg and the Smokey Mountains!"

Beautiful, idyllic location, extremely comfortable space, and sparkling clean, this is one of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had (and we stay in them a lot).
Susan’s guest home is perfect for couples and convenient to nearby destinations. Because of dietary restrictions, I cook most of my own meals. Her kitchen was well-stocked, and she included extra towels, blankets, pillows, and throws throughout the rest of the home. It truly was a home away from home during our stay. Thank you, Susan, for such a comfortable, welcoming, gracious space! We will return when we can."

It was very clean, and even more spacious that I thought it would be. The sunset and sunrise views are absolutely gorgeous, and the swing chair out front gave the perfect view. It's worth noting that there are a few neighbors with outdoor dogs that love to bark, which can be a bit of a damper on the breathtaking views. I'd highly recommend the space, it had everything I needed and was very cozy."

Stayed a few nights","First I want to start with saying, you have to book this place. Susan’s guesthouse is absolutely everything you need to enjoy your trip in Tennessee. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed by Susan. The view her guesthouse provides, is out of this world. Me and my boyfriend got to see the sunrise over the Smoky Mountains early in the morning, & even got to see the stars on her swinging bench at night. My boyfriend and I spent most of our time hiking, and exploring downtown Gatlinburg. When we were ready to go back to Susan’s Guesthouse, we would always refer to it as “we are going home.”
Because that is exactly how it felt like, we felt so comfortable and we can’t wait to come back in the future."

Next, I would like to say that the bathroom seemed not to be cleaned throughly — there was hair (not ours) on the shower wall and the toilet seat was soiled with a bodily fluids. Susan had cleaning solutions there so I cleaned it up.
Other than that, it was a bit further from Gatlinburg than we expected but still a nice stay."

Her guesthouse was exactly as advertised - clean and tidy, quiet and peaceful, and what a view!! I appreciate how clean and tidy everything was and the dinner recommendation was awesome - best burger I’ve ever had! Thanks for such a pleasant stay and a quiet, serene getaway for me and the hubs! We’ll definitely be back!!"

Stayed one night","We had been in Gatlinburg for three days and we had ice between us and home on our last day. I found Susan’s place and we were more than pleased when we got there. It is perfect! I only wish we could have seen the sunrise from the porch(rain). We were so comfortable there and she responded so quickly to my questions, including dinner suggestion(their restaurant), it was delicious. Above and beyond our expectations! If you’re looking for extremely clean, cozy, and extra touches that put this hideaway over the top.....this is your place!
Susan seems to be one that shares kindness with the world(my kind of people)."

We particularly appreciated the lovely layout of the home with a central room for relaxing and two outdoor spaces to sit in rocking chairs and look out over the beautiful property while enjoying a cup of coffee. Checking in was very easy and Susan provided clear directions to the property as well as some recommendations to help us make the most of our stay- including watching the sunrise over the beautiful view of the mountains and visiting their family-owned restaurant. We didn't get to do the latter but will do so if we return to the area. Overall, it was a very comfortable stay- exactly what we hoped for and more!"

Stayed one night","Susan's place is a safe and secure retreat for the weary traveler wanting to see some topography upon rising. Being from Chicago, we don't want to waste a minute when mountain views are on offer. Sitting in a wooden swing to watch the sunrise over the Smoky Mountains (or nestled inside with attractive views out every window) will remain a highlight of our journey through Appalachia. Perfect for a couple in search of quiet with all the modern amenities, this guesthouse with 1.5 baths was more luxury than we could have hoped for. We didn't stay long enough to use the kitchen, but I can imagine lighting that up with my own kit of staples, coffee/tea, spices, salt, sugar and condiments. It is immaculately clean with no evidence of any leftover groceries whatsoever. Laundry soap is provided for use in the top-quality washer/dryer set, and the pump soap on the bathroom vanity is also good for bathing. The decor is the perfect balance of personal charm and welcome-all. Nothing hotel-ish about it other than the brand-new feel of everything in the accommodation. The stage is set with hospitality in mind plus a welcome measure of share-economy cooperation (such as where to put the towels, etc, on check-out). Susan clearly wants you to enjoy the space, and we did. Instructions are clear and logical, not overbearing. Her response time is ideal for people on winding roads in the dark and rain. Our only regret was not getting to meet Susan, as her reviews suggest she's a good conversationist and an interesting host. As Airbnb hosts ourselves, we appreciate seeing what it feels like when done beautifully. And on top of it all, this was the first morning on our road trip to and from Florida that I awoke without a backache. Wonderful."

Plus it was easy to get to Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville and Great Smoky Mountains National park from this location and a scenic drive almost anywhere you go in the area.

If you’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s, this one will feel refreshing- truly like someone’s home, family furniture and all, not a sterile place with the same look and feel as anywhere else.
We particularly loved the great water pressure in the shower, the memory foam pillows, the contactless check in, and - of course - the big lawn with a great mountain view 😊."

I like how easy I can access Gatlinburg and the surrounding areas. The price was affordable and the views were nice. If you are looking for seclusion this may not be the rental for you as the main house is close by. Please don't let that detract from renting this as you do have semi privacy and the home is not attached to the other house. Overall a great place. Thank you for allowing me to stay at your home!"

She also accommodated our late check in needs without missing a beat. The location was great and it was also easy to get to which is important. The pictures truly do not do this place justice. Very roomy, very private, and had a great cozy feeling to it. The view of the mountains was absolutely gorgeous. We loved getting up early and seeing the sun rising over the mountains. Everything we could've possibly needed Susan had already supplied without us even having to ask from blankets to a hairdryer, a heating pad, a washer and dryer, fully functioning kitchen with all utensils provided, extra shampoo and conditioner and so much more! My only wish is that there would've been a TV in the bedroom but everything else was perfect. This place really is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the outskirts of Gatlinburg. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in the area!"

The guesthouse is nicely decorated and very comfortable, and is located on a beautiful hillside with a spectacular view of surrounding mountains. Our only ""glitch"" in the experience was finding that the TV didn't receive input from the satellite provider. When we contacted Susan, she immediately came over to try to resolve the issue; and when she couldn't resolve it, she called her husband who came home from working at their restaurant. After working on the problem for over an hour, they finally fixed the TV - and during that time, we became acquainted with them a bit... they are a great couple, and wonderful hosts! We left the home the next morning after watching the sun rise over the mountains and having breakfast in the well-supplied kitchen/dining area, and agreed it was a great overall experience."

It’s 45 minutes from Gatlinburg, and a gorgeous drive. Perfect for a real getaway, out of the hustle and bustle of city life, but close enough to join in any tourist options you might like. I have stayed in more expensive hotels that were not nearly so clean or well kept. Susan also invited us to try her family’s restaurant, which was fine by us, and the food there was great too! Susan and her husband are very sweet, and their beautiful little guest house is absolutely charming. She really lives up to her Superhost status! My husband and I can’t wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a last-minute weekend getaway and booked this cabin, and I will say that we were all pleasantly surprised that it was actually nicer than it looked on the pictures. We stay at a lot of Airbnb and this so far was one of our favorites. I typically would not go to the same place more than once because we like to try new things, but I would definitely go back here again as it was nice. The house is very private and you can’t even see or hear another home or people from this location and has a great view looking at the mountains and at Douglas Lake. There were other options that may have been closer to where we were going, and that were cheaper, but all the people in our group agreed that this was worth the extra cost and the drive. Great host, super clean home that has a lot of attention to details. The master bathroom room was huge and very nice.
If you are on the fence about which location to book for your trip, it’s time to get off the fence and make the reservation! 😄"

First off, the location is simply breathtaking. The views from the balcony are absolutely stunning, especially during sunrise and sunset.
The cabin itself is an absolute gem. It's the perfect blend of rustic charm and modern comfort. The interior is tastefully decorated with cozy furniture, warm colors, and thoughtful touches that make you feel right at home. And let me tell you, the fireplace is a game-changer. Curling up with a book and a hot cup of coffee in front of a crackling fire is pure bliss.
But what truly sets this place apart is the host. Katlyn is the epitome of hospitality. From the moment I arrived, she made me feel like an old friend.
All in all, I can't recommend this AirB&B enough!"

Immaculately cleaned and well furnished with all that you might need. I felt right at home. It is a bit of a drive from some of the hikes and towns but well worth it!! Several late afternoons I was greeted by 7 deer at the beginning of the road heading up to the house. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting wanting to relax and feel like they want to “get away”. Grateful to have found this place, you will be too!"

We stayed at Katlyn's for a month and she was very responsive and helpful, she even worked around our schedule for lawn maintenance and garbage pick up. The home was so nice and cozy that we often wanted to stay in and enjoy the sunsets from the deck. This was a working holiday for us and the internet worked great for video calls. The location is super private, there are only one or two houses past the cabin on a dead end gravel road so it was a safe place for our dog to run and play with virtually no cars passing by. We'd highly recommend Rocky Ridge to anyone looking for a beautiful and peaceful spot near the Smokies."

From the minute we walked in the door at this beautiful cabin the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. First impressions did not disappoint. The host was prompt in contact to ensure that we were settling in and that we had everything we needed for our stay. And we did, from the amply equipped and beautifully furnished kitchen complete with any utensil or dish that you could think of, to the snack basket loaded with goodies with a personal note and an adequately stocked coffee station with a variety of flavors. We were equally impressed with the other rooms throughout the cabin. I can't say enough good things about this place.  You can tell that the hosts really care about their guests and want them to feel cozy and welcome. We definitely did!
Five stars all way!

Stayed a few nights","This house was by far the best vacation rental we’ve ever stayed in.
The property is beautiful and ALL of the seating options on the porches can accommodate anyone and any “vibe” you’re going for. The umbrella with the lights really kicked it off on those evenings we got to sit outside during the sunsets.
We saw wild turkeys, 2 eagles, salamanders, and got to watch the views of the mountains change all throughout the day- it was beautiful.
INSIDE the house was stunning and the cleanliness was on another level.
All of the little bear decorations (even the deck slats have bears carved into them) were so cute throughout the house. It felt very welcoming and like “home”.
There’s too much to even write about but some honorable mentions in the house need to be shouted out: the shower was amazing, the bathtub was fantastic and such a cool touch to the bathroom, the video game setup upstairs was so much fun, the bed was SO COMFORTABLE and the couch— I want to know where it’s from because I want to go buy one.
Even the gentle closing drawers in the kitchen were a neat touch. 10/10 recommend this cabin.
We drove into gatlinburg 2 days to see the shades car show and the drive itself was only about 45 mins from the cabin and a beautiful, scenic route. Not bad at all if you want to day trip it to town!
Seriously, we cannot talk highly enough of this space. It was everything we needed and wanted for our 5 year anniversary!"

Stayed a few nights",This cabin is just amazing as soon as you walk through the front door. Comfortable and cozy with unforgettable views. This is our second year staying at Katlyn’s beautiful cabin and we can’t wait to come back. Katlyn is an absolutely incredible host. Her #1 concern is that everyone is comfortable and enjoys their stay.

Stayed a few nights","If I could give Katlyn and her beautiful cabin 10 stars I would. This was our first time using AirBNB and to be honest, I was a bit nervous. The property and cabin are beautiful in every way. Cozy but not small, well decorated, private and the views are amazing. Katlyn is so attentive to every detail and she's a genuinely kind person. She is also very good at communicating. Every message I sent to her was promptly answered. Katlyn is well organized and knowledgable of the area. She had a lot of recommendations for things to do and places to eat. Thank you for all of those recommendations Katlyn but we only left the cabin for short outings to the groceries and site seeing. We were so happy with the cabin we spent most of our time enjoying just being there.
The photos on AirBNB are pretty but they do not prepare you for how nice the place is in person.
I would 100% recommend this host and this property! Thank you Katlyn!"

Large kitchen updated kitchen area with everything you need. Wrap around porches!!! Firepit for extra fun. Just 45 min or so to Gatlinburg & Pigeon Forge. An hour to Ashville, NC and the Biltmore Estate. Newport is a nice little town with everything you need. This host pays attention to all the little extras. Nightlights, snacks upon arrival, hangers, lots of extra blankets and pillows. I can’t wait to come back. We had a blast!!!"

Stayed a few nights","You are going to love this house! As all the other reviews mention the view is OUTSTANDING! The house has everything you need, we enjoyed spending time on the patio and even when it rained just laying on the couch with the view was relaxing. Be aware the cicadas are out this year and due to being in the wilderness you will see them more than normal, it didn’t bother us as it’s part of nature and we expected it. The house is well equipped with everything you need, I really enjoyed the tub in the downstairs bathroom ! Peaceful, relaxing and well thought out is how I would describe this house. You can tell Katlyn and her family put extra attention to detail in planning this home.
Book it, you won’t regret it!"

Stayed over a week","What a great place for peace, quiet, reflection and solitude.The large and spacious home had all the comforts of home. Equipped with everything you need for a short or long stay. Enjoyed exploring the area and all the beautiful winding roads and scenery. I hiked with my pup in Bays Mountain park (multiple times), the Smokey mountain national park, Panther Creek Park (tick infested). Rented a pontoon from Indian creek dock (they allow pups in the boats) and spent a half day out in Douglas lake. Explored the Vonore area and Tellico Village, Knoxville, Newport. There is so much to see in eastern Tennesse but relaxing at the cabin with it’s gorgeous view of the Smokey’s was just wonderful.
Katlyn responded quickly whenever I had a question and was a gracious host. Thanks for sharing your slice of heaven."

Stayed a few nights","We just arrived home after spending a few days at Heavenly View. And the name is just that - it’s up high and that Mountain View- is in facth heavenly. We arrive in the afternoon and after going to Newport for groceries and pizza- arrived back to hang out on the deck and just marvel at the mountains. There is no place more relaxing and peaceful than those mountains.
Katlyn was the perfect host - attentive to any questions - but most instructions were clear and well placed. The cabin itself was perfect, homey, well stocked with all we needed. The pictures don’t really do it justice either - trust me you won’t be disappointed!
It was just my husband and I - but the upstairs was great if you were to bring family or friends along. Private and also very nice.
Every place in the great room/kitchen has views to die for and the kitchen is so nice - it’s truly like being at home!
We saw turkeys daily and a deer or 2 as well. The birds chirped, the sun shined bright and the evenings were cool and lovely. The deck faces the mountains - so not only do you have a great view of the mountains -you also have the river/lake too. Plus the suns warms directly shines on the table and chairs on the deck.
We grilled out - the grill worked perfectly too! Although we didn’t take advantage of the fire pit - it was a nicely placed and would be great for hot dogs or s’mores!.
We were there doing a bit of genealogy in Cocke County and neighboring Madison/Buncombe Counties - it’s a short drive and so scenic for a day trip to Hot Springs - which is part of the AT.
Do yourself a favor - visit the cabin, relax, hike, and explore! Thank you Katlyn and Kraig!"

From the picturesque wall of windows to the gleaming hardwoods we knew we had chosen the right place for our relaxing week in TN. It was charming, comfortable and has breathtaking views. We saw deer clattering across the hillsides, and wild turkeys strutting their stuff down the road and in the hills. We made a couple trips into the Pigeon Forge area, spent time with longtime friends who lived nearby, played games, read, watched tv, ate and rested a lot. Thank you for opening up this beautiful cabin for others to enjoy."

We cook a lot and the kitchen had everything we needed and more! Also, the wifi was strong enough to support both of us working remotely (with video calls) every day which was awesome. The deck and outdoor areas were so enjoyable and having the indoor fireplace was great for a few snowy days we were lucky enough to have :) There are tons of awesome hikes 30-45 mins away and the proximity to town for necessities was great.

Looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the lake and mountains is a deep breath and a long hug. Everything we needed was provided, the house was immaculate, and all instructions/tips were helpful. As the owners mention in the reservation, bring wood for the fireplace... you’ll want to keep that treasure going for the duration of your stay (if it’s rained or snowed, you obviously won’t be able to forage it). We loved it here and hope to come back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Sadie greeted us when we parked by coming right up to us and saying hi. We immediately felt right at home. We walked right in and again felt right at home. All of the amenities were exactly as described. The washer and dryer were an excellent benefit that we really appreciated. We used the grill one night and all of the games in the barn made for a great way to wind down. There were also games in the house that we enjoyed. The master bedroom had an excellent memory foam mattress that we really loved. The kitchen had all of the accessories that we needed for cooking our own meals. Walmart and many fast food options were just 5-10 mins away, by car. Feeding the goats and sheep was definitely a highlight. We have family in the area and the next time we are in town, we will be staying here again. There is absolutely nothing that the owners missed. The main house was perfect. If you love animals and feeling at home, this is the place for you."

Stayed with a pet","Andres & Chelsea's place was absolutely lovely! It was exactly what we were looking for to get away and relax. It was far enough outside of the major tourist areas to feel remote and peaceful, but still close enough to drive to amenities and attractions (like Dollywood). The communal barn was beautiful, and a great way to spend some of our time. Sadie was incredibly friendly and well behaved, and our kids and our dog loved her. The goats and sheep were fun to watch also. We had a chance to talk with Andres a few times on the property, and we learned some fun things. You can absolutely see the work and love Chelsea and Andres have put into everything. Honestly the area is so nice, it makes us want to move down here. 💗 We plan on visiting again on our next trip to TN!"

Sadie is a busy resident dog that will not interfere with anything you do.
The hosts, Andres and Chelsea, are so attentive and wanted us to feel at home that anything we needed was delivered the very next day.
Clean, comfortable home with accessible parking with ample room and fun for all guests."

Stayed with kids","We stayed in the Main House, which was so nice and beautiful. My favorite place was the kitchen with it’s gorgeous sink (I know, weird, but I love a good kitchen). Outside was amazing, the scenery beautiful and peaceful, and even with multiple other Airbnb houses close by on the property, The Main House still felt very private. The barn was the coolest feature with it’s multiple games, hammocks, and the fire pit. The farm animals were adorable and added to the charm. Communication from the host was great as well and they were super friendly and helpful. We are looking forward to our next trip out and will definitely be staying again."

We all felt right at home with the comfort of the space, the additional child amenities and the community barn.
We loved walking around the property, playing the games in the barn, using the fire pit and mingling with other guests.
This place is a true gem.
We all left the weekend feeling refreshed and excited to check out their tiny homes and dome tents in the future."

Group trip","This place is exactly as pictured. The house was very clean and had many extras to make you feel welcomed. It is a drive to most places, but it provides the detachment and the local life feeling. The barn was a magnificent addition, providing an extra space to relax and soak in the surroundings.The barn is a relaxed, fun place, very nicely decorated mixing rustic with an elegant flair. The only thing, I would recommend is checking up on the furniture in it, as some is showing some wear. All in all, you won’t be disappointed. Come ready to have a great time. Thank you Mr. Andres and Chelsea for all the work and love you’ve put in. We will cherish our memories at your place."

Group trip","Our group of 3 couples had the best time here! The main house was gorgeous inside and was well decorated, but not crowded. The beds were comfortable and we loved that there were enough pillows! The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and dishes, and was roomy and clean.
The community barn was a group favorite! We used the pizza oven to make homemade pizzas and nachos, ate together each night at the picnic tables, and laughed around the fire pit listening to music. The guys enjoyed darts and the pool table, while the ladies were relaxing in the hammock swings. It was a very laid back environment which we all needed.
It was a lovely trip with beautiful scenery, good food, great friends, and plenty to do!"

When we rain into a problem they were quick to respond and help."
