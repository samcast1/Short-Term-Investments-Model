Stayed one night","What a great place for three adults to spend the night while we went to the casino and Amish Flea Market in Clare. It was very clean and comfortable and had all the kitchen necessities to cook dinner and breakfast. Had a great night’s sleep. The backyard is private and…..what a great place for kids with the playhouse, swings and sandbox! If staying in Mt. Pleasant again, I would definitely try to stay here."

We really enjoyed our time there to attend Carson City Frontier Days--Balloon Fest. The place was very private but Karla was very accessible if needed. We loved the country setting and her flower gardens. It was very kind of her to leave snacks, drinks, and muffins. Notice that there are no cooking facilities but a microwave and toaster oven. We recommend the Middleton Bakery and the Diner but it doesn't open for breakfast. The Rusty Nail isn't too far either. The mattress provided a great night's sleep and we appreciated the fluffy towels. Karla does an amazing job paying attention to details and offering gracious hospitality to her guests."

Most importantly, Karla's service was outstanding!!! she really helped us out. I needed an Iron last minute and she brought one over to me late night. I highly recommend to stay here. take a breather, get away from the grind. enjoy the calm"

We couldn’t find any AC around so we had to open to windows and use the fan that was provided which was good but still a little warm even with the windows open. By the time we were ready for bed it was almost 11 and too late to reach out. Very convenient to campus and allowed my kids to spend extra time together while I was able to get settled for the evening. Thanks so much!!

Stayed with a pet","We booked this place for a funeral (it was a last minute booking) my reservation was booked around 5 pm the day before I needed it and was excepted around 10pm. We had around 6-7 hour drive from our house to the Airbnb and the only complaint I really have is that we couldn’t get into the driveway due to it having about 2 feet of snow on it. So we really didn’t know where the driveway was and we had to shovel it after that long exhausting ride ( we did book last minute). Other than that the house was clean. The kitchen has coffee pots, pots n pans, cups, bowls and a microwave, 2 refrigerators, a gas fireplace and there was a portable electric heater and a fan. The house sits on a lake, the lake was frozen solid so the family did a little ice fishing ( fishing supplies on site) The neighbors were very friendly. It also has the older baseboard heaters and the 1st night was pretty cold. It was hard to warm it up even with the fireplace. Would I book it again YES! All in all very Comfy!"

Stayed a few nights","Stacee's Lakeside Cottage is marvelous. It is well-provisioned and very comfortable. We were here mid-November, and although it was cold and blustery outside, the cottage was warm and cozy. The kitchen is small but full of utensils, pots, pans, cooking paraphernalia and lots of plates and cups and mugs. You enter through the garage which is set up as another lounging space (is this a Michigan thing?) so don't be surprised when you first walk in. The windows look out upon the small but scenic lake outside. The road around the lake is very walkable. The neighbors are friendly and helpful. The beds are comfortable. The geese serenaded us at all hours, which was delightful. There are also lots of supplies for boating or fishing (neither of which we did, but they were there anyway). It is about 20 minutes from any town, but that makes it even more of a getaway. We will come and stay again in the future!"

This was our first experience booking an airbnb and everything worked out fine. Several lakes to kayak on within a 5-10 minute drive."

Stayed a few nights","Such a cozy cottage! Opening the large windows in the main living area to let in the summer breeze makes for a perfect and peaceful time to unwind and recharge.
Bedrooms and dining area had new high quality ceiling fans installed and several portable fans to use. The bathroom was fully loaded with an abundance of communal toiletries, towels, and packs of toilet paper. The kitchen was also fully loaded, and both bedrooms had many extra blankets. The home was very clean, especially for a place that allows pets! No weird smells, stains, or stray dog hair at all on the floors, linens, or couches.
Couple of things as a heads up: the area felt very safe, but for nighttime privacy there are only curtain sheers in the home and an accordian door for one of the bedrooms which didn't close all the way for us. The home is also on well water, so bring water bottles if you're not accustomed (there's a great little grocery store 10 min away).
Loved our stay there, very refreshing!"

Stayed one night","Stacee and her dad accommodated an early check in for our 37th anniversary. The hosts were finishing up as we arrived and walked us around the home. They were very friendly and took great care to provide a comfortable and clean place to stay. The lake is very peaceful and quiet. We used the aluminum rowboat, and they had ample fishing gear that was available for us to use. We didn't use the kayaks but plan on a return visit when we have more time. This is a great place to get away and we highly recommend.

The cabin is quaint, simple and very peaceful. We didn’t have AC during our stay, but thankfully the weather was beautiful and we even needed some additional blankets at night with all the windows open.
Full disclosure, we came to town for a family reunion and didn’t rent this place with the intention of using the lake amenities but it was still a great deal!
We would love to comeback hand have an actual “lake vacation” because this place is very cute and has everything we need."

Stayed with a pet","Cozy cottage on a small lake! We enjoyed our stay for a three day getaway. Not much to do locally, but we enjoyed having a few lazy days. My young boys enjoyed fishing off the dock and caught plenty of small blue gill. Not able to swim off the dock, but you can swim in the middle of the lake. The cottage was small, but had everything needed for our stay."

Stayed with a pet",The property was as described. We mainly were just fishing. It was very quiet almost in the middle of nowhere. Host was very quick to answer questions. They had many items needed for grilling/bonfires which was nice. Our only minor complaint was the paddle boat had water inside it that we were unable to get out which made us nervous to take it out. The other small boat worked fine but it would slowly take in water. Every 2-3 hours we would have to come back in to drain it out. Overall it was a great experience.

Stayed a few nights","It was a wonderful stay. The inside was nice and felt clean. The environment was very relaxing and well set up.
The fridge was a bit on the small side but made sense in the space and was enough for the 2 of us. The kitchen has dishes, pots & pans, as well as cups and whatnot, which was very nice
There is a neighbor that is close but didn't bother us any and seemed friendly enough.
The body of water had decent size fish and plenty as my bf caught 6 of them. The host even offered fishing equipment as well as kayaks. There was quite a bit of seaweed, so you have to paddle out to get past it. The internet worked well, and we were able to watch movies.
There is a place to get wood about 7 minutes from the cabin cash needed to purchase it.
There are only shear curtains on the windows, so keep that in mind. It didn't bother me, but it may some people.
Overall, I have no complaints."

In the winter, the road to get there was a bit rough and bumpy, but they made a good effort to plow the snow. It was passable for FWD cars, but a vehicle with a taller suspension would be better suited there in winter conditions.

Even though Mother Nature had plans of her own, and we didn't get to do what we originally planned, to wake up in the morning and look out to see the sun come up over the lake was a real treat. It's a very scenic area.
Check-in and check-out was super easy. Check-out time was perfect at 3pm.
We had pots, pans, and dishes provided for cooking meals, as well as plenty of bottled water, as the area's water has a high iron content.
We needed a couple things from the store that we hadn't packed but, we weren't far from shopping.
The bedding was clean and there were plenty of extra blankets, if needed; plenty of towels and some toiletries were provided.
Overall, we had a very pleasant, peaceful stay and would go again."

Stayed a few nights","When you get a super cute cabin with a fabulous view and a host who goes above and beyond… its a recipe for a fantastic trip. The instructions right from address to getting in, around were on point. The cabin was so cute and clean. It felt spacious. The host had little (pleasant) surprises throughout the cabin which made the stay even better. Our teen daughter wanted to try fishing for the first time and the host not only gave their own stuff but also taught her how to fish. There were kayaks and paddle boats and we had fun using them. The house was recently renovated and you can see the love, effort and dedication that has gone into it. We would love to come back again. Thank you!!"

Stayed with kids","My family LOVED this place! We hit all the available watercraft running and didn't stop paddling until after dark! The lake is super peaceful and calm...perfect for feeling secure to let the kids be out there. Angie went above and beyond in offering some of her own additional watercraft once she saw that our family really enjoyed being on the water, and in offering to let us stay later than the posted check out. The cottage looks small and super cute, but packs a big punch! The open living space is roomy and comfy, the kitchen looks brand new and is squeaky clean, and the bedrooms were nice with very comfortable beds. We enjoyed the games that were there, and the drinks and snacks Angie left for us. We had EVERYTHING we needed, and after a week of staying in a different Airbnb every night, we all agreed this one was our favorite! Thanks Angie!"

We fished, played in the water, relaxed, played games, watched movies, and didn’t want to leave. Angie is very responsive should you need anything. But, you won’t need anything.

I’m sure it’s even more beautiful when the sun is out, but since we’re from Seattle we actually loved the misty, moist weather. The cabin is in a quiet area and is beautifully decorated, clean and neat. The bed had a memory foam topper that we loved and the kitchen had all the essential utensils/pans/S&P, etc. we needed to cook our own meals. Lots of thoughtful touches like games and books, soft fluffy towels, snacks, plenty of bottled water and coffee. It was obvious that Angie cares about making her guests feel comfortable. We had a great visit!"

We were greeted by Daniel’s wife the second we pulled up to the driveway and she helped us find where to park and enter! It was a great and kind welcome! When we walked in it immediately felt like home! It was so comfy and they even gave us two free muffins that were absolutely scrumptious. Me and my daughter watched movies and explored the campus. On top of all of this hospitality, they helped us in a time of trouble. My daughter forgot to print her parking pass for another college we wanted to visit and needed it urgently. We called up Daniel and he and his wife printed it out and delivered it to our door within an hour. Made my day. Needless to say, if my daughter decides to attend this college (which seems very possible ;) I will be back. Thanks for everything! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Daniel even offered to come out and start a bon fire for us! We ran out of time for that as well aS viewing the little art gallery created by Daniel’s talented wife and son, but plan to on our next visit. We did see some art originals in the cabin and enjoyed those. The surroundings are beautiful and couldn’t be more private. We saw multiple deer in the yard and the outdoor space was inviting with a large deck and seating available there as well as out and about in the yard and surrounding woodsy area. Yummy muffins and treats were a nice touch. I confidently recommend this beautiful cabin to anyone looking to stay in the area. Daniel is the perfect host and your stay is sure to be wonderful!"

( all slept well) Secluded wooded area, quiet. Attached to the back of the owners main house. But very quiet, private entrance. Fire pit with wood provided ( even fire starter logs available 😊). Has private deck area, and patio tables and chairs.
Loft area sleeps 4 but there are skylights in the ceiling, so bring a sleep mask if you are light sensitive when sleeping.
Kitchen has basics, but may want to bring storage containers or ziplock bags, foil, etc.

Stayed a few nights",We traveled to Mt. Pleasant to celebrate our anniversary and go to a concert at Soaring Eagle Resort. The house is cozy and clean a great modern log cabin. The beds were comfortable. The location is a nature lovers dream with a lot of wildlife. Daniel was helpful and helped to make our stay enjoyable by recommending restaurants and things to do in the area. It would be great for a larger family. Nice deck and fire pit in the yard. Definitely would stay here again😀

Group trip","What a great place to relax!
We were in Mt. Pleasant for one night to attend a wedding and booked this home instead of a hotel. We are all glad we did!
The property is peaceful, quiet and very relaxing. Set back off the road and through the wooded drive, the log home has a cozy updated cabin feel. The loft is amazing with a bathroom and three beds. The master bedroom is simple but spacious.
Everything was neat, clean, and comfortable. As a bonus, the complimentary muffins were delicious and their personalized decorations were thoughtful. Daniel was extra accommodating with check-in and communication was timely and friendly.
We would definitely book this place again if we are back in Mt. Pleasant."

Stayed with kids","Pine Lodge provided the perfect place for our family to stay for the weekend of our son's wedding at Little Flower Barn at Lake Isabella. It was so helpful to have a full kitchen not only for refrigerator space but as a place to do some food prep for all the various meals over the weekend as we prepared rehearsal dinner, breakfast the morning of, appetizers for the wedding, and then brunch the day after. In addition, there were delicious muffins and snacks left by the hosts for us to enjoy. We could not have asked for better accommodations. It was the perfect distance away and had the amenities we needed that no hotel would have provided. Although we live less than 45 minutes away, staying at Pine Lodge, which was less than 10 miles from the venue, and being able to come and go as needed over the 3 days was a huge blessing for my husband and myself and my sister and her family. We would definitely choose Pine Lodge again if we ever had a need for overnight accommodations the the area."

The only thing is it says 2 bedrooms and the upstairs loft bedroom is actually open to the living room and did not have a door. Could see and hear everything between the livingroom and loft. Also the sun lights shine right on the upstairs queen bed. Also the well water smell/feel was not amazing but understandable given location. All around a great value and cozy though!

From the firepit in the secluded backyard to the spacious inside, this is a great place to be just far enough outside of town to feel alone and close enough to have everything Mt Pleasant has to offer in a short drive."

We loved sitting at the table on the deck for a long, relaxing breakfast under the umbrella watching the birds come to the feeder and hearing the sounds of the woods. Having two bathrooms was an extra bonus since we shared our stay with another couple. Plenty of room to lounge or just get away on our own. The full kitchen, complete with cooking utensils, appliances and dishwasher, gave us the opportunity to prepare our own omelettes, toast, coffee and snacks during our stay. The muffins that were provided for us by our host were delicious! Daniel and Randy were such gracious hosts and responded immediately to our texts. Without reservation, we highly recommend this private retreat."

The lake is a hidden gem - sandy bottom and perfect size for our kids (9 and 11) to kayak and paddle board. We stopped at Walmart in Alma for food and then any little things we needed we got at the Dollar General or gas station less than a mile away. Oh and the ice cream place up the road is great. 3Ds pizza was also good and they even delivered and it was super quick. Everyone in our party said that they want to return next summer.
My only tip would be to pack your own pillows if you are picky/particular like me. I wish I would have as the pillow was a little small/flat for my taste."

We did rent the boat, was an added bonus. We had some trouble with it, and does not have a very high maximum speed. We did also get stuck out in the lake for a bit. Jeb was absolutely wonderful in helping us get it back on, so we very much appreciated his quick communication on that!

My friend and I came to Michigan for work and ended up extending our stay to relax for the weekend after a busy work conference.
The home is soooo beautifully pull together. Every detail was carefully thought out! I loved all the decor.
What made this stay even better was the beach and patio seating area! My friend and I sat out in the chairs for hours enjoying nature and a few glasses of wine into the sun set.
We ended the evening with a nice campfire under the stars!!!
It was just what this mama needed!!
I loved the place so much that I wanted to book it for a couple weeks after when I came back to town for my niece’s graduation, unfortunately for me, it was already booked!

Stayed with kids","1) The place was perfect for our needs. Lots of space both inside (expansive kitchen/dining room/sitting room) and outside (deck, large yard, children's playset, etc.). The long driveway meant that we were far from the main road.
2) There were several positive surprises for travelers with small children: a variety of toys/board games were available inside, the kitchen was stocked with toddler plates/cups/cutlery, and the outdoor playset was a fun outdoor diversion.
3) John/Cheri were extremely responsive to communications (quick replies with relevant/detailed information).
4) You know at time of booking that the location is quite rural and removed from any major towns...but I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of stores/amenities within a 15 minute drive. There was a donut shop and a gas station less than 5 minutes up the road that were useful in a pinch. And there was a loaf of bread, some butter, and a little local honey waiting for us when we arrived. Huge win!"

Group trip","Cheri’s place at The Maplely Farm was phenomenal. The calm of the farm, the gorgeous view of the fields, the farm animals and the wildlife were absolutely a highlight on our trip across Michigan. It was a delight to hear the baby lambs bleating as we rolled in, and our daughters are still raving about the baby kittens. After hours in the car, we instantly felt at home and relaxed when we stepped into the farm.
The apartment was spacious— easy to spread out a family of six. We loved the king beds! This listing was right next to Cheri’s home but we felt like we had plenty of privacy and space to ourselves; we had our own entrance, and parking space, porch, and backyard space complete with a play structure and basketball hoop.
Our favorite part was just hanging out and enjoying the refreshing and relaxing vibes. We will absolutely be back!"

A lot of windows in the living room to enjoy the sunrise and the outdoor view. Cheri's husband (John) gave us a tour to the sheep farm that they own and it was a unique experience for me and my family to see that many sheep and great to see the new borns. John also explained to us in detail how the farm works (excellent experience).
Great areas to walk and while sitting on the deck enjoy the view of the pond (very relaxing). Definitely, my family and I will find another excuse to go back to Cheri's place. Highly recommended for any one that would like to have those relaxing moments in the country!

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed our stay. It was a terrific place. We highly recommend this property especially if you like having a gym right on site. Close to Mount Pleasant and all the sporting events too. We will be back.

Stayed one night",We really needed to drop our stuff earlier then check in and they accommodated. They were kind and welcoming. Joseph met us at the door and walked us through everything. The bed was extremely comfortable. I had the best sleep ever. They also accommodated my daughter at the last minute. She ended up staying with us. The red light sauna was awesome. I will definitely stay again! Great for us Alma College parents.

Stayed one night","We needed a place to stay for one night before a nearby conference, and Jospeh and Brenda's place fit the bill, just minutes from the CMU campus.
Joseph and Brenda were excellent hosts and very friendly. They had plenty of recommendations and have lots of experience using Airbnb's themselves. The accommodations are HUGE, with a wide-open feel. It is in a basement, but the floors are nicely painted and there are some rugs.
Everything was super clean and welcoming. We took advantage of the theater area, the gym and the sauna...I even had room to get in a decent walk inside after my workout. The bed was very comfortable, and there was an assortment of pillows, so you're bound to find one or two you like.
This was a GEM of a find, and we will definitely stay there again. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is because I want to be sure it's available whenever we want to come to town!
Book it, you won't be unhappy!"

I imagine as a newer rental, this property will get even better! Would stay here again"

If I were to nitpick there was only 2 things that could have been better, upstairs didn't have covers on the outlets but I just had my grandkids sleep downstairs on the couch and the trash in the kitchen was half full when we arrived, but I wasn't too bothered by it. Basic, but comfortable!"

Group trip","My clan and I really enjoyed Doug’s place!
We were in town for a wedding 20 mins away and this was a perfect spot to hunker down for 2 nights after wedding festivities.
There was a convenient gas station / dollar general right down the road for our last minute needs. Since we were just here for the wedding we didn’t get to explore much of the surrounding area but the location was peaceful.
Very cozy, clean, comfortable place.
Would recommend.
Thanks Doug!"

Stayed with kids","My daughter attends CMU. We stayed at Doug's place so that we could bring our dog and cook our own meals. The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The town doesn't have much to offer, not much there. But I expected that and preferred the quiet. But if you are looking for anything other than a place to stay, not sure you will find it here. The fire pit was nice and we spent the early evening around it. I can't imagine the two tree swings out back would support much weight. My only disappointment is that we couldn't get the internet working. The only reason we were disappointed was because my son was looking forward to watching a particular movie with his sister over the visit and we couldn't get it on the TVs nor our computers without the internet. Overall it was a good stay and I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a place to stay in the area. Didn't get to the ice cream shop... maybe next time."

Stayed over a week",In the areas for work for little over a month and wanted something other then a hotel. Came across this and it was the best find I’ve had! The area is in a very small town and so relaxing after a long days work. The house has a perfect set up with everything you need. Doug was very helpful and responded quick if needed. If you are in the area I highly recommend you to try Dougs place! If I’m ever in the area again I will be booking here.

We actually enjoyed being away from the digital chaos that can overwhelm our lives. Thank you for the great experience. It was truly a great way to celebrate my daughter’s graduation. Thank you again!

Stayed a few nights",We needed the a place to stay for a week for a competition happening at the college and this was an even greater experience than we expected. Our favorite feature is the space to be in nature while enjoying a campfire. One of the last nights there we invited some other schools to enjoy the campfire and some s’mores and it was such a hit to have all the students come together and share a friendly space that allowed for community to thrive. We will miss the cabin but we will carry the memories we made there.

Group trip","This was my 1st Airbnb experience and from the first moment I decided to go with Micah's beautiful cabin I felt ""heard""! From needing to add an additional day, to it being my daughter's birthday party & her looking forward to a bonfire... there was a b-day🎈 bouquet on the table with a pk of 🔥 - starters & plenty of 🪵 stacked out by the fire pit! The cabin itself is on a gorgeous slice of land and the sound from the pond pump was like a babbling brook...so very peaceful! There were plenty of pillows, blankets and everything you could need, even internet if you weren't interested in unplugging. Plenty of beds and rooms to choose from, even a futon couch in the open area where the upstairs Bannister is, just inviting you to curl up and read a good book! Micah was an amazing & very responsive host and made this mammas hopes for a gr8 party easy to manage! definitely will be coming back again!"

This quaint and cozy cabin will get you back to feeling like a youngin and provide quality family time where you can reconnect with conversations, family meals, board games, and great outdoor scenery with access to a pond! No television to distract you from connecting with your loved ones. My husband and I enjoyed the quiet, and our pups truly loved everything! Disconnecting from the world is sometimes all you need to reboot yourself . We will most definitelybook again! We only wish we were able to stay longer than 2 days."

Prefect location in comparison to the rest of campus/downtown: walking distance to everything without being mixed in with dormitory living. Plus the house itself is great. Perfect size for a comfortable two or a cozy three person group. Having been here twice, I imagine staying anywhere else in Alma."
