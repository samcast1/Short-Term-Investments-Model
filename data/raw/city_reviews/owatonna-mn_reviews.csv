Stayed a few nights","This place was exactly as description, murphy bed included. Sarah was very responsive and provide clear instructions on how to check-in and a segregate contacts since she was out of town. This is a nice place for a few days when traveling in the area. There is nothing open in town on Sunday morning, except for the McDonalds which is a good alternate. We ate at one of the best Mexican Restaurants ever, Mis Tres Flores, and we are from Florida. We did not expect to get authentic, to us, Mexican cuisine in Minnesota. Even though I only popped popcorn in the kitchen, it was well equipped with the basics needs to prepare a meal. This is what I love about AirBNB, the kitchens with full size refrigerators, so much better then a hotel room. Oh, the restaurant downstairs is a must too. Great cocktails and specials."

Stayed one night","My wife and I stayed in the ""Jones'"" Room of Sarah's location. She did an amazing job of taking an old space and converting it into a quaint and cozy space. The design features within the space were awesome (a mix of industrial and modern) and it added to the enjoyment of our stay.
The nightly rate for this space was very reasonable when you compare it to other area hotel chains, and I believe this offers a more personable experience.
Sarah's friendly, flexible, and proactive personality also made it very easy to communicate as we prepared for our stay. She was willing to do what was needed to make our stay enjoyable.
Since this location is in my wife's home town, it was great to be able to support a local entrepreneur. We look forward to staying at this location for future visits."

The condo is really nice and has everything you need for a great stay! Location is great as well - close to everything. Unfortunately, since we were there on a Sunday, we were not able to check out the restaurant downstairs. Only negative (which can’t really be helped) was loud street/traffic noise starting before 5am. Not sure if that is normal, but we were kept up because of it. Other than that, it’s such a great spot and unbeatable location!"

What was a pitstop on a roadtrip turned into a place we’d love to come back and visit!

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here while visiting family and it is definitely a convenient location but overall I was not very impressed with this Airbnb.
Upon arriving to the unit we were immediately greeted with a LOT of dust. The light over the door, the tv, the kitchen surfaces, and most noticeably, the thick layer on the air intake register for the air conditioner. It made the rest of the place feel unclean.
A studio should be full of useful ways to make the most of the space and outside of the Murphy bed, it certainly was not. There was an abundance of unnecessary fake plants on anything you could have used for storage and almost nowhere to put things in the bathroom while getting ready.
The bathroom sink was barely usable because of the placement of the faucet.
The furniture and pillows are cheap and uncomfortable but luckily the bed was fine.
They went for form over function on everything. Looks good/not functional.
We would stay again as it was convenient, but perhaps in a different room."

Stayed a few nights","The space was updated and very cute. All necessities were stocked so we didn't need anything. We arrived a little early and Sarah was very responsive. She helped with some other questions upon arrival as well. One minor thing is the murphy bed...but it's more personal preference because we are used to a king size bed and something a little softer. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back!"

Both spaces were welcoming and we wanted for nothing during our stay. Sarah has thought of everything!! The rooms were bright and extremely clean. Sarah was super accommodating and made the check-in and check-out a breeze. The rooms are conveniently located downtown and we were able to explore the shops by day and the nightlife without driving anywhere. Our stay was absolutely perfect and what we were looking for.

The service at The Bar was slow but the food and drinks were delicious! The studio apartment was very cute and had everything you need. A more comfortable couch or chair would have been nice. The old building had thin walls. Not ideal for light sleepers; you can hear the train whistle and can hear people talking in the hallway. Everything else about the apartment was nice and Sarah was very kind and helpful.

Stayed a few nights","Carly was an amazing host. The pig house was incredibly clean and comfortable. Everything was as described. Due to some unfortunate personal issues, I had to cut my stay short and Carly was so understanding and kind! Her words will be held close to my heart for some time. I would absolutely stay again. The house was beautiful with a great view of the lake. This was my first time ever in Albert Lea and Carly's place made my stay enjoyable! The pig theme was SO cute! Absolutely adorable. Loved having the rules on the fridge as a reminder and the little map was so helpful too! The shower was heavenly and I really enjoyed the driveway being so large for multiple vehicles. Having a washer and dryer on site was so helpful and the two tvs made the comfort factor go up tenfold! Everything was homey. The kitchen was perfect and we utilized it to make delicious meals and snacks. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone traveling and searching for a home away from home from an incredible host."

Great walk in shower, all the appliances you’d need and a really nice park right across the street. We’ll definitely try and book this again."

Comfortable with all the cooking options, and a nice big desk for study time at night. The bed was great! The park across the street has a great walking/running trail which is fantastic.

The bedroom was much larger than expected and has a full bed and a twin bed. There is also a pack-n-play that can be set up! This space was very helpful while traveling with an infant who still needs nap time.
There is also shampoo/conditioner and a hairdryer -so ladies you can pack a little lighter...maybe.
Location is right next to a park with a walking path and playground- perfect.
Luke also responds quickly to any questions/concerns. Very hospital and we will be staying there again!"

Being a basement apartment (tho with full sized windows), it seemed a bit quieter to outside noises. The bed was one of the more comfortable we’ve slept on also (NOT memory foam!).

The bedroom is comfortable and incredibly spacious. The kitchen is well equipped and ready to go if you decide to fix a meal or just have coffee. The TV area has a nice couch and TV big enough to watch your favorite series or news just to relax after a long day at the office. Altogether, this place worked very well for me and planning to stay here next time I come back to Owatonna. Thanks Luke"

I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The entire apartment was described as advertised and Luke called me before I arrived to make sure I knew what to expect. He lives close by, so he immediately could respond to any of my questions or concerns. My stay at Luke's place was so great that I extended my contract by an additional 5 days. The place is in a safe and quiet neighborhood and Owatonna is a beautiful city that has a hometown feel, yet still carries metropolitan amenities, like Starbucks. The kitchen is a cozy and a highly functional space with new appliances. The bedroom is large with a comfortable bed and the living area is very comfortable. This is a perfect place for anyone looking for a cozy home away from home."

Stayed a few nights","This is my first time doing this. I didn’t know that renting out rooms was even a possibility on Airbnb. I didn’t understand that this house is tri-level house. So I rented 2 rooms in the basement. There was no way to get to our room without going through the front door. The only thing separating you from the owners of the house is a curtain that leads to the stairs to the front door/main living room. Also, if you only rent one room, someone is able to rent the other room across from yours and you would share a bathroom. I misunderstood when I made the deal. But I was a little ataken back with the lack of privacy. That being said, The hosts were very kind and friendly and never intruded on us. I just think they should update their space to be more private for the guests."

Stayed a few nights","Sarah's 'Miller Room' was even nicer than the pictures show. She has honestly thought of absolutely everything!
The kitchen was very nice to have for morning coffee and sitting around for conversation in the AM. The bathroom has a nice XL walk-in shower with organic shampoo and conditioner. She also supplied two types of wash: bar and sheabutter body wash. Towels and linens were soft and fresh. The bed was large and super comfy. Having down pillows and comforter was sooo luxurious. We appreciated the ability to control the temp as my husband and I run 'hot' and could set the temp to a nice cool 68° to sleep in. The sound maker machine clock combo was nice to have to help me fall to sleep. We weren't bothered by any street noise or noise from other patrons...there wasn't any noise!
The Refinery 507 downstairs is also a great find! Food is incredibly priced and tastes amazing!
Overall, our stay was amazing and we would recommend Sarah's place to anyone and everyone. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I cannot speak highly enough about Kim and her family's tiny house! It was clean, cozy, practical, and full of delight. Kim called once I arrived to check in on me and make some local recommendations. She was very considerate and made the experience feel personalized. The little cabin is a perfect space to retreat and is so full of love and thoughtfulness. Even though neighbors are close, you still get the experience of peaceful solitude. I enjoyed my time reading, relaxing, sitting by the fire, and kayaking on the lake. The tiny house is an exercise in living simply yet having everything you need. The cost is also very reasonable considering the included amenities. (It's outrageous how much it can cost to rent a kayak!) Could not recommend enough."

Everything about the stay was prefect. More than a Tiny Home, a BIG experience!
My husband and I stayed a couple of days. He enjoyed being able to fish at the lake I enjoyed the paddle boat and relaxing in the hammock.
Though it is a tiny house, it had everything we needed. Decor was so cute and boho. Comfy bed, hot shower with great water pressure.
Kim was an excellent host! The attention was in the details. Loved the little notes throughout the house, The plants, The handmade organic soap! We went to the coffee shop she recommended and did some shopping. She truly made us feel like we were a guest in her home and wanted us to have the best time!
The lake was awesome. Great lake community and beautiful scenery. I'm already planning our next stay!"

Kim had excellent recommendations for restaurants in the area and we loved the view from the tiny house. Although the weather was too cold for any lake activity, we still enjoyed the scenery from the shore and hope to come back in the summer. Our favorite local restaurants were Janna’s Market and Grille (the owner was just the sweetest!) and Redemption (such good food and service and the atmosphere was fantastic). Faribault had so much to offer and Owatonna was a great place to scope out as well. Since we came over a holiday weekend, many places of interest were closed, but we plan to return again to see more of the things to do in the area. We highly recommend this terrific tiny house!"

The mattress was great, I did not have any back pain or discomfort (a common problem with mattresses when I travel). The shower is awesome: there is a tankless water heater and good water pressure, so if you have long, very thick hair like me, I’m happy to say that you’ll be able to rinse it very well AND not worry about running out of hot water. The natural light is amazing, loved all the plants. I also made good use of the deck and outdoor fire. This was perfect for one person, I plan to return for another me-weekend. Thanks so much to the wonderful host, Kim!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a lovely time getting to spend time by myself as a birthday gift. The ride down from the Twin Cities was easy and straightforward with stops by a few shopping areas.
Once you get there, there is a clear parking spot with stairs leading down to the house. The outside space is spacious and includes the area down to the left, the yellow dock. The tiny home itself is easy to access. It was easy to cook and clean with the given utensils and supplies. Surprisingly the bathroom doesn’t feel that small. I really enjoyed the loft area and since I am short, was able to sit up with plenty of head space. I loved being able to read in the hammock with its view of the lake and when it got dark, stargazing. Overall, I enjoyed my time alone with this tiny home.
Kim, the lovely host gives recommendations for additional activities in the area. She’s quick to respond and easy to talk to.

The tiny looked just like the pictures, clean and beautifully decorated, and truthfully as taller people we had way more room than expected! The loft was super cute and the bed was so comfy, having the TV just above the bed made us feel so spoiled😂 Our visit was in July so the heat and humidity were high, but the AC in the tiny home worked amazing and things cooled off overnight. We sat out every night on the giant deck and used the gorgeous fire pit (wood provided!). It was SUCH a peaceful getaway. Having our own dock on the lake and paddle boat was incredibly fun as well! The home was beyond gorgeous and Kim really thought of everything one could need and was super responsive to any questions we had.

The outdoor space has everything from a large deck, lounge chairs, hammock, grill, kayaks, paddle boat, and dock into the lake.

I opened the door to a personalized welcome note and little post-its helping me navigate...Kim stopped by to say hi and meet my dog Charlie and make sure I got settled in, and even called restaurants to see if my little dog would be allowed to come on the patio! The house is AMAZING! You have to see it and experience it to appreciate it! Kim and her family have literally thought of everything and packaged everything into a small space! All the decorations are darling and artistic. Be sure to check out their story in the book ""Turning Tiny"" -- SOO inspiring!! The location is perfect - secluded but with a big patio and looking right out on the lake! The weather was perfect and the lake so fun!! You'll have an amazing time and be inspired by the simplicity and connection to nature! We had a WONDERFUL stay!!"

Kim stopped by to say hi when we arrived, and we had fun chatting about tiny house living with her. She gave us a comprehensive list of recommendations for hiking, exploring, eating and drinking in the area, and we were able to visit a lot of them and really enjoyed them. We also enjoyed just hanging out at the tiny house, sitting on the deck, watching the sunset, and borrowing the provided kayaks to go out on the lake. Kim was very responsive to any questions we had, and our stay was so comfortable and fun. We highly recommend this place!"

They were constantly walking right through the property, luckily not during our ceremony!

I loved all of the details, such as lights around the house at night, multiple seating areas on different levels, eco friendly hand & dish soap, notes around the house, a small wren house with baby birds. We loved kayaking and tried the paddle boat. My favorite was early in the morning sitting either out on the dock steps or by the fire pit with a cup of coffee or hearing the rain out the loft window at night. We brought our bikes for the Sakatah trail, rode 25 miles, came back and fell asleep on the hammock. Couldn't have wished for any better of a time."

The home offers a beautiful view of the lake and is a great spot to watch both the sunrise and sunset. Kim was very considerate of our time and space, and was extremely responsive starting from the time we made our reservation to the end of our stay, helping us immediately address any concerns we had. The reading nook was so cozy, and the leisure loft was stocked with fun activities to keep us occupied. If you're willing to brave the winter weather, you can enjoy a nice fire out on the deck. If you're planning on cooking, the kitchen is stocked with the essential tools (one thing to keep in mind is that there's a small toaster oven, not a full-size oven, if that's something you need). Overall, a wonderful space to relax."

Kim also met with us the day we arrived to welcome us and helped us with questions and recommendations. We definitely will come again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything that Kim offers is 100% accurate. Furthermore, she provides so many extra little things in the tiny house that make it so much more of an experience. She sets you up so that from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave, you are all set. However, IF you should need anything, she is readily available and makes that very clear. From my initial booking, her response times were impressive and that was consistent from the initial communication until the follow up after my amazing stay. I plan to return again in 2022!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first time ever using Air BnB and this was the best experience we could have ever had! The space was beautifully designed with so many personal touches. I loved the aromatherapy diffuser, pillows in the leisure loft, and homemade hand soap. The location was absolutely divine right on the water. We went just as the lake was freezing over so it was fun to watch it freeze a bit more each day. We grilled every night on the gas grill and made fires in fire pit when the wind allowed. We brought an entire thanksgiving dinner (turkey breast, potatoes, sweet potatoes, stuffing,gravey) and it all fit in the mini fridge. I’m glad I pre-cooked though because there are a total of 3 burners (counting the bonus one attached to the grill) so cooking that much from scratch would have been challenging to time. We were initially nervous about how much hot water there would be, but were pleasantly surprised that there was more than enough for two consecutive showers. The space was perfect for the two of us (medium sized adults) but I could see it being a bit too small for a group larger than two. Just an FYI, for those who might have mobility challenges, doing stairs is absolutely necessary to access the houses. The only way to access the loft is by ladder, and the only way to get to the leisure loft is to crawl along a “hallway” on hands and knees. We loved the adventure and the space!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Where do I begin…what an amazing tiny home and equally amazing family hosting it! Booking this home was easy and Kim did an excellent job communicating before, during, and after the stay. Upon our arrival to the tiny home after a long day at work, Kim had made a special trip to the tiny home to turn on the heat and some lights!! Extremely welcoming host and space. The next morning, Kim stopped by following our welcome to say hello! Our stay at this tiny house was in celebration of our 2nd wedding anniversary, 5 years together. My husband also dreams of building a tiny house of our own! Kim was wonderful about answering my husband’s many tiny house questions. Hearing her first hand experience and what they have learned was priceless. Kim also gave us lots of great recommendations for food and fun in the area. The tiny house is a warm, cozy space full of natural wood, bright colors, and beautiful house plants. The attention of detail is splendid. Little things like the tiny fan in the loft where you sleep and soaps & q-tips in the bathroom made our stay ideal. Only trick is no oven (there is a small toaster oven) so we ended up making lasagna on the wonderful grill that is provided. Wood and fire pit are also provided. The mattress in the loft was surprisingly comfortable! The tiny house is surrounded by a beautiful deck overlooking the lake. We didn’t want to leave and hope to be back! Bless this Tiny House!!"

You won’t be searching for much more, though, as she’s literally thought of everything. We were so impressed with the design and accommodations in the tiny house. The furnishings, amenities, toiletries, and overall design makes the stay effortless, cozy, and comfortable. There were even things I never knew I needed (**the cute little fan in the loft**). We especially enjoyed all of wonderful little design elements that kept us looking and interested every day; trinkets, books, little notes, plants, blankets, cute curtains, vintage light bulbs, the list goes on. The outdoor spaces and accommodations are beautiful and functional, and the sunsets on the lake are beautiful. The location is fantastic. Easy and fast access to Faribault, Northfield, and Owatonna, all with extraordinary history, shopping, dining, and attractions/destinations. Truly a hidden gem. Thank you for a wonderful opportunity to reconnect as a couple and break away from the daily grind. We are definitely looking forward to more trips 💗 God bless"

Stayed a few nights","The tiny house was GREAT! I am a stickler for cleanliness and this place was extremely clean. It also is better esthetically than the photos which is hard to imagine possible. SO beautiful. There were also a lot of touches that went above and beyond expectation (ie: a Polaroid camera for you to use, complimentary soda waters, bug spray wipes, grilling equipment, a French press, etc). There was also extra care for comfort that I think comes from the hosts previously living there (ie: fan in the loft, reading light, extra pillows etc).
The only things I would be aware of next time is the location itself. Everything was closed Monday-Wednesday (making our Monday-Wednesday stay a little rough to find things to do) I also would be advised that the lake truly is at this time of year (end of July) so thick with moss getting in wasn’t really an option."

We were there for an unplugged couple’s getaway. We spent lots of time in the lounge chairs enjoying the view of the lake and watching the boats. We also played many card games on the deck.
We highly suggest Crack of Dawn Bakehouse for breakfast. We also grabbed some donuts at Roberd’s Resort for the drive home. They were the perfect road snacks. We spent an afternoon in town checking out a couple shops and restaurants.
Kim was very easy to get in touch with for any questions we had that popped up."

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable, cozy, clean, not cluttered! I had a great stay overall. It was so much more comfortable than a hotel especially after a long day of working and on my feet for 10 hours and having an easy chair to come back to and put my feet up! The host was communicative and also allowed me to check in early after my meeting times were changed.
The only note I would point out is that it is a shared wall with the main house and so you can hear much of what is going on with the family, albeit muffled, sounds were of: voices, moving about, dishes,/cooking, music - the background beat of which got annoying after a couple of hours. (Which means they can also hear your noise too).
It was nice to have the door between the two spaces so while in the ""sitting room"" closing it tamped down the sounds coming from the main house somewhat. It got completely quiet a bit after 10:00, so the noise did not affect my sleep.
The sound level was similar to what you might find at a hotel or apartment."

It was 2 minutes to the rink. It was just my teenage son and myself and the suite was spacious enough for each of us to have our own space along with being able to accommodate his goalie gear laid out every night to dry. The suite was exactly as described and matched the pictures on the listing. Everything was very clean. There was a small amount of noise on the first night (as others have mentioned), but nothing that would be any different from a hotel, actually it was less noisy than a hotel and was very brief. The internet was great. My son brought his gaming computer and had no complaints regarding the WIFI. Woody and Lisa responded right away to any communications/questions I sent during out stay. The neighborhood was quiet, safe and parking was right next to the suite. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed about a week","This was my second pleasant stay at “Sherry’s Suite” in Faribault.
It was very clean and all the furnishings were in excellent shape. The main bed was quite comfortable. I’m fussy about pillows and theirs suited me. The shower worked great but watch the top rail, it’s a bit l lower than I was used to.
Despite not having a full kitchen, I made due with simple breakfasts, pre-made cold salads, sandwiches, etc. just fine. I liked that the apartment had just what I needed but no extra clutter. The view of the woods in the back was a pleasant bonus.
The pre-checkin info emphasized that you can sometimes hear the hosts in the rest of the house and that is true: TV, talking, etc. Things generally quiet down around 10:30pm. But the guest area is private—no usable doors connect the two parts.
The hosts, Lisa and Woody, were friendly, responded quickly to my questions, and readily helped with a request of mine. They have a nice FAQ sheet In the unit that helps a lot."

Stayed a few nights","Sherry’s Suite was exactly as described. It was also very clean, very well maintained, and had everything I needed for my stay. I worked remotely from the AirBnB and the internet was great. The location is quiet and beautiful. Woody and Lisa were extremely responsive and checked in on me a few times during my week-long stay. This is a hidden little gem for SSM parents. I was able to zip over to campus in under five minutes - closer and more comfortable than any hotel in Faribault. All the other parents were jealous of my find! ;)
I look forward to staying here the next time I’m in Faribault."

We aren't used to it because we don't live in an apartment or with other people. However, they weren't really noisy and we weren't woken up with noise during the night. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

Stayed a few nights","“Sherry’s Suite” in Faribault suited my needs quite well. It was very clean and all the furnishings were in excellent shape, practically new. The main bed was comfortable. The sofa bed was pretty comfortable, too, according to my associate. It was nice to have doors on the different sleeping areas for privacy and quiet.
Despite not having a full kitchen, I made due with simple breakfasts, sandwiches, etc. just fine. I liked that the apartment had just what I needed but no extra clutter. The TV, Keurig coffee maker, and toaster worked well. Despite frigid outdoor temps, it was warm inside. The view of the woods in the back was a pleasant bonus.

Stayed one night","Sherry’s Suite is exactly as described. We frequently arrive at MSP late and like a place to stay before driving home to Wisconsin dodging deer at night. Sherry’s Place now joins our other favorite AirBnB!
In addition to the hosts’ description, here are few personal observations:
The location is a bit out of the way from I35 but easy to find (even at night in a snow storm). Our stay was super quiet, the rooms were spotlessly cleaned and the bed was very comfortable. There was plenty of space. The written “User Guide” was clearly organized and complete. Parking was very close to the door. The hosts were attentive (though we did not meet them), checked on us by text and cleaned the snow from the sidewalk shortly before we arrived. We’ll be back."

The ONLY thing that could have been better was the couch bed - it was really a futon, and was leaning/not level so it made it really hard for my two kids to sleep on it. We brought an air mattress and it worked out and I’m glad we did.

Great location!—in a quiet neighborhood but also not far from downtown. We saw deer in the back woods! The space is very clean. Bed and the sofa bed are very comfortable. The hosts are super friendly and communication is easy.

Having fresh eggs right out back was also very nice (& never a peep from the chickens). There is a train that runs near by that goes a couple times during the night, but we are light sleepers & my family down stair never heard it. We would definitely stay again when back to visit."

The appliances are high quality, as are many of the other updates in this home. For our preferences the night-time temperature in the house was a bit warm and we could not control the thermostat because Luke does it remotely. It wasn't that big of a deal and we never mentioned it to him. The other slight difficulty was the driveway. It is as he says in his description but we did not appreciate being monitored by a camera at every in-and-out. Overall, though, it is a great place to stay while in Owatonna and we will stay again."

Stayed one night","Luke’s place was very clean and had everything you would need/expect and more. It had a warm homey feeling and the furniture and bed were comfortable. Bathroom/Shower super clean and very nice. Lovely park across the street. Close to the main hub of town. We went to Foremost Brewing and Torey’s which were both a 5 minute drive away.
I think if I were to say anything remotely considered as negative it would be that you do not have control of the AC/Heat unless you contact Luke, which he lets you know ahead of time. It was a constant 68 while we were there (mid-November) and that was perfect other than being a bit warm for sleeping. Wishing we’d asked for the temp to be turned down for the evening. Not a negative, just something to keep in mind."

Sheets very clean. Coming back in nicer weather to hike and have bonfires would be fun. The Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary was one of the reasons we visited Faribault and had no idea it’d be literally right down the road just about a mile! It was also nice to have a tv w live tv option.!

Stayed with kids","My family traveled up to the area for summer vacation and visits with family. The place was perfect as described. There is a peaceful presence set back in time when staying at this home. My family enjoyed the firepit with hotdogs/ s’mores, bbq, hiking , biking, fishing, playing Monopoly. Bruce was very attentive and loaned us bikes to use during the stay. We slept well and enjoyed our respite here. Great place to “unplug” from the hustle of modern day life- returning to a much simpler version of living so often missed nowadays. Thank you for the memories. We would love to return !"

Stayed with a pet","We(2 adultsand 3 grandkids) thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Grandpa's place. It was our home for the week while my grandson went to hockey camp. It was homey and relaxing and we loved having our dog with us. Our favorite room was the sunroom, we read and learned how to play shut the box board game. The overall comfortable feeling made the week more enjoyable. Highlights were being able to access the hiking trails right at the back of the property and catching fireflies. Bruce is a wonderful host."

This place has everything you need for an indoor or outdoor stay. The extras are definitely thought out, ie; Coffee bar, porch packed with outdoor activity accompaniments, extra chairs and blankets, etc. Very clean.
And if you stay in the winter, that sun room was hard to leave. Watching the sunrise and set w/ the fireplace truly gave me the contentment of being at grandpas.
This will definitely be my go to when I visit the area."

Faribault was a charming little town and we enjoyed being able to visit with our dogs. The home itself is immaculate and offers any and everything you may need while staying there. Bruce was easy to contact and made himself readily available if should need anything."

Stayed with a pet","You would think that one might expect more after a long 3 year wait since our last little vacation that 3 days of mostly rain, with a few peeks at the sun, humid days would be a disappointment. Far from it. This has been, by far, the most relaxing and peaceful and fun vacation we have had…ever! There were enough breaks in the rain for us to enjoy a few walks down the beautiful quiet trails with our Golden Retriever “Winter”. When the rain came down, we enjoyed listening to the rain on the roof and watching the leaves of the trees undulate in the breeze. The light show and rolling thunder from the night time storms were exciting and beautiful!
Now for this little cabin of Grampa’s… about all I can say is “perfection”. I am a vintage dealer, and I lean most towards the styles that bring me memories of my own growing up years. Oh the memories it stirred of my girlhood home in the 1950’s and 1960’s. !.. the pole lamp, the owl clock, the little Mid Century Rocker, the cabinet under the tv to mention just a few. The knotty pine paneling on the Porch room, the narrow board wood floors in the main part of the house and the wonderful midcentury cupboards in the kitchen. Don’t forget to pay attention to that amazing bathroom with the gray and black plastic tiles, the same tiles I remember from my own childhood home. The house / cabin is about the same size as our use, the same efficient use of space. You could raise 5 – 6 kids here… back in the day. It amazes me what people think is necessary these days. Here is the almost hidden treasure I want you all to notice… that chrome covered recessed toothbrush and soap holder in the bathroom right under the medicine cabinet. I had no idea what it was, but Gale is more inclined to test things out, so he pushed on it and there it was! Love it!!!
Thank you, Bruce and family, for the best mini vacation ever."

Bruce has done a great job updating the house without taking away from the “yesteryears vibe”. The location in Faribault is great, especially if you are in town for any of Shattuck St. Mary’s events. However, you are interested in the solitude and needing to unwind, this place will not disappoint! You can engage in walks along the park system directly behind the house as well. The place was clean and definitely well stocked with the essentials! We were able to eat in a few times and had all the comforts of home. Would highly recommend this place!!"

You’ll consider yourself lucky the moment you set foot in this comfortable, well-appointed cottage, with its beautiful location bordering a nature preserve. We were there in the fall, and enjoyed a colorful autumn leaf show. Grandpa’s was spotless and outfitted with everything you can think of — and some amenities that are welcome surprises. We loved discovering the jar of Oreo cookies. A bag of marshmallows awaited us and led to a fun evening around the fire pit. Bruce is a thoughtful, gracious and accommodating host. Communication and check-in were smooth. The location feels secluded, but is actually very convenient. We were looking for a relaxing, serene place to stay. Grandpa’s provided that — and much more!

Stayed a few nights",The place was perfect for our family of 6 and had everything we needed. Jamey and Renae were wonderful hosts. The place was so clean and communication with the hosts was excellent. The place is located outside of town but close enough to a local restaurant or just 1 hour away from Minneapolis. Thanks Jamey for a nice getaway!

Group trip",This is a nice place. Very clean. We had issues while we were there with outlets and appliances and reached out to host and received no response. Very disappointing. The cleanliness and quality of the space and unit is great but the lack of response on important issue left a sour taste in our mouth

Stayed with a pet","Very clean. ~ 1 hr to Minneapolis or Rochester so it makes a great place to stay if you want something peaceful, low key and rural while still having easy access to the cities or Mayo Clinic. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay if you're having surgery at the Mayo Clinic and don't mind a ~45 minute drive to and from through scenic farm fields. That's why we chose it and it worked out great. Also, lots of backyard space for the kids to get outside and play."

Stayed a few nights",Jamey and his wife were extremely hospitable. The loft was in a beautiful and restful location. We stayed to connect with family after my dad’s passing. We were about an hour from family and an hour from the airport which worked out well. Everything was clean and well kept.

Group trip","Stayed her for New Year's Eve weekend with three other friends and we had a BLAST. Great place to relax and it was beyond clean. (seriously, we all walked in and were amazed at how clean it was) By far the best Airbnb I've stayed at and, it's even better than the photos! --We were going to enjoy movies and board games and their table was perfect for gaming AND, the TV there is new and big, unlike the one in the photo -- so that was a nice surprise as well! They had so many kitchen utensils and appliances, unlike any other Airbnb I've stay at. Jamey was excellent at responding and making us feel welcome! If you're contemplating booking this place, I say do it... so cozy, warm and perfect for relaxing :)"

Stayed a few nights","Jamey’s place was better than expected. What a great place to get away from it all, but keep all the modern conveniences! They are minutes from town, yet you feel like you are far away. The kitchen is well stocked and the bathrooms are roomy and super clean. The bed we used is comfortable and living space has tons of natural light and a great flow. The hosts are beyond accommodating, offering help to find our way around and hooking us up with entertainment options. As I listen to the owls at night and watch the deer wander through the woods, I would describe this place as peaceful and serene and a real gem! I highly recommend."
