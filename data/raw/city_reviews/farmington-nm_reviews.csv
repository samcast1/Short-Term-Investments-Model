Stayed with kids","Absolutely beautiful home! Spacious and well maintained. After a long drive from South Dakota, check-in was quick and easy with clear instructions. Calming scents and music greeted us when we arrived. The brochures for local suggestions were superb, and the amenities in the house were very thoughtful. The coffee/tea bar area was well stocked, and the kitchen had all the utensils and dishes we needed (though we didn't actually use the kitchen as much as we'd thought we would- there are many great restaurants located conveniently close).
Hot tub was very relaxing, and the lights on the patio added to the experience. We would absolutely stay here again the next time we're in town!"

We did not get to do much but the home is very beautiful and well taken care of. Kudos to the cleaning crew for having the home sparkle.

Stayed with kids","Casa De Monteagle is a gorgeous and spacious abode with an elegant southwest motif that gave warmth and character to our New Mexico stay. The home is so well maintained and impeccably clean. Fabian goes above and beyond to make your stay inviting and even adds a unique personal touch to details that really makes you feel special. We visited during the winter holiday season and were so surprised to be welcomed with a beautifully decorated home n Christmas tree, which really made it special for the kids. Fabian had everything you could want or need. The home was fully stocked with all the necessities and so much more. There were snacks out which was a blessing after traveling many hours to come in and have snacks ready for the kids. The kitchen, bathrooms, and bedrooms were immaculate. The beds are big, warm, and comfy. The den’s furnishings are arranged for cozy chats and family time around the warm fireplace. The hot tub was lovely treat after a long day. We truly enjoyed our stay!"

Fabians place was well more than I imagined from pictures ans description. We went to move my daughter to Colorado for college. The location was perfect and the home was so warming. He even went out of his way to have flowers, a card and Crumbl cookies waiting for heraas a congratulations gift. There was absolutely NOTHING negative I could say about our stay there. I couldnt get my code access to work and when I called, he answered and had the issue resolved within minutes.
Will most definitely make his home a routine place when I go and see her."

The surroundings were excellent, with unobstructed views of the starry sky, and lots of outdoor space (not to mention seeing the animals)! She was very accommodating, allowed my cat to come with me for the month. Very flexible check in process (we can just let ourselves in). Initially, I was surprised to hear that there is no front door lock/key, however the area is very safe, I learned. Overall, excellent stay, and I would come back."

Just over the bluff was the area I hiked, camped and rode motorcycles with friends for years. Many a day of my childhood was spent in Chockecherry Canyon. The house was just what we needed for the weekend. It was a place of comfort. My dog Sadie was right at home and the roosters were a highlight for me, 100%. Thank you for sharing this ""real"" slice of Farmington with us!!! I cherished every moment I was able to spend at the house and it being Super Bowl weekend made it seem just like the good old days. Thanks, again."

Another thing I loved was the close proximity to hiking trails within a short distance of the house; there is Jackson Lake Trail, Reeds Arch Trail, Road Apple West, and countless other trails nearby. The kitchen has numerous appliances and stocked well with plates, pans, etc. There was ample space in this house. Wish some friends could've come along as there was so much room. Kathy was very responsive to my communications before and during our stay. Cannot wait to stay at Kathy's place again! Thanks again, Kathy for your hospitality!"

Also, it is a ranch, so be mindful that there are animals outside during the night and may disrupt your sleep."

Kathy and Steve were great. They did not leave us out to dry, in fact, they gave us plenty of space to keep each other safe. We talked to each other over fences, text and the app chat. They had everything ready for us before we even arrived so we did not need anything else. This place was a safe haven while we were here. I did not want to stay in a hotel, too many people traveling in and out. My BF and I Brought our dogs with us(scared Colorado might closed their borders) dogs had such a good time and there was a fenced in area for our dogs. We even got to pet the farm animals! If you need to go rent an airbnb, here is your cozy home away from home, that is safe and away from the general public. BLM access so you can even get out on a walk, run, bike ride, etc. ENJOY!!"

My husband was able to train a couple of colts during the day. Town is close, but far enough away to make it very quiet at night. Steve was accommodating and met us there to show us in even after his bedtime. He had the troughs filled up and his horses put away to make room for ours. The place was clean, comfortable and exactly what we wanted. I recommend to anyone wanting to explore the area, then go back cook dinner and watch the sunset on the patio."

Stayed a few nights","While looking for a place close to Durango we stumbled onto this wonderful ranch. First I have to say it's a quick beautiful 35 min drive to Durango with the Aztec area even closer. I cant tell you how sweet and adorable Steve is. Literally he is a true western cowboy straight out of a Louis Dearborn L'Amour Novel. He raises long horn and several different breed of cattle. He showed us the ranch with his cow herding Sheppard. Who went straight to showing off how good a dog he was by herding cows for us. He also showed us his many beautiful horses and burros. Now I come from an equestrian family, 5 generations of horse breeders. And wow right off the bat I was impressed with his horsed. He had a buckskin-dun. I have never seen one. Basically people this is one of true horses of the old West. Next the house. It was big and clean
3 bedrooms and 2 very large showers which after a few hotels stays I am seriously grateful. Now on the listing it says no wifi or TV. He had both there. The wifi was fine for us (simple internet and emailing) TV had 12 channels I swear were better than DirecTV. Kitchen had everything you need and its large. Lots of towels and anything else you need. We slept in the back bedroom the bed was too firm for me but I like super soft beds. But if anyone is like my husband they will love that bed so a heads up on who get the big bedroom. Now this is something I rarely come by in Airbnb. He had to have one of the best washer and dryers I have ever had at an airbnb. It has all the bells and whistles and he even had everything you need for it. So if you want a true western stay I would highly recommend this ranch. We loved it. PS the sunsets and mountains are beautiful there."

However the bed for our #7 person ended up being a shared futon that was barely big enough for one. So she slept on the lounge chair. Other than that, totally worth what we paid and we loved the clean and the well stocked house"

Group trip",QUIET ! I always want a quiet night for sleeping. The property is in an excellent location for resting up while traveling across the desert southwest. We used it as a base for viewing Shiprock and hiking in the Bisti Wilderness. This place was quiet and we slept well. HVAC controls confusing: We like to sleep in a cold environment (about 60 deg F) and found the room temp was too warm for our liking (68 to 70 deg F). We found the HVAC instructions confusing and thus difficult to adjust the temp. We did get one window open to cool down our bedroom. We were well rested for our following day of hiking.

Stayed with kids","It was my second time staying here, and it was again excellent! I used the kitchenette this time, and it was fully stocked with everything needed to make breakfast and to help prepare dinner. I also used the outdoor grill, which was nice to grill up some steaks.
Lisa and Sanky were very friendly and responsive. My daughter played in the backyard, and we all chatted about the Koi pond and how the fish were hibernating.
There was a 6-year-old approved roll-out bed that my daughter slept soundly on for three nights. The main bed was also very comfortable and the bathroom, although very small, was perfect for our needs.
I'll plan to stay here again down the road."

Our son had a restful nights sleep on the rollaway bed, and overall, the room was immaculate!

He walked us to the back because it was dark with a flashlight and showed us everything. The next day we were needing and iron board for my boyfriends shirt and she was quick to respond and left it outside our door since we were out running errands! The last night we were there we ran out of toilet paper at 9:30 pm and she came to our door with another roll! They had snacks, coffee, water, etc. in our room which is something that we’ve never experienced! I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here when traveling to Farmington!🫶🏼"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! My teenage daughter and I had a great time here! We had many wonderful conversations with Sankey about their home, their beautiful fish pond in the back yard, and about why we were there in the first place! We discovered their home was very close to everything we were doing in Farmington! Five minutes up the road to San Juan College, two minutes down the road to Farmington Museum, ten minutes to Lake Farmington, and very close to a variety of shops and restaurants! Lisa provided lots of amenities and we especially loved that there was a freezer in addition to a little fridge. The kitchen has everything you’d need, the bed was warm and comfortable, plenty of closet space/storage, and peaceful atmosphere. Private entrance as well! Our favorite part was the little fish pond with lily pads all over, and enjoying the calming sounds of nature and trickling water. You can’t beat all of that for the price for the room! We will definitely be back on our next adventure in Farmington!"

They have a cute backyard and were eager for us to sit by the fire pit if we wanted to. The bed was super comfortable and so was the roll away. Cute, functional kitchenette.

Stayed about a week","first off, this place was great. Lisa and her husband are so nice but they aren't bugging you all tye time. every once in a while we'd walk out while they are cleaning up the yard and what not. this place was insanely clean and very nicely decorated. it felt very comfortable. the only two things we found very slightly off putting is only because of our personal preferences so it was not even close to being a problem and that was just not being able to control the temp in the room (but that's because this room is attached to their house) and the bed wasn't what it was described as in other reviews. don't get me wrong the bed is great! but we have slept on super plus beds that you sink into for the past 8 years so it was an adjustment is all. but every other thing about this place made these very small things very easy to acclimate to! all in all if we make a trip home to Farmington in the future we will be checking for this place first!! they really are super hosts!!"

Lisa and Sankey were great hosts—helpful and proactive in offering advice/suggestions, but in no way intrusive. Never heard any noise inside the guest suite despite being attached to their home, which made it feel very private inside. Lisa provided many welcoming extras from a basket of goodies to chocolate mints by the bed. Comfy bed and good water pressure in shower (and plenty of hot water). I came from the West and finding the place would have been extremely difficult without a Maps App, but very simple with it. A quick shot to a main road if you come from the East. Plenty of places to eat, buy food and shop within a mile or so in various directions."

We didn’t have a chance to meet Lisa but Sankey was so welcoming and friendly. He offered to help with my bags, made great local recommendations, and was just a delightful soul.
We had the great fortune of being there on a Saturday morning and there was a farmer’s market just down the road with terrific tamales and watermelon juice and lots of veggies. There was also a flee market about 7 minutes away and we found a lot of great things there. There were also loads of garage sales in the neighborhoods around the home. On regular weekdays you’re still within a few minutes of the center which has galleries and museums, thrift and antique stores, and several yummy restaurants. Amazing cultural sites only 18 minutes drive. The best part was that everyone was just so friendly and kind spirited. Our only wish was that we could’ve stayed longer!"

Stayed one night","Lisa's room was one of the best on my road trip this year. It's really nice and big, you finally have room to move around and breathe. The amenities are top notch with a full kitchen. The internet is crazy fast, even when uploading. Lisa and her husband are super friendly. We talked longer in the evening, which was great fun for me. All other AirBnBs have been completely anonymous so far.
I can recommend the accommodation with a clear conscience and would stay there again at any time. A real top address!"

Stayed one night","We enjoyed Lisa's place so much!!!
The pillows were really soft and the bed so comfortable.
The shower was hot and had a good pressure, this is really hard to find this in the US!
It was quiet outside and also inside of the room, no fridge or other thing making weird noise. Everything in the room was fluffy, fluffy carpets, fluffy towels, it felt like home.
We only met Lisa for a few seconds as we arrived quite late but she was really nice with us.
She left additional things in the room like water in the fridge, some food in case we got hungry, nothing was missing.
Perfect stay, we would have stayed more if we had the chance to.
Thanks again Lisa."

Guests will have a private parking spot but it is on dirt. Directions to the room is lit by lights which is helpful if you are checking in after dark. Bed was comfy and surrounded by pillows and soft blanket. Room has a fridge, microwave and a two burner stove. The shower is HOT so be careful. The room can sleep up to three guests -- there is a rollaway bed available if needed. We enjoyed our stay in Farmington. We will definitely stay at Lisa's again when we come back to visit."

Unfortunately, Laurie and I didn't get to meet Lisa, but the hospitality was there. The location is easy to find. The living space was very charming and very clean. The gift basket full of snacks and bottled water was a nice gesture as well. We didn't explore in Farmngton, NM, however, Lisa had a book of fun things to do in the area.

I decided to stay at Lisa's place because of the reviews and it was more than what was promised! The location was amazing, walking distance to multiple stores and restaurants. The street where the house is located is quiet and safe. You have a private entrance. Inside, the bed is VERY comfortable, the room is extremely large, the kitchen area had everything I needed for a one month stay. There is also a private bathroom, shower and small closet where you can hang your clothes.
Lisa and her husband were very kind, welcoming and would check in to see if I needed new towels or anything at all. They provided great recommendations and my husband and I tried fly fishing for the first time based on their recommendations, I highly recommend it! Thank you again Lisa!"

Stayed a few nights","Spent a great week at this renovated, stylish and squeaky clean cottage and highly recommend it as a base for all the greater Farmington area has to offer. Located in a quiet neighborhood just a couple of blocks to the cute downtown and convenient to everywhere in the region you'd want to visit. The cleanliness really stood out, as did the beautiful fully equipped kitchen (lots of spices, oil and other dry goods were available) and one of the very best showers (rain style) I've ever experienced. Loved the European-style windows too. If you are coming in after dark the place can be a bit hard to find as it sits off the street down a gravel driveway, and Google Maps has an incorrect location as well, but Cathy gave specific directions and was very responsive. Overall a great experience and a place I'd want to come back to when my travels take me back here."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay overall at the cottage! Although we experienced some hiccups along the way (no iron upon arrival, the curtain rod in the shower fell down, and the refrigerator went out causing us to lose food, and hair in the shower we cleaned upon arrival), the hosts were very responsive and tended to issues as they came up promptly. When I reached out about the iron, Cathy immediately came over and made a personal delivery with a new iron. When the curtain rod fell, the hosts purchased a new one and delivered it to us same day. The refrigerator was an unfortunate hassle, but they were kind enough to allow us to use their RV refrigerator to save as much food as possible. Aside from the issues (that are highly unlikely to repeat because we were just the unlucky guests they all happened to and they are all now resolved) this place is absolutely amazing and we would go back! The cottage is beautiful inside and the bed is a dream! It was so comfy! The rain shower is unbelievable!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the second unit we have stayed in that is owned by this host, and this experience was just as good as the first. Catherine continues to be very responsive and accomodating, even letting us check in 30 minutes early this time because we arrived ahead of schedule. The unit was furnished sufficiently for our needs, and the dishwasher that is located in this particular unit came in pretty handy since our stay was over the Christmas holiday. The bed in this unit was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on, and that includes those in the multitude of hotels we have stayed in over the years (the only bed we consider more comfortable than this one was in a hotel in Greece)! Just like the other unit, this unit is located in a blissfully quiet area and is within walking distance to a local Safeway. So far, we have no complaints about Catherine's units, and will happily rebook in the future when visiting family in the area."

Great local recommendations. The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, plates, bowls, glasses, etc. which was awesome. My one minor criticism is that the sliding glass door for the bathroom doesn't fully shut at the bottom so privacy is slightly lacking but this wasn't a huge problem for us. Thank you so much Mandy and Bill!"

Stayed a few nights","Simply the best airb&b my wife and I have experienced. Small house divided into two sections, front & back. We stayed in the back, walking past huge rosebushes to a side door with electronic lock. Enter into a snug but intelligently laid out queen bed space opposite the bathroom, leading to the lounging space and kitchen with east facing glass entry to the walled flower-filled courtyard. Compact, but absolutely comfortable for a couple. Little details abound - cubbyholes for water glasses on each side of the bed, tiled surfaces, nooks for personal items. The kitchen is very well equipped (I’m a dedicated cook) - gas stove, decent fridge, nice dishes, and many sweet little edible gifts! I’d consider staying longer just to use this very workable space. Quiet, quiet, quiet - we met the couple staying in front section, but never heard a peep - no footsteps or doors closing. Neighborhood is older small dwellings, no worries about street parking. This was the most spic-and-span place!"

This little snook was created with a lot of love and you can feel it when you stay here. It’s a great place to stay if you’re planning on visiting Shiprock, Bisti Lands, Four Córners Monument and Monument Valley.
The neighborhood is nice and quiet. It is perfect for a couples getaway or a solo trip. There’s plenty of restaurants around and convenience stores to shop from.
It’s an open space, so everything is connected bedroom, living area and kitchen. The host provides towels and amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, sunscreen and an awesome heater to make the bathroom warm.
The living area is so cute and the kitchen comes with everything one might need to cook. There were spices, cooking oils, cleaning supplies, trash bags, and it is well equipped with plates, cups and utensils.
You even have your own little backyard area with a table and a bbq. On the property there is also a laundry room open for use. Would love to stay here again on my next trip."

The cupboards were stocked with spices, oils, hot sauces, and other bonus cooking things we don’t think about when traveling and the coffee bar was great to get our mornings started. The hosts were very friendly and quick to accommodate any needs we had. Definitely would recommend this listing!"

The location is great for accessing all parts of Farmington also. The washer and dryer worked great also. If you have heavy rolling luggage, be prepared to carry it to the back of the building where your unit is (there isn’t a paved or concrete path). (But it’s a wonderful Airbnb and I would very much recommend it!)"

It is a small space but is space planned so well that it feels much larger. To have a full kitchen in such a small space was amazing. The kitchen was also well equipped with anything you could need.We were very comfortable and throughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Mandy and Bill’s to anyone needing an AirBnB in Farmington.

I stay a lot in Airbnb & it is so nice to have things that you use to cook already there. Also lots of tea and of course coffee and they even had flavor enhancers like vanilla and mocha! Yummy! I enjoyed my tea on their wonderful patio in the sunshine.
One of my fav things was that they had hooks to hang up your purse, coat or a hat! I love being able to hang up my robe & jammies! So all in all a wonderful stay with warm & sweet hosts!"

Stayed about a week","Cute little place! We found this on relatively short notice when our plans for Cortez, CO fell thru. Boy are we glad we did! We used Farmington as a base for multiple photography trips to Shiprock, Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness Area and Angel Peak Badlands. The Hideaway is tiny and barely enough room for two people - but fortunately we get along OK and spend a fair amount of time boondocking in a Sprinter van so we're used to close quarters. Despite it's size, it had everything we needed for a week-long stay and we'd definitely stay again!"

The very private patio provides additional space and is charming , it includes a peach tree bearing fruit. The whole place is very private and the neighborhood very quiet.
Mandy and Bill live next door and while they truly respect your privacy they also immediately responded when we needed something. The rental is decorated thoughtfully and with care, it looks like somebody had fun doing it."

If you’re a party of two, be aware that there is no sound insulation when the sliding bathroom door is closed. The bed also amplifies movement, so you may jostle your partner when rolling over. But those are small issues - we loved our stay and would definitely stay here again!
Mandy helped us get a package delivered when we forgot something important at home. We felt very welcome!"

Mandy and Bill have created THE most efficient space I’ve ever seen that is 100% focused on providing comfort. And it definitely accomplishes that. The Airbnb features an amazing private outdoor space with as much square footage as the indoor space. There wasn’t a day I didn’t take advantage of it. The kitchen is stocked with anything you need if you want to cook. You’re also blocks from historic downtown with great food and a local brew pub. Mandy & Bill are the ultimate hosts. I can’t say enough great things about them, this Airbnb and all that the Farmington area has to offer. You’ll just have to discover that yourself."

Stayed over a week","Long review
I stayed here for a month, originally was suppose to stay for my entire 3 month contract but decided after being here for about a week or so to find different housing. Mandy was very timely with responding to my emails and questions as I was a first time Airbnb user. She negotiated a price with me as I requested. She had everything you could possibly need in the hideout . My only problem is , not much privacy . I didn’t realize she lived next door (not that I wanted to party or anything ) also, when I first arrived , which was two days earlier, (she told me to let her know if i came earlier ), she accomodated me. But she kept asking about my payment of the two prior days , which made me feel a lil uncomfortable . On my profile , i mentioned it would be two guests. Apparently she didn’t see that and when I arrived with my fiancé , she quickly said in a passive aggressive tone“ is he staying , I didn’t realize you had a guest “ , That was the first incident that made us feel unwelcoming .Also , the next day or so , we locked the bottom lock instead of using the keyless entry (by mistake) , called Mandy to unlock the door, and she couldn’t find the key, her husband Bill came over very agitated and upset and wasn’t very friendly might I add ,which was appalling to me because that was my very first encounter with him and he didn’t even introduce himself as such . Just made us feel very uncomfortable . That was the reason I chose to find a different rental . Overall it’s a nice place to stay for a little while, but when the heat turns up in New Mexico, the hideaway can be very hot and the air conditioner don’t really cool the place off. I worked nights and couldn’t really sleep in the day due to the heat in the rental . I must admit, after the door incident she did email to check on us and also Bill became a little more friendly ."

It was perfect for me traveling alone with my cat (a nominal pet cleaning fee was quite reasonable, especially because I stayed for almost 2 weeks). There were thoughtful little touches like a basket of spaghetti fixings, coffee and creamer, and a little ice cream in the freezer. The hosts responded quickly to all requests while being patient and easy to communicate with. The laundry room was convenient to use and there was plenty of parking. I would absolutely stay in this thoughtfully furnished and designed tiny house anytime I'm in Farmington."

Stayed over a week","My wife and I stayed for about a month during September and we enjoyed our stay.
The rental is located in a safe, quiet residential neighborhood about ½ mile northeast of historic downtown Farmington. It was extremely clean. There are two rental units (front and rear) at this address which are both owned by Mandy and Bill. We stayed in the rear unit.
The rear unit has three rooms and is about 550 square feet of living space. The bedroom holds a queen bed, a padded storage chest, linens and two small closets. The bathroom has a toilet, vanity, tub/shower, towels and soaps. There is good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The kitchen has everything that you need except a dishwasher or garbage disposal. The kitchen area has a small living area that holds a 2 person sofa, coffee table, floor lamp and a wall mounted television. The television is on cable and has many channels. The wifi/internet has a strong signal and never gave me any problems. The air conditioning kept the unit very comfortable during hot days. The washer and dryer are located in a room between the two rentals and worked perfectly. Entry into the unit is via keypad. There is a rear patio that has table with chairs and a barbecue.
The owners, Mandy and Bill, were very friendly and were quick to help. They live next door but leave you alone so your stay is private.
We recommend this unit for 1 or 2 people and would return for another visit."

Stayed a few nights","Mandy and Bill's cottage was exactly what we were looking for. It served as a great home base for exploring and hiking, and a relaxing setting to start and end each day. They gave us great recommendations for local restaurants, and (if we weren't so lazy) had all the kitchen supplies and a perfect patio for eating in. A cozy home with sweet and thoughtful touches."

It was clean, nicely decorated, comfortable bed, convenient parking and entrance and the hosts were available if we needed anything. We come visit once a year to visit family and we will definitely stay here every time we come! We highly recommend staying here!"

I hope I’m not shooting myself or other travelers in the foot by saying this but I think they may be undercharging for this little gem and above and beyond hospitality! This or the other home they have listed will be the only places we stay when in the Four Corners area!
Mandy and Bill are truly Super Hosts! When we arrived they greeted us with exuberant warmth and wonderful recommendations on where to eat and also told us about a place to see that wasn’t in our plans. We took their recommendation an are very glad we did!
Thank You Bill and Mandy!"

Truly adorable space with smart, versatile, tiny-living details that wow'd us, like an entry-way table that converts to a small dining table (or a desk!) or inset shelves next to either side of the bed with convenient USB and power outlets for our phones. It was relaxing, cozy and comfortable with all the amenities one needs for a short or in our case, a long stay. Would highly recommend!"

Even a wild turkey gave us a show running from the kids in the park and eventually coming over to Ashleigh’s property. Large table that everyone could be seated at too, both inside in the kitchen and out on the deck! The house is located on a hill which gives you great views of the park! A lot of little extras inside too! We will definitely rent it again when we come to Farmington!"

She even provided snacks, water, condiments and brought me a floor fan (I have a noise addiction lol)!

The place was squeaky clean, smelled nice and the layout was open and uncluttered. Furniture was comfy. We didn’t get to try the bed but it was memory foam and I’m sure we would have had a good sleep. Exactly what you see in the photos. TV had free Hulu (and other major providers) which we enjoyed. Superb rental!"

We enjoyed our coffee on the front porch, cooked our meals in the complete kitchen, the bed was comfy, and the shower hot. We have no complaints and will stay again if we’re in the area. We were there to visit Chaco Canyon and Bisti Wilderness. All in all, the trip couldn’t have been better. Thank you Autumn and AirB&B."

The location is halfway between Aztec and Farmington, well away from the main highway, but totally worth the bit of extra drive.
