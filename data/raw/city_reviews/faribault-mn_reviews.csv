Also very nice to have plenty of bathrooms. Kitchen was fully stocked (coffee maker etc) and having Heggies Pizza in the freezer is a great idea.

Group trip","A simply wonderful and fun place to have a group of people. Our son's wedding was in DT Faribault and we had a LOT of family and friends coming from out of the state and country. The house is the former rectory to an old church so it has a plethora of rooms and unique spaces. The updates and remodeling that has been done is sensitive to the original design. The kitchen is wonderful and the outdoor areas were perfect to get our group together. Just a gr8 experience. Thx, Lynn!"

Group trip","A stayed at Lynn's place while we were out for a family reunion. Our extended family of 10 felt right at home and the place was PERFECT. Lynn was proactive and everything was spotless and cozy. Lynn was available, but never intrusive. We felt cared for, but private.
We ended up having a fire in the backyard firepit, cooking in the kitchen and playing games at the big table. Although we had 9 people staying in the house - it was big enough to offer plenty of quiet and privacy if you needed to get a little ""me time"". We did get a little rowdy playing games, but the house was so big and solid, we didn't wake up those that were sleeping. In short, the house could not have been more perfect.
The area was fantastic as well! We walked a few blocks to the farmers market, brew pub, park and charming downtown.
We left with incredible memories and can't thank Lynn enough for sharing her home with us."

Group trip",This house is absolutely perfect. I have stayed overnight in just one room and now have rented the whole house with extended family - 10 people. It is wonderfully roomy. The bedrooms are large and so so quiet. The kitchen is very well-equipped; we baked a cake! We had a barbecue for our daughter’s graduation with about 30 people on the back patio area. It was perfect. Lynn even messaged to see if we would like extra chairs which she brought out for us. I wholeheartedly encourage you to stay here!

We had 3 cars of family who traveled from Wichita, KS to Faribault so my grandpa could be near and see all of his sisters while celebrating his 90th. This was the perfect gathering place and we couldn’t have asked for better weather or location. The rooms were all so cozy, we loved the touches of history, and the kitchen was amazing for cooking meals at the house. It is such a beautiful home and we’ll definitely recommend it to others!"

There were extra blankets, lots of towels, soap and shampoo. Everything was clean and well maintained. We were even lucky enough to have a beautiful day to sit outside in the courtyard and enjoy the fall colors. The location is within walking distance of some good restaurants and a fun downtown area. We would all recommend a stay at the House Next Door."

Group trip","The only thing we was a little disappointed about was in the description of the property it said we would be renting the entire home. But upon arrival we was told that we would have to share the common areas of the home Living room, kitchen and bathrooms And someone would be staying downstairs.. and to top it off, Saturday we was planning on having a barbecue with the team in the backyard and come to find out the backyard was being occupied by a baby shower that was never announced to us during the rental process of this Airbnb.. So this house should be marked as a shared home, not the entire home.."

Group trip","We found that ""The House Next Door"" in Faribault worked well for our gathering over Christmas. We had 8 people staying overnight in the house, and as many as 19 (total) for some of the meals at the house. The house is very spacious, with seating areas in four or five places around the house. The dining room table held eight or ten. We found that we could easily sit and visit without it becoming too noisy in any one place. There were a huge number of Christmas decorations, including outside decorations and two Christmas trees. The kitchen had a dishwasher that was so quiet that we had to put a hand on the front to feel the vibrations, to make certain that it was really operating. The kitchen was well furnished with supplies of all kinds."

Also were not informed the basement tenant shared the kitchen with us. Somewhat awkward to have him show up in the middle of a family gathering or breakfast to cook his meals. Otherwise enjoyed our stay.

Stayed a few nights","I cannot speak highly enough about Kim and her family's tiny house! It was clean, cozy, practical, and full of delight. Kim called once I arrived to check in on me and make some local recommendations. She was very considerate and made the experience feel personalized. The little cabin is a perfect space to retreat and is so full of love and thoughtfulness. Even though neighbors are close, you still get the experience of peaceful solitude. I enjoyed my time reading, relaxing, sitting by the fire, and kayaking on the lake. The tiny house is an exercise in living simply yet having everything you need. The cost is also very reasonable considering the included amenities. (It's outrageous how much it can cost to rent a kayak!) Could not recommend enough."

Stayed a few nights","Best Airbnb experience ever! (and we stay in a lot of them).
Everything about the stay was prefect. More than a Tiny Home, a BIG experience!
My husband and I stayed a couple of days. He enjoyed being able to fish at the lake I enjoyed the paddle boat and relaxing in the hammock.
Though it is a tiny house, it had everything we needed. Decor was so cute and boho. Comfy bed, hot shower with great water pressure.
Kim was an excellent host! The attention was in the details. Loved the little notes throughout the house, The plants, The handmade organic soap! We went to the coffee shop she recommended and did some shopping. She truly made us feel like we were a guest in her home and wanted us to have the best time!
The lake was awesome. Great lake community and beautiful scenery. I'm already planning our next stay!"

Plus the outside space provided adventure to our stay - patio Happy Hours with the fireplace roaring - snow, rain, or sunshine! The diversity and history of Faribault was a wonderful surprise! The bench tour and murals are fantastic.

Kim had excellent recommendations for restaurants in the area and we loved the view from the tiny house. Although the weather was too cold for any lake activity, we still enjoyed the scenery from the shore and hope to come back in the summer. Our favorite local restaurants were Janna’s Market and Grille (the owner was just the sweetest!) and Redemption (such good food and service and the atmosphere was fantastic). Faribault had so much to offer and Owatonna was a great place to scope out as well. Since we came over a holiday weekend, many places of interest were closed, but we plan to return again to see more of the things to do in the area. We highly recommend this terrific tiny house!"

Stayed a few nights","This tiny house exceeded my already high expectations. Cute as a button, very clean, comfortable, gorgeous surroundings and an easy drive to town. The mattress was great, I did not have any back pain or discomfort (a common problem with mattresses when I travel). The shower is awesome: there is a tankless water heater and good water pressure, so if you have long, very thick hair like me, I’m happy to say that you’ll be able to rinse it very well AND not worry about running out of hot water. The natural light is amazing, loved all the plants. I also made good use of the deck and outdoor fire. This was perfect for one person, I plan to return for another me-weekend. Thanks so much to the wonderful host, Kim!"

My husband was able to do some work remotely as a trade off for spending an extra day there. The host was super helpful and friendly. We visited a couple of local breweries, distilleries, restaurants, and parks for hiking and picnics. We also spent plenty of time next to the fire on the deck watching the lake and enjoying nature. Absolutly perfect! We will definitely go again when the weather allowes us to go out on the lake!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a lovely time getting to spend time by myself as a birthday gift. The ride down from the Twin Cities was easy and straightforward with stops by a few shopping areas.
Once you get there, there is a clear parking spot with stairs leading down to the house. The outside space is spacious and includes the area down to the left, the yellow dock. The tiny home itself is easy to access. It was easy to cook and clean with the given utensils and supplies. Surprisingly the bathroom doesn’t feel that small. I really enjoyed the loft area and since I am short, was able to sit up with plenty of head space. I loved being able to read in the hammock with its view of the lake and when it got dark, stargazing. Overall, I enjoyed my time alone with this tiny home.
Kim, the lovely host gives recommendations for additional activities in the area. She’s quick to respond and easy to talk to.
I had a lovely time and would definitely recommend."

The tiny house itself is wonderfully set up, cozy, and had everything we needed. The large deck with a fire pit, lounge chairs and a grill was excellent for relaxing and being outside—as were the swinging bench and hammock. We used the pedal boat and kayaks and had an amazing time on the lake. Kim was a lovely host, and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. She had wonderful recommendations and was extremely kind and responsive. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a charming getaway!"

Great location, feels peaceful and private but also close to town and hiking. We didn’t get a chance to go out on the water, but kayaks and a paddle boat were available. Tiny house was very clean and had everything we needed, and also a very nice outdoor space. Spent most of our time out there, especially in the evenings. Host was amazing and attentive. Had an awesome and relaxing mini-getaway.

Had everything I needed to enjoy my stay to the fullest. The lake was not very busy, so sitting on the deck enjoying the view and reading was the bulk of how I spent my time. However, the location is only 5 minutes from town if you want to shop, eat and/or be social. The tiny house was cozy and comfortable, both inside and out. Kim was warm, welcoming and quick to respond if I had questions. Definitely planning to come back again next year!!"

Stayed a few nights","Kim’s tiny home was truly a magical experience for my partner and I. It’s secluded on the lake just enough for privacy but we also felt safe being within a neighborhood. The tiny looked just like the pictures, clean and beautifully decorated, and truthfully as taller people we had way more room than expected! The loft was super cute and the bed was so comfy, having the TV just above the bed made us feel so spoiled😂 Our visit was in July so the heat and humidity were high, but the AC in the tiny home worked amazing and things cooled off overnight. We sat out every night on the giant deck and used the gorgeous fire pit (wood provided!). It was SUCH a peaceful getaway. Having our own dock on the lake and paddle boat was incredibly fun as well! The home was beyond gorgeous and Kim really thought of everything one could need and was super responsive to any questions we had. We felt like we were in our own little fairy house, I would recommend to anyone looking for a unique getaway!"

The kitchen outlooks over a beautiful lake which you have full access to. Kim went above and beyond to make me feel welcomed. She likes to greet her guests and gives great local recommendations. Communication with Kim was easy and she responds right away.
The inside is equipped with everything you need for a relaxing vacation. The personal touches around the tiny home are very thoughtful and all the plants make the space feel much larger than it is. The outdoor space has everything from a large deck, lounge chairs, hammock, grill, kayaks, paddle boat, and dock into the lake.
I would recommend this place to solo travelers, couples, or anyone looking for some time to relax for a few days on the water. I hope to be back some day! Thank you for a wonderful stay! ☺️☺️"

The house is AMAZING! You have to see it and experience it to appreciate it! Kim and her family have literally thought of everything and packaged everything into a small space! All the decorations are darling and artistic. Be sure to check out their story in the book ""Turning Tiny"" -- SOO inspiring!! The location is perfect - secluded but with a big patio and looking right out on the lake! The weather was perfect and the lake so fun!! You'll have an amazing time and be inspired by the simplicity and connection to nature! We had a WONDERFUL stay!!"

They were constantly walking right through the property, luckily not during our ceremony! I can handle a little noise but at one point when we were sitting on the deck, someone walked over took a leak about 20ft away from us. We’d still come back, just maybe on a week day instead!"

She had great suggestions for us, and we had a fabulous getaway weekend. Waking up to have coffee and overlooking the lake was ideal. The Tiny House has so many special touches to make this stay unique. Close to restaurants if you want a town-experience, or just stay put, nap in the hammock, go kayaking, rest and rejuvenate."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay! Kim was a wonderful host, she arrived shortly after we did to welcome us and show us around. I loved all of the details, such as lights around the house at night, multiple seating areas on different levels, eco friendly hand & dish soap, notes around the house, a small wren house with baby birds. We loved kayaking and tried the paddle boat. My favorite was early in the morning sitting either out on the dock steps or by the fire pit with a cup of coffee or hearing the rain out the loft window at night. We brought our bikes for the Sakatah trail, rode 25 miles, came back and fell asleep on the hammock. Couldn't have wished for any better of a time."

Tiny was the perfect size for my husband and I. Kim gave us several recommendations and was spot on with them all. When we walked in there was a nice welcoming personalized note from her and her family. Prior to coming and during, we never waited more than 15 minutes for a response to messages, often times it being within minutes.

Stayed a few nights","This tiny house is something very special. Kim and her family have put such thoughtful touches throughout the space, making it so warm and cozy. The home offers a beautiful view of the lake and is a great spot to watch both the sunrise and sunset. Kim was very considerate of our time and space, and was extremely responsive starting from the time we made our reservation to the end of our stay, helping us immediately address any concerns we had. The reading nook was so cozy, and the leisure loft was stocked with fun activities to keep us occupied. If you're willing to brave the winter weather, you can enjoy a nice fire out on the deck. If you're planning on cooking, the kitchen is stocked with the essential tools (one thing to keep in mind is that there's a small toaster oven, not a full-size oven, if that's something you need). Overall, a wonderful space to relax."

Stayed a few nights","This was our first time ever using Air BnB and this was the best experience we could have ever had! The space was beautifully designed with so many personal touches. I loved the aromatherapy diffuser, pillows in the leisure loft, and homemade hand soap. The location was absolutely divine right on the water. We went just as the lake was freezing over so it was fun to watch it freeze a bit more each day. We grilled every night on the gas grill and made fires in fire pit when the wind allowed. We brought an entire thanksgiving dinner (turkey breast, potatoes, sweet potatoes, stuffing,gravey) and it all fit in the mini fridge. I’m glad I pre-cooked though because there are a total of 3 burners (counting the bonus one attached to the grill) so cooking that much from scratch would have been challenging to time. We were initially nervous about how much hot water there would be, but were pleasantly surprised that there was more than enough for two consecutive showers. The space was perfect for the two of us (medium sized adults) but I could see it being a bit too small for a group larger than two. Just an FYI, for those who might have mobility challenges, doing stairs is absolutely necessary to access the houses. The only way to access the loft is by ladder, and the only way to get to the leisure loft is to crawl along a “hallway” on hands and knees. We loved the adventure and the space!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Where do I begin…what an amazing tiny home and equally amazing family hosting it! Booking this home was easy and Kim did an excellent job communicating before, during, and after the stay. Upon our arrival to the tiny home after a long day at work, Kim had made a special trip to the tiny home to turn on the heat and some lights!! Extremely welcoming host and space. The next morning, Kim stopped by following our welcome to say hello! Our stay at this tiny house was in celebration of our 2nd wedding anniversary, 5 years together. My husband also dreams of building a tiny house of our own! Kim was wonderful about answering my husband’s many tiny house questions. Hearing her first hand experience and what they have learned was priceless. Kim also gave us lots of great recommendations for food and fun in the area. The tiny house is a warm, cozy space full of natural wood, bright colors, and beautiful house plants. The attention of detail is splendid. Little things like the tiny fan in the loft where you sleep and soaps & q-tips in the bathroom made our stay ideal. Only trick is no oven (there is a small toaster oven) so we ended up making lasagna on the wonderful grill that is provided. Wood and fire pit are also provided. The mattress in the loft was surprisingly comfortable! The tiny house is surrounded by a beautiful deck overlooking the lake. We didn’t want to leave and hope to be back! Bless this Tiny House!!"

The furnishings, amenities, toiletries, and overall design makes the stay effortless, cozy, and comfortable. There were even things I never knew I needed (**the cute little fan in the loft**). We especially enjoyed all of wonderful little design elements that kept us looking and interested every day; trinkets, books, little notes, plants, blankets, cute curtains, vintage light bulbs, the list goes on. The outdoor spaces and accommodations are beautiful and functional, and the sunsets on the lake are beautiful. The location is fantastic. Easy and fast access to Faribault, Northfield, and Owatonna, all with extraordinary history, shopping, dining, and attractions/destinations. Truly a hidden gem.

Stayed a few nights","The tiny house was GREAT! I am a stickler for cleanliness and this place was extremely clean. It also is better esthetically than the photos which is hard to imagine possible. SO beautiful. There were also a lot of touches that went above and beyond expectation (ie: a Polaroid camera for you to use, complimentary soda waters, bug spray wipes, grilling equipment, a French press, etc). There was also extra care for comfort that I think comes from the hosts previously living there (ie: fan in the loft, reading light, extra pillows etc).
The only things I would be aware of next time is the location itself. Everything was closed Monday-Wednesday (making our Monday-Wednesday stay a little rough to find things to do) I also would be advised that the lake truly is at this time of year (end of July) so thick with moss getting in wasn’t really an option."

We were there for an unplugged couple’s getaway. We spent lots of time in the lounge chairs enjoying the view of the lake and watching the boats. We also played many card games on the deck.
We highly suggest Crack of Dawn Bakehouse for breakfast. We also grabbed some donuts at Roberd’s Resort for the drive home. They were the perfect road snacks. We spent an afternoon in town checking out a couple shops and restaurants.

Definitely kept them entertained, they went above and beyond providing an extra table and seats for us and dishes. Very nice and very appreciative. Only thing was there was a lot of light switches and trying to figure out what rooms they went to and how to turn on lol but honestly wasn’t a big issue after a few days of getting used to the place. We definitely loved our stay and would come back again!"

While we didn't have any kids, they do provide books and games for young ones as well as air hockey and foseball. They also have so many blankets around to cuddle up in, although the thermostat is really easy to use, but sometimes blankets are comfier..
All of us adored it and would definitely recommend."

It was great to have a ping pong table in the basement for some competitive fun! The bedrooms were nice and mattresses very comfortable. The upstairs bathroom very nice with only a tub but the downstairs bathroom did have a shower. The Arch House felt like our home away from home.

Stayed a few nights","1000 characters is simply not enough space to share how amazingly wonderful this stay is. Let's start with the basics: the bed was luxuriously comfortable, the wifi was fast and reliable, kitchen was organized and well-stocked with pantry basics. The house was pristine. Everything was well organized and spotless. Check in and out was incredibly smooth. No crazy cleaning tasks.
In terms of entertainment and amenities, there were so many things we didn't even have time to use! There was space for a toddler to explore, board games, and even a S'mores kit! We'll definitely be back in the summer to check out the backyard and firepit.
In general, this space felt like an homage to the local community. There were lots of amazing little details, and notes from Mario and Emily. They highlighted local authors, coffee shops, and even had a local hot sauce in the fridge! The little details were always a wonderful surprise (also, great coffee).
Terrific stay - probably our best AirBnB experienc"

Stayed about a week","Spent a little over a week at the Arch house and it was great stay!!
Loved that the kitchen was equipped with not only all the cooking supplies but also spices, flour, sugar etc. so there was no need to buy all those “little extras” for the cooking.
Loved all the “welcome” gifts and notes. Great location for me and internet was great so I could remote into work while there.
Mario was great at responding and helping out with instruction so it was easy to check in and find the property. It was very cold during the week, but the house kept nice and warm despite the negative degrees outside:-). Did not have to change the thermostat at all.
Will definitely come back when I have a longer stay planned again:-)"

Stayed with a pet","We needed a place near Northfield that accepted pets and this place fit the bill. The cabin is close to a campsite and has few amenities. No salt, pepper, coffee, oil, hand soap, etc that you might find elsewhere. We were there for Labor Day weekend and the bugs were fierce. The outdoor light (that we could not switch off) was above the entrance, which meant tons of bugs would whoosh in every time we opened the door at night. The checkout instructions asked us to clean, dust, vacuum, etc. which would’ve been ok except we woke to a carpet of dead bugs every morning. Beautiful area, friendly neighbors and locals. We would stay again."

Sheets very clean. Coming back in nicer weather to hike and have bonfires would be fun. The Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary was one of the reasons we visited Faribault and had no idea it’d be literally right down the road just about a mile! It was also nice to have a tv w live tv option.!

We loved the lovely 4 season porch, great for sunrise and morning coffee. We felt that it is time to update some of the older living and dining room furniture for ease of hanging out together comfortably, for 5 adults. Otherwise we love the amazingly well stocked kitchen, and obvious sentimentality of this sweet place."

This place has everything you need for an indoor or outdoor stay. The extras are definitely thought out, ie; Coffee bar, porch packed with outdoor activity accompaniments, extra chairs and blankets, etc. Very clean.
And if you stay in the winter, that sun room was hard to leave. Watching the sunrise and set w/ the fireplace truly gave me the contentment of being at grandpas.
This will definitely be my go to when I visit the area."

Faribault was a charming little town and we enjoyed being able to visit with our dogs. The home itself is immaculate and offers any and everything you may need while staying there. Bruce was easy to contact and made himself readily available if should need anything."

Stayed with a pet","You would think that one might expect more after a long 3 year wait since our last little vacation that 3 days of mostly rain, with a few peeks at the sun, humid days would be a disappointment. Far from it. This has been, by far, the most relaxing and peaceful and fun vacation we have had…ever! There were enough breaks in the rain for us to enjoy a few walks down the beautiful quiet trails with our Golden Retriever “Winter”. When the rain came down, we enjoyed listening to the rain on the roof and watching the leaves of the trees undulate in the breeze. The light show and rolling thunder from the night time storms were exciting and beautiful!
Now for this little cabin of Grampa’s… about all I can say is “perfection”. I am a vintage dealer, and I lean most towards the styles that bring me memories of my own growing up years. Oh the memories it stirred of my girlhood home in the 1950’s and 1960’s. !.. the pole lamp, the owl clock, the little Mid Century Rocker, the cabinet under the tv to mention just a few. The knotty pine paneling on the Porch room, the narrow board wood floors in the main part of the house and the wonderful midcentury cupboards in the kitchen. Don’t forget to pay attention to that amazing bathroom with the gray and black plastic tiles, the same tiles I remember from my own childhood home. The house / cabin is about the same size as our use, the same efficient use of space. You could raise 5 – 6 kids here… back in the day. It amazes me what people think is necessary these days. Here is the almost hidden treasure I want you all to notice… that chrome covered recessed toothbrush and soap holder in the bathroom right under the medicine cabinet. I had no idea what it was, but Gale is more inclined to test things out, so he pushed on it and there it was! Love it!!!
Thank you, Bruce and family, for the best mini vacation ever."

However, you are interested in the solitude and needing to unwind, this place will not disappoint! You can engage in walks along the park system directly behind the house as well.

We took the trail from the yard to the nature preserve for a morning walk and it was beautiful. For those traveling with kids, there's a booster seat, a high chair, and a pack and play if needed (we brought our own so we didn't use them). Location is quiet but a quick drive to various restaurants and stores in Faribault. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Bruce!!"

You’ll consider yourself lucky the moment you set foot in this comfortable, well-appointed cottage, with its beautiful location bordering a nature preserve. We were there in the fall, and enjoyed a colorful autumn leaf show. Grandpa’s was spotless and outfitted with everything you can think of — and some amenities that are welcome surprises. We loved discovering the jar of Oreo cookies. A bag of marshmallows awaited us and led to a fun evening around the fire pit. Bruce is a thoughtful, gracious and accommodating host. Communication and check-in were smooth. The location feels secluded, but is actually very convenient. We were looking for a relaxing, serene place to stay. Grandpa’s provided that — and much more!

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable, cozy, clean, not cluttered! I had a great stay overall. It was so much more comfortable than a hotel especially after a long day of working and on my feet for 10 hours and having an easy chair to come back to and put my feet up! The host was communicative and also allowed me to check in early after my meeting times were changed.
The only note I would point out is that it is a shared wall with the main house and so you can hear much of what is going on with the family, albeit muffled, sounds were of: voices, moving about, dishes,/cooking, music - the background beat of which got annoying after a couple of hours. (Which means they can also hear your noise too).
It was nice to have the door between the two spaces so while in the ""sitting room"" closing it tamped down the sounds coming from the main house somewhat. It got completely quiet a bit after 10:00, so the noise did not affect my sleep.
The sound level was similar to what you might find at a hotel or apartment."

1) Arriving at night as we were it was a bit difficult to see where the house numbers were so perhaps a more prominent/better lit display of your house number would be helpful.
2) A subscription to one of the pay services like Netflix instead of Dish would be preferred.
3) Thermostat control of the space. We felt comfortable but others may not."

Stayed with kids","My son attended a hockey camp at Shattuck St. Mary's for the week and everything about Sherry's Suite was perfect for our trip. Location couldn't be beat. It was 2 minutes to the rink. It was just my teenage son and myself and the suite was spacious enough for each of us to have our own space along with being able to accommodate his goalie gear laid out every night to dry. The suite was exactly as described and matched the pictures on the listing. Everything was very clean. There was a small amount of noise on the first night (as others have mentioned), but nothing that would be any different from a hotel, actually it was less noisy than a hotel and was very brief. The internet was great. My son brought his gaming computer and had no complaints regarding the WIFI. Woody and Lisa responded right away to any communications/questions I sent during out stay. The neighborhood was quiet, safe and parking was right next to the suite. We would definitely stay here again!"

They do have a dog that woke me up barking a few times, and there is no temperature control in the suite (but you can send them a message if you want them to adjust it from the main house)...two small negatives for an otherwise very positive experience!"

Stayed about a week","This was my second pleasant stay at “Sherry’s Suite” in Faribault.
It was very clean and all the furnishings were in excellent shape. The main bed was quite comfortable. I’m fussy about pillows and theirs suited me. The shower worked great but watch the top rail, it’s a bit l lower than I was used to.
Despite not having a full kitchen, I made due with simple breakfasts, pre-made cold salads, sandwiches, etc. just fine. I liked that the apartment had just what I needed but no extra clutter. The view of the woods in the back was a pleasant bonus.
The pre-checkin info emphasized that you can sometimes hear the hosts in the rest of the house and that is true: TV, talking, etc. Things generally quiet down around 10:30pm. But the guest area is private—no usable doors connect the two parts.
The hosts, Lisa and Woody, were friendly, responded quickly to my questions, and readily helped with a request of mine. They have a nice FAQ sheet In the unit that helps a lot."

In addition to the hosts’ description, here are few personal observations:
The location is a bit out of the way from I35 but easy to find (even at night in a snow storm). Our stay was super quiet, the rooms were spotlessly cleaned and the bed was very comfortable. There was plenty of space. The written “User Guide” was clearly organized and complete. Parking was very close to the door. The hosts were attentive (though we did not meet them), checked on us by text and cleaned the snow from the sidewalk shortly before we arrived. We’ll be back."

The ONLY thing that could have been better was the couch bed - it was really a futon, and was leaning/not level so it made it really hard for my two kids to sleep on it. We brought an air mattress and it worked out and I’m glad we did.

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Joanne's place was peaceful and enjoyable. I can only imagine what it's like during the summer and fall. We dared our sons to jump in the lake which they did! I watched the sunrise from the kitchen window with my morning tea and it was spectacular. The house is a duplex, so we were right next to Joanne. With two teenage boys, one of whom walks pretty heavily, I was worried about the noise, but it all seemed okay. The space itself was nicely decorated, clean and very well appointed with all necessary comforts. We only needed to shop for a few food items. It was nice to have our own bedrooms and the beds were some of the most comfortable we have had at an AirBnB. We had a snafu with getting locked out but Joanne was quick to respond. As newcomers to the area, we were not aware of all the gravel roads. My husband is a car guy so it really bothered him getting in and out to the property, most wouldn't worry, I just mention it for anyone who might consider that an issue."

Stayed about a week","We had a great time.
The space is spacious, cozy, and very clean. It has all the amenities you need for the stay. The location of the house is beautiful with a view of the French lake. When you get up in the morning you can see the sunrise on the Lake, it's splendid.
Our two teenagers had their own space on the ground floor, they loved it. There is also everything you need to do laundry and dry laundry. We are French and were in Faribault to spend Christmas with our son who studied at the University of Mankato and we had great holidays with family. I recommend Joanne's place."

The big kids appreciated the comfy beds, the quality towels and and very well equipped kitchen! The view out the windows onto the lake was a real treat for everyone. We'll be back in the Spring to check out the lake.
Thanks, Joanne!"

Group trip","My girlfriends and I had a wonderful ""ladies weekend"" at Joanne's place. It's location on the lake is beautiful and offered views throughout the 2 level duplex home. Plenty of parking, easy access and we founf Joanne to be very accommodating and helpful. She even had farm fresh eggs for us in the fridge!
The bedrooms were adequate and clean. There were fresh sheets and towels. The bathroom downstairs is a little dated but clean. The master on the main level and bathroom were the best rooms. The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom was also clean. The kitchen is open and had great utensils and cookware. The location is good, however getting there is on a dirt road and it's a little dark in the evening. Faribault restaurants are about 15 min. away. My group was very satisfied with our stay and accommodations and we would not hesitate to come back or recommend."

We chose this location because it was peaceful and quiet, and we looked forward to sitting around a fire by the lake after dinner. It was everything we’d hoped it would be. Clean, easy to get to, remote enough to be quiet, close enough to town to visit shops, breweries, and restaurants. We enjoyed s‘mores by the fire, and taking in the beautiful moon and the stars glistening off of the lake. Truly a wonderful weekend catching up with a dear friend at a beautiful Airbnb! Thanks, Joanne!"

Much time spent on the upper deck with a glass of wine listening to geese and welcome lake sounds. I was serenaded by an owl one evening. Cool! This location was convenient for me to visit old friends in my home state. We enjoyed hiking at the River Bend Nature Center and had a terrific breakfast at Janna's Market Grill in Faribault. Joanne is a great host. I appreciated the fact that she provided all required information concisely and didn't overwhelm me with too many unnecessary details. Perfect."

Stayed with kids","Lovely spot--super clean and peaceful and very well maintained and appointed. Everything very easy to find and in good repair, no poking around in scary basements, etc. Kitchen had everything we needed and a nice coffee selection to boot. Just had that nice vibe of a host who cares about her guests being comfortable. The inside layout and deck spaces work well for a group, and we comfortably slept six (one adult and five kids) with room to spare. I brought my daughter and her friends and they had a blast on the big inflatable in the water. The upstairs/downstairs bedroom arrangement is especially nice if you have adults and tweens who keep different hours. Would definitely come back with my family for some kayaking and swimming in the deeper water, too. There are a lot of stairs to the water so heads up for anyone with mobility issues, but the shoreline is sandy and very nice and clean. I'm only sorry we didn't bring marshmallows for the fire pit! Definitely recommend."

This place is extremely family friendly, had more than enough beds for all of us. I’d say for a night or two on the lake, this will fit your needs! Thank you, Joni!"

The home is located close to a Winery too, which was the perfect end to a day of floating on the Lake!
The only cons would be all the stairs down to the lake, so make sure you have everything you need before heading down! Also, we didn’t love the weeds in the lake near shore, but we just wore water shoes and got in at the end of the long docks and hopped on our floaty!
Book this BEAUTIFUL Lake home! You won’t regret it!"

Having kayaks provided was nice as well! The water wasn’t swimmable the couple days we were there but cleared up as we were leaving. The house was a duplex- not a problem at all, all was quiet and there were privacy barriers. The only minor problem we noticed was a slight odor throughout the house. The large kitchen was great, and there were several gathering places where we could spread out comfortably with 8 people and not be in each others’ hair! We felt that the price was very reasonable compared to nearby cabins/houses and are glad we stumbled upon this property!"

The bathrooms had extra towels and necessities. My family and I packed the bare minimum and with Natalka’s thoughtful hospitality, we didn’t feel like we forgot anything at home at all. The best part about this cabin was the magical sunset views. The unobstructed beauty is literally right outside the cabin and over the lake. You can’t help but stop and absorb its radiance. As others mentioned, there’s a road between the cabin and access to the dock/lake. It’s a smaller road with speed limit of 25 mph. Plenty of cars drove by but not enough to take away the serenity or feel that it was dangerous for my young children. The lake was rocky & had green algae when we were there so we didn’t swim but we did go across the lake to a sandy resort recommended by Natalka and swam there. We really loved this cabin and will be back for sure!"

Clean, comfortable and jammed-packed a lot of extras that you didn’t even know you’d want from an Airbnb rental. Fantastic value and great communications, we hope to visit again.
*small note rental is located on a busier bend of road, if traveling with children be mindful of them crossing street from lake dock/fire pit are to driveway/house. Overall traffic moves slower around lake and drivers accommodate pedestrians, but sometimes littles can be hard to spot."

The choice of indoor, four-season porch or outdoor deck (both overlooking the lake) offered great bird watching and lake watching. One small mention is that the road does pass between the cabin and the lake, though there is a private shoreline and dock. Hard to tell that detail from the photos. Very much enjoyed our long weekend at the lake."

Stayed a few nights","This place was exceptional and deserves strong 5 stars!
We were staying at Kristy BoatHouse for 3 nights. The place is really close to both: Northfield and Faribault, but it is located on the beautiful small lake in a private and very cozy Neiborhood.
The first impression was that it was brand new: inside the house was so clean and beautiful, like we were the first visitors there. Everything crystally clean, nice furniture, a lot of board games. Kitchen is fully equipped, including what you might need for a dog. Fresh duck and chicken eggs was a great surprise!
The lake view is wonderful, very quiet, very comfortable bed, clean restroom. Our requests ware responded immediately. Kristy and Casey are great hosts.
There is a long bike trail nearby and I even found a place for rollerblading.
At our last day Kristy even let us to do a late check out and use kayaks for the last time!"

They provided more amenities than was posted on their site! The kitchen was well stocked with condiments and other things that a family might need or use for cooking.
They even allow us to host a dinner for my daughter’s friends at school and joined us for dinner. The homemade venison sausage was treat and gave us more to take it back home!

We spent a long labor day weekend at the boathouse - binged watched some shows on netflix, went into a couple of nearby towns for food and groceries, and just felt right at home. Other residents around the lake had a bonfire and invited us to join them so we did. We saw the sun rise and set on the lake and star gazed. It was breathtakingly beautiful.
We love Kristy and Casey - we bugged them a lot and they treated us like family. We had forgotten a few things and they accommodated for us. They took us out on their pontoon for both swimming and fishing! We were shown different t fishing techniques we didn’t know about. We had an amazing weekend and will definitely return!"

Since we came at night direct from the airport, i was extremely grateful to find drinks, snacks, and a loving house cat, Marley, to wind down our evening with. There is so much to look at and enjoy, especially if you've been following Furball Farm for a while. The house is very clean and very well stocked with kitchen items if you want to cook meals. Very cozy and charming. Absolutely no issues, and based on responsiveness, if there had been something come up, im confident it would be resolved quickly. Loved having the sanctuary live on the tv so we could watch the furballs when we weren't in the sanctuary."

It was peaceful and quiet with just enough activity to not feel isolating. We came expressly to see the cats, plus our cat-host Marley was a real character and added enjoyment to our stay. It's a good feeling to know part of the cost of our stay will be donated to helping the cats in the sanctuary. The volunteers were friendly and we saw how hard they worked to make the sanctuary comfortable for the cats and also for the staff. We felt like this was our home away from home. We loved seeing the cat themed memorabilia around the house. We also appreciated that Faribault is less than 35 minutes from the Minneapolis area which we also visited. Thank you once again for making our first Air B&B experience one to remember."

We loved our stay at Furball Farm. The house was exceptionally clean, modern, well organized and had so many unique touches. It was so relaxing and private.
The house is nicely renovated and spacious, we were really impressed at all the details that made for a fun and comfortable stay.
Marley the resident cat is the friendliest feline host and made for a lovely house companion. It is nice to have his purrs and cuddles while watching TV or reading books.
The best perk was being able to visit the cat sanctuary outside of visitor hours and having dedicated time with all the kitties. We soaked up lots of time with the cats and chatted with the friendly volunteers.
Thank you for a fantastic stay at Furball Farm! And kudos to all the incredible hardworking volunteers. We had a blast and cannot wait to return!"

Located on the property of the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary, you have easy access visit the Furballs when you want and even volunteer to help clean. The Farmhouse has been updated, is clean and quiet at night and even comes with its own in-house kitty Marley should you choose to have him stay with you. The property is out of town and is surrounded by trees and open fields. The trees were just staring to turn beautiful Fall colours. We had a wonderful time with Julie and all the volunteers. Everyone was very helpful and kind. We are so grateful we had the opportunity to stay in this lovely Farmhouse, visit the kitties and meet the wonderful volunteers.

Group trip","My Mother turned me on to Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary...and when they opened their airbnb, my mother was all about making a trip, motivating us to join her. She and my aunt drove from Illinois, and I flew in from Denver, to meet them. There was not one thing we were without during our stay. The airbnb is stocked well, had everything we needed, and is of course a wonderful option to visit, as a bucket list trip. Marley, the resident cat, is a great host...along with the other cats that hang about outside, and greet you. I highly recommend staying at the airbnb, for the total and complete ""Furball"" experience. We are already working towards our next trip...and will be back soon. Everything needed is in close distance, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, etc. We enjoyed Carbones (lunch buffet was yummy) and the Crooked Pint Ale House. Many thanks to all, for a very memorable experience."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful, peaceful farmhouse next to the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary. If you love cats, this is a must. If you want to understand rescue and the needs of feral cats, this is a must. Wonderful people."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb Farm House is a MUST for all cat lovers! Not only is it clean, modern, spacious, and comfortable, it is ""steps"" away from the cat sancuarty. It is so uniquely decorated for anyone needing a dose of cat decor! Julie is the most amazing host... friendly, kind, personable, attentive, and respectful. I can't tell you how ""at home"" I felt, with easy access by keypad, free wifi, privacy, very peaceful at night, tons of lighted security, and has a beautiful view of cats and the sanctuary below.
I can't wait to go back there and I highly recommend this awesome place to stay. Thank you SO MUCH, Julie. You are absolutely the best!

Stayed a few nights","I loved the Furball Farm Inn. I had a fantastic stay. The house is comfortable and complete. Marley the host cat made my stay 10x more enjoyable. If you’re looking for a relaxing retreat and you love cats, this is a must place to stay. I’m planned my trip from North Carolina with the sole purpose of experiencing the cat sanctuary and walked away with precious memories. I plan to return yearly! Thank you Kris, Janis and Julie. Thank you volunteers for being welcoming and friendly."

Stayed one night","This Airbnb was wonderful. We loved visiting the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary across the parking lot. Marley, the cat was a great host, very friendly and was quite talkative. Marley enjoyed sitting in our laps. The location was quiet, peaceful and beautiful. It was a short trip into town to eat. We especially liked The Depot.
We would love to return for a longer visit in the future."

Stayed with kids","We had the best time staying and visiting with with all the kitties at the sanctuary each day. Extended hours for our visits were such a treat! Marley our housecat ensured our time between santuary visits did not go without plenty of kitty cuddles. The house was clean and so comfortable, plus peaceful and private. The hosts were very kind, attentive and helpful. I just can't say enough about what a wonderful experience we enjoyed!"

Stayed one night","If you love cats, then this is a must bucket list item. The house was exactly the way the pictures showed. Given the temps were close to 100, we were grateful for the air conditioning. Nice and cool. The previous customers even left some goodies in the refrigerator. I nice assortment of snacks were available for us on the counter. Beds are so very comfortable. We highly recommend the Furballfarm Cat Sanctuary Airbnb. Julie, Kris and all the volunteers made us feel right at home. And a perk for staying right on the grounds, you get to visit the kitties after the normal visiting hours. You will not regret booking this Airbnb 😻😺😽

Group trip","Our family has always said ""the purrfect Airbnb experience would include a cat,"" and this one included the most amazing cuddler named Marley plus another 350 of them that we could visit just a few steps away! Heaven! The house was spotless, adorable, spacious, and as comfortable as home. Everyone in the sanctuary made us feel welcome. Thanks for having us, we look forward to returning! A truly therapeutic and memorable experience for us."

Stayed a few nights","This was an AMAZING experience. And if you love cats, you must put Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary as a must do experience on your bucket list. I learned so much about feral cats, their care, and why places like this sanctuary are needed and we all must spay and neuter stray cats. The house is quiet, bright, and includes thoughtful amenities in case you forgot something, as well as delightful surprises related to the cats they care for—pictures, books, puzzles. When you rent, you get a few extra hours with the cats beyond visiting hours, and I came to volunteer which was THE BEST so I was able to really experience a few full days. I can’t say enough good things about the Furball Farm Cat Sanctuary and the people who staff it."

Stayed with kids","What a great experience, the house was perfect. There were 6 of us and we were quite comfortable. I love that people leave what they don't use, there were a couple of sodas in the fridge along with some snacks left out so we returned the kindness and left some donuts, frozen pizza, soda. Will definitely use again when available."

Stayed with kids",The perk of extended visiting hours at the Cat Sanctuary enticed us to stay at the airbnb. We thoroughly enjoyed the interaction and volunteering at the sanctuary. The home was conveniently located right next door. It is. Spacious house with all the accommodations a family needs. We made our own meals in the kitchen. My kids had good Internet connection so they were able to use their electronic devices when we were not at the sanctuary. All in all it was a fantastic experience.

Stayed one night",I had the pleasure of staying at Furball Farm Inn recently. It was a dream come true. I got to spend the day at the furball farm sanctuary next door then got to walk across the driveway to the Airbnb for the evening. I relaxed in the recliner and watched some TV. The bedroom was very comfortable. I paid a visit to the outdoor cats in the evening while they were all out and about. Location was good- only about 10-15 minute drive to food and coffee. The entire experience was an A Plus and I can’t wait to come back (hopefully for longer next time). This should be on ever cat lovers bucket list!!!

Stayed with kids","This says say a few words, hmm. This is a cat lovers dream. You are greeted by cats. Can sit outside at night with the peace and quite of the country, and of course more cats. You wake up in the morning and are greeted by cats. Most of all a kind compassionate owner. They should be proud. This beautiful remodeled house is perfect in every way. Huge open concept, large bathrooms. We did not stay long enough to use the great laundry room. Loved the outside seating!!! A place that will not disappoint. The cat sanctuary is the biggest bonus and my personal favorite. Put this on your bucket list!!🐈🐈‍⬛"

Stayed a few nights","I don't normally write reviews. However Lisa stood out amongst a sea of mediocrity. The effort they put in as hosts is evident in every aspect of the home and they take pride in what they do.
We had issues (our own) at the beginning and they helped us remediate the problem IMMEDIATELY. Even when we lacked the collective brain cells to unlock the door.
I would visit Lisa's (and Kevin's) place again in a heartbeat. I hope to when we visit family next year.
Thank you for the wonderful memories during a friend's Wedding weekend."

Stayed a few nights","This is a home on a lake with great views and a great place to relax, take in the quiet life and enjoy fishing from the dock or from a boat if you have one. The one drawback is the 57 steps down to the lake or should I say the 57 steps back up the hill. But every step is worth the view."

As an add on…I accidentally left a bag of stuff to return to Walmart…and Lisa returned for me without even being asked! Hero status! A great host!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was super cute, clean and very comfortable. The front porch deck was nice to hang outside and just chill. Actually we did lots of that after a long walk and or bike rides. Best place to bike is the Sakatah Singing Trails bike path. We parked at the Dairy Queen and went from there.
Can walk across street and down 59 steps to access a deck to sit or a few more steps to the dock. We often took our chairs down to be closer to water and watch any lake activity. Saw Eagle one evening. Pretty quiet town with most places not open til Wednesday. Enjoyed food trucks at 10,000 drops with cocktails or beer. Both excellent. Great place to relax."
