Stayed a few nights","Kimberly was an absolute breeze to book with. Communication was prompt and she was very accommodating. The home was exactly as described. It was clean, cozy, and had all the amenities to make it feel like an extension of our home. The location was also secluded yet easily accessible and the view was unbeatable. We will be booking here next year for sure, can't wait!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a special place. Beautifully maintained bright and airy with wonderful seaway river views and access. We dropped our kayaks in from the small dock, a little tricky with low water levels but totally doable as the dock is new and very sturdy. We also explored nearby trails as recommended in the guest book. Very comfortable and clean accommodation."

Stayed with a pet","We had such a wonderful time during our stay! We enjoyed the firepit, the neighbors, the wildlife was quite plentiful. We got to see at least 3 ships per day going through of various sizes and so many beautiful sailboats on the water. We snorkeled, swam, fished; saw minks, a fox, deer, a wood chuck, loons, cormorants, red squirrels, chipmunks, crayfish a plenty and so much more. We enjoyed the ease of the kitchen space that we chose to eat in most of the time. We got great firewood from the amish saw mill up where the guest book told us to go with the cheapest price in town of $3 per bundle; they even had maple syrup there too for sale. We werent far from alex bay, or black river. It was a great trip and we really loved how cute and clean Kimberly's place is. We prepared ourselves for needing everything, but she truly already had everything there that we would need in the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom."

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful cottage, very clean and well-appointed. We brought our own sheets and towels because that’s what we’re used to, but if we hadn’t they would have been provided for us. Lots of windows and beautiful views of the river.. I looked forward to the sailboats launching from Brockville Ontario on the far side of the St Laurence every day at 6pm. We found it to be a great base for exploring Sacketts Harbor historical sites, and Wellesley Island. Kitchen had everything you need in terms of appliances, utensils, and pots and pans. Kimberly responded immediately to any questions we had - Fire TV was new to us and we needed a bit of help. We highly recommend this charming property and our host."

The view of the sunset and river are beautiful and sitting on the porch having coffee each morning was the tranquility that keeps you sane. We mixed in some day trips to local places with the kids, it was a good mix to keep them happy and busy. This is a very good value for the space and the amenities and if you stay you will have no regrets."

The open living/kitchen layout really worked for us for the kids. We loved the grounds and of course the incredible views of the river. Wonderful vistas from every window. We were in town to visit family vacationing in the area and enjoyed a large family meal grilling steaks and sitting on the porch while the sun set. Loved the close proximity to the park for the girls. Can’t say enough good things. Cottage impeccably kept. Thank you!"

The views of the river, watching the weather, the occasional barge, and night skies are worth the visit alone; We spent a good deal of time exploring the trails at the state park nearby and visiting the new Blue Heron Trail at the Red Barn. Both spots are close to the cottage. This is a great space!"

Stayed a few nights","This house on the beautiful Saint Lawrence River is so lovely I almost hate to tell people about it because I don’t want it to become so popular a destination that I am not able to get to spend time there when I want to! It is a gorgeous home with all the amenities ,spectacular view, privacy without isolation, quality, comfort, tranquility, Proximity to local attractions... it is a home away from home . It is cozy in the fall and comfortable in the summer ;it is pet friendly and people friendly . It is spacious without being too much to handle. So much nicer than any hotel room ,Nestled in nature with wildlife abounding.It is full of light and From any given window you might see oceangoing vessels, or sailboats or fisherman, or deer or black squirrels or chipmunks or many different species of birds or waterfowl . It’s simply paradise!"

Well stocked kitchen was a joy to be in. It was very quiet during our stay, something we really enjoyed. The owner's sister and father were friendly and helpful with any questions we had. We enjoyed visits from their dogs Bear and Lu. I don't know if we have ever been this relaxed on a vacation! We will be looking forward to spending more time here in the future. Thank you so much for opening your wonderful home to us!"

Felt very secluded but was pretty close to stores and other things. My suggestion: if you're planning on coming in the summer and you want to rent a boat, make sure you call ahead. We didn't, and there were none available. All in all, everything we were looking for and more."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect getaway if you want a private hideaway , or if you need a place close to all the North country attractions. So much nicer than all the hotels and less expensive too. The home itself is lovely and comfortable with a gorgeous view of the river and Brockville on the Canadian side. You’ll need nothing but your clothes—and food. Sit on the porch and watch the big ships or the small boats go by while you drink your coffee or sip your wine . You have your own dock with private access to the river for swimming or kayaking . From the moment I arrived I felt at home and I so hated to leave; in fact, before we left, we booked another long weekend there. It was the most peaceful, refreshing vacation I have ever had, and I have done a lot of traveling all over the world; however this stress-free, low-key five days on the St. Lawrence River left me with a feeling of serenity like no other."

All of the windows provided a beautiful view and made the rooms so cheery! One down side although was the fact that there were no curtains in the upstairs bathroom and three of the bedroom windows. We never did find anymore than one wash cloth and ended up buying some. All in all we had a great time, just a bit disappointing."

All you have to do is pack up your clothes. Nothing else is needed. Enjoy the local farms and the farm stands for your vegetables!!! We picked up some asparagus just before we left!!!

Stayed a few nights",Kimberly is a very responsive host. She responded to emails very quickly and was more than accommodating. The house was wonderful. I'm a cooker and found the kitchen to be fully equipped; right down to a double boiler and crock pot. We were up for Family Weekend at St. Lawrence Univ. and loved our stay. We were able to sit down to a home cooked meal instead of going through the hassle of restaurant reservations. The house has wonderful space and a lot of light coming in through the windows. Sipping morning coffee and gazing out at the St. Lawrence River (which really is right there!) was such a treat. We're thinking about coming back in the summer to tour Ottawa and the Thousand Islands. There's even a vineyard about 20 minutes up the road in Ogdensburg that does wine tasting and has wonderful wines. We highly recommend this homey cottage. It certainly is more than a place to hang your head. It's a home away from home.

Stayed about a week","We had a lovely stay at the cottage. The space is much nicer than the pictures can show. It was airy and comfortable. The master suite upstairs has a wonderful balcony, which was perfect for watching the stunning sunsets and viewing the Milky Way overhead on a clear night. Kimberly was wonderful, and her relatives are nearby (with their adorable dogs) if you need anything. The house had everything we needed.
It is a great, private spot to relax by the water, but it's also in a great location for seeing the North Country. We went as far as Alexandria Bay in one direction and the Eisenhower Dam in Massena in the other. A few notes about touring: there are several Amish communities nearby, so you will see buggies on the roads and in parking lots. There is a nice general store in Heuvelton that sells a lot of Amish crafts. Also, check out Mares Wares on Route 37. Marianne sells locals artists' work, as well as her own pottery. If you are lucky, you can sign up for a lesson! Of course, the Remington Museum in Ogdensburg is remarkable. The whole area is quite rural, so be prepared for long stretches of farmland and tiny little towns.
All in all, we had a wonderful time. Thank you!"

We roasted s'mores and watched the gorgeous sunsets over the river for several nights during our stay. There was a master suite upstairs with a full bath and a bedroom with bunk beds downstairs with a half bath. We enjoyed the kitchen with a gas stove, dishwasher, large refrigerator and microwave. Beautiful hard wood floors throughout and a fireplace too, which we did not use as it never was cold enough to warrant this. One tip: the water has a mineral taste so we purchased bottled water to drink during our stay. I would definitely stay here again!"

We set up games on the lawn, had a BBQ, sat by the fire pit and watch an amazing sunset over the St. Lawrence. Next time we will stay longer and bring the dog!"

We enjoyed watching the ship activity especially while having breakfast in the great little breakfast nook. We didn't end up doing any real cooking there, but there is a full kitchen. When we arrived late afternoon, at dusk, there were a couple of lights on and the heat was going which was very welcoming. Kimberly was very easy to reach by e-mail/text when I had questions. I would stay here again if I am back in the area visiting my niece at St Lawrence University. The beds were very comfortable and the cottage was very quiet."

it is on the river, has a great lawn and you can see the river from every room.
the place is very welcoming, we stayed a family of 4 (kids are 4yr, 1yr) and had plenty of space. the internal design is so very smart, you can see the river from everywhere.
thousand islands area is a quick 25 minutes drive where one can take a tour of the islands.
note that there is no way to the river from the yard to actually swim in it , but it's a great place to sit back and watch the ships go by..."

It rained the second night but we didn't mind as the living space is very cosy. I think my only regret was not having blinds or drapes in the bedrooms but that is it - am already looking forward to our next trip.

Also, when doing groceries - best place we found is in Ogdensburg at Price Choppers."

Stayed one night","LOVED this place. Zen Inn is so unique. It felt like a boutique hotel combined with a Japanese guesthouse. Everything was spotless and being able to have your private space plus space where you might chat with other guests is wonderful. Josee has thought of every detail to cater to your comfort from a handful of amenities in your room, in case you forgot something, to an array of breakfast items to have and a plethora of other thoughtful touches that make your stay extremely easy and comfortable. Keycode entry is fantastic! I loved the exposed brick and high ceilings of the common area and the overhead shower is very cool. I can't say enough positive things about this one of a kind place to stay that was perfect for this single traveler."

Stayed one night","Josee's place is brand new. It is sparkling
clean. The linens are a brilliant white. The furniture in the common room that is blue very clean no stains. The rooms are abit compact basically for sleeping. When I was staying there there was me and one other guy so in the evening the whole place was to myself. In the morning he was not friendly but that was OK. The washrooms are in the food area. The bathing rooms are off the dorm rooms in the sleeping area. Joee's place is great if you need a clean place to stay for a night or a couple of nights. If you come in a group it works better for company in the common area. Everything is as advertised there is a good variety of breads, muffins, and bagels with a variety of spreads jams, Nutella and butter. Josee is very friendly she will explain anything about the town you want to know. And she is available by cell phone 24/7 if you have an issue."

Stayed one night","Despite nice common spaces and easy self check-in, we were very disappointed by our experience here. We booked the place as a rest stop, to get a good night’s sleep in the middle of a long journey. The bed was tiny (small single), the small room (a plywood box) had no ventilation or air flow, and we were awoken at 8 am by banging and a power drill in the plywood wall next to our heads.
It would be feasible for one guest if you just need a place to sleep, but not at these rates."

The rooms are small, but well arranged, so unless you're traveling with a lot of luggage, you'll be good. The bed is a single, but very comfortable. Everything is very clean.

The decor was really neat. Excellent location close to the waterfront, free overnight street parking. The host is not on-site, and so following the rules is up to each guest, but Josee is very each to reach and quick to communicate with if information is needed. I would stay again. Thank you."

The kitchen had everything we needed to cook Christmas meals to share with local family. The house was private and quiet but close to everything we needed. The thing we had an ""issue"" with was the heat in two of the bedrooms. Megan did offer suggestions to help but the regulation of the heat was difficult. Access to the bathroom for one of the guests was difficult at night. Megan made sure everything was clean and we had more than enough linens and blankets. We arrived just after a bad winter storm - everything was plowed and shoveled. I would not hesitate to recommend Megan's place."

Third, there was coffee for first thing in the morning after our long trip! Last, my communications with Marci prior to and during our stay were excellent. I felt a strong sense of obligation to leave the place in tip-top shape. The sunsets were magical, the weather was perfect, the ease of being away from the hustle and bustle but also being close enough to fulfill our needs was the perfect combination. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone who wants to be enveloped in god's greatest beauty. Those northern lights at night cannot be matched! And falling asleep to the rhythm of the water washing up on shore is so soothing. We intend to visit this place many more times. -Jill (9/11/21)"

The hosts thought of anything and everything you could need. It had a fully equipped kitchen with a dining table with a beautiful view. There was a fully stocked coffee bar with a drip coffee maker and a Keurig. All necessary linens were provided, sheets, towels, tea towels, etc. They even provided a little basket of toiletries which we were thankful for having forgot a few things!
There is a nice deck that overlooks the river. Perfect for reading or sipping drinking coffee. The dock was nice to sit on and watch the beautiful sunsets.
We loved our stay and hope to come back again soon!"

There was adequate parking for our truck and boat which she made accommodations for! The pictures were precise and the cottage was very clean. Looking forward to staying again in the future. Hands down would recommend!! Cassie and her husband did all the work fixing up the cottage bringing it back to life to be the cutest most relaxing vacation spot on the river. My only regret was having to leave.

Prescott is a lovely small town. The river walk is beautiful!
This is a very interesting apartment. There is a lot of fun memorabilia, mostly from the 40s, 50s and 60s. The interior walls are only 8 feet or so and the ceiling is at least 10 feet, so there is no sound or light separation from one room to another. This is not a complaint, as such, just a warning so others will not be caught unawares.
We enjoyed the location overlooking the main drag. We found it very quiet."

Safe and reliable host -- very responsive, friendly, helpful, flexible, always available but non-intrusive
Place -- safe and secure location and building, conditioner as well as shampoo, more than one towel per person, clean throughout, thoughtful and generous touches and gifts, decor that is (very) pleasing to the eye, physically comfortable (e.g., beds, sofas, lighting), light and airy
Would stay again in a blink of an eye. Thank you, Ben"

Ben & Jessica went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We had a delicious fish dinner across the street at Bobby's Restaurant and finished our evening with a short walk along the Sandra S. Lawn Harbour/Marina. I would highly recommend this lodging to everyone and will definitely book a stay there again if ever in the Prescott area."

Stayed one night","Our first time being to Prescott (visiting friends in Cornwall) and we were not disappointed with this carefully curated, meticulously thoughtful guest touches to make our stay so enjoyable!
If you love one-of-a-kind properties and want to be transported back in time - book with Ben & Jessica!!
The retro welcome package, frosted mugs and ice ready to go for us. Coffee all set up for the morning, just needed to press a button and we had our caffeine! The radio was softly playing retro music when we arrived and the 8-track player in the headboard of one of our beds was AMAZING!!! What’s trip down memory lane😉
This is the best location to tour downtown and admire all the local entrepreneurs, history and architecture. We grabbed breakfast at Bobby’s and it was perfect!
We can’t wait to visit again - my heart is definitely attached to this space. Beds and pillows were so comfortable and we all know how rare that is - well done guys!
Thanks again for your wonderful hospitality!"

A great town to spend a few days in, and Ben has spared no expense on his wonderful spaces. We were lucky enough to see another unit upstairs and it was amazing as well. Everyone in town was extremely freindly and my overseas guests and myself and husband had a really, really enjoyable stay here. OUr only regret was we didn't have time to do a polaroid for the wall!!"

The theme is the 1950’s we had A & W Root Beer & candy Popcorn waiting for us along with a personalized welcome on a Betty Boop sign🤩 The apartment was squeaky clean and had lots of nice extras in the kitchen! We had such a wonderful time, just a short walk to the river and you can walk for miles so pretty. We had a great brunch and also a dinner at local restaurants near by, both within walking distance! Prescott was our choice because it was in the middle of the areas we wanted to explore, and it worked out perfectly. All three of us felt this was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at 💖. Thank you to our hosts😍"

Stayed a few nights","This is a unique place where the hosts have gone to a lot of trouble to decorate in a unique and quirky way. We loved the retro vibe. Kitchen stocked with coffee and tea and helpful cooking condiments. Beds looked new and were very comfortable. Nice linens and towels. Host were very communicative and super flexible with us - including allowing us to stay longer when a last minute work meeting prevented on-time check out.
The only thing to be aware of (as one other reviewer mentioned) is that walls don’t go to the ceiling, so sound travels in between the rooms of the apartment. This was OK for the two of us but may not suit everyone.
Prescott is a lovely place to visit and I would definitely stay here again."

Ben has thought of everything and makes you feel at home with a welcome pack, and kind gestures like leaving on the bedside lights. Follow Ben's instructions to the parking and it's a great location for the town. Note: may not be for snorers. As it's an old building, the walls are visual dividers only as they don't go to the ceiling. Will stay again."

The place in general is amazing - thoughtfully decorated, great amenities, cozy and cute touches, generally clean etc. Ben and Jessica were so great with prompt responses and helpful answers. Our only two complaints were that one, we could not find face/shower cloths to use for our showers, or a dish scrubber to use in order to put our dishes away for them! And two, some things (more lighting working, fan and bedframe mirror cleaner, more TV channels etc) could have been more convenient and/or comfortable for us. However, nothing enough to remove a star. The stay was definitely 5 ☆ and we appreciate it very much. We would definitely return. Thank you again, Ben and Jessica!"

Ben and Jessica are amazing hosts and always available. Had an issue with the lock on the first night and they came right over at 10pm. Outstanding communication and very open about everything.
The apartment is much bigger than I expected and anything needed is available like coffee, tea, lots of pots and pan and even a bbq. Ohhhh and lets not forget the bathroom with a huge claw foot tub....to die for.
Only 2 very small thing but it didn’t really make my experience bad would be just to have curtains in the back so it is darker in the early morning, maybe an extra TV in the smaller bedroom because if you bave kids only one TV is available now and maybe a fan in the master bedroom. But like I said it didn’t affect me but it would be a welcome addition.
Will be booking this place again for sure."

We were really impressed by all the recommendations from Ben, and appreciated all the clear communications. The home was set-up prepared for guests to be comfortable. The decor is so fantastic and fun! Each room has items to take a peek at! Beds were extremely comfortable, place was very clear and cared for. If I had to make any suggestions, it would be possible a fan for each bedroom as the AC unit was felt most in the living room, a bit more tv options, and maybe some curtains at the back for a bit of privacy (but none a deal breaker by any means). Would gladly stay here again and take in even more that Prescott has to offer!"

Stayed with kids","Just had a 3 night stay with our family and it was absolutely stellar!
The cottage itself is cute and was perfect for our 11 month old daughter (since she’s super fascinated with stairs these days) and was a quick walk out to a beautiful morning sunrise and sunset view! Made it feel extra relaxing!!
The fire pit is just across the bridge and we sat around there mostly during the cold fall nights! We brought our own firewood and kindle as well which we just had enough for 3 nights!!!
Propane was left from the previous guest so we didn’t have to use the one we brought which was super nice!! :)
We mostly spent our days outdoors didn’t leave the cottage only for a couple things the one day but the town and stores are super easy to get to and find!
And the entire community along the peninsula were all super nice and everyone would wave when you drove by! Felt like being back at home !!
It was an overall over the top experience for our family and our first AirBnb stay together so it was really nice and to get away just before I have to return to work next month, the perfect way to end my maternity leave ! :) Our home away from home and did not want it to end! :)
Thank you once again to the byrds! For the complimentary bottle of wine and the craft beer tall can which I used to cook our beer can chicken!!! It was absolutely amazing! We will for sure be back! ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Lost my first day to having to clean the cottage when I got there, others food and garbage left for me in the freezer, food cooked on the BBQ left from others before us, making it not usable and was told I was to burn it off to use it, I am not responsible for cleaning up after the previous renters cooked on food. Others greasy prints left on stuff, food crumbs in the cabinets, towels smell moldy, dust on stuff and dried food left on the placemats, windows smudged and dirty, stains all over the couch and had to put a sheet on the couch so I could sit on it without feeling grossed out. Shower sprays water out of the shower before you can get in, the sink is a smurf sink which makes you make a mess with water everywhere. Was not happy how this was handled either. Guess I was just the lucky one."

Stayed a few nights","Just an amazing stay. You’re living right on the St Lawrence, and just steps away from the river is the Byrds’ wonderful family compound, which features a magical and treed private sandy beach that opens up to a quiet and shallow inlet off the river, perfect for kayaking and SUPing as well as reading and napping. (We were there a lot.) And the place itself was so modern, well-attired and clean, with so many thoughtful touches that really made the most of that unique space. A comfortable bed with excellent sheets in an air-conditioned room, plus a full kitchen with outdoor grill, was amazing. No WIFI was a plus, frankly; in the rare moments we did need the internet—say, to get in touch with the Byrds, who responded very quickly and kindly—our data worked great. A fantastic getaway for a family or a couple looking for post-pandemic peace."

Stayed a few nights","Wow - what a gem this place is! it is literally right on the water of the North Channel of the St. Lawrence River. We experienced beautiful sunsets on one side and brilliant sunrises on the other. We were entertained by all the activity on the channel - birds, geese, a Great Blue Heron, and brief nightly visits from a mink! This former tugboat office is now a lovely little cottage right beside OPG's tug boat yard and it was fascinating to watch little Oliver the tugboat and Halton the barge go off to work in the morning. Even with all this activity, the property is very private and quiet. We walked the length of the private road to the tip of the isthmus and met some really nice neighbours and their intersting homes. Met their dogs and chickens, too. Inside the cottage, it's all white and blue and nautical, of course. Every amenity is provided - even a bottle of wine! Comfortable bed and amazing shower. Check in is a breeze and Derek was quick to communicate if needed.
All in all, a great spot for a peaceful break. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","Alexander's Place is beautifully decorated and as pictured. I had asked prior to booking if it was suitable for 4 yr old twins, and told yes. I would not recommend staying here if you have rambunctious young children. As described in the listing you are sharing their home, but there is no door to separate you from the upstairs which posed a real problem with wild kids. I spent most of my time yelling at my kids to stay downstairs and then feeling embarrassed that someone could hear me yelling at my kids. The other notes to not stay with young kids, There is no area to sit and eat. There is an outside table but it was raining. If you are not staying with young kids you will find this to be a great place to stay. Everything is provided for you and very clean. We did get a chance to go swimming and kayak which was amazing. We know the area very well and would recommend Alexander's place to others staying in the area with out kids."

Stayed with kids","For us (a family of 3 with a 7 year old, a 26' boat, and orginally from a nearby town), it was a great fit! If you know much about this part of the St. Lawrence, you dock overnight at your own risk (waves, wind, etc.). So having the new Morristown launch so close plus use of their dock during the day/calm water was an excellent setup for us. Plenty of water to dock up to a 30 footer on the the southwest side, & plenty of room to drive in & park both truck & trailer.
My wife & I were also pleased with the interior setup. While it is an (open) split entry with the upper level private, the lower level also ""feels"" very private & cozy. Essentially 2 bed rooms, a full bath, & a full living room. No kitchen per se, but a microwave & coffee maker, plus access to a refrig, freezer, & laundry in the adjoining shop/mechanicals room. Once you use the lock box to enter through the common split entry, thereafter you have a private entrance via the rear glass sliding door to the living area."

Cabin was clean and cute and the lake view was great. We had hoped to take advantage of the fire-pit with lake views but were very busy visiting family in Canton. I would stay again.

Stayed a few nights","The place was absolutely wonderful. Jenny provided excellent instructions and photos, which first getting there could have been a little tricky without. Getting in was a breeze. The place was spotless and smelled clean. There were plenty of extra towels and linens, along with just about anything extra we could possibly need. The mosquitos were rough (nature of the location) and we came prepared but there were citronella candles and bug spray available. The couch was comfortable and the smart tv was great to watch when it got rainy out.
The porch was perfect to sit and listen to the birds, and watch the deer, squirrels and chipmunks. The only thing I could say is it maybe wasn’t quite as private as I thought but all we had to do was sit in the side yard or point our chairs a different direction to not see the neighbors as much. Even with the neighbors close proximity it was still very quiet and peaceful. We hope to be back in the area again soon & would 100% chose to stay here again!"

You can see the river through the trees, but I'm not sure if there is access. Jenny was very responsive and addressed any issues, however minor, by the next day. Big Lots is up the street and they only thing that stays open late. There's a huge grocery section inside if you need anything. I'm up this way for work so I don't get out and do much and can't recommend any activities, but if you need to work while traveling, the wifi is great. I would definitely stay again.

Being in a downtown area, surrounded by older buildings then to open the door to this gorgeous space. There was nothing he would change, we loved everything about the space.

Stayed a few nights","Perfect. The space is very large and is decorated to give it a real sense of place, relating beautifully to the historic St Lawrence River. Bathroom has a spa feeling. Kitchen is open to the large space and is well equipped. Location is excellent, just across the street from a comfortable Irish Pub and the riverfront walk. The light in the morning is beautiful, streaming into the bedroom (equipped with black out shades but I chose to let the morning light in).
Ben was responsive, friendly and easy to work with."

Stayed a few nights","Beautifully designed place, right on the main street of a small quiet harbor town. Still plenty to do: Farmer's Market, several resaturants, town beach, walkway on the harbor, all in easy walking distance. A visiting theater group did an amazing, clever rendition of Alice in Wonderland at the waterside ampitheater one block away. A short drive gets you to bigger cities with more to do, but then you can come back to this quiet town and avoid the crowds, noise and hassle. Courteous touches like good coffee, creamer and some sparkling water provided. Little table and chairs on the back landing. Shower is spacious and beautiful, feels like a spa. Would definately stay here or at another of their rentals again!"

Regarding the location, it is truly unbeatable! Being right across the street from the waterfront, the beautiful riverside walkway provides perfect opportunities for leisurely strolls. There's plenty to do in the area!
I highly recommend this Airbnb apartment! Whether you seek a peaceful escape or a convenient base to explore the surrounding area, this place has everything you need for a wonderful stay."

Lovely welcoming touches including the chocolates, chalkboard greeting, the coffee cream (VERY much appreciated) and bottle water. The poer roller shades were a comvenient feature too. Be prepared to climb the stairs to get to the suite boy or was worth it! I would definitely stay there again if traveling to Prescott."

So much attention to detail it's truly impressive! This place is for 2 but it is HUGE!
Everything is clean, modern, thought out for an easy stay. Very well equipped and superbly decorated apartment, kitchen and bathroom, it's much better than described!
Finally, we met Ben upon checking out, and we understand where the passion and genuine interest to host comes from! Very friendly and dedicated host, we will surely plan to stay here again when the occasion presents itself.
For any couple or solo traveller looking for a excellent place, super centrally located in a small town, next to the waterfront, 1 hour from Ottawa or 2 hours from Montréal we would recommend staying here without any hesitation!
Merci Ben & Jess!

Stayed a few nights","Ben and Jessica were fantastic and their place even better. We booked the 3rd floor unit and it was beautiful. So clean, tidy and more items there than I’ve ever seen in and air b&b. Shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, iron board, even a portable fan for the bedroom. The kitchen was well stocked with ice maker fridge, coffee, chocolate, water waiting for you. I love to cook and the kitchen had EVERYTHING you would need, right down to cook oil (which I forgot). The location was near a pub, bank, corner store, trails along the water front and walk the other direction to enjoy the neighbourhood. We even took a drive down hwy 2 and found this cute little restaurant/marina where we had lunch on the waterfront patio and enjoyed local
brewery drinks. I want to keep this gem to myself but there has been so much care put into this place that people need to know. Looking for a little staycation/escape book this place! Couple days or a week it will not disappoint."

The kitchen was fully stocked and allowed for meal prepping and full meals… Ben and Jessica were also kind enough to incorporate a desk into the space during my stay, or made for a perfect work from home space and I was happy to join meetings with the impressive surroundings in my background. The space is conveniently located very close to a local pub, great for getting together with friends, as well as the local walking trail which makes for a great lunch break stroll. Overall, a great space with wonderful hosts who are very responsive. I look forward to booking another stay in this great bnb in future!"

We did not use the kitchen because we spent our time with family - we were there for a grandson’s graduation. So can’t comment on if appliances worked etc but the coffee pot did work which was good. We did have to borrow a toaster from our family but know Cyndi said she would purchase one. There are not many outside places to have breakfast so a toaster would be a good addition. Bathroom was clean and she provided towels and wash cloths, a bathmat. All we needed. The stairs into the apt was the only negative and Cyndi did say they are working on them. So all in all a very good stay. Thank you."

Ben's property is quiet, serene and easy to find. He is such a responsive host, clearly communicating from check-in to check-out while giving guests privacy during their stay. This great studio style unit has everything you could need for your stay from all kitchen esentials to desks, table and couch space all in a roomy clean space. The internet was a bit spotty my past stay, yet this is the north country and I do not feel this is a reflection of the host just a fact of life in the area. highly suggest this rental when you find yourself traveling along New York's Northern border."

Stayed one night","Place was in a great location, check-in was very convenient, and included a parking spot.
The bad would include how the door to enter had two locks on it, however the top lock did not function due to it being uneven relative to the hole it was supposed to fit in. It would hit the wall instead.
Furthermore, the other unit(s) that are attached to the one my girlfriend and I stayed in have doors that lock/unlock on their side, not the one of this airbnb. Meaning that the people in there could unlock the doors and enter if they wanted to.
These two things are security risks, other than that the place was decent. I also don’t understand why the host charges a cleaning fee when they mention in the instructions that they expect us to take out the trash and ensure all dishes are clean."

Stayed a few nights","PROS:
I had a wonderful 2-night stay over the weekend! The suite was much nicer than I had anticipated. I saw from the pictures that there was a Keurig, but hadn’t realized there were already coffee pods available and stopped at a grocery store on my way to the rental to buy some. I really appreciate little conveniences like that. I also hadn’t even realized until I first arrived that there was an oven, but be careful if you decide to cook anything in it, because the smoke detector is right by it and is very sensitive. I set the alarm off twice…the first time the oven was completely empty (and looked like it’s never been used) and I was just opening the oven to put something in and it went off immediately and scared the crap out of me lol, but I assume they are able to control the alarm remotely, because both times it went off, it only rang twice and then the noise stopped. Definitely got my heart racing for a few seconds 😂. Also, the fridge was perfect, but the freezer space/portion is very tiny, so don’t plan on bringing more than maybe 1-2 items that need to be frozen (depending on their size).
From the pictures, I wasn’t expecting too much from the bed, but was so pleasantly surprised when I laid down on it for the first time to test it out and then later slept like a baby each night! It feels like it’s one of those boxed memory foam mattresses.
TV and Wi-Fi worked great! Some other Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at have Netflix and other streaming apps, but make you log into your own account (which I guess I can understand), but no need to worry about that in this rental, Netflix was readily available!
CONS:
I don’t think “cons” is really an appropriate title for this section of the review, because I don’t really have anything negative to say. However, I felt I should make note of some things that weren’t an issue for me, but may be important to other potential renters…
There is an adjacent rental and the two rentals can be accessed by an adjoining door. This would be great for a family or group that wants to rent out both sides and want or need easy access into the other rental. However, because of this door (I’m assuming it’s the door 🤷🏻‍♀️), I could hear adults and children speaking in normal tones on the other side, so if you’re someone that would be irritated by that or are a light sleeper, this rental might not be your best option unless no one’s renting the other side. BUT, the amount of times I heard noises or speaking were minimal and I’m not a light sleeper, so it didn’t bother me at all. But, it did make me conscious of “the other side” hearing MY conversations, though lol.
Another “con, but not con” 😄 is the location of the rental. If you’re planning on spending most of your time in any of the towns that are 20+ mins away and do not have your own transportation, this location may not be the best option for you…just depends on what you’re willing to spend.
I flew into Ogdensburg airport and planned on spending the majority of my time in Ogdensburg, so I ended up spending a good amount on George….aka the ONLY Uber driver in the area 😂. (BTW, George’s phone number is (315) 323-1877, if you need or prefer Uber). I called a cab company just to see how much the same trip would cost and they said $83, which was a significant difference compared to the $27-33 I was paying Uber. With all my trips, I ended up spending almost $150...I probably should’ve looked into renting a car. However, I had previously looked at the price per night for this rental and added it with how much I would spend on Uber a day and, for me, it still made more sense to stay at Ben’s and pay the cost for an Uber, because you are essentially getting your own studio apartment vs. the in-town Airbnb options (in Ogdensburg), which only offer you a private room and cost more than double the price per night.
Paying $115/night to stay in town and only getting a private room, in addition to, having to share the common areas with strangers (especially with Covid still going around) and then still having to pay someone for transportation, didn’t make sense to me.
All-in-all, I would 100% recommend renting this suite. I had a very nice, relaxing stay and definitely plan on renting with them again for any future trips, as well as, suggesting this rental to other friends who may be going to visit the area!"

I tried to write a review last time we stayed here but I got busy and I must have waited too long since I was no longer able to post a review. Anyhow, I will write one this time. The studio we stayed at is the newer studio. It has some really nice amenities such as an induction cooktop, nice oven, Keurig coffee machine (coffee, non-dairy creamer and sugar is supplied), and I especially like the bathroom barn door at the back of the studio and the large TV. Everything that we needed was supplied. The hosts even gave us fresh eggs from their hens for breakfast. Communication was great, nice quiet place close to Canton. Will definitely stay here again if needed."

Stayed a few nights","Firstly, this is probably one of the best stays I’ve booked in the area and I have book many AirBnBs in the Canton-Potsdam area for work. That being said my review is based off being a traveling health-care professional who works night shift. The space is quiet. Well heated because it is winter time, the kitchen has everything I need to cook my own meals, the bathroom was exceptionally clean and well maintained, and finally the bed was very comfortable. The only negative I can think of was that the drive to work from the AirBnB was further than previous places I’ve book. That is no fault to the owners. But I have to say that the quality of this listing totally makes up for it. It’s something to consider for other healthcare travelers. But definitely not a deal breaker! Thanks Ben for a wonderful stay! I will definitely book once again!"

Melanie was kind and gracious and came and met us as the tiniest bit of a sunset greeted us after a light rain. We shopped at the local grocery and made a meal at the cottage. Reading on the front porch was so relaxing! The St Lawrence River is remarkably clear & clean! For the money, this was an amazing value!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a hidden gem on the St. Lawrence!
Ali is a great host!
Kudos to whomever is keeping the place clean because they do an EXCELLENT job!

The guidebook was excellent and very well detailed.
We actually wish we would’ve had more time to stay in the space. It is very tranquil and relaxing. We could not hear the traffic at all.
The kitchen is very well stocked for someone that wants to make a lite dinner or lunch.
The decor was very relaxing and just right, with things like extra pillows and cuddly blankets in the chairs and throw pillows on the couch.
Although we were there in the dead of winter, the view of the St. Lawrence was great. I’m sure it’s beautiful in the Summer.
We have already recommended it to friends who have a wedding coming up this summer!"

Stayed a few nights","My recent stay at Ali's riverside property in Ogdensburg, NY, was an extraordinary experience. This unique accommodation, a beautifully transformed basement, has been skillfully converted into a spacious and aesthetically pleasing open-plan living space. The design cleverly maximizes both comfort and style, making it a standout choice for any traveler.
The cleanliness of the property deserves a special mention. Every area of the space was impeccably maintained, ensuring a comfortable and welcoming environment. It's evident that great care is taken to keep the place in top condition.
While the owner resides upstairs, their presence was unobtrusive. There were occasional, faint sounds from above, which is quite understandable in a shared property setting. This in no way detracted from the overall peacefulness and privacy of my stay."

Stayed a few nights","Ali was very responsive via email and access into the rental easy. We were surprised by Ali’s thoughtfulness in gifting a “Happy Birthday” balloon and card, and providing decaf coffee for us. There was coffee, creamer and sugar but no salt and pepper.
Ali’s place is one large spacious room with a small kitchen alcove that has all utensils needed to cook. The bathroom is beautiful but do note, the access to the bathroom is through another room a short distance away. There are three separate steps between the main room and the bathroom, one down and two up which was a surprise to us.
The central air has no control in the rental space and it was colder than we were comfortable with. We didn’t bring sweaters but there were cozy lap blankets to cuddle up in. Sheets and linens are high quality and were amazingly comfortable. We were content sitting by the river watching the large ships go by and reading. Very relaxing stay in a beautiful location."

Was a little hard to find at first since I arrived at night but after getting it down it was perfect. Check in/parking was easy. The view the next morning was peaceful and very beautiful on the river. The cottage itself was very clean, thoughtful amenities and was supplied in the bathroom. The bedrooms were very comfy and we slept well both nights. And foremost the food up in this area was AMAZING I was actually shocked. We tried “The place” first which had good food, Bayside Grill also a very good spot and in the mornings we ate at Philips diner (these 3 spots were a 10 min drive from the cottage). I recommend these for visitors. Melanie was an awesome host and her cottage home was amazing - would not hesitate to stay again."

The enclosed glass front porch is perfect for a afternoon nap, or just to chill. Plenty of space outdoors to sit and watch the river and the boats go by. You have your own sturdy dock I could go on and on. I thank you Melanie for sharing your piece of paradise with us, you are a wonderful host and god willing we cross paths again. Dale and Lisa Smith"
