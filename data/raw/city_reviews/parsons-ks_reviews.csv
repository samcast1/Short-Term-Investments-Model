Group trip","The place is very cute and has lots of outside lights and a nice large yard. A cool fire ring in the front area and lots of parking. The inside is cute and has all update amenities.
The yard had trash scattered everywhere and the trashcan in the back looked like critters had gotten in it. The place had everything you could need and extra shampoo and such in the bathroom if you forgot something. Unfortunately there were dirty utensils that were with the clean dishes that we washed. Couldn’t empty the garbage because outside can was full."

Stayed one night","We went for a little romantic getaway and used every bit of the time we were there to enjoy the surroundings. We really lucked out on weather so we spent most our time outside. While we were out on the front chairs on the patio, Patsy came by to welcome us and invite us to wander the property. We were able to walk and see so many little gems and relaxing places to sit and enjoy the surroundings. We got to watch the sunset then later have s'mores in the provided fire pit. One of my most favorite parts was waking up to so much color with the sunshine making the decorated colors inside the cottage so bright."

Stayed a few nights","Patsy’s place was an absolute delight! I was traveling alone, which is unusual for me, but I felt right at home the minute I walked in! It was beautiful, airy, immaculately clean and she had thought of everything a guest might need to be more comfortable. The outside was as lovely as the inside, but I think I enjoyed the view through the large sliding doors most, of a pasture of cattle and a pond. The place is close enough to Chanute to make it easy to go into town for anything or grab a bite, but still fully out in the country-the best of both worlds!
My only regret is my husband wasn’t there to share the weekend with me as he would have loved it as much as I did!
Thank you Patsy for making my stay simply perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great little place to get away for some peaceful country living. The flowers were blooming everywhere, walks around the paths were relaxing and showed great planning of an area. The smells of her soap making business also added an enjoyable escape.
Patsy gets you started, and then makes sure your stay is a great one, with just the right amount of responsiveness and separation. She has a well thought out approach, including decor and other nice touches.
Overall, it is a great place for one or two people to get away to, with a comfortable touch of class and relaxing atmosphere. I definitely will stay again and recommend a stay!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay at Patsy's cottage. We were in town for a funeral and the peaceful surroundings at Patsy's place provided just the medicine needed for such a time as that. The cottage itself was quite beautiful and uniquely decorated. I loved the stonework and stained glass window in the bedroom area. Of all the AirBnB's I've stayed at, this has been my favorite! If you are looking for a peaceful getaway, Patsy's place should be at the top of your list."

We went in the hottest time of the summer, and the cottage's internal temperature rose to 80 when it was set to 68. Other than that, our stay was great! Patsy was very responsive and answered to all our needs. Chanute is a great, peaceful town, perfect for this peaceful stay."

I could have stayed a month, walking the beautiful grounds and enjoying nature and feeling like we were in the middle of nowhere. We ate at two different Mexican restaurants not far from the place that were FANTASTIC. We will definitely be back. Although the cottage was close to the homeowners we never saw them and they created complete privacy for us. Thank you so much!!!!"

This was an amazing place to stay and refresh our spirits and minds. My mom and I were on our way to a family bday in Kansas City. Patsy’s place was the perfect respite on our journey.
She was so generous with her time. She is truly one of the most creative and ingenuous women I’ve ever met. It seems there’s nothing she can’t do!
From beautiful gardens, to a beautiful venue, to making the most luxurious soap, to having a knack for bringing beautiful and random things together to create a place that sparks creativity, she has really excelled in making this a lovely retreat."

If you need to communicate to the world using your phone as a hotspot works. The cottage is nicely decorated and check-in and check-out are hassle free. The furniture is simple and comfy, just like home. Very nice and quiet stay. It is a very nice and quaint cottage get away and very well priced to be a bargain against other lodging available in the area. Patsy made everything happen behind the scenes and was a very good hostess."

Stayed a few nights","If you like quiet getaways that are close enough to City attractions, then you will love Patsy’s cottage at Summit Hill Gardens. Cozy, comfortable and peaceful! The cottage is just as pictured. Patsy’s soap shop is delightful and the soaps smell wonderful!
Tip#1 - In the cooler months, bring an extra blanket / personal heater if you prefer to be warm.
Tip#2- No TV or WiFi so be prepared to unplug for a few days or head to the local library if you’re desperate to get online.
Tip#3- if you like old-fashioned ice cream sodas, be sure to head into town and visit Cardinal Drugstore.
Patsy is a wonderful host! We will be returning to this charming retreat :-)"

Stayed a few nights","The place was great and Patsy was super welcoming and the soap shop was wonderful and of course we purchased some stuff. One thing that I would recommend is extra layers if you’re going to visit during cold weather because the insulation isn’t too great in the cabin. If you are someone who needs your alone time, go when the weather is nice or bring appropriate attire so you can go outside to chill because the cabin is a studio. Also the fridge is small, so keep that in mind."

We enjoyed exploring the area and the porch swings outside on a beautiful sunny day. The bed was super comfy. Loved the stained glass window and the shoe wall! Would definitelystay again!

The soap shop was well worth the visit, the bars we bought made the cabin (and our car) smell wonderful! Chanute was a wonderful town, filled with friendly people and a pleasantly diverse offering of shops and restaurants. Be sure to bring insect repellent and make time to explore the property on the bikes!"

There's a playground for the kiddos and if you have a wee one, she has a pack n play avaliable in the closet.
There's all kinds of beautiful visual treasures everywhere you look. Definitely would recommend walking around her property!
You can book with her to do wedding events too!
My absolutely favorite thing here has got to be the fact that it's in. the. CUT. Meaning that its secluded as can be. Getting away from the cities is totally worth it.
but there's anything you could need less than 15 minutes away.
Highly recommended!"

There were some plastic spoons and paper plates available, as well as plenty of coffee pods, water, and even some snack bags of chips/cookies. There is no TV or internet, and cell reception is a bit slow, which she states in her description, and we did just fine without. The grounds are gorgeous, and our 2.5 year old enjoyed playing on the slide. The host was very quick with responses to communication.

Only issue was that the stove stopped working on the first night right at dinnertime when we were about to make pasta. However, Curt came over and fixed it and was done by 9pm, which we appreciated.
Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised when the host offered to reimburse us for our pizza dinner on the night the stove malfunctioned. That was a nice gesture.
In conclusion, I would recommend this Airbnb to others looking for a great place to stay. Despite the inconvenience with the stove, this is a good spot if you're looking for a relaxing weekend in Girard."

We were just there for the night and found ourselves wishing we had more time and maybe stayed at least another night. The town of Girard is small and quaint, but we were mostly in Fort Scott for a college softball tournament, so we were about 30 minutes away. The drive was worth it but it would have been nicer if we were closer so we could have come back to the house in-between games because the house was so comfortable and cute. Thank you, Marie and Curt for sharing your home with us. The renovation and remodel you did on the house was remarkable."

The host was helpful and very understanding. I want to thank her for all the kindness she showed me for the mix up in the days rented. I would very much like to rent again as I visit my son every year. Thank You and have a good year. Christina

I had a couple of questions before our stay and Bridget was very responsive and extremely accommodating. Thank you for such a lovely experience."

We were informed of this after we Checked in and told to let them know if it was too loud, which we did, but there was no rest/sleep possible until after midnight. We wouldn’t have booked here if we had known about the outdoor party."

There are not a lot of places to stay around family in southeastern Kansas, especially with a kitchen so we can cook for my youngest with food allergies (eating out is nearly impossible unless we go to Oklahoma). This was a dream for all of us! We could cook, kids (and mom and dad) loved the coffee bar, kids loved the popcorn, we all loved the dogs, and the kids LOVED feeding the baby goats and looking for chicken eggs. The place was super clean, super nice, and you got A LOT for what we paid. We will definitely be staying here again when we visit family. Don’t pay for a hotel when you could stay here!!!"

Stayed with kids","The barndo was immaculate and comfortable. Despite being directly behind the owner’s space, it felt private and was very quiet. My kids loved checking out the horse and goats, and they made besties with the kitten who stopped by to check us out. The coffee and cocoa bar was so well stocked, and there were plentiful snacks, breakfast options, filtered water, and cooking basics. My kids loved making popcorn in the air popper and using the popcorn bags. Both beds were comfy, and the living room had three recliners, an electric fireplace, and some cozy blankets that made for a nice place to unwind and watch a movie after our drive. My kids loved playing the games that were available and I appreciated that there was plenty of space for them to get some energy out by running around outside. I can’t think of much I might have needed that wasn’t there, but I will say that my absolute favorite part was that the entire space was decorated for Christmas!"

Stayed with kids","This house was wonderful. Lots of room to visit, a spacious kitchen, comfortable beds, large patio, plenty of places to sit inside and an awesome kitchen and laundry room. Our family was in town for a reunion around the entombment of my parents cremains. It was stressful but we were able to wind down together (4 adults, 2 young people) at the end of each day. Because of the location we had gorgeous views of the night sky with little light pollution and town was within walking distance. I highly recommend booking this house if you are coming to the Cherryvale area. There are lots of things to do in the area: Fishing, hunting, historic places, and cultural events are all within walk and/or driving distance. Our family came from California, North Dakota, and Alaska and we are in consensus: this house was perfect for us in every way."

Cleverly decorated to reflect the Ranch/Barn theme with upgraded finishes. Spacious with a well stocked kitchen and comfortable beds/furniture. We were welcomed with so many “extras” including a well stocked coffee /popcorn bar & breakfast/snack items. The patio is covered, festively lit at night and set up to enjoy outdoor grilling/dining or just relaxing by the fire pit. It felt peaceful & private.
We’ve already booked again for our hunting trip in Nov/Dec."

Stayed about a week","Rented the Kusel House for a family wedding held at the Cedar Tree Barn (right around the corner) that rolled into the Thanksgiving 2023 holiday. I don't think this review captures the gratitude and appreciation our camp had for the Kusel House. Truly home away from home. G-Maps doesn't take you directly to the house using its street address. Called Kelly to find it. Each room clean, fully stocked, and equipped with strong broadcasting Wi-Fi throughout the house (huge plus). Clean, comfortable, and maintained outside deck and yards. Many people commented on the possible business connection the house has to the Cedar Tree Barn around the corner. Thoughtful decorative touches and living comforts brought back lots of family memories from our childhoods in Southeast Kansas. I thought the downstairs (mancave and bar) is where the real added value was. A gracious and thoughtful host, Kelly was quick to offer, respond, and act on our needs. Highly recommend the Kusel House."

The host and his wife were also very friendly and easy to communicate with.
If you are in the need for space in the SE Kansas area, I would strongly recommend staying here versus just another hotel. We will certainly be back."

Stayed with kids","This place was perfect for us. Its just outside of town so you get that country feel, but Wal-Mart is short drive away if you need anything. the garage was useful for storing items that I had to haul down in the back of my truck - this would have been a pain at a hotel! It has a great front porch where my sons and I played games during downtime. The pack porch has a grill and is perfect for cooking out. Parsons is my hometown but my sons have grown up in Kansas City where we have large trees and live in the middle of town - so they were especially blown away by the starry nights visible at this location. It's honestly one of the reasons I picked it, as my youngest has been working on me to look at the night sky with him. Overall a great place to stay!"

The house is comfortable, elegant in design, and clean throughout. The location is idyllic. There were five of us---two couples and one more adult---so we had maximum privacy. At least twice as many could fit with still reasonable privacy. The hot water was fine. Wi-fi worked, as did all the appliances; and utensils and such were there when we looked for them. Jessica was welcoming and always quick to reply to messages.

It was like walking in to a big warm hug or a very fancy resort. It was so relaxing after the reunion was over, as well. It is loaded with amenities and close to so many places of interest. It is worth every penny, and could so easily accommodate large family groups. We highly recommend this beautiful immaculate property that is so professionally operated."

We loved walking to the park around the block, riding scooters on the big driveway, playing ping pong in the garage. The house was lovely and clean, the beds were super comfortable, and the host left sweet little treats for my kids. :)
The only thing I would say to consider for those with little kids is that the loft area does not currently have a door (although the host said she would look into adding one) and the slats on the railing are pretty flexible wire so I was worried about our kids being up there. I believe the host was going to purchase baby gates to have so that might be a good solution.
Overall we had a wonderful stay and we hope to be back!"

The kitchen was wonderful to be able to cook in for everyone. The firepit was perfect for smores. But by far the best thing has to be the mattresses. Every bed (even the two fold out beds) were extra extra comfortable. I highly recommend this house. Jessica was a great host.

Stayed with kids","From booking through checkout this was my best experience I ever had in my 3 visits to Parsons. The description and photos of the house don’t do justice to the actual property, everything about the house was perfect for my Family. We cooked multiple meals and the kitchen had everything you can think of to cook. The beds are extremely comfortable and the HVAC kept us comfortable on all levels. The Corn hole game, grill, large TVs and backyard fire pit made for great relaxation after our family BBQ. I’ve found one of the most important factors when renting a property is the communications and responses you receive from the owner. The owner, responded immediately to every questions we had without exception. Even though we have never met personally, I felt we had made a friend. I did have a face to face conversation with one of the owners, he was there finishing some yard maintenance. It was nice to get some history. The entire experience could not have been better. Thank you Jessica"

It was clear that the owners put a lot of love and attention into making this place a unique haven. The grand entrance immediately caught our eye and set the tone for the rest of the stay. The interior was thoughtfully designed and exuded charm and character. The house was incredibly well-updated, with modern conveniences seamlessly blending with the house's historic charm. I appreciated the attention to detail and how well-maintained everything was. It truly felt like a home away from home. The hosts were exceptional. Their hospitality added an extra layer of enjoyment to our stay. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a truly unique stay"

Jessica was a very friendly host, who went above and beyond to help us feel welcome and at home. She left fresh farm eggs and a bowl full of treats for us! Park Place's location makes it easy to get to anywhere in Parsons, while also having a private feel! I would highly recommend Jessica's home for any vacation, retreat, work stay or just need a quiet place!!"

The charcoal grill in the back was nice to have and it was well-stocked with charcoal and a chimney starter. All you need is a sheet of newspaper or the equivalent to get a good fire going. Beds are very comfortable and the shower works well and is tall enough for just about anyone. Brandon is a great host and very responsive. Would stay here again on another trip to Parsons and Labette county."

Stayed a few nights","Got to the place late at night after flying in from Florida got to the home the steps are horrible going to the front door I did up tripping on the top step falling into the metal chair , hurting my shoulder and my left knee. I managed to pick myself up off the porch got inside the home in pain and then the Wi-Fi didn’t work. He said his brother over couldn’t get it fixed and then being late at night we were tired. We ended up getting a hotel room. They text me 90 minutes later saying they got the Wi-Fi fixed but we were already in the hotel room I had work I had to do I needed Wi-Fi, and now he doesn’t want to refund my money five days later I’m in a lot of pain in my shoulder and my knee. I’m thinking about contacting a personal injury attorney in Parsons. If you are a senior citizen, please be very careful going up those steps they are 3 same steps followed by a large step up in the dark, with no porch light very dangerous I do not recommend this place"

It had everything we needed, and we definitely appreciated the fenced in yard due to the awful weather while we were there (though if you have a little dog, there are a couple spots in the fence that they might be able to wiggle out of, so do keep an eye on them). Brandon was a great host, super communicative and helpful. Check-in couldn't be easier. I imagine we'll stay again for future family visits!"

It is close to the area public hunting areas and the game cleaning area is perfect for cleaning birds after a successful hunt. David is a great host and is very responsive to questions. He makes the effort to make sure everything is easy and that makes for an enjoyable stay. Hopefully we can make the trip again next year. Kansas never disappoints! Thanks again David

The tv worked better than my Roku Ultra and Firestick at home. The Wi-Fi was good enough to catch up on remote work, but it may not have been feasible to do video calls for meetings. However, it connected right away and I had no issues otherwise. We were without our kids, but this seemed like a great listing to bring children to.

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect stay for 4 adults by having 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. Very nice front porch and back porch. It was unseasonably warm, so it was nice to have a deck off the back door. We will definitely consider staying again when we are visiting Parsons."

Stayed a few nights",Brandon’s place was perfect for our stay in Parsons. We were just around the corner from where we needed to be daily so it was very convenient. My older parents had the best stay. There are a few steps up to the porch but they made it just fine. Would stay here again if back in the area.

Stayed a few nights","Responsive and accommodating. Very cute house, but it is a bit older than it looks in the photos and since it is in a more wooded area, there were some bugs inside. Just helpful to note if you're squeamish!"

Stayed with kids","Loved staying here, it felt like home away from home! This was a last minute booking so I was very grateful that the host Brandon was able to approve it so quickly. It was clean and looked just like the pictures. It’s very kid friend and spacious especially with two young children. Would definitely stay here again if I’m in town again 🙂"
