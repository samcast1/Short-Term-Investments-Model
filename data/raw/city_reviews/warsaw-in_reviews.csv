Stayed a few nights","This property was everything and more we had hoped for coming into Warsaw to visit some family. Spacious, clean, comfortable, the sun room/patio on the waterfront was the perfect spot for morning coffee.
And top notch amenities! Bikes, kayaks, cornhole.
Very well stocked kitchen which we appreciated for a couple family dinners ""at home"".
Nothing but gold stars for this place and our host Crystal, she was so helpful and communicative with us making our stay a total breeze. Looking to come back in the spring and stay here again. 100% recommend this place for families looking for a fun/relaxing space with some beautiful surroundings, thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","Crystal’s house was amazing! Super clean, spacious, great location, and the water views and fall leaves were incredible. The kitchen is huge and the island is gorgeous! Large 70” TV was perfect for watching college football during the day and a movie at night. We enjoyed sitting outside with our friends and eating soup and salad we made for dinner and soaking in the last night of warm temps while taking in the view of the lake. We enjoyed staying at Crystal’s home and would definitely stay again. She was very responsive to every question we had! Oh, did I mention how clean everything was? One more thing, our friend had Coke accidentally spilled on him at dinner and the washer and dryer were great for washing his jeans when we got back home. 😁"

Our first night in, a couple of us guests had spent a great chunk of time in the living room with easy access to the kitchen for refreshments. Having 3 bedrooms with larger beds was wonderful as well, as everyone had plenty of room to themselves for rest. I recommend wholeheartedly that the intended number of guests stay so the Cottage can be used to its fullest potential."

Stayed with kids","First and foremost, this place was clean and was stocked with anything we would need. There were even extra condiments and leftover groceries in the fridge. For me, those things are incredibly important and they were absolutely done well.
If I have one small piece of feedback, it would be the lack of TV options. We obviously didn’t stay there to watch TV, but in the evenings it’s always nice to have something on, and unfortunately there were only 5 local channels. In order to access anything else, you need an Apple ID and an iPhone. Even if you did have an iPhone, it was still challenging to get everything hooked up and working, and you had to have your own logins to anything (Netflix, Hulu, etc).
In short, most places I have stayed in have either had cable provided or a Netflix account, which would bypass the need for an iPhone and special account logins."

Stayed a few nights","This was the second time our family stayed at this cottage. It is very comfortable and feels like being at home. The location is very good. There isn't any noise in the neighborhood, you can see the lake from the front window, and it is close to everything in Lake Winona and Warsaw. The cottage is well stocked with everything you could need when away from home. One of our favorite parts of the cottage is the super cute kitchen. The appliances are very nice (so are the washer & dryer) and the kitchen made me want to cook meals. Also, the mattresses are great! We slept so well while we were there.
The only thing that was a bit of an issue is the Apple TV system. We are not familiar with Apple TV so we had issues getting used to the TV. The remote for the Apple TV also has to be plugged into a charger to work (was that way a year ago, too). It's a little annoying to have to have the remote over on the bar plugged into the charger when you are sitting on the couch wanting to change the channel. It's not a big deal, just a bit inconvenient.
Overall, my family would highly recommend this cottage when you need a place to stay in the Warsaw area."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place to stay! This cute duplex looks upon a really quiet residential neighborhood and the stunning Winona Lake. The duplex is spotless. I really appreciated the heater in the bathroom, the neutral/soothing bedding, and nicely decorated bedrooms. The kitchen was well stocked for just about anything you'd want to make. Communication is top notch. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it to any of my friends and family. It's proximity to Winona Lake is definitely a plus and Warsaw is easily accessible. It's also close to the Kosciusko Fair Grounds which is great for attending the yearly Fair or 4th of July Fireworks.
Things worth mentioning: There is a nearby Foundry and railroad track which can cause some vibrations to be felt in the house. It wasn't a big deal and there weren't any noises or weird smells.
Access to off street parking is behind some commercial buildings off Winona Avenue. Since it's behind the buildings, vehicles aren't viewable from Winona Avenue. I'd say there's enough room for two vehicles on rental's side of the parking pad. There's space for one vehicle in front of the house.
The house has a shower (no tub) so that might be helpful to know for parents of young children."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay! The decor is just as pictured. Lots of great small touches extra chargers and cords for phone and Apple Watch. Apple TV made it easy to just screen mirror from our phones to watch our own subscriptions. Brought our bikes and biked on multiple paved trails nearby. Close to the small beach lake access point to get some sun. Really close to Kroger. Loved all the kitchen amenities and had coffee on the front porch before it got too hot. Comfortable bed and felt very clean. Heater in bathroom is a nice touch. Look forward to staying again. Loved the Port Wine shop (they offer wholesale wine so it’s cheaper options and bottomless mimosas $20) Their decor at the wine shop is soooo cute. The cheese ball so good, best blue cheese olives we’ve ever had, and super friendly staff/owner. Also tried the boathouse for dinner just ok for the pricing. Had drinks at Mad Anthony Brewery downtown good local feel and really nice staff. Wanted to try the One Ten place that was recommended but didn’t realize they took reservations and were fully booked. Looked really cute and had a nice outdoor seating area. Look forward to trying other places on our next visit. Thank you!"

Penny had great decor and everything was extremely clean. She has taken care of all the small details as well. Extra towels, beach chairs, good lighting in the bedrooms along with nice sized closets and comfortable bedding made our stay very enjoyable. We stayed for a few days with our adult kids and infant grandson. Due to the current health situation we did not venture far and the home met our needs. The grill and outdoor seating area was a great touch, as was the yard. We were able to bring some yard games and enjoy some evenings out back. It was a short walk to The Village and there are a number of great restaurants nearby when we decided we didn’t want to cook."

Group trip","This place was beautiful and perfect for my sister’s bachelorette party weekend! Warsaw and Winona Lake are beautiful little tourist towns and are perfect for a weekend away if you want to take it slow for a little bit. Super cute downtown with Penny’s awesome suggestions! The only thing I wish had been different was the internet speeds. We’re a group of 7 girls that stayed who all have phones and computers, who wanted to be able to use social media to post about our weekend, download movies to watch, and to play streaming video games on my Nintendo switch. The very slow internet speeds made this difficult for us. If you don’t mind the internet speeds, then this place is perfect for you :)"

Stayed a few nights","We came to Indiana because of the death of a family member in Ft. Wayne. Although the AirBNB in Warsaw was 55 minutes drive from the funeral activities, we made a conscious decision to take advantage of the availability. The photos depicted our real-life expectations. The decor and environment allowed us to relax, reflect, and reminiscence. In fact, my cousin fell in love with the place and wanted to rent it for life. The unexpected basic food items and surplus of various food and beverage items, along with fully stocked linen closet and everything needed to make the stay comfortable and convenient added to an enjoyable stay. Will definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","The PRO's, close to the lakefront beach, a few local eateries, and 10min drive from the Winona Lake Trails which was AWESOME and recommended by our host. The condo was VERY luxurious and we felt right at home. The only few downsides which are out of the control of our host were: the street noise to due some motorcycle groups that revved up their bikes insanely high, No TV's in the bed rooms so you will go to sleep fast, and the dang freight trains that rolls through town at 1, 3, and 5am. Not sure if the train companies hate Warsaw, but they get on that horn and it will wake you up if you're a light sleeper. However, the place is AWESOME and the price was so worth it! I would recommend this host and her place to anyone."

The beds were sooo comfortable...even the roll away bed! We had everything we needed to make meals, a small coffee maker and a couple snacks were left for us. There were little extras in the bathroom too, in case we forgot something. Very thoughtful:) Having a washer and dryer in unit was really convenient. Plenty of extra pillows, bathrobes...I could go on. Amy obviously pays attention to detail. Parking is easy (we always had a space out front) and the building itself was easy to find and enter. Plenty of restaurants nearby in this charming neighborhood. I highly recommend!"

Checking in was a breeze and the loft has a well stocked kitchen, the bathrooms are clean and the shower head in the master bath was divine, and the bed……….so very comfortable……….and, there is a white noise machine in the master which is awesome because I’m accustomed to sleeping with some sort of white noise.
With its downtown location it provides the opportunity to walk to many places.
Warsaw is my hometown and my Mother, sisters, brothers, aunts and cousins all live there. I plan to stay at Amy’s Lux Loft the next time I travel to Warsaw."

Immaculately clean. Very well stocked in terms of both kitchen and bathroom amenities. Nice furniture, very comfortable beds. Genuinely beautiful apartment.
As mentioned in the description, it’s a walk up, and no parking, but neither is a big deal. We parked directly out front and there were dozens of empty spots within a couple blocks. (It’s downtown Warsaw, you know - there’s infinite parking). As for the walkup, there were maybe 20 steps. We had our kids and a lot of luggage and it was no issue.
I would stay here again if it were in any city. Considering the mediocre hotel options in Warsaw it’s an extraordinarily good option and terrific value."

I always appreciated her quick response to any questions we had before and during our trip. The location of the home in Winona truly cannot be beat- walking distance to everything the village has to offer! Adding this to our list of places to return to stay at when in Winona.

Crystal was easy to reach and always responded in a very timely manner. She was extremely flexible when we notified her a couple days before our arrival that we wished to arrive and check-in a day early.
I would live to stay here again when the weather is warmer so I could do some more walking in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Loved the house and the location!! This was my first visit to Winona Lake and I will definitely be back! Because it is a small town, you will want to check on the hours of any store or restaurant in the area. If not busy they will close early. Cerulean is a great, local restaurant and the staff is amazing! The cocktails served in the bar are custom elixirs and well thought out for the palette! Goat Cheese and Pepper Jelly with Toast Points is a wonderful starter. I would also recommend popping into the Port Winona Wine & Market. They have Wine, Craft Beers in a Can, and lunch selections. I had the Caprese Pasta Salad and a glass of Peach Sangria then took a seat on the porch. The best part of the day though is the Sunsets!!! Do not miss this on a nice day!! The colors off the beach are incredible. If you are bringing family, there are Pontoon Boat and Kayak Rentals at the Boathouse, but you will want to reserve in advance on holiday weekends. Cannot say enough! Loved It!"

Our home for the weekend was very clean, had everything we needed and decorated very nice. Bed was very comfortable and landscaping was done beautifully! They even loaned us their kayaks to use for our last day! Not sure when we will make it back to Indiana, but if we do we will definitely stay again!"

The weather outside was extremely cold but inside was nice and cozy. We would definitely return.

The place had everything I needed and was so comfortable, clean and very well appointed. Greg and Charlene were both incredibly responsive and welcoming.

The hosts are so hospitable, quick to reply with any question or concern, and prioritize making your stay special.

Comfortable and amazingly clean, filled with lots of thoughtful touches like a jar of lemon drops on the writing desk, an umbrella just in case, brochures for local attractions and so much more. The location is amazing - in the center town, overlooking a gorgeous park and pond with a fountain, an easy walk to fabulous dining, shopping, and outdoor activities. Winona is a completely charming town with lots to do, ideal for families or couples. Charlene is a most friendly, accommodating hostess, making an otherwise first-rate experience over-the-top! Wow."

We rented both suites. One for my parents and one for my husband, daughter and me. They were exactly as pictured; super adorable, spacious, clean with a great view of the park. Also, it’s walking distance to pretty much anything in the town, including the lake. Greg and Charlene were great hosts and even left water for us upon arrival. We enjoyed our stay very much!

The tasteful decor and nautical details were in tune with the theme of an ideal lakeside retreat. If you love taking in the outdoors, their back patio is the perfect spot to read a book or just gaze out and appreciate nature at its finest. We also enjoyed the locally made hand soap in the bathroom that smelled divine!
Winona Lake and the Village shops at Winona were a mere 8 minutes away from the Guesthouse, thus making it easily accessible by foot to go around and explore this beautiful town.
We’re hoping to come back in the summer months when the town is more active and alive. Check out the Guesthouse on Terrace. It’s absolutely worth booking."

Stayed with kids","This was a nice upstairs apartment. The space was tidy and clean and located in a nice area of town with a very short walk to a small park. The price is definitely reasonable for what you get. I would give a 5 star review BUT…it’s not suitable for 8. It’s not even suitable for 6. While there’s plenty of space in the apartment, it is not properly furnished. 2 queen beds and a futon realistically can only sleep 6 (our party of 6 had some on the floor because the futon is small). Also, the living room only has a futon for seating. 3 can sit, which means everyone else is on the floor. Again, clean space at a good price (and you even get a bottle of wine), but you might consider bringing folding chairs and sleeping bags."

Stayed one night","Jonathan was extremely helpful and kind with my questions before and during our stay. Everything was clean and well kept. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the Airbnb was described as a whole house, and it felt a bit misleading. There are the components of a whole house (kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms, living areas, etc), but the actual “house” was divided up into 2 , maybe 3 apartments total. We could hear some noise from either television or people talking in the apartment below and we also felt weird playing our music/watching tv because we didn’t want to disrupt them as well. Jonathon was super helpful and informative about the Airbnb in all other areas, I just feel like this could have been better explained in the description."

When we first arrived at the cottage, it looked smaller on the outside than we expected.....but when we opened the door----WOW!!! It was so nice and I loved the decor. We loved the fireplace and back deck.
The special touches in the cottage is what impressed us the most. Sadly, it was chilly and raining during our stay, but we look forward to booking again to enjoy the kayaks and paddle boat.

Stayed a few nights",We had a great time staying in this little cabin. It was very very clean and it was very nice of David to provide a free bottle of wine for us upon arriving. We loved the cute little town and the hiking trails that are within walkable distance. It was a little tough to find at first as it is down a very small ally way. The only thing I do not like about the house is that all the neighbors are looking directly into your windows although this can be easily fixed by closing the blinds! Overall we had a great stay and I would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area.

Stayed one night","Right on the alley and surrounded by houses making it a little tight. Large back yard, and deck. Very nice house. Loved the kitchen. Couple of extra spices such as garlic and onion would be helpful, as well as lids for the pans. I should've inquired as to the types of pans as we do not like to cook in non stick. We would've brought our own. Bedroom was just right. Bed fairly comfortable. I didn't like that the laundry room was steps from bed so strong detergent smell was present. Some folks are sensitive to strong smells. Living room was nice and comfortable. Bathroom is very small but nice, a bigger person would have a hard time getting around in it. Amenities listed but not available; conditioner, shower gel, missed the cooking oil I guess. Beach, lake and scenic view are close by but not available from house. We walked to canal and lake from Social(yummy ice cream), 1/2 mile away. Views are amazing! David was very prompt to answer my questions. We enjoyed our stay, not enough time!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful little home close to walking trails and the lake. The quality of the build/remodel is evident, and the furniture and finishings are so nice. Bed and sofa are both very comfortable; everything felt brand new. The restroom was modern and clean, but it’s a tight fit with the toilet. I did okay but a large person would have trouble. The complimentary bottle of wine was a fun surprise, and there’s a little coffee pot and things for coffee. The kitchen is decently equipped for a newer listing, but no spices yet. The house is tucked away in an alley behind the larger houses. It was just fine in such a lovely neighborhood but the house across the way was under construction. So sleeping in and afternoon naps and sitting on the front porch were problematic some days. Social Ice Cream Shop was worth the daily walk for AMAZING ice cream!
David and his property will quickly be a Superhost listing. I look forward to staying again - especially when the construction is complete."

We had a fantastic time at Eagle Creek!
Everything was so cozy and convenient and perfectly placed. The house is absolutely stunning and has every single thing we needed. You can tell this host is extremely thoughtful about everyone’s needs.
The property is so charming with the train and creek right behind.
We brought up our kayaks and kayaked for hours through the creek… it was wonderful. 👌🏼
We could not have asked for a better weekend getaway and better host.
No complaints, whatsoever.
We will be back, for sure!!! 😘"

Group trip",Stephen was hands down thee best Host of a vacation rental I've ever had. He was extremely responsive and friendly. The house was easy to find and looked exactly as pictured. It worked well for our group staying to celebrate graduation. It's location was great for the University/restaurants etc. The house was well equipped for cooking and hosting a group. Bedrooms were comfortable and all had bathrooms which was great. Just a few negatives. 1.) The house had well water and had a very strong smell/taste. 2.) There is a train track approx. 100 feet from the back of the house where several trains went by daily. That being said it didn't really bother us or keep us up. 3.) Some of the bathroom fixtures/vanities/ etc. were a bit dated and shabby. Maybe time for a refresh. The glass door on the showerin the loft bedroom didn't slide well and the showered has seen better days. In spite of these few negatives the house was great. We enjoyed our time there and would recommend it. Stephen thanks

We watched movies, prepared tasty food & drinks (loved the tea cups), played board games/pool, and viewed the eclipse. The back deck is lovely, had a great time watching and listening to the wildlife. Our time spent in this space making memories was magical! Simply the BEST!
Train Note: No one in our party was bothered by the humming of the passing trains, it added to the experience. Stephen did have cute little earplugs packs available if needed, but we didn't. :)"

Stayed about a week","The pictures don’t lie, this is a beautiful, tasteful, cozy place to spend your time. There are thoughtful touches throughout. You are right on the creek, and surrounded by trees even though you’re at the end of a regular neighborhood block with easy access to Warsaw. It’s the best of both secluded and easy-commutes. Stephen is a very attentive and kind host and when a problem popped up, glue was very quick to handle it. I would easily recommend this spot to friends. The only hiccup would be stairs, but that’s clear from the photos.
If you’re a train enthusiast, this place is even better because the tracks are across the creek.
We have kids with sensory issues so I was wondering how they’d handle this place, but the house is quiet, and a lot of the things Stephen added made that even better.
And, our dog loved being able to hang out with us, too."

The space was clean. The beds were comfortable. The house had a ton of space, so we plan to come back with family for another long weekend.
The location was a short drive to Winona Lake and other esteemed Warsaw restaurants. We loved all the restaurants and shops we visited.
As a host, Stephen was also very friendly and communicative. Our checkin process was easy, and all his instructions were thorough.
Would definitely recommend staying with him if you’re looking for a getaway in the Warsaw/Winona Lake area. We can’t wait to go back!"

She really provided us a wonderful, memorable, and comfortable stay.

This condo exceeded all expectations. It was beautifully done, with stunning views and the high ceilings and multiple levels made it seem enormous. Our one regret is that the weather was too cold (single digits with wind chill in the negative teens several days) that we couldn't use the rooftop deck to enjoy the 360 degree views of the downtown and surrounding area. We'll save that for another trip when weather is warmer, as we will be back for visits with family and this will be our first choice for accommodations. Several very good restaurants within a block or two, and a nice coffee shop (Courthouse Coffee) right next door at street level. Rebecca was a terrific host - very responsive and compassionate - we could not have asked for more."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed here for an anniversary getaway. We really loved it! The location was close to restaurants. We walked to the Downtown Eatery, Mad Anthony's Brewery, and 110 Meatery and had amazing meals at each. The airbnb itself was super unique being in a historic building. Inside it was very clean and comfortable. Very cozy and nice for a winter getaway. Already looking into coming back in the summer to use the rooftop grill! Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was very pleasant. We were in town to see a show at Wagon Wheel Theater. What a great venue for theater! Rebecca's apartment was so comfortable. It is a restored Mason Hall or building, with beautiful wood work. Couch in living room was great for all of us to talk and lounge. She left lots of nice snacks and lots of coffee pods. Nice beds, linens, and towels. I give it a 5 star review. Now, just one really picky point . . . you cannot use the tap water for coffee. So, it would have been nice if the host would leave a bottle of water you can use for your 1st morning of coffee. There is an awesome restaurant right downstairs, farm to table. Great food and service. also, a coffee shop below. We will definitely stay again if back in Warsaw."

This condo was a lovely respite from running around town all day. I was in awe of the tall ceilings, windows and doors which look to be restored from long ago. The place had everything I needed, kitchen, washer and dryer etc. Everything was super new and clean. I had a couple of small glitches while I was there but Rebecca couldn't have been more responsive. For some reason the door code was never emailed to me but Rebecca responded right away and I had no trouble getting in. There is plenty of space for a family - I think you could possible fit 6 people but it was only me so I had plenty of space!! I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Great location and fabulous, spacious place with a wonderful layout and furnishings! The primary bedroom is super comfortable - one of the best I've ever stayed. Unfortunately the elevator was broken, so it was a hike up and down stairs the entire visit. But the host was very responsive and apologetic, and she proactively made appropriate adjustments to accommodate the inconvenience, which we really appreciated. There were lots of unused products and toiletries left either by the host or previous guests for future guest use, which was really nice and convenient. There were a couple of nit-picky things specific to the kitchen, such as only one frying pan in the entire kitchen and no toaster. Overall an incredibly positive experience! I would highly recommend staying here, and I would absolutely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at this location over Christmas weekend with three generations of family. The location and size of the condo make it a perfect launching point for weekends in Warsaw, IN. Even though it was the beginning of winter, we enjoyed the proximity to everything and really enjoyed the feel of our surroundings. The ceilings must be well over 10' and the windows make you feel like you're outdoors. The loft space is great to tuck your kids away in the evening for a romantic evening alone. I hesitated to write this review because I'd like to keep it secret for our weekends when we visit family in the future. Sadly, I'll tell you the reader this is the best place in town, don't bother with hotels as they don't come close to the accommodations of this place offers."

Extra Super cute cottage, perfect size, impeccably clean, endless “extras” that we have yet to see anyplace else. Just like being at home, but better with the trail right behind. Walking almost everywhere was really sweet & added to our delightful experience. Lake Winona area has rich history & it’s friendly community vibe almost makes it feel somewhat surreal.
The hosts truly care, are kind & friendly, and put their heart into making the cottage feel like home. Thank you for the sweet memories 😊"

Rob had prepared an outdoor fire with wood already to go. We just had to light it and enjoy. We did. We celebrated our 36th anniversary at The Pass. It was just perfect! Everyday we were there we used the trail behind the house to go for a walk. We enjoyed that as well. There were sculptures along the walking trails. Those were nice. The lake is beautiful. We hadn't seen a cleaner lake in awhile.
The whole package just made our stay at Randa's and Robs. We will be back."

The bed was very comfortable and the front porch rocking chairs were perfect for enjoying our morning coffee.

Stayed a few nights","We HIGHLY recommend Randa & Rob’s Off the Beaten Pass cottage! This was our first time in the Winona Lake area and ALSO our first time using air bnb. We did not know what to expect so when we showed up to this absolutely adorable home, we knew we hit the jackpot of hosts. If you love attention to detail, you will enjoy EVERY perfectly placed detail here. From opening the door and smelling a meticulously clean, neat and organized home to the personalized touches such as a welcome board with our names and a sweet message to greet us, we were incredibly impressed. There are guides with local information, plus, Randa was available and so hospitable to answer all of our questions and share how to make the most of our weekend. We do not have anything to compare this air bnb too, but I’m afraid Randa & Rob have set the bar very high for any future air bnb hosts we use! The only thing that would make our experience better is for Randa to do a consultation on how to stage and decorate our own home in Annapolis Maryland! This property sits next to a beautiful and convenient paved trail that is a short walk to the Village of Winona and Grace College. We were visiting Grace College and this is better than any hotel stay we could have chosen, so close and one of the most well thought out use of spaces. There were only two of us but our family of 5 would have been able to stay very comfortably. Choose Off the Beaten Pass and you will not be disappointed!"

A fenced back yard keeps walkers out of your space. The front porch has rockers, the back deck has a table and chairs for relaxing. We were awakened to the birds singing and entertained by the beautiful black squirrels that played in the side yards. This place is quiet and peaceful and also allows easy access to shops on the lake. This was my second stay there and I highly recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","Randa and Rob were fantastic hosts. They have earned their designation as “Super Hosts” with Airbnb. The entire process went very smoothly. Rob and Randa are remodeling a property next to the cottage in which we were staying. The gave us our space and privacy but did meet with us to ensure we had no problems and had everything we needed. They were friendly, welcoming and informative.
The cottage was beautifully decorated and contained everything we needed to make our stay restful and enjoyable. There were so many little touches that both added to the aesthetic beauty of the cottage and its utility.
Lake Winona is a charming lake community with parks, beaches, trails and interesting shops. The town of Warsaw has a historic district which includes an impressive county courthouse. We hiked several miles of the “Heritage Trail” which runs within a few feet behind the cottage. Whether you want to relax or play, there is something for everyone.
I recommend the hosts and the property to anyone. We absolutely loved our stay."

It is also wonderfully located next to the bike/walk path and near to the shops and restaurants in town. It was a welcome escape from the city, and Randa was a warm and responsive host.

It a gem right off of a walking path that leads to the public park on the lake. Randa went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. Would highly recommend"

Loved the fireplace that provides some extra warmth on a snowy or rainy day, and loved the comfy bed and all the nice touches with treats and options like the fire pit and corn hole game or enjoying the front or back porches. Convenient parking is at the front porch and the Heritage Trail is close to your back door for awesome hiking or biking. It's just a short walk to the Winona Village as well as the gorgeous lake. The owners are so kind and ready to assist with anything, but you may not have any needs as they have already provided so much. Enjoy this very nice spot to get away."

If you're looking for relaxation, everything you could ever need already stocked in the house, beautiful sights, a grocery only 10 minutes away by bike, trails, swans, a cozy fireplace, an amazing bonfire, awesome artful touches throughout, black squirrels, and the friendliest trail walkers ever, this place is for you. We cannot emphasize this enough, leave your car parked and take to foot or bike! Off The Beaten Pass is a healing space. Leave your tech on the table and hit the trails. Come back to a fire, a movie, a good book, and peace. Thank you Randa & Rob!!"

The decor is spectacular from the moment you step onto the porch down to every little detail inside. The outdoor space is particularly charming and the perfect place to relax, we especially enjoyed the back deck and fire pit. Backing up to the paved walking/biking path was a special treat. It took us less than 10 minutes to walk to the lake or into town and you can access the mountain biking trails right from this path. It's so quiet and peaceful with plenty of parking so there's literally nothing to worry about. We can't wait for another visit!"

Comfortable bedding and plenty of extra blankets and towels if needed. Only thing I would mention is the covered parking was too low for our larger SUV. Not an issue for us but something to be aware of if you drive a taller vehicle.

The place might be a bit small for a group trip for an extended amount of time, but it was the perfect size for a family with small kids. We look forward to staying again."

Stayed a few nights","I was traveling with 3 other colleagues on a work trip to visit Grace College in Winona Lake. Amy was very communicative and even messaged us that we could check in at any time since the house was clean. Amy provided local dining recommendations and her favorite dishes on a print out at the Airbnb. We went to Cerulean and it was delicious! Prior to booking, I hadn't paid much attention to the size of the home. It is pretty tight and you can definitely hear others moving around in the hallways or going to the bathroom since the door is a little squeaky. The home is also close to a fire station, so it can be a little bit noisy if you are a light sleeper. The home is decorated nicely, clean, and updated. We enjoyed being able to watch a movie on the tv as there was a guest account on their streaming service. This home is within walking distance of a Kroger and only a 7 minute drive from the adorable town or Winona Lake."

We were happy that there were some snacks available to munch on. We appreciated that. The place is right by Kroger for groceries and walking distance from Walgreens. The price was really reasonable as well.
Short drive to a lake and lots of nice places. We were there for a wedding so didn't get to do a lot of exploring. But I wouldn't mind returning again!
We didn't really need to contact Amy, but she let us know someone would be there to mow the lawn so we weren't surprised. She was a great host!

Lots of great amenities in this Airbnb; always clean upon arrival, kitchen is well stocked with everything you need (and I cook 3 meals a day in it), lots of seating (enough for 6 comfortably), the bathroom is nice, the beds are super comfortable, there’s covered parking for 1 vehicle, check-in and check-out are easy. Amy is GREAT, very accommodating, easy to reach out to. We have stayed at this Airbnb twice, it’s our go-to for Warsaw. We’ll be back in May!!"

I loved this house. Wish we didn't have to leave. If we are ever back in the area we will definitely be booking this house again. Absolutely loved it.

Stayed with kids","We loved staying at Amy's beautiful and comfy place! It was very clean and the location was perfectly situated to be close to our family living in Warsaw. We especially liked the comfortable and well-appointed living room and kitchen area. The sofa was especially comfortable and the kitchen had plenty of dishes and pots and pans stocked to be able to prepare meals while staying there. We also appreciated all of Amy's extra touches - the snacks and treats, the variety of coffees and teas, extra towels, laundry detergent available- all to make our stay that much more pleasant! We used the washer and dryer once and it worked beautifully. The memory foam bed was too soft for us but the beds in the two other bedrooms were very comfortable! We had one small issue at the beginning of our stay but Amy responded quickly and made sure to have the problem remedied beyond our satisfaction. She is an exemplary host and went above and beyond to make our stay a pleasant one! Two other things: I noticed that one review mentioned that there wasn't a table to eat at but Amy has added a very nice table and two chairs in the living area (and two additional folding chairs are also available in one of the bedroom closets) and she also made sure to have a full length mirror added in one of the bedrooms after I inquired before our stay if there was any other place with a mirror besides the bathroom to be able to do hair or apply make up. Our stay was simply wonderful and we look forward to staying at Amy's place again!"

Stayed with kids","Host was very accomodating and responsive. The home was in a good location with easy access to a lot of restaurants and groceries. The home is not really set up well for airbnb, especially a long term rental, in my opinion. There was no kitchen table, just 2 stools at the counter so my family of four had challenges at every meal time. Not a big deal for a night or two but not ideal for a long term stay. Kitchenware was not thought through: missing kitchen staples and a hodge podge of items. I did purchase a few things I needed and left them for the next guests. Small drains and no disposal. Again, fine for short term but a pain for long term. The heat was by far our biggest issue though. The one bedroom gets insanely hot while the rest of the house stayed pretty cold due to how the vents are set up. I purchased deflectors but they didn't work. Won't be an issue for warmer months."

Stayed one night","What a very nice stay! The over-the-garage apartment was clean, comfortable and well thought out with everything you might need for practicalities and comfort and they go out of their way to provide small touches and amenities to make you feel welcome and cared for.
It is on a corner lot on a well-traveled country road literally in the middle of a cornfield but only 5 minutes from a major grocery and restaurants and 10-15 from the Village shops around Winona Lake. I was there in early October when the field was being harvested until around 9:30 at night by a huge combine. It was interesting to watch. Although the traffic and combine outside could be loud at times, it was quiet and peaceful inside and the bed was nice and comfortable.
I would highly recommend and will stay again the next time I return to Warsaw."

It is only reachable by a long set of stairs, but I needed the exercise! It has everything necessary in a home away from home. I especially appreciated the streaming TV and the WiFi. It’s not far from downtown Warsaw, while still feeling like it’s out in the country. The proprietors were very friendly and helpful, and I always felt safe In knowing they were nearby if I needed them. I’ll definitely stay at Heritage House again next time I’m in town!"

We wanted a place away from the city that was cozy for reading, relaxing, and just chilling. This was perfect for the two of us. The coffee bar was a bonus we loved! It's an affordable & nice sized space too. The sink & toilet area is separate from the shower area which I thought was great for two people getting ready in the morning. Lots of extra blankets, hangers, towels, and extras are available for guests. The sunroof windows offer lots of light, a view of the countryside & barn while still allowing privacy. We'll have to come back again!"

It's a cozy and comfortable space, just right for a solo (or couple) wanting to get away. Anywhere you might want to go in the Warsaw/Winona Lake area is within quick driving distance, and there is a Meijer just a few minutes away in case you might have forgotten to pack something! The space is well-stocked with dishes and cookware, plus complimentary coffee and tea, and everything is clean and tidy. Definitely recommend it for a stay!"

There is a small bedroom and a sliding privacy door which separates it from the living room/kitchen area. There was coffee and tea that was complimentary.

The only note is that the shower might be a tight fit for someone 6'1"" or taller."

Stayed a few nights",Our stay was within ten minutes of Grace College and Seminary which was very important to us. We also enjoyed that it was close to the Village at Winona Lake. Check-in was a breeze and we found the space very clean and inviting. Amanda has thought of everything to make your stay perfect. We highly recommend her as a host.

Stayed about a week","At the top of a farmhouse not far from town, Amanda's private apartment was a perfect home away from home. She and Chloe were very helpful to me during my trip, as I searched to extend my stay. The apartment was very clean and contained all the creature comforts anyone might need (e.g., coffee, tea, condiments, diffuser, soft blankets, cushy towels, filtered water, fully-equipped kitchen). I'll be back for sure!"

Stayed about a week","Wow, is the feeling that radiate thru when you enter the apartment. A true home away from home. If you have ever traveled to Europe you understand how a small space is maximize to its full potential. The host are absolutely amazing, so helpful with advice concerning permanent living quarters . I relocated to the area for work.
Martins is 3mins away with a great deli , fresh produce and a Starbucks inside. Yes :-) . The Asian Cajun restaurant was fantastic and you can get a free pass at the gym or pay 8$ at a beautiful YMCA . All within drum roll please......3 to 9mins top by car. Oh and Chicago union station is 2hrs away....GREAT LOCATION.
Thank you John and Amanda 😊"

The space itself was immaculately tidy and included everything we needed and more! There was even an air purifier and diffuser with essential oils that helped us sleep great. If we ever come back to this small town, we’d definitely stay here again."

The space was inviting, comfortable, and felt very homey. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone. Why choose a hotel when you could stay in a private, quiet place like this overlooking a beautiful country field? It’s super close to Warsaw so it’s a no brainer!"
