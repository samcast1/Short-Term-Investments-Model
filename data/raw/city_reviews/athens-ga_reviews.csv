Stayed one night","Olen's place was located in a beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood, and it just gets better when you go inside. They have given so much attention to every detail, but the centerpiece of it all is the incredibly comfortable, luxurious king sized bed! Really hated leaving that bed for the long drive home! Really appreciated the coffee and add-ins, oatmeal, hot and cold water dispenser, the detailed directions for everything and more... Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my 2-night stay at Olen's place in late April. It was clean as a whistle, private, comfortable, and very peaceful. His directions to me, along with help from my GPS, were spot-on, which was important since I arrived after dark. If you're unfamiliar with Athens, I'll tell you that the entrance to Olen's subdivision is off the Jefferson Highway, just a few miles outside the bypass. It's worth noting that the house is in the very back of the subdivision, and it is among the nicest houses in the subdivision. Once I looked at the pictures and again confirmed I was at the right address, I pulled right in and parked just a few feet from the door. I didn't have any problem backing down the driveway in the morning. From Olen's, it's no more than 15-20 minutes to the heart of the UGA campus, which is what brings most folks to Athens anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."

Stayed one night","My stay here was absolutely wonderful! The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and the whole vibe of the atmosphere was phenomenal! I really appreciated the amenities, because the night of my stay, my husband and I went to eat prior to coming to this Airbnb. In the middle of the night, I had a SERIOUS case of acid reflux, and it was so great have the mints and hot water all ready available so that I could quickly do what I could to take care of that horrible feeling. My ONLY concern was the height of the bed. I am super short and had to climb to get to the bed, but I am short so everyone obviously will not have that issue, like my husband. However, I brought that attention to Olan and I know that they will be willing to take care of that small con. The overall area was SUPER quiet and calm. The organization was great also! I will definitely be staying here again!!"

A quiet, clean and comfortable retreat to decompress and relax after a long day with the fam!

Stayed one night","I had an amazing stay! I stayed for one night with my mom and the airbnb was exactly as pictured and described. In addition, it was very clean!! As someone who dislikes how hotel sheets (especially pillow cases!) and towels can be dirty and full of lint, you will NOT find that here. The bed, bath, closet, and overall area was very clean. I'd also like to note that when waking up, neither my mom or I, woke up with that stuffy grimy feeling you get when you stay at some hotels (or even some airbnbs) which was great! Lastly, we did wake up very early around 6am and i had messaged Olen a question and i was nervous i might have texted too early to the point i might have not gotten a response before checkout but Olen was able to immediately respond! Overall, totally recommend Olen's place and he was a good host."

Stayed a few nights","Had a lovely stay at the Classic City Suites…it was a 7 minute drive from Bishop Park where I was exhibiting as an artist. I’m super picky about decor and linens as a designer and everything in Olen’s place felt clean and modern.
I’m an AWFUL car backer-outter as it turns out so next time I may just park on the road, but that’s my own issue lol. The extra touches were nice (fridge/micro/coffee and creamer/makeup wipes) and checkout instructions were clear and easy. Would highly recommend for someone just needing a soft landing place to sleep between activities!"

Stayed a few nights","Great stay, but knocking off a star for underwhelming internet speeds and cell service which wasn’t good for a remote worker like me who always need to be connected. Shower also had hair from someone else. I’ve also never seen check out rules where the host threatens to leave guests a negative review because they don’t remove a pillow case and put it in the laundry. Usually that is the hosts’ responsibility. Otherwise, the bed was pretty comfy."

The only problem we had was there is a large curb at the end of the driveway and it scrapped along the bottom of my car when pulling in and out. I drive a small car and an SUV would not be affected. We were in town for a college visit and if our child decides to go to UGA I would definitely stay here again.

Thoughtful touches from decor to necessities you may have forgotten were stocked. We weren't comfortable with the Alexa we had to use for lighting because we don't use that in our home, but it's probably a great touch for others. Olen was kind and communicative.

I think my only note would be that the location is a bit father out of town than I was anticipating. It took approximately 15-20 mins during peak hours to get to downtown Athens. I only saw the host once which, in my opinion, is how I prefer my Airbnb stays to go aka fairly private. The room was decked out in Athens decor which I loved. I would stay again!"

The room is attached to his house so you can hear some noises from the house but we didn’t mind that. If you are traveling alone it might be reassuring to know someone is so close by. It has its own entrance on the side. The room is small but comfortable. We were out & about all day so the size didn’t matter to us. You definitely need a car to get to town.

Stayed a few nights","So, this was a solo stay as I was int own for a conference and wanted to avoid the 1.5 hour drive to and from my home for three days. This ended up being a fantastic choice for me, as the location is perfect, feeling far enough from the city and also so close to everything. The neighborhood is absolutely adorable and there is plenty of wildlife and walking nearby if that is something you are interested in. The amenities are exactly as presented as well as extra little touches that I didn't know I needed. The room was spectacularly clean, as I am somewhat of a germaphobe, and the bed/ linens/ and mattress were amazing. I would recommend this property to anyone I now and will also keep it as my first option when visiting Athens again. Also, the owner was very easy to communicate with, and while I did not have any problems during my stay, I would have felt comfortable enough to reach out with any needs."

Stayed one night","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Shirley's place. It was very peaceful and calm. I was actually in Athens to take a professional exam and my stay attributed to the calm energy I had to take my exam! I later found out that I passed at the professional level!! YAY!
My ONLY and I mean ONLY con to this stay was the parking situation. I am so glad I know the area so I knew exactly where to go/shortcuts. The parking suggested by Shirley was at least a block away. I know for
most that would not be a problem, but this AirBNB is in the city of Athens. I could imagine feeling unsafe walking to/from the parking deck with a bunch of bags late at night or early in the morning as a solo traveler. Although I was given the option to put the emergency lights and pick up my stuff upon check out due to me asking if I could do so, when I checked in, I walked with big bags to the AirBNB and I did not appreciate that. Thank goodness it did not rain like it had planned to..
Other than that...GREAT STAY!!"

The unit is well done and comfortable, and after an initial cleaning hiccup, was spic and span.

The location is in the middle of downtown, making it walking distance to all restaurants and shops. There's a Target right next to the building entry doors for any amenities you may have forgotten to pack. Great wifi. Hosts provide very clear instructions and are proactive in communicating back to you in a timely manner.
I highly recommend this appt and had a great time!!"

Just what your looking for if your coming to Athens and are simply looking for a nice, neat, place to sleep and wake up in between exploring the city. Parking deck, mentioned in the listing, is close by, easy to navigate, and walkable with your luggage if you can’t pull up out front to unload.
Would definitely stay here again for a weekend trip to Athens."

I turned to Airbnb and found Michael and Suzanne’s listing. After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I booked! We were so relieved to arrive and find that everything was exactly as described and most importantly, safe, private and clean. The hosts were very responsive to my couple of inquiries upon check in. The stay was very comfortable and the hosts had truly anticipated most any need a guest could have - impressively even up to stadium bags if you were going to a game.

I came for 3 days for work and plan on returning for a whole week. Michael and Suzanne were wonderful goats that make you feel right at home. Even a Buckeye can appreciate a Dawgs taste."

Stayed a few nights","We checked into the “Dawg Suite” late afternoon on July 20 for a 4 night stay. Directions were perfect and check-in was easy. The neighborhood was beautiful and the “suite” was as pictured. We unloaded our vehicle, put food in the fridge, and started to put our clothes away when a storm started to blow in and intensify with 70 mph winds. Power was knocked out. This is when the best part of our stay began as Suzanne reached out to us and kept us up to date on the prognosis for power restoration. It would be 24 hours before power was restored but communication from Suzanne was exemplary, making sure we were ok. The suite was clean and comfortable. The shower was forceful and hot (once the power was restored). The 5 Points location made all our destinations easy to get to. Suzanne and Michael went “above and beyond” during a difficult situation. Kudos to you both."

This particular location came up first in my search and I couldn’t have been more happy with my choice. The accommodations and amenities were more than welcoming. Quaint kitchen, excellent water pressure/temperature for the shower, very comfortable bed, and easy-to-follow instructions placed in each room.
The neighborhood was very quaint and comfortable, perfect to come home to after a long day. Very close to bars/restaurants.
Would gladly recommend this location to anyone else looking for a wonderful stay in the area!"

We had plenty of lush towels and washcloths, and had most of what we needed to cook with. We forgot to bring oil or butter, and Suzanne very kindly brought us a stick of butter to cook with! The whole space was very clean, with only very mild cleaning product smells (I really appreciate this). I would gladly recommend this property to anybody who wants to spend a few days visiting Athens. Thank you, Michael and Suzanne!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is really great and checks all the important ‘Excellent Airbnb’ boxes: SUPER comfortable bed, like all-around top notch, Smart TVs that are easy to work, towels that are quite possibly the best thing I’ve ever smelled, (I want to know this laundry magic!) make-up towels, an excellent shower with lots of hot water, enough decorations so it feels homey without feeling like someone’s home, and a well-stocked kitchen with Brita water (nice!) and snacks and laundry machines. Oh and it smells really good, too!
Stay here and you can be one of the first to discover this new Athens gem!"

The space is well appointed with a lot of nice touches including filtered water, cold sparkling water in the fridge, fans, etc.! The biggest drawback of our stay: there is central air conditioning, but the guests cannot control the temperature, and instead have to message the host to request adjustments. The host was very responsive, however it was pretty warm outside during our stay and even with the fans provided and requests to turn the AC cooler, the room was uncomfortably hot almost the entire duration of our stay. We would stay again, but only during the fall/winter :)"

The room was large enough for the two of us for the weekend. The small refrigerator, microwave and assortment of tea and cold bubbly water was very welcoming for a short stay.

Location, safety, beauty, ease, amenities, and the most amazing vibes from the art, mosaics and room decor. I'm a single woman traveling cross country and this was BY FAR the best stay I've had. I walked to town twice and walked on the nearby trails to enjoy the river and the woods. I felt extremely safe and tended to and Krysia had lots of recommendations for fun and live music and creative play time. The value of this space is extra awesome. You won't regret this stay.

Stayed one night","I can't believe I was lucky enough to stay here. The house itself is adorable! A historic home that's been artfully renovated with warm, fun colors yet keeping true to the original charm, like the hardwood floors and doorknobs. The bathroom is brand new, immaculate, the tile floor is a stunning piece of art, plenty of extra towels and to, great water pressure, fast hot water, good lighting. The art! The queen bed was comfy and there is even a small kitchen-like area. Noise from outside wasn't noticable. I easily walked to and from campus from here. The wifi was plenty fast for streaming videos and video calls. So many small details were accounted for (3 different phone chargers provided, drinks in the fridge, a dedicated filtered water line! 5 star treatment!) And best of all, Krysia is a gem of a person - so conscientious and a top notch communicator. I can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and all of this for a steal of a price without a gounging high cleaning fee. Book this!!"

We love this spot — Krysia embodies the best of what hospitality can be & makes me think fondly about the good-ol’-days of Airbnb where it was about human connection & exploring new space. Krysia is welcoming, kind, respectful, and full of great recommendations!
Great price for a super cozy, private room & bathroom. Walkable to downtown Athens; I spent most of the day on foot. The kitchenette is so functional — we prepped food to bring and heat up to save some money by not eating out every meal. Make sure to visit the beautiful backyard & keep your eyes posted for Krysia’s art all around town.

Stayed one night","Krysia was a very friendly and accommodating host and this place could not have fitted my needs more perfectly. I was in town for a concert and just needed a place to crash for the night. Krysia’s cozy and colorful little place was the ideal and most comfortable way to get a good night’s sleep. I especially loved the decor of the bedroom, featuring funky and visually captivating works of art. It was also very close to downtown Athens, so if anyone is looking for a nice place to stay nearby, I would definitely recommend Krysia’s place."

Stayed one night","Really enjoyed my overnight stay in Krysia’s cute, funky space. I enjoyed the wild beauty of her peaceful garden, a nice peaceful urban space for enjoying nature. The bed was comfy. Fridge and microwave available. Bathroom impeccably clean. In close distance to the campus, coffee shops, delicious food, and bookstores. Krysia was very patient and helpful when I had questions, “Like how do I get this garden gate open?” Lol. Responds almost immediately. I would definitely stay at Krysia’s again."

There is even a little spigot of filtered water! The location is very close to downtown Athens, and the trip is walkable that’s your jam.
If you’re a longtime Air BnB fan, Krysia’s room will remind you of how things “used to be” - personal, thoughtful, and welcoming. I highly recommend it!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful stay at Krysia's! I arrived on a rainy evening, so it was so nice to walk into such a warm, inviting space of brilliant colors, beautiful art, and high ceilings.
Though the space is adjacent to the house, it's very private and it mostly felt like I was in a house by myself. I slept great! The space had everything I needed, from a desk to a space heater and perhaps the best tea selection I've ever had in an airbnb.
The location is ideal: Quiet and peaceful with trails nearby, yet a quick walk up the hill and there I was in the heart of historic downtown Athens.
Krysia's communication was superb both leading up to check-in and during my stay. We got to meet in person once and it was lovely chatting with her.
And her art garden is amazing! I'd love to stay at Krysia's again next time I'm in Athens."

A short distance Uber drive to the stadium (3-4 min). Krysia was also very nice. The room had an oscillating AC tower which worked since the nights were cooler. Krysia did cut the thermostat down in the main house during the day to help cool the room down. We would stay again. Thank you Krysia!

We were able to be entirely on foot, exploring trails and the amazing bike path, walking downtown for drinks at the best queer bar we've ever been to, followed by a great dinner and a punk show- special shout out to Sister Louisa's and the 40 Watt Club! 10/10 we'd definitely stay here again!"

The bathroom was clean and so cute (totally want to have a bathroom now with beautiful tiled floors). The mini kitchen has everything you need. It’s easy to get in. Very spacious. We felt comfortable - it was perfect. I will say it was almost 100 degrees outside and I was afraid the room would be hot, but the temp in the room was absolutely perfect. The fan is glorious and gives off lots of air. We will definitely try to stay here again, but I’m pretty sure it’s booked for a long time!"

Based on my brief time, this is a perfect Athens space for an Athens visit."

There is beautiful art hanging in the room, and I would argue that the tile in the bathroom is a work of art as well. The bed is comfortable, if a bit squeaky. We had everything we needed for a quick stay in Athens. Krysia is an excellent hostess, considerate and communicative, and has created a really beautiful space."

Cute room, clean, well thought out, an easy walk to a beautiful walking path along the river, quick access to the highway, good parking, beautiful garden and the mosaic pieces made by the owner were stunning. Communication was great. The room is as described separate or closed off from the house. Access using the electric lock was easy. I needed to work remotely, which went well. The kitchen items were exactly what I needed for the week. Little touches added to the experience, and you can tell she took the suggestions from previous guests. We interacted a few times during the week and thankfully got to meet the last day. Other than some intermittent noise from work they were doing on the house across the street (daytime), it was quiet and quaint. I didn't walk downtown, but it's definitely possible. Being that close was very convenient. It would be tight for 2 ppl IMO, but to just sleep- perfect."

Stayed one night","This was my first-ever booking on Airbnb. I came with my girlfriend for a quick post-Christmas getaway. So glad we found Krysia's place. She's an amazing artist whose artwork fills the room and an adjacent art garden and can be found in public spaces all over town.
We came during the Artic Blast of 2022 and worried if the heat in the room would be okay. There's central air/heat and a space heater, so we were plenty warm. Already planning on coming back in the spring when the garden is in bloom.
The noon checkout time was a huge plus. We slept in, walked across the park to Mamma's Boy for breakfast (a great Southern-style breakfast joint), and back along the river without worrying about rushing to leave."

Krysia was friendly, flexible, and very communicative. And her yard is GORGEOUS, so much beautiful art (as in pics in listing).
I totally recommend Krysia's place and will stay again next time I'm in Athens."

Beautiful landscaping and room to sit outside. Peaceful, quiet and safe feeling. The wifi was slow and made some of our remote work difficult. When we reached out to Lisa she was extremely responsive and willing to help stating the problem was internet challenges in Athens. Just be prepared you might need a plan B to go to UGA or somewhere near by if you need to Zoom. There was no W/D which ended up being ok in the end. Place was clean - a few cobwebs here and there - but the beds were comfy and linens super clean. Small kitchen if you need to do much cooking but the restaurants and grocer nearby are excellent."

The cottage is behind her house and you can't hear any road noise, which is nice. If you have kids, note two things: 1) you CAN fit a pack 'n play in the twin bed room, which I was very relieved to find out, and 2) this is listed, but a reminder that there is no tub and no laundry, which can be tough with kids. The cabin was thoughtfully decorated and clean, and the bed is very comfy!"

Stayed a few nights","This cottage is absolutely dreamy - like out of a Nicholas Sparks novel. The decor is exquisite. The location is walking distance to everything you would want/need in Athens/UGA. We were in town for a college visit and I was really hoping that my daughter would not LOVE it (bc it is too far away). Upon arrival, only minutes after getting our bags in the cottage, 6 deer (3 babies) were right outside the back patio. I mean, if the cottage alone wasn't impressive enough, the landscaping/atmosphere/environment/nature was sure to delight. This place was putting on a show!!! And we were loving it. Athens is sooooo charming. Five Points is a very unique area with tons to do and see. Downtown Athens had some of the cutest boutiques EVER. And talk about southern hospitality. This area exudes it. Everyone is so polite and friendly. I cannot, in any way, describe how nice this cottage and area are. If you are thinking about visiting Athens or UGA, do it. You will not regret it. We enjoyed every second of our visit. Lisa is perfection, as well as her cottage. Her design taste is impeccable. BOOK THIS COTTAGE!"

We even got our dog fix because the property included a beautiful and friendly golden retriever who allowed us to ooh and ahhh over him during his morning outings.

Stayed a few nights","This is a very quiet setting because it's set back from a very busy street in Athens, GA. It's quiet except for when the yard service shows up early in the morning with their leaf blowers wide open! What a way to wake up! Wish we had been warned that they were going to show up. Needless to say, it was extremely loud!"

Stayed over a week","The cottage was in a quiet setting, but just off a main road and within walking distance of stores and restaurants at Five Points. The university was within a 5 minute drive. It was very cozy, and the beds were super-comfortable! Lisa responded promptly to questions, despite being out of town at one point, and made sure we were well taken care of. She's a terrific host, and we had a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Perfect location. Few minute walk to great restaurants, health food grocery store and yoga studio. If your ambitious and like to walk you can also walk for about 1.5 miles to the main downtown street in Athens as well.
Plenty of hot water.
Comfortable beds and plenty of towels and linens.
Cozy yet roomy space that is nestled in the company of trees off the main road.
Quiet.
Easy check in.
Comfortable sofa and living area.
Can only say good things about every aspect of our stay here!
Oh and if you’re a coffee lover, there’s the best little bakery a short walk away called Independent Bakery. Has one of the best lattes ever!
Thank you Lisa!"

Stayed about a week","The cottage is a convenient, stylish, and somewhat secluded getaway for trips to Athens and the University of Georgia. It’s situated in the upscale (and very safe) Five Points area of Athens, with many restaurants, shops, and grocery within a nice walking distance. (The Five Points area is such a happening place that parking can sometimes be tricky, so it was nice to be able to have a quick stroll to dinner and such). Although located just off of one of the main hubs in Athens, the cottage is located behind a gorgeous home/shop, surrounded with lush greenery, and feels very private. The inside feels spacious yet cozy for 1-3 people. We also found it easy to navigate around Athens using the cottage location as a starting point. We had an extended stay, and very much enjoyed our trip and stay in the Cottage."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa's place was wonderful for visiting our daughter at UGA. The cottage is adorable and especially close to the sorority houses, which was great for us. Lisa had lost of coffee and shower amenities available for us. You should be aware that although there are two bedrooms, the entrance to the second bedroom is through the main bedroom which is only an issue if your child stays out later than you do, LOL!"
