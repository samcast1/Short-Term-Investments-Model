Stayed a few nights","We stayed at this cabin for a long family weekend of hiking and relaxing. This cabin was perfect for our stay. It was immaculate upon our arrival and offered plenty of space for 3 adults. We were able to start our day with breakfast that we cooked in the fully appointed kitchen, and it was a short drive to everywhere we wanted to hike or explore. The restaurants that we walked to down the street were excellent, and the locals were very friendly. The front porch was great for resting after a long day, and the neighborhood was very quiet so we got a restful night's sleep. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!"

Only perhaps helpful tip for customers is that walls are thin and floors are squeaky so maybe not ideal for multiple guests of light sleepers but the surroundings were quiet and peaceful and our stay overall was very enjoyable and we would definitely come again!

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I had a wonderful time staying here to explore and experience everything the Cumberland Gap had to offer. All hiking trails and restaurants were easily accessible by walking. The only time we drove all weekend was to the Pinnacle Overlook. The cabin was spacious, clean, and in really great shape. It seems like it was newly renovated and the antique furniture is charming, quaint, and in really good condition. We enjoyed the spacious front porch and fresh air. The hostess is very kind and friendly and gave clear instructions to make check-in extremely easy. Would definitely stay here again! I can’t say enough good things about it."

Stayed a few nights","I loved this place so much that I booked our second stay here after just our first night. The cottage was spotless and comfortable. It is located on a quiet street and close to restaurants, few antique shops and the popular iron furnace hike (where 3 states meet at the top) in Cumberland Gap. The perfect place for us to stay while moving our Lincoln Memorial University student into her apartment in Middlesboro. I also loved starting the day with a cup of coffee on the front porch and ending the day there with a glass of wine. Can’t wait to come back soon!"

Stayed one night",The Pumpkin Patch is an adorable little guest house that is well kept and clean. We weren’t there very long but the personal touches were much appreciated! It is equipped with everything you need and very homey. My only complaint is that we did not arrive until quite late and it was nearly impossible to find in the dark. There is a motion sensor light on the house but it doesn’t go on until you are pretty close. It took us 3 times around the block and a call with the host to actually find it. Then we had to shine our headlights on the lockbox to adjust the code and get to the keys. It was intimidating driving into the neighborhood at night. People walking around randomly and dogs barking behind chain link fences. I don’t think it would have been alarming had we checked in during the day but not knowing our surroundings late at night with very few lights around was unnerving.

Stayed with a pet","We loved the cabin. Sitting on the porch was so relaxing. The cabin was just as described. I do have to rave about how proactive Richie was. During our last night there, some terrible storms came through and we lost power. Richie was monitoring it on his own and reported the outage to the power company in the middle of the night and sent a message letting us know he had done so. Unfortunately, we did not get power back and packed up to leave without lights. We left a couple of items which Richie found and is shipping back to us. While Richie respected our privacy, he was still an attentive host!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved our long weekend at Richie’s cabin. It is an incredibly special place. Isolated and peaceful but close enough to local restaurants, Kroger, and the Cumberland gap Park, which is where we spent the bulk of our time when we weren’t at the cabin.
We loved walking along the river with our dog, making fires in the wood burning fire place, and just chilling out at the cabin. The cabin is really cool / interesting in and of itself. The bed is extremely comfortable. And the huge front porch is amazing for sitting outside and reading and just listening to the river and the birds.
Richie was very communicative / helpful. I hope we get a chance to return. This was a hidden pocket of paradise. Highly recommend to recharge your batteries. I still feel blissed out after being back at work for one day!"

Stayed a few nights","Richie’s place is awesome. We were looking for quality time, fishing time for my husband and son, and we got so much more. The cabin is amazing, the area is breathtaking. Richie is the ultimate host. He did more than was required at all times, from helping us to figure out Apple TV, to being super flexible with our fishing plans, and the weather. We will definitely be back as soon as we can break away. The fishing spot was perfect, Richie’s knowledge was unsurpassed and the gear was great. The fire pit was tops for my guys, Richie started the fire, it kept them cozy and warm, they loved it. Richie is a great example of a Tennessee sportsman, we enjoyed him very much.
. He’s a good, honest man. The memorabilia was also top notch. Every time we turned around we were impressed, it was painstakingly decorated."

Stayed with a pet","Remote but not inconvenient to shopping. We ate in but there were restaurants nearby. Secluded, no neighbors. At night, in winter with no leaves on trees, no lights visible other than our own. Silence. Occasional vehicle could be heard passing on the road below.
The cabin interior is very rustic yet comfortable. Beds were big and comfy. If you like cozy you’re going to want to make use of the fireplace. We took fire logs for easy fire staring. It’s a real fireplace not a prefab insert. It’s a real log cabin not a kit.
We were there the week after Christmas. Richie had a Christmas tree up and lit. This was a nice touch to the homey decor.
Kitchen included fridge with ice maker, coffee maker, microwave, toaster oven, no dishwasher-no problem. Nice size table could seat 8, chairs for 6. 4 of us used one half for eating the other half for games.
Gas stove/oven.
Den has nice big flatscreen tv, with Apple TV, mounted above fireplace. We took in a movie while enjoying a fire."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great rustic cabin! If you’re looking for a vacation home to stay in versus a cabin this is not your place. Yes it’s a little rough around the edges but the description calls it a little short. It’s larger than expected, well equipped, just not fancy.
River is down the hill and accross the road, but we were there because Valor Ridge being only 20 minutes away! Perfect spot us 3 dudes to hang out in the woods be bothered by nobody. Grill some steaks, maybe a beverage or two and recharge.
Driveway is a bit steep and rocky, no issues for us but if you were going to stop here on a motorcycle you’d probably make it, but hang on tight."

Stayed with a pet","This quirky little cabin in the woods is a little piece of heaven. It’s definitely rustic, but very cozy and comfy. Richie provided everything we could possibly need. We stayed a week, and loved it.
Don’t let previous comments about the driveway scare you, we had no problem driving up the hill. We’re a group of seniors in our seventies, and found no problems getting around the cabin. The porch is a spectacular bonus. It has lots of seating and is perfect for catching a cool breeze, and hanging out to read, play games, eat and just enjoy nature.
The beautiful, lazy little Powell River is at the bottom of the hill. If you don’t want to walk town, you can load everything in your car and park at the bottom, where you’ll find a beautifully maintained private park area, for all sorts of family activities including swimming, fishing, etc.
It’s obvious that Richie takes a lot of pride in keeping his guests happy. Richie is the best host we’ve ever encountered in our many travels."

We had a couple things we wanted to do in the area but we wanted a place that gave us space to relax. The cabin was plenty spacious. The porch was awesome for morning/ afternoon coffee. The firepit, cornhole and river to swim in was amazing. Ive read many comments about the driveway. It is on a strong grade but we have an Hyundai minivan and did just fine. Richie was super responsive and very helpful. Cannot thank him enough. The pictures are spot on for what you get. If you’re looking for a place to go unwind this is a great spot to do it."

The cabin brings an authentic mountain experience and is very secluded. 'COZY' is the best way to describe it. The river access is right down the drive way and across the small road. This is an amazing spot to kayak and Richie will help you out with that if need be. Follow Richie's directions and you'll get there just fine! It's almost part of the charm just finding the place. This will definitely be our go-to spot for future trips to the Gap. Great experience overall!

Stayed a few nights","Rustic cabin about 2.5 miles off of the main road through Harrogate. Rowell river road is a paved winding narrow road, maybe only 1 and a 1/2 cars wide at spots. Some blind almost hairpin curves in spots. Almost had a head on collision with someone who was FLYING up the road towards us. They had to lock up their breaks and skid. They almost lost control of their truck. The driveway is steep and very bumpy. A senior citizen or novice driver should not attempt to rent this cabin.
The cabin itself was great. What you would expect in a con in the woods. All amenities were great and modern. Coffee, creamers and filters provided.
No chore list at check out. He said he takes care of everything. WE didn't have time to explore the area by the river, but I would think you need to park down there and then drive up to the cabin. It would be very difficult to walk up toe the cabin and back down.
We rented tubes from Shelly Belles on the next road over and did the 2 hour tube float. Fun"

Comfy rocking chairs on the porch, and one in the loft as well, invite you to sit and relax - which was easy to do here! The porch swing was a favorite hangout at night as well.
Our preteen grandkids loved the loft bedrooms and the huge choice of games and books.
We arrived in pouring rain, and loved being able to enjoy our dinner and our evening , dry and comfy on the porch.
Our one and only disappointment was that we didn’t book more than one night.
So thankful for this relaxing stop during our travels! Would love to return for a longer stay.

The imperfections of the cabin, finished in a simple country living style, are what create it's charm and appeal. There is kayaking, tubing, fishing, and hiking nearby. Richie, the awesome host, will arrange the river activities for you, supply equipment, and take you to the launch. Richie is the nicest, most helpful, host we have ever experienced in our journeys. Word of advice...you must visit the town of Cumberland Gap, especially Nineteen19 restaurant and the Juice Spot. This was a memorable trip! Thanks, Richie!!"

Stayed over a week","Located literally amidst the treetops above Powell River, The Rustic Cabin offers a peaceful respite from the outside world. Larger than most cabins w/similar amenities; comfy king bed; huge porch to enjoy the cool mountain air. Offers fishing & kayaking, which we didn’t avail ourselves of, but hiked each day in nearby Cumberland State Park & Pine Mountain. Great trails and views!
Few noteworthy things: Be very cautious on 3mi road to cabin after you exit from US25E onto Powell River Road. Very narrow & has numerous blind curves. Also the short entrance road to the driveway itself is very steep (use low gear), rutted out & rocky; the shower in master bath is currently out of order but second bath shower/tub is functioning. New washer Ritchie installed while we were there works great. He’s a caring, considerate and accommodating host who really enjoys making great memories for his guests."

Pluses for our us were: Redbuds in blossom right off the big porch, fireplace in cozy living room, well stocked kitchen, closeness to Cumberland Gap Park and beautiful Tennessee outdoors.
Big minuses: Master bathroom shower was duct taped closed with ""out of order"" marked on it, toilet leaked when flushed with stains showing this wasn't something new. In second bathroom, the tub drained so slowly two people couldn't take baths the same night. (Bathtub did have a shower head.)
Super Host Richie responded with surprise and eagerness to come resolve our complaints, but we couldn't imagine any quick fixes. So we left a day early."

Stayed with a pet","I've stayed at a ton of Air B&B's and Richie is a top tier host. A few thing happened (on me as the guest) that could have derailed our trip. The way he handled it as a host was better than I've experienced. His response time is also very fast.
For being a cabin in the woods, it's very clean. It's well stocked and the porch and bed are fantastic. Just book it already."

Richie is a wonderful host and very responsive when we needed to ask questions.

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is in such a beautiful area, kayaking, fishing. Lazy day floating down the river or just a quick swim there on the property. The cabin itself is much larger than it appears with a tree being the focal point inside the house. Open beams shooting across the ceiling and a beautiful loft that sleeps at least four possibly more with the additional blow up mattresses. Downstairs is a king size bedroom and bed to match. Two full size bathrooms and a wonderful and cozy fireplace with wood burning fire. Lovely big sofa and it’s decorated with old fashion charm! Wrap around porch and furniture to lazy with a cup or coffee and relaxing into memories of your vacation days or even a business trip. A reasonable value. All and all we will be visiting again. They provided every comfort, even game tables and darts for adults to checkers for the kids. With a 10 minute drive to every conceivable attraction it is a must stay value!!!!"

Stayed with a pet","The pictures and description show a rustic cabin in the woods with the illusion that it’s on the river. This is a unfinished cabin in some desperate need for repair and deep cleaning. The floors and kitchen were clean, but there was a LOT of dust on everything. The listing says there are 2 bathrooms and shows a shower in both bathrooms, however, it’s obvious that’s one hasn’t worked in a very long time. This cabin is a one bedroom with a loft that has beds. There are exposed wires upstairs. The grill was nasty and unusable. On top of everything, the river isn’t visible from the road. It’s on the property, but you have to cross a road and sit under a metal garage in plastic chairs to see the river.
The property owner will not respond back about my disappointment. He took my money and could care less about his guests comfort."

Stayed a few nights","Richie was a great host, very responsive to our questions. Next time we are in this area we plan to stay here again. We visited in July, and the weather was wonderful, especially compared to back home in AL!
The cabin is as rustic as it appears in the ad yet was very comfortable. Being well off the main road, it was private and very quiet in the area. Road traffic was minimal on the river road.
Interestingly decorated with lots of memorabilia, the house is full of character and things to see. I kept thinking it reminded me of Cracker Barrell! The living room is very comfortable. Upstairs, there were lots of games in case you need something to do on a rainy day. A large screen smart TV completes the room and includes a game set.
The deck is overly expansive relative to the furnishings, and it was very nice to sit out there, especially in the evening. There is a nice view toward the mountains across the river, but no actual river view from the unit. There was a nice breeze and lots of birds singing all day long. We spent a lot of time out there, chatting with our friends.
It is a bit of a hike downhill to the river, but the area is very well kept and a great place to hang out. There is a fire pit you can grill on if you want. Access to water is easy, and the river was very beautiful.
The kitchen was pretty well equipped and served our needs just fine, as we usually cook about half our dinners and all of breakfast meals when we stay in a cabin.
Bathrooms had lots of countertop space for our things and there was ample lighting and storage. Water pressure was a bit too high. I would say the shower was piercing! But much better than not enough pressure, which is often an issue at a remote cabin.
Lots to see in the area, and the local restaurants are very good. I highly recommend this place it you are seeking river adventure or interested the history of the area."

The porch is beautiful. Kitchen is well stocked. The riverfront portion of Richie’s property is gorgeous. Location was great for us, too. We visited Cumberland Gap. White water rafted in Hartford, TN. Drove out to Cumberland Falls State Park and McCreary County, KY. A bit of a drive, but worth it. Rented kayaks from Richie, which was so fun! We had a great week! My family highly recommends Richie’s cabin."

Stayed about a week","This rustic cabin was exactly as advertised: a rustic cabin in the woods. It is comfy, roomy, and has a lot of character. I loved the beautiful stained glass window over the main door, and how it glowed as the sun came up.
My family (me and my husband, and my parents and their dog) used it as a base for hiking in the nearby Cumberland Gap National Park, and it was perfect. It was a short drive to the park, grocery store and restaurants, yet we felt like we were really in a peaceful, back-to-nature setting.
The gas stove in the kitchen was nice, and there was a lot of storage for groceries, in addition to a nicely stocked pantry that contained many cooking ingredients, like spices, oils and vinegars. We did a lot of our cooking at the cabin, making use of the grill and crockpot. There were knives, cutting boards, a variety of pots and pans, and a nice selection of cooking utensils.
The beds were very comfortable, with nice bedding, and the towels were nice, too.
The deck was where we spent much of our time--the view was lovely, and we saw many cardinals and even a couple of bald eagles.
There was a great selection of games and books for the couple of rainy days we experienced, which was nice, and the dining room table is big enough for both family meals and games or puzzles.
Richie was quick to respond to any questions we had, and his instructions for checking in, etc. were very clear.
If you are looking for a Holiday Inn type of experience, this is probably not the best choice, but if you are looking for solace in the woods, then I would highly recommend."

Group trip","Unique ambience in a beautiful, secluded location in the middle of the Tennessee mountains. The smell of cedar upon entering only adds to the already rustic vibe of the cabin, and it is outfitted with almost anything you think you could need while you are away from home. If it’s not—the owner is just a text message away, and is very responsive to his guests. They also offer experiences for a marginal fee, such as kayaking, fishing, mountain biking, etc. We didn’t use these services while we were there, as we had a really full schedule, but there are nature experiences to be had for the taking. Like the rest of the house, the bed I slept in was extremely comfortable, and there is even a laundry room there to use for extended stays or if your clothes get wet or dirty. Overall, an excellent experience in a sublime location, and a place that I plan to return to in the future!"

The cabin is remote and truly rustic, think “glorified glamping.” It is clean, well stocked for cooking and a great spot for a laid back family vacation. It’s loaded with games and good books. We used the large gas grill for most meals. We loved the outdoor dart game set up. Access to the river is a short walk (hilly) or drive from the cabin. The cabin is in the woods without a view of the river in the summer. We had a blast but it is important to realize that this is a unique property. It would not be accessible for people with mobility problems. The private bedroom with a king is downstairs. All other beds are upstairs without an upstairs bath (2 baths downstairs). It’s a great place for the right group. The Powell river is clean and beautiful for fishing, swimming, kayaking or tubing. Great trip!"

Group trip","Richie's home was insanely beautiful and my family had the most AMAZING time there. It was SO clean and felt just like home! The river is absolutely perfect and there were not nearly as many mosquitos as we expected, which was a lovely surprise. Six of us went kayaking and the scenery was incredible, we highly recommend it even though there were some shallow spots that made it a bit hard to get past. We hope to be able to return again soon and try some more of the awesome activities offered! Thank you so, so, so much!"

Stayed a few nights","The stay was just what we needed! Richie was so easy-going and answered my many questions. . Because the weather turned cold, we enjoyed our stay without kayaking/floating, but we did not miss it. We relaxed on the porch and by the river and listened to the birds. We enjoyed watching FSU beat LSU at the super-regional tournament on ESPN Friday night. And, although Heavy's BBQ was not open as a restaurant, I was able to drive there and order/pay for ribs in advance and picked them up for our Saturday afternoon meal. We are looking forward to another stay soon. Wonderful place!!"

The mattresses were very nice and bedrooms were very big. Ashley goes above and beyond for her guests and it really showed.

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed at of a lot of Airbnb homes and this one jumped to the top of our list. The house is wonderfully spacious, immaculately clean, tucked away so that it feels private even though there are neighbors in the general area. The wonderful little touches in this house like Packets of tea and coffee, a basket with granola bars and other treats, terrific pots and pans that we didn’t have an opportunity to use this time, but we certainly will on our next visit! There’s not a single thing in this home that feels like it was placed there without thought.
The huge living room with multiple tables, chairs, sofas, and a huge smart tv made for a perfect place to hang out. The deck area was wonderful. Very impressed with all of the personal touches, the nice flatware and appliances that show a lot of thought was put into this home (I’ve stayed in places where it was pretty clear that the pots and pans, flatware and dishes were picked out at the lowest cost in case things got broken or stolen which is understandable, but also made this kitchen particularly refreshing). Although we didn’t use it for this visit, there is a gorgeous bar set up that would be terrific for entertaining friends and family. The beds were big and extremely comfortable.
When I had a question about something, Ashley responded immediately and was extremely friendly. I can’t recommend this house highly enough! Absolutely terrific find."

Stayed one night","My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Ciaras place in Cumberland Gap. The location is central to Gap Creek Coffee House, 19 nineteen Grill and Angelo’s. It’s within walking distance of great walking trails and a short drive to Cumberland Gap National Park and Wilderness Road State Park. The apartment was very clean and up to date. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Janice and Shelby were great to work with. They were quick to respond when I had questions! Place was in a quiet and small hilly neighborhood! Nice park to walk with a playground was about 1.5 miles away. Cumberland park was 10 minutes at most! SO beautiful with endless trails.
Place was above a garage, but don't let that fool you...it was SO nice! Clean and well stocked with linens and kitchenware. Had LOTS of towels, washcloths, soap and other goodies! A/C, lights, and ceiling fans worked great!
Plenty of supplies to clean with...even had dishwashing and clothing detergent. I bought some salt and pepper, so FYI you may want to grab some when you stay. I did leave the salt. Shopped at a local IGA grocery store that had all that I needed and kept me from having to drive to the next town. Give it a shot. Had a few places to eat nearby...mostly local and a Subway.
I would DEFINITELY recommend and stay here again. Thank you Janice and Shelby!"

This property stands alone and it is on top of a big garage building. So if you have problems with stairs, this might not be for you. However, is you don't mind stairs, then this is perfect! Super quiet, beautiful surroundings, super clean and comfortable. We didn't use the sofa bed, but the mattress in the bedroom us brand new and awesome. I also loved having the washer and dryer in the bathroom. Very European approach. Whenever we come back to the area this will be the first place we will check for availability."

All the amenities you could need are here along with history, and warmth for your soul. We will definitely come back. We did have a pipe break, but the owners took care of it right away and for the inconvenience we were able to stay another day at no extra charge.￼ love the privacy and having a Host a phone call away.

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay so much. The home was very clean and had everything we needed. We made meals and they had every pot, utensil, and dish we could want. The house was on a beautiful piece of property that we wish we had more time to enjoy. The photographs of the listing are accurate. It's in a rural area so is a little difficult to find after dark, so I'd recommend a daylight arrival if you can swing it. It is an older house so expect the little oddities that go along with this kind of property. The wood floors are a little slanted in places and maybe the main bathroom is a little tight, but if you like charming older homes, you will enjoy this. There was plenty of room to spread out in the evening. We could read in one room while the kids watched a movie in the other. Huge dining room table for games and meals. The A/C worked well and we had plenty of hot water for 4 showers each morning. The hosts were very helpful and we look forward to staying again."

Many updates needed from linens to appliances. The cottage itself has a lot of charm because it is an older house. The furnishings are nice and comfortable. Cleanliness is not what I would expect. It is not filthy by any means, but could use a good “spring cleaning”. It feels like just enough cleaning is done to get by. This is just our experience. Maybe it is usually better than what we experienced. Overall, the cottage was okay and was adequate for the few nights we spent there."

Nicole was very prompt with communicating and is VERY accommodating.
It’s too bad that we didn’t stay here until it was our last visit!

Stayed with kids","The house was cute, and the creek/dam outside was nice. That said, I will not stay here again next time I'm in the area.
The house has structural issues and is very crooked. As a result, the floors are very uneven and some of the doors do not close. The kitchen has low drop ceilings, and an odd countertop arrangement that makes it awkward to squeeze through to the bedroom off the kitchen. There is a water pipe going through a closet, grout popping out of floor tiles because of the uneven floors, lots of things like that.
The decor is bright and cute, and for some people the structure issues probably aren't a big deal for a trip. The house was well equipped with everything you would need.
I think this property depends on the kind of person you are. If you're not going to sweat the details and just want a cute place to hang out, go for it! If you're in construction like me, the details will probably drive you crazy, though!"

We originally were trying to get closer to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge but so glad we stayed away from the chaos. We truly enjoyed the Cumberland Gap and the beautiful scenery. It was absolutely refreshing and just what we needed. The cottage was clean, unique, comfortable, and enjoyable. We would recommend your property to anyone for a great week of R & R!"

Stayed one night","This cottage was adorable and cozy! The only issue I had was finding the place, but that is of no fault of the owners. My GPS told me I arrived when I was in the middle of the road haha. I was able to turn around and find it. It was easy to see from the road in the daylight. It is so private so the house was silent. Paired with the comfortable beds, it was the best sleep I've had in a long time. We used the fire pit to make smores and the sound of the creek is so relaxing and the fairy lights were a beautiful touch. Unfortunately it started raining so we went inside and used the beautiful sun room to watch the rain from the inside. The house is very well decorated and so cute. I would love to come back to this house again in the future!"

Cozy cottage with all the kitchen amenities-great decor, board games & books. Tons of space to hang out or have a quiet moment to yourself in the sunroom. So much more to explore outdoors on the farm. Great morning walks, coffee overlooking the falls, bonfires with s’mores in the evening. We didn’t want to leave! Thank you Nichole and Ciara for your responsiveness and hospitality. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed with a pet","My fiancé & I traveled from CA over the course of 4 days to move to our new home of Tennessee, & to say the least Amy was absolutely wonderful. She was so accommodating & very sweet, ensuring us that we had a safe spot to lay our heads. We had booked for 3 months while we got on our feet after moving across the country. Amy went above & beyond to make sure we had a great stay, communication was great & she responded very promptly. She even has recommendations for places to eat on the fridge & small thank you notes from past guests. The house had every little thing we could possibly need, small every day things like tape, pens, a small sewing kit, kitchen needs as well as cleaning supplies & laundry detergent. Amy is the sweetest, most down to earth person, & the neighbors are just as friendly. Always waving and saying hello when i would walk our dogs. Beautiful quiet area & amazing community. Amy has made our move so safe, easy and relaxing that we cant thank her enough."

There did not appear to be a grill on the premises, so next time we will bring a small one. The only suggestion I would make would be that the potentially beautiful views out of the windows are a bit obstructed. There is a hutch in the kitchen blocking one window and a large tree/bush blocking the view from another. The setting is gorgeous, needs to be opened up a bit IMO. Otherwise, zero complaints and would absolutely stay there again."

Stayed with a pet","Place was perfectly fine and fun to be at. We were there for a ceremony at the university 10 miles down the road. We bright two dogs and crated them when we were gone. The actual stay was great.
When we got home we got a message with a request to pay a $100 fee for a circular half inch hole in the floor. We did not cause this hole. The host messaged us and inquired about it but progressively became more short and rude to us when we explained we did not do the damage. After having to speak with Air B&B support and trying to be nice to the host over messages I received a message from the host stating she figured out how it happened and said she was sorry without explanation.
All this to say it was a peaceful place but the way we were accused and treated was out of place and uncalled for. Hopefully we are the only visitors that have this experience. Sadly we won’t come back again due to the way we were talked to."

Stayed a few nights","We live a short distance 1.5-2 hours away and live in the mountains with complete privacy. Our review may not match previous reviews but I can see how views, quietness and privacy are all positives for the majority of renters.
What we enjoyed mostly was that the “owner” who lives next door always responded quickly to any questions we had prior to renting and also pre arrival. We also didn’t see her the entire time during our stay although I’m sure she would’ve made herself available if we had any needs. So, the place was a “home away from home” and didn’t present as a place where you felt as the owner was always watching.
In short, we had zero complaints and would recommend to anyone for a quaint place to stay. It was also nice having the border collie visit each time we came in. 😃"

Honestly she went above and beyond any expectations we could have had. My husband and I were in a car accident while there. It totaled our vehicle. Amy jumped right in to help us as much as possible. So I'm just going to say - we arrived as strangers but left as friends. She truly renewed our faith in the generosity of others. Not just Amy but her family too. Best place ever to stay. Can't wait till I'm well enough to go back.

Stayed with kids","First off I’d like to start by saying, this place is so cute. However it’s tiny. Pictures are very deceiving. Definitely not great for people with a kid. The bed is comfortable, but makes tons of noise when you move. There’s not much noise from neighbors or anything else, which is wonderful. The bathroom is very large. But the rest of the house is small. There isn’t a view from the porch. There is big trees covering the view. However if you want to be secluded and be left alone it’s perfect. The kitchen is well stocked with pans, plates, bowls, and utensils. Bring your own Tupperware tho. There was a Keurig but only one actual coffee kcup. After reading other peoples reviews I felt like we weren’t giving the same treatment. The breakfast part of the b&b was instant oatmeal packets. When others mentioned they got goodie baskets. Which I honestly didn’t expect but instant oatmeal was a tad lazy to me. Lots of reading material and information about Tennessee. The couch is also tiny and honestly was the worst part. We wanted to have a lazy day and we just couldn’t get comfortable on the couch. If you are a couple or single person that just wants to sit on the porch and read this is perfect for you."

The kitchen had all the items we needed for the stay, and the hosts provided some food items (including eggs and snacks) along with coffee. Inside the cottage, you will find an assortment of items. (If you forgot something, look in the cottage before going to one of the stores a couple of miles away). The wife appreciated the fresh flowers in the cottage.
The cottage itself is about 450 square feet with the main room encompassing the kitchen, dining, and living areas being about 13' x 20'. The bedroom has a very comfortable queen sized bed and a closet with ample storage space. The lavatory was large and had good quality towels along with toiletries.
We saw the owner's dog in the yard one time and it acted very friendly. Situated on a dead in in a rural area, this cottage was very quiet and relaxing."

Stayed a few nights","Amy’s guest house is fabulous ! Spent two nights here while visiting and hiking in Cumberland Gap. The house is cozy — perfect for one or two people. Immaculate and comfortable inside and a wonderful covered veranda with a porch swing and a small table for relaxing or dining outside. This was a perfect spot to read after my long, wet hike and enjoy the apres-hike rain and pleasant temps while staying dry. Quiet and peaceful at night. Had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with Amy —- a delightful and attentive hostess. It’s clear she takes great pride in her guest house !
One of my very favorite Airbnbs of the countless I’ve stayed at over the years. Highly, highly recommended!!!"

The only downfall was that in the Airbnb listing, it says there are 4 beds. 2 queen sizes and 2 singles. When we looked around we found one queen size bed in the bedroom and then a cot in the living room. Besides that, I would stay here again and would recommend it to anyone."

The cottage was better than the pictures; super clean, spacious, comfortable and updated. The grounds are beautiful, the patio a pleasure to sit on and take in the hilly views, the location secluded and super quiet. The goodies she leaves for guests ( bottled water, fruits, veggies, snacks, breakfast items, tea, coffee and condiments) really add that special touch to the stay. The communication with Amy upon a very late arrival for us was very good, she was very accommodating and helpful. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first ever Airbnb rental so we were a tad hesitant as well as anxious as we finally made the commitment. We needed a beautiful, relaxing and comfortable setting to change our pace, flip our scenery and recharge us after an “interesting” year… and… we were looking for something within an hour and a half of our home for about four nights in case our new grand baby arrived early.
Amy’s offering seemed WAY to good to be true at such a reasonable price. A small, clean, beautiful cottage… perfect for a couple on a beautiful piece of property centered in one of the most gorgeous spots in the Eastern US, where three states meet… the Cumberland Gap.
Amy’s place is better in every way than what we had envisioned. She takes so many “extra” steps that are not necessary and would not be missed if not done, but because she does it… It makes the overall experience so much better, enjoyable and special. It was weird but from the moment we arrived we felt like we were at home in a very safe haven.
Every day we started before sunrise and went late into the night exploring and taking in so many things that the area has to offer. Hiking, kayaking, scenic drives, great food, amazing sunrises, sky-on-fire sunsets and elevated Mountain Vista‘s and pinnacles that will take your breath away!
Amy is awesome! The cottage is awesome! The setting is awesome! The surrounding area to explore is awesome! I guess what I’m saying is… We had an awesome time… and… We will absolutely head back to our “second home“ in the future.

Waking up in the mornings to a beautiful view right outside our door was so refreshing. I couldn't have asked for anything better than staying at Amy's guest house and receiving such great hospitality. She has the friendliest dog that would stop by and greet us in the mornings which simply added a touch more of tender loving care . It was hard to leave, but my boyfriend and I will definitely be booking another stay come 2021."

The place is surrounded by mountains and located next door to Amy. There are strategic trees in between her house and the next door neighbor, so the place is perfectly private.

The interior is spotless, comfortable, beautifully decorated and has everything you need for your home away home.

Also brought our dog; she loved looking out the windows of the turret. Very spacious for two adults and our dog. I guess there was a graduation this weekend, so Friday night the bar downstairs didn’t quiet down until almost 2am. Saturday night was not as loud and settled down around midnight.

Stayed one night","I cannot say enough good things about this experience. Cumberland Gap is a beautiful spot, and this Air B&B is the best of the best. The space is so wonderful- big and airy, historic, character in every corner. And a great bar/restaurant below (also Kevin‘s), so we could take drinks up to our room - it was all laid back and wonderful. Super clean, attention to detail everywhere - I would give this 11 starts is I could. Can’t wait to go back."

Even during a busy festival in town, Kevin was great to talk to during check-in and made it quick and easy to understand. The pool table and bar area made for the perfect area to hang out with friends. The private deck is cozy, but it does get dark out there at night. But that doesn’t take away from it as there’s plenty of room inside to enjoy things. Will absolutely stay again!"

The downside is it is above a bar, which I was aware of, but just be prepared to hear loud music and conversations until midnight or whenever it closes. My biggest complaint was the shower didn’t seem like it was cleaned well and old coffee was left in the Keurig. Also, an open pack of cigarettes in a kitchen drawer.. random."

Great views from the room and and awesome patio to relax on. Only thing I would recommend being aware of is that there is a bar below that is open later and we could somewhat hear the music until they were closed. nothing crazy or super rowdy, but if you are a light sleeper you will want to be cognizant of that."

This historic property is delightful with brick walls, old hearths, exquisite moldings and beautiful pocket doors. We felt the furnishings complimented the historic character without diminishing the comfort one is looking for in a get away vacation spot. That theme carried through the bath and kitchen areas. Was great to be able to order dinner from the restaurant below. Cumberland Gap is such a quaint area and the Inn is the perfect central place to reach shops, coffee cafes, hiking trails and other attractions of the area. Our host - Kevin was very attentive and quick to communicate. Thank you for such a restful, restorative trip."

Stayed a few nights","I haven't done a lot of Airbnb so I didn't know what to expect from a small town experience. All I can say that if this is the normal experience, sign me up for more! The place was amazing. I checked in on a Saturday night. Little did I know, I share a ceiling/floor with the best bar in town below me. Got to meet many of the locals and some of the college students going to LMU for med school. Great people! I needed to get some work done when I was there. Since the place is huge and the internet access was stellar, I was productive during the day. Late afternoon, I would hit the hiking trails- the trailheads are only a couple blocks away. The history of the area and views were stellar. I ate out while I was there. Angelos is the best restaurant in town. Glad that I shared a wall with them as well. The place was built in 1890 and I felt like a true world traveler when I opened the door. The furnishings in the place were perfect...and this has to be the only Airbnb with a bar, private deck, and a pool table! If you are going to Cumberland Gap, TN STAY THERE. If your plans don't include Cumberland Gap, make them. This is a spectacular experience you don't want to miss."

Stayed a few nights","Great location above bar/restaurant in quiet Cumberland Gap. Served as perfect place to sleep when taking daughter back to Lincoln Memorial University. It is above a bar, so if you're looking for complete silence, you will need to look elsewhere, but noise was not too bad. Nice to be able to walk downstairs and get a drink or food at reasonable price."

The only note I'd like to leave for future guests is that it is located directly above the bar, so it is pretty noisy. If you have a family like myself this could be tricky, but if you are on a weekend away with your spouse or taking a trip with your friends then this is the perfect place for you! Kevin was incredibly responsive and professional and the restaurant located below the bar was delicious."

I can say without reservation that this location, this place, and this host are top notch. I’ve stayed here a few times now and will never stay anywhere else when visiting the Gap. This is a fun, very relaxed space with so much history around it! Kevin is such an attentive and communicative host - always available if something is needed. Beautiful views. Fantastic music, food, atmosphere downstairs. Perfect."

Stayed over a week","Once again, I am left wishing I didn’t have to leave! I stayed for 2 weeks.From start to end, this stay was wonderful! I often have a hard time sleeping, but the bed was so comfortable that I was beyond surprised to sleep soundly! Best pillows I’ve ever slept on. The Christmas tree was a beautiful, thoughtful touch that I appreciated very much. Whenever I needed something or had a question, the hosts were quick to respond and help with whatever it was. The location is so convenient! Just down the stairs is a restaurant with delicious food, a bar with tasty cocktails and local brews on tap, and, on certain nights, live music! A coffee shop and smoothie place both in walking distance for morning fare; for lunch or dinner, a very nice little restaurant and bar across the street, as well. Easy driving distance to a lot of other options. And, lastly, the views - even in winter, the evergreen mountainside is lovely. So excited to see this view in May when I return! Never staying elsewhere!"

Stayed one night","I've already told all of my family and friends that this is THE best airbnb I've stayed in almost 10 years. It truly is 'zen' and quiet, location is beautiful, and the house I adore. Every corner of the little house, porch and garden shows a personal touch of decor and detail that is so peaceful and made me smile. Had a quiet nite of sleep, coffee on the beautiful porch overlooking the pond and watching the busy bees, listening to birds. The only thing one needs to be aware is the blacktop to their road is very winding and you must drive slower. The house is about 15 minutes from the quaint town of Cumberland Gap, LMU and about an hour and half from Cumberland Falls. It's just the best place, I can't say enough. There's another cabin there too, and we will try to get both next time we head to the mountains!"

I also loved that there were more kitchen amenities than pictured or listed( electric kettle, toaster oven, and much more!) another amenity I enjoyed was the mock fireplace heater, which I hadn’t seen pictured either.

We loved all the added touches including the message written on the blanket. The towel warmer was great! There was an assortment of coffee and tea and some oatmeal packets for a quick breakfast. It's a great location if you want to explore Pine Mountain State Resort Park, Kingdom Come or Cumberland Gap. Make sure you check out The Table Coffee House for breakfast in Middlesboro. The chairs were a bit uncomfortable for extended sitting or tv viewing, especially if you have hip issues. One thing that could be a bit awkward depending on who you are staying with was the rule around flushing toilet paper as the house is on a septic system and the owners rules were explicit with not flushing toilet paper down the toilet. (We own a tiny home on a septic and use septic safe toilet paper without a problem, so this was a bit confusing.) Overall, we were very pleased!"

When I got to the house, I found it was gorgeous. It is well decorated and even the space and size of it are wonderful. this is easily the biggest 'tiny house' I've ever stayed in and really got me rethinking my own ideas for building a tiny house.
The communication was stellar. This is the first time I've ever stayed at an Airbnb and never had any questions at all because everything was so perfectly explained.
Having the four cold water bottles in the fridge was just the best, too. Boy did I need some water after all the hiking I did earlier. When the host thinks of details like cold water in the fridge, you know you're at a good spot."

The setting is relaxing enough to even allow a bird family to raise some chicks in the moss-covered birdhouse on the front deck. Unfortunately, I was too busy to not take advantage of all the amenities coming with the Zen. Since my wife and I are thinking of downsizing it was quite interesting to stay in a tiny house. It forces one to be tightly organized which the Zen is. Definitely, a place to enjoy."

Stayed one night","I am so glad this place happened upon me! I was trying to book places and left and right they kept booking at the same time I'd try to book. then I came across this beautiful little cottage, tucked away in the Kentucky mountains. I healing from a lot physically and spiritually. it was a shot, and rejuvenating stay. i arrived late coming from Michigan, after rereading Jacquelines directions since Google misdirected me to the town near by. lesson, Jacqueline is through and should be listened to over Google 😂😉 this place re-entered me. my first morning I sipped coffee on the porch, soakinh in the view, smells, and feels of it all. then I went into a deep meditation. this is usually difficult for me. here I felt safe and grounded. I came out of my meditation to a humming bird flying right infront of my face!! the cottage is full of things to help you with relaxing, healing, meditation, and true self care. I also had a small issue with the AC unit not wanting to turn off. a simple message to Jacqueline, she came to the door, chatted with me to my hearts content, and came back with a remote with new batteries. a simple fix, that she was happy to do and would definitely gone further to get fixed if needed. shes local and knows the area and her guide book is a great one to reference. while it's tucked away, it's not fully secluded. making a solo traveler like myself feel a lot better. I highly recommend this sweet space for your mountain stay for evey reason! the hostess is open hearted and genuine, the location is prime, the beds comfy, and the water pressure Devine! Iwill hopefully be returning here one day. much gratitude to you Jacqueline and the mountains. I needed this stop in my life. 💜"

Stayed one night","This little mountaintop gem was one of the best air bnb spots I've ever visited. the location is remote but gorgeous. The small cottage is absolutely adorable, cozy, clean, comfortable and a great value. Perfect for my niece and I as a waypoint on our return trip home but I hope to stay here for a longer visit and explore the beautiful mountain area. The memory foam bed was amazing. The little snacks and personal touches were noticed and appreciated. Thank you!"

You can do it. Just rock on a rocking chair? Yep! Sit by the pond and listen to the frogs? Ok, you do you. Jackie clearly cares about the space and providing for the guests."

Stayed one night","Hands down one of the best Air B & B's I've ever visited. So peaceful and relaxing!
Jackie is a great host, and very helpful with food selection! The tiny house is situated on a beautiful piece of land with a stunning view of the pond and the forrest. Absolutely splendid!
Really wish I could have gotten to stay a bit longer. Will try to come back in the future if I'm ever passing through KY again."
