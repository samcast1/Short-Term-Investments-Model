Stayed one night","I’d give Carla six stars if I could! This was an absolutely perfect place to get some rest and work before continuing on a very long drive. Carla was incredibly generous with giving me a late checkout, and that made life a whooooole lot easier as I tried to figure out the logistics of several meetings when en route to Boise. The cabin is even nicer than it looks in the pictures. I would’ve happily stayed for a longer and would definitely stay here again. Thank you to Carla for being such a great host and welcoming me to your lovely cabin home!"

If you are looking for a relaxing place to spend a night that feels like home this is the place. So worth the 15 minutes from the interstate. May be the best value left on AirBnB.

Stayed with a pet","We went from Twin Falls to Idaho Falls on Highway 86 and 15. Previously we went through Pocatello. I suggest you skip Pocatello, heading north at American Falls on Highway 39 to the tiny place called Pingree then on to Blackfoot. It is only a few miles extra, but the drive is worth it. You will love driving through the farmlands and rural beauty of Idaho. Stay at Carla’s little Willow Tree Cottage.
It is clean, quiet, peaceful and dog-friendly. Our dog was intrigued with the cows and horses close by. Don’t pass this place by. We liked it so much that we stayed there again going back South.
I recommend this little gem."

Stayed with a pet","It was so nice to drive through the countryside to get to this little cottage. It was so great to see all of the farming. It was clean and very quiet. It is well stocked and had everything we needed.
At first I was surprised that there was no TV. But I think that is a great idea because then you get to really enjoy yourself and relax.
It was nice to sit on the porch and enjoy all of the green grass around the cottage.
We loved having a dog friendly place. It would be nice if it was fully fenced, but we got by just fine.
We liked this cottage so much that we are going to stay again."

Stayed with a pet","Staying at the Willowtree Cottage took me back to a much cherished time in my life when I had the opportunity to live in the country. This peaceful and cozy farmhouse will not disappoint if you can appreciate what it doesn't have, that being frills. It is off the beaten path but still close to necessities. I would not hesitate to book with this host again. Carla is very respectful of your privacy, you will probably only see her in passing as she is doing chores. I am writing this the day after I left as my 2 city dogs are still sleeping off their 4th of July weekend in the country."

All the furniture was very comfortable, and I got to run all my laundry before heading home."

Stayed one night","This cottage was a nice place to stop over and stay during a long road trip. We had our dog with us, and he was able to settle in nicely- no loud noises, cars going by, or other disturbances you get in more populated areas or shared buildings. The living room was so cozy, and we were able to decompress and stay away from screens for the evening, which was relaxing. The space was small and nice, the bed was extremely comfortable, and we were only there for a quick 12 hours, so it was great that check in and check out were speedy and convenient. It is a little out of the way- especially driving up at night through some dark back roads-but directions were clear and description was accurate. If you're looking for somewhere off the beaten path for a very quiet stay, this is your answer."

Stayed a few nights","The cottage is exactly as described. We were pleased with how clean it and how quiet it was. Carla was very friendly.
We are from the city and living on a farm for 2 days was fun. We did, however, discover that our pup at 20 months old couldn’t resist investigating the farm fields and the cows. We found 3/4 of a fence yard had us on edge or her tethered to us. The bathroom was super small and the bed not very comfortable. The cottage is WAY out in the sticks which we now know we don’t prefer, but that is just our preference."

It was really clean and the owner was very nice and welcoming (I happened to arrive as she was working on the property). It was nice that she got to meet my dogs and even let her dog play with mine for an hour or so after we arrived. The bed was comfortable and the cottage was equipped with the basics. There was no TV but, honestly, that was nice. I feel that it allowed me the space to decompress. In the morning the sunrise view was amazing and one of my favorite parts about the cottage, along with the quiet. I would recommend this place to anyone coming through."

Beautiful views of the Snake River and Rockies on Idaho rt 39."

Stayed one night","Carla's place is a quiet retreat from city noise and chaos.
We cooked our dinner in the neat, tidy kitchen and watched the cozy fire while we ate. After dinner we perused the book shelf filled with a broad variety of classic and modern titles, then read ""Castles of the World"" together on the comfy couch under a blanket.
I watched the sunset through the living room windows from the delightful rocking chair, and the sunrise lit up the bedroom through the blinds in the morning.
The bathroom does have a shower/tub combination, but the room is pretty small and tight, with no counter space.
The whole place is very clean and appealingly decorated.
Overall a very quiet, pleasant cottage."

Stayed one night","When we booked our night at Willow Tree Cottage, little did we know that 800 miles from home, our road trip would take an unexpected turn for the worst. We awoke one morning to find our 6-year-old Dachshund, Ragu, paralyzed from the waist down. Fortunately, we were able to find an excellent clinic and surgeon in Salt Lake City. Ragu underwent surgery that same evening. Unfortunately, the road to recovery is going to be long and extensive. He is still not walking to this day. We praise God for Carla’s home, which was clean and cozy. The perfect place for us to care for our little Ragu, while at the same time giving us the chance to unwind, regroup and shed our tears in comfortable privacy."

Now that we have stayed at Willowtree cottage, we would go out of our way to stay there. It brought back memories of happy, relaxed farm life. We checked-in, showered and went to the open house. When we returned, exhausted, the porch light was on, and the fire that operates on thermostat had the whole place cozy so we could just go right to bed. When I got up in the middle of the night needing some water, discovering the bottled water and continental breakfast in the fridge was wonderful!!! We enjoyed our bagels with cream cheese and homemade raspberry jam by the fire in the comfy living room before going on our way. Wish we could have stayed longer."

This was about a 20 minute drive southwest of Blackfoot. It was dog friendly and the yard is fenced on three sides which was very nice. Carla also provided a fully stocked kitchen and left breakfast items in the refrigerator which was a nice surprise. Air conditioning and hot showers were a blessing after a day out in the sun. The bed was very comfortable as well. Thanks again. I have told others about it and they couldn't believe my luck. I am glad I booked it 3 months early.

Stayed a few nights","The stay was exactly what I was looking for. A place that was off the beaten path, where I could rest my head an a clean space and not be at a hotel with my dogs barking at passers by outside. It was nice to have the wrap around driveway and a yard and water hose to air/feed/water my dogs (my dogs are working dogs and do not come in the house). My reason for being in that area was only a few miles away and so location was really convenient for what I needed! the place was very clean! An older cottage for sure, but well kept, updated and super clean, and perfect for my needs with kitchen, laundry room, mud-room etc. Nice touches like the fresh home-grown roses and some basics in the fridge were appreciated. Carla was super friendly and helpful! They live right next door, so I felt like if there was anything I needed (which there wasn't), it would be no problem to ask."

It is a wonderfully cozy home and close enough to Idaho Falls, Blackfoot and Pocatello that they are easy to get to. The cottage is very comfortable and Carla made us feel right at home. The back deck would be a wonderful place to spend a summer or fall evening (were were there in the winter so a little chilly for us though!). We enjoyed the technology free evenings and the walks along the fields. This was a great value and I highly recommend Carla as a hostess."

Stayed over a week","This was a quaint quiet place. The house is fully furnished, and the kitchen is equipped with just about anything you might need. Additionally, there is a grill available. As far as the location, this home is located deep in an agricultural/residential area with views of the Snake River. The place itself, it’s a bit far from town, especially if doing business in Pocatello. Nonetheless, boasts of a serene ambiance, and it is frequented by various wildlife.
During our stay, we were able to see a few moose, mule deer, coyotes, porcupines (alive!!), muskrat, owls, kingfishers, raptors, among many bird’s species. Even got a show by seeing a red tail hawk snatching a poor squirrel. There appeared to be three resident moose that we were able to observe frequently during our last two weeks here. Additionally, the area is dark enough that on clear nights you can even see the trail of the milky way. Great spot for star gazing and sunset watching. Perfect location if you want to escape the city noise and light pollution and like to enjoy nature."

The space was clean upon arrival but it was upsetting when a lot of bugs ended up getting into the second bedroom and we weren't able to use it for the entire month. It had everything we needed to cook and clean for the month including bathroom amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and soap. Very secluded area, quiet. We loved how close we were to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. A hidden gem in the area was Craters of the Moon which was only a short drive away."

The cottage is located in a quiet area and the grocery store is located within a 15 minute drive. There is also a Walmart near the grocery store.

The cottage is a good place to stay if you want to avoid crowed lodging in Jackson Hole, but it’s almost 3 hours away.

I really appreciated how the house felt like a commercial rental but they treated you like old friends who’ve come for a visit. They definitely set the bar for other property owners to follow.

Stayed a few nights",Linda and Amador were absolutely amazing and welcoming hosts. The cottage is super cute and in a secluded area that was easily found and had beautiful views. Everything we needed was ready at check in and all we had to do was get our food for the week.

Stayed one night","Linda & Amador's home is absolutely beautiful!! It was perfect for our stay - I only wish we could have stayed longer. Linda spent time to give us information on going to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National parks. She offered vegetables from her garden, although we didn't have the time to go pick anything. The home is in a beautiful country setting with a big yard. We had a lot of privacy and lots of room in the house. Linda and Amador are wonderful hosts and very friendly. I would highly recommend their AIRBNB to anyone!"

My co-worker and I stayed for a month. Linda’s Cottage is placed perfectly next to Snake river. There is plenty wild life and nature here to see. Its great for fishing, photographers or the nature person that just want to take it all in. The Cottage it’s self is very cozy with everything you need and then some. It’s well located and within 20 min of all you may need.
Linda is very knowledgeable about the area and gave us plenty of sites to see and places to venture to, all which aren’t to far of a drive.
P.S.
Linda makes delicious home made bread!"

There is fishing close to the cabin, major sightseeing spots within easy driving distance, and fabulous scenery. It is where you can leave the concerns of business, home and family behind in this tranquil setting. The hostess could not be more accommodating and enjoyable. We were ready to sign the buyers paperwork, but alas reality returned."

The place was amazing and Linda gave us tips on what to see, where to go and places to avoid on our travels. We chose this place because it was a decent middle ground to what we wanted to do. Lava Hot Springs is only an hour away which the hot soaks are wonderful. A few hours from Salt Lake City, an hour and a half away from The Grand Teton/Yellowstone. The place is off the beaten path which gave us freedom away from our electronics and a beautiful night sky. So if you're in the area and looking for a place, this is a must."

Stayed a few nights","Linda's place is situated in a cosy corner, in a quiet, farm encircled environment next to a meandering river very close to nature.
Linda was there to greet us, even with her busy schedule on arrival evening.
The outside belies what's inside. The whole place is warmly, thoughtfully and affectionately done up as a home. The kitchen's complete and useful. The rooms are lush and beds super comfortable but most importantly, it's lived in. It is very thoughtfully decorated and designed.
The toilet is very lush, it has all and more of all the amenities that's needed. It's complete and more.
I will definitely return if I have a chance to use her place for my base to travel to Yellowstone National Park. It takes 3.5 hrs to reach the West Yellowstone entrance as well as to Jackson, a quaint, lively town with lots to see and do.
Stock up to cook or else you'll have to drive 30 - 40 minutes out to Blackfoot.
It's a great experience that I recommend anyone to try it. You'll love it, just like I did."

You are just 15 minutes or so from Blackfoot and I-15 for adventures beyond. I highly recommend this property - you will NOT be disappointed!"

Stayed with kids","The house is great, and Erin is an awesome host! I highly recommend staying here.
The photos really don't do the place justice. (just FYI, all of the beds come with bedding, even though the photos don't show it, and there are plenty of blankets and pillows in the house.). There are three bedrooms upstairs and two downstairs. We had two adults in the master suite upstairs, a toddler in the second upstairs bedroom, and one adult in each of the two downstairs bedrooms, and we all had plenty of room.
The house is also fairly safe for toddlers. Standard door knob guards fit over all of the bedroom doors, and there's not a ton of decor or furniture that can be easily knocked over or broken.
The drive to Idaho Falls isn't terrible, and it was nice to be out in the country where it's quiet. There's a horse arena right next to the house, and we got to watch them ride horses and lasso cows.
I really don't have any complaints at all. We will definitely book again if we're ever in the area."

In Melissa's defense, I understand that the prior tenants before us stayed an extra day and left the place a complete mess. They were cleaning and getting it ready for us up until the time we pulled in the driveway. After speaking with the neighbors about the prior tenants I was pleased and surprised they got it ready for us in time. If we do the dog show again next year we will definitely stay here again. Melissa was a great host. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

Not only that it is stocked far beyond what one would expect. The best thing though was coming home after work knowing how comfortable the beds are.....You kinda melt and don't want to get back up lol....I would shout from the rooftops to recommend this gem and hopefully already have my reservation in lol.

Any question I had, whether related to the camper or local places to go, they helped. My family and I received free baskets of eggs from their hens and ducks; that was awesome! We had a hiccup the night we arrived (late), and it was addressed the very next morning. The rest of our time at this stay ran smoothly. You will discover they have a large land where you can relax in the sun while your kids run around chasing chickens, ducks, and dogs with a side action on the trampoline. My experience with Dan and Adrian, this Airbnb, and the area has made me heavily consider moving to Idaho - said a city girl born and raised. In the meantime, I will stay here again! Thank you, Dan and Adrian, for everything! God Bless you both and your family!"

The farm stay was wonderful for our little one. The camper van itself was nothing short of amazing – it was spotlessly clean and beautifully designed. The meticulous attention to detail, combined with the hosts' welcoming nature, created an unforgettable experience. From the well-equipped kitchenette to the cozy sleeping area, every aspect of the camper van was thoughtfully crafted to ensure a delightful stay. In retrospect, the only regret we have is not extending our visit, but that just adds to the cherished memories we carry with us. We will comeback soon to eat fresh farm egg!"

They took the time to get to know us and made us feel like we were staying with friends rather than strangers.
I cannot recommend Dan and Adrian's Airbnb enough. If you are looking for a place to stay where you will be treated like family, this is the perfect choice.

Dan took us on a tour of all of their wonderful projects...He has done so much! The yard is magical at night!
The trailer was extremely clean and comfortable! It had all of the amenities that we needed and fresh eggs in the fridge! Lots of info on local things to do and places to eat etc.
We loved meeting the dogs and just enjoying the beautiful surroundings!
Dan took time to show us through their tiny house and shared with us some of their dreams for the future and the property is going to be even more wonderful!
We will absolutely be back the next time we need to take a trip north! Happy to pass their place along to friends and family!"

Their property is really fun for kids who enjoy being around animals. My daughter loved seeing the chickens, ducks, and dogs. If you're into the small farm lifestyle and just want things to be accessible without the city in your face, this is the place for you! It felt like I was walking into a kids' dream. I wish my plans allowed us to really spend more time there to use the fireplace and walk around."

Stayed with kids","It was as if the owners handed us the keys to their own immaculate 6 bedroom home and said stay here for a couple of days. This is a real home with fantastic art on the walls, all the amenities you would desire, nice quality beds, and furniture, etc. - as opposed to a property someone simply bought and outfitted on the cheap to rent out on Airbnb. It was truly a relaxing oasis for our party of eight – so much so that our 11-year-old said he did not want to leave (he had the living room bunk-bed haven to himself and played ping-pong with various family members for hours).
Trent went out of his way to make our stay perfect and responded to any questions we had both before our stay and during within a few minutes. I highly recommend staying at any of his places because he truly gets what hospitality is all about.
Thank you Trent for being an amazing human being and creating a fabulous and fantastic oasis in Blackfoot where we made memories we will fondly cherish throughout our lives."

Stayed with kids","We drove in from Las Vegas for a family event, and our time at Wilson Family Retreat ended up being the highlight of the trip! First of all, so clean! Way cleaner than a hotel. And relaxing—all premium linens, relaxing decor and major attention to detail. We all slept great! Beds are super comfortable and the area is quiet. Plenty of bathrooms and mirrors for everyone to get ready. Large kitchen and so much space for everyone to either join in the fun, or take a break for a nap or enjoy a good book.
We highly recommend getting fun, custom sodas at “Pick Me Up” in Blackfoot, ordering some pizza and enjoying a family game night! We had so many laughs just hanging out at the house playing games together. The kids were entertained for hours building “forts” at the bunk beds, Mom finally learned how to play poker at the legit poker table, and we enjoyed a little nostalgia beating the younger kids at the classic arcade games. There is a fire pit and a grill—everything you need to build precious family memories! And the location is so convenient for access to the interstate and all the adventure and dining this area has to offer. Definitely booking again!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay here for a week was pretty good overall. There’s a few things to keep in mind when booking (listed below), but I was very impressed at how proactive and responsive she was to answer questions and see to the issues that came up.
Pros:
-clean
-spacious
-felt like new/well cared for
-comfortable beds and bedding
-AC worked wonderfully
-had all the listed amenities
Cons:
-had a residual cigarette smoke smell, which she promptly worked to address by buying us some air fresheners.
-internet was slow, about 3-5Mb download speed when we did a speed test. If we turned Wi-Fi off on other devices, we could watch a show no problem though.
-internet kept shutting off, which she said could happen if the modem (sitting on the ground) gets bumped. I think my kids being a bit rambunctious in the living room made it rattle, causing it to shut off. Just something to be aware of if you have rambunctious kids like me, haha.
Overall, it was a nice, comfortable place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Bethany’s Nest is the perfect stay! Everything about it was easy, simple and immaculately clean. We didn’t need much help during our stay but Bethany was communicative and so nice. I would highly recommend this place for a small group like ours. I would stay here again if I make my way back to Blackfoot."

Stayed with kids","From the minute we opened the door, we felt the warmth and care the host put into this house. We had a large family group of 16 and from the extra large dining table to the furniture layout, to the wall decor, the house was made for family. We hung out in the dining room and around the large kitchen island playing games. Everything was spotless. There were plenty of linens provided for everyone even though we were a large group. Communication by the host was terrific. All of our family agreed this was the best Airbnb/Vrbo we had stayed at. My only regret is that we may not need something this large again since family gathered for our granddaughters graduation from ISU. However, if this host ends up with additional smaller units in the future, I would certainly highly consider staying at one of his properties. This particular stay couldn't have been more perfect for our needs of this trip."

Stayed a few nights",Super cute tiny house with gorgeous views! Super stocked kitchen; we cooked a lot during our stay. And I love that there isn't a list of chores to do + a huge cleaning fee. Hot tub was great during sunset as well. We had a great time relaxing - and driving into Idaho Falls for groceries was quick and easy. Would recommend!

Stayed about a week","The Shelley Tiny House was a fantastic and neatly modern location to spend a week over the holiday. The house was clean and welcoming with a small snack basket, plenty of pillows and blankets, and a sparse but functional kitchen with about every utensil you might need. We enjoyed cooking and baking and playing board games in the small downstairs area. The only real downside was the firmness of the beds but it was not so much so as to disrupt our entire stay. Everything was well stocked and check in and out was easy. Our host also shoveled the walks when it snowed and we were out for the evening. We enjoyed the views and the quietness of the location."
