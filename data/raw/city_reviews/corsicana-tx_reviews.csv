Stayed about a week","Such a great house! I felt right at home in this brand new, squeaky clean home. Bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spectacular, and the Roku TV was a nice touch. Loved the shared, but ample storage space for each guest in the kitchen cupboards, refrigerator, and freezer. Location was on the outskirts of town, but was peaceful and a short drive to Walmart, Aldi, has stations, and restaurants. Would definitely recommend!"

Downtown Corsicana is a short drive away and offers good food and good shopping in a quiet atmosphere. If you’re more into the city, Dallas was just 45 minutes away. So glad to have stayed at Trail of Faith and hope to return again in the future."

Stayed one night","We absolutely LOVED staying here! It exceeded our expectations. Susie and Doug were both incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Susie opened the farmhouse for us to get a delicious grass fed sirloin steak, beef sticks, grass fed butter, an amber candle, and the cutest cow trivet! The property was beautiful especially with all of the bluebonnets and other wildflowers. The steak and beef sticks were seriously incredible! Don’t leave without trying some of those beef sticks! The house was immaculately clean and I was pleased to find the kitchen fully stocked with any spices or kitchenware that I needed to cook dinner. The air conditioner worked fabulously as well! I appreciated the eco-conscious supplies around the house. We took a farm tour in the morning and even got to see the birth of a new calf! What a wonderful experience. I can’t recommend Susie & Doug’s place enough, it was everything I was hoping it would be and more!"

They were available when I felt like hanging out and respected my privacy when I was seeking quiet, solo time. They went above and beyond in their efforts to make sure I had what I needed. The bunkhouse is tastefully decorated, full of amenities and comfortable. It was the perfect place to get away, relax and renew in a beautiful natural setting."

Stayed with kids","The Ranch is an amazing place. Susie & Doug are awesome people! We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and very thankful for the time spent there. Kids loved the friendly animals. Susie even gave them lessons about being better stewards of the land. This was a great place for us to unwind and let the kids roam free.
On the house front - the place is clean, with all the amenities needed. Kitchen had everything needed for quick cooking. The bathroom was spotless, beds were comfortable. We felt like everyone got their own space to do what they needed to do. Sitting outside and doing nothing was awesome. The fireplace outside is perfect for spring evenings.
We cannot thank Susie and Doug enough for the company, the conversation and help during our stay. Thank you again!"

I was also able to fish in one of their ponds and caught several nice bass. We will be back!

Stayed one night","I cannot say enough about Susie and Doug!
We booked later in the day, but still received quick replies, recommendations for dinner, and was greeted upon arrival!
Where to even begin?
The Bunkhouse was so welcoming and charming….. there was a little Christmas tree inside and lights left on!
Amenities were incredible……. Water in the fridge, microwave popcorn, coffee, local honey….. to list just a few!
Linens were crisp and clean……. Beds had lots of blankets (which I love), and mattresses so comfy!
The next morning was a one of kind experience meeting the longhorn herd and visiting the on sight market…….. which has all local selections and incredible fresh from the farm selections as well!
If you are looking for an actual experience…… and love animals……. Do not wait another minute! Book now!
We hope to return!"

We will NEVER again try to find a hotel next to the interstate when we come to this part of Texas. Go ahead, read the hotel reviews… they are mostly HORRIBLE! You will not regret taking the short drive to their little slice of heaven. Susie’s Market store is awesome! We loaded up on locally canned products, butter, and some great “Trail of Faith” chicken. Thank you Doug and Susie for letting us experience your ranch… we will be back! Five stars for sure."

Stayed a few nights","The Trail of Faith Ranch was a wonderful place to stay a few days and enjoy the peaceful and natural surroundings. It is less than 10 miles west of Interstate 45, between Corsicana and Ennis, TX. Susie and Doug are excellent hosts; Susie spent time with us to answer our many questions about the ranch's animal residents and the ranch operations. She took us to meet their Longhorn herd and that was a great visit with many photo opportunities. We were provided fresh eggs for breakfast and homemade banana bread to sample. One of the highlights was roasting marshmallows and making s'mores at the firepit right outside the ""Bunkhouse"" (our quarters for our stay). It was a fun stay, and a perfect base of operations for our wildflower/bluebonnets searches. We found some beautiful patches and fields nearby of gorgeous bluebonnets and Indian Paintbrushes and many other flowers. We really enjoyed our Spring trip!"

We bought some steaks from the farm store too and they were absolutely delicious. We would love to return someday soon! Would highly recommend staying here.

Stayed one night","Susie's bunkhouse was/is one of the best Airbnb's we've ever stayed at in our 12 years of staying at Airbnbs around the world. Doug took us on a tour of their longhorns and my family of four will never forget it. The bunkhouse is super clean and comfortable. The beds in both bedrooms give a great night's sleep. The bathroom sparkles with plenty of towels. The kitchen is well stocked. Susie's grass-fed products in her store are exceptional at a good price. It's off the beaten path, 45 minutes out of downtown Dallas, but SO WORTH the drive. I wish I could give 10 stars for overnight at their Trail of Faith Ranch. Thank you Susie and Doug for the lifetime memories. Hope to see you soon."

Stayed one night","If you are looking for a fun escape to the countryside, this is a perfect spot to relax and see a working farm! We had a wonderful stay in the nicely decorated bunkhouse. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we had all the amenities in the kitchen to make our own meals. When walking around the property we would often be greeted by the owners’ friendly dogs who were very sweet. The location of the farm is perfect for anyone wanting to venture into downtown Corsicana or Ennis. We saw a movie at the Galaxy Drive-In which was only a short 20 min drive from the farmhouse. Susie was an excellent host with quick and helpful communication and we really enjoyed meeting her upon our arrival. We hope to make the bunkhouse our ""go-to"" spot whenever in the area."

It was in the outskirts of town, but didn't take long to get to the downtown area that was very charming. 6 of us we're in the home. It was very comfortable,, nice and clean, welll kept up, comfortable beds, extra bedding for the pullout couch and the linens we clean and soft, we had a very enjoyable stay! The cost was fair, and what i expected for the event that brought us to Texas! There was train tracks on the other side of the parking lot fence, and we did have trains that came by several times in the evening! If I visited Corsicana again, I would definitely stay at Joshua's place again!!"

Group trip","When we walked in Josh's place, we all said, ""This is great and clean."" It was a perfect design for what we needed. It was very, very clean and all details were considered in their planning for guests. Our beds were great, wifi was great, and the coffee already there was great for our arrival.
Our ONLY complaint is the train that was not disclosed in the listing. Since we weren't aware of the fact it's literally beside the house, combined with the fact we got to the house after dark and there is a fence blocking the train, we had no indicator a train was nearby until we woke up severely startled - the loudest train I have ever heard.
Other than that, Josh was a great host and the house was a great place for our needs."

The train is practically a rocks throw away but it didn’t bother or wake the kids during the night. It was actually kinda pleasant. The only concern was the wall between the other tenant is very thin allowing you to hear when regularly talking. My kids love to talk which resulted in the neighbor asking us to keep them more quiet. Other than that all was well!

I was thrown off a bit because it is not a single family home so make sure to check maps for an aerial view before arrival. Also the 'backyard' is the railroad so you'll hear it pass though it didn't bother me. I was impressed with the awareness of sensitivities around household products. Hosts were quick to respond and gave clear instructions. I will save this as a favorite for the times I visit in the future.

This hidden gem was perfectly located 10 minutes from downtown and where we needed to be. I can’t say enough about how wonderful they were about checking in on me to make sure I had everything I needed.
I’ve stayed at quite a few airb&bs, but this one was a top 5. The animals on the property were a nice surprise.

Stayed with kids","Our family had an amazing stay at this place! It was exactly what we all needed. Home, pool and property are all beautiful. The home is spacious and everyone had their own space. It is beautifully decorated and clean. Kitchen was stocked with more basic necessities than I expected and plenty of towels and essentials. Kids either stayed in the pool all day or at the pond fishing. (We caught a fish as soon as the line hit the water)The large outdoor tv under the patio and the grill/kitchen area was a wonderful plus. Also loved the steam shower!! Katie the host was great and very attentive. She answered all questions quickly before and during our stay. This home/property is truly a wonderful place to stay. The kids are already begging to come again and stay longer next time. I highly recommend this wonderful home, it is truly a gem."

Group trip","This was a beautiful place to stay. It was within 10 mins of anything you needed. The house stayed cool and comfortable. There was plenty of space for us.
We stayed three nights on a girls trip. Only one of those days we were able to use the pool. There were no pool lights (or no instructions on how to turn them on) we were unable to swim in the late afternoon. The pool got foggy and we weren't able to swim. This was disappointing especially since we paid more for a house with a pool.
The property is beautiful, however there are people all around working on the property coming in and out of the gates.
The water heater was not working in the master the first night, but someone came and fixed it the next afternoon.
The kitchen house itself had everything we needed and was very clean."

Stayed with kids","This place is FANTATISTIC. The grounds and house were clean, and there was plenty of space throughout for all of our stuff and then some. The fencing around porch, yard and pool were extremely convenient, as we had a little one with us. There were some minor issues around the house, but to be expected when it is rented out everyday, and the host was quick to make sure they did not impede our visit. My one complaint was I wish the construction around the property was disclosed before our arrival, as there is quite a bit of heavy machinery moving about the property. Though it did not hinder our good time at all. (And also no pool slide as shown in pictures) But must finish with - this is a such a gem and I truly cannot wait to stay there again! Already searching for a weekend we are free."

Stayed one night","We were barely at the AirBnB and mostly just there to sleep, so it did the job! It's cozy and clean. I'm in interior design, so in my humble opinion, it could use some updating but I am always dreaming of home updates! But I also understand what it's being used for. It's cute enough and convenient to the historic center of town. 3 minutes to the Palace Theater. Easy parking, etc. Very equipped with coffee items, which makes me happy! Again, we didn't spend much time there, so I can't speak to all the amenities, but the place did the job, cold AC, good WiFi, plenty of space! Betina was very, very sweet and easy to talk to. If you choose to stay here, don't be surprised that the outside is a little unkept; the building itself and the street that it's on, but once you're inside, you feel like you're at Grandma Hannah's home! Inviting and warm."

Stayed with kids","Overall I give it a solid 4. Maybe 4.5. Here is why I didn't give it a 5.
1- there is no TV. I know it says no TV in the ad, but it's 2022, even if streaming only I want a TV. Even if it's for local news or white noise while we go to bed. Board games can't put me to sleep.
2- It's dark outside the entry door at night. The neighborhood isn't the nicest, so we would pull up get out quick and go in and lock the door. I'd recommend a bright or brighter exterior light on the front and rear doors to the unit.
3- If you sleep downstairs on the couch and are a light sleeper, you will hear trains all night, ask me how I know. Once again not a fault of the host, she was great, but I heard trains multiple times at night.
Listen, once you are inside the unit it's great, comfy and cozy. So if you are like us, we couldn't find a hotel and needed a place to stay for the night, then this is your place. If you are looking for a place with outdoor areas to hang out and enjoy, maybe not so much. For what it was and is and we needed, it's great. Just needs a couple of mimor things to be a 5 star. (like make sure the air vents are open upstairs or you will be like me sleeping on the couch down stairs hearing trains all night only realizing the next morning why it's so hot upstairs is because someone shut the air vents. Also one of the dmok detectors was missing a battery and the detector was open, might snug those up next time)
It does have a full kitchen, comfy couch, breakfast table and bund beds which my kids liked. Also has a washer and dryer."

She had cancer and we were trying to fulfill her last wish. When we stayed at the airbnb we had to take her to the hospital because she wasn't feeling well. We left the place around 5AM and to my surprise the managers refunded our stay without us asking. I would highly recommend this property and the folks running it.
I just wanted to give a special thank you to the owners for helping when we were most in need. I will always remember it."

This was not safe in our opinion for our 2 year old with the fall risk as the stairs are right there. Other then that we enjoyed our stay.

Three loft beds were comfortable, downstairs bed was comfortable, upstairs bed was okay. It sleeps ""8"", but there will not be enough seating for eight. Four dining chairs, which we had to pull over to seat six of us in the living area. I would not say it is ""totally renovated"". It was nicely refurbished with some older remnants remaining. Nicely decorated. We don't eat out, so we cooked with the older stove, which is AMAZING! Love older appliances, they work so much better than modern."

Stayed with kids","Similar to other reviewers, we opted for this listing instead of a hotel, and feel like we got much more for our money here and were able to have a comfortable stay.
We stayed for almost an entire week and found we had almost everything we needed to comfortably live in the air bnb without multiple trips to the store or having to eat out nightly.
This listing was very comfortable for our family of four, but could have easily slept three more. Kitchen had all necessary appliances and most cookware we would need. Beds were comfortable and living area spacious with two private bedrooms (bunk beds at the top of the stairs were great for our two young children.) There is a gated courtyard for kids to run around in with a large pecan tree for shade.
This location is in downtown Corsicana, literally one street away from an HEB grocery store and blocks from historic downtown. Don't forget to go to the famous Collin Street Bakery just minutes away!
Church bells from the beautiful church across the street charmed us during the day, although our nearness to the fire and police department did mean we had some siren noises at night.
This listing felt safe for our family and as we come to town again to visit relatives, this will be our first check for availability for our accommodations."

Stayed with kids","Let me start off by saying that the property is beautiful and the location was perfect but the uncleanliness of the home made me very uncomfortable due to my health issues and my small babies. There was hair, red liquid stains and crumbs on the stove top and dinning table. I decided to go do a quick check of the home and in the tub I found little hair and some nasty throw up looking spots with some food crumbs also in site was in the tube so I assumed it was throw up. I immediately contacted the host and kindly explained what I found and she told me “You’re just simply not satisfied and that’s fine. Unless someone came in after I left, it was spotless, so please leave and get a hotel.” She asked me twice to leave and get a hotel and she would send someone over soon as I leave to lock the house up and informed me she would give me a full refund. It was her demeanor, for me. Very nasty response instead of offering assistance. Even though I was going to leave anyways. Her not knowing I didn’t have to get a hotel, I live two hours away. So we drove home and got in our big Cali bed👋"

All the rooms are well lit, which is something I always look for after staying in too many other rentals that were dark caves. The host is very quick to respond, and we didn't have any issues during our weekend stay."

Talk about small town hospitality, and going above and beyond. Wow. Great experience. Check out Corsicana and stay HERE."

Comfortable beds, a good setup for our group of 6 adults -- about 20 mins from the lovely town of Corsicana while still being right on the lake. We went on a guided fishing trip on the lake that was awesome -- highly recommended! Just like any property like this in this location, expect plenty of bugs and a few quirks -- and be sure to stock up on groceries, ice, wood for the fire pit, and any other provisions before you head out as there really isn't much out on the Lake -- and even the services on the lake are 20 mins away. All in all a wonderful experience and very nice country accommodations!"

I saw several wild deer, Texas Longhorn cattle, and other wildlife as I drove to and from property. The natural beauty of this space was not ruined by the bussle of traffic, loud music or other noises common in the city. Almost forgot that the entire house appears to have been refinished within months, beautiful flooring, spacious island kitchen, TV in each Bedroom and spaces for family to sit and enjoy each others company. We enjoyed the fire pit, BBQ grille, fishing pier, boat dock, patio furniture and even the drive once we got off the major highway. We will be booking with Green again in Summer 2024."

The sunrise and sunset views over the lake are worth every pothole! Located in a very quiet neighborhood! The house is fully stocked with all necessities! Our only complaint was the beds are a little hard for our taste, but some people may love that! The host offered to see what he could do to correct the issue for the future!
Highly recommend heading into Corsicana for the day and exploring their historic downtown. The Across the Street Diner was delicious! Also, it's a little further out, but we found a hidden gem for dinner in Trinidad - The Whistlestop!"

Now we have a beautiful spot to revisit. Kathleen cared about our needs before arriving for our visit. What a Super Host! The place was super clean and the beds were very comfortable. You could relax on the porch and enjoy the nice country scenery. Great stay and vacation.
Sincerely,
Happy Guests"

We didn't think that having the bathrooms upstairs was a big problem. Communication regarding entry and exit was really good. I would recommend it."

Group trip","My group was in town for an event at Texas Motorplex, so this house was only about 30 minutes away. There are easy food and grocery options in the immediate area. The house itself is older but large and comfortable. The gated driveway made us feel safer about leaving items in the car overnight, instead of carrying them back and forth to the house. The host provided plenty of extra pillows, bedding, and towels in the upstairs linen closet and main bathroom, respectively. Just be aware that both bathrooms are upstairs. It was not a problem for our group, but may be an issue for people with mobility issues. Also the en suite bathroom shower does not have a fixed showerhead, it is handheld only.
Overall the house was perfect for our needs and we enjoyed our stay!"

The game room was a plus for our nieces and nephews, and the yard being fenced in made us feel like we were in our own world. We enjoyed it very much and will plan to use it again when we visit."

The rooms felt mostly clean and the bathrooms were very clean. The kitchen did not seem as clean and the carpets were stained. We also had a big cockroach the first night there which caused concern about having little ones crawling around on the floor."

Stayed a few nights","A Perfect Stay in Downtown Corsicana.
I recently had the pleasure of revisiting a charming Airbnb in downtown Corsicana, and it was just as delightful as my first stay. The location is simply unbeatable, especially for those attending events like the Annual Derrick Days Festival. Nestled in the heart of downtown, it offers convenience and easy access to all the festivities.
The accommodation itself is top-notch, with every comfort and amenity thoughtfully provided. From the cozy furnishings to the well-equipped kitchen, everything was immaculate and inviting. Whether lounging after a day of exploring or preparing a quick meal before heading out, the space was both functional and stylish.
The host was friendly, responsive, and accommodating, they truly go above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. I definitely will recommend this place to anyone visiting Corsicana and I plan on rebooking this spot in the future."

Neat shops, several good restaurants, and even a 25 foot Christmas tree!"

Stayed a few nights","* * * * * BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT * * * * *
Vermin in the unit and an indifferent property manager - I will never return, nor can I recommend this location
AirBNB had to step in in order to resolve this case appropriately - They were very professional and I sincerely appreciate their expert assistance
Resolution was:
- Full refund of 2 nights lodging
- Payment of the cleaning and additional fees
- Definitely fair
* * * * * DETAILS * * * * *
First impression was a great one - Nice, quirky and generally comfortable little place - Reminded me of traveling in Europe.
Access to the unit was efficient - Communication with the owner was easy.
* * * * * INITIAL PROBLEM: BARKING DOG * * * * *
Neighbor's dog barking in a neighbor's yard right in back of the unit until 1:30am - Very loud; sounded like it was right on the other side of the wall - Not the owner's fault, but it did impact my stay
* * * * * LARGER PROBLEM: VERMIN IN THE UNIT * * * * *
Shocked awake at 2:30am by an insect crawling on my leg, under the covers. Jumped up, turned on the light and saw a large cockroach next to the bed - Which I immediately killed. Sleep for the rest of the night was near impossible, as a result.
As I went to shower in the morning, I saw another cockroach - But that one escaped under the baseboard before I could kill it.
While leaving, a third cockroach appeared between the bedroom and the bathroom - This was the largest of the three I saw - I stomped that one to death and left both cockroach corpses in place when I departed.
I reported the problem to the owner that morning. She assured me she would be having an exterminator visit but didn't seem overly concerned, saying every house in the area had them (due to the heat), but added ""we them water bugs"" - Which I felt really trivialized the gravity of having cockroaches in a lodging unit.
Candidly, it doesn't matter what you call them - ""Water Bugs"" or Cockroaches - Who wants to wake up to one crawling on their leg? NOBODY!
* * * * * FINAL PROBLEM: INTERACTION WITH THE OWNER * * * * *
The next day I asked the owner if she planned to do anything to make the situation right before I submitted this review.
I felt having a positive response from her included in the review should temper the negatives a bit, and I wanted to give her another chance to respond positively.
She wanted to know what I thought was fair - I wanted to see what she thought was right without prompting from me, and I told her so.
She didn't understand and apparently got the impression I was trying to ""extort"" her (she clearly doesn't know what that word means) and told me so. She also said the conversation was ""getting weird"" and refused to continue the discussion.
This owner seems hyper-focused on control measures and takes great pains to focus on rules for her rental. It's unfortunate she's not as motivated to provide good customer service.
I gave the owner a chance to respond in a positive manner, but she either didn't understand, or just wasn't interested - So take that as you will.
* * * * * BOTTOM LINE * * * * *
Vermin in the unit and an indifferent property manager - I will never return, nor can I recommend this location
AirBNB had to step in in order to resolve this case appropriately - They were very professional and I sincerely appreciate their expert assistance

NOTES:
1. Cleanliness Rating Explained = Clean on the surface; rated low due to vermin in the unit
2. Any negative comments from the owner should be balanced by all my reviews from the past 10 + years"

Stayed a few nights","The bungalow is a really cute two story place. The kitchen and livingroom are on the second floor. There is a spiral staircase going up that is small and narrow. It is made for skinny young people who are steady on their feet. There is s metal staircase outside that goes up to the kitchen. I had to hold my 18 gal totes sideways to go up the stairs. It's really dark outside at night and I didn't know how to turn the lights on so for me it was scary. The place sleeps three upstairs and five downstairs. There is a Murphy bed, a single cot and the king size bed. The first floor toilet has a macerator and it's loud but not continuous. Overall a nice place"

Stayed one night","Upon arriving to the place I quickly noticed a gas smell that I attribute it to it being a gas run oven and stove. Once I went upstairs The smell became much stronger. It was a bit nauseating if I’m being honest. Once I try to make dinner The oven would not preheat. I left it to preheat for over an hour and it did not get hot. So my guess and I were forced to use the microwave In order to cook our food. The toilet has a sound that is quite loud! It would start up on its own minutes after flushing and continue to make loud noises that woke my guests. This was an adequate place to stay for ONE NIGHT ONLY. I personally don’t think i could’ve stayed longer than that. For the price I would’ve expected all functioning appliances. Also the “outside staircase” should actually be labeled an emergency exit as it should only be used in emergencies ONLY. It was flimsy and felt unstable. The spiral staircase is NARROW so take that into consideration.
On a personal note: I was made to feel uncomfortable by the MULTITUDE of questioning I received from the host about why I wanted to take a vacation on my birthday. I completely understand them wanting to protect their property and their space. However there is a right way and a wrong way to go about questioning someone, and based off of my experience they did it the wrong way and it rubbed me the wrong way. For me personally, The questioning I received in combination with the experience that I had once there, is not, nor was not worth the price point. Furthermore, I’d advise future guests to be mindful when booking this property that they WILL heavily question you on your intentions. The bed was comfortable enough though and I’m grateful for them allowing us to stay, regardless of being disappointed by the experience."
