Stayed a few nights","This airbnb is even cuter in person! Peaceful and welcoming surroundings around the home. Has plenty of space for a couple and if an additional person is ok with sleeping on a twin air mattress, there is space and sleeping room for one more. There is no queen air mattress as stated. Sleeping on the comfy reclining couch could allow for a fourth. The private backyard and deck was great to sit at for sipping coffee. They have added a small table and chairs off the kitchen to sit at and a table and chairs outside on the deck as well. A wonderful stay overall 😊"

Rolando was quick to respond to messages and accommodated the request that we had, which we were very grateful for. I am bummed my son wasn't able to come along on this trip, because the play equipment in the backyard looked pretty awesome. The coffee/hot chocolate station was a nice touch."

We were able to buy groceries and eat breakfast in the house, pack lunches, and even cook dinner in the kitchen and on the grill. There was plenty of space for four adults and two teenagers to sleep. The hosts were very responsive and went out of their way to make us comfortable. If we find ourselves back in Mount Pleasant, we would definitely stay here again!"

Comfortable beds with crisp linens and luxurious blankets. Bathrooms have fluffy towels and premium TP. Full kitchen with everything you need including a complementary case of water. Amazing coffee bar with both drip and K cup supplies perfectly complemented with quality chocolate mints. The icing on the cake has to be the owners attentiveness which was greatly appreciated. We got 6 inches of snow overnight and both the vehicles and driveway were cleared up first thing in the morning. When the coffee pot brewed its last cup and gave up on us the owners came through with a brand new one. That kind of service really is above and beyond! All in all I am more than satisfied with the property. I would highly recommend this property if you are looking for a great place to stay while in town.

The kitchen was very well stocked if you chose to cook. They thought of all the comforts of home. We will definitely stay there the next time we go to Mt. Pleasant. It was cold and snowing while we were there, but I hope next time we will get to use the lovely patio with the grill and firepit. Excellent place!"

The beds and furniture were so comfortable, and my family and I sure loved the frosted windows around the house, these factors made for some great beauty sleep. Photos don't do it justice.. the space is so open, and was much larger than I expected. Will certainly come back again if in the area. One of my favorite convenient amenities was that the TVs allow you to set it up so that you are logged out of all your accounts at the end of your stay.
Lots of parks and restaurants close by, within walking distance to CMU and downtown.

We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the space, the fresh linens, and friendly atmosphere. Will definitely stay again if we are in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","I had such an amazing solo getaway here. This stay was the closest to a ""hotel"" feel, of any bnbs I've been to. You might see a cleaning cart or other people come and go in the hallway, it was one of the cleanest stays I've had. Mints on your towels, and they even provided simple slippers. I broke a piece of stemware on the second day and they were beyond kind about it. It can get noisy outside depending on the people leaving area bars at night or gathering for breakfast downstairs in the morning, but I loved that. (and they provide earplugs if you're more sensitive to it!) This isn't supposed to be a silent cabin stay. It was a snowy weekend and it felt like I dropped into a Hallmark movie."

The location is easy to find and right in downtown Clare. Parking on the street (on the weekday I was there) was right in front.
The space is located a beautifully remodeled and re-purposed second floor in a 100+ year old building. The West suite is spacious, clean & comfortable, with a modern kitchen and a well thought out large bathroom with a soaker tub & separate shower.
We found Clare to be friendly and welcoming town with good options for casual dining. The site is centrally located in town with great walkability.
Hope to return soon for a more extended stay!"

Morgan was incredibly welcoming and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The apartment itself was spotlessly clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. One of the things I loved most about this Airbnb was the location - the town was very quaint with good restaurants and shops within walking distance. We enjoyed our time at Four Leaf Brewing talking to the bartender as well as the owner of Calla Lily Mercantile!
We really wanted to visit the speakeasy but we got back too late on Thursday and they were already closed. We found out from a shop owner that St. Patrick's Day is quite the party so we may try to come back next year and stay again!"

The Trap Door had good food but was out of a few toppings, and drinks were very expensive. Overall, more of an exspiernce to check out with a prohibution feel and some servers wearing flapper girl dresses, which i thought was super cool! Breakfast at 505 Cafe never disappoints with great coffee and food as well! The only concern was that the shower head in the bathroom definitely could be updated, and the bed was much too hard for me and my bf. Place was clean and will definitely be back for date night!"

We didn’t and several of them were closed when we were able to go. We had a little trouble finding the parking lot but found another one instead that was also free. The town is quite small so it wasn’t a long walk to the space even with our parking snafu. I also forgot the title of the listing said east suite so it took us awhile to figure out which apartment it was. But it had a Super easy lock system once we figured it out. I was a little bummed the fireplace wasn’t real but it still added to the nice ambiance of the space. We loved the old building and being right above a cafe. It was such a relaxing stay!"

You can walk to anything in Clare from this room, and there are plenty of cool boutique shops and small restaurants to check out. Make sure you get coffee and breakfast at the cafe downstairs at least once. The room also come with a coffee maker and French press so you don’t have to leave to get your fix in the AM.

There were so many thoughtful inclusions (like the white noise machine, fan, toiletries, Netflix, etc.) Being walking distance to pretty much everything in downtown Clare was awesome! The cafe was really good for breakfast (closed Tuesdays though) and there wasn't too much noise being right upstairs. There was a bit of traffic noise, but that didn't bother us. The bay window was great for watching what was going on downtown! Overall, we had an awesome stay and visit, and hope to be back again sometime!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I trying to get away for our anniversary each year and we found that we really enjoy smaller quant towns. We live in the hustle and bustle of Columbus Ohio and wanted to venture some place that wasn’t Ohio. Although we love home, we’ve visited most of the smaller town near and far. Morgan’s place popped up on a search and we both loved the look and where it was located. The place was super cute but a bit noisy from the main road just outside our windows. We brought a high powered fan which helped during the night but after about 9 it quiets down significantly. There was a wedding next door that wasn’t mentioned until the week were coming to stay. Morgan was very sweet to offer a full refund but hoped would still come. We decided to come since we had already started the scheduling process of or plans and hadn’t had a back up… we need much time a way! If you plan to visit just make sure there isn’t a wedding or perhaps a party right next door if you can’t handle the noise. Sweet little place to stay and a sweet little town as well as great ma and pa places to eat within walking distance."

There was less to do in town than I had hoped, but that’s more on me not doing enough research. My only other disappointment was the bed was very firm, which would be great for back sleepers but got pretty uncomfortable for us side sleepers, even after just one night.
Overall though, definitely the best place in town to stay! PS check out the cafe below for brunch."

Great location right in the middle of town and easy to get to the brewery down the street or cafe and bakery below. Overall there can be a bit of noise (old building, on Main Street, etc.) but there’s a white noise machine and supplied earplugs to make it pleasant for light sleepers. We were unlucky and came on a very very hot day causing the AC units to work overtime and make funky noises. Morgan very quickly responded and offered to move us into the other unit which was over the top and speaks to the level of detail put into these places."

Stayed one night","The apartment is beautiful and very clean! The decor and little touches are all wonderful. I had a bit of bad luck my entire stay, but made the best of it. The power was out most of the day in Clare, so a lot of the stores and restaurants remained closed. My plan was to spend the evening relaxing in the apartment, so aside from restaurants and shops closing from the power outage, it didn’t change much for me. However, from 6-11PM it sounded like a rave going on from a party at the event space. I’m a musician myself, so I don’t mind loud noise... just not when I am out of town for a relaxing weekend with my boyfriend. Unfortunately, it was impossible to relax with the constant booms from the music, the guests and cars dropping/picking people up outside on the street below, and noise from the DJ and loud voices at the party. (Keep this in mind if you’re looking for a quiet get away) Once the party ended, I was able to relax and unwind, and it was really nice watching the rainy night time view from the bay window. (The swivel chairs are a great touch!) In the morning I had to turn the noise machine on as there was some noise from people at the cafe below. I was hoping to have coffee and brunch at the cafe after checkout since it was closed upon our arrival due to the power outage, (I made changes to my schedule so we could have brunch before heading out), but the espresso machine was broken. (more of my bad luck for the weekend, haha) We really wanted coffee, so we did not go to the cafe. (I have ate at the cafe once before and it’s great!) Other than the noise, and unfortunate events that aren’t in anyone’s control, the space is beautiful, clean, well maintained, and a really great idea having the cafe, venue, and suites all together. Morgan does a great job with all of the businesses. I’d recommend the venue/cafe/upper suites to anyone, but I would be sure to make note about the noise from the event space/cafe as I could see some guests not being happy about that."

The night of our stay, there was a very loud wedding/reception occurring, which kept us awake most of the night. Not only was the music super loud late into the night, we also felt uncomfortable with a large group of people gathering during a pandemic in the same building as us. I wish that we had been notified in advance that there was going to be a loud gathering while we were there. If I had known, I would not have made the reservation."

Stayed a few nights","Super stylish and chic place in the center of town. Filled with light, comfortable couch/bay window seat is great for people watching. The bed was also easy to sleep in. A few things to be aware of: The wifi really doesn't work. My computer/phone continuously were being disconnected, and when I used the TV for Netflix, it really wasn't worth trying because it kept freezing/buffering. The other thing is that this place is on the main road, which is a plus because it's so close to everything (The 505 Cafe below is super cute and has great food!) but it also means that it's quite noisy during the day. Would stay again w/earplugs and during a weekend when I knew I wouldn't need wifi."

The smaller room facing the street does have traffic noise at night but I’d still come back just to vacation next time. Also, I’d check out the bigger room in the back.

Morgan’s place was decorated perfectly and matched the cafe below (food and coffee were excellent). It’s a little over an hour from Lake Michigan if you wanted to make a day trip to the beach as well! My only complaint was the WiFi can be hit or miss (not sure if it’s normal or not) but we didn’t go up there to be on our phones/laptop 🙂 We loved loved loved this place!

Stayed a few nights",This was perfect place for us and some grandparents to stay the weekend for our son graduation from CMU. The location’s perfect for any school event for sure. The back yard was great for relaxing by the fire and it was just a short walk to the bars and restaurants to meet the kids. We will definitely look to book again since we have 2 more kids in school there.

We would have loved to have experienced the outside patio in warmer weather, but we did catch some beautiful sunsets.

Holly was very prompt and proactive in her communication. She interrupted her day to come and unpack the fire table and furniture they had packed away for winter due to the weather.
Holly and her husband were thoughtful enough to make a very nice gift bag for my graduate after learning why we were in town.

The host was fantastic, too, always responsive and ready to help with any questions or requests.

It might be good to clear one of the shelves in the bathroom so you can set your bag on. Another suggestion might be to make a small corner vanity in one of the bedrooms with a mirror and stool to get ready at. Overall we were happy with the house and will stay again. I love this house as an option when visiting our daughter. The outdoor area is so nice and relaxing."

We were able to walk right from the house to both Island Park and Nelson Park trails, and also a short walk to downtown shops, restaurants and pubs! We also sat outside in the very private and peaceful back yard overlooking the river and Island Park!
The house was well stocked with most anything you need, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable!
Holly is an amazing host who took care of every little detail and communicated with us very well!

her place is a beautiful place, very peaceful and quiet by the river as indicated.
but i had trouble sleeping with the small bedroom door open as the over head light motion sensor for the small hallway , kept going off and kept me awake all night ! i also could not figure out how to drain the bathtub after a bath, and that was tough.
but i loved all the personal touches she has there, the herbal teas i drank, the reverse osmosis water filter in the kitchen, the beautiful outdoor nature area with bird feeders and being right next to the river was great. when i finally had a few minutes to relax, it was great! i know she will take care of my requests, as Holly and i did communicate a lot before and during my stay and she really cares to make sure her guests are happy!"

Stayed a few nights","My family stayed here for my son's graduation. Hotels prices were spiked so this was a better alternative. I like to write honest opinions. The entrance was a bit awkward you must walk thru a garage then up and down a couple of stairs then to the basement to get in. If you have any problem with stairs you might want to looks elsewhere. The place was clean and spacious. The sitting room was nice with a very large TV. One of the two mattresses was firm and the other could use an update. Please be advised you are sharing the house with the owners. The owners were up early and you could hear them walking around upstairs early in the morning (woke us up). Also check out time is 10am and that came quick after a long night. I asked for a 11 am checkout but was denied. The owners did provide some snacks (water, Skinny Pop) however most were long expired. Overall better than a hotel room."

Stayed a few nights","This place did accommodate four people. It is downstairs and their whole basement. The steps are a little narrow, but we did manage. In the bedroom which there is no pictures to queen size beds, to accommodate four people are there. My husband said the beds were very firm. Madisons husband was very nice and cordial to us as he is preparing for his Christmas lights that they display in their front yard. When we first got there, we were unable to park. This is an a busy street. Madison did supply us with little snacks there is refrigerator microwave, etc. along with dishes and Keurig coffee, which we very much appreciate and we did not use. The bathroom you have to take a step out. If you are over 6 foot tall it might be a little tight in the shower. The shower is very small. The place was very clean which we really appreciate it. We were here for a working weekend.
Unfortunately, I could not always respond to the emails that Madison had sent us because we were working."

It was very cold during the night and we had to use a heated blanket. The only other concern about it is that the shower is very small and not what we were expecting but it was still overall amazing and we loved the experience of it especially since it was only 10 minutes away from the casino where we had a concert we were going to."

Stayed one night",Came into town for a concert at soaring eagle. This place is just a little over 4 miles away and way worth the drive to have more space then a hotel room. Tons of room to hang out and the host had everything from bottle water to smart popcorn and all the toiletries in case you forgot something. If I’m back in town I’m definitely checking to see if this place is available first.

We had a ton of space and our teenager was even impressed by the projector for us to watch movies and TV on. The location was perfect only about 6-10mins away from all the main attractions mt pleasant has to offer. the only trouble we had was the private entrance lock seemed to be malfunctioning when we would use it so it took us up to 5mins sometimes just to get into the entry way. other than that we had a great time.!

Suite has great space and features for the price.
The shower is EXTREMELY small. I’m 6’3” and I could not stand up straight or spread out width-ways without hitting my head on the ceiling or opening the door.
The description can be misleading; it says “whole house: whole guest suite”. It’s the downstairs suite. Upstairs is occupied by the owner."

Stayed a few nights","My folks needed a place to stay in MtP, and this was great for them! They got good nights of sleep, and once the heater activated and warmed up the floor a bit, the temperature was perfect (it was a bit chilly when they arrived, though that owed more to a cold front and it being in the basement - I stayed here once a couple of years back, and I run warm, so it was ideal for me). Easy, 24/7 lockbox access is also great, since they didn't need to carry a key around."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, large private space and a nice kitchen. The house is on a main road but the space is quiet and private once you're inside. No way to get fresh air though.
Mold/mildew almost sent me to the ER. You can almost TASTE it as you walk through the breezeway/entrance/garage.
We brought home bedbugs. I had never seen one before and thought they were hives from the mold- I'm very allergic.
When we got home I went on steroids for the allergic reaction to mold PLUS the itchy bumps were not hives THEY WERE BITES!
I am not a complaining about mere inconveniences, I am telling you that this is a health risk.
Once these issues are remedied it will be perfect.
Facts not opinion.
The reviews are also padded by friends. Just look them up on Facebook. How else does a ""review"" turn into a thread with others defending alleged strangers/hosts?

Stayed one night","Not sure about the Barbara aka ""Karen"" review I had a great stay at this Guest Suite. If you read the description and information on the place it clearly stated ""The bathroom is raised from the floor and therefore has a lower ceiling clearance compared to the rest of the space. "" Yes it is a lower ceiling but im 6ft tall and didn't have any issues taking a shower period. Nor did i see any ""Mold"" everything was very clean throughout the whole space.This is a entire basement and a great space the projector TV was awesome and furniture was comfortable and relaxing. There was even water and snacks provided including a Keurig coffee machine with K cup also provided. As far as ""Karens"" noise problem, you are in a basement so that means there's a floor above you LOL, yes at times you can hear some creaking but again it is clearly stated ""Potential for noise — Minimal noise from upper level"" I personally had zeros issues with anything. I feel the listing was clear and honest and the owners were extremely welcoming and helpful with everything including giving advice about great local restaurants in the area. This is a place id definitely like to stay at again and would highly recommend to anyone else."

Stayed a few nights","I booked this ""guest suite"" for a place to stay for my sisters wedding in town. It was advertised as a private entrance and the reviews were all amazing. I believe these reviews are falsified. I took plenty of pictures but do not see a place to post them.
The entrance was a pathway into the garage that had stacks of trash(literal bagged trash) and other junk that lined the path to another inside door. It smelled horrible and as the days went by the trash stayed,was added too and stunk worse each day. It was advertised as a guest suite but I'd advertise more like a bachelor pad in moms basement.
Once downstairs we found a moldy shower,mold on the ceiling,the metal track,the shower leaking so bad the rugs were soaked. Mold and filth around the sink. I am 5'6 and couldn't extend my arms to wash my hair as the ceiling is so low. The shower was avacado green so straight from the 70s. So my 5'11""son most definitely didn't shower well. We were also left 3 towels and 3 washcloths for a 5 day stay. There was 3 of us. After the 2nd shower i used their washer to wash them myself.
The beds. Again son is 5'11 and was on a twin size leather futon that he hung off of. The master bed was a queen size and when my husband got up a spring popped every time. When i asked for extra bedding because it was cold in the basement she did quickly reply and told me due to covid they had them put up and came downstairs to give me two.
Sleeping was tough. About 5:30am every single morning right above our bed the floor creaked and squeaked. Maybe they were getting ready for work because it lasted a hour ,maybe a little less,and then it was fine. We never heard the dog. I hate leaving a review like this but i really would've never stayed here if I'd seen honest reviews. I took pictures of every single thing i listed. The positive was she replied quickly and seemed nice.
After the 1st night I tried to find a hotel but due to covid they had restricted openings and they said due to the holiday weekend they didn't have anything.

Stayed a few nights","This is definitely a nice place to stay: the hosts go out of their way to provide snacks, entertainment, and even a local guide of things to do in the area. The home theater was wonderful!
However, I wouldn’t necessarily describe it as a hideaway. It’s advertised as an entire private space, which is only partially true. If you really want something private, this might not be the best space for you. The “free parking” is a cramped driveway shared with the several cars of folks who live there as well. You will be able to hear the hosts above you, and worry about them hearing you. If you are socially anxious or sensitive about encroaching on the space of others, I wouldn’t be able to recommend it fully.
It was a bit stressful for that reason, as well as the host’s messaging, which seemed passive-aggressive from the jump (no welcoming message, just a warning to not bring extra guests or drugs into their home, which obviously I had no intention of doing, but it set the stage for a somewhat uncomfortable experience).
Apart from that, we did have a nice kind-of getaway. If none of what I said applies to you personally (i.e. you don’t mind a shared space, or don’t struggle with feeling socially anxious) then I would definitely still recommend the space. However, for myself it definitely diminished my overall ability to unwind and enjoy some time away from home."

There was enough available for entertainment and the apartment was clean and well kept. The hosts were excellent with communication as well.
I highly recommend them!"

It has a completely private living and play space, good for families as well as couples. The entertainment room is wonderful and relaxing. The owners are incredibly nice and leave you to yourself, complete with private check-in and access. The ceilings are low, so bear that in mind if you're 6' or over and a clutz who's prone to bumping your head like me :) Highly recommended for a temporary or longer-term visit to Central Michigan."

Also nice living room area. No TV but they have a big projector set up with nice couches and heated blankets to watch movies.
Double bed was alright but everything was clean and smelled very fresh.
Bathroom was clean!!!! The shower is kind of small and not for big or tall people but it was clean. I'm 6 feet and I struggled in the shower.
Easy parking. Good location if you are in the CMU. Places to eat are close and easy check in.
Would recommend if you need a place to stay in that area."

Arlene was very friendly. We had to be quick to check-in early and head off to a wedding - she even offered to iron clothes for us! She left the lights on for us as we arrived back later in the evening after the reception and a little fun at the casino!
I'm so glad she had a fan in the room because I always forget to bring my own when travelling and I have a hard time falling asleep without one. I would definitely stay here again if I need a place to stay in the area!"

Ensuring that I had enough coffee and juice, to sharing home baked cookies. Location, location, location.. It was just right for me while I was attending family functions.. I enjoyed the peace of the country, and had a place to hike near by. The private entrance and private bathroom were spoiling. I felt safe and welcomed at Arlene's place."

We liked being able to enter our room directly off the front porch, which gave us privacy and made transferring our belongings much easier.

Our kids (4 and 7) absolutely loved having their own space and “kid cave” in the upstairs loft. The backyard and front patio are perfect for enjoying the outdoors. We were able to grill out and have a bonfire which was such a nice touch. We initially had the wrong door code to get in but Morgan responded immediately to assist us which was greatly appreciated. It was very nice knowing she was so responsive! Would highly recommend!

Stayed with kids","Communication - was terrific. The host communicated prior to arrival, upon arrival, prior to check-out, and after check-out. If there was anything that might be needed, we felt assured it would be taken of.
House - was exactly as described. It has been renovated throughout with beautiful flooring, contrasting color, coordinated décor, comfortable bedding and towels and several gathering/talking spaces and sleeping quarters that makes family/friends travel easy and enjoyable.
Location - close to downtown and Mt. Pleasant. We chose this location because we had activities planned in near-by Mt. Pleasant, which was about 15 minutes south.
Amenities - fully stocked essentials. The bathrooms were equipped with Marriott-like shampoo, conditioner and shower gel dispensers on the wall. The kitchen supplies included cleaning products, dishwasher soap/liquid, and marshmallow forks and ingredients to make Smores at the backyard firepit (wood included)."

Joseph and Brenda were excellent hosts and very friendly. They had plenty of recommendations and have lots of experience using Airbnb's themselves. The accommodations are HUGE, with a wide-open feel. It is in a basement, but the floors are nicely painted and there are some rugs.
Everything was super clean and welcoming. We took advantage of the theater area, the gym and the sauna...I even had room to get in a decent walk inside after my workout. The bed was very comfortable, and there was an assortment of pillows, so you're bound to find one or two you like.
This was a GEM of a find, and we will definitely stay there again. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is because I want to be sure it's available whenever we want to come to town!
Book it, you won't be unhappy!"
