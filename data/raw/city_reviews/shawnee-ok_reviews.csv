Stayed one night","It is listed as a cabin, but it is more of a guesthouse. It's across a little deck from the owner's home. She has some dogs that sometimes are outside. They are small, and we didn't hear them barking. This guesthouse is beautifully designed and decorated. I loved all the little touches in the entire home that evoked water, lakes, and oceans. Even the silverware! I also appreciated how many towels there were! So many places only have two for two people, but I like to use two just for myself. They were also high quality towels. They really thought about all the little touches to make this home inviting and relaxing. The window in the bedroom looks right over the water and was lovely in the morning. Jo was also so kind and accommodating when we booked at the last minute. We were driving home from a vacation and didn't want to stay at a hotel; this was so much better!"

Stayed with kids","Jeri was responsive and assisted every step from booking to check-out time. I was there for a softball tournament and was going to cut it close for checkout due to game times. Jeri was flexible and understanding about it. From personal messages left at the home for us to some popcorn left out as a treat, I rate our experience there a 10/10. I will look at this place when traveling to this area again."

We had access to everything as they described! They made sure to have breakfast items out every day as well! They are definitely people you want to stay with whenever you need an air bnb in this area! We absolutely loved the attention to detail, from the WiFi password being framed sitting on a desk in our bedroom to the basket of miscellaneous items on the back of the toilet like makeup removers, face masks etc. it’s really those little things that make such a huge impression especially when traveling or needing somewhere to stay. I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat! Even if it’s just to get out of my own house 😜"

We had our two children with us and they made sure to tell us the staircase is not child proof. We stayed with Wanda and Tyrone last year and we had a great experience then as well. Wanda and Tyrone greater us as we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed as we got settled in. Wanda put a lamp in the bathroom for us as the light in the bathroom went out but let us know and provided a solution which was wonderful! Anytime we stay in Shawnee, we try to stay with Wanda and Tyrone as they are wonderful hosts and we recommend them to anyone who is looking to stay in the area."

Stayed a few nights","There are some AirBnb places that are adequate, get the job done for you, and you don't think twice about it. Then you have places that you'll forever remember as one of the best experiences you've ever had. I have been to a few that were absolutely memorable and I thought there's nothing that could top these places.
Just when I thought I knew what the best AirBnb experience was, then there was Wanda & Tyrone with this listing. This was by far the best experience I've ever had, which also includes listings where I've rented out an entire home!
Not only were Wanda & Tyrone accommodating in every way, but chatting with them was an absolute pleasure! Very friendly and definitely proactive in communication. Outside of my bedroom door needing a good push to open, I believe I found my go-to spot next time I visit Shawnee, OK.
Anything you could possibly think of, from providing heaters to toiletries and cosmetics, this listing is an absolute bargain!"

They even upgraded our room at no extra cost which was very generous. We had a great time hanging out with Tyrone and hearing his stories. Also his chex mix was excellent. The room was clean and orderly as was the rest of the house. Open use of kitchen was extremely useful and they had everything you could ever need as far as cooking utensils. They also have a gorgeous dining room that definitely stood out to me. This is the best place to stay in Shawnee by far. If we had any questions or any concern they were always very responsive. If you need somewhere to stay in town this is definitely the place. Wanda and Tyrone are good Christian individuals who go above and beyond to make sure your stay is pleasant and comforting. I can’t brag enough on them and their home and we will definitely recommend them to others."

I was a little nervous about my young teen and I being able to relax while staying in someone else's home. But, I can't say enough nice things about Wanda and Tyrone. They absolutely went out of their way to make us feel at home and constantly encouraged full use of the house. They were never in the way but always available to meet our needs. The house is super clean and quiet. Their hospitality is absolutely exceptional!! Their home is warm, comfortable and cozy and we were very at ease there! Mrs. Wanda's homemade scones and Caramel Apple Bread were a big bonus too! I highly recommend staying with this super sweet family! We will definitely be back."

Stayed one night","This is one of those places that you'll question what you did right to deserve such an experience. Wanda and Tyrone's house is a marvel, gorgeous hardwood floors, and winding staircase. It is so classic and spotless as well. Being an airbnb host myself at one time, I always love to see how and what other hosts do for their guests. The attention to detail here is phenomenal. Lovely, high end shampoos, conditioners, all natural body wash, plenty of fluffy, clean towels and wash cloths laid out, coffee, teas, orange juice, beautiful cups and bowls set out with breakfast goodies, fresh fruit, (I even got some to take for the road). Wanda and Tyrone have hosted exchange students and others for many, many, years, and they truly know how to do it right. I'm hoping that it works out for me to stay again, this time with my husband, on our way back through in June. This house, and it's people :) are gems!"

Stayed one night","A friend and I stayed with Wanda & Tyrone the first night of a 1,500 mile trip. This was our first Airbnb so we didn't really know what to expect. Before booking the private room I sent a message to the host regarding check in time. This was because I knew we would be coming in very early in the morning. Wanda said anytime before 2am worked for them. This was perfect for us as we checked in at 1:45am! Wanda & Tyrone gave us a tour of the kitchen, our room, and our bathroom. The bedroom had a full size bed and a twin. There were fresh towels and extra blankets for us along with a hair dryer, lotion, and other body products. In the morning we were left breakfast items (coffee, bagels, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and yogurt). We could not have had a better first Airbnb experience! Thank you again Wanda & Tyrone for a wonderful stay in your beautiful home!"

Stayed one night","Gosh, I didn't want to leave. This is a magnetic family.
What delightful people and what a delightful home in tranquil Shawnee. I could live here. Wanda mentioned the house was older but it doesn't look old, it doesn't feel old; it feels perfectly nice. They have clearly done many upgrades.
In my room I went barefoot, which is the Hawaiian way, and there was not a speck of dust or dirt anywhere. She told me she wipes down the floor after every guest. Personally, I do not feel comfortable staying anywhere that is not clean, and Dr. Wanda gets the gold star. Everything needed was provided. They let me open the windows too, because I enjoy fresh air.
Wanda and Tyrone are expert hosts. They have had a variety of visitors in their welcoming home for years from all over the world. They have kind of seen it all, and like the daughter they mentioned, they have a world view helping them to accommodate. They truly know how to make you feel comfortable. I loved everything about their place and I especially enjoyed our conversations. Tyrone and Wanda are educated erudite people who can pursue a train of thought into it's depths with discrimination and perception. I appreciated and enjoyed their observations.
I think we are all here in this world to learn, to grow, and to help others. They almost treat their Airbnb like a ministry in exemplifying this ideal. They said, live your life without fear and well, that is advice I can accept."

I came to Shawnee to see where my parents met and check out my Dad's alma mater. Turns out my dad went to school with Tyrone! Tyrone pulled out yearbooks for me to see and found my dad in his yearbooks. What a trip! It made my visit so special. I would definitely stay with them again if I'm ever passing through that way!

Stayed a few nights",Very rarely do I take the time to write a review but this time deserves an exception to that policy. Tyrone and Wanda are beautiful hosts. I can't say enough about how welcome they made me feel. It was like spending the weekend with relatives. It would be very easy to return for no other reason than to visit with them both... The bedrooms were immaculate and detail oriented of course... the whole house was the same way! The beds were comfortable and I got a good nights sleep both nights despite a bad back and travel anxiety! I will definitely be staying here each time I am in the area...

Stayed with a pet","Unfortunately, not what we expected!
It made me nervous to have the entrance gate open 24/7!
There’s no garage to park your car in, so your car is pretty much exposed to getting stolen at night.
The place is located on a busy road (it was really busy when we stayed) and is not too safe to let your dogs run around.We got there around 10:30 p.m., and none of the house lights were on, so unless you carry a flashlight, you'll not be able to see your surroundings.
Be aware that you won’t have any privacy.
The place was clean though.
Owner replied to my texts right away, kuddos for that.
It has all the amenities.
We cleaned the house before we left and followed the owners’ rules.
We cleaned up after our dogs.
I’ve been using AirBnB for over 3 years, and this is the first time we had to leave early, which is sad, but our safety comes first.
I guess this place is not for everybody."

The house was immaculate and had a nice design to it. I love that there was a guest book on the counter that we could look at and write our own little tidbit in. Tv had lots of sign in options (don’t forget to sign out!) and we were able to watch a little bit of one of our favorite shows one night. It was just the parent getaway we needed for a couple of nights! Thanks again for hosting us!

There is so much space outside. My dog had so much room to run around it was amazing. Really if I wanted to pick one thing it would have to be located on such a busy road but when inside you do not hear it and when outside the road it 70 yards away. Really not that big of a deal. Also First night I even Doordashed Taco Bell so it is not all that far out. Perfect location to drive into the big city, or check out Rt 66. I recomend this place to anyone."

Although possibly not available at all in that area, my only suggestion would be to provide for recycling.

The house is perfectly equipped, any little thing I could think of was easy to find (coffee, fresh trash bags, detergent, etc). The furniture is super comfy, the kitchen is lovely and modern, and the water pressure/hot water was great too. Wi-Fi was plenty fast. Bedrooms are spacious and spaced apart enough you don’t hear each other snoring.
Dinner - plenty of great restaurants about 10 minutes away. We cooked out one night on the provided Blackstone (you need to request it in advance). We had a great time playing cornhole (and plenty of other games in the bedroom closet too!).
Kent was a great communicator and so nice.

We had everything we could have needed and loved feeling like we were in a log cabin tucked away from the busy life. We will certainly use this property again if we ever get back to Oklahoma.

We booked last minute and everything was still ready for us. We had an amazing weekend and felt comfortable inside the cabin. It’s private but not secluded. Close to the highway and easy to find. Communication with the host was quick and direct. We hope to visit the cabin again. Great memories were made!

Stayed with kids","Erica and Jeremy were amazing hosts. The place is even better than the pictures it is large enough that with 8 people there we all had more than enough space. The area was beautiful and the neighborhood was peaceful. It was my parents first time staying at an air Bnb and they were blown away. I've stayed at several before and this was by far my absolute favorite. Shawnee was close enough to all the areas we were visiting and they left a lovely recommendation of things to do in town. With extended family in okc and Seminole we will definitely be staying here anytime we are on town. The place itself was even better than the pictures, and I adored the hosts personality and sense of humor in their guest book. This place was more than 5/5 it was a 10/5"

We were able to make home cooked meals for our kids while traveling. The kids absolutely loved how fast the Internet was & we were thankful the basement bedroom was so big so they could hang out together down there.

We loved being able to plug in our Rivian R1S overnight in the provided Level 2 charger so we could wake up with a full battery. Our 10 month old loved crawling around and our two yellow labs loved exploring the property! We all slept very comfortably! The washer/dryer is silent and brand new - a godsend on a cross country drive with a little one. We had a phenomenal stay! Thank you!

Stayed with a pet","We travel regularly through Oklahoma and often need an overnight stop near OKC. We needed a place that would allow us to bring our pets and were particularly hoping to find somewhere that we could also charge our EV truck overnight. Austin's barndominium popped up in the Airbnb search and was perfect! The unit itself was very spacious with a huge living room, well-outfitted kitchen, and a beautiful bedroom. The rural location meant that we were free from the noises of traffic and the city. The hosts were available and helpful, but not too close! Initially, the EV charger didn't work with our vehicle, but Austin rode over and quickly got it working; we left the next morning with a full charge.
It was easy to find; the instructions for how to get in were clear and easy to follow. There were a lot of amenities including a barbeque grill and outdoor seating area overlooking a lovely pond. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

It was a gorgeous modern barn house with comfy couches, beds and massive TVS with WiFi. The sinks were beautiful and the shower was gorgeous. Check in was so easy, getting there was hassle free and so simple, and the area was AMAZING. The massive pond was so beautiful to look at even at night time, and it was peaceful and secluded. The hosts were incredibly kind and helpful and flexible, we felt right at home here. My stay was beyond perfect, my kids loved it and finally, for the first time in years we were actually able to rest and relax while traveling and didn’t dread the hotel stay instead were SO EXCITED to get there. I would 100% recommend but also not too much so I can book them again😂 all jokes aside this house is perf"

Stayed with a pet","We are a senior couple traveling with two granddaughters and two small dogs. I’m not sure what we expected in a “barndominium”, but we were a bit disappointed. The living area is quite small. It definitely looks like a barn from the outside. The interior decor is rustic and pretty, with country charm. A coffee pot and K-pods were provided, but there were no snacks or bottled water. Everything is new, and they actually hadn’t finished construction of the inside. The king size bed was comfortable, but the pull down bed was firm. The entire yard is covered in sticker burrs, which we had to pick out of the dogs’ paws every time they went outside. The nearby pond is nice, but we didn’t have time to explore that. We were only there overnight. This place would be best suited as a couple’s retreat to the country."

It was also my birthday that day and the hosts graciously allowed myself an early check in so that I could prepare for our special day. On top of that, they had “happy birthday” and “congratulations” ballon’s at our welcome as well as cookie treats and a bottle of champagne. So awesome! They went well above and beyond! Not only all of that but the place was spacious, clean and peaceful and relaxing just what my wife and I wanted for the holiday weekend. We got to meet Austin and his wife as they invited us to feed the catfish at the pond and plant a new feeder with them. We’re in awe of them as hosts and will be back again soon!"

Stayed one night","This was a particularly challenging search for a location. I'm a touring musician, and had been asked to do a live stream show as a promotion for a later concert on this tour. I needed a place sufficiently private that I would disturb nobody, but with a modem that was both directly accessible so I could connect a hard line Cat 5/6 cable, and that also had sufficient bandwidth for the live stream. Austin's listing mentioned high-speed connectivity @ 100 mpbs, so I contacted her to see if the modem were directly accessible. She indicated that it was, and that the location was private so noise would bother nobody. All was exactly as she had said - the main room was perfect for setting up the stream, I connected to the modem with the Cat 6 cable, set up my lights and cameras and mics, and the live stream worked without a problem. For being on the road, this was an EXCELLENT find. Thank you so much!! (Plus the bathroom was WAY cool, and the bed very comfy indeed!!)"

The only thing I’m upset about is that I booked this while traveling and could ONLY stay 1 night! I wish I could have stayed for a week!
This place is a sparkling gem.
And OMG the most comfortable firm mattress I’ve ever laid on. I slept SO great.
Couches we’re comfortable too.
The kitchen was fully stoked w what I needed. Full size fridge. This place is absolutely hands down 1 of the best places I’ve stayed at, and that’s not even including the great value.
Hosts were communicative and kind.
Outside was great - had my morning coffee while walking barefoot outside around the pond. Such a peaceful setting. Very private yet very convenient to the interstate.
10/10 would recommended hands down!
Enjoy your stay!"

The shower needs to be repaired, the electrical needs to be labeled to figured out where all the light switches go. If you can look pass those thing this is a great place . The host was great. We needed a ironing board they brought one over. The host lives next door so you feel secure leaving your stuff their."

The mornings were beautiful outside as we sat out there and drank coffee which was included with their amenities. Pet friendly is a definite plus!
They were super sweet and went out of their way to provide us with all that we needed to get the grill going. My honey loves to grill and cook so we were very appreciative that we were able to cook our own meals.
We highly recommend Austin’s place, you will be very comfortable!"

And from the inside everything was updated beautifully with still being able to keep the integrity of a farm feel, clean , high ceilings, spacious TV has everything you need, card games at the table, open fresh spaces outside of nature right in your back yard! Oh and host were responsive almost immediately to accommodate, very attentive. Totally recommend this place hopefully we have the opportunity to stay again soon. Thank you!"

The pond is fun, it is filled with catfish and a few bass and others, but hooking up with a catfish or two was pretty simple. Great time for the kids! Austin even offered that I can take a few and filet them! I passed, too much work for me, but I appreciate the offer.
The place is decorated very nicely and comfortably. The bed is comfy and the pillows are hotel quality. My wife loved this place so much and what else can you say? It's adorable!
Only 30 minutes from Oklahoma City, we found this to be a gem on our AirBnB road trip across the country. We stayed in numerous places, and this stay has the distinction of being our favorite stay on the entire trip! Thanks Austin, and thank your wife as well. We appreciate your hospitality!

And that's just the inside! A beautiful deck wraps around two sides for enjoying the pond and wildlife. A very well maintained trail winds around the pond, easy enough for kids, and there's another longer trail as well. We saw turtles, a heron, and heard an owl hooting.
Matt has worked hard to anticipate the needs of his guests, and gave us great instructions for arrival.
There's a reason why he has such a high rating--it is well deserved!"

The proximity to OKC is unbeatable - less than an hour drive, and yet the location feels as though you have traveled to a much more secluded area. The woods surrounding the property envelope the house (with plenty of walking/biking trails), and the pond is just serene for gazing/fishing/paddling. The house is minimalistic in the best way - very comfortable and clean with lots of natural light, and stocked with what is needed to enjoy the stay. We really like it here, and appreciate having an outdoorsy place that’s quick and easy to travel to!"

Stayed a few nights","We are so glad we chose to stay here, even at last minute. Unlike some lake resorts in Oklahoma, this location is close to everything you need in the city of Shawnee, and less than an hour from Oklahoma City. Initially we chose the proximity to family and friends joining us over what we thought was more ideal and more affordable, but upon leaving we mostly talked about how soon we could come back! The element of seclusion made us feel cozy, and with young kids, happier to let them run wild. The pond is serene and beautiful, from the cabin and the trails. We loved pulling little perch and 3 lb bass from the water, before smooching and returning them. The amenities allowed us to have an elaborate birthday dinner and cook everything with ease! The back deck flat top grill and air fryer are so awesome! Breakfast on the back deck with coffee, enough yard for adult and kids games, and escape from the heat for movies and naps…. We had just an incredible R&R vacation here!"

My wife, daughter, one of her teammates, and I LOVED the place! I’ve stayed in a handful of short term rentals and this was the best! The place was VERY clean, the kitchen was spotless, and the furniture was comfortable. Bedtime was without issue and no complaints about water pressure or temperature. Game day breakfast was easy with almost everything we needed to cook (I didn’t find measuring cups but I could eyeball it). Matt was kind enough to let us have our team hang out after the games. The girls fished with worms we got from Walmart and they had a blast catching sunfish and crappie (bring your own gear). They explored the trails a bit but spent more time fishing and playing ping pong. We’re already planning a trip back! Also, ask Matt about his baseball bat making parties!"

The blackstone was wonderful, we cooked every meal on it. The kitchen was stunning and had everything we needed! We saw so many interesting bugs, snakes, turtles and were definitely visited by the local raccoon. The ticks were kind of bad around the back of the lake and in the forested area so beware of that.

We had already been dealing with no electric for days so I looked for a rental in shawnee and Matt and Katie's place popped up..It's really hard to get into a property same day..but Matt immediately responded back ..eager to help us out ..to our surprise their property was directly across the road..it was perfect ..I never even knew this place existed ..it's hidden secluded , private and beautiful..we enjoyed fishing ..sitting out by the fire ..the house was so comfortable and set up perfectly ..beds were amazing..easy instructions ..check in and check out we're a breeze..I would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for a place to get away and relax!!"

There is so much to do and everything on the property is in good shape - we kayaked, fished (and caught a fair amount), hiked around the pond and beautiful property, played ping pong, basketball, and more during our annual trip. The cabin was super clean, well stocked for cooking, and close to Shawnee for groceries and restaurants. 10/10 would stay here again"

Stayed a few nights","Matt and Katie's place is phenomenal. it is spacious, clean, the grounds are beautiful and quiet, while still being about 5 minutes from town. There is an outbuilding with a basketball hoop and ping pong table, hiking and biking trails right out of the door, and an enormous deck with lots of seating. Matt and Katie have thought of everything. We have stayed at many airbnbs, and I honestly think this is the best one ever. What stood out most to us was feeling immediately like we were more than guests. This felt like staying at our best friends house. They made everything you could possibly need available. It really was just like staying at a beautiful and clean version of our own home. I can't recommend this stay enough, and applaud what Matt and Katie have done to make this a remarkable place to stay. THANK YOU!!"

It was so peaceful so beautiful so calming so relaxing everything was perfect! Plenty of supplies we needed nothing except our own food. We finished and actually caught six! We walked around the 20 acres on the hiking trails which was so beautiful. Next time I come back I will definitely be here. Plenty of room for everyone when they came to visit us and there was the game shop the kids had a ball in! Thank you so much we had a blast!

Stayed with kids","This place is a gem. The property is situated in a way that truly does cause one to feel way more secluded than you actually are - surrounded by mature oak trees, and wrapped with a densely wooded area that has well-cut trails for walking, running, or biking. The crowning jewel of the property is the spring-fed pond. In the calm waters of both the morning and evening, the reflection of the tree line on the water is something majestic. I realize my words may sound a bit over-dramatized, BUT this place was exactly what I’d hoped it would be based on the description/photos. We wanted an easy getaway where we could unplug and connect with nature and with each other. My husband and 4 year old son fished their hearts out from both the shoreline and row boat, while baby sis and I relaxed in the ample shade provided by the tall trees. We took several family hikes through the woods. I would give this place a 5-star review for the exterior alone, but it’s worth mentioning that the inside of the house was very clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything needed for an enjoyable stay. And you can still enjoy great views of the pond from most every room inside! We hope to be able to return semi-regularly, since it is only an hour drive from OKC. What a great spot to “retreat” for a long weekend! Loved it!"

Stayed with kids","Our family stayed here over Father's Day weekend and had a blast. It was the perfect place to unwind from our chaotic lives raising 4 small kiddos. We enjoyed the trails, fishing, kayaking, and playing basketball and ping-pong in the shop. The only time we left the property was on our first night just to buy groceries.
The kitchen was large and well-stocked with all of the cookware/utensils you need, and the nice large Blackstone griddle on the deck was awesome to make our meals on.
The bedrooms were spacious, had huge closets, and great beds.
A bonus with the time of year we stayed (mid-June): the *hundreds* of ripe blackberries waiting to be picked behind the shop! Our kids had a lot of fun picking them, and my wife made an awesome blackberry cobbler.
We also loved that it wasn't far from home (OKC metro), but felt very private/secluded. Definitely recommend staying!"

Shawnee can be hit or miss, but the lake area is wonderful! The view is beautiful & location is peaceful. The host was communicative from the get-go. We made a bonfire which was super fun, enjoyed the large patio in the morning & had enough space for all of us to sleep, hang out & get ready comfortably. One thing I noticed that I often find missing at other airbnbs - they had all the amenities & plenty extra if needed like toilet paper, towels, dishes. I highly recommend booking this lakehouse if you’re visiting the Shawnee area!"

The adults relaxed by the shoreline, kayaked, fished, read books, and enjoyed the sunrise and beautiful weather on the porch facing the lake.

They have truly thought of everything and I could tell that they will bend over backwards to make sure that anybody staying in their home is comfortable. If I ever need to stay in Shawnee again I’d definitely stay with them!

Stayed a few nights","This was only my second time staying at an airbnb, and my first time to be in a bedroom in the hosts' home. I'm happy to say that my initial slight apprehension was eased upon arrival! Wanda and Tyrone are welcoming, professional hosts and were very accommodating of our late arrival. They are quite conscious of social distancing, and their home is sparkling clean! The queen bed and pillows were very comfortable, the bath across the hall was nicely stocked with toiletries we might have forgotten, and the light breakfasts were beautifully presented and delicious. Wanda was a pleasure to visit with, providing interesting insights about Shawnee; additionally, she promptly responded to each of my messages. I would definitely stay at this home again...Wanda and Tyrone's many years' experience as hosts is quite evident!"

Stayed about a week","I needed a place, for a week, to stay in between various surrounding business meetings and this was just the spot! Easy to find, easy access to main roads and restaurants (Try the Italian place right down the road !) Wanda greeted me with a smile when I arrived and quickly gave instructions on how to securely come and go. Tyrone and Wanda's home is welcoming, super clean and would be a fantastic spot to stop for any occassion. All amenities are clearly marked for guests, rooms are spacious, beds are comfortable, they even had a ""sound machine"" in my room which was great for me and my much needed fan noise. 👍They offer a light breakfast assortment as well as coffee and bottled water. I was able to do light laundry, get the work done in my room with provided internet all while sitting at a very nice sized corner desk. They are truly kind people with a lovely home and willing to help with any needs you have. This will definitely be a place I utilize again and again."

Stayed a few nights","First off, Wanda and Tyrone were very welcoming, and a wonderful couple and hosts! Their house is very spacious, so Wanda met me upon arrival and gave me the tour, and showed me the room where we'd be staying. The house itself has a lot of charm, and is kept very clean. The room was clean and as described in the photos with a comfortable bed, cool A/C, and Wanda even had a carafe of water waiting in the room for us. There was another guest staying in the house at the same time we were, but only ran into him twice. Each time, he was very cordial. The location of house is very central, and we found it very easy to get around town. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to travelers coming through Shawnee. Lovely home, and lovely hosts. Would stay here again. Thanks!"

The room was comfortable and clean, as well as the rest of the house. The house was large enough to host many guests without really even bumping into one another. Everything was wonderful and when/if we come back to Shawnee we will definitely try to get a room with then again."

Stayed a few nights","It's no wonder Wanda & Tyrone are Superhosts, they epitomize the definition. The home itself if just perfect. It's spotless and perfectly furnished. The kitchen has everything you need plus a lovely corner with a daily food surprises. There was homemade banana bread on one day, another day some delicious fresh fruit. The location is perfect and the rooms are so comfy. This was my first time renting a room instead of entire home. I was concerned about privacy and feeling uncomfortable around others. This fear subsided within minutes of entering the home. The door code is customized to each guest, so you come and go as needed. If you are up to small chat or no chat, Wanda and Tyrone no there place as a Superhost. They are two of the warmest people I've met. I can't speak highly enough about this home."

I didn't get to stay for long, but they were super great hosts, Tyrone meeting me upon arrival, and Wanda meeting me upon my departure in the morning. They also had coffee and breakfast items that guests could help themselves to. Highly recommended place to stay if you're in the area."

Their house is very nice and clean, and they offer a lot of amenities to their guests. There were a few other guests staying while I was there and they were all very friendly to talk to. I would definitely stay again."
