Stayed a few nights","Matthew is home was a really good place to stay for a short period of time. Easy check-in good view clean. I’ve stayed in this apartment complex before it’s pretty small. All the bathrooms are very small so it’s not just his unit, the bedroom was very nice, the only complaint I have, which is very minor is that the sheets that are on the bed kept sliding off I would suggest to get new sheets that go for the depth of the mattress because I think they’re two that are stacked on top of each other. there is no induction stove, the other unit I stayed in this complex had one and it was honestly super convenient. But again it’s pretty worth it to stay here for the price that we paid very clean fairly quiet. The walls are thin in this complex so I would keep that in mind that people can hear you vice versa."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our time at Matthew's place. It is conveniently located w/ easy access to slopes. Bus stop is a solid 8-10 min walk in either direction (uphill on the way back) so we opted to drive to free parking lot instead to save some time. As described, the place is small but had everything we needed - except for closets/ places to hang wet ski gear, as others have mentioned. There was an issue with the sinks draining slowly, but hopefully that's resolved for future guests. All in all, a solid, convenient home base to play in the snow :)"

Stayed about a week","The apartment is exactly as advertised and is perfect for a 1-2 folks skiing at steamboat - the view is also not oversold at night it’s beautiful! That being said communication for issues will not be great as it’s clear its an automated service and not host responding.
1 example - I asked for early checkin. I got a message less than 1 minute later telling me they couldn’t guarantee it but would check with their cleaning service (clearly automated) and if it was cleaned already I could checkin early. I didn’t get another message from them and couldn’t check in early. When I got to apartment there was a notecard that clearly stated the apartment had been cleaned and was ready from cleaning service an entire day earlier. So they clearly never even looked into it.
Small things. But for a barebones getaway it’s great for the price. The free coffee offered was also nice. Just don’t expect any service while at the apt."

Stayed a few nights","Such a fantastic cozy nest in Steamboat Springs! Minutes from everything from ski resort to downtown to Strawberry Hot Springs to Fish Creek Falls!
Had everything we needed and the fridge and the microwave were great for leftovers. Bed was super comfortable and the decorations were cute and fit right in for the charming mountain-town vibe!
The stairs closest to the actual unit were closed down for construction but there was plenty of parking on bottom or top level!
10/10 would stay again- great value for the time we were there!"

Stayed a few nights","Small space, but that was expected. Really wish they had provided some space for clothing. No dressers, no closet, not even hooks to hang up wet towels. (There was one dresser in the bedroom but it was full of extra sheets and towels.) A shelf in the bathroom would have been nice. Loud construction next door and out back made it difficult to enjoy coffee on the patio or sleep. Easy 10 min walk to free shuttle was nice."

Stayed a few nights","The location of this property is great, but it could use some serious TLC. The condo was dirty upon arrival (dusty and food on the floor). The pictures in the listing are old as everything inside is very beat up (furniture/walls). The kitchen sink had food in it and the bathroom sink would not drain properly. We also had dirty linens. Also beware of the construction for exterior structural issues that are ongoing if you missed in the listing. Mathew is a very communicative host but this property needs work."

Stayed a few nights","The location was absolutely gorgeous, tucked in the hills with a fantastic sunrise and sunset! The neighborhood was safe, peaceful and the drivers were very aware of the pedestrians - Which was great because we walked to a neighborhood Bistro for dinner one night! The space itself was smaller than we thought but it was extremely clean AND it had everything we needed. It was described perfectly so we knew there wasn't an oven or a full fridge, etc. but it was enough for what we needed. No surprises. The bed was super comfortable and the linens felt fresh and lovely after our long days of hiking in the nearby areas. The town of Steamboat Springs is a wonderful place filled with shopping and delicious food AND it was easy to navigate. We felt like we lived there after only four short days. A fantastic location, a fantastic experience and a great host!"

Stayed a few nights",Post very accurately describes this cozy nook. In order to enjoy Steamboat you do need a car. I would suggest brining a knife and cutting board (and a can opener) if you intend on utilizing the kitchen as there isn’t one provided. However kitchen is very clean and functional for its size. Parking is easy and we throughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks!

Waking up here was a dream. The only issue we experienced was that the blinds on the front window were broken and stuck in the down position, so we didn’t get to enjoy the view as much as we would have if they were able to go up. It was a really sweet spot though! Thanks Matthew"

Stayed one night","The professional photos on listing hide the true condition.
In reality, the windows are moldy from constant condensation. The shower is also moldy.
Multiple areas are damaged - the towel hanger on bathroom door had been ripped off leaving a hole in the door. There was also a cabinet door falling off the bedroom dresser. Several baseboards with hunks missing.
The place needs some maintenance if the pictures are going to show a pristine condo."

We appreciated the Netflix on the TV, the tea selection, and the blankets on the couch after a long day of skiing! The views from the top floor are spectacular, and it's just a short drive to the hill. There are quiet hours for the building which keeps things very calm, but you may wish to bring earplugs in case a neighbour comes home late."

The location is walkable to Steamboat's downtown attractions which allowed us to enjoy the Yampa River views on our way to coffee, meals, and more.
Trudy was an exceptional host, allowing us to settle right in. Her home is intentionally set up with cookware, linens, games, etc. Trudy's care for the property and her guests were evident.
If you are looking for a relaxing corner of Steamboat, look no further. :)

The bunnies bounding through the snow in the morning while you drink your coffee. Each room has its own solar patterns. Sitting comfortable in the south facing sun, in the living room in the morning, and hanging at the dinner table, playing cards, with western sunshine during the evening. The night time walks along the river are practically right out the front door. The details inside the house reflect the thoughtfulness of the owner. Trudy makes you feel like a guest and an old friend. We won’t stay anywhere else when we come to Steamboat!"

Make sure you understand parking location and plow days as these weren’t listed in the binder and we had a little mix up. Overall a great place to stay, was very warm for cold winter snowy days!"

Just a minutes walk into downtown, yet so quiet and peaceful you feel like you’re out in the ranch lands. Secondly, this is such a unique experience! This little house was once a mining cabin and you can see how it has evolved over the years into the quirky, quaint gem that it is. Trudy met us personally to let us in and explain all the nuances of the home. There is no AC, but we were there during a heat wave and had no issues as the home is quite shaded and we left the windows open at night and closed during the day and we’re completely comfortable. I will definitely be crossing my fingers that this little house is available on our next trip to Steamboat!"

Trudy was very helpful and responsive. And the value for the place was pretty great, the most affordable option I found by far. My only complaint is that we were a little cold on our first night, it got down to 15 degrees outside and it seemed like the house was having a hard time heating up. I also found the bed and pillows to be too firm and a little uncomfortable, so if we stayed again I’d just bring our own pillows maybe. But with that said I would still absolutely recommend this place, we had a great stay overall."

We skied 3 feet of fresh powder during the day, had fast wifi when we had to work, and had a great time exploring the downtown restaurants and Strawberry hot springs.
Trudy was an excellent communicator, providing directions and check-in instructions, and met us at the house to explain the heaters when we arrived. It is an older house so some rooms are warmer than others, but we were plenty toasty even when it was in the negative temps outside.
We ended up driving to the mountain (again, negative temps) but there's also a shuttle from town that seemed quite easy. Steamboat is amazing, I can't wait to return!"

The house was extremely clean and well organized. The “crooked” nature of an older home was comforting. I especially enjoyed the outdoor seating area for reading and coffee in the morning. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was large enough for more than one person to work.
An added benefit was that this house is close to the public library which gives temporary library cards to visitors of Steamboat. It is also very close to entrance to the core trail.
I would absolutely consider returning here during another summer visit."

Stayed about a week","What a very special cabin in an amazing location. If you appreciate staying in a little piece of history and don’t mind the small quirks that can come with that, then you will absolutely love this place. It would be advisable to be under 6’ to optimize your comfort level, as the ceilings are quite low in the bedroom. We did not rent a car and everything was accessible to us, as long as you don’t mind a beautiful walk to any location you might want to visit, including tons of restaurants, shopping , skiing. Howelsen ski area is an amazing centerpiece of Old Town Steamboat and a fun skiing experience with the added bonus of Ski Free Sunday’s during ski season. If you want to experience Steamboat’s big ski area, it is a short Free bus ride away with a bus stop just down the hill from the cabin. The CORE river trail runs along the Yampa River, also just down the hill, and makes everything easily accessible if you like to walk and take in the beauty Steamboat offers.
Trudy is absolutely the type of host we love…personable, easy to reach, so accommodating and helpful. Quite a gem! The kitchen is well stocked with anything you might need. The house stayed cozy even in 0 degree weather. Also, the bath towels are worth a mention, wonderfully luxurious.
If what you are looking for a resort style experience in Steamboat Springs, this is definitely not going be a good fit. If you appreciate experiencing the true feel of being in an historic western Colorado mountain town, then you will find it here."

Trudy was very helpful and responsive. Great water pressure in the shower. Firm bed. No a.c., but plenty of fans and being in the mountains, the nights cool off. We live in Denver and just recently discovered Steamboat and live it. We visited in mid-July and the wild flowers were great. We just just finished visiting in September and enjoyed fall colors.. Really enjoyed the Steamboat botanical gardens, Fish Creek Falls hike and Lake Dumont and Rabbit Ears Pass. We went to Wynonas for breakfast and lunch and enjoyed both."

Trudy takes pride in her beautiful yard which we enjoyed in the mornings with our coffee and in the evenings for happy hour! This place is a gem tucked away in between large trees yet close to downtown Steamboat! Thanks for sharing your great place, Trudy! We look forward to coming back!"

Stayed about a week","The Crooked House is a very special house in a great location. If you like luxury, level floors, or need a place close to Steamboat Ski area this is not the place for you. If you like authentic, rustic, charming spaces this IS the house for you! It is easy walking distance to downtown, Howelsen Hill, and Colorado Mountain College. This house is cozy and quiet - there is a home run daycare close by so you can hear the children playing outside in the afternoons which is delightful. We were there in winter and a gas fireplace, some baseboard heating, and a couple of space heaters kept the house plenty warm. There are also lots of cozy blankets and fluffy towels to help you feel extra comfy. Very nice shower with plenty of hot water. All of the kitchen appliances, utensils, pots/pans, dishes, etc. you need. Nice laundry room with washer and dyer (soap and dryer sheets included) which is very convenient. The ceilings are low so if you are much taller than 6' you might feel a little cramped.
The host, Trudy, left us some homemade soup and other snacks in the fridge - so nice! Trudy knows SB well so can provide local tips. We really love this little house and hope to stay there on all of our visits to SB!"

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend! The location is perfect, nearby downtown Steamboat Springs, Strawberry Hot Springs, and hiking. There’s grocery stores and restaurants nearby as well. The condo was extremely clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Super easy check in and out with the key code on the door and clear instructions from the host. There’s a hot tub right outside the sliding doors, it was super convenient to walk out the back doors and relax in the hot tub at the end of the day. The kitchen had all the kitchenware we needed to cook (pots/pans, dishes, spatula, baking sheet, wine opener, mixing bowls, strainer, etc), cable tv in the living room (the couch has comfy recliners), Wi-Fi, washer and dryer, bathroom was stocked with anything we’d need during our stay (towels, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, hair dryer, etc), keurig for coffee. We slept well and enjoyed our stay! I appreciated the guide from the host with instructions on how to work the appliances and local recommendations."

Stayed a few nights","The condo is a very reasonable 1bed/1bath place to crash while visiting Steamboat. It is a convenient location outside of town on the south side (for a summer stay). The unit is a bit dated, but reasonably appointed with all of the basics. Sam and Courtney were very responsive, and their directions/instructions were very clear and easy to understand. One of the units near to us was going through some repairs or remodeling during our stay, which is obviously outside of Sam and Courtney's control, but it did lessen our ability to enjoy the unit somewhat. No AC, which isn't unusual for the mountains, but it was pretty warm in the evenings."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, a convenient location for a ski trip and Courtney and Sam were great hosts and responsive to our messages. We appreciated the coffee in the mornings, the fireplace, & the cozy bed.
A few things were a bit different than we expected. The condo, while renovated, is a bit older, and located on the lowest level (a sort of half-basement space). For anyone out there with a sensitive sense of smell, there were a few things that bothered me a little, but the hosts offered to let us burn a candle to help with the odors.
There was about 5 feet of snow everywhere in Steamboat, so we couldn’t really access the hot tub from the back porch and had to walk a longer way around. Also the hot tub in the photo is the hot tub located near a different condo building closer to the entrance (the one out back is much older, has some cracks and is uncovered).
The melting snow created a lot of ice covering the majority of the parking lot, so be sure to wear appropriate foot-ware for getting around!"

It was as if we were expected to clean after our visit when housekeepers clearly are paid to do so. The blankets on the bed were not clean, as there was clearly stains of bodily fluid, crusty bits, whatever you’d like to call that…..The towels smelled like mildew and were not completely dry. The dishes in the cabinets were not clean. Other than that, it was fine I suppose."

A Safeway is about a half mile away (a convenience store is a little closer) and there's a sidewalk to it, but the best feature of this listing to me, by far, is the bus system in Steamboat Springs. Park your car and use the bus, which runs every 20 minutes to downtown. There's a bus stop adjacent to the complex. Everyone uses it and it's free. My compliments to the town on this system. I'm probably an oddity but I love public transit and this is a great system. You don't need to pay a premium to be closer to town unless you're above riding a bus."

Loved the gas fireplace, big TV and cable services - perfect for apres ski and storm days. The furniture is nice and the bed is super-comfortable! The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and eat our meals in. Plenty of paper and cleaning products, extra towels, blankets, pillows, etc. Lots of storage space for skis and gear. This is a classic high-occupancy ski condo in a high-density complex - Sam and Courtney have added lots of little touches to make it as nice as possible. Unfortunately, the hot tub was closed for maintenance while we were there, but that is beyond their control. Easy check in and good communication with hosts."

Stayed a few nights","The place is cozy located about 4 miles from Steamboat Springs ski resort and 25 miles from Hayden airport. A car is needed to reach the ski resort. Yellow line bus was not running. The kitchen was well equipped to cook my own meals. Microwave is on top of the fridge which made it difficult to use. The bathroom was clean and nice. All bathroom supplies were included. The bedroom sleeps two. The king bed was firm and uncomfortable. The pillows were clean but uncomfortable. You can hear the upstairs neighbors and next door neighbors. There are many clocks in the condo. The heater worked to keep the place warm. The furniture and rugs felt dated. TV has Netflix and Hulu. The view outside the balcony is beautiful.
The items I feel need attention. The refrigerator makes loud knocking noises. Check in instructions were not provided by 4pm. The microwave is too high to use conveniently."

Stayed a few nights","This a beautifully decorated apartment with great access to downtown Steamboat and local trails. The hosts went to great lengths to include anything you might need for your stay. The only challenge is there is no AC and the unit gets all the afternoon sun. Fans were provided but they are very loud. The unit lighting is all very soft, which feels dark since the shades stay closed because of the sun. It is also the case that every corner is filled so you either move things around or live out of your suitcase. We like to have a few empty drawers when we travel and no luck with this unit. These are very picky comments. Please know that we enjoyed our stay. But if you like a bright, spacious unit with room to sit outside in the afternoon, this may not be your choice."

Large walk in shower with great water pressure.
The location was perfect for us, close enough to Lincoln Ave to walk but far enough off to get away from car traffic. Dedicated parking on site. The condo property is really easy to find and check in was a breeze.
Great communication from the owners who also provide all the information you need via email as well as hard copies on site. A great location and value. We will definitely stay there again."

The condo is a little walk from town, uphill on way back, but totally doable in great weather.

Stayed a few nights",We loved Kelly and Clyde’s beautiful condo. Everything from the decor to the furniture was very well thought out. I myself am a sucker for interior design and this was by far the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in regards to that. You could really see the attention to detail they put into the place and the thought that went into everything. We absolutely loved it and felt like we could full unplug and rewind. The sofa was extremely welcoming and we loved coming back to it each day to relax after adventuring around all day. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook delicious meals in. The best part was that we were able to eat most our meals in and not feel like we were missing out on the atmosphere of a nice restaurant. We truly loved everything about the Dreamboat condo and we are already talking about staying again come summer.

We found the walk enjoyable especially after our dinners in town. We didn't use the bus system for skiing as we found it easier to drive to the free parking. The parking on site was easy and close proximity to Kelly's place. Her condo has great views and we were able to catch the sunset one night. The walls can be thin but we didn't have a problem with noise as it appears that the neighbors are respectful. If you want to be inspired for design choices definitely stay here, every detail is perfection. Kelly is a great host, very quick with responses."

Not just that, but it was also comfortable AND overly stocked with more amenities than I am used to in an AirBNB. We caught rainbow trout and only had to buy a bit of fresh produce and voila, dinner was served! The bed was top notch, and my one complaint about most of my stays is lack of pillows, but Kelly and Clyde had like a billion and we were in heaven. Pull out couch was comfy for our son. Entry was super easy, and communication friendly and thorough. It’s absolutely on our list to stay again. I’ve stayed in a lot of places, and this is by far the best stay we’ve ever had."

The kitchen was well stocked with gear and spices, which allowed us to use the kitchen as if we were back home. The bed and couch were comfy, so much so that we didn't have to pull out the sofa bed.

Stayed a few nights","was skeptical about staying in a teepee. the pictures and reviews were excellent. pre-arrival communication was fantastic. when I arrived S took me all around the property and showed me the how’s and when’s. it was daytime and hot outside and i was still skeptical. then when it grew dark, all my skepticism vanished. i could have stayed in a cookie cutter condo in town. been there done that. i laid on the bed (on top of the heated mattress pad) and gazed at the stars through the opening at the top of the tent. amazing. then, nature called and i stepped out to use the restroom inside the houses (steps away). when i came back out, i was blown away by the stars. billions of them (it seemed). i could have started a fire in the pit already ready to go 10 feet from the teepee. instead i sat on one of the many supplied chairs and star gazed. got a bit cold and went inside and the teepee was just so comfortable. (heater and fan supplied). stay here. you will be very happy."

Staying in a teepee allows you to sleep under the stars and in the fresh mountain air while being protected from the elements. Their teepee is located just next to their home and the home is tucked away at the top of a hill just on the outskirts of Steamboat Springs. Despite being next door to their home, the teepee provides privacy and quiet. This location gives one access to all the town has to offer as well as to the local hiking, biking trails, and hot springs. This was a perfect summer Airbnb for Colorado!"

Stayed a few nights","What an adventure! I left my contacts in so I could look up at the stars through the opening in the top of the tepee. If you're worried about being cold, there is an electric mattress pad that warms you up from below the sheets! (Pro Tip - these things are pressure sensitive. If you crank it up to 8 or 9 and spread the pillows around on the bed before leaving for dinner, when you return the bed will be roasty-toasty warm when you climb in. Just be sure to turn it back down to 2-3 or you'll wake up sweating!)"

Stayed a few nights","You can expect a really unique experience, staying in a large teepee that crosses feels like camping but nicer. The fire pit outside added to the atmosphere, and we were lucky enough to see fireworks on 7/3 that made our stay even more astounding.
David and Sadie likewise are very entertaining and never at a loss for words. Easy going and friendly, they made our stay feel very comfortable and personable."

The view to the mountains is great and situated in the quiet part of town just makes it a perfect spot.

We can recommend this to anyone.

The options to share the inside kitchen and bathroom with Dave and Sandie was a great perk. The location/price of this spot is amazing. We hiked the Spring Creek trail leaving right from thier hillside. Downtown was an easy walk or bike ride and there was so much to do in the area. I feel in love with Steamboat Springs on this trip. Trails not to miss = Mad Creek and Uranium (if Fish Creek Falls is too crowded). Taco Cabo, Mountain tap brewery and Yampa Valley Kitchen were great. Sandie knows everything so can help with all kinds of referrals!! xoxox We will be back."

The tipi itself is an experience unlike any other. The decor makes it so cozy and with a heated mattress/room heater, we managed to be nice and toasty in the 25 degree weather and snow! Sandie invited us to go to a local event downtown with them, but we already had plans on going to the hot springs (which is right up the street from the tipi location!) Although we didn't go with them because of our other plans, we really appreciated the invite. Additionally, the bathroom was nice and clean with a heated floor and Fresh coffee was ready to be brewed in the kitchen when we woke up! We would stay here again in a heart beat!
P.S. our car battery died in the middle of the night but thankfully Sandie and David responded to our texts quickly even though they weren't home at the moment to help us out. We got our car jumped and went home! Such caring people!"

While the teepee is in their backyard and in a residential neighborhood, the teepee, itself, looks out over nothing, but beautiful scenery. Sandie met us, welcomed us, and oriented us to their space (since guests have their own bathroom in the main house) and to the teepee (where guests sleep outside under the stars). We drove up to the hot springs after dinner, which was really nice (bring a flashlight!) and thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay in Steamboat."

We not only enjoyed the teepee which is beyond awesome but we enjoyed them even more. They provided us with great things to do around town and were BEYOND accommodating with us. They went over and beyond! If you are looking for a unique location and great people stay here. You wont be disappointed!

Super cool to sleep in a tipi, it rained during the night which was an amazing experience. At the top around pols is an open area to see the stars at night."

Dave and Sandie are great hosts, have excellent communication and provided us with helpful local tips of where to eat and visit for our stay - they even offered coupons and spoiled us with delicious coffee in the teepee. We loved spending time hanging out on the back deck overlooking downtown with beautiful views. Stay here if you want the inside scoop and a memorable stay in a really cool teepee."

The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed, though we ventured out to dinner most evenings (highly recommend burgers at Back Door Grill or a nice date night at Besame!). We did not use the hot tub as we spent most of our days on the go, however, the hot tubs looked very inviting and were less than a minute away. We highly recommend Carri's place and will look to stay here again!"

Because it’s the top floor, it was quite warm at first, but the A/C unit in the bathroom cools down the space quickly.

Heleen and her husband made us feel so welcome! I am not usually a private room renter, but I would 100% stay here again. While we did not wind up going to the hot springs they did provide extra towels and a head lamp for the springs, which was super nice. Oh and their dog is so sweet. Great, sweet interesting people to chat with as well if you feel like it. Thank you for the great stay, it elevated our trip."

Heleen was very accomodating and welcoming. During our short stay we enjoyed our conversations. Also important to note that the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is nicely updated and extremely clean. We sometimes hesitate about staying in a shared space via airbnb. In this case, our experience was far better than if we had the whole place to ourselves. Thank you!"

Heleen is the most wonderful host/hostess! Both she and her so very adorably cute sidekick Quasi, (her dog) made the stay so relaxing and perfect!
Quasi is my friend forever! I wanted to bring Quasi home with me!
Heleen and Quasi made the stay perfect!
This is the place to stay in Steamboat Springs!
Thanks Heleen and Quasi!

Stayed a few nights","I've experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly with AirBnb. This stay most definitely qualifies as good. Heleen was a very friendly and helpful host and the room with private bath was spotless. I was sure the bathroom had just been completed the week before my stay; it had that brand new look. The location was great; part of a charming, quiet, old residential area of Steamboat and within walking distance of the main street of town. I would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay in Steamboat. Walkable to downtown. Very comfortable room and space, great shower, lovely back patio for coffee in the morning. Heleen was very welcoming and accommodated any requests. We also loved Quasi, the resident dog :) We were in town for the Run Rabbit Run 100 mile event. Thanks for a great stay! It was perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","The space is cozy, clean, spacious and overall just lovely. The bed is big and comfortable. It’s quiet, the bathroom has a new fixtures with lots of space and a nice big new shower. The place is a 10 minute walk to the middle of downtown or a three minute bicycle or skateboard ride. Heleen is a wonderful host. Very kind and fun to talk to. She also has a sweet little doggie. Highly recommend!"

On top we stayed in this charming cozy and very clean home ❤ Heleen the host made us feel like home and was very helpful in giving us some ideas what to do around the area .

Stayed a few nights","Never having rented a room in a person's house, this was a first for us. It has opened the door to a new way of travel as our host was kind and welcoming! She was easy to communicate with, and everything was exactly as she'd told us (location, instructions for getting in--including her dog, etc.). We'd highly recommend staying with Heleen."
