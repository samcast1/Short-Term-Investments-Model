Stayed with kids","Tyler's place was a good fit for the two of us and 2 year old grandson. We liked the studio. There was lots of light while still feeling private. The fold out couch was comfortable for me, I slept sort of corner to corner and avoided the dreaded fold in the mattress.
The kitchen counter is wide and easy to work at, and it was simple to use the big sink in the bathroom. The neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant for a orning walk before we headed out. The fireplace heater was a little finicky to turn on, and kept the studio very comfortable in the night."

Stayed with a pet","Tyler was a great host. The instructions were clear. The place was as described and very homey. It is in a quiet part of town and has a little yard if you have a small furry friend.
I got into town a little early and asked if I could check-in. They quickly replied and said that everything was ready, which I appreciated after three days of driving across the country.
Enjoyed my stay and would stay again."

Stayed one night","Convenient, quiet, a comfortable bed with lots of pillows. Checks all the boxes for my road trip. Oh, and nice shower.
No kitchen, which didn’t bother me bc I am not the type of Airbnb guest to cook. He offers a single burner setup.
Tyler made several recommendations for local places such as restaurants.
I liked “Koreana” restaurant very much, which was not on his list. Yet.
The people I met in Winnemucca were quite friendly and helpful."

There are a number of stairs inside up to the bathroom (and kitchen sink which is also the bathroom sink) to be aware of. A nice coffee machine was a plus. We had a great stay!

It was really nice to just be able to land, make myself some soup and hot cocoa, and get good sleep before continuing my journey. Way better than any hotel/motel.
I did need to air out the smell from whatever cleaners or air freshener, but I’m sensitive and that was still wayyy better than a tobacco smoke filled casino/hotel or motel which is the common for Nevada.
Highly recommend!"

Our favorite part was the outdoor area. I should note that we were told that we couldn’t check in until 6pm because no one had cleaned the space yet. It was not a problem for us because we booked this as a stop on our road trip so we were getting there late any way. However, I though I should still mention it for other travelers. Long story short, responsive host, safe area, and clean and space!"

There is no sink in the kitchen which I missed when looking at the picture. There’s a large sink in the bathroom with a dish drying rack on the counter. It was a little inconvenient but the yard and dog friendliness made up for that. The smart tv was awesome for movie night as I didn’t have to login to any of my subscriptions. Tyler was very responsive when I reached out. I would definitely stay here again.

Felt safe, clean, and glad that it took animals being not so many places on that stretch of highway. Choose this location because we had a tow behind trailer and didn't want to worry in the city over night about it. Great quick overnight! Thanks"

Stayed with a pet","Overall it was a very comfortable apartment for our 4 nights. The bedding was soft and great level of warmth for this time of year - the mattress was perfect! Kitchen had just enough of everything & the water filter was appreciated! Loved the front patio.
Tyler was very responsive throughout our booking & stay.
I was surprised by another dog in the back yard (his) when we first let our dogs out. Although knowing it was a shared yard, I didn't consider there would be other dogs - just good to know. Tyler responded to my concerns immediately.
I didn't find the firefighter's access to be as described. It's not completely separate as it's a shared entry with the apartment's door to the backyard. To be able to use the dog door the kitchen door needs to be open - which opens to the shared basement entry. Wasn't an issue, but didn't use the dog door because of it. Our stay was great but would have appreciated some clarity on the above aspects before booking.
Thank you Tyler"

If you have a choice to stay anywhere in Winnemucca you should stay at Warren’s just to be at a peaceful place, listen to his stories about the ranch as well as his life experiences. I was thinking what to write in this review but when one thinks of travel one thinks of a place to stay but it is so much more. To meet Warren enriches your travel experience. His story about being on a World Champion mining team is fabulous. I wanted to take Warren’s dog (Potatoo) home with me. What a cool dog. He’ll walk with you down to see the Texas Longhorn cattle that Warren has on his ranch. His generosity allowing you to use anything and everything in the kitchen as well as having your own fridge for your personal items is so nice. Finally, if you play foosball against Warren in the home you better bring your A Game. Even with a 50% lead that he’ll give you he’ll still end up winning! 5 Stars to you Warren and your place!"

Stayed one night","Warren and Emily were friendly and welcoming. They were very relaxed and easygoing. I enjoyed chatting with them and getting to know them a bit. Their dog, Potata, was very sweet too (once I got the seal of approval—that is, once my hosts got home, a couple of hours after I arrived, and Potata could confirm that I wasn't an intruder!) 😝
Warren & Emily live on a ranch and it was fun to ride my bike around and explore it a little. Their place is casual and comfortable. If you're used to staying at the Ritz, you may not find it suitable, but if you're as relaxed as the hosts are, you'll fit in just fine and enjoy yourself!"

Stayed one night","We had a great time staying with Warren and Emily for the annular eclipse! We had no idea what to expect, as we have never done an ‘in home’ airbnb before. It was terrific!! As another poster said, it was like visiting a friend’s house. We had plenty of privacy in our bed/bath area, a pot of hot coffee was ready for us in the morning, and we had loads of fun conversation with our hosts. If you stay here, pay attention to the ‘under the freeway’ directions (maybe preview the route before you go so you know what that means) and for sure walk around on their beautiful ranch property and meet Iron Maiden! Thanks to Warren and Emily for a fabulous stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The home was very easy to find, just up the road from city hall. The home is older (guessing 1940's) with basement (that's where the laundry is). The master bedroom has a large tv on the wall. Master bath is all original. The second bathroom is as well original (we wouldn't use the shower if you paid us). Kitchen was 90% original. Oven worked, but stunk and was slow to cook. Train track (and Amtrak station) is a block away. Yes, you can hear the train but you can hear it all over town. Found really odd was that there was no smoke detector anywhere in the house. Definitely needs to be added for safety. Good place to for a night or two."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for two nights while our son was participating in a Boy Scout event nearby. Originally were going to be a foursome but the other couple backed out last minute. Less than 500 feet from the Martin (fabulous Basque restaurant) and less than 1000 feet from the Amtrak station. Several trains did run through town at night but it was not that noisy, the house is well insulated. Even if the interior to some guests might appear to be dated it’s like stepping back in time to an old relative’s home. Everything was there that we needed and everything worked. Walking distance to downtown bars, casinos, restaurants, and the supermarket (although that was easier by car). Even if you didn’t whoops and holler it up with a party and music two couples could really enjoy the time there. Very cozy and comfortable, it was just right for a winter getaway."

Stayed a few nights","What a great gem! Lots of living space in the dining room, living room, spacious kitchen and a card table in the open sparse basement. Outside was a whole yard that would be great for a gathering (although they do not allow gatherings). I was surprised to find no outdoor grill, but nothing was mentioned in the description about a grill. There is even a third bedroom in the basement - not described in the listing. That worked out perfect for us.
The neighborhood seemed safe, but there is security and video cameras in the driveway. We had a lot of expensive equipment with us, so I appreciated it, although the alarm was annoying as it loudly announced every time you opened any outside door.
I had wanted to host a dinner party, but there is a rule against that. The place is big enough - with lots of space outside. But I do understand not wanting to let renters throw a big party. I did not ask if I could - I just stuck with the house rules.
Overall, this was better than described."

It looked like some areas of the house have missed a few deep cleans; mainly the shower and kitchen sink and the front window sills (pet hair). For a house advertised as “No pets” I sure saw a lot of pet hair on the couches and recliners and stuck to my clothes. If you’re allergic, take note of this.
Otherwise a very cute home and was a better choice for us than a hotel."

The bed was comfortable and we so appreciated the snacks and water. The home is walking distance to many restaurants and downtown. This is the place to stay if you plan to stop over in Winnemucca overnight on a long road trip. We will be gladly staying here on our way back from Utah."

Another thing is it had the best amenities of any place we've been. There were extra toiletries, bandaids, fans, blankets, humidifier, pretty much everything and anything they had supplied it for us. We definitely plan on staying here the next time we are through Winnemucca. Thanks again Susan for everything!"

This trip was perfect, and Susan’s friendly and welcoming pad was a huge help and comfort to travel down a memory lane of sorts. Thank you to the entire town of Winnemucca, so warm and inviting.

Stayed one night","We drove up from Reno to see the annular eclipse and wanted to spend the night after an early morning and a long day of taking photos, and Susan's place was a perfect place to relax. I love the way the place was decorated, it felt more like a boutique hotel, than someone's home, or regular hotel. A huge bonus was a little arcade machine in the living room, I played Galaga for a bit before taking a nap. :)
Susan was super responsive and even accommodated a slightly earlier check-in, which was much appreciated, because we desperately needed a nap. The house was easy to find, it was on a quiet street, filled with beautiful trees in their Fall colors. There were snacks in the kitchen, the beds were super comfy, and the pillows were SO comfy - which is rare!
We had a car, but the neighborhood is totally walkable and just a few blocks away is a bowling alley and a few restaurants. We had never been to Winnemuca before but we definitely want to go back and would love to stay here. :)"

Stayed a few nights","Susan's Quaint Cottage is a nice 2 bedroom 1 bath house on a quiet residential street in Winnemucca just a short walk from the small downtown area. I stayed two nights on a road trip through the area, and the house was pleasant and spacious for a short stay. The kitchen has full-sized appliances (and Susan provided snacks!), the bathroom looked as though it had been recently remodeled, and the WiFi was fast during the day.
Susan's AirBnb is a good alternative to the casino hotels in Winnemucca. I would stay here again if I pass through this area of Nevada."

Great location, a beautiful cozy cottage with a vintage vibe that made me feel right at home. The backyard was a highlight, plenty of seating to sit and enjoy an usually cool Nevada night. The trees made it feel private and was a little oasis of calm after a long drive. Enough about the backyard though! The home itself was stellar! Well stocked and had a few pleasant surprises. I can't remember the last time a hotel was as well put together and you cant beat the price to space ratio! I've only stayed at a few AirBnbs but Susans cottage will be hard to top in regard to both hospitality and the home itself."

Lots of little details for things we needed, like tape, matches, extra blankets, an extra toothbrush which of course one of us forgot; kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, from dishes, utensils and pans, to spices. peaceful little backyard with clean, well-working grill and patio furniture. Beds were very comfy though a little softer than I usually like, but that’s so subjective. Quiet neighborhood, even though there’s train tracks not too far away. Susan went out of her way to make our stay special. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!"

We got in after 1:00 am and had to be ready to leave early the next day for a funeral 45 minutes away. Our stay was short, but the house was fantastic. I just wish we could have stayed longer. I did accidentally break one of the shower curtain hooks. I spoke with Susan and offered to pay for it. She said it was okay, they expect little things like that to happen. I appreciated an understanding host, but am still willing to replace it.

Stayed one night","We spent one night at Susan's on a super hot day (100+ degrees F). The posting said there was AC, and there was a box unit in the kitchen. But, as someone who is not typically hot, on this very hot day, I was uncomfortable in Susan's house. The box unit could not keep up with the extreme heat. My partner and I decided to sleep in different beds to try to stay cool, windows wide open. A very loud and startling train woke me up in the middle of the night. Overall, while we found Susan's place to be comfortable, spacious and affordable, we probably would opt for a hotel if staying in the area during a heatwave in July. Susan was super communicative prior to our check in and we appreciated the snacks and waters she left for us. It was, unfortunately, just too hot to enjoy it - and, we found the post about AC misleading."

The place is spacious and wonderful with the amenities provided. We especially liked the corkpin map showing where the other guests hailed from. A note to light-sensitive sleepers: one of the bedrooms faces an apartment building with a bright light that is on all night. It didn't keep us awake, though, as the bed was comfy and each of the rooms has its own heat/ac unit. :)"

Warren was very nice during our small interaction. The bed was comfortable and the room/bathroom was clean.

Traveling with 2 teenagers and our 3 dogs can be a bit of a hassel, as well as costly, but here we found the perfect soot. The kids had a room and so did we. And our pets were welcomed. Unfortunately, we didnt get to explore the property like we had wanted, due to such a short trip, but we are looking forward to hopefully retruning one day. It takes an amazing person to open their hime to compmete strangers and to do so like they are old friends. Because thats how he treats you. Traveling can be as overwhelming as it is enjoyable, but having a welcoming and comfortable place to stay makes it that much better. Its like a home away from home."

Stayed with a pet","First off, let me say that Warren and his young son are a delight. Watching them interact was a great reminder that there is a lot of good left in this world and reason to be hopeful for the future.
When considering a stay at Warren's place, I would encourage you to think of it more along the lines of a close friend who invites you to stop off at his place on your way through town; instead of a traditional Bed and Breakfast setup where the host caters to your every need. Warren's a hard-working father who is extremely busy trying to keep food on the table and spend some quality time with his son. The guest wing of the house is very well-kept and prepared for your stay, but the living and kitchen areas you pass through on the way to the guest rooms are clearly the domain of Warren and his boy. Going in the front door, you're greeted by a collection of work clothes (big and small), a kitchen with well-used appliances and a multitude of toys scattered under the big-screen T.V. Warren invites you to make free use of the living and kitchen areas, but you need to understand this is his home, not a resort.
The guest wing is off the side of the living area and includes a full bath and two bedrooms with comfortable king-size beds. There's a sofa in one room and a glider in the other for additional sitting options. The bath includes plenty of clean towels and other necessities (just be patient while waiting for the hot water to arrive, it will get there). You can cook in the kitchen and watch T.V. in the living room. The T.V. has a good selection of streaming services (Netflicks, Prime, etc.). Warren and his son often move into the private wing of the house to allow guests time in the common areas. Overall, the house is comfortable and fully functional.
The location is about five miles west of Winnemucca just north of I-80. The house sits about 400 yards off the road and overlooks a high-desert valley to the north and imposing mountains in the distance. You have to weave your way through some equipment and machinery parts on your way to the house, and you'll likely be greeted by Warren working on a tractor or truck in front of the shop as you drive in. He just waves and tells you, ""The house is open."" In front of the house is more evidence that a young boy lives here and his father is too busy to worry about making the place look pretty. For that, you'll need to walk down the hill.
Just north of the house is a lane leading down the hill to a wonderful collection of old corrals, outbuildings and a grassy area set up for picnics and group events. The corrals house several long-horn cattle and off the side of the parking area is a great sand hill where the kids can play with trucks and other toys generously left by Warren's son. My dog loved stalking the pigeons perched around the corral, and the adjacent fields provide a perfect place for both dogs and people to stretch their legs. It's in this area that you get a true feel for the ranch.
For anyone looking for a place out of town and away from the casino/restaurant areas in Winnemucca, Warren's place is perfect. It's quiet and the views of the mountains and desert from the two guest rooms are spectacular. You just have to understand that this is his home and a working ranch. Also, Warren's old dog moves freely in and out of the house, so keep your dogs on a leash or they're likely to follow the ranch dog through the pet doors and take off to explore."

I didn’t eat all day and he shared his food with me. His son is cute and social. Place is very clean and quiet. I didn’t get the chance to see the rest of the land bc I had to leave early in the morning.

The house is at a large ranch with beautiful Mountain Views all around. The rooms are very comfortable, and there’s a foosball machine. We had really nice conversations with Warren too.
Highly recommend for folks who are passing by. You’ll have a wonderful impression of Nevada."

The apple map app stops giving directions at a certain point but the direction given by the host in the check-in portion of airbnb covered the gap of instructions. We arrived very late and had to drive around a lot of equipment and spare parts that would have been easier to see during the day. We realize this is a working ranch not a Hollywood ranch and are unbothered. It is an excellent value. We had enough parking for a uhaul and SUV. Door was unlocked and we were greeted by a kind sleepy older dog and followed the check-in directions to our rooms or we might not have been able to find them. We went straight to bed which were clean and comfortable. We found the towels folded and stacked under the sink but decided not to use the shower and get going. Didn’t use the wifi even though it was available. Host was easy to contact.

Warren and his young son were kind, accommodating, and friendly. It's a working ranch, not the Ritz hotel, but he is clear about that in the description, and the room and bathroom were clean and quiet. Lots of beautiful views of the mountains around the property. My dog got along fine with their sweet dog Tomata. I would stay there again if I was in the area, and would recommend them to anyone traveling through on a budget and looking for a different type of experience!"

Our room and the bathroom was super clean and we got a great nights sleep (super quiet, comfy bed). Great value for money!
The main living area of the house was well 'lived in', just like any other home where a four year old boy is being entertained while at home (during the school holidays).
It was great to share a beer with Warren and hear the story of the farm and the great venue space he has developed down the hill. Go and check it out while you are there.
TIP: if you really want to make Warren happy challenge him to a game of fuzeball... but don't beat him like I did, as he just can't take losing at fuzeball! ;)"

Stayed one night","It was midnight. We followed the GPS until it stopped. There was a ranch there, but the address was wrong. We should have read the reviews entirely then we would have known the GPS gets spotty. We continued down the road looking for the correct address. We drove in someone elses driveway, turned around, and continued down the road. Then, we found it! Haven Ranch. We turned on the dirt driveway and drove until we came to a gate. As a country girl, I knew what to do, and hopped out to open it as husband drove through. I closed the gate and got back in the car. At this point I was feeling excited. We parked in front of the house, and the door was unlocked. I went in. I looked around. I didn't know were to go! I called the number for the host on the app. He answered.
""Warren?"" I asked.
""Yes"" he answered.
""Am I in your house?"" I asked.
""Yes"" he answered.
""Where do I go?"" I asked.
""Go through the kitchen and go left"".
I apologized for waking him and wandered through the kitchen and went left. We chose from two rooms. It was very clean and cool. We slept and left in the morning without meeting Warren. We will hopefully be back!"

Stayed one night","Warren is the real deal--a ""cowboy"" with heart. With Warren it was way more than making money or about business. He's actually offering an ""experience"" and what I love about Airbnb (which seems to me is increasingly harder to find.... lot of people offer you a place to crash and nothing more). Warren opened up his home and made me feel like part of the family. I was traveling by myself and I really appreciated meeting his cousin/friends, too--everyone making me feel comfortable. He's the kind of guy who offers you a beer, burger and laugh. The kind of guy who is curious about the world around him, while also loving his life on the ranch. The whole experience was a breath of fresh air and exactly what I needed. I hope to be back again soon."

I don’t mind the fact that it was in the middle of cow country, with associated aromas. My dog enjoyed sniffing around."

Barbara leaves lots of small treats, like capuccino sachets, coffee, oatmeal sachets, etc!
She’s dog friendly and my dog was welcomed in her place, which was so nice since some people here at Airbnb don’t like dogs :/
Outside the motorhome there’s space to sit down and relax or even a barbecue, for those who likes it :)

All the amenities worked well including wifi. My son loved the games and dvd player. It was a little cold for us to use the firepit but we look forward to returning again and so we can roast hot dogs and sit in swing.
Her directions were spot-on and we found it easily. When i messaged her with questions she responded quickly. She had sets of towels and bathroom items provided so there was nothing we needed to bring. No noisy neighbors and we had plenty of privacy.
It was a lovely visit and we recommend it for anyone traveling through Winnemucca."

The space was bigger than I envisioned. All clean and very cozy. I felt right at home. Having the private yard was nice, and the RV was set back so it was a totally private space. It was a quiet neighborhood and I was able to walk my dogs around no problem (we saw some goats along the way). The bed was very comfortable. It was completely quiet and I slept well. The hot water lasted long enough for a great shower. I would certainly stay here longer. Truly comfortable."

Stayed one night","The place was decent, was just passing through on my way from Oregon to Las Vegas. The gps/map didn't match, so it took me about 1/2 mile away from actual location. Same thing happened for the door dash delivery driver. Here is where it got interesting (I share this to hopefully avoid a bigger situation for future guests) - I had to walk about a 1/2 mile to meet the door dash driver - while walking up the street, I encountered a beautiful brown doberman, that was outside, up the street on left side, and not in a fenced yard (probably weighed about 70-80 pounds) and I was on the opposite side of the street, but it rushed me twice getting within a foot or two, and luckily backed down. Had I gotten bit, which in retrospect seems like a very real possibility, I was 300 miles from civilization and it could have been quite dangerous, had I been bitten."

Stayed with a pet","Great little RV. Clean and private. Ridiculously comfortable bed and an awesome host who provided a light breakfast and a well stocked kitchen. It was a relief to have a place to stop with or dog that was truely dog friendly.
A note on the neighborhood - it is a very standard Nevada neighborhood, with the addition of a goat farm! So my best suggestion to other guests is to not let the rural environment surprise you when you arrive, and it should be common sense not to let your dog off leash, or walk them, close to working properties.
We felt very safe during our entire trip and will absolutely hope to stay again as we do this drive several times a year."

As weary travelers it was wonderful to find this quaint place to relax and enjoy the clean, restful and thoughtfully stocked RV.
Away from the hustle and bustle of town, the area felt safe and peaceful. There was plenty to enjoy as the kitchen was well stocked with morning breakfast and snacks in the refrigerator.
The RV was clean and comfy and spacious enough for a couple to relax and enjoy some evening TV watching or sit outside and light the fire pit during the cool evening.
For us this was a lucky find, one that we hope to enjoy again, as we had a deliciously restful night, the best sleep in a long while.

Stayed with a pet","Barbara and her husband have a really lovely RV in a quiet part of Nevada, but in an area off of 80 that is in dire need of hotels and places to sleep for travelers like me.
This space was clean, stocked, and even had a breakfast bin. My cat and dog liked it. I slept with the windows open and the cool desert air was very soothing. I could have had a little bonfire in the space provided, but I was so tired from driving.
Minor issues: Maps doesn't seem to understand how to get to their house. It wasn't so bad to figure it out, but don't trust G Maps.
Also, walking my dog past the livestock dogs down the road caused all the dogs to bark. Both are out of Barbara's control, of course, but future folks might want to keep these things in mind.
I will definitely see if this place is available again on my roadtrip back.
Careful, don't lose the RV key like I did! 😅"

Stayed one night","The problem I had finding the place was of my own making, as I hadn’t thoroughly read the welcome letter with instructions. Read them! But if you want an authentic experience with lovely people & the sweetest dog imaginable, this is the place!
Also important to read the description fully. They had me at “ranch.” And that it was. Amazing clear, starry night skies, cattle wandering through the yard, jack rabbits surprising us in the multicolored grass. No other units besides ours, which had a comfy bed, lots of space, wee fridge and great setup up for coffee in the morning. What it lacks is a shower (which is noted in the listing), but don’t let that put you off. This is a true find in Winnemucca."

Stayed one night","We loved staying in this suite! I felt very safe with a car packed full of stuff as we stopped during a move. The property is beautiful and we even saw the longhorns way off in the valley. Comparable pricing to the hotels in downtown Winnemucca, but a way better deal. Rent this!"

Stayed one night","This was such a treat. Exactly what I was looking for. Privacy, vistas, sunset, stars and sunrise. The place was clean and I was quite content."

Stayed one night",Comfy little suite. Easy to find and the bed was not as short as other reviews mentioned. My six foot tall husband fit just fine. It was a nice little place to stay while passing through.

Stayed one night","Warren in an excellent and hospitable host who responded quickly and did everything to make us feel comfortable and welcome. The tiny home is a bit smaller than I expected and the one bed shown is also a futon, so the only sleeping accommodations are those. Definitely a “glamping” type place that was conveniently located off the freeway and great for someone driving thru."

Stayed one night","Exactly as described, though the pictures were deceptive (made it look bigger than it was). Unfortunately I was in a rush and didn’t read through everything when I booked it, so was surprised that there was not a bathroom in the unit. Also the insects were a little concerning to me.
If I had been expecting to be roughing it a bit, it would have been fine."

Stayed one night",Beautiful place off the beaten path. Exactly as advertised. Well suited for those of us who arrive fed and seek out firm mattresses in quiet places. Especially enjoyed the bird and coyote songs in the afternoon. Don’t miss nearby Thunder Mountain Monument!

Stayed one night","The tiny house was nicely done up, but the lack of running water was unexpected as there was a sink in the pictures. The description said no WiFi connection and this made it difficult to communicate through AirBnB as instructed. It is peaceful as I really love being out of any city lights, at least until rain hit metal roof so loud I could not sleep. It’s like going camping really."

Stayed one night","Great little place. The sink didn’t work, I guess cause the water would have to be turned off in the winter so the pipes don’t freeze but that wasn’t mentioned in the description. And the railroad tie building bathrooms in the description were actually locked but there was a port a potty nearby instead which was very clean. Clean and quiet little place in a beautiful setting that served its purpose. It was very cold. The building is not well insulated so the little heater just barely kept the frigid chill down but I piled on all the blankets and slept just fine. The bed is actually a futon and the cushion is pretty thin with a hard frame that you can feel supporting it and cold air kind up seeps up from below. It could use a mattress pad both for comfort and warmth. All in all though it was a good stay. I’ll bet in the summertime it would be amazing."

Stayed one night",The surroundings were beautiful and the host was so helpful in printing off my parking pass for me and left it in the room for when I got there! As the other reviews say I would recommend bringing layers/blankets for if your staying in winter months.

Stayed one night","I loved the location and the views from the windows. When I got there it was 16 degrees so the water was off so only the out house for toilet, which was fine with me. There was drinking water in the room for drinking and coffee. It was cold with only one heater in the room so if you are going in the winter I would request another electric heater. Other than that I would go back again. I was lucky to have a full moon."

Stayed one night","Warren was so accommodating and welcoming, as we tried to book one of the rooms in the house at the very last minute, but someone beat us to it as we were exchanging messages with Warren. Warren then mentioned the other option, the bridal suite, which we jumped on as we were tired and needed to stop for the night. The ranch was easy to find, as was the cottage. While it was very cold outside, the space heater warmed the place up pretty quickly and there were extra blankets available for use. The fridge wasn't plugged in, so we kept our food in our cooler which was not a big deal. The short distance to the rustic and really cute bathrooms was quick and easy, and a nice couple who were camping on the property had a fire going in the firepit near the bathrooms, and invited us to join them if we'd like. It was great to wake and look out the window to see Iron Maiden (LOVE the name!) in the field next to us. What a beautiful wedding facility and great place to overnight. Thanks, Warren!"

Stayed with a pet",we drove in late and it was easy to find with his instructions. We woke up to a nice view . private cabin but wish the door had a lock . the futons are very small but we slept great.
