Stayed a few nights","I travel a lot to Greenville, Ohio but this is the first time I stayed at an Airbnb while visiting . I was very happy with my choice, it would have cost me more for a hotel but the accommodations wouldn't have been as nice as they were at this Airbnb. The house was easy to find, the directions to get inside were clear, the apartment was clean; comfortable; and well provisioned. I have no complaints at all. Also, I read the reviews for this Airbnb before I booked the place, and noticed that a few people said the water pressure was low. That was not my experience, the pressure was great, so that issue must have been fixed.
I definately will book this place the next time I come to Greenville, Ohio."

Stayed with kids","Our stay was lovely. My family and I had stayed the past two years there the weekends before Christmas. Even though someone else had the Airbnb previously, Omotolu kept the same comfortable holiday home with some great updates. I also super appreciated the individual travel toothbrushes and toothpastes since I forgot to pack mine while I was packing everyone else’s things. Also, the hand soap is AMAZING! It’s an odd thing to be excited about but I’ve never gone looking for specific hand soap before and this soap has me doing that.
Thank you so much for everything. You’re doing an incredible job! ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean, had plenty of room, and all around quite nice. Except for one thing that was a deal-breaker for me. The bathroom water pressure is pretty much un-useable. Water doesn't come out of the faucet with enough pressure to even wash your hands easily. The shower is like washing under a watering can that you use for your garden. Sure the water comes out, but it is not at any pressure that makes rinsing your hair very easy. I'm a guy with short hair, I can't imagine what it would be like for someone with long hair. I almost messaged and asked about checking out early for a refund. I toughed it out but won't book again."

We would stay there again!"

Stayed with kids",This was quite a ways off the interstate but in a very cute little town. The place had a lot of room. If you want privacy you only get that in the small bathroom though to change for example or if those in the main room wanted to do more than sleep. My son said he couldn’t sit up in bed in the loft. The floors are a bit creaky and I would have liked better water pressure in the shower. The decor was super cute and very stylish. My kids loved having snacks that were provided. I would stay there again.

Group trip","The cabin is very secluded and has plenty to do around the property. The cabin was very clean and has a very nice kitchen and bathroom. We spent a lot of time on the patio and used the fire pit, grill, and patio set. There was an awesome TV that we used each night, and everyone was able to see. Worth noting, the bathroom is the only separate room in the cabin, the rest is very open concept.
A very nice small place to stay in rural Ohio, but not too far from a big city for entertainment."

We are local and decided to do a little getaway since my daughter was out of school for a long weekend.
The place was just what we were looking for. It was beautiful and serene and we can't wait to go back in the summer.
We came at the very worst time...during an unexpected snow storm and I had trouble finding the driveway, but Brittany called me right away for help getting there.
My six year old daughter especially loved her own space in the loft.
Would love to rent the wagons, cabin and saloon in the summer for a family get-together! 😍
Thanks again, Brittany!"

Stayed with a pet","WHAT A GREAT WEEKEND! To celebrate our wedding anniversary my husband sent me this Airbnb and I'm so thankful for the time we got to spend here.
The cabin was so clean and beautiful. The bathroom was stunning and had ample towels/ wash clothes. We LOVED the kitchen. The pond was directly outside the sliding doors and so well kept. Multiple trails winding together directly behind the cabin set the best walking paths with our dogs during the evenings! We would love to return!
The only thing I wish we had understood prior to booking was there are multiple properties on site, all with access to the pond and trials etc. For our stay none of the other properties were occupied so it truly was a amazing secluded and private weekend away. This would be the best place for a reunion or family weekend away!"

We spent time together as a family, built memories, and did it all inside a private enclave of forest nestled in serene Ohio farmland. Hiking, swimming in a private pond, and lounging; if your objective is to unwind and disconnect, this is a must visit destination."

Stayed with kids","What a beautiful location and property! I took my daughter and two of her friends here for a sleepover in the woods. They had a blast. Their favorite parts were the pond and the outdoor stage. I'm glad we were the only guests on property so we didn't have to share the outdoor amenities.
Unfortunately both the dock and the ladder to the loft area were in need of some upkeep. I was also shocked at how much food had been left in the fridge and freezer. There was barely enough room to put popsicles in the freezer. And thankfully no one in my group had food allergies as there were crumbs anywhere there was food storage. Because of this, we left our non-refrigerator food on the countertop and woke up to ants.
Be sure to bring extra towels for the pond and wood for the fire pits."

The cabin was beautifully styled and curated -- it really set the mood for a relaxing vacation that was all about enjoying the nature surrounding us. We all spent as much time as possible enjoying the pond by puttering around on the boats and fishing. All the extra touches (like the oversized hammock, the trampoline, the playground, the tire swing, the misc indoor toys ) were also unexpected but a much appreciated bonus in entertaining the kids.

Stayed with kids","Attention midwesterners-This is a hidden gem. We live in a neighboring midwestern state, and hadn’t considered vacationing so close to home until we stumbled upon this adorable AirBnB cabin in Ohio. My husband and I had two school age kids and our dogs with us, and we all had a great trip. The property is peaceful, secluded and serene, with plenty of activities to do. The cabin is cute and cozy- and had everything we needed. The hosts have literally thought of everything. If you are looking for a fun and relaxing trip, this is a great option. The bonus for us, is that the travel time was less than 2 hours from home, and our dogs were able to join us."

Stayed with kids","If you're looking for a little slice of heaven to take break from your daily grind I would highly recommend this gorgeous cabin! It is situated at the end of a long drive that feels like all your cares leave you as you drive back into the trees.
The pictures don't do this place justice. From the perfectly decorated interior, to having everything you could need for your stay, it doesn't get much better than this.
Outside features a beautiful pond that has a paddle boat, fish, and perfect water for floating. Bring rafts and float your day away in the sun. (My favorite part of the weekend!!) They also had an abundance of fishing gear for your use.
There are walking trails through the woods that my family enjoyed exploring several times a day.
My kids had a blast on all of the tree swings, the playground, trampoline and their faces lit up seeing all of the toys inside.
The beds were super comfortable and everything was considered down to the room darkening roller shades.
Thanks for a great weekend away with my family!"

House is just as it looks in pictures, very nicely furnished and clean. It’s stocked with all of the basics most should need. There is no WiFi or tv, but there are games galore and a beautifully manicured yard to spend your evening in. We played yard games and dominoes while we grilled. There are so many details Michelle has covered to make your stay memorable. It was perfect for our family(3 couples) traveling back home from a graduation on the east coast. Can’t say enough good about Michelle and her wonderful home!"

My son-in-law's suitcase was delayed and the airline left it at our front door, but they photo they took (we were gone at the time) made it look like a different bag. Michelle was kind enough to go over there on a Saturday night and snap a photo for us so we could breathe a little easier. Thank you Michelle for the fresh muffins left for us!
Guests read carefully - there is no WiFi at this location. I didn't notice that before we booked. Totally my fault for not noticing it. Other than that little hiccup / oversight on my part, everything at the property was wonderful."

Private, quiet, comfortable with room for the littles to run off some energy. The property was perfectly landscaped and maintained. We only wish we had more time to stay and relax. We all slept wonderfully in the comfortable beds. We were so happy to get to observe a bunny just outside a bedroom window in the morning for about 15 minutes. I'm from farm country so I didn't mind the smells of nature at all, in fact it was nostalgic. We would absolutely stay here again! Thank you Michelle for allowing us to stay at this beautiful home for the night. Take care!"

Please note the description says it is on a lake and it is not. Do not let this deter you, Kelly & Vladimir were very responsive and this place did the trick as far as needing a nice place to stay in Greenville.

If there were one thing I would suggest to the host for improvement, it would be the beds. I didn't have an issue with the character of the older squeaky bed frames, but the mattresses themselves. Very, very well used. Overall a lovely place to stay and we plan to come back!"

If you love that vaulted ceiling, varnished wood, classic New England ""camp"" look, you will be overjoyed to find it in western Ohio. It's worth renting just to experience the vintage combo appliance in the kitchen. There are other homes around, so it isn't super quiet, but what we mostly heard was a great variety of birds. We didn't take the boats out, but we went out on the dock and saw that they were there (and oars and paddles inside). Susan was a really responsive, accommodating host. All in all, we loved our stay at Camp Combs and can't wait to return!"

I’m from Washington State, and I am not used to warm days and warm nights. The two AC units (one in the bedroom - one in the living room) kept the whole cabin nice and cool. It had the cutest and most interesting all-in-one kitchen unit I have ever seen. There was plenty of towels and had lots of pots, pans, a coffee maker, silverware and utensils - everything I needed. The patio with a fire pit and a picnic table was wonderful. I had two cook-outs while I was there. It was a blast! The public beach is within close walking distance. The owner was right down the way and was so friendly and accommodating. I totally recommend this cottage. You won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed one night","This Cabin had an easy entry policy. I found it very clean, i.e. no mouse turds or anything else. The Cabin is warm on the inside and I found the bed to the left very comfortable. The kitchen was missing the small table to the right, but I think it opened up the space better. The stove/oven/sink combination was a treat to see and use. The light in the kitchen was not initially cooperative, but came on later. Dish soap, toaster, 8"" pan was utilized as was the refrigerator. I did not find the refrigerator too small, but just enough for what was needed. Cooked breakfast on the stove. Made coffee in the maker with no issues. But the bathroom had a towel folded in the shape of a Swan, which I thought was an excellent touch. I did not have the heart to unfold the towel and use it. There was plenty of towels and wash clothes in the bathroom drawers. I recommend this facility and the host/hostess. Had a great time. Lit the candle on the coffee table also."

Enjoyed bon fires both nights, they were very thoughtful and had wood ready sitting on patio... candle and matches in cottage. All the things you would need if cooking, would've enjoyed staying longer, didn't want to leave! No problem with having enough hot water. Plenty of towels and washcloths, some toiletries, everything you need."

The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen is charming and “oh so retro”. The shower provided plenty of hot water for us. We did not use the lake or fire pit. Internet access was spotty in areas but certainly usable. We would have no problem choosing this sweet cottage again.

Stayed a few nights","This cottage is an excellent place to stay and highly recommended. From the 1940’s build to the cute inset porch to all the wonderful amenities provided, we feel we found a gem in the woods and will be returning regularly for a relaxing friends getaway. We were fairly confused by the previous review as we had a lovely time and did not experience that in the least bit. But some people (or “Karen’s”) are just complainers no matter where they go.
As two women traveling, we felt totally safe and secure in the cottage. Everything was clean and tidy with plenty of extra blankets, towels and kitchen amenities. There are board games and books available as well as fishing rods and canoes. We took advantage of the fire pit and roasted hot dogs for dinner one evening. Our host was incredibly nice and brought us extra firewood for the pit. They made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. There is also a remote control fire in the fireplace, so looking forward to returning in the winter time. There are plenty of cool things to do in Greenville nearby. If you don’t go to Beanz Buttercream Bakery and get a raspberry sweet roll, you’ll regret it the rest of you life. Very much enjoyed finding the surfboard! We instantly became detectives. Good luck to the next visitor! You have two clues to decipher.
We will totally be back."

Stayed a few nights","We had a very nice stay at the cabin. It was exactly as described. We did not use the canoes or the row boats. We came to visit Greenville during the longest yard sale. The cabin was perfect for us. We had one person per bed and we thought the beds were very comfortable.
The Kitchen is adorable with an old vintage porcelain sink , refrigerator, stove / oven combo. The host provided water bottles which was nice.
There is a guestbook in the cabin. someone had started hiding a surfboard figurine, and they would write clues to where the surfboard is hidden in the guestbook. We were able to find the surfboard and we hid it again ourselves and wrote the clue in the guestbook. Kind of a cute touch!
Please no there is no TV! WiFi is limited and cell service is very limited during cloudy times.
We would be interested in coming back to the cabin to explore the lake! Thank you"

Stayed a few nights","Nice cozy fishing cottage in small community about 10 minutes from Greenville. It is truly an old fishing cottage so be prepared for that. The walls are not insulated, so heat and cold (in our case, cold) gets right in. Space heaters and a gas fireplace are available and help take the edge off. The kitchen is small so I wouldn't recommend trying to really cook a lot, but basic kitchen supplies are provided. One thing to note, which the host outlines in advance, the water tank is very small. We got about 8-9 minute showers before the water cooled off. So plan accordingly. There is a small boat dock with row boat and canoe available for use on the small lake. Even though it is a small fishing cabin, it is close to other homes with the nearest two being maybe 50 feet away. With no insulation in the walls, it is eerie to be able to hear people outside. Another reviewer noted ""Uncomfortable beds"" but we did not find that to be the case. They were firm, but not uncomfortable. (Maybe been replaced since that review was posted, not sure). Overall not a bad place."

Stayed a few nights","S.L. was a great host and so friendly! She responded immediately to our questions.
Pros: water pressure in shower was amazing! She provides old school board games such as scrabble and uno- that was fun. Nice outdoor patio area.
Cons: mattresses on both beds are very worn and extremely uncomfortable! We ended up sleeping on the couch, mattresses should be replaced. WiFi barely works, the signal is only good in the sunroom- the rest of the cottage it does not work at all. Dock is very old and not a great place to relax on, she provides a row boat and canoe- we used the row boat but it’s very old and not sturdy.
Overall this is an ok place to stay if you just want quiet, there is not much to do and for us not getting quality sleep was a concern. If the mattresses were updated it would be a huge plus!"

Stayed a few nights","Omotolu went above and beyond with her accommodations. She even got me a baking pan and a Beanz pumpkin pie to help me with my Thanksgiving prep!! The apartment was nicely decorated, very comfortable, and she keeps it so neat and smelling very nice! Getting in was easy, instructions were crystal clear. The place is next to the downtown area, which was decorated and had really wonderful local stores along the strip! My friend from the area laughed when I mentioned how Omotolu praised the cuisine, but even he was impressed with The Merchant's House- amazing Detroit-style pizza and Cowboy Mac n Cheese! If I had to find a downside- the weird bed that sucks you in was still comfortable, just unsettling. I also struggled with my big clunky boots on the narrow creaky wooden spiral staircase to reach the apartment- the building is old, but all normal for Greenville Ohio."

Stayed a few nights","This place was okay for me. It was fairly clean and quaint. It is definitely older. It is not dusty, but alot of the old parts of the apartment (like those old heater things that stand up in some part of every room) are very dirty. The place is vintage, so it makes sense. Omotolu was very nice. She was available when I needed her and gave me all the information I needed. The reason my stay was just okay was because of two things: 1)I did not enjoy the shower experience. It is an old tub with a 360 shower curtain, almost free-standing except for 1 side attached to wall. I did not like it because you cannot bathe without parts of your body touching the shower curtain (it's too small/confined) and also, the rusted drain was a bit of an an eye sore. 2)My sleep experience was also sub-par. I found the bed to be very uncomfortable, as the top part sinks in and the bottom part stays up. The window AC unit blows directly onto the bed, which caused me sinus pain and then a cold, unfortunately."

All of the little extras really made us feel welcome from the snacks and coffee to the games and well appointed rooms. We had plenty of space to spread out but also several comfortable places to gather together. Thw kitchen had everything we needed to cool in and to aid in our meals brought in. The heating and cooling was so easy to use. As Ohio weather is so unpredictable in spring this was so nice. We all enjoyed the wonderful backyard including the hottub, huge firepit, large yard and even a grill. We will be recommending this place to friends and we will be back.

They have a beautiful paved area with a fire-pit, water chain fountain, and a brand new hot tub that we very much enjoyed on the cold night we had. The inside was spotless and had brand new appliances, there were instructions for the TV, Hot Tub, Lighting, etc. This was a great experience and Liz was super helpful and responsive to any questions we had. There was a gift waiting for us on the counter, such a nice and thoughtful thing to do, and we would absolutely come back here again! Thank you Liz for being a great host and for allowing us to stay at your beautiful home!!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I are local; about 30 minutes from this beautiful cottage! We have a child in the NICU and it was our anniversary so we wanted to find a place to stay nearby.
Liz’s cottage was just what the doctor ordered! (Lol.) Close enough to the hospital to relax, surrounded by peaceful, beautiful woods that gave us a feeling of privacy. We had an absolutely wonderful time.
We sat and relaxed on the porch out back with the coffee provided, had an amazing dinner we bought, enjoyed a lovely fire under the stars and full moon, and took two dips in the hot tub before calling it a night! The chain waterfall feature is beautiful and we enjoyed the soft sounds of it both while in the hot tub and next to a crackling fire outdoors. It was truly a magical experience!
That’s not even to mention the beautiful, tastefully crafted environment inside this stay! The cottage was so clean, organized, and just one of the nicest stays ever.
We’re raving to family and planning next time with our son!"

Stayed with kids","The Cottage was amazing!!!! The BEST Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at & we stay at a lot of them! Uncluttered, beautiful decor, bigger than it looks, gorgeous outside space! The kids loved the fire pit! I loved the deep tub that I took a relaxing soak in & read a book after a long night of driving. There were games and a deck of cards that we put to good use as well. Everyone in the family was beyond impressed with the house! Elizabeth even left a nice note and Oreos for us!
Just as a caution, if you use the direction link in Airbnb it will take you to a farm house around the corner on the country road. But my Maps app on IPhone got me to the correct place once I realized we were not at the right house. Waze will work too.
The master bedroom mattress was a little soft for our comfort but we sleep on an extremely firm one at home so that was more us than the bed.
Overall a fantastic stay and we will definitely be back!!"

We didn't have a good spot to eat dinner as there are only two chairs at the upstairs table. the backyard would have been nice for the kids to play in but the grass was high. The water in the refrigerator has hardly any pressure so filling up water bottles was a chore. Most Airbnbs I stay at takes care of the trash etc for you, but here you supposed to get the trash out to the detached garage before you left, which is just one more thing to do when trying to get pack up and in the road. There are more knick knacks than I wanted to keep kids away from. Cute house and cozy decor-just did not work well for us ."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay. This home is cozy, comfortable, and full of character. Our hosts were kind and welcoming and communication was excellent. We particularly appreciated the view of the trees and landscape from the many windows in the living room and the wonderful sense of history in the cottage.
We were in the area to ride the Cardinal Greenway and access to the trail is just a short drive from the cottage. After biking we very much enjoyed a stroll around the beautiful grounds at nearby Earlham College. Richmond has a wonderful sense of history and place. On a previous visit we really enjoyed visiting the Gennett Walk of Fame, a must visit for jazz and history lovers!
Thank you Kristen and Mark for allowing us to visit your wonderful cottage!"

Stayed one night",The house and yard are reminiscent of an era gone by. It feels historic yet has updated bathrooms and feels clean. The drive to the house was through a less affluent part of town so that feel did not match the feel of the actual house and surrounding area. Also if you are particular to strong smells that you would encounter in an older home then this might not suit your needs. Overall we enjoyed our stay. The area is so green and quiet.

A bad remodel job was done on this home. The plumbing wasn't done correctly and the floor transitions are awful. Many tripping hazards in several doorways. Basic TV was nice, but the TV itself is the size of a large computer monitor. Good thing it's on a cart that you can pull closer to the seating area. Beds all need new mattresses."

The grounds are beautiful and if it hadn’t rained— we would have been outside all day! But being stuck inside was just fine due to the lovely space. We chose this place to meet our son halfway and celebrate his birthday. Also got a chance to check out a local Amish grocery store! Hosts responding quickly to the few questions we had when we arrived. Checking in was easy as was check out. Would stay here again. (Also enjoyed watching the family of deer enjoy their evening meal)."

Stayed one night","My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Doris. Her place is immaculate and cozy, and she has a family team to help resolve any issues that might arise (as we discovered when the battery in the locking device failed). She herself is wonderfully warm. Also, nearby Versailles is worth a visit (we found it charming). We did notice a strong ""farm smell"" when we were visiting, but that's a bit inevitable from time to time in a farming community, and nothing of this smell got into the house. We would absolutely stay here again and also recommend Doris and her place to friends."

There’s a grocery store only 8 minutes away so we were able to cook dinner and Doris had an abundance of food for breakfast - so kind! Check in and out was super easy. We will definitely come stay again on our trips up North!"

The pastries were tasty and there were other drinks and food items available to use during the stay. There’s a fire stick for TV if you want to watch anything.

Her well stocked refrigerator kept our beverages cold until we needed them for the Eldora track which is a short distance away. When we had returned from the race, she had even turned the porch light on which we had forgot to do in the afternoon. It is the little things like that which makes her a five star host.

Stayed one night","This is a little piece of heaven in Western Ohio. The host could not be more thoughtful and friendly! The home itself was so spotless, comfortable, spacious and beautiful. The check-in was a breeze, the farm fresh Ohio air gave reason to open the windows for a great night's rest. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend 100%."

Doris thought of everything- plenty of towels, toiletries, places to sleep-- the pull out bed was even made up for us when we arrived! Breakfast was so appreciated since we came in late and headed out early. So nice to not have to think about it and there was variety, so everyone was able to eat something they preferred. And Doris was so sweet to come and meet us before we left. We might do this trip again in 2 years and I will definitely be checking to see if we can stay here again."

What a jewel we found in the French House. Ms. Doris takes out all the guesswork when you arrive. There are little note or trips tucked here and there if you have any questions. She leaves a container of sweet treats that hits the spot with the coffee in the mornings. There was also available fresh fruit and yogurts. The house is situated in the country. Not especially close or within walking distance of a convenience store or coffee shop. Don't let that deter you though from this fabulous find. Enjoy the peace and quiet of the rural setting - you won't be disappointed."

Angie thank you for sharing this home with us!! Any questions we had were answered promptly and the Merchant House was a wonderful recommendation for food!! We enjoyed our stay so much!!!

Group trip","This was a beyond perfect Air B&B! Even nicer than the photos. Beautifully designed and well appointed. Stocked with everything necessary for a full family vacation. We enjoyed every moment and had no issues whatsoever. Beds are very comfortable along with all of the furnishings. It’s very evident the owner took great care in the selection of everything. Our family of 6 was in town visiting relatives.
Owner was very responsive. We will certainly be renting it again for future visits into the area."

Group trip","I rented Angie's place for our out of state children who were visiting for their grandmother's 90th birthday. The place was immaculate and very tastefully decorated. Beautiful home with all the amenities needed. As an extra bonus, there was a ping pong table and games in the garage as well as board games in the house. We are a game playing family so it was a nice surprise. The location is very close to downtown where we spent some time visiting the boutiques and coffee shops. It is conveniently located to grocery stores, fast food, restaurants and shopping. Angie was great to communicate with. Fortunately, we had no issues during the stay in which we had to contact her. I would highly recommend this home if you are traveling and need a place in the Greenville area. We will most certainly book this again when the need arises. Maybe for Grandma's 100th!!! :)"

We're from Ohio ourselves, but this home made us feel like we were on vacation. It's beautiful and the street it is on is quiet. It's convenient to get food delivered or go out to a local or national chain restaurant. The hosts have gone above and beyond to make this a welcoming space. The amenities for families are amazing. We have stayed in many places, but this is among the best of the best. The Florida Room/sun room was great. It was truly a house you could just hang out in and relax. Everything in the home is clearly labeled and marked as well. Overall, we can not say enough positive things! My wife says she wishes it was our house!"

We had a wonderful stay. Angie was a great host. The house is in a pleasant neighborhood and includes beautiful front and back yards. The backyard has a table and chairs for sitting, next to a large maple tree, several evergreen trees, and beautiful assortment of small plants and flowers. The kids loved running around in the grass. The back of the house also includes a sunroom, for sitting and enjoying the views of the backyard.
The inside of the house is AMAZING. Recently remodeled with new furniture and appliances. Nicely decorated for a very pleasant experience. The beds and bedding were very good and one bedroom even includes a sound machine for sleeping. The kitchen is well-furnished. Nice bathrooms. There is a printer in the study that we were able to use. Our kids are 12, 9, 6 and 2, and they all found lots of toys and games to enjoy and keep them occupied for hours.
One of our best Airbnb rental experiences!"

If considering Leader Loft, don’t be concerned about traffic noise - the old brick building and its place in the building insulates guests from most of the street sounds. Really appreciate the history of the area, and the way the old building has been reclaimed for a much needed modern purpose. Great stay- highly recommend this place and owner."

Stayed one night","Stopped for a night, last minute (day advance) at Kim's en route to Dayton for an appointment the next day. Lewisburg is a quick drive, 30ish minutes to Dayton, so it was an easy choice given the pics online and her reviews.
The place was as described and didn't disappoint one bit. Nice little touches around the unit and ultra clean. Was a zen like experience staying there honestly. Kitchen well stocked for a smaller kitchenette like set up. Coffee/Kcups left behind which was great. The treats that welcomed me were certainly appreciated. Great water pressure in the shower. Unit has washer/dryer but I didn't use it as I was only there for 15 hours.
The little area outside the unit was quite cute. Unfortunately I got there later Sunday night when everything was closed as I would have liked to drop into a few shops.
Bottom line: Would stay the again. Thanks again Kim. Really enjoyed it."

The cupcakes waiting for us, not to mention your complimentary drink and sweet treat vouchers to your wonderful Flour Bakery were so thoughtful and greatly appreciated and enjoyed!
This was the perfect pit stop on our road trip to Tennessee! Everyone was so welcoming in all the shops we visited. Lori from 1893 Storehouse Co. suggested eating at Bank House Cafe in nearby Verona and it was to die for! We loved finishing the night watching a movie in front of the fireplace.
Kim was amazingly responsive. We even found out that she was on vacation herself, but still made sure to make us feel welcome.
Every single thing was perfection. We will definitely come back someday!"

Stayed one night","Truly unique place—if you want to try something adventurous and memorable, it's worth a stay. The host provided excellent instructions for entry, details and amenities. For example, the coffee shop and the taco truck (the Monument taco is delicious) are both staffed by friendly crews. The build out of the small silo space is thoughtful and, overall, well done. But it's quirky—beyond the silo structure—and there are two things that were less than ideal. 1. There's a strong smell of something we couldn't identify, but it reminded us of a mix of moth balls and wet concrete. 2. The wheeled serving table over the bed is a delightful idea, but the space doesn't allow you move it out of the way and easily move around the bed. Again, great idea, but awkward (and we are slender folks, whatever that's worth). Overall, glad we had the adventure of staying in a silo."

It’s nicely equipped with AC, so that was nice to walk into during the hot weekend we stayed. Definitely test out the water temp of shower before stepping in - it has the gorgeous copper piping & takes a little tampering with to get it just how you like it. Overall, a very fun stay & we enjoyed it very much! If you need to pack chilled food/drinks, I’d recommend packing a cooler!"

I absolutely plan to come back again to experience the things they are adding in the future! Something else I’d like to note: most airbnbs require you to do a plethora of “to-do’s” before checking out. Even though we were sure to clean up after ourselves, I appreciated that there were no expectations or long lists of things to complete before checking out! The coffee/ice cream shop is also worth the stop!"

Definitely check it out, but two warnings:
1) No door for the toilet. Didn’t bother us, but it’s in the open :)
2) Lots of little noises at night (drips, clicks, plants moving, etc.) Not a big issue, but enough that we noticed.
All in all, we loved it. A cute and romantic getaway if you’re in the area."

Stayed with a pet","We enjoyed our Christmas weekend getaway at The Silo. It's a ground floor (no stairs), small, cozy and private room. It was decorated for Christmas. A fun, unique place to stay. It was a very wet weekend and also a holiday, etc. so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor activities. It looked like it would be fun in nicer weather. Pleasant Hill is a quiet town and the silo is located basically on the edge of town in a neighborhood. We loved that we could bring our dog! The shower area was open and it was fun to say we showered in a silo on Christmas morning. Kristen was wonderful to communicate with and I think she is a great host. They had two igloos out back. It was nice to have somewhere to go sit in the morning while my husband was still asleep. A heater was provided in the igloo. One baby thing we noticed at night was the cycling of the humidifier. It was on and off and disruptive to sleep. We shut it off the second night and it was perfect (we turned it back on in the morning)."

The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is because we were cold .
we had the heat all the way up the whole time, but it was never cozy.
When you were in bed with all the blankets piled on you were warm, but my nose was freezing inside the whole time.
The floors and walls are concrete and it was extremely cold.
Definitely just a better location for summertime Airbnb !!
We really wanted to use the soaking tub but i was just to chilly to enjoy !
a beautiful stay but definitely would enjoy summer stay …not November!"

If you are diabetic and need to refreeze your ice packs you may have to work something else out. There were activities to do there plus a great coffee shop with delicious baked goods.

The room was just big enough for two people and was exactly what we expected. There were even some extra goodies in the room! There was a icebox with bottled water and pop. A basket full of goodies and snacks if we wanted to have s'mores on the fire outside. Kristen also brought in a dog pillow just for our little Cassie to sleep on. We had a wonderful time with plenty of things to do and we will definitely be back.

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay here for the solar eclipse. It's a large property in beautiful Amish farm country. Very quiet and peaceful. I could hear the faint clop-clop of horse drawn buggies on distant roads, and the railroad couple miles away. Far enough from big cities that you can see many stars.
Apartment is very nice and cozy size for 1 or 2 (400 sq ft). Furnishings comfortable. Kitchen well equipped -- full size fridge / freezer, microwave, toaster oven, K-cup. No stove but didn't miss it. Kitchen well stocked w essentials and snacks. Everything clean. Dish TV and WiFi worked well. You can park right at the door & only 2 steps up into the space. The rest of the building is a large workshop -- all very quiet.
Hosts live in the main house and are very friendly, helpful, and easy to reach. Home-cooked meals and pies were delicious and unexpected. I felt very welcome. Hosts appear new to AirBnB but I can't think of anything to improve. Hope to return someday. Highly recommended!!!"

Having the highchair was so nice for my 1 year old. The upstairs was significantly warmer than the downstairs but nothing a fan in front of the vent couldn’t fix. Will definitely be booking again when we come back to town!
