Stayed a few nights","Cheryl’s airbnb was such a perfect and beautiful place. She was so kind and helpful with my questions throughout my stay. She also had all the amenities you could ask for and more. Without a doubt, I’ll be staying here again next time I’m back in town. I highly recommend if you’re going to be visiting Battle Creek and need a place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Matt's Airbnb, and it exceeded all my expectations. The space was immaculately clean, beautifully decorated, and incredibly comfortable, making it feel like a true home away from home. The backyard was a stunning oasis, perfect for relaxing with a morning coffee or unwinding in the evening. Matt was an exceptional host, consistently responsive and attentive, ensuring every aspect of our stay was perfect. The location was ideal, nestled in a serene neighborhood yet conveniently close to local attractions. Every detail, from the plush bedding to the thoughtfully equipped kitchen, showcased a commitment to guest comfort and satisfaction. This Airbnb was an absolute gem, and I can't recommend it highly enough. I eagerly anticipate our next stay!"

One note: if you are traveling at night, be careful of the large potholes on the frontage road. While not an issue with Matt’s place, it can be tricky to navigate them at night if unfamiliar. Overall, highly recommend!!!"

Stayed one night","Very clean and as described. Our GPS took us through some non-main roads. We managed much better when leaving as the home is just off the main local highways. Two of us had a business meeting in Athens. The rental was very convenient and close to restaurants. Basically, we were in and out. No time for cooking or relaxing but is seems the perfect place for a longer stay. We were needing only one night; the host offer for one night was perfect.
An electronic fireplace was there with a remote, but no instructions on how to use or if it was off limits: same with the TV. If you do not use Hulu and all the other streaming options, then you may have trouble, as we did, on locating specific broadcasting, like current, network TV. No instructions on the table so it was hunt and peck.
The host has been meticulous in providing all the necessary items for guests in the kitchen, bath and bedding.
Thank you so much for an easy booking and stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Matt's place was cute, hip and very comfortable! We stayed here while in town for a wedding in battle creek. The place was easy to find and a good location for going back and forth to the events throughout the weekend. We enjoyed the thoughtful touches, such as leaving the fireplace on to greet us. The yard was large and great for bringing our dog with us. It was fully fenced, except one small section of fence was only about a foot and a half high - I wasn't comfortable letting my larger dog off his leash as he could have stepped right over it. Beds were very comfortable! It did seem as though someone uses the house when there are no airbnb guests so the fridge/freezer, pantry, bathroom were fully stocked. I've never stayed in an airbnb with that situation, but no one was there during our stay and it felt very private and homey. We really enjoyed this stay and hope to have a reason to come back to this cute airbnb someday soon!"

Stayed with a pet","Matt is an excellent host. He is very accessible and friendly. The home is cute and the lake is beautiful. He has Kayak's available if you want. The area is clean and safe.The pool table when you first walk in was fun to play. The sticks need to be a little heavier and shorter for the space but you can still have fun.The house is very cute and has all the amenities as listed. I love the front load washer and dryer.
The beds are very soft but comfortable. He has a huge TV with streaming so we didn't need to plug in our firestick. The backyard is beautiful and it was nice to BBQ.
There were only a few issues I had.
The fridge had open bottles of items as if left over from previous guest. Matt explained this was his home when not traveling.The water still had a smell to it so, the bottled water provided was nice. The water pressure is very low but we made do..
The couch us very low to the ground and the tub is very high so if you have knee issues as I do keep that in mind."

Stayed a few nights","Matt has done an amazing job of making the house and a beautiful & relaxing space. The beds were comfy. The kitchen & bath were well stocked. The TV is huge and backdropped by a black textured wall giving you a theatre experience. Bedroom window A/C units in addition to central air for hot sleepers. The backyard landscaping was stunning and inviting. Wish we'd of had time for a fire in the fire pit and to take the kayaks out on the lake, but we were too busy with our class union events.
The only issue we had was the tap water was pretty smelly (rotten eggs). Maybe it comes and goes during the year as the hydrogen sulfide levels rise, and Matt said he has been working on resolving the issue."

I let the host know that my boyfriend and I were looking for a romantic night away and when we showed up the host had mood lighting and romantic music playing....my boyfriend was especially thankful for the mood already being set when we got there. This place is hip, cool, and sexy. LOVE the hot tub, , black lights and massage chair. The mirrored wall in the living room was a great addition for adult time. Will definitely visit again!"

As we were heading out to dinner, the host was outside and he checked in with us to make sure everything was okay. He was very friendly and asked if we needed anything else.

Inside was clean and well kept and ready for us. Owner was very responsive if we had questions.
Although it was mentioned in the listing we were surprised by the frequency of the neighborhood outside cat that wanted to spend time with us and was not a fan of us sitting on the outdoor porch couch, which had a lot of cat hair on it (not the best for someone with allergies). Tough for the building owner to tackle this, but wanted to be honest since this an issue we dealt with our entire stay."

The house was as promised and the 2nd fridge was a welcome surprise. We would love to visit again."

Alot bigger inside than we thought. Neighbors/ other air bnb vistors around the lake were nice (waved, said hi etc). We felt welcome and had a great weekend!
Ordered from Mikes Pizza which was local and very good!
Communication was easy and great.
Would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","We rented the cabin on a whim to extend our road trip home. The cabin was just as described. I stayed with my husband and three children (8,6,1). The kids had a blast playing on the beach and in the water. The lake was very clear. We picked up a fishing pole at a nearby store and the kids fished for hours, catching tons of little fish. My husband took the kids out on the kayaks and paddle boat. The porch has a great spot to look out at the lake and watch the kids swim. Inside the home was clean and like the pictures, but felt dark. That didn't matter much because we spent most of our time outside or in the dining area playing all the games and puzzles that were supplied. There's a town about 10 minutes away, we didn't spend much time there."

Stayed with kids","This was such a great place for our family to stay. We had 3 kids, two 5 year olds and a 3 year old. This place was absolutely perfect to keep them occupied for hours. We were able to sit on the deck or the dock and keep an eye on them while they hunted for minnows and crawfish. The ability to use the paddle boat and the kayaks was great, especially having life jackets for kids and adults provided.
The surroundings were very peaceful.
The stairs were a slight inconvenience, especially having to bring so much stuff in with three little kids, but definitely worth it with all the amenities for outdoor fun.
There are two toilets in the house, but only one shower, which was a lot for 9 of us to share. But we managed.
We had a wonderful stay overall, and can definitely recommend The Stairway to the Lake!"

Stayed a few nights","My family and I had a wonderful time relaxing at the lake. It was quiet and peaceful. Most other homes on the lake were without people. We grilled (clean and easy to use gas grill), had a fire (nearby gas station sold bundles of wood), kayaked (my brothers first time), took in the sunsets and moments thought out the days on the deck (comfortably sat four of us) and played games, ate breakfast and laughed on the front porch. It rained on and off and the porch was a perfect place to stay dry while enjoy the beautiful setting.
If we find ourselves in Battle Creek again, we'd look to see if we could stay again at the Stairway to the Lake. Thank you Marlene!"

The adults enjoyed relaxing on the spacious porch, just catching up and enjoying the view. The house was absolutely charming and enough space for our crew. The only detail that was a little iffy was the WiFi. It really wasn’t an issue for us since we were there to relax, but if someone needed access for work it might be tough.

Only hiccup was the internet was having connection issues , but Marlene was very quick to respond and remedy the situation. And also refunded me back a small refund to accommodate the inconvenience. I'd happily go again in the future . I've already had several friends inquire about the info to set up their own stay there after seeing all my photos .Cute and quaint. Very clean lake .

Group trip","Staying at Marlene’s was amazing! The house was so cozy and clean. The table in the back room was great for breakfast and games. Speaking of games, Marlene keeps some in the living room near the fireplace. The lake was quiet and peaceful, with a great seating area to enjoy morning coffee. Be prepared for LOTS of stairs, they’re worth it. Marlene responds quickly and is helpful with issues. She left water bottles in the refrigerator for us to use, which was appreciated since we didn’t realize that the house has well water and we are used to city water. The view of the lake! It was absolutely beautiful and peaceful.
Cons:
I will say that we had some trouble finding the driveway even with Marlene’s detailed instructions. It was covered with leaves and we passed it several times before realizing where it was.
The ceilings and doorways are low, two men over 6ft tall kept bumping their heads when entering or leaving a room.
The WiFi does not work. The router and modem are right next to the TV but the connection was not strong enough to load a show or movie. We had to use our hotspot to watch TV.
The water filter on the refrigerator was not working, but since there were water bottles it was not a big issue.
The driveway is steep, so if you’re planning a trip late fall or early winter you will probably get stuck in the snow.
The stairs are not well lit for nighttime. My recommendation would be to add some lights to the railing on the stairs so it would be easier to see."

Stayed with kids","Our stay was a mixed bag, but overall we enjoyed our trip. We were three couples with kids who stayed at the house. I’ll start with the cons -
- Main bathroom door didn’t lock, so we sang songs to alert others while doing our business. Another bedroom door also didn’t close properly. One of the bedroom ceiling was falling apart. I did send the pictures to host.
- the interior of the house seems very congested/busy. You have to be careful walking around. One of the beds had sharp edges, which scraped two of us. Clumsy me also bumped my head hard on the low ceiling downstairs and scraped my elbow on one of the pillars.
- After the kids were exhausted, they wanted some tv time. But the internet was extremely weak and never really worked for us.
Pros -
- The outdoor space is fantastic. We enjoyed every bit of it and the kids had a blast. Kayaks and the paddle boat were a blessing. Waking up to the view in the morning and sipping coffee at the outdoor space was the best feeling.
- Quick communication with the host. The fridge didn’t have ice or filtered water. But she had left water bottles and a large ice bag for us.
- Kids dirtied their clothes every few hours playing in the sand and water. So the washer and dryer was a big help"

Stayed with kids","Don't be inhibited by the stairs! There are a lot (41) to get down to the house, but once you are there, you are steps from the lake.
You enter in to the upstairs which is where the bedrooms and bathrooms are located. There is a set of stairs with a sturdy rail leading down to the lower level where the kitchen, living room and dining room are located.
Everything was clean and tidy when we arrived. There were plenty of kitchen amenities available and no need for paper plates. The fridge is large and easily held all our supplies with room to spare. A dishwasher is there to make cleanup a breeze and the soap was under the sink. I LOVED the custom table that easily sat 8 people. It was great not only for meals, but to play games at in the evening. The nice touches of the string lights made it even better. There were games there, including a Euchre set that was great!
The deck was wonderful to lounge on in the couch that went the entire length, with comfortable cushions. There were plenty of adirondac chairs for everyone, along with a few beach chairs. There is a very large sand area that goes from the deck all the way to the water. It was great for my grandson who loved all the sand toys to play with and made it easy to keep an eye on him. We made use of the available kayaks, the lake is not too large and can easily be handled by even an amateur. There was a pedal boat available too which the kids loved. A fire pit is available to use as well.
There was a gas grill there to use and it ran out of gas while we were there. I messaged Marlene and she informed me they already had a full one there waiting. What a pleasant surprise! No interruptions to our mini vacation. Also, between the room air conditioners and dehumidifiers, it stayed comfortable our entire stay.
In case you were wondering, there is a Meijer and a Walmart less than 10 miles away in case you want to just grab your groceries after you get there like we did.
I would definitely stay here again! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars were things that Marlene could not control. The WiFi went down after the first night, I'm guessing due to the recent storms in the area. I didn't mind as much, but the adult children whined more than the kids! LOL And we had an issue with some bees in the area."

Stayed with kids","The lake-house is a great bargain and a wonderful location on the lake! The kayaks, paddle boat and life jackets for almost every size are a huge plus and kept our kids entertained throughout their stay. The back porch and the dining area looking out at the lake are great for relaxing and having fun. We saw numerous people fishing and it seemed like a nice fishing spot. The proximity to the water naturally results in a lot of bugs so you just have to be prepared with the insect repellant.
Overall, we liked the value of this location but gave it 3.5 stars because of a few minor issues with cleanliness - there is a foul odor coming from both bathrooms and less than ideal condition of the toilets - a simple auto-cleaning tablet usage could likely fix this. Also, one of the rooms upstairs has the detached AC unit, which is really loud and had a filter issue and kept waking some of us up the first night. The rooms with the in-wall AC units are perfect and not loud. The water also had a very metallic taste and we didn’t drink the two water but did boil it to cook."

Stayed with kids","The lake is literally in the backyard, it provided hours of entertainment for our kids. We didn’t have much luck with good restaurants in nearby Battle Creek, but there is a grill and everything you need in the kitchen so our best meals were right there in the cabin. The dining area looking out to the lake is so cozy and beautiful! The kids were also impressed with the game and toy selection. My daughter said “man, they are so prepared here!” They are not exaggerating with the stairs, there are lots of them. And my brother is 6’4” and had to duck in multiple areas of the house. Just something to think about if you are much taller! And I am sure it is not always the case, but the mosquitoes were EVERYWHERE! So make sure you bring bug spray just in case. The porch would have been perfectly peaceful and lovely to sit and lookout had it not been for their invasion. Otherwise, it’s a perfect coffee sipping spot. It is a very relaxing location, great for spending time with family."

Stayed a few nights","Marlene’s cottage on the Clear lake is like the cottage you would imagine when reading a story book. It is not only confortable, great for fishing, and peaceful, but it also feels like home away from home. If you are looking to get away from the big city fast place noise, or just get away from your regular every day routine, this is the perfect place. You can get up in the morning go for a ride on the kayak, afterwards you can go fishing, in the afternoon you can relax and sit on the porch overlooking the Clear Lake or go for a swim in the crystal clear water. The water can be a bit cold, but on a hot summer day it can be refreshing. In the evening you can grill while setting up the fire pit outside. You can end your night relaxing by the bonfire overlooking a very peaceful scenery of the lake and also enjoy the beautiful star filled sky. When sleeping you can enjoy a very comfortable bed and cozy pillows. Overall we enjoyed our stayed at the cottage and look forward to doing it again. Thank you Marlene for making our experience magical."

The kitchen has everything you need, and the most comfortable couch in the living room! It was such a peaceful vacation because big and little things were considered in setting up the house.

The kitchen was well equipped to make dinners, the outside area is really nice for lunch outside and bonfires, great views from the living room, but the best part was the 2 kayaks and 2 paddle boards. We used them every day, I fished from them and had a blast. There was a bags/cornhole set and tons of games to play. It was better than expected and we had high hopes!
One note is there is no dishwasher or grill. We knew this going in so it’s not a negative at all, just pointing it out since some folks assume these items are at airbnbs. Would definitely book this place again!"

Please note there is just one bathroom (we missed that when booking and there were 5 of us getting ready for a wedding!).
Please note the kitchen is adorable but somewhat lacking in mixing bowls, and has just the most basic pots and pans, and didn't seem to have much in the way of food storage (i.e. pyrex or Tupperware). This was fine as we did not cook a lot but if you are planning to make big dinners you may need to bring a few items from home. Wendy is amazing and I am sure could help you sort out your needs."

Clever studio design - especially the pull down bed, the sitting area and the TV(s) set up. Awesome mattress too! I think it was a queen size but it was amazingly comfortable.
I have allergies and there was no evidence or ill affects from pets being in the space.
Another recommendation for True North Ice Cream - YUM! but drive another 3 minutes past there to eat dinner at SandHill first. Our best meal in Marshall!
We will definitely stay here again when we visit Marshall."

The space was exactly as described and it was clean and it worked great for us. Aron helped me with the refund for me and my family on the days I had left on our reservation. Highly recommend renting this space or any that Aron offers. With all I had going on I didn't have to worry once about my rental and what had to be done. The whole process gave my wife and I peace of mind.

We had a couple issues but Aron responded promptly and was very helpful with local restaurant recommendations. We got about an hour away and realized we’d forgotten a camera battery and charger and he quickly responded that he would mail it back to us. We would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area!

Stayed with a pet","The place was exactly as pictured! Right down the street from Historic Marshall, and on a very peaceful street.
Check in was a breeze and we ran into no issues during our stay! There is a nice window unit air conditioner that kept the place at a comfortable temperature. There was also a tower fan in the living room/bedroom for even more air circulation.
The bed was comfortable enough, definitely good considering it’s a Murphy bed. My only recommendation is to bring some extra blankets if you like to be extra cozy, there was only one small throw provided.
Overall, our stay was perfect! We will definitely book with Aron again when we are back in the area!"

Stayed with a pet","We highly recommend stay Aron's place in Marshall. The house was clean and up to date. The city of Marshall is an AirBnBer's dream. The town is so charming, you'll want to move there. The house is nestled in an adorable neighborhood packed with old style houses that are all well kept. We felt very welcomed. The downtown area and main drag is a 2 block walk from the house. There were tons of great shops and restaurants all within walking distance. Make sure to try the pizza and beer at Dark Horse Brewery.
Aron is a great host. He was very responsive and helpful when we had some issues with our car. Our dog destroyed one of his blinds and he was very understanding and worked with us to resolve the matter amicably. I highly recommend his place and if your looking for a charming town to move to, try Aron's place in Marshall first. You won't want to leave."

Stayed with a pet","My initial thought was that this was a nice place, until I turned on the heat. I learned the furnace is located in the bedroom/living area with no ventilation and no circulation. This room would be 80 degrees of dry heat while the bathroom and kitchen were still 60 degrees. Guess if you stayed here in summer you’d be better off. My first attempted night staying I discovered my hot water was not working and informed him. Four hours later I was asked to wait until the next day for him to check it out, being in healthcare I need to shower daily. So I had to sleep somewhere else with working equipment. He informed me the water tank was working, I drove back to discover I still did not have hot water. After informing him and waiting more than an hour for a response I had decided to leave. Between the dry air, the lack of courtesy, I was at a complete dismay on how anyone would recommend this place. It had been four days into my rental time and I was not able to sleep there once."

Stayed a few nights","We gave Sarah's place all five stars but our review is based on her communication not our actual stay. Unfortunately the day before our check-in a storm knocked out power to the area. Sarah immediately notified us of that, as well as the electric company's estimated time to restore power, which initially was before our check-in time. She was very diligent in keeping us informed of the electric company's continued pushing forward of the estimated time to restore power. It ended up being 2 or 3 days into what would have been our stay and since we were on vacation, we had to find another place. Sarah did offer to let us stay there at no charge and did issue a full refund for our booking. Based on her honesty, excellent communication and the location of her place, we would definitely book it again next time we're in the Battle Creek area!"

The house has plenty of space and many rooms for adults. A classic theme helps make the house feel authentic. There are three bedrooms grouped together and a fourth in the basement which allows for some separation.
Sarah had great communication and the instructions for checking in / out were straightforward. The house rules are minimal.
Overall this was an A+ stay for me and my family and I'd definitely come here again for future visits."

Stayed a few nights","I booked this Airbnb because it was close to my son’s athletic competition. I was on the fence but booked it because of positive reviews. I imagine positive reviews were from people who frequent this house in the summer months as there’s a lake nearby. We’re renting in February & by the smell of the house, I’m guessing it hasn’t been rented or opened up in a while. Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the smell of mold. The sofas were very stained/filthy. I ended asking my kids to not sit on them & instead, draped extra sheets and bedding over them so my kids could sit down. The dishes and silverware were dirty too - ended up rewashing everything we used as most dishes/utensils had food on them. The basement appeared to have water damage/mold. I had to re-vacuum due it # of dead bugs and live crickets. Found water damage in the upstairs bathroom too and mold by the toilet and bulging back wall. I won’t ever be staying here again but if I had to rent, I would only pay $300."

Stayed a few nights","House in suburban neighborhood of Battle Creek. It is on a main road, Capitol Ave, with lots of traffic, but the traffic noise was not that bad. There is a living room with very comfortable couch and Smart TV with cable, two bedrooms with lots of closet space, a sun room off the kitchen, kitchen with gas stovetop and oven, full sized refrigerator and dishwasher, basement with another living room with another tv, a bedroom off the basement and full-sized washer and dryer in the basement. The bathroom is pretty small, but has all you need. It was New Year's when we were there, but it was quiet. We were visiting family and will stay there again on our next visit."

We started each day with coffee on the back deck and then took a short paddle around the lake. I caught at least a dozen decent size fish. This house was full of small surprises like snacks and a fully loaded fishing tackle with poles. We walked over to the golf course and played nine holes and then returned to the house to grill steaks, fish some more, and watch the sunset as we played scrabble. It was the perfect day."

The entire place was incredibly clean and well maintained. The kitchen is very well equipped, and the island is a perfect spot to sip coffee and work on a puzzle. The shower was easy to use and had good water pressure and hot water, which for some reason seems hard to come by.
The weather wasn't conducive to outdoor activities, but it was nice to look out the living room windows at the water. We were able to log in to Netflix and Prime to watch TV and movies in the evenings.
We can't wait to come back! If you enjoy antiquing, I highly recommend checking out Alice & Giles (Bob is the best!), Amazing Grace, Vint-Edge, and Yellow Door, all located 10-15 minutes away in Marshall."

This is a heads up, not a complaint for late sleepers…the front bedroom gets early morning sun & they might be mowing the golf course across the road…be prepared. Sitting on the back deck watching the water activities, swans & sunsets was so calming. The restaurant right around the corner had good food & friendly. SandHill restaurant, Dark Horse Brewery and downtown Marshall was very close (5-10 mins) and fun things to do. Wish we had more time and definitely would be a place I would consider going back to.

The house felt cozy and had everything we needed, and we loved being on the lake! It’s obvious that they put a lot of thought into making sure their guests feel at home. I’m hoping to stay here again in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","Pros: It’s a good value if you need a house with a large fenced yard for your dogs. Architecturally interesting. Large house, tons of space.
Cons: I would not bring a toddler or small child to this house. The pictures do not show how dangerous the loft section of the house is, and that is where the “play section” of the house is. Massive drop offs without railings. Very severely needs a deep clean, specifically bathrooms and kitchen/dishes."

Ideal. Streaks on the toilets and kitchen cabinets for example. Visible dust throughout visible and identifiable by smell. Some items needed repair including bedroom ceiling fan which seemed unsafe to use due loose screws. Couch missing a leg and bedroom table lamp was broken. Lights and outlets did not all work even after flipping breaker. Additionally countertop in walk in closet was not securely attached and when trying to adjust it, it slid completely off the base and broke. Thankfully our dog was not nearby. Nobody was hurt. Travis was prompt and responsive to our messages but unfortunately we would not stay here again."

Group trip","Positive: Overall this suited our needs and when one of our party was not able to join us at the last minute we were refunded a small amount which we appreciated. Travis was very responsive when the we needed some help with the lights. Location was perfect for where we needed to be. Negative: The whole house needs a deep clean. Little things like high up cobwebs and durty windows, bugs and burnt out light bulbs in light fixtures. The last guest must have had a dog as there were nose prints on the front door glass. Leaves on the back deck. Overall impression: For the price and from previous reviews we expected more attention to details. Disappointed overall."

It was not fitted with kitchen equipment to cook for a family of 4, the deck/patio/grill was dirty and unusable due to the leaves and dirty built up. It was not cleaned completely, lots of dust and dirt inside caused major allergies for myself and family. Piles of trash left at the garage, and food from previous guests in the fridge which we didn’t think was clean and sanitary. The location was peaceful and the architecture of the A-frame was beautiful."

There was everything we needed right at the house and it was so close to everything around town to do, yet set back in a quiet peaceful neighborhood.

Stayed one night","We were just passing through and decided to stay one night. The location is great, very close to everything. I highly recommend the Hibachi Steakhouse for dinner.
The architecture of the house was so different. It had a great 70s vibe, but with modern touches in the decorations. I didn’t expect the house to have so much space. The patio out back was a great place for us to hang out.
Travis communicated well with us to make sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely stay here again if we make it back to town."

Stayed a few nights","We rented this home because our daughter was married this weekend nearby. We’d rather rent a house instead of a hotel room. This house is pretty cool! It’s very spacious, interesting, unique, etc. We loved the main floor bedroom with its own bathroom and having the washer and dryer in the room next to us. The kitchen could use some more cooking dishes and a can opener that works. Besides that this home was fun, especially for my youngest daughter, she loved the loft area! The only thing that I would make easier for guests is where to find things such as toilet paper, paper towel, trash bags, and oh they could use more kitchen hand towels and shower towels! Everything else about this house was fun and interesting!! Overall our stay was AWESOME. Thanks goes to Travis who was an amazing host! !"

The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful, and safe. Travis responded immediately to our questions, and even came over to help us figure out how to make their smart TV work! They left coffee and snacks and condiments in the fridge so that we could’ve easily cooked our meals; however, they also left recommendations for their fav restaurants - which were incredible - so we ate out instead. Their house was homey and comfortable - very clean with better linens and towels than we have at our own house. Hands down our favorite Air BnB experience!"

We hope to be back next summer!

Stayed with kids","This is a great house and we enjoyed our stay. The house is spacious. A few things that could have been done better - and I believe they will fix this as they seem to strive for a 5 star review- the upstairs is very warm on hot days… the air doesn’t do much up there… we asked about fans and Travis did bring one the next afternoon, which we appreciated. We did have to go out and buy one the first night because it was too uncomfortable. The other thing was the welcome note told us to clean the house. Not sure that is the job of the guests and there were no brooms, vacuums, or mops to use. When I or my family stay at Airbnb’s, we always leave it picked up, kitchen clean, and pretty close to how it was when we arrived. Outside of wiping bathrooms and cleaning floors, it’s going to be left pretty clean. And maybe that’s all they are asking for, but that’s should probably be clarified in the note. This house wouldn’t be good for those with young kids (toddlers) as there are open rails upstairs, but for families with older kids- it’s great!
We would stay here again.. so don’t take this as negative..just some things to know and think about!
Thanks again."

All the way up to and through check in, Travis communicated with us and guided us through all the steps. Upon arrival, we found the home to be even more beautiful than the pictures could show. Travis and Sarah even left us a beautiful card and celebratory drinks :). I could not say more about our experience or this beautiful home.

There were cobwebs all over the rafters and shortly after my colleague who has asthma started having breathing problems so we had to leave. In addition, the home was rather scary with weird rooms and offshoots. Crosses and prayers were everywhere throughout the house giving us a rather unsettling feeling. Many Cameras surrounding the outside of the home made us feel like we were under constant surveillance for the short time we were there. Would not recommend for anyone with breathing problems or have any remote fear of haunted houses."

Stayed with a pet","Architecturally stunning, with many original mid-century details!
This Frank Lloyd Wright inspired home has great bones and the spacious design is accommodating for families of all sizes, including pets. The fenced backyard is ideal for furry family members and kids; with a covered deck and BBQ, you can easily grill and comfortably enjoy the outdoors.
If you enjoy roaring fires on a chilly Michigan night, make sure to inquire to use the stately fireplace beforehand.
The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant to walk thru. It’s a short drive to Downtown Battle Creek - which is home to many small shops, restaurants and green spaces, with access to several urgent care facilities and veterinarians.
Travis is a welcoming, communicative and accommodating host :)
* Please note that areas like the staircase, upstairs hallway and loft have several gaps that young children and pets could slip thru. Please be aware as the crib and changing table are on the second floor. Guests are also responsible for cleaning prior to leaving. No cleaning fee is charged.

* Travelers with Food Allergies and Sensitivities:
Clara’s on the River has several gluten-free choices and accommodating staff. Horrock’s Farm Market has many allergy friendly food items, including dairy-free alternatives."

When we arrived the fireplace was already going for us(make sure to inquire about its use ahead of time) and there were some amazing chocolates and a bottle of wine for us. Unfortunately we dont drink wine but it was a very nice gesture! The house itself was huge! The architecture is so cool and unique! We had never really seen anything like it. Very clean. Extremely comfortable everywhere especially the living room area. The kitchen was very spacious and easy to cook in with all new appliances. The deck in the back is also setup really well with a grill and nice seating. Unfortunately for us its the beginning of February so that didn’t get any use. But we already talked about coming back to this property when its nicer outside and look forward to that space to bbq and hang out! Don’t pass up this place if its available. You won’t regret it"

This home has quite a unique layout with one bedroom downstairs (king) and all others upstairs in an unusual design. One room upstairs is loft-like (not enclosed) while the others are accessed after crossing an open-sided walkway with views of living room below. Access from the circular driveway is quite easy. It snowed during our stay and the views of the large backyard were quite lovely."

Group trip","Great, architecturally unique, large home conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood close to all shopping (groceries, Target, etc) on Beckley Road. Travis was an excellent communicator and a gracious host. We were in town for a family reunion. The location and the size of the home were perfect for our needs; we'll be back for sure!"

Stayed with kids","Battle Creek cozy—nice property, quiet neighborhood; very clean, lots of space for big family; well appointed & stocked for dining in. Lots of room for kids and dogs to run and play outside, weather permitting. Hosts were great, very responsive and thorough. Dining suggestions were spot on. Note: guests required to clean before departure; no cleaning fee applied. Would recommend this property"

Group trip","Our family enjoyed our stay at Travis’ home. The living room area was comfortable and perfect to gather in the evening. The kitchen was lovely, though admittedly we didn’t need to do any cooking on this trip. The architecture of the house is very unique, which was quite fun! Great, quiet neighborhood that was within 10-15 minutes of everything we needed. Would be happy to stay again if we are ever back in the area."
