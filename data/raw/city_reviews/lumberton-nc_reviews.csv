Stayed with a pet","Well worth the money, in a great part of lumberton. Quick drive to local shops and restaurants. House needs some attention, but nothing that keeps it from being rentable. Neighboring dogs left messes in the yard but otherwise a good stay. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed with kids","This place was as described. Very clean. However in the room we stayed in there was a Bubly can left on the bed post. I assume by house keeping mistakenly leaving it behind. The house was spotless otherwise. Things to note, the water and ice didn't work on the fridge. However there was bagged ice in the freezer. Also many of the outlets didn't fit our standard appliances. About 1 outlet in every room worked, the others didn't. Something to look into for the owner. This was very convenient to stop at on our way from NJ down to Florida, as it was half way. I would definitely stay again for a one night stay."

Stayed with a pet","I'm always a little nervous when a place of lodging accepts pets. I have a dog and rarely take because of this and I have never stayed in a pet friendly place until now. This place was immaculate, clean, smelled fresh, no sign of a pet,,,,except in the yard, which is expected. My dog loves to sniff when he's out.
If you are blessed enough to stay at a place like Tina's and take your pets, be respectful enough to clean up after your pet when you take him out."

Stayed with a pet","Tina’s place was easy to get to and check into. We liked the bedroom/bed situation - it worked really well for our family of four and cat. Be careful with some of the outlets as the covers aren’t flush, especially if you have little ones. The beds are also really high and hard for small children or people with mobility issues to get in and out of. We will stay here again on our travels north/south on I-95."

Stayed with a pet","This was a great place. A few odd neighbors. The house was beautifully renovated but there were some small quirky things. There were very few places to hang things, no towel racks in the bathrooms. We were unable to watch network channels, for football but the host did let us know that beforehand. I just didn't understand it. Overall it was a great place and fit our five adult family well."

Stayed with a pet","This home was very comfortable, clean, and cozy and nicely decorated. Everything was as described and the pictures depicting home were accurate. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe.
Things to note:
Bring your own Keurig kcups if you want coffee. The master bedroom mattress is very firm.
The home has electric air fresheners throughout the home leaving it overly fragranced. I am very sensitive to this and it aggravated my allergies/asthma. This of course is my personal health issue but people with allergies and or asthma should be aware. I have suggested that the owner cut back to one.
Aside from the fragrance issue, it was overall a great value, easy checkin/checkout, and I appreciate that the property allowed my small dog."

The bedrooms were a nice size and the beds were very comfortable. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Lumberton, don’t hesitate to book Tina’s place you won’t regret it."

Stayed a few nights",The place was all we needed. It fit our needs for the nights. I was surprised to get a message from the host prior to check out asking if we were ok. We work nights so we get as much sleep as possible before checking out and moving on. I replied that we were and she said the cleaners were circling waiting for us to leave. I told her I hadn’t seen anyone and it wasn’t check out time but we were out of the house. First time this has happened to us.

Stayed with a pet","Overall great stay at the home. It’s right off the interstate which was great. We were traveling from NJ to FL which allowed us a place to rest our heads for the night. We only used the master bedroom, and bed was comfortable. A few cosmetic features made certain tasks difficult. The switches and outlets in the master bath are not properly installed. The junction boxes are too far back in the wall which made it difficult to turn light switches on or plug anything in. The backyard deck also didn’t have steps so you have to jump down when going out the back door. Besides these minor things, it’s a very convenient home for traveling."

Stayed with kids","Tina's place was a great value for price. first Tina reached out way in advance to make contact about when we would arrive she had someone working to correct an issue at the house and wanted to make sure we weren't inconvenience in anyway. we were checking in super late so she had no issues with that. we were super quiet checking in around 1 am. neighborhood was very quiet and easy to relax and not worry about anything. Tina's place was super super clean and very decluttered . if I had anything that was a negative ..there were no small extras like other airbnbs have had in our past travels ( sugar ,creamer for coffee ) but we were only staying a few hours for sleep and on our way to finish our trip ..so didn't really need too many extras. mastered room had an amazing mattress. would totally stay in again"

We were just stopping over on our way to Florida but didn’t want to stay at a hotel, this was way better and the cost was so reasonable.
I would highly recommend this home for its comfort, it’s location and it’s host.
Thanks"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely home, the decor and color scheme were amazing. So soothing. Very quiet neighborhood, while still feeling like you have plenty of space. Quite convenient to anything you might need even as late as 10 o’clock at night! So many personal touches, the beds were super comfortable.(didn’t use the twins). Lots of thought went into the style of the home.
If you stay here, you’ll be shocked at how spacious it is once you walk inside versus the vision of the outside. Will definitely stay here again, we have occasion to visit this area about four times a year and will never stay anywhere else again."

Well stocked with everything needed. We had a couple questions and Sophia responded immediately. She even came over to drop something off for us. I highly recommend this location. It is clear to see why she us a Super Host.

Also didn't hurt that it's not too far from Cookout , we love this place and don't have any of the chain in NY where we live so it was a nice bonus! Location super private and even though we arrived late still found the place and checked in smoothly at night. Yard seemed super big and would probably be great for kids.

Stayed with kids","Sophia’s place was super clean. It was spacious and had nice amenities like a washer and dryer and full kitchen. There were a few things that could have made our stay better though. There was an overwhelming amount of instructions sent just before check in. In them, it said we could adjust the thermostat which was nice, however it kept kicking back up to the default temperature so my baby and I woke up sweating and I had to go monkey with it in the middle of the night. Also, most airbnbs I have been in have basic toiletries, but not here. Overall it was a good stay and met our needs but I don’t know that we’ll be back."

She even thought of windowshield cleaner. I got to remove the bugs before heading back out on my 12 hr journey.
There is a ramp there for anyone who needs a little help with getting in or who wants to roll in their suitcases.

It felt like a high end boutique room with an amazing personal art touch. The price was the deceiving part since we only expected a descent place to rest overnight during our final leg home, and we ended up in a place that was the best value one could wish for. I just can’t say how impressed and happy we were, not only at the accommodations, but also getting to meet the hosts. Our only regret was not being able to share more time with them."

It was perfect. Nan & her husband did an amazing job at making us feel welcomed & comfortable.
The Room is cute. Has it's own entrance, bathroom & even a nice place outfront to sit and relax.
The bed is nice, comfy & cozy. The TV also had a fire stick which was perfect as we were winding down. Couldn't beat it.
The gardens at the house are beautiful & peaceful so make sure you spend some time outside.
We only needed 1 night as we were passing through, and it was PERFECT!
We stopped at a great brew house (Dirt Bags :) ) and also found an arcade/game center where you pay a cover & play air hockey, pool or a bunch of old school arcade style games. Even had a bar there.
Plenty of gas stations around to grab drinks & snacks.
Definitely worth staying there.

My only criticism is that guests and I’m sure the hosts can hear each other, so it’s best to be quiet and maybe bring earplugs.

Her gardens are phenomenal with lots of flowers feeding the pollinators, butterflies and flitting about joyfully. The bed is amazingly comfortable, it's a special foam type mattress. Everything was exceptionally clean with lots of extras. We had breakfast made by Nan and it was a delicious quiche, homemade zucchini break and melon that she grew. It's a fantastic, magical place surrounded by farm land, and not terribly far off 95, so it was the perfect stop for me and my elderly mom. Her husband, Kurt, was also very nice even if he is a Steelers fan (haha)."

When I arrived and saw the Art Teacher's artist sign I let ought a sigh and new I was in the right place. Plenty of parking and my private entrance was in the front of the home. My private patio was surrounded by lush gardening and water garden thing. When I opened the front door I was speechless. I could almost cry, the decor was so inviting, art work decorated the walls, fresh flowers from the garden on the table along with homemade zucchini bread. The furniture was even hand painted with beautiful floral designs. The antique furnishing and personal touches were so outstanding I was afraid to but my stuff on anything. The amenities were selected with the same personal attention to detail. There was plenty of everything, coffee, tea, water, snacks, reading materials, towels, toiletries, etc. Nan and her husband are so quite I almost forgot they were here. I will return just to relax. Nan's place is close enough to everything with just a few turns to a quite, lush green friendly neighborhood where we stay. I enjoyed riding my bike 6 miles through the neighborhood. And last but not least, the mattress made me feel like I was laying on a cloud, it was firm but not hard, soft but not sinking. As you see I cannot say enough about Nan's place. The price for all these GREATNESS is far below value. I would pay twice as much to stay here. I hope you read it all and stay at Nan's soon. Better hurry she stays booked up. I was blessed with a cancelation which enabled me to extend my stay. I enjoyed my week!!!"

Nan even left us muffins Saturday at our doorstep since we had left early in the day to get to event we had to go too. One of the most welcoming and comforting Airbnb's i've ever stayed in.

Next time we are in Fayetteville we know where to stay again."

Nan""s place was a perfect stop and stay on my trip.
The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. A large full bathroom attached to a decent sized bedroom. Nan and Kurt born introduced themselves, and were gracious hosts. The location of the unit is close to 95, yet in a quiet area surrounded by farms. The outdoor area is landscaped and gardened nicely.
I highly recommended this place to single or couple travelers. I will visit again if i an in the Fayetteville, Fort Bragg area.
Thank you for an awesome stay.

Bed was comfy, pillows were fluffy and plentiful. No problem with WiFi or cable. Don’t expect to find nightlife or five star dining in the area but you won’t have to starve. It was just perfect. Bath was very well appointed and towels, soaps etc. were plentiful and the bath was roomy just as the bedroom was. In the morning we dinned on Nan’s home made muffins at the table with her flowers as a perfect touch. Nan and Kurt were perfect hosts and we would not hesitate to stay with them again."

Coffee/ tea, WiFi, mini fridge with some homemade treats to welcome us were only some of the lovely amenities Nan provided.

As this was a midpoint destination, both to and from SC, check in time was pretty late at night. Nan does a good job of clarifying the rules for check in and was very accommodating to our unusual schedule. As for the home, it was decorated beautifully and smelled lovely! We felt that we had absolutely everything we needed for our stay- from a morning cup of coffee to shower supplies. We would definitely book again!"

She has everything that you will need including powdered coffee creamer or milk...whichever you prefer, microwave, minifridge and an Amazon Fire stick with options galore for your TV viewing. Her gardens are amazing and a peaceful place in which to wander after a long day of traveling. I also really enjoyed the private patio area at sunset where we could listen to the birds and enjoy the peace of a home in the country."

Stayed one night","Truly a wonderful place. Beautiful walkable garden with discreet benches overlooking a farm field that is large by NC standards and bracketed by dense woods. The breakfast service mentioned in the profile is well worth pursuing; ours were savory egg pastries with soft muffins and berries and were very tasty. The bed is large and comfortable, there is a TV with a number of streaming services and even internet access built in with a keyboard remote control, and a fridge, microwave and toaster oven. I have to give special praise to the bathroom as well; it’s put together so well it’s an atmospheric work of art with elegant furnishings, various shades of soothing blue and white, a very pleasant lavender smell, and a brewing station with coffee and tea stored in earthenware pots. Lastly the couple who owns this place are very friendly, helpful and accommodating."

Very very clear instructions to get inside, absolutely IMMACULATE, CLEAN, TIDY, did I mention IMMACULATE and CLEAN?!!!! Definitely appeared as if the house was cleaned by a proffesional.
Easy to find and good location close to downtown and main roads.
The backyard and deck were really great spots to relax and walk around to stretch my legs after travelling.
The house itself was much bigger than I thought it would be. There was plenty of space to relax and be comofortable for several people. And the Master Bath is insane. Big enough to be a 3rd bedroom..... and the coolest and biggest jacuzzi bath tub.
I will 100 percent stay here again and again on my half way point driving down to SC.

Stayed with kids","To be honest I wish it was disclosed exactly what a work in progress this house is. It was dingy, sparsely furnished and had several areas in need of repair. The gate you enter to access the house is falling apart. The deck was saggy and uneven. The thresholds to all the rooms are uneven (not an issue for adults but with little kids is a major trip hazard). The bedrooms don’t have bedside tables for placing any electronics on and the electric outlets are hidden behind the beds. We had to use an extension cord we happened to have with us to plug in a sound machine for our kids. There is a noticeable musty odor in the house. Luckily we were only there for a quick one night stop on our travels. If we had planned on being there longer we would have looked elsewhere after night one. We arrived after dark and it was hard to access the lockbox with no exterior lighting. There were no linens for the couch bed in the living room and a stain on the couch."

Stayed with a pet","I rented Williams home for one night on a long road trip with my Dad and younger siblings. William himself was very sweet and responsive. The place was clean for what it could be, it was just the smell of every room that was very unpleasant. It either smelt like feet, mildew or animals. I also woke up with a swollen hand from multiple mysterious bug bites.
Every home around had left their barking dogs outside, so trying to get a very needed good nights rest was out of the picture. Their outside patio was beautiful and the tub is huge but it has a sink faucet as the water spout so good luck for anyone trying to use it.
I feel terrible making a post like this but I was very uncomfortable. My sister has serious allergies and immediately couldn't breathe when we walked in. Nothing against William, he was a great host. It was just the house itself. You can tell they did their best to keep it as clean as they could but it was not worth the price we paid."

Stayed with a pet","Although it's a good halfway point to stop between Florida and New York, the house just kind of smelt a little...damp and doggy. I checked in with my little dog and the neighbors all had (very loud) dogs, but inside the house smelt very much like dirty dogs. I will say the bathroom was very clean and the kitchen items were clean. However, the carpet in the bedroom did have a smell and some stains. I would at least wear socks at all times in the bedroom. Overall it was a very pleasant experience, just not the cleanest place."

Stayed with a pet","Overall, this was a great budget stay, and I WOULD RECOMMEND. 5 star host, 3-4 star house and location, and not because of a bad experience, but just because that's what this area is. The house was exactly as described, and the host was friendly and helpful. Here are the details:
Property: The back fence has some holes in it that open to the neighbors, and while the host has them blocked off, we didn't feel comfortable letting our dogs out unsupervised or without harnesses. The house is very clean! The beds were comfortable, and it seemed to have everything needed. You won't be wowed, but you'll be taken care of.
Location: The neighborhood isn't the best ever, but it's also very standard for this area of North Carolina, so that's hard to rate fairly.
Noise Levels: We stayed on Christmas Eve. Turns out Christmas Eve is a firework and gun shooting holiday, so it was noisy all night. There are a few neighboring dogs that bark pretty consistently as well."

This was the perfect stop for him to rest, and only a few minutes off of I-95. William is a fantastic host and even provided bottled water and lots of snacks. Check in instructions were very easy. My husband had a very peaceful, overnight stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the place was very spacious and nicely decorated, and spotlessly clean. Would definitely book another stay here."

Stayed with a pet","Loved staying at Williams' place. it was cozy and comfortable and was made to feel very welcomed. it's always very difficult when you have dogs with you that you've trained to be respectable when in a new environment and so they are very well behaved and when trying to break the stigma other pet parents have placed on hosts is challenging. especially when those other pet parents don't follow the same principles as we have with our dogs. Although William was very accommodating to our 4 well-behaved fur babies. not to mention the home was extremely clean and well organized, and I also loved the jacuzzi tub!"

Stayed a few nights","I chose Williams place because I make frequent trips to NC and wanted to stay somewhere other than the local hotels. The house was located about 10 mins away from family and in the vacinity of various restaurants/stores. The neighborhod has more of a city feel as opposed to a country one but it was extremely quiet and felt very safe. The house is old, but that fact is stated clearly in the description and it felt very much like home. The pictures are accurate, William provided an ample amount of supplies (cleaning, toiletries, linens, towels), and the place was clean. The beds were extremely comfy and it was easy to find something entertaining to watch on television. I was a fan of the master bathroom because not only was it huge, it contained the infamous jacuzzi tub which is quite relaxing as long as you dont run the water too hot. William was also very responsive to all the questions and concerns that we had during our stay. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and would recommend it."

The house does seem to be a “work in process” as he states in his ad. It’s a diamond in the rough, a few finishing touches are all that’s needed. Not overpriced…highly recommend!"

I let it go and this man proceeds to file a claim about smoking which we absolutely didn’t do because we were never in the space long enough to smoke . Just get dressed and go that’s it .

Stayed a few nights","Best value in town!
I got lucky when I found this gem in Lumberton! Two full bedrooms and two full baths with a luxurious hot tub in the huge Master Bath to soak away your worries!
William has thought of everything in this charming WHOLE HOUSE offer! Full-sized refrigerator and stove, microwave, Keurig full-sized AND pod coffee maker, everything you need to feel right at home! There is a quaint little back deck and backyard area, perfect for grilling, and private parking off the street so you can feel safe with your car and belongings.
I couldn't be happier with my experience in this house. William was available and easy to work with from the very beginning, and thanks to his navigation, my whole experience was a smooth and pleasant one. I would definitely stay with William again."

Water was hot and the washer and dryer were wonderful.

Stayed a few nights",To say it was 5 stars was a bit of an overstatement. Jaywan was very responsive and was great. However the room was a little bit different. The first night one of the beds broke and had to contact him to come fix it the next day. The next day the repair man came while we were out and locked the door wrong and we were stuck outside for about an hour. This is the only time Jaywan had been unresponsive to me. Finally we got inside. The room was nice. It was basically as described. Not as stocked as it may have seemed online but that’s okay. Thankfully we brought everything with us. It was an okay experience.

Jay was very responsive, understanding and accomodating from the initial conversations about the stay and throughout when questions arised. The home was very spacious, clean and beautiful. Our children had more than enough space to run outside and play. The House wasn't to far in location from Walmart and other eateries. Jay was even compassionate when it was brought to his attention that some of our family was in an accident while there and that we needed to check out at 11am instead of 10 due to train scheduling. Jay is an excellent host or cares not only about his property but his guest! We would definitely stay again and refer him to others."

Stayed a few nights","First let me say that I’m originally from Lumberton and was really surprised to see an Airbnb in the area but especially one this nice. I’ve never stayed in a mobile home before and trust me it looks nothing like the outside or the surroundings.
It’s located across the street from a discount warehouse and right off the highway. It was raining when we arrived and the host was kind enough to not only inquire if we made it in town safely but also remotely unlocked the door so we didn’t have to fumble with the remote lock. I would definitely recommend downloading the August app for easy keyless access to this space.
The accommodations were just as pictured, smelled nice and it was very clean. It was moderately/very well appointed with updated appliances, full cookware and baking set, flatware and dishes. A Keurig (with the latte and cappuccino maker), creamer, sugar and various k-cup pods were also available. I wished there was a measuring spoon/cup set because I actually did cook.
There was a grill on the back patio with furniture but we didn’t use it due to the rain. Speaking of, please note that there is no paved parking, just grass (or mud if it’s raining). Also the main bedroom is on the side closest to the main road so if you are a light sleeper you may be very aware of cars driving by at night. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","I see why Jaywan is super host and this little hideaway is super comfy and cozy!
Thanks to the Nest air system and nice mattresses we all slept comfortably at night and were perfectly warm/cool during the day. Found everything we needed in the kitchen and baths. The oversized state of the art washer and dryer were also a treat when my son spilled salad dressing on his only jacket.
Jaywan was the perfect host. He Splurged on multiple (4) TVs and all the premium TV channels. My kids and dad were in heaven. Actually so was I. Most ABNBs only have 2 TVs and only a few channel choices. During our down time, having all of these viewing options plus the Wi-Fi is a real luxury. We were really pleasantly surprised. My kids are usually constantly negotiating for the tv during the entire vaca, here it is not an issue. THANKS 🙏🏽!!! Jaywan said He wanted his guests to be just as comfortable away from home as he is when he’s at home. So he provides Disney Plus, HBO Max, Starz , Cinemax, Hulu Peacock. Prime. Paramount plus, Netflix. Movie night was a treat!!!!"

Getting in was super easy, and everything was newly remodeled, extremely clean. The kitchen and bathroom were exquisite. Comfortable bed and bedding. Lots of towels. You could tell that they put a lot of thought into the comfortability of their guest. If you have forgotten anything, I’m sure that they have it from spices to cook with, to not having a toothbrush, body soap, shower, cap, little chocolates, and after dinner mints, a continental breakfast offered extremely thoughtful little details."

Super clean, beautiful and has everything you will ever need. Didn't even have to unpack our toiletry supplies, as the bathroom is well stocked with anything you need. This makes it super fantastic when you are only staying a night to rest up for the rest of the journey home. Even fresh eggs in the refrigerator for the next morning's breakfast. What a treat after eating powdered eggs for nearly two weeks at a hotel. Do not hesitate to book this Airbnb. You will not be disappointed."

All the information we needed was provided. When I had issues with the door code Mr. Michael was quick to help. This place is just perfect! Extremely clean and cozy. Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. You can tell their heart went into making this place feel just like home. The bed is comfortable, bathroom is excellent (I loved the shower) and location is incredible & peaceful.
The weekend was comfortable and memorable.

Stayed a few nights","The place was absolutely beautiful. All the amenities were well thought out. You do feel right at home. Bed was super comfy!
Here are my concerns: 1) Chickens/rooster waking you up early (which is mentioned in the Airbnb description) it just happened for long periods of time in the mornings. 2) Co-host Mark was unfriendly in his responses about checking in earlier. The reviews showed that some guests were accommodated. I understand cleaning the rental for the next guest, but don’t say I can check-in early then switch back and change your mind then switch again. It was a lot of unnecessary back and forth. However, Arleen was able to work it all out. 3) Get back to your Airbnb before dark. I got back to the place around 10:30pm and it was super dark and creepy. I heard singing sounds in the woods and was completely terrified."

It is a true haven away from the roar of big rig trucks, fluorescent motel chains and smelly piles of fried food. Situated next to a lake, you will hear the distant call of roosters and maybe catch a falling star before you turn out the lights. Highly recommend."

Stayed one night","Arleen's place was a choice almost last-minute find on our road trip from Florida to Virginia after Thanksgiving. We weren't sure until just a few days before where our road trip route would go or where we'd want to stop. Once we figured that out, a search for hotel lodging turned up few options. Arleen's offer on AirBNB was more than competitive with area hotels, and no downtown hotel can provide what Arleen has built here - a true home away from home, sparkling clean, with a full kitchen and a full-sized fridge (very important for hauling home all those extra leftovers!) , and plenty of space to relax and unwind in a quiet area not far from the highway. She also provides very comfortable sleeping arrangements, and thoughtful extras like light snacks and keurig pods to get you fueled up for your mornings. Arleen was very responsive to questions, We would definitely stay here again next year, without a second thought!"

Cozy place with a surprisingly roomy kitchen and shower. The great selection of premium TV channels was a nice guilty pleasure after the long days of training I was doing in Fayetteville. Incredibly quick communication: After a check-engine light came on Sunday night, I sent a message to Arleen asking if they knew much about cars. Within two minutes Mark called to say he would call their mechanic in the morning. He did and got me the information I needed! Like so many other reviews, I wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb."

I only stayed one night for work and was surprised for the quick turn around. A little out of the way, if you’re looking for some good food but there were restaurants with 15 minutes.
Only negative was the TV In living room was very slow for streaming. I didn’t connect my laptop because of this but got some much needed rest.
Also, I forgot toothpaste and there wasn’t any available but Arleen definitely had all the other personal hygiene, toiletries and normal household items available.
Definitely recommended for personal or business travel."

Front porch was so inviting and Jaywan provided a beautiful new patio set with matching cushions and pillows. Ooh:.:we used the gas grill at least 1-2 days a week. The home was furnished like those homes on HGTV. So impressed! Kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, dishes, glasses and every utensil known to man. Jaywan’s place has everything you need, a home away from home. Just brings your clothes and a toothbrush!! I 100% recommended staying with Jaywan."

Jaywan was very communicative and though we didn’t need to reach out for any issues, when we did to ask questions he was quick to respond. The cottage was comfortable and home-y, and the bedsheets were INCREDIBLY soft; hands down the most comfortable bedding I’ve slept in, so that was really a treat.
The ONLY con, was none of the interior doors click shut, let alone lock. I would have liked a little more security in my sense of privacy, but I was staying with my husband and children so there wasn’t really an issue of privacy violations and the doors didn’t really negatively impact our stay.
That’s the worst I could say about the cottage. Everything else including Jaywan was great."

Love it here so much we extended our stay. This place has everything that you need. Jaywan is a great host always checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything. Great location for us it was very close to work that was a plus for us. Will highly recommend to everyone to stay here, you will get your money worth."

Group trip","The price was not worth the stay. I booked and paid for two nights but stayed only one night. As an air b n b host myself I was dissatisfied with the experience and the advertisement.
This is a modular home, sited within a trailer park community. The unit had one half roll of toilet paper and 4 sets of towels ONLY. Guests that are visiting and not staying overnight are welcomed in the advertisement, but in response to a question about the lack of toilet tissue I was told there was additional
Tissue in the master closet when there was NOT (I had to buy); in fact despite the advertisement welcoming visitors the immediate response was that I would need modify my reservation to include additional guests , because the cleaner counted 7 people versus 5. The unit was not available at 3pm as advertised. It was not ready at 4pm as discussed. The cleaning person was in the unit 20-30 minutes after check-in. The bathroom doors do not lock properly. There was a brown stain on the bedding. Under the beds were not cleaned ( white particles). The internet/WiFi worked about 25% of the time. Since there is only streaming services available on the TV that meant incessant buffering. Despite these many issues with the stay and the modular unit, the host had very stringent rules about smoking, returning the place to its exact (implied pristine) condition, and shoes in the house; me and my guest respected all of the rules of the home.
I definitely would not recommend staying here unless the price was significantly reduced and the host was explicitly honest about the unit, it’s amenities, and the condition of the modular home."

We were very happy with our overnight stay with the exception that I just did not find the full-size, pull-out bed to be comfortable. :( (Note: My partner said he was comfortable, but I felt like I was sleeping on a rock.) Most reviewers don’t mention the bed - noting for those who need more comfort. Hope an improvement is made on the mattress/bed. Would love to stay again. Everything else is 10/10!"

Would absolutely stay there again!"

The fenced in area for the dogs to play was awesome. We met Reta who loves dogs. We were very happy to be there. Only drawback was the bedding. I may have made a mistake when I booked that there were 2 beds.

A bottle of water was waiting in the fridge for me, which was very much needed after a long day of traveling. Cookies and hot cocoa mix in the kitchen as well. And on the return trip, there was even a small bag of dog treats for my four legged companion. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay and will absolutely try to book here if I’m coming through again this year."

I chose to try Fox's Pizza and would recommend (closest to Reta's). Not alot of food options nearby so be prepared if you want to go out for a meal you will need to drive closer to Fayetteville.

There was a huge dog at the end of the one path that scared the begezies out of me. He was loose and huge, he didn’t come up to us but we scurried away from him. Honestly don’t know if the dog belonged to the host. The property and the tiny house are truly unique. Unfortunately we arrived later than we would have liked and only spent one night but we were able to get a nice mile walk in. I would recommend the place for sure and would love to visit again."

The directions Reta provided were very clear to get to the Airbnb. Great sign right down the driveway to guide you to where to park and lead right up to the front door.
The Airbnb was more than what we expected and we were beyond pleased with the pull out couch (super comfy) and amenities of the place. Super quiet and peaceful night. Only regret is we wish we had more time to walk around and explore the beautiful scenery and enjoy the seating around the fire area that’s right outside the tiny home. This stay really helped us get thru the rest of our trip the following day.
Would absolutely stay here again ◡̈"

Stayed with a pet","Reta's place was incredible! It is in a beautiful setting, right out of a movie. Reta's family owns a tree farm and the walking paths surrounding it are amazing! However, the sleeping arrangements do need to be discussed. I was lucky as there was only me and my dog (with her pillow). I am not sure how two people or folks with limited mobility would have been able to sleep on the ""chair beds"". Yes, the pictures on the posting make it look easy to change the chairs into beds. There is also a set of directions on a sheet of household informational tidbits like wifi, etc.. However, I was unsuccessful and used one of the mattresses I found. After driving all day and two Tylenol PM, I was ready to sleep anywhere. I am not sharing this info to keep anyone from staying here. I just think a more realistic description of the sleeping arrangements needs to be shared."

A pull out sofa would seem like a better option, but even still they do have options to choose from (the chairs pull out to single beds, another little fold out cushion for the floor, and an air mattress). Otherwise, there’s nothing negative I can say because it’s a beautiful home in a peaceful location off the main highway. The hosts were very responsive to messages which I appreciated!

Stayed one night","Our group of three had to cancel our booking at another location and needed to find a place to stay at the last minute. By luck this tiny house had just been listed and even though it had no reviews (at the time) we contacted the host to see if it would be right for our needs and after a quick exchange we went ahead and booked it for two different stays. We were a bit nervous at the idea of being one of the first guests to stay at this location, but we had absolutely nothing to worry about. The property is just a few short minutes off I-95 surrounded by trees and away from all the noise. A code is needed to check in which our hosts sent to us before we arrived and we were able to park directly next to the house itself. A note was waiting for us with a contact number that we actually had to use because we couldn't figure out how to work the tv (which is set up with Roku and Netflix). Not only were the hosts more than happy to help resolve the issue but they wasted no time to get it fixed; when we walked through the door on our second stay the tv was set up and ready to go! There are three sleeper chairs with linens, but an air mattress is offered as a substitute for one of the chairs and a queen sized bed in a separate area can also be used at no extra charge which really goes to show how much the hosts care about the comfort of their guests. There's a kitchenette sink, mini fridge, and stove combo as well as a small microwave and two coffee machines (k-cup and standard). The kitchen provides cups, cutlery, plates, a few cooking utensils, and a convertible table that seats two. The bathroom is roomy, has plenty of towels, and the walk-in shower has consistent hot water with good pressure. What we really appreciated were the small touches such as the snacks/candy on the kitchen table, the waters and sodas stocked in the fridge, the board game in the main area, and the fire wood for the outside pit; on our second stay there were sugars and creamers available as well as body wash and shampoo/conditioner in addition to everything else. However, nothing will highlight how kind and generous these hosts are more than the message we got from them between our stays asking after our well being as they knew we were in Florida at the time Nicole was passing through the state. It was an absolute joy to stay at the tiny house with these hosts and we highly recommend others to stay here whether it's for one night or an extended stay."

I did a bike ride Saturday and then picked her up Saturday night, it was an easy drive to there and we slept so well on the beds, the mattress was so comfortable. Reta left everything in the house that we could possibly need. Her and her husband also had the outside fire pit loaded with wood ready for us to use. It was a wonderful stay, and we look forward to coming back."

We were so happy to find every amenity we could think of and beautiful thoughtful decor. Irene makes quilts that are stunning and examples of her quilting are everywhere, I enjoyed them like being in an art gallery! There is ample space to stretch out and relax with a cozy comfortable atmosphere to make you feel at home immediately. Plenty parking space and a great little yard to spend time outdoors with comfortable seating. Irene heard we were travelling North to celebrate our child's Birthday and made a cake that was waiting for us when we got there. It was delicious and a perfect welcome for weary travellers. My family plans to book here again on our drives up and down 95."

We very much so enjoyed our nights booked with Irene and Charlie and are thankful for their kindness. So much better than a room rental, you can fit a lot of people the way they have it set up! The quilts there are a homey extra touch provided. Loved watching a movie and relaxing fully! Would definitely return."

We only stayed overnight with our dogs a we traveled from the northeast to the south but kept thinking that our grandchildren would have lived the place. Great fur anyone traveling with dogs or a family. And Irene was very responsive and made sure lights were in outside given that we were arriving late. I would definitely recommend her place.

Stayed with a pet","The comfort vibe in this home is excellent. Everything you need is there. Irene was pleasant from the minute I requested to book. The efforts put into this adorable open space really make you feel right at home. We loved that there is no carpet, just a few well placed throw rugs. The cutest little sparkling ball lights as we sat outside in the evening to relax. It had rained a bit, creating some humidity and there were no bugs!! So close to 1-95, if you take exit 41-approximately 4 miles maximum. I would highly recommend staying at this quiet clean well appointed home. The home is exactly as the photos show, if not better!"

Unfortunately, there was a dirty mop water, bleach smell in most of the cottage. We didn't inform the host because the solution would have likely been more disruptive to our evening, and we only stayed for one night. We also found a few hair strands on the pillows and in the sheets. Luckily, there were extra sheets in the closet, so we habdled it and replaced them ourselves."

After staying in pet friendly hotels over the past few years, never again! Doors constantly opening and closing, people coming and going all hours of the night, a restful night was never in the cards. For someone who travels back and forth from NY to FL a couple times per year, we’ll be staying at the Hidden Cottage from now on.
Irene was a great host, provided clear directions, was always responsive, super friendly and even left some treat surprises for the pups!! The Hidden Cottage has everything you could need for an overnight or even a couple of days stay. Place was very clean and felt right at home from the minute we pulled into the driveway.

When I pulled up there were some fairy lights on which was a cute touch and VERY helpful to the unloading process (as it was late at night). The house was exactly as pictured and very comfortable. It was a lot bigger than I expected and would be wonderful for a family trip. There was a FULL kitchen, adorable reading nook and piles of games.

The house looks even better in person, and comes with everything you need for a staycation (pots and pans, toilet paper, paper towel, extra blankets, silverware, etc.)! Irene was very responsive and friendly towards any questions I had! You really can’t beat the price for such a nice place. The hidden cottage is a nice comfy stay and we definitely will be coming back sometime when traveling!"

The hosts are very kind and communication is excellent. The cottage is an amazing value. It is well equipped, in a quiet neighborhood, spotlessly clean and very spacious. And, we so appreciate that the hosts allow our pup to stay with us there. I can't say enough good things about this lovely home."

The house was clean and the kitchen was well stocked with coffee, creamer, sweetener, oatmeal and plenty of other staples. The price was WELL worth it! We will definitely stay again next year on our way to the beach! Irene was super friendly and helpful too!"

My daughter, her 2 cats and I stayed one night on our way from CT to FL, then I turned around a week later to drive back to CT and stayed another night with my son. We felt welcome and right at home in the cottage. You can tell the owners care about the property and want their guests to have a good experience. They provide so many little extras from Band Aids to a full coffee bar, they have it covered! We also loved all of the bright, beautiful handmade quilts and wall hangings! We have found an excellent alternative to staying in a hotel!"

Stayed with a pet","Irene's Hidden Cottage was fantastic! The directions she provided helped us to drive directly to the cottage without a hitch. Easy to get to and very convenient to/from I-95. The yard was nice, the neighborhood quiet and safe. The house was clean, well supplied if you wanted to cook (super nice surprise to find coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and oatmeal), and we had the best nights sleep on a very comfortable bed. Plenty of sleeping space for a larger family. Our dog was very happy with the treat left for her. What a sweet touch. If you are traveling on I-95 and need a good night's sleep, we HIGHLY recommend a stopover at The Hidden Cottage. We were traveling and only spent one night, however, we have already discussed a return trip to stay here again and explore the area. Thank you, Irene!"

There was no smell, no noise, and it felt safe and was clean and sooooo comfy--including the furniture. It was really spacious, and there were so many nice touches: loved the lighting, Netflix seasons I haven't seen of my fav shows, fresh sage and rosemary in the planters, the cabinet of creamers, coffee, cocoa, and oatmeal, nice coffee maker, perfect firm bed (and the other one not so much for those who don't want firm), beautiful quilts, luxury sheets, covers, pillows... easy in and out, super easy quick digital lock. It was truly perfect. Even a welcome biscuit for Willow! And the place is just adorable, so artistic. What an incredibly professional thoughtful host!!"
