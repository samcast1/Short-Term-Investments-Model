Stayed with a pet","I loved staying at Colin & Tiffany’s home! It was so clean I was able to walk around with no shoes or socks on comfortably. The backyard was very well maintained with the grass cut short and no weeds. My dog LOVED the toys at the Airbnb, and I thought the candy machine was super fun. My guest and I couldn’t work the AC and Colin and Tiffany immediately called us and walked us through a quick fix so we could sleep well. The neighborhood was walkable and we enjoyed a street festival last night that was within walking distance. The beds were comfortable and the home was beautifully decorated. I highly recommended staying at Colin & Tiffany’s hidden gem!"

plenty of linens and cleaning supplies. Our son really enjoyed having Disney+ to watch in the evening. Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would recommend Colin’s place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Mobile."

Group trip","From beginning to end, the trip was amazing with the coziness of this house. We felt like we were at home and not just at “a place” for the weekend. We had a great weekend in Mobile and being able to relax here during the morning and at night after a busy day made the weekend a memorable one. I would recommend this home to anyone wanting to visit and being close to the center of everything Mobile has to offer. It definitely deserves a 5* !"

Stayed with a pet","My little one and I loved the cozy cottage! Bringing our pups and having Collin provide dog treats, toys, and water and food bowls was exceptional. Our neighbors were delightful, the area is close to downtown and the home was extremely spacious. Whether you are in the kitchen, the bedrooms, the backyard, or the covered front porch, everything feels as though you are at home. Our stay was delightful. Our favorite thing about the home was the layout of the home and open walkthrough space. We are are a party of two pups, one little one and myself. Even though we didn’t need the extra room, the price was reasonable, the beds were comfy, the entire home had beautiful natural light, and the backyard is spacious. I highly recommend you book through Collin. In fact, we secured our second stay through Collin and had the same experience in a different home only a street over. They are good people, have beautiful homes, they are attentive, and professional."

I would also like to say that Crystal accommodated me for what I rented it for. I asked if I could rent it for a wedding gift for my brother and his new wife. She was very kind and allowed it. I did have to send their information as well, but that would be the right thing to do. I complied and it went well. I thank her so very much and will continue to use her business. Thank you again Crystal."

We were steps away from parade route A so we didn’t have to rush to get a good spot. There is access to 2 parking lots both are close to the apartment. It’s dark in the bedroom which is great for sleeping. It was very quiet to have been in the middle of downtown. Overall I enjoyed my experience and would definitely stay again!

Stayed one night",We loved staying at Crystal's unit. It was perfect for us as it was just around the corner from the Saenger Theatre where we were attending a concert. No need to drive or uber. We also loved that it had an elevator and two layers of secure access that made us feel safe in our surroundings. The apartment was spacious and beautifully decorated. It has a comfortable king bed and even the sleeper was nice. Loved the furnishing and comfortable couches as well as the cute coffee bar that was a welcome wake up amenity. Check in and out was easy and Crystal and her crew were very responsive when we called about a chirping smoke detector. They were over within the hour to change the batteries so we would have a restful night. We will definitely book this unit again if we have the chance.

Also good local restaurants in the downtown area as well as local brunch places such as Bistro Emmanuel to walk to in Fort Conde Inn, Dauphins, Bobs Dinner, at The Battlehouse hotel, and 219 at night during Mardi Gras.

Luckily Crystal had a super fast response and we were able to park without any issues. Beautiful little getaway right in the heart of downtown mobile! Within walking distance to all the bars and restaurants!

Stayed one night","This will be our new go to when we're in Mobile! Crystal's place is beautiful - the pictures only paint a portion of how nice her space is. She has thought of everything from snacks and a light breakfast to allergy medicine and aspirin! The whole place is very comfortable and functionable - I had to do a little work prior to the concert and her desk with a window view was perfect. And I can't say enough about the location - we were going to The Saenger Theater which is a short walk around the corner with plenty of restaurants and shops. Parking is super convenience and Crystal is so quick to respond and provides very detailed information. Honestly, this is the nicest Air BnB I have stayed in and such a great experience with Crystal as a host. We will definitely return!"

I was in town for business and for me, the location to my conference was perfect...two blocks walking to the Arthur J. Outlaw Conference center, and Loda Bier Garten and Hero's Sports Bar (two of my favorite places to visit when in town) are just around the corner! The building is full of charm and character. She had fruit, water, juice, and other goodies waiting on us when we arrived. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with items that would be needed for a getaway. I especially loved the little wagon in the closet to use for bringing our items in and out. My elderly mother went with me and stayed in the apartment most of the time and I was not worried about her at all. Great place and I will DEFINTELY stay at Crystal's place again, and again, and again!!!!! Highly recommend this place!!!!"

Everything was excellent! Cold AC, comfy bed, extremely clean everywhere, an awesome coffee bar with lots of options, and she even had bottled water in the fridge for us.

The location is right in the heart of downtown with plenty of food options and even taverns if you’re looking for a place to hang out and have a few drinks . This was a last minute booking and I left a few things but luckily the unit had everything I needed including extra toothbrushes, makeup wipes, allergy meds.
Even though I didn’t get a chance to cook , the unit was fully equipped and our host even had spring water and few drinks in the fridge along with some breakfast muffins and oatmeal in the kitchen .
I was really impressed overall , couldn’t have asked for anything better. If I could give Crystal 10 stars I definitely would !!"

We bought extra towels since the washer was damaged. I rated it at 4 stars based on its cleanliness, comfort, and generally just a nice place to stay. It was missing some of the extras I’ve seen in a lot of AirBNB’s such as filtered water, starter snacks, extra linens and maybe a few throw blankets.
We would definitely stay here again; we might just being a few more things with us. The description was accurate; it’s not mis-represented at all. Very nice place."

Fantastic location (quiet peaceful neighborhood), beautifully and tastefully decorated with comfortable furniture and warm welcoming color schemes, and yes, when you walk into this home - it looks EXACTLY like the photos. I would have to say that the photos probably don't do it complete justice, because the home has these wonderful cathedral ceilings, which you can't see in the photos, but will immediately notice upon walking in. It was everything my family and I were looking for, and more. The very best part of our stay though - was Anthony. He is a superb host, and very thoughtful and attentive. I do hope that for our next stay in Mobile, we will be able to visit again!"

They have thought of everything you could possibly want to cook, eat, sleep or just relax and hangout in comfort and luxury. Attention to detail was evident throughout….linens, decor, snacks, spices, safety, cleanliness! We would stroll to Callaghan’s in the evening for live entertainment but never heard a sound from the house or porch. Sherry and Ken have rightfully earned their five star reviews!

Stayed about a week","We are from Atlanta, but my husband and I both grew up in Mobile, so knew the Oakleigh district is a fun area to stay. However, The Kirkland house exceeded our expectations for a quiant cottage vacation. The house was as charming as it's pictures look...and then some. We arrived after the sun had gone down, and the cottage welcomed us with it's beautiful outdoor Christmas decorations. We just melted when we drove up! And then we went through the quaint white picket fence, past the bubbling sounds from the front yard fountain, to the welcoming front porch and already felt relaxed and welcomed before we ever went inside. The interior was just as welcoming and exceeded our expectations. The house is impeccable. No clutter, pristinely clean, was stocked with everything we needed, and to top it off, it was wonderfully decorated for Christmas. Ken the owner was wonderful to work with and helped us with questions we had and is a new friend for us. We cant wait to stay here again!"

It’s a great neighborhood, with friendly neighbors but it’s also got a perfect porch just far enough off the street that you feel private. The garden out front with a fountain was so peaceful! I cannot say enough good things- it was the ideal home away from home and anyone should be so lucky stay here!"

This place is gorgeous--clean, impeccably decorated, fully stocked--it seemingly has everything you'd ever need or want in an Airbnb...in fact, it has everything you don't even know you need or want in an Airbnb! After just a few minutes in this beautiful place, we knew we had made a mistake in scheduling only one night of our travels in Mobile--we need to return some day and rent this place again (if it's available). The home has a comfy/cozy 'cottage-like' feel to it, yet it has tons of room (3 floors, an office, backyard & front porch). Check-in and check-out were super easy. Kenneth was always accessible. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, with a welcoming 'pub' at the corner. Kenneth's home deserves each and every one of its rave reviews!"

Someone studied interior design and nailed it!! this, along with high-quality furnishings and HOT water forever!!!
Our favorite spot was the swing on the front porch anytime of day or night. it's everything from peaceful and relaxing to entertaining.

The neighborhood is beautiful and you will truly enjoy spending time in this beautiful space. The porch is a delight morning and night. It’s close to everything downtown yet quiet and peaceful. The hosts are super easy to work with and communicate promptly. Look no further than this listing for the Mobile area. I would book it again in an instant. I’ve been a host myself for 6 years and I know first hand the work that has gone into this space to make it everything you need and more for your trip to the Mobile area. They have thought of everything you could need. Truly a great space! Wonderful value!"

Stayed a few nights","First of all Ron was there every time I needed an answer!! The guest house was exactly as described and very cozy. A little home away from home. Ron provided everything we needed for our stay. There was never a problem with the shared driveway. Being on the main road it wasn't hard getting out and the Location was central to just about everything. I wasn't expecting it to be so cold in Mobile which made it cold in the house.( I did adjust the temp) If you need extra heat look under the side tables. I unfortunately didn't see them until the night before I left.
Overall, I would most definitely stay there again when I visit."

The impeccable pool as well as the grill, both my family, my dogs and I have where to get to Mobile with our eyes closed. Thank you Ron for making our stay a real Pleasure and always answering my questions right away. Congratulations on such a beautiful house. See you soon, I'll see you soon. A hug !!!"

Stayed a few nights","Ron's place is the most complete unit we have rented to date in the Mobile area. It is located in a nice neighborhood adjacent to Florida Street where there are dozens of restaurants, groceries, and local youthful hangouts.
Ron keeps his place on a regular cleaning schedule and his service provider is excellent. It has its own in-unit washer and drier in a dedicated laundry room. Two computer desks, two sleeper sofas, a coffee table and a huge smart TV make up the living room. The kitchen has a huge refrigerator with an icemaker and all of the essentials. The island has an electric range and a breakfast corner with three stools. The bathroom is elevated by one step, but fairly roomy.
There are two air conditioners (dedicated one in the bedroom and large unit in the kitchen). The second air conditioner is redundant and we have never turned it on because the large one has twice the necessary capacity.
We have been so pleased, that we plan to make Ron's our regular rental in Mobile."

Since we have found his place, we stayed there on three different occasions. We recommend it highly and plan to stay there during all of our trips to South Alabama."

The inside was clean and lightly decorated, which was also perfect for a dog that, true to her name, likes to retrieve things. We found several yummy breakfast and dinner options nearby, and being a reasonable drive from the beach gave us a fun adventure day. Additionally, Ron was extremely kind and responsive, despite us needing to change plans several times. Overall, our stay was incredibly comfortable and we will definitely be back!"

Every day I was able to enjoy seeing the horses. Sharon the day I checked in asked if I needed help with my bags she was friendly and after a cold night she asked if I needed blankets or anything else. Overall she was a wonderful host and anticipated needs both before my arrival and during! The location was wonderful and it wasn't crowded, plenty of space between neighbors so I could enjoy the outdoors without strangers. It was a safe and quiet neighborhood which was much appreciated. I was very pleased that it was a clean and tidy space. The pictures were very accurate for the place allowing me to make realistic plans for my trip. Overall it was lovely!

Stayed one night","Wonderful value! If you're looking for a place to party this is not for you but if you're looking for a GETAWAY that feels PERSONAL this is for you! The only regrets I have is only staying one night because WOW... and not gifting her a real plant cus IMO that's the ONLY thing missing inside (plant mamas know). The view of the horses, trees, garden, sounds of nature, and how cozy it was in general was EVERYTHING! You have access to the porch which is worth sitting on and being still while taking in God's beautiful country. It is truly PERFECT for one person.... As hard as it is to admit I must say for someone who is from TN and who is a PROUD VOL I gotta say her southern hospitality was everything.... and SWEET HOME ALABAMA!"

Stayed one night","If your looking for a trip into the past with modern day convience look no further.
Let me explain. I was looking for just a place for some down time after family time, ending the day with no fuss easy to relax/ refresh this was such a find. First off all of the pictures/descriptions are accurate and true. It is a private/personal space for just YOU. Staying there gives me memories of roadside places to stay where the owner is on site, looking out for you. Sharon was present when I arrived giving me a quick coversation and assuring me that if there was anything I need she would and could help if needed. Staying in the room was very comfortable . Shower was more that hot enough with pressure just right. I also noticed that if you were flying in to mobile regional airport this would be the ideal place to stay close by after arriving in Mobile also if catching a flight out there would be no traffic problems. I could go on and on don't miss out on the one of kind place."

From the front porch of this tiny home is a beautiful scenery with gorgeous horses. I got so comfortable that on my last night I completely forgot I had to pack and get ready to leave the next day. I would absolutely highly recommend this location. The host is quick to respond when you need her.

We were minutes away from restaurants. We loved how peaceful , clean and the privacy of the home. Would most definitely recommend this house and would stay there again if I am in the area."

We were in Mobile for my daughter's wedding, and the cottage afforded us a place to stretch out and get things together for the wedding. The decor was fresh and lovely with plenty of room to stretch out. The covered porch was a nice unexpected bonus to have our morning coffee on. It's centrally located in Mobile close to shopping, dining, and The University of South Alabama. Only draw backs were not very fast wifi and never did figure out the tvs. No worries though. Our host was very responsive and very kind. Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa has become a very special person to my family and I... Her hospitality, kindness, and perfessionalism is superb. We have stayed at this location so many times until; I have honestly lost count and we have another date coming up soon to return... Which; shows the validity of how much we really love Lisa's beautiful home.... And it's not just her but her beautiful family that I got a chance to meet due to a minor issue we had with the garage door and they came right over to take care of the problem immediately with the added touch of great wholesome conversation. This place will always be another home away from home for my family and I .... as long as she will continue to have us. This condo is clean and the decor is devine... With all that being said... We will see you soon Ms. Lisa in a couple of weeks 😉🌹❣️"

My son had an injury during the tournament and we had to drive back home to see his doctor immediately. Lisa was kind and understanding and gave us our refund for the last 2 days that we couldn’t stay. Perfect place for my son’s tennis tournament! Very cosy, and comfortable ! A true southern charm !

On top of that, Hannah eased my mind a lot when I asked her about the safety of my car and things inside (I was moving so the car was loaded up with all my belongings). She even offered for me to park my car in the driveway which was not originally included with the cottage.
Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my stay, would recommend her cottage to my friends at the drop of a hat, and would stay here again.
Thank you so much, Hannah."

I was in town visiting my family who live further out , and needed a nice cozy clean place to unwind .
Hannah thought of everything-It felt like home for my two girls and I to stay! My little one and I cuddled up on the giant bed and my older daughter took the couch ! .. it was just right for us 🦉🌳🦉We even saw an owl flying over head from the garden 🪴 and loved the giant oak trees and slice of history that Mobile offers!, I grew up here, and I can now share with my girls!!
We were all so in love with the place, the girls did not want to leave !
The giant king bed was like pure luxurious heaven and the kitchen and the rest just felt like a cozy little dream !
It was so well stocked with so many surprises, we absolutely love this place !
We will definitely return here when we visit our family in the future!! And I can’t even wait for a couples visit with my man to explore more restaurants downtown etc !!

Stayed over a week","5 star host struggling with an aging 3 star property. The cottage was clean and well appointed but it’s age is starting to show. This was one of those anything that can go wrong did go wrong kind of stays- leaking washer, 52 degree refrigerator, dirty water out of the faucets, and roaches. Despite the problems Hannah was extremely responsive and apologetic. I’m sure she will get the kinks ironed out.
The cottage is well off the road behind the main house and the stepping stone path makes for a long haul if you have lots of luggage so beware of that. You might ask them to move their cars out of the driveway and open the gate so you can get closer for check-in and check-out."

We wanted to move in, the cottage was better than a Fixer Upper House by Joanna Gaines, if that tells you about all the special and cozy touches. We especially enjoyed the coy pond outside our bedroom with the rolling fountain.
We will definitely be back to Mobile for the entire weekend to explore Mobile !"

I am one who is afraid of cats, there are a couple of cats on the premises . Hannah's place is a nice place to getaway and spend a weekend but really didn't care for Mobile Al.

We loved everything-from the gorgeous live oaks in the neighborhood to the perfect touches Hannah created within the house. The outside garden was adorable and private. It was both quiet and comfortable and I would highly recommend Hannah’s cottage!"

The street is quiet, safe, and beautiful, and the space was clean and ready for us; we also appreciated access to her washer/dryer and coffee. We would happily stay in this sweet cottage again!"

The bed and pillow were some of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on and i find my whole stay very relaxing like I was at a spa. I loved how you could hear the sound of the birds in the am, the host had homemade sugar scrubs in the bathroom, fresh flowers clippings around the house, and a full kitchen set up for anyone that likes to cook ❤️ I loved how the host was eco friendly and overall would definitely recommend this hidden gem."

Part of it is location (a short drive to 65 on the west side of Mobile) and a quick drive in to the city. Safe and friendly neighborhood. Very walkable to see a couple of the historic districts. Very fast and courteous response to texts from Hannah. Everything you need in the extremely charming cottage. Loved the personal patio and water feature and privacy. Stay here - you’ll be thankful you did!

Stayed a few nights","Hannah’s charming cottage is that and more. The first step inside after a day of travel truly made me feel that I was “home”. Everything I needed for my week’s stay was waiting for me. In addition to the lovely surroundings were a very comfortable king memory mattress, fully equipped kitchen and sparkling clean everything. Hannah created a book of everything to do in Mobile. Location is handy to the city as well as to the art museum and botanical gardens, which are must-do. Nice, safe walking neighborhood, Publix a short walk away, and a main boulevard that leads right into Mobile is just 2 blocks away. Even closer is Hannah, who responds to every question or request immediately. A perfect place to stay to explore Mobile and the bay and the Mississippi shore towns."

Stayed one night","My mom and I were on the way back to Florida from the west coast and decided to stop in Mobile for the night. Hannah was super quick to respond and so easy to communicate with. She made our check in a breeze. And her place is so homey. It managed to erase days of driving off my body in one night. Such a comfortable bed. In such a gorgeous location. The patio outside the guesthouse is super sweet. My only wish is that we'd gotten to spend more time. Oh, and Hannah called me to let me know that I'd forgotten my pillow after we left, which I am so grateful for because it's my absolute favorite pillow. I felt so taken care of in this whole process. Really, an amazing host and an amazing location."

Definitely relaxing and serene! We had a great time napping and relaxing on the couch watching Netflix and ordering sushi in (we just got off a 5 day cruise). It was a little chilly, but we still were able to enjoy the private patio a little bit. We had everything we could have asked for and then some! The bed was super comfy and towels super fluffy. Hannah was great and so kind to accommodate an early checkin and late checkout which was much appreciated! We would def recommend and will be back again!"

The bed is a nice firm king-sized bed - very comfy with nice linens. The towels are super fluffy and the shower is great! There’s a big screen tv and a comfy couch and a couple of chairs, offering space for naps, reading or watching tv. It was cold when we were there so we didn’t get to make use of the lovely outside space. Maybe next time!"

Stayed a few nights","Sharon is a good hostess. Access to the accommodation is straightforward and well solved. Very quiet house and surroundings. The rooms are very clean. The bathroom has everything you need for showering. The only criticism I have is that in the bathroom for bedroom 1&2 the shower spray is not suitable for washing out shampooed hair with long hair.
All around Sharon is a very good hostess. Always happy to return."

Stayed one night","Sharon's place is lovely and so is she. If you love living rural, as I do, this is the place for you! Light sleepers should know that this room is next to a door used by several guests and the kitchenette, which was used early and late during my stay. I'm mostly camping on this trip, so I was happy that the room was cool--and I had the gear for it. Travelers who prefer more balmy temps might want to schedule a summer stay: this room was noticeably cooler than down the hall where the thermometer said 65. The main part of the house, where other Airbnb rooms are, seemed cozy when I stuck my head in to say so long, but I heard a guest who stayed there say that it was cold."

I ended up checking my email and corresponding with people from the table in the kitchenette. Thank you again for an awesome stay!

Stayed one night","Anthony is a wonderful host; he's quick to respond and give good suggestions, if asked.
His property sits on a quiet neibourhood. It's comfortable for two people on a short stay and has an exquisit decoration. The unit is clean, organized, and well equipped.
When going to bed, since there is only one mini split on the main area, I'd recommend leaving the bedroom's door wide open for the room to remain cool throughout the night. Also, if you're like us, you may find that the mattress is too soft and becomes too hot while sleeping.
Thank you, Anthony, for letting us to stay at your cute bungalow. I wouldn't hesitate to reserve it if going back for a short trip."

Stayed a few nights","We had a really nice stay in this cozy bungalow! It’s such a beautiful place, very welcoming and offers everything you need - even for cooking and had a washing machine (very helpful on longer road trips).
The communication with Anthony was easy and ideal. We didn’t get to know each other in person (and that is the only thing that I personally would criticize)."

The surroundings are very peaceful and full of nature and close to everything. The patio area is a great plus and a great place to relax while looking at the neighborhood. I highly recommend staying at his bungalow, and I assure you that you will have an incredible experience!"

Stayed a few nights",I cannot say enough great things about Anthony’s cottage! It was well appointed and felt like home! It was perfect! You have access to a full kitchen and it is located in a very quiet area. The cottage was fantastic and perfect for two people! It is super close to midtown and downtown Mobile. You have lots of options for food and shopping as it is just 2 miles from the malls on Airport and just 3 miles from restaurants downtown. I highly recommend Anthony’s listings!

Stayed with a pet","We stayed here on a cross-country road trip and arrived well past sunset. The place was easy to locate and offered a nice, clean place to sleep along our route. Anthony was very responsive and upon learning a neighborhood dog running loose ate my shoes, refunded the cost it will be to replace them. The yard should be fenced in at some point per Anthony, so future unwanted visitors to the property should end. I appreciated how clean the house was!"
