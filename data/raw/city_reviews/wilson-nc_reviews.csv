Group trip","The house was amazing and beautiful exactly as described, we did have some issues though. There was a cockroach in the bathr room, I found an ant in the bed I was sleeping in and woke up with 2 bug bites on my legs, and the bathroom door in the master bedroom
made a very loud squeaking noise whenever it was opened and closed. But over all the house was beautiful and very fun and open, this review is just serving as constructive criticism for the owner."

Stayed one night","I loved the carriage house on Necho’s property! It was quiet, beautiful and spacious. The porch was a lovely spot to sit in the evening and the morning. I was visiting Wilson without a car and enjoyed the house’s proximity to the amenities of downtown: I was able to easily walk to restaurants, shops, and the whirligig park. Necho was proactive and communicative through the entire process. I would highly recommend this property to anyone. Thanks for the wonderful visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved, loved, loved staying at Necho's Carriage House! We could not believe how spacious it was!!!
It was so pretty ( we loved all the antiques, beautiful floors, historic vibe etc)... the bed we chose to sleep in....there are 4(!!!)....2 in each very large room...was the beautiful brass & iron white king sized bed. SO COMFORTABLE...slept like babies ( we are seniors lol). We've stayed in hotels in Wilson but really wanted to be downtown....so finding this gem was a dream come true. It's more like staying in your or a friend's home & so quiet & private. The parking is a dream....right smack there at front porch etc. Maybe a 2 min drive at most to downtown which is exactly what we wanted...definitely walkable too ( I would probably only walk while daylight). There's not a kitchen but this is clearly specified in description. There is a small fridge, coffee maker & microwave which was just fine for us. We can't say enough good things except we definitely hope to be back SOON!"

They’ve been everything we’ve wanted when visiting family and enjoying the unbelievable food next door at the Western Sizzlin. Walkable to the library if I want a different place to work, but internet and work tables are very convenient in the house. I heartily recommend, but stop reserving it when we want it! :)"

The space was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, there was a noticeable odor of cat pee throughout the residence. The rooms were also used for storage, so there was some clutter and the provided towels and washcloths were mismatches, worn, and threadbare."

Stayed one night","Necho’s Carriage House was the absolute cutest! My mother and I were only there one night but would have easily stayed a week. The furniture was gorgeous, well cared for and time period appropriate. I didn’t realize before going that this was previously an Inn and a historical location! That’s totally up my ally and we reveled in it. I only wish I could have learned more about the location honestly!
There were some festive decorations which were a nice touch, everything was extremely clean which I appreciated and the beds were comfortable. We would absolutely stay again. Necho was also very proactive on communication."

Stayed one night","The Rosebud carriage house is a lovely two-bedroom unit, with one set up as the main bedroom and the second with a dining or game area, small refrigerator, tv, and comfy seating. Each has a full bathroom. Both are furnished throughout with comfortable period pieces. The host thoughtfully has plexiglass over the tops of most, so no worries about placing your toiletries, etc. It was just as described in the listing and even better in person. Communications with Necho were easy and timely. We would definitely come back again.
The check-in process was seamless with the key in a lock box. Rosebud is part of a small compound of historic units in a historic neighborhood of Wilson with off street parking right in front, making it very easy to unload the car. There’s a front porch and in early June, jasmine bushes were blooming scenting the night air. Downtown is a thirteen minute walk. It’s a town center making a comeback and if you can’t find what you’re looking for there, there’s plenty of malls for shopping and dining on the way in from I95.
We enjoyed learning about Wilson and staying in this very comfortable and welcoming property."

Stayed with kids","This is our go to place whenever we need a local Airbnb! We always, always, always check out the availability here first. The house is beautifully decorated, there is plenty of space for two people or eight. The exterior of the home looks nice and offers an area for your pets and/or children to play in a safe, enclosed area. We absolutely wish we could keep this place our little secret (to increase the availability for us) but we love to tell others how much we love it here when in town!"

Overall a nice quite place to stay while visiting family in the area. Lots of room. We will be back."

Stayed with a pet","This place is great! I was traveling with my mom and two dogs.
Pros: The fenced in yard is absolutely perfect, and in great condition. The yard is big, and very enjoyable. There’s no neighbors close by so everything felt very private, which we loved.
This is definitely a home in a very country setting, so if you’re looking for a lot of amenities near by, you will have to travel about 10 minutes or so.
Loved that we could use the garage attached to the house, and the house was large and spacious!
Cons: the door to the back yard locks when you close it. You also use a key to enter through the front door as opposed to a key pad. This caused us a bit of trouble, as we had the key on the kitchen counter, and went out back to enjoy the yard and closed the door behind us, locking us out of the house. The host was very helpful though and came right away to let us back in. The upstairs bedrooms while lovely, I do not think are air conditioned.
Would stay again 100%"

We wish that there were instructions as to how to use the fireplace and I think that it would be a good idea to leave that information for the next guests.
The bed was so comfortable! We will definitely be back when we visit my sister again."

Stayed one night","House is pretty big. It just wasn’t homie so to speak. There was no coffee. The alarm was beeping for the door and a smoke detector battery was chirping. There is not much good cooking gear and the shelves are pretty bare.
If the owner does a few things inside to create more of a theme it could be great.
The old country road is fine but unremarkable.
This was a fine place for two of us to stay overnight but just pretty blah and ordinary otherwise.
It’s a 4 for me for sure but not a 5."

Stayed one night","Gracie and Pedro’s place is an authentic little horse and cattle ranch convenient to 95 and Rocky Mount. Off the beaten path and nestled in Elm City, North Carolina, this little slice of heaven was the perfect place to lay our heads for the night. The sun setting through the trees bid us good night and the same sun rising over the ranch welcomed us the next morning.
The bunkhouse itself was comfortable and clean. There was a queen bed and two bunkbeds so it would accommodate a family nicely. The bunkhouse was equipped with a small refrigerator, microwave and a Keurig. That was more than enough to get us started and back on the road.
Highly recommend!"

Everyone was so nice, and my grandsons loved taking a riding lesson. The inside of the bunkhouse was very comfortable. The mattress was one of the best I’ve slept on. I can’t speak for the bunks. The only thing that would have been a help would be disposable eating utensils and paper plates since there is no real kitchen."

I just checked the property before walking my dog from the cabin to our vehicle and had no trouble. Over all good experience.

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I, along with our two dogs, stayed at the ranch for a couple nights before heading to the beach. Gracie was responsive and kind during all interactions we had with her. She was flexible with various aspects of the booking and later, the check in process. When she says make yourself at home, she means it! Her husband, Pedro, was welcoming and kind also. He was responsive and engaging when we asked questions about many things ranchy. We especially enjoyed watching Gracie and Pedro team up during the cattle sorting event! 🤠
The bunkhouse is exactly as shown in the photos. There was plenty of room for our two dog cages to easily fit. We enjoyed seeing horses, cattle, roosters and dogs going about their daily life. Mother Nature’s finest right outside your door!
Overall, our bunkhouse stay was relaxing, a breath or fresh air, and just what we needed!
Thanks to Gracie and Pedro for sharing their beautiful ranch!!! See ya next time! ❤️🤠"

There was a coffee machine for the morning and fridge/freezer to use. It was a bit cold when we stayed and unfortunately the little space heater couldn't really keep up. If it's looking like it might be on the cold side during your travel, maybe bring an extra blanket :)"

I loved how the bathroom was spacious and clean when we got there! My favorite thing about the bunkhouse was how cozy it was! We did not realize there was no wifi when booking but we brought so many card games that we did not even care about that in the end! The host was awesome about responding and had our well-being in priority mode from check-in to check-out. Definitely will recommend in the future!

Stayed one night","Absouletly loved our stay at this bunkhouse! We only needed a place to shower and sleep for one night and Gracie's place met all our needs. We had someone in our group with limited mobility and although the place isn't designed with disabled people in mind there weren't too many obstacles that we couldn't overcome (but I would caution that won't be the case for everyone). We very much enjoyed watching the horses and wished we could have stayed longer to get a riding lesson. The location was a little too far off I-95 for our liking but the farm/ranch is just so charming that we weren't that mad about it. We checked-in by just walking in (same for checking out) and if you're the type that prefers to keep to yourself, we were never bothered by anyone. The bedding was comfortable (very soft!) and cute especially the llama sheet set. There were plenty of towels readily available and small bottles of shampoo and soap to use. There is no dedicated kitchen but the small fridge, microwave, and k-cup coffee were enough for our needs. Disposable cups and cutlery were available but you'll have to bring plates. The bunkhouse does have a rustic appearance but it's very clean! All in all we have no real complaints and think most people would enjoy staying at this bunkhouse."

Beds were comfortable and bathroom & shower were fine too.
Cool pictures of the ranch and rodeo events hanging throughout the interior.

Stayed with a pet","Thanks is not enough for Gracie and her entire crew at the ranch for the AWESOME food recommendations, the wonderful place to stay, the hospitality, and the overall experience of our stay. We are truly grateful, and will DEFINITELY stay there again on our way through, or maybe even for a short getaway! Everything in the description is 100% accurate, the bunkhouse would be awesome to bring a few kids along for the weekend, and to give them a bit of a ranch exposure. Gracies's dogs all got along so well with our 100 pound American Bulldog, who is usually a bit shy around new dogs, but well-socialized at the local dog parks. They ran around for a bit, and it was great to see her have a bit of freedom. The driveway is long and off the road, so your stay is very quiet, and well groomed (one of our vehicles is a low Corvette and DIDN""T DRAG the air splitter NOT ONE BIT!!!!) for any ride. The bed was very comfortable, and the very hot shower felt great after a long day on the road. This is EASILY one of the BEST AirBnB places we have stayed. Thank you!"

The nearest town is about a 15 minute drive away. The farm is beautiful and well maintained. I wish we would have been able to enjoy some time with the horses, but we were only there for a quick overnight stay. The bunkhouse itself has a funny smell possibly from the older furniture that is in it. It is definitely clean, but has that 'old furniture' smell I have found at a few Airbnb's."

Group trip","It was a very nice historical old house. We really loved the house. It just needs a lot of love and attention. I couldn’t give a 5. The outside needed a lot of attention. Litter on the grounds, broken boards on a porch. The front door was unable to be used, the doorknob was about to fall off. One of the downstairs bedrooms needed cleaning behind doors (when going to close the door there was a lot of dust and looked like chipped paint on the floor); several lamps needed bulbs or extension cords; back entryway light is out. Windows were hard to see through.
Love and attention would make this such a more beautiful house. Overall it was a great place for us to stay. And we would return. We loved that the Christmas tree was still up. And some of the outside lights on the shrubs worked, but not all of them."

Stayed with a pet","This is a historic house turned into an Airbnb rental. It is like staying in George Washington's house. The place is comfortable for a large party. It has antique furniture, original hard floors, and woodwork which we appreciated. What made us not to give it a 5 star is the condition of the front yard-- broken branches and litter made a bad impression. Windows were covered with dust and while we know those are old and hard to clean, we would have liked to see them clean. The overall cleanliness of the place was good. Other things to note were the broken dishwasher and malfunctioning shower head in one of the bathrooms which we let the host know. Also, some of the lamps needed either bulbs or extension cords to be able to plug them in. We let the host know of it. Otherwise the house had several grand chandeliers working. We loved the house but left it with the feeling that it needed a bit more love and care. Communication with the host was fast. He was flexible with check-in/out."

I highly recommend this gorgeous home, we had the most relaxing time on a busy weekend. We hope to have the opportunity to come back.
A big thank you to our host and for making us feel so welcomed and right at home. Five stars plus for this stay."

Stayed with kids","This house is so worth visiting the town of Wilson. It is beautiful and was beyond comfortable for our family of 10. Almost like stepping back in time to a wonderful old southern “mansion.” So many rooms and a huge kitchen that made us all feel so much at home. We were traveling for our son’s graduation and Necho even left a Congratulations card and balloons at the house on the day of graduation. Such a nice thought. He was extremely responsive and always answered quickly. My father-in-law is in a wheelchair, but it was not too difficult to get him in and out of the house. Just a short step to enter the house and was able to maneuver him in the wheelchair.
I would love to visit the house again. The town is so welcoming and the restaurants are great. You should plan a destination retreat to this beautiful home."

Easy instructions to get into the house and check out.
I addressed the cleanliness of the house with the host and he said he would talk to the cleaning crew. The cleanliness was a major concern with my family. I feel if this is addressed this house would be the best stay for families for the amazing price."

He is very responsive and attentive to his guests needs as well as providing local recommendations. When renting this home remember it’s an old home, which means its got its quirks and is in a constant process of restoration, but its irreplaceable charm can’t be beat by any ordinary rental. A huge selling point for us was having a bathroom to each bedroom! Staying in this home gives you such a unique experience that you rarely find for such a reasonable price.

Group trip","This is a majestic, comfortable old home that has amazing high ceilings, fire-places in almost every room, and gorgeous wood floors and details everywhere. The kitchen is large and would be easy to cook in, although we didn't have time to cook while we were there. The location couldn't be more centrally located in Wilson- right around the corner from the University. If you need to stay in the area, this is a way to do it while also feeling you are stepping back in time with all the comforts and space you could possibly need. If you need a central area to watch tv or movies as a group comfortably this could be the only drawback of the layout I can think of- all the televisions are in bedrooms, except for one which is in a sitting room that has table-seating only. Maybe some moving of furniture could remedy that, though? I do highly recommend this property. The owner was very responsive and seemed to truly care about us having a wonderful stay."

Group trip","Our family (nine members) stayed 2 nights at the Enchanted Estate during the holiday weekend.

We are extremely appreciative to Necho for allowing us to modify our booking without penalty and also allowing us a late check out! Necho (Host) was very responsive and super friendly. We booked the entire home and the pricing was great for 3 nights. The estate is historic, quaint with plenty of natural sunlight and location is nice with ample parking.

The rooms are very spacious, each with queen size beds and an adjoining bathroom for each room. We had a full kitchen, with plenty of space which included stove top, fridge, cooking utensils, pots and pans. Simple things like paper towels, cleaning products were readily available and it was really nice to be able to cook meals.
There were several housekeeping issues we had to address during our stay. The water temperature in the showers could have been hotter, as the water was cold after several showers were taken. But this wasn't a deal breaker. However, the property was not thoroughly cleaned as we expected and everyone had different experience. We contacted Necho immediately and we were very impressed with his understanding and attentiveness to our concerns due to the COVID pandemic. He was very apologetic and shared his dilemma with keeping housekeeping staff due to COVID. He immediately addressed and went above and beyond to rectify our issues. He also agreed to move us to an adjacent property to ensure we were comfortable. We really appreciated the quick response and customer service provided.
Necho also provided us a personal tour of the adjacent four properties which will be undergoing renovations. It was very nice to be able to wander into each room of each home. We were able to see some very interesting architectural features of the homes.
The property has some nice spaces, but could use a little more TLC to be awesome. But it's still a great place! It will more appealing once the major upgrades and renovations are completed. Our family will consider having next year’s family reunion onsite. Overall, I would recommend/stay again once all renovations are completed."

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely fabulous Airbnb! We loved it so much that we were torn between spending time out of the Airbnb vs. in the adorable town. Fortunately, it rained quite a bit and our outdoor plans were shuttered so it allowed us to spend some cozy time in the loft. The design, art and book selection(oh my!) were all top notch. I initially thought it was overpriced, but after the stay, I was glad I’d paid a premium for such a premium experience. We’ll be back, for sure! One of our new favorite places!"

We wanted to explore downtown Wilson and the loft was in walking distance of art galleries, museums, restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and the acclaimed Vollis Simpson Whirlygig Park and museum. Barb, out host, was incredibly warm, friendly and helpful. She was quick to answer any question I had and helped to make our trip even more special. I would recommend this location to anyone planning to travel to the area. You will not be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the second of many stays that I have planned at the Loft. This time the children (12 and 24) came along who decided that The Loft is ""one of their favorites"".
Although it rained the entire stay, the atmosphere and set up at the loft made way for a ""family art jam session"", family spa day, games, reading, journaling and plenty of good food choices.
I appreciate that my second tour at the art gallery downstairs (The Edge) was ""different and yet the same"". The new upstairs exhibit included a ""red rock theme"". Sebastian's musical /pop art downstairs is timeless.
I highly recommend a stay at The Loft for outstanding host(s)/hospitality. Other experiences include: The Artisan Farmer's Market, different art galleries, museums, small town spa, food trucks, good food and friendly people."

Stayed a few nights","My stay at The Loft was 10 stars!
From beginning to end, Barbara was ""the hostess with the mostest"".....she genuinely cares about providing a space that fits the needs of her guest, so much so she/Sebastian purchased a blender for my visit.
Out of every place that I have stayed, this one is top notch special. The decor, furnishings, amenities, books, art, activities, cleanliness and fresh smell set a high bar within the industry.
It felt as if I was staying at an ""art-spa hotel"" with a personal concierge included.
All of this yet with a ""small town-at home"" feel.

I was granted an early arrival for the local Artisan Farmer's Market which was also a wonderful experience. The local shops and food are also great. The people and hospitality add to what makes this place a ""hidden gem"".
The Edge Gallery (below The Loft) is a must see. Whether you're an ""artsy"" or not Sebastian's work is AMAZING!
I will most certainly share my experience as well as return with family and friends."

Thank you so much to Barb and your partner for giving us a tour of your gallery. It made me want to come back to visit! The coffee shop next door was fantastic and very convenient. I took a short walk around town before we left and it felt like such a special undiscovered town. Thank you again for everything!!

Stayed a few nights","We recently had the pleasure of staying here and it was hands down the best Airbnb experience ever. The loft was incredibly stylish and beautifully decorated, with a mix of modern and vintage furnishings that made it feel like a home away from home. Barbara and Sebastian were the perfect hosts - extremely knowledgeable about the area, friendly, and accommodating . They were able to recommend great places to eat and drink, and even gave us a tour of their art gallery, The Edge, where I ended up buying a piece of art to remind me of our stay. The location of the loft is perfect - it’s in a quaint town with a charming bakery next door which was a perfect place for a cup of coffee and light breakfast. Barbara and Sebastian were so welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience. We loved it so much we ordered take out and made cocktails in the loft so we didn’t have to leave! 10/10"

An NYC style open loft with new and old style touches made this place absolutely amazing.
Located downtown, it is ideally located around some great local businesses such as Tig’s Courtyard and Treat Yo’ Self Bakery just to name a few and 2 blocks from the great Whirligig Park. Within a mile of the Barton College Campus this is a must stay."

Stayed a few nights","Treat yourself to a one of a kind experience in a beautifully designed, peaceful and restorative space in the loft above “ The Edge”, an art gallery in downtown Wilson, NC.
This rural, formerly bustling, tobacco town, is undergoing a metamorphosis into an artist enclave filled with positive energy.
The loft is full of light and spaces to sit and enjoy each other. My sister’s and I (3 of us) spent a long weekend just soaking in the pleasure of being together. The loft has everything that you need and is in walking distance to the Vollis Simpson Whirligig Park and many cool art galleries, the Wilson Arboretum and the Wilson Rose Garden. There is an amazing bakery Treat Yo Self (with a pink roof) about a block away from the Whirleygigs that I am willing to drive from Cary for their wonderful treats.
Barb is a 5 star hostess and will enthusiastically guide you to the wonders that Wilson has to offer. She is an amazing artist and we all left with a piece of her art to cherish as we remember our time together.
Be a part of the transformation of this formerly forgotten town into a spectacular destination for everyone. All it takes is viewing the potential of the town with a positive attitude and absorbing the energy of those with a creative vision. We loved our stay at Barb’s loft and could not have been more pleased that we found it on airbnb. A true delight."

Stayed a few nights","The loft was as advertised and provided an ideal place to stay for a brief visit (two nights) to attend some Wilson Tobs baseball games. The location was very convenient to the ball park, just minutes away and was within short walking distance to a nice coffee shop and a few pubs. Communication with the host Barbara was efficient and quick and although we didn't need anything, I felt confident that Barbara would have helped in a timely manner. As to the loft, it is just very comfortable. There are several clutches of chairs, sofas, and tables where we were able to chat and socialize very comfortably. The beds are VERY comfortable - had two very restful nights. I will definitely plan to stay at the loft again. While more expensive than a chain hotel for just two people, the comfort and home-like feeling is so much worth the greater expense. Simply, a very easy and relaxing experience."

The beds are INCREDIBLY comfortable and were just what we needed after a long day of flying and driving. On top of everything else, it was a real pleasure to meet Barb. She was a perfect host, greeting us when we arrived to show us up to the flat, offering great tips for things to do / see / eat in Wilson, and educating us about this very sweet and welcoming town.

Stayed one night","Barbara has lovingly created a beautiful space that we felt at home the moment we walked in. The loft is bright and airy, with an inviting warmth that’s tastefully appointed with soft textures, comfortable furniture and art she’s either collected or created. The windows and the skylights let in so much natural light and with the cross breeze on a beautiful day, it was perfect to lounge and take in the space, while reading one of the books from her curated library. Barbara was a gracious host, answering all our questions and taking the time to show us all around the loft and introduce us to Wilson. It was an excellent and refreshing way to celebrate not only my 30th Birthday but our first trip away post-quarantine. She should be very proud of the place she’s so thoughtfully created & we highly recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere very special."

Stayed one night","We absolutely loved everything about our stay in Barbara's loft! Spaces this unique, beautiful & comfy are few and far between - we were grateful to add it as a stop while traveling from VA to SC, and so happy that Barbara has chosen to share it with others. The loft is super clean and the light that filters in through all of the windows and reflects off of the white brick walls is so gorgeous that I kept taking photos. You can see the care put into every design choice from the thick marble kitchen counters to the salvaged building wood made into long rustic tables to the open shower and vessel tub in the bathroom. The decorating is so comfortable - deep, inviting sofas facing one another, a pillowy soft duvet on the bed, welcoming deep armchairs for reading, etc. Barbara recommended Varee nearby where we picked up delicious sushi to enjoy in the loft, then we walked two doors down to Tig's to grab breakfast & coffee in the morning. So worth a visit if you love historic, artistic spaces!"

Stayed a few nights","I couldn’t have been more charmed by the space, the host or the town! The Loft is fantastic — somehow even bigger and more beautiful than the pictures. Immaculately clean. The bathtub is where I would have spent the entire trip, but there was so much within walking distance that I had to go outside some. (That Whirligig Park is after my heart!) My partner is six and a half feet tall and could still enjoy the rain shower (a rarity). I know this is probably irrelevant to the big picture, but the towels were made of the softest and nicest smelling fabric i’ve ever touched — such a luxurious touch. Barb is the perfect host; she adds those luxurious and delightful touches everywhere. She stocks the bathroom with quality products and the kitchen with essentials, including several coffee & tea options. She even brought us oat creamer when she found out we don’t drink milk. She left us to our own after a quick & useful tour, but engaged when we initiated. Her recommendations for dining & activities were spot-on. The little town of Wilson has multiple art galleries within walking distance, and she pointed us to them all. Barb’s gallery (located downstairs) was the best, of course. But my favorite pieces of art were decorating the Loft.
You shouldn’t trust a review that only gushes, so I’ve tried hard to come up with a negative. All I can muster is that the blinds don’t fully block out light. Personally, i enjoy waking up with the sun and appreciate the amazing natural light. But if you want to sleep-in or take a day-nap in the dark, bring an eye mask. Also be aware (which Barb will remind you) that nearly every Downtown business is closed on Sundays. You’ll have to plan ahead with groceries, or be willing to drive 10 minutes to find an open restaurant."

My partner joked that if we closed the shades, we could tell people we were in Manhattan and they’d never know. Our night in the loft was perfect and we had everything we needed. We were located a short walk (2 blocks) from local restaurants and a very neat brewery. We spent our evening there and then came back to the loft for drinks and relaxation. We didn’t have a need for the second bed, but noticed they were situated for optimal comfort and privacy. The queen bed has a privacy shade that you can draw and the king bed was situated on the opposite side of the room. I can’t say enough nice things about the stay, especially Barb! She showed us around and was very kind and efficient. She clearly loves her space and wants others to enjoy it as well. We will definitely be back!"

OMG, this place is HEAVEN! From the quaint surroundings to the beautiful decor to the hidden treasures. I am here on business, but will be coming back to visit his property again very soon! I've been so busy with work, I didn't get a chance to just sit and enjoy the house. The only drawback was that the washer and dryer were a little outdated, but even so, they did their job :) I promise, if you stay here, stay one more day than you intended. You won't be sorry!
This home is suitable for a large group traveling, and would even be a perfect place for generational family members to gather and enjoy themselves. There are lots of things for the kids to walk to and have fun exploring about.
Necho is amazing! We came in late night during a really bad storm and he was kind enough to ensure a few lights were left on to guide our way. Seriously, no complaints from me...well, maybe one. I wish I could've stayed longer and enjoyed some more of both his home and this cute little town."

The house itself is beautiful and Necho was nice enough to give us a tour of the other air bnbs available at the same location too! The front porch of our house was perfect for sitting down to catch up with old friends or just enjoy the fresh air. The neighborhood was nice and quiet for our whole 5 day stay there. The house was clean and neat, everything was obviously well taken care of. I really have no complaints at all. We will be back again asap and I think anyone would love this place. Book now and thank me later!"

Off the main road and tucked into a private lot, plenty of parking. Safe and easy check-in. 4 mins from Brentwood and 2 mins from downtown Wilson. If we had bikes we could’ve ridden them tot he whirligig park! Clean kitchen, good water pressure, and plenty of towels/blankets. Be wary - the door locks every time it is closed and the oven is locked so you can’t use it, but our stay was great! Necho was extremely responsive and welcoming."

Stayed a few nights","This was my great grandparents’ house, so spending a few nights there proved an excellent way to reconnect with my past.
The house is spacious, with 12 foot ceilings and comfortable furnishings from many periods. Given that it dates back nearly 125 years, the mixture of vintage charm and modern comfort is just about right It was easy walking distance to downtown Wilson, where we attended the Eyes on Main Street photography festival and enjoyed its reborn nightlife. Ample, well maintained parking and well tended grounds were a plus; we were able to socialize with the guests from the other cottages on the property.
Necho was instantly responsive. The couple who stayed with me definitely wants to return next year when we attend the festival again."

Group trip","Beautiful old southern home in rural Wilson. The home was comfortable and I felt right at home. It was quiet at night and we got a good night sleep. They could have done a much better job cleaning. We were given one towel each for face and body which was very thin and falling apart. There were
cobwebs on the ceiling and there was black soot everywhere. My feet got black walking on the floor without shoes.
Necho was a great host and was accommodating to our early check in and difficulty accessing wifi. He was very friendly. All in all we had a good stay."

It could be a great place to have a family reunion or get together with friends.
Necho was truly one of the best hosts we have dealt with on Airbnb and we appreciated all he did to be so hospitable."

We ourselves would like to reserve the cottage in the back for our stay for that event for 3 nights. Thank you for hosting us.

We didn't use the televisions, but the table was perfect to work and play at, and the kitchen met all of our needs. The place was very clean and well-maintained. We were finishing up cleaning out grandmother's home of 40 years after she moved out of it, and it was a nice, convenient place to relax, and near our favorite family restaurant (Western Sizzlin, the best in Wilson!).
We got to talk to Necho afterwards and he told us some of the history of the homes. A VERY comfortable and enjoyable place to stay for our family!"

You will be only minutes from the one of a kind Vollis Simpson Whirlygig Park and museum. There are art galleries galore and a brewery right at the park with food trucks. A short block from the park is “ Treat Yo Self” bakery and you don’t want to miss that! We had a great weekend and the house provided the perfect home base.

Stayed with kids","Overall the stay was honestly just OK. There were several issues, some of which I would typically brush off, but all combined made the stay just OK. First, there was a lack of kitchen cookware (no pots, just pans) and some of it was dirty and/or rusty. Not all of the silverware was clean. Each bed only had 1 towel (including the King size and double bed) so I had to ask for more and find them. There were no hand towels at all. The instructions for check out say to leave dishes in the dishwasher which does not exist. Finally, there appeared to be animal hair on the sheets.
Aside from that, it’s a solid 15 min off the highway for those traveling. Not a reason I deducted stars, just something to note. I personally didn’t love the overall feel of the place, but that’s just my preference. The photos are accurate. There isn’t a cozy living room which was something I definitely missed but again did not deduct stars for, as it was shown accurately."

Stayed one night","What a delightful find! The place is decorated lovely to the Victorian period bc the actual house was constructed in 1900. The house is situated in A lovely little grouping of charming historic homes. They even had a Christmas tree n the sitting room, what a lovely surprise. Another big plus is every bedroom had its own full bath...Necho as a host was so gracious. We needed a place to stay at a very short notice and he was so accommodating. When you stay there you have to check out the whirligig park!"

Stayed one night","Necho's home was great! We were in town for a tennis tournament, and it was a perfect place for us to regroup after matches and get some much-needed sleep before the next day's activities. Spacious bedrooms and sitting room gave us plenty of room to stretch out and relax. Bathrooms in every bedroom are a huge plus. We made use of the outside picnic tables for dinner one evening. It is super-convenient to downtown Wilson, and in general was very drivable to all of our match locations in surrounding towns. If we're fortunate enough to make the tournament next year, we'll definitely try to book his place again! Necho was great. We got the chance to meet him while we were there, as he was doing some work on a nearby property, and he was a joy to talk to. We wish him the best, and would gladly stay in one of his properties again!"

Stayed one night","Meika’s place was great and she was a wonderful host. I was on a road trip and her place was a perfect stopping point for me. I booked that morning and asked Meika if I could have early check in due to a work call. She was super flexible and generous, even letting me know that if the room wasn’t ready before my call, that she would provide a different space.
About the pool house—it’s a lovely little studio behind the pool. There are people working around the property who will say hello during the day. My impression was that they will speak with you as little or as much as you want. Definitely more friendly than us Northeast city people!
People bringing dogs—Meika and Josh have a sweet goldendoodle who loves to say hello. He has full off-leash access to the property and there are also other dogs potentially off-leash on property who may have different temperaments, so just something to note depending on your own dog’s temperament.
Overall great experience. Thank you Meika & Josh!"

Stayed with a pet","What a terrific AirBnB experience! Gracious hosts with an absolutely beautiful AirBnB property! Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by Josh and his Doodle dog as well as a Harvest Host guest who was also staying on property! What a terrific welcome! Our pool house accommodations were perfect! Spacious kitchenette area (with a fantastic countertop oven/airfryer), comfortable bed, large walk-in shower with a separate toilet area. We had more than enough room for our bags as well as ample space for our two large dogs and their beds. Everything was absolutely spotless! Honestly, this space reminded me of a perfectly appointed studio flat. We loved it!
After we were settled, Josh and Meika gave us a wonderful tour of the historic house and grounds. Their talented son also gave us a mini piano concert! Wow! As an endurance athlete, I was grateful for the use of the gym house's treadmill for my morning run. There is also have a bowflex machine and inversion table for those who might be interested.
As this property is on our travel route when visiting family in the Northeast, we will most definitely return... next time as Harvest Host guests in our Airstream. Highly recommended! Thanks so much, Josh & Meika!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute little pool house, contains most things you need. Missing a few basic comforts like some decent towels, extra blanket/pillows, hand towel by the bathroom sink. Cleanliness wasn’t great either - things like floors, window sills, and appliance handles were dirty or only partially cleaned. The pool house also had a significant fly and bug problem while I was there causing me to have to spend more time fly swatting than relaxing while inside.
Also, and this is mostly for single women or the antisocial among us: the host Josh is VERY around and talkative. Expect to bump into him a lot. Certainly made me a little uncomfortable at times. I only saw Meika from a distance once.
To end things on a positive note: they were fast to respond to my messages, the internet is decent, the pool is nice to cool off in, parking is ample, the location is convenient, quiet, and beautiful, and they have an adorable friendly dog."

Stayed over a week","If your looking to stay in not only a quiet, spacious and comfortable place but also luxurious with amazing views, then I highly recommend booking with Meika and Her husband Josh! We traveled 19 hours from Texas and this was nothing short of home away from home! We can’t wait to come back and visit! -Ronnie
As a travel nurse, wife and Mom of 3 girls, traveling so far away can be so daunting and overwhelming to say the least, but Meika and her family were so inviting, loving and did so much to compromise with the needs for my stay! Coming from Texas, being outside of the City limits and in a country setting while ALSO having all the bells and whistles, POOLSIDE 😍 and still being provided with a warm-bright, and oh so comfortable place to lie my head at night made my heart and mind feel so much more at ease! Not only did Meika and her husband provide me with a peaceful and updated pool house stay, but they provided me a sense of safety without evening knowing it! They are also set up with state of the art security surveillance systems and with a pretty sweet Wi-fi set up to too, which I know Josh is proud of, as well as his lights show! Lol p.s. thank you for keeping my hubby entertained while he was there and also for not using your bad boys alarm warning on me!! 😂 ❤️ Though I would have loved to have stayed longer, I am forever grateful for the kindness, and understanding you gave to me from start to finish, even when I could have expressed it more during my stay. You truly blessed me, and showed me there are still genuinely good-hearted, loving people left in this world! I know Ronnie would agree when I say this, but our doors are without a doubt always open to your family if you ever find yourself in Texas in the future! We can show you guys around the stockyards, take you to the best Donut spot in Downtown Fort Worth, and bless your family, as you have done for mine. I hope we can all stay in touch in the meantime, my girls are still fully prepared for a trip to NC so they can enjoy your pool, take a visit down to the Outer banks, and of course meet you all! Also, Josie says she is very, very sorry and has now fully committed herself to a window blind free diet from now until forever, and she will definitely miss her newly gained friends from her first, probably last, long distance trip. 😂 Until next time friends! -Tyler and Josie!"

Group trip","This place was spacious and convenient. It was not clean to my standards and had some spiderwebs. My family and I had to go bye some towels, wash cloths and cleaning supplies to make it work for us. At about 3 o’clock in the morning a man came on to the property startling me, saying that he was coming to take out the garbage. I wish that would have been communicated to me. It is very unsettling to be in a foreign place and have to feel like you might have to protect yourself."

Very quiet neighborhood was able to sleep without any disturbances. Close to everything to include grocery stores and restaurants. Plenty of board games for the family to enjoy. Love the decor, lots of natural sunlight and plenty of space to move around. The host Anwur was very responsive and tended to all my needs. The code I received worked so there was no problem getting into the house. The house is fully stock with everything we needed. Plenty of towels, toilet paper, and kitchen items. This place is worth considering if your in Wilson."

The interior was cozy and welcoming, the beds were comfy, and having so many animals nearby was food for the soul.

We loved being greeted by one of the farm cats who was very welcoming! The pillows were comfy and waking to beautiful surroundings was a lovely surprise after arriving at night. The sun on the ranch, horses, cattle, an adorable & friendly goat paired with a hot cup of coffee was perfect. Although our stay was really short, and we had to leave the very next morning, it was the perfect place to lay our heads and have a peaceful sendoff after visiting with the animals. We will certainly come back again during our many trips to and from New Jersey and South Carolina."

Stayed with a pet","The cabin on the farm was the perfect little place for my stayover in my roadtrip from CT to FL. It was late when I arrived and had a little trouble finding the right turn, but that was my own tired eyes not reading the directions clearly the first time. When I arrived, it was pretty dark and I texted Gracie just o make sure I was going to enter the right cabin, since there were 2 buildings. She responded right away. There were free roaming dogs on the property that ran up to my car as I pulled in. I could also hear lots of others barking and howling in the distance. I'm a dog rescue volunteer, and had a rescue dog with me going to his new home in FL. Since I was unsure of how he would be with the farm dogs, I was a little hesitant to get him out of the car until Gracie's dogs wandered off.
The cabin was super cute and the bed was very comfy for my 1 night stay. Had a nice morning waking up to farm animals and walking around the farm."

Stayed with a pet",The cottage is just like pictured and described. It is about 15 miles off Route 95 but arriving and watching the horses makes the extra drive worth it. Also there are no close by restaurants so I would recommend eating before you arrive or get take-out on the way. It was definitely fun watching the farm animals and activities during our stay.

We had a short time with frozen pipes due to the very unusual temp drop, but Gracie did everything possible to make things comfortable for us, including offering a full refund even after staying the first night. (I was visiting family for the holidays, so I really just wanted a quiet and comfortable room to sleep in!). The water was running the next morning, so it really was nothing to get fussed about when the cabin is so comfy and cozy!
It’s very peaceful and all the animals are lovely, so why not stay here on your travels! The stars were also beautiful to see on a clear evening. Gracie is great!"

Stayed with kids","I’ve stayed at countless Airbnbs and have had various experiences but never a nightmare like this! I realize she has good reviews so I don’t know what made my visit so different. If it was the sole fact of her being stressed out because of having a rodeo that night, then she needs to never rent out rooms during events since she was pissed off about having to be a host. But I’ll go chronologically.
Before arriving, she told me there would be a rodeo and if I wanted to attend, to go buy tickets online, which I did. What she didn’t tell me was that the rodeo would be right outside the cabin I would be staying at and I would be watching that rodeo and could watch it from the window whether I wanted to be or not. And could hear it from the speakers blastingly loud from inside the cabin. I say this because if I have been paying for peace and quiet on a farm, I wouldn’t have gotten it, so I don’t think it was fair I had to pay for the rodeo tickets and she should have been upfront about that. I was also not allowed to park near the cabin because the vendors were parked there so I had to park in a huge field and walk far away to get to the cabin. She should have also given me a heads up that would be the situation. Since my journey was part of me moving since I got a new job that needed me to re-locate immediately, I didn’t have an easy overnight bag and I had planned on just grabbing items loosely from the vehicle. And then the fact that it was pouring down rain made going back & forth that far away to the car even more miserable.
There was no key to the cabin and I was worried about leaving my stuff unattended inside with hundreds of people walking around. Her listing had sounded very friendly about calling or texting her or her husband for anything I needed, so I called her just to ask about the key and she acted very frustrated and annoyed and gave me instructions as to where to find one. Well, the key didn’t work. I even recorded a video of me using this key in every direction on both locks on that door to prove it didn’t work. I sent her one simple nice text letting her know the key didn’t work and she never responded.
Since I didn’t want to leave with our stuff in there and I didn’t want to go through the rain to go back to the car to look for something to entertain my six year old with, I started looking around the place. Tons of dead flies on the windowsills. More than could have died and just that one day. But that’s fine. I can deal with that. But then I noticed the lamp on the nightstand had a funnel spider on it near the top where you would need to put your hand. A LIVE funnel spider. I am arachnophobic! I then started to worry and inspect things further. I peeled back the sheets and there were dead bugs and grass in them! The towels were in this little basket and there were dead bugs, hair, and dirt inside the fabric of that basket that could’ve easily been cleaned. maybe 30 minutes had gone by since my last text so I sent another with the pictures, such as of the funnel spider, and told her I was disappointed with finding the bugs in the sheets but that the funnel spider was too much and could somebody please come at least get rid of the spider. Still no response.
The rain started to let up and then there was pounding on the door that was so loud and aggressive both my kid and I jumped and I was scared to answer the door. I honestly pictured there being three angry men outside the door but the pounding wouldn’t stop so I swung the door open from far away and it was her just beating repeatedly on the door as fast as she could with both fists. She immediately started SCREAMING at us at the top of her lungs—like full of utter RAGE! “HOW DARE YOU CONTACT ME DURING AN EVENT! GET OFF MY PROPERTY! I’M CALLING THE POLICE!” My son starts crying and wailing, grabbing stuff off the bed to try to run away from her, telling me to run because she’s going to kill us—-that’s the level of terror she inspired. I was shaking & asked her to please calm down and communicate with me civilly and that she was terrifying my son. “OBVIOUSLY YOU’VE NEVER STAYED ON A FARM! LEAVE NOW!!!! GET OUT!!!!!! THE POLICE ARE COMING!!!” My 6 year old starts screaming that we’re going to jail. She stomps away backwards, screaming and repeating the same things to get off her property and the police are coming, waving her fists around at us.
I reported that I didn’t feel safe to Airbnb support and then called them and they told me not to leave yet. I tried to tell them how scared my son was and I had no idea what the protocol was in a situation like this nor did I know if we’d find anywhere else to stay this late (maybe 8pm by then?). They transferred me to someone else, who also told me not to leave yet and then eventually they said I could go ahead and go and just send them pictures. Unfortunately, their message wouldn’t let me send any of the videos I took.
For the record, my grandparents had a farm (my Dad lives there now) and I have actually LIVED on a farm! But living on a farm doesn’t mean you want to get bit by a spider on your nightstand lamp! Or that you don’t desire"

Stayed one night","Beautiful little cabin on a ranch! Very comfortable bed, has everything you need including coffee in the morning. Active horseback riding/training going on nearby. Wish I had time to book a ride! Only issue I had was the long driveway - it had quite a few ruts/potholes. But it is a ranch, so it’s no problem if you have a truck! Cars need to be cautious especially at night. Overall, I’d stay there again in a heartbeat!"

Stayed one night","The location was perfect, not too far from 95 and just far enough for some quiet. The host was very helpful and answered any questions I had. The cabin was clean. I would recommend it to anyone."

Stayed one night","This place stays booked and I can see why! Great prices, safe location, views for days. I normally stay there but I let my mama stay for a little getaway and she had the best time. I just wish it wouldn’t stay booked all the time so we could stay more often! Selfish, I know."

Stayed one night",Loved every bit of it! The cabin is small and cozy and situated smack in the middle of a working horse and cattle ranch. It was truly a memorable AirBnB experience to picnic under the stars and wake up with the roosters to stroll around the lovely grounds as the horses and cattle get breakfast. Looking forward to returning.
