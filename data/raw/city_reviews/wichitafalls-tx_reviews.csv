Stayed with a pet","We stayed here along our cross country Roadtrip with our 2 dogs! This place was absolutely lovely. It’s tucked into a cute suburban neighborhood that is so peaceful and quiet. The tiny home itself was very beautiful & had everything you could possibly need for your stay. We even cooked our dinner on the stove with the provided kitchenware. Devon is an amazing host, very responsive and attentive.
Don’t forget to say hello to StreetTaco the neighborhood stray kitty :)"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay in a nice and peaceful neighborhood. Guest house was clean, and the amenities were good. I will definitely stay here again when I come back in town. Devon was a great host: friendly, responsive, and easy going.
The only things I'll note that might be an issue for some people are these two things:
- If you use the restroom a lot like I do throughout the night, then you do have to go downstairs to use it. The bedroom is upstairs.
- The shower is small. For me it wasn't an issue, but if you're a person that needs some space to shower, then it'll be a tight squeeze."

Stayed with a pet","Devon was the best & very responsive! The ""Little House"" is super cute and homey! You could see the warm heart of this host in how well she arranged the home. It has a full kitchen, the bathroom was clean, & the bed was comfy. It’s in a great location, very quiet, and peaceful. I was there for an annual dog obedience trial with my English Springer Spaniel and we were very comfortable there. It is perfect for one/two people & one/two pets. The parking is very convenient and getting in is quite easy. I am so glad I found her place and will definitely be back!! :)"

This place is beautiful and was above my expectations. They have a lot of shelving and closet space with different type of uses. The space is very well arranged and it is beautiful. Also, the attention of the host and her father were top-notch. You could see the kindness of this host in how well she arranged the place and the detail to service that I experience you on my arrival after a horrible winter weather drive. After driving 12 hours this was just what I needed. Thank you for your kindness!"

There was a wax warmer plugged in when we arrived that I unplugged immediately and was able to manage through the night, but Devon was kind and accommodating in other ways and I think this is something you could be open with her about. Otherwise no complaints whatsoever!"

If you are an early riser you will get to enjoy many birds cavorting and swooping around the trees in the neighboring yards. I loved the view into all of the neighbors’ yards and got to see a happy little girl swinging in a hammock with her puppy while I was doing my morning Chi Qong exercises in the early morning sun."

Maria has everything you need or could think of including phone chargers in each of the rooms. The beds are comfy and she gives lots of towel linens. The best part is that upon checkout we didn’t have to do anything! Which felt weird so we cleaned up best we could. We will definitely stay at Maria’s place again. I highly recommend staying here.

Location to the university and convenience stores and food was great. The house was very well equipped and we had several large meals with family and friends. Also, very quiet. Maria was more than a super host. We have stayed at Airbnb's all over the world and Maria may be the very best host we have ever had! We would definitely stay here again."

And this comes through in the personality of this comfy, homey, truly amazing Airbnb. You can tell Maria is a thoughtful person in the above and beyond accommodations and thoughtful decorative touches in this Airbnb!
We got in late and easily checked in. There was candy waiting for us, which was an amazing touch after a long trip! We slept in their comfy beds and woke up to a fully stocked coffee station. Enjoyed our coffee on the comfy couch in the peaceful, clean, living room. Gosh, what a lovely respite while we are traveling across the country!
One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. We will definitely be coming back when we come through Wichita Falls again. Thank you!!"

The kitchen was really nice with the beautiful update she had done and had everything you needed. The ac was a godsend in the hot temperatures while we were there. Shannon is a great hostess and responded very quickly to any questions we had. We will definitely stay at Shannon's place again it just felt like home.

Our dog was comfortable there and had a nice completely fenced in backyard so we could let her run free there.
The home was clean and well furnished. Ceiling fans in the living area and all bedrooms were nice. The beds and sheets were super comfortable and cozy!
Shannon was a great host and had a nice home for us to enjoy during our trip."

Stayed with a pet","Shannon was a very responsive and thoughtful host! We had a couple issues with a leaky ceiling and bugs but she was very responsive and fixed or planned to fix the issues. The main space was darker than we like with no lighting overhead. The neighborhood does not have sidewalks for strolls but around the corner is MSU with a great campus to walk through. The mattresses could use some updating, there were foam toppers but we still fell towards the middle of the beds. We did a lot of cooking in the kitchen and found almost everything we needed! The back yard and front porch sitting areas were peaceful!"

The house is super cute, comfortable and well designed. All the appliances were in great working order. The beds and furnishings were very comfortable and good quality. Not sure if Shannon is an Interior Decorator but if she isn't, she should be, the design is very nice and relaxing. Our dog, Oliver, enjoyed the back yard, which has a nice wood privacy fence and lots of trees. Nice patio area to enjoy a glass of wine or coffee while your pet runs around. The TV was easy to use and the kitchen was well stocked. Can't wait to return. Thanks again, Shannon, it was the perfect stay. Appreciate it!"

The most amazing thing about the stay was communication with Shannon. She really always responded very quickly to all the queries and was able to answer any questions we had. Every now and then we also found a little surprise at the door (the banana bread was great!). Shannon was also very flexible when we had to book an additional 2 nights at short notice.

Group trip",AC works great! More than enough kitchen dishes if you plan on cooking. The 3rd bedroom is a little hot due to being an add on...but not horrible. The location is A+ to the town. All in all my family was comfortable and we had a very good time.

Group trip","Shannon's house is wonderful! My family of 6, which includes four children 10 and under, stayed here for 6 weeks this summer. We all had plenty of room and we were very comfortable. The house is in a great location. It is a nice quiet street that is only minutes from everything you would need. Shannon was great too! She went above and beyond when it came to making sure our stay was perfect. When small issues came up, as they do in any house, she addressed them immediately and it was like it never happened at all. Normally being away from home for extended periods of time is stressful, but Shannon made sure this wasn't the case. In addition to the wonderful hospitality, she was also very knowledgeable about the area and recommended many places to us when we asked. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely stay at Shannon's again!"

Stayed a few nights",Setting up our stay and communicating with Shannon was seamless. We were able to get settled without any troubles and the home was set up nicely. Each room and bed were comfortable with nice touches to give a home like vibe during our stay. The kitchen was larger than expected and the backyard had great potential. Although it was very hot once the sun baked it. We enjoyed nice conversation on the patio and porch with multiple outdoor seats and a table.

Stayed with kids",This house was perfect for us and Shannon was amazing. We actually split our time between both this and the Glenwood Haus. the Fain Casa is nicer and in a slightly better neighborhood. Shannon was amazing at working with us as my schedule adjusted twice and we needed to modify dates for our stay. She also was quick to respond to any questions. There was an issue with the freezer and she was there with a replacement in less than 24 hours and even brought us a cooler of ice the same day I notified her. I highly recommend either of the houses and Shannon for your stay in Wichita Falls.

My family and I had a wonderful and very nice stay in Shanoon house. The house is lovely, and even more spacious than we thought (by the photos we saw). Location was good and just 12 minutes to Sheppard AFB, and just 5 minutes driving to the Sikes Senter mall. The house is on a major thoroughfare which made it easy to find but we did not get noise from the street. I'm so great full for how kind that lovely hosts, they were available for any questions I had. The neighborhood was a beautiful and very safe and secure. Close walk to nearby restaurants. We would not hesitate to stay here again. We highly recommend."

The house was very clean and organized, yet cozy and we felt right at home as soon as we walked in. It is nicely furnished and though an older home it has been updated with modern appliances and other touches. Shannon had purchased some food for us which was a nice touch and much appreciated!
The house is well situated being only a few blocks from 3 major thoroughfares and Midwestern State University, yet the neighborhood was very quiet and there was little traffic in the area.
The carport was a great plus since we didn't have to leave the car in the hot sun on an asphalt parking lot at a hotel.

We have received a small impression of life in a Texas town, from the manicured surroundings, the friendly neighbors and what it means to live in a hot and dry country.

It has everything you could need to make yourself at home and brochures on local restaurants and things to do that can make your visit even better. We sometimes forget our toothbrushes and usually have to make a late night run to buy some, because of your thoughtfulness in including toothbrushes in that awesome basket you saved us a trip to buy some. Love that you are always coming up with little ways to make every visit even better. Can't wait to stay on trip number 6.

Shannon was there when we arrived and greeted us with a smile, showed us around the house and then exited with the reminder to contact her if we needed anything.
Wichita Falls is HOT in summer and the central AC was more than adequate. The king bed was firm and the queen soft. There was plenty of seating, and a fully fenced private backyard.
We had a great time there and will definitely be repeated customers of this delightful home in a nice university neighborhood, near everything!"

Stayed a few nights","I know there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" stay but this was about as close as possible. Certainly the closest I have ever experienced. Scot's place was inviting, comfortable, well equipped and most importantly clean. The location was in a Wichita Falls suburb subdivision and felt totally safe. Scot's instructions for entry were simple and spot on. No problems at all! Kitchen, bathroom, laundry, everything was well equipped with plenty of towels, blankets, kitchen utensils. For once we didn't have to run to the store right away for necessities. Speaking of going to the store. A superwalmart is conviently located only about 1/2 mile away. Sweet! If I come bask to Wichitas Falls then Scot's plasce will be my first lookup for availabillity. Scot is a superhost and and see why."

The house has very easy access to the major roads around WF. The two beds are very comfortable and the furniture is clean and comfortable as well. The kitchen is very well stocked for basic cooking. I would definitely stay here again.

Walmart is just down the road as are many convenience stores.
From the off road parking to the quiet and sunny private garden it is all excellent! The laundry, cooking facilities, bathroom, air conditioning & heating, comfortable lounge and bedrooms are all good too!

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay. Really unique location. We were driving from Colorado to Texas and needed a place to stay. A few quick thoughts:
1) Extremely well decorated. No clutter. Minimalistic. Modern.
2) Beds were great. Nice pillow options. High quality memory foam type beds.
3) Unique location. So, so cool to park in what used to be the drive-through teller. Loved that it used to be a bank.
4) Big windows. We love lots of natural light and this delivered.
5) Very downtown feel. But without the complexity of complicated parking. We almost could have fit our 30' travel trailer in the parking lot (although we didn't have it with us).
6) Lots of walkable things. Love that.
7) Kitchen was minimally equipped. Don't expect to cook a Thanksgiving meal but enough for very simple cooking.
8) Loved the sustainable nature of the shampoo and conditioner. Nice little touches."

The space was bright with ambient light, tons of parking, and quiet (even though it was at the intersection of downtown streets). The two rooms were separated by the kitchen/dining/living area which gave great privacy to each guest.
Shea, allowed us to check in early, I did not even have to ask, I only had to notify her of our travel and arrival plans. They were readily accepted when I had to change my dates of travel, and even offered a refund when my new dates were cheaper.
I will deffinatly seek out this location for my future travels to Wichita Falls."

As the listing notes, this converted bank (how cool is that?) is super cozy, well accommodated, and within walking distance of the Multi-Purpose Event Center, along with a ton of excellent restaurants. Seriously, it felt like it was almost too good to be true! Additionally, Cody and Shea, the hosts, were quick to answer any question and provide info and local guidance upon request.

We loved the decor and the natural light in the unit, and found it to be the perfect size for our extended stay. It is easily accessible for someone with a wheelchair or other limited mobility, and was also just a short walk to our favorite coffee shop (8th St. Coffee House).
Cody and Shea were very responsive to our inquiries and all of our interactions were pleasant and polite. They have a real hidden gem here with the Vault.
We enjoyed our stay here very much!"

Stayed a few nights","We've stayed in penthouses, townhouses, condos and luxury apartments since I first started using Airbnb. This has been my favorite. So cute, just enough space for 4 people, no space is wasted. Super quiet (at least over the holidays when we were there), we felt safe the entire time. Plenty of supplies, more than most airbnbs I've rented. The door code didn't work for us at 11:30 p.m. Christmas Eve night but Cody was quick in answering our phone call and we promptly got in, even at that hour. The most original stay we've ever had - a former bank! Very well done, lots of care and thought went into the reno. We will certainly use again. Thank you so much for an unforgettable, comfortable stay for my family during Christmas."

The location is prime with several places to eat and drink within walking or a short driving distance. Cody was very communicative and checked in to make sure everything was good a few times. There are several neat things about this home not to mention, it’s an old bank. Water bottles, coffee, and even a delicious piece of artisan chocolate were available for me. The home was very stylish with good quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash available for use. It took everything in me to not leave with a few of the plants that are used as decoration in the home, but available for purchase! However, I was staying here for work and wouldn’t be able to transport them back! I highly recommend this place! Can’t wait to visit again and check out the other side!"

Stayed a few nights","Nice place with pool (a tad on the cool side) and hot tub. Beds were very comfortable. Best of all was that it was one of the better stocked homes that I have stayed in. Dishes, pots, pans, blender and more! Plenty of washcloths, towels, paper products (except tissue) and extra blankets to snuggle up under while watching TV. I had a very nice stay."

Stayed a few nights","Had a very good stay here. House was clean and in a great location for my short visit. Marilyn was extremely responsive on the few times I reached out to her. It was so hot while I was there so it was nice to be able to cool off in the pool. The pool was a nice size and the only negative thing is that there wasn’t a vacuum so I spent a lot of time skimming it so we could swim. it collected a bunch of leaves and grass and then when the kids would get in it would stir up what was in the bottom of the pool and float to the top. There were several floating devices in the barn which was nice. The bed in the master bedroom is very firm but the other beds in the house are a little softer. Overall, I enjoyed staying at Marilyn’s place and would stay again in the future."

We were so fortunate to have the pool. We swam in it everyday!!!!! It was close to all stores ie. Walmart, Walgreen, and Market Street. When we return to Wichita Falls next summer this will be the first Air bnb that i will check for availability. Thanks again for making our trip relaxing and affordable!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at Marilyn's! The home was clean and comfy and had everything we needed for the week. We loved the pool, and the kids had a ton of fun with the provided pool toys and riding toys in the garage. It was great having garage access due to the heat and storms and there were games and some toys inside for when it was too hot outside. As a parent with small children, having the pool behind a locked gate was a huge plus, and we wouldn't have felt comfortable staying otherwise.
The location felt very peaceful and private and provided easy access to main roads and restaurants, attractions, etc. Marilyn provided easy to understand instructions for check in and out and we appreciated that the required check-out cleaning was minimal. She was very easy to reach when we had questions and was quick to respond. We'd love to stay again if we're ever back in Texas!"

Stayed with kids","The house itself is wonderful. I would suggest the Host add a Nest thermostat to remotely adjust temperature as the house rules of 80 in the summer meant the home did not cool below 78 until after 10pm. Also, being a first time AirBnB customer I had no knowledge base upon which to judge the cleaning fee of $150. After viewing the House rule requirements of guests the amount seems excessive and not in line with comparable AirBnB properties. As for the value, upon reflection a charge of over $600 for one night is a large sum but I was able to spend time with all of my children and grandchildren for the first time in over 2 yrs. My desire to visit with family outweighed my economic sensibilities, so for most people the cost will far outweigh the benefits. As for me, we will go back to a few adjoining suites and pocket the savings."

There was a pack and play for my little one and plenty of games and toys for my toddler. The pool and hot tub were great, clean and safe for kids with the gated yard separating them. This is a great hosting house for families to gather and enjoy time together , will definitely stay again when we go back to see grandpa and grandma."

Both items we had forgotten. The most impressive part of this is the floors. It was spotlessly clean. I was totally comfortable with my baby crawling around. The kitchen has everything you need to make family meals. The wifi and TVs have tons of entertainment options. Lastly the check in was via lock box. We will definitely stay here again and again!!!!!

It looked run down until you drive 5 minutes out where everything appeared to be. I was not bothered by anyone, the area just didn't feel safe at first glance. You had to really work with the door to lock and unlock it. I was only 15 minutes from the AFB to attend my son's graduation. All in all, the place was close to everything; shopping, dining, etc."

On a side note: there was a major water leak in the area (not at the house). When we alerted Jorge of this situation (late at night when we arrived back at rental) he went above and beyond to relocate us to another property if necessary. Fortunately, that wasn't required as the city workers repaired the water leak in the neighborhood overnight. It was very professional that Jorge responded quickly with a solution if needed."

Fair price also for the stay compared to some of the hotels in my opinion."

He was quick to respond to any question or comment I had and addressed any concerns I had immediately.

Easy check in, private entrance, assigned parking, and an extremely comfy bed! You can tell Lisa and Norm really care that you have a great stay at their place. I use air bnb a lot and this has to be one of my favorite places I’ve stayed! I was in town visiting my husband for his birthday who is currently training at the Sheppard Air Force Base, which is conveniently located less than a 15 min drive away. This is a safe place if you are solo traveling. It just so happened that 2 of my favorite places we ate at are less than a 5 min drive. If you’re looking for quick fast food check out Braum’s, and if you’re looking for somewhere a little fancier we went to Fox Hill Restaurant & Gardens for his birthday dinner. I’m very thankful for Lisa & Norm, they made my stay in Wichita Falls a memorable one! I highly recommend staring here (:"

They had all the things anyone would need in case they forgot toiletries and the place had plenty of bottled water, coffees, and a wide selection of teas.
The hosts were super helpful and accommodating throughout my stay. They even left some muffins and a sweet card when I arrived!

He works as a traveling ER doc in Vernon from time to time, and on this trip, he had the unenviable job of working 24-hour shifts on Christmas Eve and the day after Christmas. He spent Christmas Day resting up at the guest house. It is such a lovely and comfortable place, with beautiful gardens and decor, that it is surely the best option for him in Wichita Falls. A nice restaurant, Fox Hill Restaurant and Gardens, is 3 minutes away. He is delighted with this Airbnb and had a peaceful stay."

Stayed one night","This small studio was packed with caring touches by Lisa and Norm. From the moment I walked in and received a handwritten welcome note to the moment I left with an extra toothbrush cover because I'd forgotten mine (and of course this host would have them available along with many other extras) this space oozes with hospitality.
If you're looking for a small private getaway in Wichita Falls, this is your place."

Lisa Or Norm made sure that I was comfortable, had everything I needed, and that they were accessible throughout my stay. It is very small, as long as you are prepared to not have a spacious environment, you'll be happy. They also make their back patio available for dining or just relaxing. It's a VERY quiet neighborhood. I would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I could not say one bad thing about this place if I tried. I stayed here with my boyfriend because he is currently at Sheppard AFB, and it was a perfect little casita. It had everything you could need and Lisa and Norm even provide some things that you might have forgotten such as body wash, loofahs, deodorant and more! We stayed here over Thanksgiving and they went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable and they would always respond right away to any questions or anything we had over text. While we were staying here on Thanksgiving, Lisa and Norm provided a delicious meal for us because everything was closed and that meant a lot to us. I read a comment that said “you can tell that they host because they love it” and I couldn’t agree more. I will definitely be staying here if I am ever in Wichita Falls again if I could rate this place a 10/5 stars I totally would! Their hospitality is something that you can’t find often so I had a lovely experience."

It’s in a winding street neighborhood with lots of trees and a little pond too. Lisa greeted me very warmly and provided helpful info about where I could pick up dinner. The cottage behind the main house is a perfect retreat for one guest. I was amazed at how many thoughtful amenities were packed into the space, yet it felt spacious! No detail was left out! There was a place for luggage, a cute writing desk, FULL kitchen and everything needed to prepare a meal, if one should choose to cook. Lisa and Norm even prepared a delicious dessert snack and a thoughtful welcome note. The place was spotlessly clean.

Stayed a few nights",Amazing place! My gf and I really enjoyed the Casita. Would recommend to anyone looking for a smaller ARBNB place and not worry about having a huge space!

Stayed a few nights","I felt extremely safe and welcome at Michelle’s place. The Casita was so artistically decorated and peaceful—got some great sleep! It’s also very close to historic downtown Wichita Falls, which I love. I would definitely stay here again."
