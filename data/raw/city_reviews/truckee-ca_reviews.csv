Stayed a few nights","This is the first time I rented an air b&b - was a little nervous but the air b&b was perfect! So happy that it matched the picture! Very clean and comfortable! It was located in a very beautiful and safe area! Felt very safe staying there by my self!
The one thing I would recommend is that the heat be turned on before the guest arrive - I checked in at 1 am and the temp was at 50 degrees - it was very cold 🥶
Apart from that I would definitely rent this air b&b the next time I am in California!"

The one thing keeping this from being a 5 star review were the overhead lights made me feel like I was under fluorescent lighting. Wish the light bulbs were warmer instead of cold white.

The fireplace got the room toasty quickly and we enjoyed some board games as well. The shower was amazing - hot water immediately and the water pressure is perfect.
My partner and I both agree this is one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed in. We would definitely book this place again!"

Stayed a few nights","This AirBnb is a great option in Truckee. It's about 1 mile from the nearest restaurant/brewery (Fifty Fifty - with killer dark beers in particular) - so walkable-ish, but certainly close to town and Northstar if you're here to ski.
The unit was pristinely clean and comfortable and attractive. It is small, but more than enough for a couple. The bed was very comfortable, but the sheets are a terrycloth material that while very warm, may or may not be to everyone's liking.
Shower has good water pressure and get plenty hot enough quickly.
We cook several meals in during our vacations. The kitchen is equipped with what looked like bran- new Cuisinart nonstick cookware. Be aware however it is not stocked with certain basics you'll want if you're gonna cook much such as cooking oil, tin foil or ziplock bags, or more than a handful of coffee filters.
all in all, this is a fantastic option for a stay in the North Tahoe area - highly recommend"

Stayed one night",Great place and super close to the ski resorts. Only comment was the night we stayed the shower couldn’t get any hotter than luke warm. This was a bummer because there is nothing better than a nice hot shower after skiing all day. I mentioned this to the owner so hopefully they will get it fixed for the next guest. I still gave her a good rating since the place was still clean and check in was seamless. Would stay here again!

Stayed a few nights",Stayed here for a wedding! Really pleasant apartment in beautiful surroundings! Within easy driving/biking distance or semi-ambitious walking distance to all that downtown Truckee has to offer. The front porch is such a nice feature for getting a bit of fresh air. Blinds on all the windows were perfect for that necessary nap between the ceremony and reception! Also appreciate separate thermostats for living room versus bedroom. Water heater was good quality: can withstand a back-to-back shower and bath.

Amazing location, beautiful outdoor deck where we enjoyed our morning coffee. Just so peaceful and exactly what I needed for a two day escape! The house is located on the second floor, with privacy. The house was beautiful and spotless and very spacious for a one bedroom. BJ was responsive yet let us have our privacy for our time there. I’m a seasoned Airbnb host myself and I actually took some pointers after staying in this beautiful home! Thank you BJ, I will be back soon!"

Stayed with kids","We made a very quick decision to stay here for one night when 80 closed during the snowstorms. Her place is close to Truckee and the freeway and it felt better than driving back to Tahoe City where we still had our original place for a day. We were very grateful to find this spot. BJ was communicative and they plowed the driveway for our arrival. That said, they did not let us use their somewhat covered driveway and insisted we park where our car got covered with snow overnight and took a long time to clean in the morning. We had a baby with us and were stuck in a storm of the century and they showed no grace in a more extended checkout time (no one was getting anywhere) either. Also their bedroom was frigid. She claimed it never happens. They have three fans but no space heater. Her suggestion was turn up the fireplace and direct fans at the room. we had to put blankets on our infant and stay up all night making sure she didn’t suffocate. There is also no dishwasher."

Convenient to Northstar, grocery stores, downtown Truckee, and nearby restaurants like Drunken Monkey and Fifty Fifty.
Wifi and streaming TV worked very well.
Be aware that it is upstairs and you will need to walk up the stairs."

Stayed a few nights",This home was very comfortable for our visit. I don't remember seeing on the listing that there is a very step set of stairs to access the home. This wasn't a problem for us but it could be for some folks. The home is conveniently located about a 5 min drive from a very nice hiking trail. There is a Safeway close to the house and the kitchen is well equipped so you can make your own meals. We were allowed a late check out which was really helpful.

Stayed a few nights","Great location for Truckee. It's only about 2 miles to the main part of town, where all the shops and restaurants are. And there's a Tesla Super Charging station right down the road, which is super convenient. It's also only about 15 minutes from the Ritz-Carlton, if you happen to be in town for a wedding there, which I was. The apartment is clean and comfortable. The deck is nice, but there is a surprising number of cars driving by, so it's not the quietest place to relax. Would definitely stay here again if I have to come back to Truckee/North Lake Tahoe."

Stayed a few nights","This place had everything that other reviews described. Is perfect for beginner skiing at Tahoe Donner. My visit was 2 nights on the 3rd floor. Title says condos, but it’s more like a studio apartment/hotel building with multiple units.
Here are a list of my pros and cons:
Pro’s
Nice view of lift
Competitive pricing
Quiet/warm/comfy (we stayed tues/weds)
Exit stairway made shorter access to lifts.
Kitchen: Hotplate, pan utensils, dish soap, replacement trash bags.
No weird smells, very clean!
Bathroom towels and bed sheets smelled very clean; huge square shower-head; hot/icy showers!
Comfy memory foam queen bed, feather down pillows but there are regular pillows in closet
Blackout drapes
Ice machine
Cons
No one at reception desk (although host Eric was very responsive)
GPS leaves you on the road, had trouble finding the lodge.
Grocery store is about 11 mins away
Toilet flushing weak, at one point had to plunge and refrain from flushing TP
Previous guests left food in freezer"

Stayed with kids","Eric was great with his communication. The place was clean and for those who love skiing/snowboarding, the location is perfect! It's right by the base of the Tahoe Donner ski resort.
The room is great for 2 or max 3 people. We had a 2 night stay, and 3 of us - so it was quick but at the same time - comfortable. There's a fridge, microwave and a coffee -maker (make sure you carry your own coffee and filters) and a sink. Although there are lots of pots and pans - you can't cook anything as there is no cooking range or a hot plate for cooking.
The bathroom was clean, had good products. The bathtub is slightly tall to get in for short people (like me :) Plenty of towels, blankets and bedsheets and pillows.
We went here in winter - so there is a space heater and wall heater - not too sure if there is an air conditioner as well.
Overall a great find for a quick short stay!"

Eric was also very responsive, and we appreciated his proactive communication when we had a question. Overall, we felt very comfy and at home for our night away, and would definitely stay there again in the future."

Eric's flat has recently been remodeled and is very clean. I had not properly noted down the wifi password and Eric was immediately available to help us out with the correct one. Great place, great host and we had a wonderful week-end."

Eric was awesome. We had actually booked with him the week before and he proactively reached out and had us check the weather and worked with us. All his directions and tips were super easy to follow. What a great spot!"

The place was very clean, and well designed, with a nice open living room and kitchen, great for hanging out with friends and family. The house was not too far from downtown Truckee, walkable for sure in the summer, but probably best to drive during the winter. The master bathroom had a wonderful soaking tub, perfect for after skiing. Easy to get to Northstar, which is where we skied this visit. Would come again!"

The only downside for winter is that the location is a little further from downtown Truckee than we thought - probably quite walkable in spring or summer, but in the cold and dark of winter, walking home up the hill would not be fun.
I would definitely return and recommend Aaron and his property."

The place is everything we look for, clean, modern, great location, garage (able to charge our car), and friendly and responsive host :) We've stayed once in the summer (6 of us) and now a winter trip and it is a fantastic location for anytime of the year. There are great restaurants in downtown Truckee (walking distance when weather permits) and also a very short drive to Northstar and other resorts. It is spacious enough for our family of 4 or 6 (when grandparents joined). I also like the layout of the kids room with the bunk beds being downstairs and the kitchen and master bedroom upstairs. We look forward to staying again soon!!!"

The PowHaus was one of the best decisions for our trip as it provided more than what we needed for our enjoyment with small children. After a full day of ski lessons, we were more than happy to come back to the Airbnb for home cooked meals. Everything was convenient and we couldn’t have asked for a more comfortable stay. We’ll be in touch for our next trip! Thanks Aaron!

There was plenty of space for my family to hangout together and also retreat to our own rooms for privacy. The house was close to North Lake Tahoe and allowed us to enjoy a weekend getaway on the lake. Aaron was also great with communication and responded to questions in a timely manner.

The Kitchen, bathrooms, laundry room are all stocked with everything you will need. We drive and EV and there is a nema 14-50 outlet that ensure we have a full charge for everyday adventures."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at the Palisades PowHaus was AMAZING to say the least. Aaron's home is thoughtfully designed and carefully curated for all travelers. First off all the home is almost brand new, in the guest book we only saw a few entries before us. Secondly, the place was SPARKLING clean - My friend and I are complete OCD Clean freaks and we didn't even feel the need to double clean when we arrived! We were 2 families traveling together with 3 kids (under 5) and we had a ton of fun and wished we had booked more nights. The home is equipped with all the latest technology and Aaron sends a full e-handbook about the home and location before your trip so you know what to expect. My fave is there is a thermostat for both the first and second floors so you can control the temp wherever you are. We spent time playing in the side-yard area where there was plenty of snow for the kids to enjoy. Many other resorts are and sledding areas are close by within 30minutes of driving as well. We happened to meet a few neighbors in the small townhome community and everyone was wonderful and kind to us as well. There are a few board games in the closet, the TV is equipped with all major video apps + surround sound for movie nights, and kitchen had everything we needed to cook multiple delicious meals and the dining table sat all of us and more. The master bath is to DIE for - the design in the home is so beautiful and modern. Shampoo, Conditioner, body wash, and lotion were all provided in small personal bottles like a hotel. Aaron was also super responsive and helpful throughout our stay and we had absolutely no issues at all. We will DEFINITELY be returning for another trip in the near future. Thank you so much Aaron!"

Aaron’s communications were prompt and accurate. We will book Aaron’s place again."

Stayed a few nights","What a perfect Truckee / Tahoe experience!! We had the best time in this incredible home and unbelievable location. Aaron’s house is so tastefully done - feels/looks fresh in every corner & incredibly clean. We didn’t want to leave.
We picked it for its quick access to all the ski resorts (which was amazing), but realized another star of the show is Truckee itself, and loved how we could walk down to town - please check out Moody’s for drinks / dinner!
Aaron’s townhouse is in a very beautiful (seemingly brand new) small collection of homes and the drive was plowed & the surroundings are beautiful - remote feeling yet close to town.
We are particularly picky on beds, and the POW HAUS didn’t disappoint - we slept great! Also loved the very well appointed kitchen & wonderfully helpful guidebook + the smart tech making check in & out a breeze.
This house is as comfortable/cozy as it is instgram-amable/stylish - highly recommend it for a group of friends or a family. Don’t’ miss the awesome deck & BBQ!"

Stayed a few nights","Aarons home was so thoughtfully decorated to have a mountain modern but still cozy cabin feel! It’s spacious not only in the rooms but has a beautiful family table to play games and eat around which is ideal for any family trip.
The location is easy to get to resorts in North Lake and it’s walkable! There is a paved path that takes you right from the condo to the truckee river path and to a path to get downtown. There was snow but it was plowed which was a huge bonus. I cannot wait to come back during summer to rude our bikes!
Communication was great, kitchen has everything needed and the beds were comfortable. I travel a lot and would highly recommend this place.
Oh and I can’t forget my favorite part of the entire place... there was a really cool neon sign in the garage that says “POW HAUS” above the ski rack. Perfect Instagram for my ski trip if I’m being honest!"

Stayed a few nights","We had such a great time at Palisades PowHaus. The location is ideal for both frequent Tahoe travelers and visitors from afar since it's really easy to get to off the highway and its close proximity to all that Tahoe has to offer: top notch ski resorts, downtown Truckee, hiking trails, parks, golf courses, and more. The check-in process was seamless and Aaron is very responsive and communicative, though we didn't really have to contact him as everything worked great!
The house itself is even better than the photos! Plenty of room for a large group or family but still feels cozy enough that it give you an authentic Tahoe cabin feel. It felt much more like a home than your typical Airbnb listing with comfortable furnishing and all the modern amenities you would want. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you need since we cooked all our meals during our stay there. The garage can fit two cars and has an outlet for EV charging and space to store your gear. All the bedrooms have large windows and a lot of privacy with views into the woods. There's also a generous amount of outdoor space with room to grill and hang out.
If you're looking at this listing and thinking about booking, rest assured you'll make the right decision! It was one of the best weekends I've had in a while!"

The Bike house is perfectly located for a little get-a-way, My wife was 32 weeks pregnant and was able to walk to downtown where all the shops, and restaurants are. The place is very well maintained and clean. it would be 5 stars if not for the sleeping situation. Its a pull out couch that is not comfortable. There is a loft with 2 twin mattress that are adequate however as mentioned my pregnant wife didn't like going down the ladder at 3am to pee. Once again Great Place just needs a better mattress for the pullout"

Stayed with kids","The place was pretty nice. It had beautiful views and was what we expected. The kitchen was well stocked with nice little extras.
Unfortunately, for us, there were some cleanliness issues in the bathroom. The worst was the moldy shower curtain, top of the tub and hairs on the shower walls. I have a mold sensitivity, and thankfully I didn't become ill. The floors were also cold accept near the bathroom. Guessing all the cracks in the floor is a sign the floor heating needs repair? The place was warm overall though.
The check out instructions were contradictory between the book vs wall sign. The book was more lax, but the wall sign gave instructions to basically clean the place. We were expected to remove bedding and towels and put them in a pile, take out trash/recycling and open all windows. Worst of all was the expectation for us to wash our dishes by hand and put them away. These expectations would have been acceptable had it not been for the $150 cleaning fee."

What made our stay truly special was our host Christine. We faced a bit of a hiccup when we lost our key on the first day, which made us quite worried.

Stayed a few nights","This was probably my favorite airbnb experience of all time. The place felt extremely cozy and inviting. We stayed for thanksgiving and were able to make really nice meals using the bbq outside. The view of the river was amazing. The place was absolutley charming and pristine. We had peace and quiet and well-deserved rest after hiking around Tahoe. We particularly appreciated the heating system coming through the floor, thus making the place warm but not blown dry. The instructions were very clear and to the point. We had some interesting books about the town and Tahoe trails that we fully enjoyed reading. It was trully wonderful and I fully recommend this to everyone."

Stayed a few nights","Delightful, cozy and comfortable. I loved the patio overlooking the Truckee River and even slept with the sliding door partially open so I could hear the river at night. The unit is very well designed and has everything you need for preparing simple meals. Plus there are lots of restaurants in Truckee. Some guests have complained about the sofa bed, and while I did not find it very comfortable for side sleeping, it was fine if I was sleeping on my back or stomach. I slept soundly and did not wake up with hip or back pain as I sometimes do at home, so I give it a thumbs up! You do hear the trains, but I did not find them intrusive.
Christine and Paul were so friendly and helpful. I thank them for a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights",Wow! What an amazing space! This little studio on the river was by far one of my favorite Airbnbs. It was incredibly clean and provided everything I needed for a getaway to decompress. I didn't even mind the intermittent construction noise down the street as the river bed provided beautiful background noise. My favorite was being able to relax in bed and still have the views of the trees and water. It felt very private despite being attached to he hosts home. The space is beautifully thought out and even the tiny kitchen had more amenities than some of the bigger Airbnbs I have stayed in . Christine was a very thoughtful host and easy to communicate with. I definitely plan on coming back whenever I need to getaway for a relaxing vacation.

Stayed a few nights","Stop scrolling and just book. I searched for weeks trying to find a place for hubby and I to stay that was a great value, on the water, charming and clean and close to Lake Tahoe, not to mention walkable to downtown Truckee. The place is well situated on the picturesque Truckee River. We stayed in mid September so it was a nice surprise to find the heated floors on as the mornings can be a little chilly. The sofa bed was too firm for us (which I knew based on the reviews) so we decided to put the two twin size beds found in the loft together and make one large comfy bed. The entire neighborhood is very peaceful never say the owner but one friendly neighbor and his adorable dogs. My only drawback was the trains at night, the 1st night (Thursday) I heard it 5 times, seconds night 3 times and by the night 3rd time I didn’t hear it at all, I guess you just get used to the noise. Even with that being said I would definitely stay here again and highly recommended."

The view from the back porch is amazing and the sound of the river very peaceful. The apartment was neat and tidy and it’s clear that cleanliness was prioritized.

My partner said it was like living in a screensaver image with one of those beautiful pictures of nature.
The place was really modern and was fine for two people. We were really impressed by the kitchen appliances. There is a high quality induction stove and toaster oven that I don't remember mentioned in the description. It allowed us to cook food when we wanted.
This is the kind of place you can leave the car parked during your entire stay and walk everywhere, including a nice park across the river. We also saw lots of wildlife like beaver, coyote, and lots of birds.
I hope to make this a longer term stay on our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Christine's place on the river was one of my favorite places I have stayed in recent memory. Sitting on the porch and listening to the river while tons of wildlife (birds, chipmunks) dart around was relaxing and fun to watch. The place was also a very close walk to downtown Truckee and just across the river from some walking trails through a park. Of course just note the ladder to the loft can be tricky for some- and use the mat for the bathtub floor--it was slippery! Note that you are attached to the owner's home and porch is by their bedroom window, but I never heard anything and barely ran into anyone while I stayed. I would stay here again without hesitation if I was in the area!"

The place is accessorized with carefully chosen selections of bedding, kitchenware, and art in just the right places. Fantastic bathroom with everything you need. Walked to “town” and enjoyed early Christmas shopping in delightful, uncrowded shops with super friendly staff, full of unique gifts. Watched the candy shop “Sweets” make cashew brittle. Met knowledgeable lady at the Chamber office who provided maps and info about the area. Met hosts Chris and Paul and enjoyed our brief chat about their busy lives and love of the area.

DO NOT plan on sleeping on the pull out sofa unless you bring a mattress topper yourself. The ""sofa bed"" is just 2 inches of foam on top of a board. Kind of like sleeping on a thin pad on the ground when camping.
The twin beds in the loft were comfortable, according to my kids."

The pull-out bed ended up being too firm for our liking but we slept great on the mattresses in the loft area! Thanks for a great stay Christine, we hope to come again soon."

Stayed a few nights","This is a sweet spot for a couple or small group. It had everything we needed including enough of a kitchen to do breakfasts and make lunches in the unit. The location is great for walking up into truckee (10-15min walk) for dinner or drinks and a short drive to the Tahoe area.
One word of advice to light sleepers, the house is right on the train tracks so that may be a bother to some. It surprised us the first night (should have observed our surroundings better lol) but luckily we sleep like rocks so it wasn’t an issue. Helped to keep all track-side windows closed.
Otherwise, we loved the porch looking over the river, the loft twin beds were fun and comfy, and we appreciated the well-stocked kitchenette."

We loved picking up coffee in the morning, bringing it back to the house and sitting down by the river in peace before our busy day began. It's also only a 25 minute drive from the North Side of Lake Tahoe. An easy ride and the perfect distance away from the hustle and bustle you can find near the lake with all the tourists.
I highly recommend this home to anyone who is looking for a relaxing place to recharge during the exploration of the Lake Tahoe area."

The location is perfect - right on the river and within easy walking distance of both downtown Truckee and the Truckee Millennium trail. There is a patio where you can sit and watch the river flow, as well as comfortable chairs right at the river's edge. Incredibly beautiful and relaxing! The space itself is small, but super well thought out and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is tiny but has everything you might need for two people. We didn't try to climb to the loft, but we found the sofa bed to be very comfortable, although quite firm. We barely saw the hosts, who live in the main house, but they were kind and helpful when we needed them. Overall a wonderful stay, and we hope to be back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I couldn't imagine a lovelier setting. The room looks out over the Truckee River, and it's so close that one is lulled to sleep by the sound of the river. Our hosts had set up chairs on the patio outside the room, and there were chairs on the banks of the river for our use as well. As others have mentioned, the sofa bed is very uncomfortable, so I climbed up to the loft and slept on one of the plush twin mattresses. I wish we had brought our mattress topper. That would have been a big help. The room is full of windows and bright in the morning sun. I would suggest bringing an eye mask if you wake up with the sun because the shades do not make the room dark.
Our hosts had the kitchen and bathroom stocked with anything we might need, and Christine was available if we needed anything. It truly was a pleasure staying there!"

Stayed one night","So many wonderful aspects about this place! Location and walkability to downtown, the river, very clean and tidy, tastefully done build right in keeping with the style of Truckee and a nice focus on recycled/repurposed woodwork! The hydronic floors are lovely heat!
The bed is as difficult or possibly worse than I had imagined! I could not sleep without getting sore every so often! If you are a flat back or stomach sleeper and spread the weight of your body out you may be ok. I like to sleep on my sides too and that was like sleeping on a concrete slab with a few layers of cardboard and a blanket! No give, no cushion, and for us, little good shuteye!
If you, as we did, prioritize other aspects of a worthwhile stay ( location, style, price etc) maybe consider bringing a mattress topper to make the bed more comfy? Seems crazy to pay so much and not get at least a somewhat comfortable bed!
The upstairs twin beds are comfy but tight on headroom, and you need to climb a ladder to ascend or descend. And they are twins!
Also, no stovetop in the house! Microwave and BBQ outside only! These two things alone (bed and no cooking) make this choice a tough one to consider again!
A simple mattress topper would make it a strong contender though!
My take is that they are doing everything to discourage couples from enjoying any cuddle time! And yup, it worked!
This was also my first ever Airbnb where the price breakdown ended up costing more for the cleaning portion of the rental than the actual rental!! So many great things about it but, unfortunately, some critically unappealing features as well!
Don’t skim past the bed reviews!"

The finishings were high end and it left it feeling very comfortable and worth every penny of what they’re charging. The back patio is such an amazing place to hang out and watch the river flow. The only con, which only applies to certain people is that it’s attached to the main house and the owners bedroom is directly on the other side of the wall so don’t make ANY noise after 9, which is very early for some people."

It’s such a special spot with the creek on one side and the train tracks on the other. We enjoyed watching the trains go by, but we’re never woken up by them during the night. The space is very bright, clean, and peaceful with an unbeatable proximity to town. With parking in Truckee being difficult it was so nice to be able to walk to dinner or to our favorite coffee shop, Dark Horse. This is a perfect place if you want to be close to town but feel like you’re in a unique home with an amazing view."

The stairs to the loft looked daunting but were not bad as there are lots of places to hold onto at the top. The house is a three minute walk to downtown Truckee and a lovely paved trail is even closer. We had a great time!

Stayed a few nights",My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Christine’s place very much. We visited for 5 days and absolutely loved the location of the home. It’s very small (think studio apartment size) but it’s perfect for only two people. There is a kitchenette (not a full kitchen) but we opted to eat out for every meal (Tahoe has some of the best food!!!). The apartment is walking distance to downtown Truckee and sits right on the river. The weather was perfect so we enjoyed sitting outside on the patio listening to the river in the afternoons. The pull out sofa bed is not super comfortable so I much preferred the twin mattress in the loft however just FYI if you are one who has to wake up in the night to use the restroom you are not going to want to climb down the ladder when you’re half asleep (it’s pretty steep). The owners of the home are very sweet and made us feel very welcome. Overall we loved our stay and highly recommend to other couples looking for a relaxing stay at a home away from home.

For starters, the hot tub needs to be warmed up prior to your arrival as they take a long time to heat up in Truckee. That was not done yet the advertisement ensures you know about the tub.
Second, the refrigerator did not work so we had to improvise for all of our food & drinks. It overall did not feel worth the price, but it was still a nice stay with some hiccups as to be expected."

The house is very comfortable & has a spacious living area for all to gather in. Also a lovely deck & table to enjoy dinners outside. The bedrooms are nice with comfortable mattresses & linens. It’s worth noting that the house is located very close to the highway & that there is significant background noise from the highway during the summer when most windows are open. Hiking trails are readily accessible from the house & Donner Lake is just a short car ride away. Overall, Olga & her house, despite the noise, made for a terrific annual family vacation."

Stayed with a pet","This is the first time I’ve ever given less than 5 stars. Why? Bugs in house, filthy hot tub, no WiFi and no reasonable response.
When we arrived, two doors were wide open — not even the screens were closed. This led to all of us being bitten by mosquitoes while inside the house for the rest of the stay. 2 people in our party had giant moths fly onto their faces while trying to fall asleep, and there were a number of large ants wandering near the doors that had been left open.
WiFi only worked for an hour out of our entire stay. Host did not offer assistance in fixing it. Right before we left we fixed it for her. (More complicated than simple reboot, used our time/energy.)
Hot tub was unusable, slimy and sludgy. Host didn’t let us know maintenance would be performed while we were there, surprising us and the hot tub maintenance worker. We couldn’t use the bathroom for hours because it was used to fill the hot tub. Felt bad for the worker; it took him a long time to scrub the tub out."

Some additional instructions (garbage day, recycling, hot tub) would have been nice, but since COVID we don't see paper instructions in rentals much anymore.
Very nice neighborhood.
House is large and can accommodate a big group."

Stayed with a pet","Olga’s place was perfect for our group, with a spacious living area and enough individual rooms with a mix of queen beds and bunk beds for a combination of couples and friends. Although not shown in the pictures, there is a second bunk bed in the en-suite bedroom so it could easily sleep 10 if needed. The separate bunk bed room bed was long enough for our 6’ friend to comfortably fit in it too (not kid size).
The location was convenient to Palisades, downtown Truckee, and Donner State Park. We loved that it was pet and kid friendly too. As others have mentioned, it’s on a very steep hillside though, so no access to outdoor space for the dog, which wasn’t a problem for us since we took her hiking most of the day, but good to be aware of."

The location was also perfect for us, as it was just a short drive away from some of the best ski resorts in the area. The cabin was also close to downtown Truckee, where we enjoyed exploring the local shops and restaurants.
One of our favorite things about the cabin was that we could bring our pups, which made our stay that much better. There was also a hot tub which was a perfect place to relax after a long day on the slopes. The views from the cabin were also good.
The host was also incredibly friendly and accommodating, providing us with all the information we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible."

We were there during an history-making snow storm and Olga was super communicative and flexible with us needing to stay an extra night (we got snowed in).
The only minor feedback I have is that the master bedroom downstairs was really cold (we had to buy a little space heater to keep our kids - who were sharing the room - from getting too cold). The rest of the house was nice and toasty warm.
We really had a wonderful time regardless and would highly recommend this rental."

The location is perfect close to groceries, the highway, and the ski mountain. The hot tub was right off the kitchen through the sliding door for easy access with great outdoor string lighting for a great nighttime vibe. The kitchen was well stocked and made for easy dinning. The beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were stocked with great products. There were many towels to use.
The host was kind enough to extend our check out so that we could stay late Sunday to watch the Super Bowl- just so so nice of them! Their communication was great and friendly. This house is a great value for the price.
I thought the highway would be noisier and an issue for sleeping so close to the house but it was fine. Very peaceful neighborhood.
Highly recommend, would love to stay again!"

This caused us great stress before our stay, but Olga resolved the issue efficiently and fairly, which we appreciated. Olga went above and beyond to sort everything out. The impact on our plans ended up minimal and the resolution fulfilled our needs in the end, so we’re thankful to have had her as a host."

Upstairs is spacious and the kitchen is well stocked, and the bedrooms downstairs are comfortable. The kids enjoyed the selection of games, especially the awesome chess set.

The home was just as pictured, extremely clean, and perfectly located just minutes from both downtown Truckee and Donner Lake. Inside you'll find all the comforts of home. Our family appreciated the large table perfect for a family dinner or game night, as well as the spacious bedrooms with very comfortable beds. We found the cabin peaceful and relaxing and enjoyed the beautiful views from every window. We just wished we cold have stayed longer!"

Olga responded immediately with any questions or concerns and dropped off a few cables for the TV so we could watch movies. There is no satellite or cable service, but the internet works well for streaming. We had kids with us and thought there would be yard space out back for snowplay and dogs to meander, but it's on a huge hill so that wasn't possible. The whole place looked and smelled sparkling clean when we arrived and the beds are pretty comfy. Overall, a pleasant experience and quality time spent with family. :)"

Stayed with kids","This was a comfy stay. There is no cable TV which we take as a good thing. If you need, bring an HDMI cable to connect to your laptop or iPad.
Internet worked well. The only problem we had was when the power went out for a couple hours the morning we were checking out. Thankfully we were able to manually pull the garage door open to get the truck out.
There was still coffee grinds in the coffee maker and not fully cleaned dishes in the cabinets, so just be sure to give your dishes a good wash before you use them.
Most of the outlets in the master bedroom don’t work, I think one does and the light switch doesn’t work.
The overall layout upstairs was nice and open. We had a 17 mos old and 2.5 year old running all over the place.
Coffee and spices are provided with cooking oil. The cookware is great.
Location is stellar and the drive in and drive way isn’t steep so no worries when there is snow.
Loved the chess set. Random I know but it brought back some childhood memories of play.
Check in was a bit on the late side at 4pm. Checkout was 11am which was better than most early checkouts, definitely appreciated that."

Group trip",Our group was looking for a spacious and pet-friendly house that was conveniently located to be able to ski at Northstar. We couldn't have asked for a better set-up for what we needed. The location is so convenient and right next to the highway entrance (seems minor but some parts of Tahoe can be soul crushing getting in/out in the snow - this avoids that hassle). The house was clean and welcoming. Olga was quick to respond to any questions and was a great host for us. Would definitely recommend this house to others.

Yasmin was also very easy to communicate with and respond quickly with photos on any questions about driveway, checkin that I had. We were a family of 4 and the sleeping situation was absolutely perfect with comfortable beds. The kitchen has pretty much everything you need to make a meal. Yes the heater makes a loud sound in the middle of the night but since it’s an older home it’s understandable, we weren’t really bothered by it. I would absolutely stay at Yasmin’s place again and am looking forward to coming back this season or next."

Stayed with kids","Really great stay! We especially appreciated the board games available to guests. Very cozy cabin! My family of four had a great time. I read this on other reviews and want to emphasize: there is a very steep staircase with shallow stairs up to the loft area. If you are bringing an older person or someone who isn’t stable on their feet, make sure they stay in the full bed bottom bunk (there are just two bedrooms) and that you have people in your party who are nimble on their feet and can climb the stairs to sleep in the other bed, I would absolutely stay here again with my husband and 2 kids."

There are a few things to be aware of. The entry point to the two bottom bunk beds is limited but good for small children. The stairs to the loft are narrow and steep. You need to be sure footed and spry. We took our two dogs and there were baskets with some dog essentials too.
Overall an affordable and great place to stay!"

The neighbors were quiet and parking was available right at the stairs leading down to the house. The downstairs was comfortable and it had good amenities in the kitchen. Robert was friendly very easy to reach.
The freeway noise from outside the home or on the deck was louder than we expected. Getting down from the loft area is a bit treacherous at night. The bathroom is downstairs. The stair case is very step and the steps are shallow. I'm a sure footed person but it's not fun having to take the steps down. The only proper adult bed is in the loft. Three bunks that fit small children are downstairs."

The only negative (very small inconvenience) was that the stairs to the loft were very narrow and steep so you just need to be careful going up and down. Price is great for the space and we had no issues. Robert even had the house ready prior to 3 so we were able to check in early! Great house for kids. We would definitely stay here again.

The stairs to the loft are a bit sketchy and very loud (I wouldn't have an elderly person climb them and a solid railing would be helpful). No paper towels/napkins in kitchen (I couldn't find them). I'd totally stay again!

Stayed with a pet","We had a good weekend at Robert’s cabin. It was a bit tricky balancing the temperature in the loft and downstairs, but after the first night we figured it out. Our kids liked the bunks and the games that were in their room. The cabin is cozy, yet plenty big enough for our family of 4 and our dog. I imagine the deck functions as another room in the summer, and it’s pretty big! The location of the cabin is great - close to Truckee, but quiet and it felt more neighborhood-like. We really appreciated the shoveled parking spot and steps to the cabin upon arrival. Thanks"

Stayed with kids","We loved staying here. It was the perfect cozy place to take a mental break from the crazy busy city life. Robert was very quick answering all emails/messages. Instructions getting there were pretty clear. We did have trouble trying to find the key lock, but I missed checking messages with updated instructions. The minute we entered it smelled a bit like Clorox, definitely was clean. The boys got very comfortable on the couch where we had movie nights. Kitchen had mostly what it needs. Pots were great but pans need to be replace. Stove is functional yet the oven needed a huge cleaning so we couldn’t bake anything/frozen pizza or bread. The bunk room was perfect for the kids. Loft stairs are a bit steep, but the loft looked perfect. It was a bit dusty and some dog hair but honestly I didn’t mind. It does get toasty. The thermostat was a bit comfusing even with instructions but after we figured it out and opened the windows it was fine. Boys enjoyed playing outside in the snow."

Robert was open to adjusting the cost of our stay and flexible check-in. he also shoveled the walkway and parking spot for us before checkin. but be prepared to shovel yourself if you're expecting snowfall during your stay. place is dog friendly which we love! but have to take a flight of stairs to get to the cabin. the stairs to the sleeping space upstairs is also very steep ( fine for sober adults, but proceed with caution for children or not sober adults)."

Cabin was cozy and in a quiet neighbourhood near the lake. Well setup place and Robert left great notes. Top room does, get a bit toasty when the heater is running, takes a little practice to dial it in and the bottom bunk of the three tier bunk is definitely low overhead, probably okay for a kid.
Overall great place, would recommend for a weekend getaway in the area or if in town for skiing."

Stayed with a pet","Cute cozy little place! Super large couch comfortable for a family of 4, plenty of entertainment options. Kitchen is small but perfectly functional, and spices and teas were appreciated. Located 1 block away from a little market and a WONDERFUL diner (breakfast/lunch). We were lucky enough to catch early-season snow, and there is a fun little sledding hill directly across the road. The place was newly remodeled and clean and functional. Only difficulty was the thermostat is old and the arrow that indicates temperature set had broken off, so you couldn't tell what temp it was set to, and the on/off switch was also kind of broken. It gets very hot up in the loft if the heat is too high, so that was a bit tricky to deal with. Robert's communication was great and he obviously cares about the home and guests a lot, so I imagine that little glitch will be remedied soon. Overall delightful and cozy cabin."

Things I didn’t enjoy so much…
Mattress is memory foam, you might like them, my back hates them.
House locks but all the knobs are loose so not super secure if you have valuables, but it’s a great neighborhood, so grains of salt etc.
The stairs from the road and the deck used to access the house or crazy old and have a lot of dry rot, so step carefully.
Lighting inside is super dim."

We will definitely look into staying here in the future."

It is also right down the road from Donner Lake, which would be very convenient in the warmer months. The cabin was cozy and had everything we needed during our stay. It snowed a couple of feet the first night and there were 2 shovels available to help get the car out. Robert was very communicative about check in and check out. Would definitely stay again."

I recommend turning the heater off or down a few hours before you get to sleep so that your not burning up upstairs. There are also stairs to get to the house and very steep stairs inside. If you have issues with getting up and down stairs i walking I do not recommend staying here. 4 of us stayed for 4 days and cooked all our meals. WiFi was good. Everything was super clean. I would come again.

Stayed with kids","Overall a great stay!!! Robert was easy to communicate with. The cabin is very spot on to the description & pictures. The stairs upstairs to the loft are indeed steep with no actual handrail. It gets very HOT upstairs during the Winter with the furnace going. The furnace grate in located on the floor between the kitchen/ hallway. This was scary with a little running around. But we walked away unharmed. There is everything you need for cooking, you'll just need to bring your own storage containers if you want to take your leftovers home. The upgrades made around the cabin are very nice! You do have to park on the road and walk down a stairway to get to the cabin, so be mindful about how much you pack Overall this was a great cabin for our little weekend get away!"

Quiet neighborhood (a tiny bit of highway noise but nothing to detour ya). There are a few stairs down to the cabin so get there before sunset if you can. There’s also a convenient store close by down towards the lake for any last minute needs or drinks for the hikes (check out the state park!) A+"

Stayed with kids","Unfortunately we couldn’t really enjoy our stay too much, the loft where the queen bed is up the stairs, the stairs are very squeaky and narrow, that is in the description though. There is a window from the view of the loft that the neighbors lights shined in all night long, not allowing us to sleep whatsoever. And I don’t just mean a little dull light, the entire 3rd story of that house was fully lit and it was literally like we had lights on in the loft (which we didn’t)
I think the cleaning fee is a little high as there were cobwebs all in the loft and on the wood which you can see from the stairs.
The owner was nice and did offer us a discount if we would ever consider using one of his other units in future, I wish it would have been a partial refund since we only stayed one night, although booked for two. But no way we would have been able to attempt to sleep there again if the neighbors light was on all night again.
We also weren’t able to get the heater working so we were pretty cold all night long.
The owner did have great communication and was prompt with responding."

We loved sitting on the patio looking at all the beautiful trees and enjoying a little time away.
We had fun driving to the beach which was very close by, while the water was cold for us (we did get knee deep in the water) it was fun watching the children having a blast and paddle boarders having equally as much fun.
We loved walking through the neighborhood. One morning we walked to the Donner Lake Kitchen for breakfast, we can not recommend them highly enough, YUM!
Thank you Robert, you are a wonderful host, gave us all the information we needed and more about check-in and out and the sites to see, as well as the information about the cabin. We will definitely visit again. Warmly, Julie and Stephen"

Robert was a great host and made himself very available for questions, etc. He was generous with our time at the cabin The price was really good although the cleaning fee felt a little steep but we knew that going in. Comfortable living room area, nice TV (Roku availability) and a good strong Wifi signal. We slept well in the bunk beds downstairs as the stairs leading to the master bedroom were a little treacherous….they were narrow and could have used a handrail for gripping more comfortably. Bathroom was really clean and has been renovated nicely. Great place if you have a dog with room to roam and close to the lake. Again, really appreciated Robert’s attentiveness…felt lucky to find this by Donner Lake."

Kitchen is stocked with all the cooking necessities. There are plenty of boardgames to play! Along with free Netflix.

Stayed a few nights","This cabin is a great getaway for you and your family. All amenities are provided, which made it even better! One thing to keep in mind are the stairs inside the cabin. They are a bit too steep, so if you plan on bringing a dog, there is a probability that they will not be able to climb up to the second floor. Possibly might have to carry your dog upstairs. In addition, There are no curtains in the living room and there is only one heater in the entire house, which is compatible. 24 hour store is just 6 minutes away from the cabin and there is a very nice hike over at Donner Memorial State Park. Overall, this cabin was very clean and the environment was super quiet! Robert was an amazing host! For sure, looking forward to coming back!"

Stayed a few nights","Robert was a very responsive, friendly and accommodating host.
The house itself offers good value: It’s a cute little house on a pretty spacious property that was more than enough for my wife and I and our small dog. Would def still be comfortable with a blowup bed for a second couple downstairs (we saw it said a floor mattress in the common area but didn’t see one). Theres a really nice deck around the house that I sat on and read in the mornings and relaxed in the evenings—and despite being next to the freeway it was pretty peaceful and quiet. And plus, you’re a 15-25 minute walk to a ton of great trails around Donner if you really want to get away away. The beach at Donner Lake is a 2 minute drive away. There’s a nice big backyard down below with a great picnic table we ate breakfasts at (a neighbors dogs even came over to say hi!).
Amenities inside were updated. Nice kitchen with enough cooking tools and essentials. Updated bathroom. Comfortable living room and a nice sized TV.
Compared to a lot of other options i looked at in the area, I liked that there’s a nice two car parking space up front that can fit a car and a boat. We’d def consider coming back here with our boat.
As an aside, stairs were steeper and narrower than they looked, just a consideration for people with knee issues. Our small dog could not go up and down those stairs. But not a problem, we just carried her!
Overall a really good value and would recommend to others."

Stayed a few nights","In stark contrast to many previous travelers reviews, we found this place rather unwelcoming. The proximity to I-80 is remarkable with constant background noise and some view of passing trucks above while cooking.
There is no privacy (no blinds and shutters) in the main living area and the furniture could use an upgrade. Lights are dim making it difficult to read a book after sunset.
Some basic kitchen supplies mentioned on the website could not be found. Some descriptions on the web did not match reality including triple bunk bed size that is way smaller, so be aware when coming with kids.
In our case, there were no instructions (!) on how to operate the place, let alone recommendations on what to do in the neighborhood, town and resorts.
The sleeping area on the balcony is comfortable and the shower is clean and relaxing. After figuring out how to do it, the heating warms the place pretty well.
In summary, this basic hut maybe best for avid skiers who leave early and come back at night to sleep and watch a movie.
However, if your vacation includes an idea of being able to move freely, relax, and spending time to read and cook, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere."

Robert has done an amazing job renovating this old little cabin and adding in nice new amenities with a highly functional kitchen and bathroom. He had a french press, pots and pans, cast iron skillets, and everything you need to cook meals. The hot water tank was a new, energy efficient model, which means you can do dishes and take a shower without running out (I've lived in places without that!). It was absolutely spotless and very very clean when we came in, easing my mind about our stay during COVID-19.
I'll definitely be back again soon!"

He was a great host and responded to all of my questions very quickly. There are stairs leading down to The cabin and also steep stairs up to the loft. He was willing to keep the outdoor stairs shoveled to ensure access to the cabin. There are two parking spots up top which he also was willing to keep shoveled. The kitchen is small and clean. There is a double bed upstairs and three bunks downstairs. Plenty of space for an air bed in the downstairs bedroom. It’s a great space for a small group.

This is a unique neighborhood with mostly full-time residents that really make you feel at home. It was fun to be outside while everyone was digging out. The downstairs neighbor is really nice and helpful if you have a chance to run into him. Martin is super responsive and accommodating. Would highly recommend his place."

The kitchen was well supplied with pans and dishes, as well as plenty of spices. The home was spacious and had a large living area. The garage was tall enough for my SUV to fit easily with its roof box attached to the top. Overall it was a very nice stay in a quieter area of Truckee, and I would stay there again happily."

There was only 2 things i wasnt sure about when staying here and it was a downstairs neighbor and some siding that was missing in the master bathroom (couldve been in the middle of being replaced).
The neighbor wasnt a problem we just had to keep in mind being quiet as to not disturb them. The host was great and offered late check out and an additional night due to a winter storm on our check out day. Very responsive and understanding."

Stayed with kids","This place was great overall and I would recommend. The two decks are awesome and we had a great time sitting there at night to watch the stars. It was quite hot during the day since there is no AC, but according to the host it’s common for no AC in Truckee. We couldn’t get the fan working in the main room and many windows were missing screens so that made it a little tough to keep them open and avoid bugs. But those were minor issues since it cools down at night.
Location is convenient and near beach access and downtown Truckee.
Only thing that wasn’t clear originally in the listing but we learned as we were arriving is that there someone living in the basement. That entrance is completely separate so not a major issue, but if you need to access the washer/dryer it’s in the garage so you may bump into them since they access their unit from the garage."

Stayed a few nights","We loved Martin’s place in this beautiful area - we enjoyed trips to the lake and to Truckee. Martin was a really responsive host and his comms were always friendly.
The bedrooms and bathrooms were great as was the kitchen.
Really good to have a back and front balcony so we could avoid the sun ( it was extremely hot when we stayed). The lack of aircon was fine at night as the bedrooms had fans and it was much cooler over night. The only time we could have done with was if trying to cook in the evening however it truly was unexpectedly hot due to the heatwave.
In the evenings we sat on the front deck on the lovely furniture and watched for stars and the occasional deer that walked down the street.
We would recommend this place."

The house was in a quiet neighborhood and we did spot a few deers running around which our kids enjoyed watching. The time we visited was quite hot and the house did get warm in the afternoon since there is no AC. But by evening it would cool down. Martin had some portable fans available for hot days, which was very useful. Martin was very responsive when we had issues with turning on the ceiling fan and the TV. Access to Netflix and Hulu was great for us to watch some shows during the stay. The location is 15 mins from Truckee and 30 mins from King's beach which was ideal. Overall we had a great time at Martin's place and will definitely visit again."

Stayed with kids","The place was exactly as described. Instructions for checking in and out were clear and Martin was responsive with online messages as well as by phone. He was nice enough to offer another night due to weather conditions. We didn't have to worry about clearing the snow from the driveway as his neighbor across the street cleared the driveway for us not once, but twice in the morning due to heavy snow fall. Nothing was broken and everything was in working order.
To find something to improve on, I'd have to say the kitchen didn't have some items we were expecting it to have (baking sheet for the oven, large mixing bowl, steak knives, etc), but not too big of a deal as we made do and needing these items depends on what you're cooking. We had 5 children with us and some board games would have been nice, but again not a big deal as the TV had plenty of options for things to watch and outdoor play during the heavy snow fall was fun for them.
Overall, our stay was good."

We loved the rustic feel of the house and it was fun to hang out with everyone in the kitchen/living room. There was really nice, bright natural light during the day and it was helpful to have the bedrooms further down the hall so people didnt get woken up later at night and early in the morning, since we werent all on the same schedule. Heat worked really well. House was convenient to both cross country and downhill skiing (~30 min or less). Truckee has a cute town center and dining options--the downtown is several miles from the house."

Excellent communication before, during, and after the stay: Martin responded to all our questions right away. The place is close enough to Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake to serve as a base for visiting those attractions. The listing accurately described it as a good option for WFH away from the big city. It is in a quite residential neighborhood and we liked it The place is large and clean. It has the essentials for cooking a good meal, though some cookware, dinnerware, utensils, and sitting furniture can use some updates. Unlike a hotel room or an AirBnB place that is exclusively used for rentals, someone actually lives in this as home when it isn’t rented. It comes with the feel of a home and the big and small things come with a regular home. For that, we appreciate Martin’s hospitality."

I gave 4 stars only because there are people leaving downstairs in the independent unit, but every time they cook, all the smell and smoke comes right upstairs. It was pretty cold and we had to keep the windows open. Otherwise it was a very nice stay."

The house was comfortable for five of us, and super dog friendly (Martin's dog Hondo was a ten/ten in friendliness and cuteness). The house was well maintained and VERY clean upon our arrival and check in was easy as Martin sent all the instructions ahead of time. Location itself is close enough to Lake Tahoe and downtown is less than ten minutes away. We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely plan on coming back."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, everything was great at this Airbnb. Well decorated and clean. Toiletries provided were high quality. Hot tub was perfect and clean towels by the patio door was a nice touch.
My only complaint is upon leaving we checked the house book to make sure we turned the thermostat down to whatever the owners preferred and in the house book there was a list of checkout instructions, 3 of which included:
• Load all dirty dishes into dishwasher (START THEM)
• Bag and remove all trash from the home and place them in the bear box.
• Put dirty towels in the washer (start the washer)
I specifically do not book Airbnbs that include in their listing that I will need to do housework. I also wouldn’t expect an Airbnb that charged me a $325 cleaning fee to include these rules to be discovered right as we are leaving.
I hope Airbnb owners will get away from this practice of surprising their renters with housework. Just charge the appropriate cleaning fee and let your cleaning crew handle it."

We taught our niece how to ski at Tahoe Donner - such a great little hill for beginners.
We celebrated St Patrick's Day in the house and brought corned beef from home but completely forgot the slow cooker we had planned to pack. I was ready to run into town to buy one but the house had the perfect sized in the cupboard! All in all, it was an awesome little escape! :) Definitely would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Wonderful home ! We had 5 adults and 4 kids and with one sleeping on a couch and one up in the loft, this house worked great for us! We do think the pull out sofa should be in the living room but that is just our personal preference.
The garage was great to back our truck into and two other cars fit in the driveway.
Everything was immaculate and the decor aesthetically pleasing .
The 5pm check in time was a little late for us but we made it work and there is absolutely zero heat in the master bedroom and only a teeny sliver of heat in the master bathroom . The rest of the house was fine as far as heat and we ended up finding some space heaters in the house so we had those running in the master bedroom which worked great.
We loved how we could see the snow all around us like the house was in its own snow globe! The location is fantastic!
We never used the hot tub and gym that’s included as it’s 2 miles away and $17 per person per day per the gym when I called ."

Stayed with kids","Value: for the reduced $451 a night compared to $600ish was a good deal given how modern the renovations make the property and its location and the time in season.
Home: nice place, renovations have made it very appealing. Some examples of its age linger like few PowerPoints in rooms and large glass windows that allow in cold mainly in the master bedroom. Overall would stay there again.
VRA: Person using Airbnb chat was friendly at first and easy to talk to but over time discussions became uncomfortable. VRA 24/7 hotline was pointless and likely is more intended to give owners peace of mind then to give tenants quality service. Overall would not stay with VRA again.
Warning: property has large glass windows in the master bedroom which offer great views during the daylight but allow cold to transfer in at night. I have photo evidence of the temps up to 10F difference even with the furnace running, space heater and a electric fireplace running. We had a baby and were forced to leave"

We really liked the homeliness of the house which was well equipped with everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. We will definitely be looking to come back in future for another relaxing getaway!"

Stayed a few nights",This is a really nice place in a good location. Near to town and skiing but still far enough away that you feel like you are in the woods a bit. The host is great and was flexible about allowing us early check in. The place is new and spotless. Nice to have three bedrooms and two and a half baths. The kitchen is well stocked and has everything needed to cook nice meals. Highly recommend.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay. The location couldn't have been better, especially for avid skiers like us. The house was close Sugarbowl and Northstar ski resorts. The garage was also tall and could fit an SUV with ski racks.
The layout of the house was great, with the bedrooms located upstairs. This was perfect for our group, as some of us are early risers and could easily prepare breakfast or chat downstairs without disturbing those still upstairs.
The only downside was the noise from the nearby train that passed through the city of Truckee. It's something to consider if you're a light sleeper or have young children (we didn't have a problem)."

The location is great in terms of peace and quiet while still being close to the resorts. The house itself is very clean and warm! We drove up with 3 wheel chair users, and Angela answered any accessibility questions that I had."

The place is exactly as described, and while the location is nothing exiting from a walk-around-the-neighborhood perspective, it's peaceful, private, and easy access to anything in and around Truckee. Would and probably will stay there again."

Conveniently located to downtown Truckee, Northstar and Palisades Ski Resorts, Angela's home is very clean, comfortable, nicely furnished, well equipped and perfectly accommodated our group of 5 on our recent 2-day ski trip. We wished we could stay longer, both for the wonderful skiing conditions and for the great place to stay.
Angela is a very responsive host and communicator. Had we needed anything more for our stay, we have no doubt Angela would have been on top of it to ensure our continued comfort and enjoyment!
We hope to stay again someday!"

Very well stocked and Angela was super communicative, very proactive in communicating with me as far as snow plowing and such. Thank your this very memorable vacation!

Stayed a few nights","I’d started to lose faith in Air BnB places and then we stayed here. It is, by far, the nicest place we’ve ever rented. Ever. Not only is the description on point, even when describing the potential negatives, like noise from the train, the photos are actually accurate and do it justice. It was genuinely spotless, and we felt very at home because of thoughtful details like throw blankets in the living room, Qtips in the bathroom, and 100% cotton sheets. After a long day of travel, I could have cried when I slipped in to bed and felt not only a heavy down-filled duvet, but silky soft cotton sheets. No slippery, sweat-producing polyester. The decor was tasteful and unique, not like an IKEA display room, but like something I’d like to see in my own home. Truly, the only thing I think that needs to be added to the home is a hammock on the grassy backyard so you can nap and listen to the Truckee River. A wonderful place to stay, indeed."

Group trip",The home is spectacular however we felt monitored and policed by our host. The first night we got a call regarding noise (we are all in our 50’s and this was a first fir me) The next afternoon our hosts showed up next door stating they were “checking on the new Gardner” she started cleaning the towels empty drinks and sunscreen from the lake area while my friends were still in the lake .. We of course had everyone intention of cleaning when we went back inside but the vibe we got made us feel as though we were not trusted. I have a perfect rating as a guest in the 10+ years I have been using Airbnb so this was very disappointing. Also we were required to strip the beds start laundry and dishes with a 10am checkout.. So a very late checkin and to me an early checkout. Again the place is gorgeous but would not stay again due to the host.

Throughout the years, we’ve stayed at Air BnB homes near Northwoods, Tahoe City, Alpine Meadows, Incline Village and Alpine Meadows. By far, our favorite home has been Yvette’s because of of several factors:
• Walking distance to downtown Truckee
• View of Truckee River
• Access to Palisades & Sugar Bowl
• Cleanliness (loved that)
I just wished we had booked 1 extra night but would recommend to stay minimum (3) nights.

Specifically- There is a 2 person bedroom (one bed) and bath on the main floor, so it is easy for those of us at a certain age. A large bed downstairs worked well for my 6' 5"" adult son. The kitchen has everything we needed and we cooked at home most nights. I love to cook and was happy that there are measuring cups, cheese graters, and really everything I needed. The living room is cozy with a great deck and view of the river. The TV is huge which my hubby liked. In addition, the whole home was super clean! There was absolutely nothing lacking, and I really appreciate Yvette and her husband for making this such a treat! A+++++++++++++++"

Stayed with kids","Yvette and Jeff’s place was beautifully decorated and the amenities were great. Coffee pods, laundry pods and very comfortable beds were highly appreciated. Great location close to everything you need in Truckee! Access to the mountain was awesome on weekdays and on the weekend if you get out before 8 am. Would definitely stay in Truckee at this beautiful, well-appointed home again!!"

Stayed a few nights",Stayed in Truckee for my girlfriends birthday and this home was perfect for a little getaway. The location is top notch - we walked everywhere. It was pretty cold but the walk to our dinners and shopping were less than 5 minutes. The setting was fantastic with the river out back. We truly loved this house and location and would love to stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Yvette and Jeff’s house over the weekend for a round of golf and Barracuda championship in beautiful Truckee city. The house is clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated, same or even better than the photos on Airbnb site. The house is at the front of crystal clear Truckee river and conveniently located within walking distance of Truckee downtown.
Yvette and Jeff are the super hosts in deed. When we arrived at Friday evening, we found that we could not start the air conditioner. We called Yvette, she immediately sent someone over to look into the issue and sent 4 fans. When it became apparent that the issue can’t be fixed over the weekend, Jeff came over and installed two brand new portable air conditioner and sent us reasonable refund. We enjoyed our stay at this house and really appreciated Yvette and Jeff’s effort to make our stay comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","The title says it all- it really doesn’t get any better than this house! Everything is new, super clean and tastefully decorated. We were so happy and comfortable in this home. We enjoyed being so close to downtown as we could walk to all the shops and restaurants. Having the Truckee river right in our backyard was amazing. We also felt the cost for such a nice home was well worth it. These hosts have thought of every detail. Best rental experience we’ve had. Don’t hesitate- just book it!

Stayed a few nights","It really doesn't get any better. It's perfect!
We are lucky to be the first guests staying at Yvette's Truckee riverfront house.
The place is immaculate, and it has everything you need for a comfortable stay. We loved the direct access to the Truckee river right in the backyard. The house is also just a few minutes from the Old Town area, with some of the best restaurants and coffee shops in the Tahoe area.
Yvette is a very caring and thoughtful host. We can't wait to come back again."
