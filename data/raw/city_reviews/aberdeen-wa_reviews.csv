Stayed a few nights","To Bayou (their dog) and of course, Emily and Ash. Thank you for having such a beautiful property. The magical trails, trees, chickens, gardens, birds and wildlife were stunning! Such a private peaceful place to stay. All the amenities provided - including coffee! (Every morning a coffee in hand and a walk through the woods.) Comfortable beds and an overall welcoming, homey feeling in the house. Highly recommend if you want to stay away from it all, yet only 45 minutes to the coast. We made fast buddies with Bayou the energetic dog and Emily our host was super friendly and also let us experience the place on our own. Thank you again!"

Stayed with a pet","We had a last minute cancelation and we're lucky enough to find this listing. The area is very quiet and we were happy to see all of the deer in the area. The home was spacious and well furnished. There was a lot of extra amenities inside the home like movies for example, and you just felt like you were at home. We did get a visit from their dog on one of the days and he was so friendly :). We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Good place to stay, 3 bedrooms plus a room that works for someone to sleep in. Good proximity to several rivers. A bit of a drive to the beaches, but if you're looking at a map you already know that. Parking is a little tight if you have a boat (drift boater here), but functional. They used to supply a hose, but didn't on my most recent trip, I'm not sure if that's seasonal (it was October) or just a change, but if you've got a boat to wash between trips, there is a spigot, you might need to bring your own hose though."

Stayed with a pet","This is a slice of paradise nestled in the mountains. The location is wonderful. It sits at the top of a hill overlooking a valley and other hills. It is great to watch the fog and rain roll in. The sunrises are beautiful and the star gazing is great on clear nights. Walking through the forest trails was just breathtaking.
When walking into the home, it felt like walking back into my childhood home. It is a very cozy home that has some great reading areas. It was very clean and fully equipped for our two week stay. The Wi-Fi was on the slow side, but my kids were still able to do a little gaming. Tmobile has very spotty service there.
The hosts were amazing. They are next door, but give you your privacy. They were very friendly and took care of the two issues we had immediately. Their dogs were just as great. Even though our dogs are not sociable with other dogs, the hosts were very mindful of theirs while we had ours out.
We did not want to leave and would love to return."

The location is beautiful and private but also close enough to all the surrounding amenities. Their home brings almost a nostalgia feeling over you when you walk inside, like visiting grandmas on a Sunday afternoon when you were a kid, to a time more simple, with It’s humble decor and cozy feel. The home is stocked with most all you’ll need for your stay, be it cooking supplies or just most every day needs (shampoo, soap etc). If you’re looking for a place to unwind from this fast paced world, a safe haven or even just a place to stay while exploring the surrounding outdoors, this is the place for you!"

Stayed with a pet","Emily and Ash’s place is the perfect retreat from the city. My partner, dog, and I spent a relaxing weekend here, enjoying the trails on the property and the views of the surrounding hills and forests. Emily and Ash gave us a great beach recommendation and we avoided the crowds at Ocean Shores and headed to Copalis Beach instead. What a gem! We walked over the dunes and onto an expansive stretch of shoreline with hardly any people.
Emily, Ash, and their pup Bayou were fantastic hosts. Their house is super cute and such a bargain for the area. We hope to be back!"

Stayed with a pet","If you’re someone who enjoys exploring the outdoors, two nights here simply isn’t enough!
Starting off with the home and property itself—the home is incredibly comfortable and homey, clean, and surprisingly spacious. There was more than enough room for myself, my husband, and our 50-pound dog. We cooked two dinners here and the kitchen was functional and had all of the basics we needed (pots, pans, cooking utensils, olive oil, salt and pepper, aluminum foil, etc). The bed was comfortable and we both slept very well. The Wifi worked great. Many movies on DVDs available or you can watch Netflix!
The property, well, what is there not to love about it? It’s quiet and private, and there is so much wide open space surrounding the home and trails to explore in the forest. Our dog had a blast and I’m sure was sorely disappointed when we came back to our home with a significantly smaller yard :) the sunsets were super pretty. We used the fire pit very briefly, but I bet it would be even more fun to use during the colder months!
The location is great if you enjoy exploring the outdoors, though we didn’t have quite enough time to take advantage of it. You’re about an hour away from sandy beaches that are relatively quiet during a weekday and many, many places to go hiking. Lake Sylvia State Park is only 15 minutes away if you want to do a quick 1.5 loop around the lake! If you plan on cooking, I would make sure to plan ahead of time as I think the closest major grocery store (Safeway) is about 20 minutes away.
Emily was such a wonderful host, so friendly, and we enjoyed chatting with her. And of course, there is Bayou who befriended our dog instantly and made our trip so memorable. We hope to be back someday!"

Stayed with a pet","We enjoyed our stay (part 2 of 2). We did lots of hiking and exploring from here. Up to waterfall hikes past Wynoochee lake, the beach, the Quinault, staircase area near lake cushman, trails in Lake Sylvia State Park and the Capitol State Forest, a little trout fishing at the Queets river in the national park. Did a sail on Lady Washington on the lower part of the Chehalis river. Dinners in Montesano and Aberdeen or at the airbnb. The split living room areas were quite nice to spread out to have our own spaces when we did a little bit of remote work. More trails behind the house continue for quite a way beyond the property."

We loved sitting out in the yard with the view of the hills on the opposite side. Plenty of room for a volleyball ball net, or some other outdoor games. The trails out in the trees made hiking fun too. We were a group of 7 and had plenty of room to stretch out. Nice private setting with the owners close by. We enjoyed our stay. :)"

Group trip","This was the perfect place to stay for our family getaway. My in-laws were in town and I wanted them to see the coast and rainforest as they’ve never been in Washington before. This was a great spot for all 7 of us. It’s a little like glamping so keep that in mind, some nature bugs and no air conditioning. Washington usually stays cool so that’s not often a problem but it was hot this weekend so best to stay out during the day and then just open the windows at night and let that fresh cool breeze in. The yard was amazing and they had all the dishes and amenities you could want. They are also friendly but respectful. Overall good experience!"

Stayed over a week","Yes, it is a bit long in the tooth - quite dated and visibly worn. What it lacks in elegance it more than makes up for in warmth, coziness, quiet, peace.
Don’t except modern minimalism, but do expect comfortable beds, fluffy towels, warmth from a pellet stove, and everything you need in the kitchen.
It’s clean, quiet, private and has easy access to hikes in the woods, coastal beaches, and local dining/amenities.
Entirely dog-friendly. Our canine family members were in dog bliss."

Group trip","Emily and her husband were absolutely lovely hosts. I felt absolutely at home in their place. The house is well built, the kitchen was stocked, and it was great how warm the place was kept. They did everything they could to make us feel welcomed there. My only wish was that there was a plug so I could take a nice warm bath haha.
Our car couldn't make it up the driveway due to ice and snow but they drove on down in their truck and helped carry all our luggage from the car. That is A+ hospitality right there.
The property was absolutely beautiful too. I explored it the moment I got there and I was surprised how much there was to see there. The paths were clearly marked even when covered in snow. My friend and I did a little night hike too and it was easy to follow along (Emily if you saw lights outside in the woods that was us being weirdos haha)
I enjoyed everything so much that I felt like I wasn't doing enough in return to show my appreciation. I hope I can come back one day and stay there even longer, bring my family this time so they can experience it.
Thank you guys for the lovely stay!"

It was clean, homely, and everything we were hoping for on our trip. It's remote but not far from a couple towns, wooded with some trails, spacious for dogs to run and exert their excessive energy, has a nice table for board games, and even has a fire pit which we sadly couldn't put to use this trip as it was raining fairly heavily in the evenings but that's beside the point. Great stay, would greatly enjoy coming back in the future."

Stayed with kids","If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing location with incredible views, beautiful forested trails, and incredibly accommodating hosts, then do yourself a favor and immediately book this property. Emily and Ash are wonderful hosts and I would not hesitate to rent their property for my next visit to the PNW. The location is outstanding! You feel as though you are miles from civilization, but you are just a short drive to a grocery store, banks, and some really nice restaurants. The Wynoochee River is even closer. I cannot stress how beautiful and quiet this property is. We have not slept that well in a long, long, time!
Thank you, Emily and Ash for your understanding with our little emergency. We hope to be back again without the calamity!"

Stayed with kids",The Angler Lodge was a delight. There were beautifully maintained wooded trails beyond the meadow. Our dogs were huge fans of running through the meadow chasing each other. The lodge was perfect for our whole family with great bedrooms and comfy seats all over. We loved playing family games on the porch with ferns and beautiful foxglove nearby. Our host was absolutely wonderful from the moment we booked till we said goodbye. She was so prompt to respond to any questions or comments we had. We also noticed that the lodge was spotless throughout. I would recommend this stay to anyone or book another stay in a heartbeat. Thanks for a relaxing weekend!

The location isn't far from groceries stores and places to grab food. The drive up to the home is lovely. The views in the morning are beautiful and it's very peaceful.
We were able to have our dog run around off-leash and through the trails. It was absolutely gorgeous. Even with the rain, it was a comfortable stay. The place was extremely clean and there was coffee and some snacks available. There was everything you needed to cook and the bathrooms were fully stocked."

It was incredible to stay here with zero noise level. We didn’t even realize the hosts live across the driveway until a day later as we left for a daytrip to the coast.
A great getaway from the city and it’s noise pollution. We could probably literally hear a pin drop from across the valley."

Stayed over a week",It was over priced it was not presented well. If I would have known the shower/tub was in the living room I would not have booked the stay. I literally had to stand on a chair to get in and out the shower it was unsafe. It was not in a safe location it was a lot of homeless individuals in the area. There was a notice placed on the door for non payment for water service. I would never try to interfere with someone source of income but this is false advertising several other people left notes inside of shed/cottage about how they were unhappy with their stay.

Stayed a few nights",Other than a scary location and no bathroom vanity (only a toilet)- it was a cute place with a full sized w/d and free standing tub. My suggestion is not to check in after dark because it’s difficult to see the lockbox and the alleyway is not the best at part of town. It would be an appropriate deal if priced less. Room was clean and made comfortable. The mattress wasn’t the best but acceptable for a short stay.

Stayed one night","The Rest Stop was a good one-night stay during our trip.
The cottage was clean and efficient; the bed was comfortable and the towels and linens were nice quality.
Since we only stayed overnight, we didn’t use any of the kitchen equipment. But we did appreciate having coffee supplied for the morning. We were carrying our own food and appreciated a larger refrigerator.
We had our little dog with us and it was really nice to have the small fenced back yard to let him out later at night.
The cottage is down an alley and within a block of commercial buildings. The neighborhood was older with many houses/buildings that were in need of repair, however, I felt comfortable walking my dog around the neighborhood in the morning.
I would recommend The Rest Stop."

The studio has everything you need, well equipped kitchen area with a stove/oven, nice big fridge, claw foot tub with a nice shower, great washer and dryer, comfy bed and chairs, table and chairs. Nicely done studio with cute decor and touches. We especially enjoyed the AC, it was a hot August weekend. Nice to have a yard too. We will return when in the area."

The cottage is small but very clean and cozy. Casey answered my text quickly. The backyard was not usable as it is but maybe Casey has plans to fix it up to match the cottage. But we loved the space and will rent again when we come back this way. Good deal for $$.

Stayed a few nights","We appreciated the stay here in Hoquiam. It was easy to find, quiet and met most of our needs. We love to cook while on the road, and this rental seems to be a new offering in the rental market without a few things that would have made our stay a little easier (there is no salt/pepper/oil, despite it being mentioned in the listing). Still, the space worked well enough for us, with a little juggling. There are not blackout blinds (as mentioned in ad), just blinds that let a lot of nighttime lights through into the bed area, especially around the window AC unit. The shower head/wand was nice and water pressure and temp were all great. The shower curtains tended to stick to your body, giving very little room to actually maneuver in the shower. I understand there are quite limited accommodations in this area, so I understand why the price is higher than other parts of the country where we have stayed. Our host was very friendly and the flowers left for us were a lovely touch."

I ended up finding this rental with the option for a longer stay and I was not disappointed one bit. We had the best experience and had no issues with our stay. We ended up extending our stay while we searched for a home with a bigger yard for our dogs because of how at home we felt there. We always had positive interactions with Christy. She was super helpful any time we needed anything. We ended up finding a house to rent that accepted pets but If that wouldn't have worked out I would have gladly stayed at the launch pad apartment with another extension.
It's a great option for a few days and very cozy if you are looking for a longer stay."

Stayed one night","We definitely would not have stayed here if we had known about the location. It was a little scary. We arrived very late and I would have left to find a hotel if it had been earlier. The pictures make this place look like an upscale modern apartment. It is not. It’s part of a house in a sketchy neighborhood with dilapidated homes all around. There were spiders on the ceiling, multiple hairs on the threadbare linens, dried food on the kitchen table, and hair in the shower. Have they updated the place? Yes and I’m sure it was an improvement. The floors are nice, the living room furniture is nice and there is a new washer and dryer, decent microwave and very clean oven. I believe they are trying to make this a nice place but it’s not there yet. More care needs done on the cleaning. Unfortunately the location is what it is.
After washing the sheets (and still finding hair in them) we finally laid down around midnight only to be awoken at 5 am to pulsating bass rap music. Disappointing stay."

Stayed one night","Overall, our stay was okay. I gave the Airbnb three stars for the following reasons:
The location did not feel all that safe. The houses around the AirBnb were fairly run-down. There was a van in our parking lot with a smashed out window. There was a spray-painted sign nearby that read, ""Please don't park here to score your meth."" Someone knocked on our door in the evening, and when I opened it, no one was there. The host has done a good job making the space inside feel homey, but the neighborhood is rough.

The space is advertised as being available for a party of three, but there is only one bed, and the loveseat does not pull out into a bed. The listing is accurate in that it mentions only one bed, but typically, that means there is a third place to sleep somewhere.
When checking the loveseat to see if it was a pullout, I found the interior covered in dog hair, which really brought down my confidence that the space was clean.
Overall, the value was good. If you don't mind staying in a rougher neighborhood, this is a good option. The host is responsive. Check-In was very easy. Much of the interior looked recently renovated. This just probably isn't an Airbnb I'd return to personally."

We did ask for some but by the time we had been relayed too we had already we and bought a blanket. (The Host did say she was busy cleaning when we messaged her) it was about 4 or 5 hours later that we got a reply. The apartment was clean but it didn’t feel to comfortable to be honest. Maybe with some suggestions like a new mattress and more blankets this place could be an alright stay. Not to mention there was a sign across the street that said “ DONT PARK HERE TO SCORE YOUR METH” that’s the Neighborhood I guess. I was ready to leave when the time came. I really don’t want to sound like a jerk because I think this place has potential. Just wanted to give the people paying an honest review of the place.

It was only 30 min to the ocean, Christy was able to let me check in early to get settled in before heading to the beach, she cleaned up very nicely, and it included all the amenities I could have possibly needed! Yes the neighborhood is a little run down. But that wouldn’t stop me from staying again :) everything was easy and pleasant. Oh and having a washer and drying! After playing at the beach that was so appreciated!!"

Other than that one night stay was more than enough for me."

Stayed one night","Great communication which is really important. They are quick to respond and are very generous. Never made me feel like I was being annoying or needy when I had questions or requests, which I really appreciate. The space is quite small, but very cute and stylish. I would suggest this Airbnb only for a couple because of how small it is and since there is only one queen bed. Loved my time here nonetheless. I will say, try to get in and out as quickly as possible when entering and leaving the home because although this is a pet-friendly Airbnb which I’m grateful for, both neighbors on each side have very yappy dogs. One of the neighbor’s dog was extremely loud and seemed aggressive although he kept saying his dog “just wanted to play” with my puppy. He would try and shut his dog up though which was appreciated."

Exactly as pictured! One of the light bulbs was burnt out in the room our daughter slept in and without even asking, as we were fine with it, we were brought a new lightbulb!

Stayed with kids","Best feature of the house was the hot tub looking out on the river. The beds were comfortable and the in wall room heaters kept every room cozy, especially the bathrooms.
We did not realize from the pictures that only one room of the house (a bedroom) has views of the river. The enclosed back porch with a dining room table has great views of the river, but it's also where the washer and it is not heated or cooled, so it was not really usable for us. The kitchen also needs a few more pots, pans, and utensils to make it really usable.
The road noise from the hwy could have been an issue--but we travel with sound machines."

Stayed a few nights","Great place! It was great and accurately described by both the hosts and the other guests. Noise from the 101 was noticeable inside the house but nothing that would keep a normal person up at night. Hot tub was super clean and set at perfect temperature, which was one of the main reasons we booked this place. Only a 25 min drive to the coast, which was also convenient. Hoquiam Brewery is a great spot if your looking for some beer and decent food fare.
A few other items that we noticed that I think are worth mentioning: 1. There aren't a ton of electrical outlets and several of the ones that are there are 2 pronged. 2. There is a K-Cup coffee maker but no drip or french press that we could find. 3. Would recommend bringing some extra cookware if you plan to be cooking for several. Enough utensils but glad we brought some extra mixing bowls and trays. None of these items are negatives but just some additional conveniences to mention, depending on what you plan on doing."

Highly recommend any of their properties!! This time Christy was especially helpful in making sure my arrangement between two of there listings was simplified. She moved me to a nicer unit for less than the original and welcomed my huge family into their adorable waterfront cabin for my final nights stay. Accommodating me with two late checkouts. Not that I would expect that every time but just giving her a nod that they are so willing to accommodate in every way possible. We had the best family get together. I was able to reunite my sister and dad after 8 years. 💗

Stayed with kids","The cottage is very private, cozy, clean, and beautifully decorated. The view of the river was stunning. The hosts were gracious and let us check in early--they even pitched to help the cleaning ladies to accommodate us! They also were very kind and prompt with communications.
Two things dampened our experience. 1) The beds were very hard and heavily scented with perfume. We all woke up with headaches, body pains, and very drained. 2. The property is right along highway 101, so traffic was extremely loud and ruined the illusion of secludedness. Most of the time, we could barely hear the nature around us. The disclaimer in the description should better describe the extent of the noise situation.
Improvement ideas: Add a fire pit, picnic table, and hammock to make hanging outside a little more inviting. Make the bed with river view a king size and add black out curtains. For the kitchen, add two frying pans and cooking spray.
We enjoyed our stay tho. Thanks for having us!!"

Stayed with kids","We were on the last leg of our PNW trip and needed a place to stay that evening. Casey responded back quickly-which was appreciated as we were driving down 101 with no plans yet and we were able to head straight to the property. We loved the privacy fence. Once we drove in and closed the gate we felt like we had our own little oasis. The house is adorable and the layout is unique which we enjoyed! The glass french doors and the views of the windows from the second bedroom and the back end of the house were so beautiful. We celebrate our five year old's birthday and took a few dips in the hot tub-which was so private and relaxing. Tv's in all the bedrooms allowed the girls to watch a show while mom and dad enjoyed an adult movie too. This was a beautiful and relaxing stay right off 101. It's quiet even though it is right by the hwy and we felt at home the instant we walked in. There are grocery stores right down the road in town there, which makes this a perfect stop while traveling."

Stayed with kids","This looks like a nicely updated home on a scenic river in the photos, but it's really just an old house painted white with a lament wood floor thrown down. It's right on the freeway, so it's loud, and the pictures of the surroundings don't match the reality. The sheets in on bedroom were not clean, and we had to do laundry before we could use the master bedroom. I received several bites on my legs from some insect while sleeping. When we arrived the owner was there finishing cleaning, meaning we could settle in for half an hour after our arrival. With better cleanliness and a lower price this could be a decent stay if you're traveling in the area, but it's not worth going out of your way to stay here."

Stayed a few nights","THE GOOD:
Christy is probably the most solution oriented, responsive and nice host I have ever met. It didn't matter if it was the property, the electrical utility, my fault, whatever was going on Christy was completely on top of it
The beds are cozy and I got great sleep on less noisy nights.
THE LESS GOOD:
I come to this area for work so my intent was not a retreat, but with the hot tub picture, the title of the post and reviews I think my expectations were too high This spot IS better than some local alternatives but to call it a ""retreat"" is stretching it.
Specifically:
- Standing in the dark/mud puddles trying to unlock/lock the gate every day was ridiculously awkward
-Road noise is pretty intense
-Area does not feel particularly safe for a single woman traveling alone
-Motion lights/trees banging on house/utility outage kept me up
- House loses heat quickly
-Many small home repair issues (kitchen sink handle falling off) made cleaning up every day annoying"

The house lies just off the main highway, so you do have noise from that. We usually sleep with a noise machine anyways so that didn't bother us. The house was comfortable and had everything we needed for a quick over night stay. Our overall favorite part of this house was the views of the river! It's very lovely sitting in the hot tub looking out at nature, or sitting in the covered patio space having a cup of coffee.
Communication is easy and quick with the hosts."

Stayed a few nights","This river home has a very convenient location and had everything my family needed for a comfortable stay. The house is minutes away from the city center, but far enough away so that you can see the starry sky clearly. One of my favorite memories from my entire trip was drinking coffee in the morning on the back porch and watching river otters and even a seal swim by! So cool.
A few things to note as you plan for your stay is that the traffic along the roadway has a steady sound, but the entire property is fenced in and the location on the river along with the beautiful home makes it worth it. Also, there is a futon in the home that allows for a third sleeping area option.
You will be glad to stay here if you have the chance! Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights",Cute spot! If you want a hidden gem close to the coast I highly reccomend this spot. Yes its right off the freeway but as soon as you close that gate you forget where you are. Great for a weekend getaway with your partner or friends. The hot tub was my favorite part. Casey communicated the whole time and made everything really easy.

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay.
I was a little bit worried about the noise coming from the road, but I couldn’t here anything from inside and also the noise wasn’t bothering at all while enjoying the jacuzzi.
We all slept like a baby. The bed was so comfortable that I fell asleep within a second. There were plenty of clean pillows and blankets.
They prepared the jacuzzi for us so all we had to do was just shower and then enjoy (with a great and peaceful view).
The host was very nice and considerate. Having a conversation with her made me smile as I could feel her kindness over the text! :)
I’d love to stay here again in the future. Thank you again!"

I didn't use the 2nd bedroom or bathroom at all, but can appreciate how useful the 1:1 ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms could be had more folks been in my party!
As someone who often struggles to feel comfortable away from home, I truly appreciate the sense of safety and comfort this location offered.

I loved the modern furniture and equipment, the bed was comfortable, everything was clean. I am not a fan of hot tubs, but this one was so clean and ready to dive in, that we made it, we dived in and it was so pleasant. The location by the river is good. Would be better to have at least a small beach, but for just a weekend that was great enough."

Sitting in the private hot tub under the stars was absolutely amazing . And laying in bed watching out the window and seeing the beautiful river and wildlife right there was fabulous. They truly have it all board games , outdoor games, camping chairs, cooking pots and pans , utensils, even spices and coffee, extra blankets etc. If you need it they got it. All you need to visit is a reservation and yourself . Make sure you stay at least 2 nights cause your not going to want to leave I promise. You won’t be sorry 😊"

When we came across this nice and clean Airbnb with a hot tub on a water front, we were sold! With but a few hours notice, Christy had accepted our stay.
I wish we would have decided to stay another night or two, because we didn’t even use the house to half it’s capabilities. But the potential to relax, rest, cook, and work would bring me back in a heartbeat, even on the long term!
The couple of things we had questions on were quickly answered via text message, which was provided upon check in. It was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the A/C is a bonus on the hot days but would cool down enough with just the windows opened on a cool night.
I would come back to Washington JUST to stay here for a bit! 🖤"

There is also no outdoor lighting except the flood lights which are temporary. There is no safe way down to the river. The tiles on the wall were falling off and the very clear markings of where the bricks fell off were simply painted over and not repaired, there was a odd smell in the house and I did not feel comfortable using really anything. As soon as we arrived we wanted to leave"

Stayed about a week","Nice place with a beautiful river frontage. Great for watching the river critters and the tides change from the cute little hot tub on the back deck or the enclosed back porch. Plenty of space for 2 couples, big kitchen with basic amenities, and decent beds/bedding. Easy drive to Lake Quinalt for hiking, etc., and to the beautiful beaches, so this is a good base for exploring the area.
This property is on US 101 and immediately across the street from a rock/landscape supply place, so be sure to bring ear plugs because there is a LOT of noise from the traffic and the big machines across the road (during work hours).
Casey was easy to communicate with and check-in/out processes were clear and easy to follow."

Stayed with kids","Safety concerns! We had a ping pong ball roll under the dresser in the bedroom downstairs and when I slid it forward to retrieve the ball, the mirror was NOT attached and fell forward-I caught one end and the other landed on the Kleenex box on the other end of the dresser thankfully. I am thankful my 8 year didn't attempt to move that dresser to retrieve it. There were SO. MANY. cobwebs and dust behind the dresser.
2. Wifi didnt work. I advised host and 4 hours later I finally asked where the modem/router was to try unplugging (which worked). Filthy under bed where it was located.
3. Weeds overgrowing everywhere, through cracks in the sidewalk, all along parking space (almost 4 feet high).
4. Neighbors house and fence is in complete disrepair and is just feet from the home, fence falling in back yard. The host should put up window dressings on ALL windows.
5. Very dusty everwhere, filthy oven drawer with so many crumbs of food.
6. Strange bricks in front of door"

Jeffrey made our first bnb experience a very pleasant one. We already plan on renting from him on all our trips to aberdeen. We felt he deserves more than just 5 stars.

Very clean, with plenty of extras like books, games, wii. Quiet cute neighborhood. My favorite was the electric fireplace, it made the house feel so cozy! The first night there was a deer in the backyard. I highly recommend Jeffry's place!"

Stayed about a week","Jeffry is one of the best hosts I have has for the last several years of using Airbnb. He is an excellent and prompt communicator and has put a lot into making this house welcoming. The kitchen was stocked up with more than any other rental kitchen with generous gifts of a dozen organic eggs, two types of cheeses, condiments, and a tea and coffee station with various choices. In addition, he had a variety of snacks, can and box foods, and frozen foods for our use. The space was bright, with lots of windows and comfortable furnishing. There were plenty of towels and other supplies.
The house is 100 years old, and as much as it has been renovated, there are little things that should be expected from an old house, but these were minor. Unfortunately, the neighborhood is made up of old houses, some of which are in very poor repair. We found this to be true for most of Aberdeen. Obviously, this is out of the host's control, but it is important to mention."

We had everything we needed and plenty of space for everyone. Skip had left detailed instructions for almost everything and had even left a few snacks in the refrigerator for guests. We had a great time staying here. It felt very much like home. Skip is clearly an animal lover. He welcomed our cats who were attending a local TICA show. We had already dealt with one cancelation, and we all know how difficult it can be to find a place that will take our pets when we travel. We would stay here again without a doubt.
Also, my teen unknowingly left a few belongings at the house, and Skip messaged us to ensure that we could connect again to retrieve our items. He greeted us outdoors and was very friendly."

The whole house was extremely clean and somehow both spacious and cozy at the same time. We only stayed one night because we were just passing through so we didn't get a chance to use the foosball table or any of the recommendations. We would stay here again.

Stayed one night","If you need a place to stay in this area this is a very good choice. The house was clean and everything was exactly as pictured. My partner liked the charm of a 94 year old home. It was a comfortable place to stay and it was quiet. There were quirky things like the christmas tree still up in the corner and the fully wood paneled bathroom. My family felt like we were staying at grandmas house.
Two things that people should know is
1. You will share the laundry room with the owners. We were fine with it but it is not as private as expected. They do come in the house to do laundry.
2. Also, most everything is ten minutes or more away. Just be prepared that the town is sleepy. We were super happy with that, but it’s just an fyi.
Overall it was a good stay for us and the home served us well. The owner was incredibly responsive and kind. There was water and yogurt in the fridge when we arrived, very thoughtful."

I thought the price was great as there are very few private residences to stay at in that area. Montesano is quiet, safe, and beautiful and I prefer it over most other towns in the area. There are lots of outdoor activities and restaurants nearby.
If I’m in the area and Skip’s place is available, I will book it without hesitation."

Stayed one night","This was a very normal experience. I rent a lot of AirBnB and VRBO I was not disappointed but not impressed either. In the future I would not try to rent this place again, but if it was my only option I would not avoid it either. I feel like the deal was on the expensive side for a property like this but that makes sense this close to Spring Break, most places are inflated by a lot during that time. I hope to see this place much less expensive in the future which would make me seek it out to rent again. A huge perk for us was the abandoned nuclear plant on the hill. It was extremely interesting to tour and take pictures of. I think perhaps this was not mentioned because it could potentially scare people. But when you see it looming on the hill it is a little scary anyway. Only after you know the story does it seem cool and not scary."

The beds were a little warm which wasn’t ideal for the summer but seems like they would be really cozy in the winter and with a fan it was pretty comfortable. Despite the heat (mid to high 80s all weekend) the whole house was very comfortable even without AC. Overall this was a really nice place to stay and I would definitely book here again.

Wonderful kitchen to cook in and had everything we needed. Lovely comfortable furnishings and the beds were great, we slept so hard. The house is in a very quite location. The large deck and yard was the very best part, so pretty, like a park. Our 2 border collies had a great time out there and we enjoyed hanging out on the deck with them, with a cup coffee. One of our very best Airbnb experiences."

That to me is just absurd. Needless to say, that was the only downfall. Super cute house, awesome location (our daughter loved seeing the deer in the yard pretty much every day we were there), very spacious."

Stayed with kids","The people who came when we checked out we’re super nice and patient as we tried as quick as possible to load up seven children. The friendly folks were hard workers, and clearly care about cleanliness, which is fantastic. We witnessed them pulling out, mattresses to clean the floors, and spray disinfectant onto mattresses which I thought was impressive !
We did, however accidentally leave my husband’s wallet in the home. We know this due to Apple AirTag and have had difficulty getting it back. Still have not gotten it back and the communication with whoever the owner is or responds to the Airbnb has been slow. I asked if I could go back and get it on our way home, but didn’t get a response until we were already home and are being asked to pay for shipping and the housekeepers time to mail the wallet. Shipping is understandable but seems a bit much to make me pay for the time to mail it especially since the AirTag says it’s in the home."

Stayed a few nights","Jethro dog and I stayed for my b-day weekend. This place was way beyond what I expected. The extra little amenities were wonderful. The decor was so cool! Every time I looked around again, I saw a decoration that was new to me. I loved sitting out in back, or under the covered porch when it rained, while Jethro was able to freely roam in the totally enclosed yard. It is close to Westport (Merino's, yum) and Bay City Sausage (nom, nom, nom). It even had a path/stairs, down the bluff, to the water. This is truly the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at! I'm already planning for our next stay at this location. Thank you for allowing us to share your place."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at the Bay City cottage was relaxing and peaceful. Entering the property, I immediately felt at ease about our dog's safety (no holes or gaps in the fully fenced yard). The inside of the cottage was cozy and comfortable for both humans and canines. It was especially thoughtful to find single-use dog toys in the closet, as well as many other dog-related items: furniture coverings, food/water bowls, waste bags, towels and more. The cottage location is ideal for area explorations (Westport, ocean beaches, state parks, Cranberry Museum, etc.). We enjoyed neighborhood walks and area bike rides (there is ample room to safely store bikes under cover near the cottage). The outdoor space at the cottage is inviting and I frequently found myself sitting in the backyard, gazing out at the Elk River estuary. Upon departure, we discussed when we could make our next visit! Thank you Laura and Jon!"

Stayed with a pet","Our stay was 4 days, 3 nights in May. We were lucky enough to go during minus tides & great weather so we could enjoy the dynamic activity of the inlet and marshlands. The cabin is older, yet very cozy, quiet, very clean, & bright with lots of views of the water from the many windows - which also make for nice cross breezes. The place is very thoughtfully stocked (great sheets & towels), including condiments in the fridge, cookware, coffee and tea. There is plenty of firewood, grill supplies, beach/sand buckets. Our dog enjoyed the fenced yard and the extra toys & treats that were provided. Beach access is adjacent to the driveway - watch that mud though - I almost lost a boot! Ocean beaches, restaurants and 'downtown' Westport are about 10 minutes away. There are games and puzzles, local magazines and a few books. The TV/Wifi instructions were clear (as were all the other tips). The area has spotty coverage, FYI. We had everything we needed and loved this peaceful, pretty spot!"

My BF was able to capture a photo of an eagle perched on the furthest pile. Truly amazing. We witnessed a very intense wind/rain storm during our second night. WoW just wow! Mother Nature was in full effect and we loved it.
The covered porch/patio was pretty amazing as we could head out there and chill during the rainstorm as it is completely covered. And when it is not rain-storming you can hear the ocean waves crashing in the distance.
We are looking forward to booking our next stay and will book during spring/summer so we can take advantage of kayaking the Bay.
Thanks again Harwoods for your generosity! We will be back and have sent your Airbnb information to my sister and one of our best friends."

The outside area was amazing and offered a lot of variety--you could hang out in the covered patio, eat at the picnic table, sit by a fire, play fetch in the grassy area, or enjoy an unobstructed view of the water in the hammock or adirondack chairs!

Stayed with a pet","Laura's cabin is truly a special retreat. This is my second time here with my dog, and so far is the only repeat Airbnb that I've come back to. That alone should tell you how great this little cabin is!
The view is spectacular. The fully fenced in yard is spacious and lush with so much room to run around with my dog. Laura provides all the amenities for you to bring along your dog, plus extras such as bowls, baggies, towels and covers, treats and toys. My dog is so happy at this spot!
For us humans, we were so delighted with our stay. The cabin is cozy and situated right on the estuary, where you can see birds and wildlife go by, the tide come in and out, and the sun shine across the landscape. We cooked a couple meals in the kitchen and everything we needed was provided, such as oils, spices, every kind of cooking and bakeware, utensils, etc. You really only need to bring yourselves and your own food. The rest is provided for.
We will now make this a yearly trek to visit Laura's."

Stayed with a pet","This place is really lovely—
it was clean, well provisioned, comfortable and cozy- she had lots of toys and books, binoculars, DOG TOYS (!!)—
lots of little details that made it really nice- a fire pit as well as a smaller fire “bowl” that you could use and be comfy and dry! Such loving notes about dogs and dog care- so many poop bags!! Makes it really easy to be responsible—
I’m generally eager to be on the ocean when I can, and was worried I’d be bored without the “big water” to look at from my window- but this view was just beautiful- if you like birds (hint, I DO), you’ll love this place- the old dock pilings attract them all- kingfishers, cormorants, eagles, more species visited then I could count and identify!
And the sunsets!
This is just a really nice place, and well priced, private and cozy-"

The location is beautiful and quiet and very convenient to nearby towns. The house itself is cozy and comfortable with a great view. The house is warm and has everything you need. We had heavy rain the first night we were there so it was great to be able to pull the car under the carport. The weather didn't cooperate for sitting outside but the yard and patio looked really nice. Also appreciated the later check-out because it allowed us to go over to the beach and look for shorebirds in the morning. I would stay here again if I return to this area!

The cottage is truly dog and people friendly. It was nice seeing the Elk River area in the summer as last time we came it was spring. We do need to come back though as I still need to see the river otters everyone talks about!
And yes as others have said it is the little touches that make such a difference. The cottage is one of the best AirBnb's you could experience!
Of note, while in the area, if you enjoy wine, good food, gardens, mermaids and have dogs, you got to stop at the Westport Winery and Gardens. The Westport Winerly and Gardens is the perfect paring with the Bay City Waterfront Cottage!"

Stayed with a pet","Laura’s cabin is spectacular with an amazing view of the water. It’s the most dog friendly place I’ve stayed in, with a large, secured, fenced in yard that wraps around, extra towels and covers for muddy paws and furniture, and nice touches such as toys, bowls, and doggie bags. My pup, Phoenix had a blast here.
Aside from that, everything was absolutely perfect. All kitchen essentials plus extras were provided, more than enough linens and bath items. Even bath bombs! The skylight above the tub made baths at dusk so much more relaxing.
We ventured out to the beaches of Westport a few times and the drive is so quick and easy. I actually prefer staying slightly out of town so the cabin was the best location.
There is river access and we ventured down there one afternoon, but the wooden steps are precarious and the trail is quite overgrown. I’d recommend sticking to the state park beaches and trails, but the river access was still nice to let my dog run around for a bit.
Laura allowed us a late checkout, which felt luxurious. Overall, I highly highly recommend staying at this cabin! We hope to book again soon so my partner can join next time.
Thank you Laura!!"

Lots of places to walk, a nice yard with lots of running space, no carpet to get muddy, understanding owners, a covered area if it is raining but you can still be outside, and pet covers in case your dogs like being up on furniture. It is small but totally adequate, esp if you are not going to spend much time outside. Nice sized bathroom and counter space. Lots of storage. Has pretty much anything you could need in the kitchen plus things you might forget like ketchup, spices, etc. It is a queen bed, very soft but lots of extra blankets and pillows. The futon in the living room folds down and is a full/twin. Small three person dining table. Great views and super close to Westport but much more quiet. I recommend Aloha BBQ for their fish and chips and shrimp. Good fries also. The winery just before Bay City has a really nice food selection and the mermaid museum is a kick. Plus it has beautiful gardens. You can go down to the beach in Westport and watch the surfers. If you go to the Tokeland Inn you can have dinner or lunch and a piece of hummingbird cake."

Stayed a few nights","As a frequent traveler to Westport, I think I found my ""home""! First, this is truly dog friendly, and as one who travels with a constant dog companion, this is a big deal. The yard is just perfect for humans and canine companions a like. The views are absolutely stunning and at times I didn't even want to venture out to ""see the world"" as all I would want to enjoy was at the cottage.
Laura also has made sure anything and everything you would want or need was in the cottage. Who else includes soft hotel like towels, bath bombs, dog toys and treats, coffee, and more than I can mention here.
The yard has it's own beauty beyond the views of the river. There are plants and little ""art pieces"" to enjoy throughout. And even though I lucked out as it did not rain while I was there, there is also a nice semi-enclosed patio that can be used during those wet or stormy days. If you love the outdoors, this is a perfect place to stay.
Lastly, the big words here are peace and quiet. The cottage is tucked away off the main highway and the small neighborhood is quiet. Yet, it is only a few minutes to Westport so you can enjoy the waves of the Pacific Ocean, the sound of sea lions, and the eclectic cuisine of the Westport marina. And you can always come back for more peace and quiet and feel right at ""home""!"

Perfect example is I had forgotten to pack my toothbrush and didn’t discover this of course until it was bed time. I was SO happy to discover that there was an unused toothbrush in the drawer.

Stayed over a week","I needed a place in Washington for a couple of weeks before my next location. I really didn't know anything about the Westport/Aberdeen area, but the description of the house and glowing reviews caught my eye, and I'm so glad I stayed. You know how cooks wink and say the secret ingredient in their dish is love, well that's what I would say makes this such special place. The hosts love this place and their joy in sharing it comes through everywhere you look. The weather was stormy most of the time and the area felt a bit sleepy during the pandemic surge, but this cozy little cottage with the big yard and view was like an oasis of comfort and care. The hosts are super responsive and even called to check on me during a particularly active day during the storm. I'm a digital nomad and the wifi was fast and reliable throughout. The notes and small touches like a dog toy, coffee, candles, a blanket flung over an outdoor love seat, everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom, and so much more make you feel like a VIP hotel guest in this sweet little cabin. I am living in Airbnb's for a year and can say that this place truly stands out. My little dog and I had the perfect 2-week stay and would come back again in a heartbeat. Oh.... and I can't forget to call out the view. Bald eagles soaring in front of the window and watching the tide go in and out were amazing on both cloudy and sunny days."

I was impressed by the thoughtfulness put into making sure that you have easy access to stuff you may need: matches by the candles, material to make a fire in the wood stove and the a stocked kitchen with tea, coffee, hot chocolate.
I stayed during a freeze and the place was toasty and cozy. The shower was hot. The wood stove made it cheery.

Stayed about a week","If what you want is peace and quiet and not alot of excitement this is your place. Perfect size for couple or small family. Good sized bedroom with good sized bathroom with tub and shower. Skylight above tub is great during the day but kind of dark at night making the shower dark. Decent counter space. Has hairdryer, shampoo and soap along with lots of bathroom items like bathbombs, cottonballs, lotions, etc. Queen bed fairly comfortable. Tons of blankets and pillows. Two windows in bathroom and two more in bedroom. Water pressure was ok, good temp, tall showerhead that detaches. Two side tables on each side of bed. Softest towels we have ever used. Living area has chair and futon that folds down to a full bed. Fairly comfortable. Smaller tv that has Peacock. Small three person table. Lots of extras like games, paint set, books, etc. Two windows in that area with water views. Kitchen is a full one with a small stackable washer and dryer. Has pretty much everything you could need including spices, odds and ends, small appliances including microwave and blender. Window there looking out on yard. Door has window in it and a screen door. Three stairs up to door from outside. Yard is completely fenced. Poop bags supplied. Lots of flower pots. Enclosed patio with three chairs and small table. Small bbq, croquet set, beach toys, hula hoops, jump rope, dog bowls and toys, fire pit, lots of wood. Wood stove inside. Carport covered with parking outside it also. Lots of chairs outside, hammock, room to play and run, picnic table. Great view although you can't see it sitting down due to bushes. View is 180 degrees and looks over estuary and bridge to Westport. You have neighbors but they are pretty quiet and only the rental next door can see into the yard. There is a trail down to the ""beach."" Not a beach to hang out on, kind of yucky but walkable. The trail down is narrow and the stairs are alittle scary. Wear bug spray, esp in late afternoon or u will get eaten. The first thing I thought walking into the home was ""wow, this place is really clean."" You are 10 mins from Westport. The surfers hang out on the end with the jetty. Lots of fresh seafood. My husband tried the beer at the local brewery which he said was terrible but they had a good pretzel and decent pizza. Not alot to do if you want a nightlife but lots of beach to walk, a really nice boardwalk along water and cool pelicans. The Tokeland Hotel is about 25 mins away and is the oldest hotel in the US. Good hummingbird cake. Pretty place that I think would be romantic. The cranberry museum in Grayland is nice. The Blue Bouy in Westport has a very good breakfast. One grocery store in town. One drugstore. Great place for dogs. We has three with two big. They provided covers for the futon and bed."

The cozy cabin is perfect for a couple or small family, and the fenced yard is great for dogs. The kitchen is stocked with just about anything you might need--we bought fresh cod from Brady's Oysters right down the road and cooked fish tacos one night. It's the perfect place for a wonderful vacation on the Washington coast!"

This building is full of history I’m sure. It does however need some repairs and could use new furniture in our suite. On couch only had two legs. We stay in Airbnb for the convenience of having all amenities However this unit needs some upgrades and new dishes for sure. (We couldn’t even find a pen, so not much for basic amenities )Three plates, two bowls,two cups, and 5 glasses. Few pots and pans are all you get In this kitchen. No serving platers or bowls. Eating out of the pots kind of made us feel like teenagers once again. No dish cloths are provided either just sponges. Broken bedroom door made it difficult to open and close. We made the best of it but we encourage the owners to take some time and go through each suite to ensure guests have everything for short and long term stays."

Stayed over a week","Stayed here during a work contract. Pros to staying here: you have privacy, w/d, allows pets, has a car port. Cons: construction going on next door so if you're a night shifter you probably won't get much rest, 2 flights of stairs, Aberdeen doesn't have much to do.
Overall, I never felt unsafe here. Christy was a great host and even took care of my cats while I was away. If you're a travel nurse I recommend this during your stay at HRH."

Stayed a few nights",Aberdeen is not a place I would ordinary. Stay but we were backpacking in the Olympic Rain forest. Quinault. There r no Airbnb’s in that area. I spent little time there. However it was an easy drive for me. The place was not the top of the line in Airbnb’s but I felt welcomed there and safe. Melissa who helped made me comfortable.

Stayed over a week","I arrived a day late traveled from NY sate. Washer&Dryer broken, no heat, dirty/dirty dishes, smelled like cats pee. “Christy” was informed of everything and fixed the heat gave us plug in heater that day. Replaced washer/dryer. Told her everything I found unsatisfactory. She was helpful &understanding. I left a couple of days early. I did not feel safe alone. The apartment door itself is glass. Another renter arrived and made me feel uncomfortable. I was asked how to get my dog not to bark but on my days off I could hear other dogs barking. Mind you I have a 3 pound puppy did bark at loud noises. Apartment houses on each side were run down and scary. The town it’s self is littered with homeless and drug addicts just a couple blocks away. I was warned by co workers not to leave ANYTHING in car as it will be broken into. Also warned not to stay near town. So I left a couple of days before my check out. I paid for my stay in advance. No refunds."

It's pretty spacious with a full living room, and a separate bedroom. The unit is dated and was not clean. I found some stains in the bathroom, and the kitchen was dirty too. I wiped all surfaces myself. It served its purpose for two of us."

Stayed with a pet","Fantastic host, and a great airbnb. The washer and dryer in the unit is an unbelievably convenient touch. Very pet friendly, there's a nice area for dogs just at the base of the stairs, and the furnishings are very well suited to people with pets. Host is also incredibly responsive to messages.
The only thing I'd mention that I haven't seen in other reviews is that the airbnb is accessed by a shared interior stairwell with two other units. It's a pretty trivial thing, and there was never a noise issue or anything that wasn't normal for a triplex. However being a pet friendly listing, we had our two dogs with us, and neither had lived in a building with a shared front door & interior stairwell. This led to a bit of alert barking the first night as we were going to bed because the dogs keep hearing people inside just on the other side of the door. If you have dogs like this, I'd just plan to bring a distraction for them that first night. It was a good training experience for them in a new environment on the whole."

Be aware that chemical air fresheners have been used excessively in the space and the residue is pervasive. To Casey's credit, she tried removing the glade products prior to my arrival (one in the kitchen was overlooked), but for me that was too little too late.
If you are sensitive, you might consider staying elsewhere."

Stayed with a pet","Casey’s place had all you need for a short stay in Aberdeen. Location was great bc you could walk downtown and there is a huge field across the street for exercising your dog. Neighborhood was cute. Bedroom was nice and the heating worked well throughout the apartment. This is not really a negative but be prepared to to walk up many stairs to get to the apartment. However, since I was traveling alone. If you have two people carrying your bags, it would be easy. My only problem was there was a pretty strong scent diffuser and I sometimes have sensitivity to certain scents. If you have a similar prob, you might simply ask Casey to unplug it before your visit and the problem is easily solved.
I don’t agree with another review that you can’t cook a full meal in the kitchen. The kitchen is small, but you can easily make it work. There is a good oven, fridge and microwave.
My only negative is I think the price is a little high compared to what I have gotten in other areas in Washington. Some of the lamps and furniture have tears, couch seat cushions don’t match material if rest if couch. These small type of things would not bother me if the place were priced a little lower.
That said, the apartment was fun. It had old-style carpet that I loved. I was in Aberdeen to visit Kurt Cobain haunts and I felt like I had stepped into the ‘90s. It was a neat building with very few apartments, again old-style with lots of character. Nice bathroom. Very clean too.
Casey was easily reachable and went above what I would have expected in providing me with info about seeing Kurt Cobain haunts which is why I was in Aberdeen. She was friendly and available and responded right away. Parking was very easy."

Just something to keep in mind. Was a good jumping off point for our visits to the rainforests and beach."
