Great place to stay, located close to Main Street, plenty of parking and room to move around inside the AirBnB. Well stocked with towels, dishes, etc. Priced right for the accommodations. The shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure.
Bring a beside clock if you want to know the time in the middle of the night. We felt like we were in Vegas with no clocks anywhere.
Rick and Dana were very pleasant to work with and we would recommend a stay here!
We will be back!"

It does not have central heat and air but they provided space heaters for the bedroom and bathroom and there is a unit in the main room. We were very comfortable the whole time. Clean fridge and shower. (There is a BIG step getting in and out of the bath/shower which might be difficult for older folks or people with disabilities.) A washer and dryer are provided. Very quick and easy drive to the casino! We will definitely stay again next time we come back to go to the casino. Very responsive and friendly hosts.

The area is very peaceful and quiet which was lovely. This is a weird compliment, but the AC system was set perfectly. I did not need to adjust it at all and was quite comfortable throughout my stay, a minor miracle for someone who is always cold! The kitchen is great with a full size fridge and a wine fridge so you can separate party from business, if need be. Also: multiple coffee solutions! I look forward to staying here again in the future. The only downside: I never met the pugs! Maybe next time? Thank you so much for hosting, it was great!"

Gated community with beautiful homes and easy access. Only 10 minutes to the Casino were we attended a concert. From snacks and coffee to every amenity needed and excellent quality linens. Things like easy to use guest login for Netflix to a comfy blanket to watch TV with. I especially liked the frosted mug in the freezer and cold beer in the refrigerator on arrival! Mona! Well done!

We could adjust the temperature; however, it would be stifling hot in some of the bedrooms, but very cool in other areas. The second issue was out of their control. We were very close to train tracks that seem to have a train pass every few hours, even during the middle of the night. It seemed to rattle the entire house, and the train whistle was very loud. Despite the train and heater issue, we would stay there again."

We didn’t even mind the trains. The house is very close to the Choctaw casino which was the main reason we chose this house (very easy to get there). My only suggestion would be to have a few more ear plugs (there was only 1 pair) for guests who don’t want to hear the trains at while trying to sleep. Also, we didn’t have any dish detergent pods. Other than that, the house is lovely!"

Stayed with kids","Communication was exceptional. Two minor issues with water and trash pick-up were taken care of with an hours' time.
The only thing the listing stated about the active train was that the railroad track was located near the house. Actually, the tracks are actually about 30 yards in front of the house. The train goes by twice every two hours, 24-hours a day. And it almost always pulled more than 100 cars. The entrance to the property has a private railroad crossing with no warning lights or retractable barrier so the conductor blasts the train horn before approaching the crossing. My guests and I never got used to the train horn."

Stayed a few nights","The house was just as beautiful and clean as it shows in the listing. The casino was right down the street which was very nice. Kaine was very communicative with us. The train is very close to the house, but we thought it was fun and different. It wasn't a bother at all. The only criticism I would say is the front door was not working well and my husband had to walk up the deck stairs and unlock the back door and then let us in the front door. He then let us out the front door and locked it behind us and had to go out the back door again and meet us at the car. Kaine did offer to fix it during our stay which was very kind. Just know that that back entrance has multiple stairs and the front entrance has a huge step up so it was very hard for my 76 year old dad to get in and out of the front door because he uses a walker and is a fall risk. Besides that, the place is just fabulous!"

There are two huge walk in showers. House was sparkling clean inside. Has everything you would need. We used the backdoor since it was closer to where you can park. Don’t forget to lock the door on your way out!

Group trip","I originally booked for a lower price for NYE. I had to do some updates to my Airbnb account and it cancelled my reservation. When I tried to rebook, the rate was increased due to it being a holiday. Totally understandable! When I emailed the owner they thought I cancelled so they updated their price. However, when they realized the cancellation was a mistake they offered to let us have it for the previous price. They totally didn't have to do that, but were very gracious. The house and property is beautiful and has a privacy fence in front since it sits on a busy road. The rooms were nice. The decor was very welcoming. The only reason it's not 5 star (4.7 is more like it) is because it sits right across the train track and multiple trains happened to go by that night, horns blowing due to being at the crossing. The only other issue was the heat was not on at all so it was very cold inside and took a bit to warm up due to the size of the house. My friends and I would totally stay again. We didn't get to make use of huge deck and fire pit, but definitely would have we'd time. The casino was literally a minute drive away. I totally recommend this beautiful home.... and they did have ear plugs! Lol"

The amenities are quite nice - you have access to a washer and dryer - and the kitchen is well stocked. You will hear the train...the tracks are right there...but we found it wasn't bothersome. We weren't here long enough to take advantage of all this house has to offer, but there is a nice large deck with a grill on the back of the house. You also have great parking space. We had a bigger group and there was plenty of room to spread out, plus adequate bathroom options. Again, you cannot go wrong with this Airbnb!"

Group trip","The place was spic and span when we arrived and it smelled clean. Its very close to the casino if you want outta the house but there is plenty to do on the property if you want to stay in. I love that there was a large assortment of pool floaties, and the horseshoe pit and cornhole was a fun feature also. The pool is on the smaller side and about 3 and a half feet deep, which would be great if you have young children. We were a party of six ladies and it suited us just fine as many of us girls didn’t want to get our hair wet anyway. There is a lovely field of sunflowers along the back side of the yard that make a great photo op. It’s also a nice piece of property and you can enjoy yourselves without having to worry about being to noisy for neighbors, we packed our sound bar and we’re completely comfortable blasting our tunes for an outdoor BBQ. We walked the property a bit to check out the full moon and it was lovely. Great place to stay!"

The kitchen and bathrooms had all sorts of necessities at our disposal. The bed was a little hard for my liking, but comfortable enough that I didn’t leave aching.
I would definitely recommend staying here if your looking for a country retreat where you just want to relax!"

Group trip","The house and property was perfect for a mother's day weekend. My husband and i spent weekend with our teenaged and college children. The house was spacious with new and plentiful cooking items. We enjoyed a game of corn hole and giant sized connect four on the back porch. My daughter swam in the pool, which was very clean. Saturday we fished in the pond and caught/released some small crappie. You can see the top of the new Choctaw resort tower from the yard (if close proximity to the casino is important to you) but we never left the property, as we were seeking something a little more low key. Highly recommend the place for all family types and can't wait to add it to our list of travel options."

Charles's home was our first AirBnB experience and couldn't have been better. He was quick to communicate check in instructions and when I had trouble with the door (my rookie mistake!) he was quick to call me back and walk me through. The house is beautifully furnished and cozy and the master bed is so comfortable. He thoughtfully left snacks waiting for us when we arrived. The neighborhood is very quiet and easy access to the highway, whether you're going to Oklahoma or Texas.

It’s a perfect place to unplug and enjoy down time. Super close to Choctaw. There is a dirt drive for about a mile. Be aware of that. We loved our weekend away!! We will be back.

Stayed with a pet","The farm is gorgeous. It has chickens, a very friendly horse and a couple of farm dogs. A great place to bring the family. Be careful if you travel with dogs. Erika and James allow your dogs to run and play all day and have tremendous patience. My husky/shiba-inu mix did not do well. She barked at the horse and tried to get into the chicken coop. We left earlier than I would have liked because I could not get her to stop going after the chickens. I was just too worried that she would, somehow, get one of them. So….beautiful place with fresh eggs. It can be a bit overwhelming for a dog that is not experience with farm life."

Walking in to farm fresh eggs and an immaculately clean home was so relaxing. There was all sorts of toys for the kids to play with and swings and a bed for the baby so we didn't even need to unpack those. My husband and I sat on the patio after the kids went to bed and enjoyed the beautiful Oklahoma sky in the peace and quiet with Sally and Ranger. We will definitely be making this part of our yearly trip!

Stayed one night","This awesome Airbnb is just like the pictures ……beautiful, peaceful. & affordable! From the minute I booked the host sent detailed easy instructions. The place was easy to find and prefect…. James was right there to greet us as we arrived. The welcome sign plus farm fresh eggs were an extra touch that made us feel like we were staying with fiends! We will definitely be staying here again and will highly recommend to others…… thanks James! 😊"

Stayed with kids","We arrived around 6pm the day of check in. We were immediately greeted by Ranger (who is an absolutely amazing animal); he and my 6yr old bonded immediately. The next morning my Grandmother and I were greeted by James and Ranger and shown the way to the pond for some early morning fishing. By the end of our stay, we'd met the entire family and all agreed that this was the most welcoming experience we'd had with an Air B&B. The fresh eggs were a bonus and you are also free to purchase more if interested. The best way I can describe this visit was ""Serene and Relaxing"". Thank you for entertaining our whole family and welcoming us onto your property. We look forward to visiting in the future."

The beds are comfy and kitchen is so thoughtfully stocked and equipped. This is Farmhouse- luxury and probably the most rested we have ever been waking up in an AirBnB. We stayed at 5-8 mph on the dirt road to be considerate and keep the dust down. Every detail was just as described, and the chicken coop is just outside the kitchen window if more eggs are desired! mahalo iā ʻoe my friends thank you for sharing your gorgeous Ohana with us!"

Their roaming pup is a sweetheart and the garage gym next door is an awesome touch. Right when you walk in, you’re hit with a wonderful aroma and a pleasant and cozy feel. We will definitely be staying here again - in fact, we’ll make trips to purposefully stay here. Our hosts, James and Erika, were gracious and friendly, as well, and came to welcome us. It’s a beautiful piece of land and so calming yet close to everything you might need! Thank you, again, for hosting our weekend getaway 💗"

Check-In and Check-Out was extremely easy with minimal (if any at all) contact needed. The dirt road to get to the property was in good condition so that was also not a concern for our small car, as thoughtfully listed by the hosts in their description. If you’re going to Choctaw it’s less than 10 minutes away, but unbothered by traffic, lights, noise etc."

Stayed with kids","Our family of five stayed at James's farmhouse for a weekend. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and comfortable. The space was beautifully decorated, perfectly clean, and well equipped. We especially appreciated these special touches: farm fresh eggs, k-cup espresso machine, sounder/night lights in each bedroom, comfortable and spacious beds (one king sized bed, one queen and a handy pack-in-play for our little one), heavy curtains conducive to a good night's rest, and a luxurious shower. Our kids enjoyed getting outside to run and play, visit the chickens (next to the farmhouse), and hanging out at the little playground and trampoline by the pond (which was within walking distance from the farmhouse). If you enjoy dogs, you will love their friendly dog Ranger who will be eager to greet you as you spend time outside. There were multiple hiking options within 30 minutes to an hour away. We chose to spend an afternoon in Denison at Waterloo Lake Regional Park; it was great for our kids (all under age 5). James and his family were outstanding hosts. Five stars!"

A few things I noted:
-The mattresses are very soft!
-The bottom bunk is hard to get into/out of due to the low height. It’s more for a child but I slept there just fine!
-Ice trays are provided, no ice maker or dishwasher.
-It was walking distance to great restaurants and shopping on Main.
-10-15 minute driver to Choctaw!
Thank you Tasha for all of your help and recommendations!"

I especially loved the closed in back porch. It’s a great, quiet place to sit and enjoy your morning coffee. But what really made our stay spectacular was the host, Tasha. If I could give her more than 5 stars, I would! My daughter has Down syndrome and is on a special needs cheer squad. We were in town for a cheer competition. Tasha really went above and beyond to make our stay special for my daughter and her friend. We will definitely be staying again next year!"

Stayed a few nights","Tasha communicates very well and is super friendly in conversation. The instructions are very clear for the maintenance portion of the house. The interior of the house is very cozy and welcoming and it has a fairly well-stocked kitchen. However, the floors needed a good mopping and the master bath needs a good cleaning (baseboards included). The back porch needs a good refresh - w/ a little finesse, it would be a nice place to have coffee/cocktails. The yard needs some finessing as well, it wasn't very inviting and we're outdoor people, so we like to sit outside for coffee/cocktails. We appreciated having a T.V. in the bedroom; however, we found the mattress to be very uncomfortable, and the bedding definitely needs a refresh. All in all, the stay was OK but w/ some work, it could be so much better!"

Stayed a few nights","In the late 1960's and early 1970's my husband and I bought this house...it was our first home in Durant. We were excited to see it had become an airb&b and we'd decided we wanted to spend our 58th wedding anniversary in our old home. My husband died just a couple of months before we could accomplish this, so along with my friends, we decided to have a ""Memories"" party in the Little Pink Cottage...it was amazing! All changes are for the best...all memories are left in tact...and others felt that as well. Many voiced desires to me to extend invitation to others to stay in the Little Pink Cottage. It still has a ""home"" quality and the most exciting thing for me was that it also has such a strong Christian influence everywhere you look...that has not changed either...only gotten better. Thank you for a great stay..my husband would have been thrilled with it as well."

The host was very kind and really responsive. She had great communication and her recommendations were really organized and helpful. The Ice House restaurant down the street is super close and a great place for dinner. Overall, if you're in the area and don't want to stay at the casino, this is a great option!"

The fenced in yard was great for my dog who could run untethered and chase the cardinal family when they landed on the ground (they were way too fast for her to catch.) I spent one evening on the front swing as the sun was setting and felt like a carefree child. Even the roadrunners introduced themselves (sort of) and the mosquitoes were extra friendly (lol). I have no complaints and only wish it was a little closer the my home in Maryland.

Stayed a few nights","The home was very inviting and a comfortable stay. The neighborhood is a great neighborhood, felt very safe as we walked of the evenings. The home was filled with excellent instructions on everything and had a great list of restaurants that we used. The only thing was trying to park in the garage. I fully understand about leaving a remote and losing them, but it rained during the mid part of the day most of our stay. We had to get out and walk in the rain to the front door so we could go in and raise the garage so we could park out of the weather."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I chose this house for a combination personal and professional trip. The house was perfect in every way for all of our needs and wants. It has an unbelievably useful office area wherein we could connect with the printer and print! The house was beautiful and clean. Very peaceful and lovely backyard with a nice back porch to sit and enjoy. The master bed was very comfortable. This is important to us because both my husband and I have some back issues. The kitchen has everything you could want. We ended up thinking we would need the house for an extra day because it appeared the business end of our trip might take until the very end of the time we had booked. Our hosts were extremely helpful in helping us get that extra day arranged. Lastly, we left some things upon departure and our hosts were again extremely helpful in getting them. Excellent stay, excellent service, excellent communication, beautiful house! Staying in Durant? Stay here! You will be glad you did!"

They have lots of information posted in the house about things in the house and also about the area. We enjoyed our stay and would be happy to stay again!"

I didn’t read that they had a wifi printer but let me tell you, they did and it came in handy. The home is in a very nice neighborhood and not far from downtown Durant. A few miles from the shopping area, a few miles from the lake and a few miles from the Choctaw casino. If possible, I would definitely stay here again."

The other little thoughtful touches were wonderful as well. The only suggestion noted would be a tv in the other 2 bedrooms. Other than that your home was amazing. We will definitely rent it again in the future.

Plenty of room for our group of 3, and much better than staying in a hotel room--would definitely stay again next time in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","Quaint and in a safe part of town which is important in Durant. I stayed to help my son move places as he is in the flight program at SE Oklahoma. There is everything you may need at this house, plus a fun ping pong table and games! Thank you as my college aged kid young adult and I had fun! Please note that there is not a stove- I didn’t cook but there isn’t one available but there is a countertop appliance to cook."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed two nights at the Hidden Oaks cabin while visiting family. The cabin is very cute and comfortable. The linens were soft, and the kitchen was well stocked. It’s in a lovely little glen of trees. It was too warm to make much use of the outdoor area, but it was a wonderful space and especially beautiful at night with the string lights. We will be back next time we come to Durant for a visit."
