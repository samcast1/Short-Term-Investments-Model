There was an easy to adjust thermostat that controlled the temperature well, a very clean bathroom and kitchen and a full-sized frig. This property made a busy trip much less stressful knowing we had such nice accomodations to relax in!"

Stayed a few nights","my fiance and I stayed here for the weekend, had an amazing time in the town of tiffin. there so much to do and it's all nearly within walking distance. highly recommend the area. well definitely be back. Our air b&b was very clean, cozy and all updated. I slept better than I have in years on the bed!! we had some complications getting into the house the first night(possibly double booked) but our host went above and beyond and put us in a hotel room for the night! the rest of our trip and the house exceeded our expectations. we will definitely rent again and be back to tiffin. thank you Josefina for being so accommodating."

Stayed a few nights",Amazing rental. We have staid in several and this one tops it off. Everything was clean and lots of stuff to do at the house. We didn’t have to worry about if we needed something or needing to bring extra supplies. It was there for us like a hotel. We did bring stuff just in case but we been to some that don’t have anything. We will for sure be staying here in future if it’s available. And the price was great. I didn’t feel like it was over priced and it felt about average in the area. We can’t wait to go back to visit family knowing this house is for rent. Thank you

Stayed a few nights","Lisa's place was an ideal location for what we needed to do. It was very comfortable, very clean and helped us to relax after a lot of travelling. We arrived later than expected after a long journey and it was a lovely touch from the host to leave us some much needed refreshments. There are local shops easily accessible. Having the key pad is great as we don't need to worry about keys!! I'm going to add one to our home!!
My only recommendation would be to have a washing machine - although there is a laundromat close by that we did use.
Thanks for a great stay and use of your excellent property."

Stayed a few nights","This home was spacious, clean, and comfy! A super cozy home from the couches to the bedrooms! The house was kept nice and cool for our mid-July arrival. The water pressure in the shower was phenomenal and refreshing. The covered & carpeted front porch provided a nice shady hang out spot. There are several stores within walking distance where you can pick up anything from forgotten beauty products and toiletries to snack foods and alcoholic beverages.
Lisa kept in touch our entire visit. She did inform us whenever someone was expected to be outside on her property (ex: trash removal day).
We highly recommend anyone visiting OH to consider a stay at this property- or any property associated with this awesome host!"

We absolutely loved the fact that we were right across the street from the stadium and did not have to worry about parking. The air bnb was exactly like the pictures showed, clean, cozy and the hosts were greatly . They were very detailed in the check-in process, responsive to my request to put a tent up for us to used while we hung out outside with family and friends. Tiffin is such a beautiful little town, and the staying at this air bnb made it that much better. When we come back to Tiffin in the future, we will definitely look into staying in this air bnb again if available."

We appreciated having a space to stay that was near where we needed to be, and offered a living room that comfortably allowed all four of us to visit and catch up. The apartment is just the right size, in a safe, convenient part of town with easy parking and access. It was great that there are no steps into the apartment and also has a walk-in shower for sister-in-law who had mobility issues.
Great space; highly recommend."

Her place is really just spectacular: modern yet cozy, clean with comfy beds and fluffy towels. With plenty of space to hang out and a full kitchen, you just really can't beat it. We had a great time visiting our daughter at Heidelberg to catch a theatre production she was in and having the space for our friends to stay a night was perfect. If you are visiting Tiffin this is THE spot to stay. Close to downtown with several spots to eat right around the corner it really is perfect."

Stayed a few nights","This was a nice apartment in and of itself. For under a couple of grand, it could have been really nice - and still could be with not that much effort or money but instead, read on. No dresser in either of the two bedrooms, no dish towels, no bathmat, no microwave, no dishwasher, no cutting board, no tables in the living room area so nowhere to set a drink, a book, a laptop, etc., only 2 coffee mugs. The oven was extremel dirty, cheap and dirty pie tins for drip pans under the stovetop burners, really dirty, ratty and worn kitchen rug (we put it away so as not to see it). Dirty and cheap dish drainer, multiple nails and holes in the walls. The shower head leaked bigtime and squirted all over the place. The diverter didn't work so you couldn't take a bath or adjust the shower head. Lots of owner's random stuff in the kitchen drawers and two of the closets. The iron that was provided leaked. The TV was tiny and cheap furniture. No bedspread on the twin bed. One ratty blanket. Too bad"

I was very shocked that he did not have a microwave. The beds also had thin blankets in place of comforters. The kitchen supplies are very basic. I had borrow a cutting board and a few other basics from a family member in town.
This place could also benefit from a deep cleaning. Counters and floors were clean but window sills, under bed, ceiling corners, TV stand, shower ceiling all could use some attention. We also had a problem with finding ladybugs. I normally wouldn’t find this to be a huge deal but I found one in my butter that I set out to soften."

That alone was very much needed being we had drove 10 hrs & everyone was exhausted but hungry at 3 in the morning. I would definitely recommend this place for any Tiffin university families coming to visit. This will now be our home away from home in the fall for football!

It was incredibly clean. You can tell this host takes pride in providing a wonderful experience for their guests. Everything we needed was provided. The furnishings were obviously chosen specifically for practicality and function but looked beautiful in the space. Dishes and appliances were great quality...not the cheap things you usually would find in a rental home. Beds were comfortable with luxury bedding.

We walked in to a binder of all the local things, house rules and recommendations in the area. She provided us all with Balreichs potato chips, chocolates, small snacks on the counter and a note welcoming us to the house. It looked like a model home. Everything was so clean and tidy. She provided extra things such as a tooth brush etc if we left them at home and a fully stocked kitchen with the basic utensils to be able to cook at the house as well. The house was decorated gorgeous and felt like I was staying at a family members home. The back patio was so quiet and relaxing and was a nice place to hang out while we were waiting to meet with family. The bedrooms were fully furnished and the beds were so comfortable. When rough weather moved thru Tiffin she messaged us to make sure we were safe as well! The best experience ever! Thank you so much Becky!"

It is quiet and peaceful with a lot of added touches. Very nice soft fluffy towels.
It is in a area of town called “Frostville” which is being slowly but lovingly restored by a local businessman. Great to see this part of town spring to life."

Charm mixed with old and new! The bathroom is huge and we loved the decor throughout. Parking was very convenient and we enjoyed sitting on the porch in the evening. We enjoyed breakfast at the Frost Café and walking through the war memorial located across the street and the beautiful park by the river; being so close, we really liked being able to just walk to these places. I talked with Kari several times leading up to and including during our stay and I felt like I was talking with a friend! Thank you for your hospitality and we look forward to our return!"

It is literally within one block of several parks and historical sites. There is the Frost Deli about one block away which we found outstanding.
The venue is exactly as described, and that was fine. I would have preferred a slightly bigger bed, but all was good. Very convenient. Robert and Kari were very quick and responsive to all our questions."

Grocery nearby; we made dinner & kitchen has everything needed. Same in BR/bath. It was perfectly comfortable for six adults for the weekend.
Washington street lended plenty to walk for experiences. Fun and safe area. Private parking. Stephanie is wonderful; she was helpful and professional.
Our son attends Heidelberg University. Just perfect for us & I highly recommend for family or friends needing a place to stay in Tiffin- visiting or occasion!! FYI. adjacent units also owned by Stephanie. Would definitely stay again. And if you’re wondering, her price is on point. Solid value."

The washer and dryer was a big plus but the Airbnb website said there was only a washer, that should be updated.

Fast forward four years to our daughter's recent graduation a few days ago--we were so lucky to be able to book with Robert and Kari one last time. We leave Tiffin with wonderful memories and a heart full of gratitude to Robert and Kari for expanding our Tiffin ""neighborhood"" beyond the campus boundaries."

Stayed one night","Perfect overnight! I came to town with my son to tour the university and staying at Robert and Kari's was perfect. They made finding the place super easy, communicated better than most hosts and provided one of the best selections of amenities and comforts that I've seen. The hosts are very friendly and gave a lot of helpful information once we arrived. After more than 8 hours in the car that was really appreciated! We played cards and relaxed on the comfortable couch. The two bedrooms were comfortable and private. We drove a few short minutes to a delicious local restaurant (MST) for dinner and had great coffee the next morning (Bailiwicks). Highly recommend and I would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This rental has become a second home for us, and its owners have really become like family. When we first rented from Kari and Robert, our youngest daughter was a freshman at Heidelberg University. Every year, we help move her into, and out of, her campus living accommodations. Kari and Robert's unit is literally just around the corner from the university, which makes frequent trips to campus a breeze. Our daughter is now entering her senior year, and I was extremely fortunate that Kari and Robert's unit was available to rent for this year's final move-in experience. SInce my initial stay, this rental has become a well-deserved, extremely popular Airbnb in the Tiffin area.
Kari and Robert are great hosts--they quickly respond to inquiries and their unit is spotless and full of thoughtful touches. They are also funny, kind and considerate. I always feel I'm valued as a person, not just a renter, when I visit. Stay once and I guarantee you'll leave feeling the same way!"

Our group of 5 spent 3 nights at the apartment for our Cedar Point trip and it felt like home. Very clean and tidy, organized, and welcoming! We had no issues with the space and felt confident that if any had arisen, our hosts would have resolved it promptly. Although there are people living below this space, we never heard anything and the neighborhood was very quiet at night. The drive to Cedar Point was a little long, but the roads are open and it was an easy drive. This space is a great option and we hope to stay again in the future!"

The apartment had a very pleasant, gentle and not overbearing, odor - I looked forward to that every time I came in. More than enough of anything you could want was there, from toiletries, to kitchen items, to books and games. I would love to stay here again when I come to town. Thanks for such a pleasant stay!"

We are avid hikers and were so pleased that we were able to walk into downtown, to the river that runs through town, to restaurants and through neighborhoods with beautiful historically old homes. We enjoyed hiking at a nearby nature preserve. We will happily stay there again as soon as the opportunity arrives! Only problem, I didn't have time to read some interesting looking books that were available!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Robert & Kari's Airbnb was basically my first experience with this venue, so wasn't completely sure what to expect. I certainly had nothing to worry about! My space was the entire second floor of the house with a private entrance. 2 bedrooms, a kitchen, a very large living room, and a bathroom. It was large, comfortable, and extremely clean!!!
Kari was delightful and helpful to talk with on the phone, but we never saw each other. The location of the house was perfect for me to drive back and forth to my 50th reunion at Heidelberg College -- basically an easy 3 minute drive thru quiet neighborhoods. It also was fairly close to St. Rt. 224, which made finding their house very easy.
All in all, I would recommend staying here. Thank you, Kari, for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","Robert and Kari were responsive and friendly. They live downstairs with their dog. We heard the dog when we checked in and never heard it again. We heard their child come home one night but them living downstairs, we worried more about making noise then we heard from them. The floors squeak so we were a bit paranoid since we kept different hours since we were attending a tournament at Tiffin University.
The house was an easy less than 2 mile walk to the university. The streets in Tiffin are safe. The community is quaint. Robert and Kari have an elementary school in their backyard so very peaceful on the weekend and plenty of extra parking in case you bring more than one car.
The house was very clean. They have cabinet of toiletries in case you forgot something. It seemed to be pretty encompassing. The kitchen had a few snacks and canned food and the refrigerator had water. We weren't there much but to enter and have a cold bottle of water was heavenly.
A firm bed and a memory foam"

The apartment is spacious, clean, comfortable, and in a convenient location to everything in town. Plus, there are also so many little things in the apartment (various kitchen and bathroom and hygiene items, etc.) that one would often not remember to bring with them. It's those little things that, in my opinion, make the difference between just a good airbnb, and an exceptional one. And, with the limited choice of quality hotels in Tiffin and corresponding high prices, Kari's apartment is very fairly priced as well. Thanks Kari!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Kari's Airbnb in Tiffin, Ohio. We were there for my 50th high school reunion. The location was perfect for us, centrally located around the various activities for the weekend. Kari and her husband gave perfect instructions for checking in, were quick to respond to texts, and took care of the needs we had. The only downfall is that you have to go up a flight of stairs. That was ok for us, but might not work for very elderly or physically challenged folks. But we knew that there would be stairs, so it was no surprise. This was our first experience at an Airbnb, and it was entirely positive!"

Very light sleepers may have a problem sleeping due to a bit of noise, but I think the levels would be fine even for most light sleepers. Other than those nit picky things the place worked out wonderfully for my needs!"

We had no trouble but if you have mobility issues it could tricky. Place is in a cool unique setting but it’s an older building with outdated but clean and functional kitchen and bathroom. It worked perfectly for our short weekend trip.

The apartment takes one back to unique & simpler times & also has modern touches. Like I mentioned, we didn't give our host much time to prepare for us (literally less than 2 hours from the time we requested the room). We were shocked they even responded so quickly! No issues at all! We would stay again without hesitation! The surroundings were quiet and the location was perfect to visit our son at the University. We'd love to see how the view changes with the seasons!
Thank you so much!"

A little candy dish full of candy, chips, pop but our favorite the bread mix to make homemade bread in the bread machine!! Drew was very accommodating by letting us add an extra day to our stay!! Being on a dead end street made for very quiet and peaceful surroundings. Lots a space to spread out and relax!! If we are ever in the Tiffin area again this would be our first place to try to book but I have a feeling it might not be available too often because it’s that nice!! Drew was very responsive to texts and very helpful. We have been in many nice Airbnbs and this would definitely be one of our favorites!!! Thanks for a great weekend away!!!"

Heather was very accessible and responded right away to all requests. Our only area for improvement is the outside lighting.

Group trip","This is a vintage home with the charm of all that goes with an old home - old wiring, extremely creaky floors in the whole house (you can't take a step without everyone in the house hearing you.) only 2 electrical plugs in each bedroom, and dark rooms. Bring extension cords if you have multiple items to plug in. The two rooms off the kitchen and living room have a slightly lower floor that is easy to trip on, and would benefit from having colored tape or paint marking the difference in floor height. The kitchen has reasonable space and amenities, but be aware that the dishwasher has rusted racks that will leave rust on dishes. Heather was responsive on a couple matters that i needed to contact her about and the house is located in an older but safe and nicely cared for neighborhood."

Group trip",Great house with a nice yard in a great location in Tiffin. Our grandkids (5 & 2) had fun on the swing set and exploring around the big back yard. It was very comfortable for our family to hang out together while in Tiffin for a wedding. So much nicer than a hotel!

The house was simply decorated but with everything we needed. It was very clean and a welcoming environment."

We had plenty of supplies and for this crew of ten we certainly appreciated it. The house was perfect for our size gathering. We loved being able to be in the same room together. The kitchen was awesome and had everything we needed! We will absolutely stay here again as it’s a perfect meeting place between our families distance wise. We were definitely lucky to come across this listing. Thank you for all your help Amy. I appreciate everything you did for us :). Thank you for having us! We had a great time!

Loved the waffle weave blankets- several of my family went on line to buy them. Well stocked kitchen for cooking. There is a half bath and the master suite downstairs, two bedrooms and full bath, with bathtub upstairs. Parking in 2 car garage and double driveway was very easy. Don’t hesitate- rent it now!"

Stayed with kids",I booked this house for my family to stay while in town for family matters. House was immaculate and Amy was very responsive to our request. The house was perfect for my family of 7 and the little reading nook with books and game was perfect for my 7 year old granddaughter. Plenty of sitting areas and beds/bathrooms for us all to have our space. Driveway parking was a plus!
