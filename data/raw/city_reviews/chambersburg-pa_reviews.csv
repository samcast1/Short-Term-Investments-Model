Stayed a few nights",Jay was very gracious about our check out. We had a hiker need to go to the ER and were even later than the missed deadline for checking out. I cannot thank Jay enough for being understanding of my miscue and the even further our extenuating circumstances. Thank you again Jay.

It was wonderful to be able to make our own meals with the vast space and absolutely everything needed at hand's reach. We loved the privacy and easy access to our activities. The house is very comfortable, clean and feels like home, in a quiet neighborhood. The host kind and helpful. We would certainly book again. Thank you"

Being able to have a full kitchen to make some of our meals helped us with the cost of vacation & there was more than enough stocked. The home was very clean & comfortable. I’m always concerned with the mattress as I have back issues but no problem. We all slept very well. We were within a half hour of Gettysburg & had our privacy in the quiet, country setting. I would use Jay’s place again & highly recommend him to anyone!"

Stayed with kids","The flat was very clean, inviting, and had a ""felt like home"" vibe while we stayed 2 nights. Their instructions on how to get in and how to checkout were very understandable and sent in a timely manner. We had one little issue that they solved right away (ran out of TP lol) and were very helpful with all my questions up until and during our stay! As this being our first Airbnb experience, I'm glad we made the right choice going with them. Highly recommend them, and will definitely book again with them if needed. 😊"

Though you are right downtown, the apartment was amazingly quiet and parking was never a problem. Really appreciated the provided coffee (including sugar/sweetener and creamers). Plenty of outlets and lamps with USB ports, so that no one had to fight over charging devices and they were convenient to the beds. Would definitely stay here again on another trip to Chambersburg!"

Stayed with kids","A caveat, although the place and location are great.
The smoke detector went off while we were making toast with the broiler in the oven. (There is no toaster) There was very little smoke but it still set it off. No one we called knew how to turn it off! Finally our son figured out the box in the hall with some advice from the manager, but only because he has electrical experience was he able to turn it off.
Still, it was a great place and owners very prompt with replies. The farmers market on Saturdays is right outside back door."

One word of caution though to future guests using that room - there is an Exit sign that glows bright red, so anyone sleeping in that room had better bring a sleep mask (or enjoy the red glow)! But yes the place was pristine, would stay again."

The host was very helpful and was responding to my all my questions very quickly. Location is 10/10. The only problem I had was the sound of the central heater but I got used to it after some time. A lot of nice shops and restaurants around. Overall I had a very good experience and definitely recommend this place :)

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay in this cute walk-up. Hosts were responsive and apartment was easy to access. There is free parking behind the apartment, which you can access by walking out the back door of the apartment and walking down a somewhat unstable wooden fire escape steps. There is also meter parking in front. Place was clean, sunlit, and comfortable. I was a little surprised to find that there is not a separate bed in the bedroom with the bunk bed, as the drawings for Bedroom 2 indicate a single bed and there is no photo of the third bed in that room. It is in fact a trundle bed that then occupies all the floor space in the bedroom - not bad, just different than indicated. The apartment is located adjacent to several restaurants and coffee shops, making it a practical and charming location. All in all, a nice place with fair pricing. Would recommend!"

Stayed one night","I had to go to Chambersburg on a two-day business trip. I drove three hours to get there and went straight to work. I was on my feet all day in a hot, dirty, loud warehouse for my research.
It took me a bit to find Jay's place until I realized his directions were from the direction of Chambersburg. I had arrived from the opposite direction. His warning not to use the paved driveway, but the gravel one next door, was my clue.
Jay's place was an oasis of cool, comfortable peace where—after a luxurious shower—I was able to slow down and relax.
My only suggestion would be to post instructions on the wall of the galley kitchen on how to use the Kuerig for the few of us who have never owned one. It took me a few tries to get the proper sequence down. Having water bottles in the fridge was a nice touch.
I need to make another trip out to finish my research and I will definitely try to stay at Jay's!"

Stayed about a week","Stayed here for a week. Wonderful, peaceful location. Close to shops and restaurants but far from hustle bustle. My stay was comfortable.
It may be helpful to arrive well before the sunset because it may be hard to find the place. Request the host to provide the GPS coordinates which will bring you right up to the rental. Directions were good too.
Bugs are an issue as mentioned. Keep the doors closed all the time. A bug swatter may be necessary.
Kitchenette is small and does not have any utensils or stove top to cook meals. There is no washbasin in the kitchen. Microwave utensils were also only a few. Plan accordingly if you plan to cook. Microwave, Keurig, Toaster were there and worked fine.
Window AC is in the living room. When I visited, outside temperature maximum was around 85 F. The AC could cool the bedroom ok but not really cool. Not sure if the bedroom can be cooled when the temperature is very high.
Internet was fast and reliable. Gravel drive way parking was convenient."

Stayed one night","Jay had excellent communication, complete with pictures of how to find it. Despite that, it was hard for me, who is directionally impaired, to find it at night. There is absolutely nothing he could have done to make it more clear. He gave me pictures and even an overhead map. It had been a long day with a delayed flight. It was such a great thing to find I was staying in a nice secluded place with such a welcoming atmosphere and cozy bed. Everything was nice and clean. I highly recommend Jay's place."

Stayed a few nights","My siblings and I overall enjoyed our stay here. But we were disappointed that the place was not exactly as advertised in the pictures. The pictures advertise two couches, when we arrived, there was only one. We had planned to sleep on the two couches and bed. It was also disappointing that our flight was delayed and we were not able to stay at the Airbnb the first night, and the host showed no interest in even a partial refund. Other than that though, the place was clean and cozy. It was a lovely, inexpensive place to stay for a weekend trip. The host is very responsive and helpful with directions."

Stayed a few nights","Jay did a great job accommodating and working with me pre-booking and during my first 24 hours of stay. However, there were too many bugs that found their way into the home. Crickets and caterpillars mainly. Every time the door would open they would run in and even if none came through when getting in and out of the home they found a way in while I was away. There was a caterpillar on the roof and bathroom, crickets that came from the kitchenette area, and one in the drain of the shower. Constantly having to turn and kill bugs during my stay. When communicating with Jay his response didn't help resolve or seek to resolve the problem of whether he could control it or not. Wouldn't stay here again"

Stayed a few nights","I rented this place first is its good price and it is close to Gettysburg, also I wanted some fresh air in Pennsylvania's countryside. The location is just outside of Chambersburg and convenient to shopping and everything you may need. The house is clean as described as in Airbnb ad. Jay is super nice. I needed a small desk table so I can work with my laptop. Jay found one and immediately put it ouside of the house.
I went to Keystone Urgent Care nearby and did a COVID_19 test so my family members won't worry about my trip. The staff there are very nice and the test result cm two days later right before I was heading home.
I went to Gettysburg from this rental (about 45 minutes driving). As a fellow Pennsylvanian, I have never been in Gettysburg before where one of the most events in U.S. history happened. During this difficult time, my visit to Gettysburg taught me a lot. I hope our country is united and stands strong forever."

The town does tend to shut down a little early so plan accordingly. We were able to enjoy a later dinner at Bistro 71 (very short walk) without reservations we managed to sneak into a spot at the bar. We also had a visit to the GearHouse brewery which is nearby.
The cabin is about a 30 or 40 minute easy drive into Gettysburg if you want to hop over for some history or cute shops.
We were so very pleased with our choice and could not speak highly enough of the convenience of everything! Wonderful experience! Will definitely recommend it to others!"

Stayed a few nights","Creekside in Chambersburg was an oasis inside an urban setting. Downtown Chambersburg is is just short block away where you will find wonderful restaurants (Falafel Shack...homemade pita and hummus, terrific salads and don't forget Demin Coffee and Olympic Candy Kitchen). But if you even decide to never leave the Airbnb...you won't be disappointed!!! Right outside the front door you are welcomed with cascading waterfalls. The unit is two stories and you can step outside the bedroom onto the balcony/deck under a tree canopy to drink your morning coffee. Inside you will find everything you need for a night or longer get away. A fully equipped kitchen if you want to prepare your own meals, a cozy sitting area with a flat screen TV. Beautifully appointed antiques and artwork on the walls. Upstairs is the bedroom with comfortable bedding and crisp white linens. The bathroom has a luxurious marble shower. You will feel like you are in a five star resort!!! Looking forward to returning."

Stayed with kids","My wife and I have been going to Chambersburg 3-4 times a year since 2014 and we have never experienced it the way we did when staying at King Street. The first thing we noticed upon arrival was the sound of the Conococheague Creek which presented a calming presence. The home, itself, is nestled in history as it sits on the same land Fort Chambersburg once did prior to its burning. Plaques and monuments surrounded us engulfing us in the Civil War history that is rich in Chambersburg. The walking distance to a myriad of attractions forced us to explore a town we typically drive through and the local establishments, specifically Brussels Cafe, with their charm are very welcoming. The hosts we phenomenal and very communicative. I am glad to say we've have found our ""home away from home."""

There is a river outside of the place that sounds like a waterfall and plenty of outdoor seating at the place to enjoy the sound. The house was clean and fully stocked with any essentials that might be needed. The host was absolutely wonderful and we were greeted with a note and some macaroons. There was also a book of recommendations for things to do in the area which was extremely helpful. The area is super cute and has a nice small town feel. It was really nice having all the local coffee shops within walking distance as well. Everything just felt very homey and had a peaceful cabin feel to it right in the middle of town!

Their beautiful home is surrounded by nature but right in the middle of town. The upper deck had an amazing view of the creek and we loved being able to step outside to the sound of the water streaming over the rocks! A quick walk to great local shopping, restaurants, and cafes. Saturday morning the local farmers market was just outside of the property, which was a great surprise!
Creekside on King was more than just a place to stay - it was an incredible experience! The hosts haven’t overlooked a single detail. Our stay was full of little surprises and we can’t wait to stay again!
Overall, my best Airbnb experience ever!"

Stayed a few nights","We couldn't have been happier with our stay. It was the perfect peaceful hideaway to celebrate our 14th anniversary for a couple of nights (along with our 5 mo old twins!). A restful setting for being in town, with walking trails, small falls & a water wheel nearby. There's plenty of restaurants & cute shops close - our vehicle stayed parked the whole time as we walked everywhere we wanted to go!
We loved the rushing, falling stream flowing just feet from the front door, and eating out on the upstairs deck that overlooks the creek.
The house was beautiful, and so very clean (that means a lot to us - I'm a bit meticulous when it comes to cleaning, and most places we stay I notice some dirt..but not here! :)
We hadn't noticed from the listing that there's a spiral stairs to the bedroom. It wasn't an issue, but some may appreciate knowing that. The outside stairs made bringing our luggage in easy.
Thanks so much, Kevin & Sharon for creating this beautiful retreat, and sharing it with us!"

The beds are very comfortable and the multiple baths made it even more accessible as a host site. The attached spacious meeting room was exactly what we needed to spread out and work on our art projects.
The kitchen is well equipped and the thermostat kept at a very comfy temp. The house is clean and clutter-free and beautifully decorated.
Heidi is an amazing host. She is extremely proactive and communicative. As an example, we had trouble operating the dishwasher and messaged her. She instantly responded and asked if she could stop by after work to make sure everything was ok. After a quick pop in, everything was working perfectly.
We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","The Homestead House is located in a peaceful neighborhood, close to I-81 & Chambersburg. Heidi is an exceptional host- kind & responsive. The office is private & comfortable with excellent WiFi. There is plentiful hot water & good water pressure. We only used 3 of the 4 bedrooms. The downstairs bed & upstairs king beds were very comfortable. One queen bed upstairs was quite soft not as comfortable. This is an historic farmhouse with all the charm, character, & quirks that go with it – Helpful hints: Information about the house & area is posted on the side of the fridge; the downstairs toilet may need to be watched to be sure it flushes completely; the single bed listed is in the queen bedroom upstairs in the “pull out” chair. This is a huge house. It looked like the substitute house cleaner may have missed cleaning a few areas prior to our visit. Our family was grateful to be able to use Heidi’s Homestead House for a gathering place after my Father-in-law’s funeral. Thank you!"

Group trip","Heidi’s farmhouse is stunning! I used her home as a wedding weekend stay for my bridesmaids and I to get ready at on the morning of my wedding. The beautiful den and large gathering room made for beautiful photo-op areas. The location is peaceful and quiet, and an easy 10 min drive into Chambersburg. Heidi was super helpful and responded quickly to all of my questions! Definitely recommend staying here!"

Group trip","Our family of 9 had a wonderful stay at Heidi’s place while in the area for my sons wedding. We had plenty of space, everyone slept comfortably and it was a peaceful place to come home to each evening. The feature that clinched our original booking was the amazing dining room that has 4 king farm tables seating 8- 10 people each. Family meals together is important to me and this arrangement was even better than what I have at home. I will also add that in a last minute decision my husband and I wanted to host our out of town guests for breakfast on our last day. With Heidi’s permission we hosted around 24 people for a wonderful brunch with ample space. Each of our guests were “wowed” by the space and seating in the great room. I would without hesitation use this air bnb again because of the space as well as Heidi’s exceptional demeanor."

The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. The house smelled so good the second we walked in. It was so spacious and beautiful. We wish we could’ve stayed longer! Heidi was so helpful and accommodating with the time frame we needed the house for. Heidi also has great taste in furniture and decor. Trendy, rustic, boho farm vibes. We loved it!"

Group trip","Heidi responded quickly to any issues that developed. We received fair financial compensation (one free night) for issues including a furnace problem. The home is roomy and comfortable. There are issues to note when considering a stay. The kitchen had not been cleaned well (dust covering the knives and knife block, a coffee pot which had not been cleaned after last use, for example). None of the second-floor doors lock, including the bathroom. The listing states that there are five beds. In the “Where you’ll sleep” section, bedroom 4 lists a queen bed and a single bed. The photo shows this also. The single bed/mattress was nowhere to be found. One of our group members had canceled, otherwise, we would have needed that bed."

Stayed one night","Don’t hesitate this is a great place! I hosted my birthday party here with 15 people and it was a great place which my friends and I absolutely loved! We drove to the house around 9:00 pm and honestly at night the place place outside looks so creepy and we were all really scared because the house ate every spread apart. We used flashlights to see where to go in the front of the house and we were a little hesitant but as soon as we opened the door we were so glad. The place was clean and looked fancy and it looked very different from what we expected. The rooms are big, and my fav area was definitely the dining room that had 4 big tables that my fitness and I spent the most time at. It’s a really big area. Heidi was a really great host she responded fairly quickly and wanted to make sure we had a good time. I think the only down side of this place is the bedroom locks don’t work so you just have to close the door which was a little inconvenient for us and another thing is it o my has 2 bathroom so if you’re hosting large group of people you should take that into consideration. But overall my friends now praise me for getting this place we absolutely loved it and had a great time. Another bonus point for us was, we live in city area so in the morning the sunrise was absolutely gorgeous. We all had a chance to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air while enjoying to beautiful view. I would definitely book this air bnb again."

We appreciated very much that we were able to have enough hot water and pressure to have 2 people showering in the full bathrooms while running laundry, which is rare! The outside lighting is minimal and it was initially difficult for us to find the key box when we came in late. Outside of that, the beds were super comfortable with plenty of room for our large family, the towels plenty, everything we needed in the kitchen was supplied, and the setting was gorgeous!"

The party room and outside space was such a great feature as well, we had beautiful weather so we took advantage of the grill and the fire pit. Modern appliances and fixtures in a historic home along with comfy beds and convenient to both Chambersburg and Shippensburg - definitely recommend."

My 4 kids had a blast running circles in the house. The location was perfect for a short drive into chambersburg where you could find everything you need. Gettysburg was not far away either, and it was a perfect home base for our stay. The host was super friendly and very willing to help in anyway.

Cleanliness is disappointing. There was mouse poop all over the place, including the kitchen counters.
Supplies were very low.
We had to buy more tiolet paper.
There were laundry facilities with zero laundry soap.
There were not enough plates, bowls, and silverware.
Communication was adequate.
It would be helpful to have check in and check out procedures posted at the house.
After booking and going into poultry flu breakout, we were not notified of not receiving complimentary dozen eggs.
It would helpful to have a list of good to know. Example is that a box fan is available if needed.
Our experience was doable, but it didn't meet all expectations ."

This is not a terrible thing as we all brought something to share with each other in the morning. The downstairs toilet needs babysitting when flushing, I don't recommend going #2 in that toilet.

We had plenty of space to have our kids and their significant others over for dinner. Plus, we never felt crowded when we had a few moments of down time. There were separate niches to read, chat, or work. The house is well set up and the decorating is super cute! We’d highly recommend staying here!! Thank you Heidi! You were wonderful to work with!"

Stayed with kids","Very charming and spacious home, perfect for our family of 5. The house was well appointed, beds were comfortable, communication with host was excellent.
The large room with four tables was fun to eat in and got great morning light. The house was close to the road, but it’s a quiet road with only a few Amish passing by on their bikes.
Lots of nearby restaurant options and a great stopping point on our way down south. Would highly recommend and hope to have a chance to stay again."

A variety of fun hiking trails are nearby. We can't wait to come back. The responses were quick from Heidi when we needed help. Jason was very friendly when he came by and told us about the house and area. Highly recommend!!

Group trip","This was the perfect house for what we needed. You are in the middle of the country but only 10-15 from Chambersburg, the interstate and everything else. Heidi was an amazing host, so quick to communicate. When we asked about some extra tables, she was there in 15 minutes to fulfill the request. Talk about service!! The house was nice and cool, even on the hottest of days (I was actually glad I'd packed a sweatshirt!!). The rooms were well-sized and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were well-stocked. The extra room (the one with the tables) is perfect for hobby get togethers (quilting, scrapbooking, board games, etc). It definitely exceeded our expectations. So glad we booked it!!"

Group trip","Anyone looking for a place to stay in the Chambersburg area I can't say enough nice things about this beautiful home. We were in the area for our daughters wedding and had a diverse group stay together in this lovely home. We were all very comfortable and had more than enough space that we were not tripping over each other.
We hosted a small gathering of the bride and grooms friends after the wedding reception at Adams County Winery and they really enjoyed playing corn hole in the very spacious outdoor area at the home. I wish I would have known about it sooner because the great room was larger than the reception area and would have made a beautiful setting for the wedding.
We can't thank Heidi enough for having such a beautiful home for us to use for a few days."

Thank you for playing a role in the success of our bachelor party.

Stayed with kids","Very tastefully redone old farmhouse. Exceptionally clean with what appeared to be new bath towels which was an extra nice touch. The bathrooms included higher quality, herbal shampoo, conditioner, body washes, and a few other amenities that were an unexpected personal pleasantry. The beds were very comfortable and the house actually seemed to sleep more than advertised. All of the rooms were decorated thoughtfully including the extra seating areas. Air conditioning was freezing cold. Plenty of room in the kitchen and TONS of space in the large newly added bonus room. Ample parking, lots of yard for the children to run and play ball. Feels very country but only about 10 minutes from anything you might need.. Wonderful experience at a value price. Highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","Absolutely wonderful stay with stunning views!
This house had it all. It was spacious and we were able to spread out or gather together throughout our stay. The dining room with two long farm tables accommodated our big breakfasts as well as evening card games. We made sure to bring pancake mix to enjoy the local maple syrup and there is no shortage of mixing bowls, measuring cups, utensils, pots/pans for cooking. I used the office to book Gettysburg tour tickets with my laptop (super fast wifi) and maybe also to clean up my inbox during some downtime! The family room has two comfy couches and the kids used the smart tv to access their netflix. The main level has a spacious bedroom and full bath as well. The upper level has three bedrooms and another full bath; towels are plentiful and shampoo/conditioner/body wash is available, as is plant-derived hand cream, lotion, etc which I really appreciated. Extra blankets were placed in each room as well. The back patio has a grill and seating for four, although we found ourselves congregating on the front porch most days and nights. Kids loved catching lightning bugs each evening. Prior to our departure, we used the washer/dryer to lighten the burden of returning home and I am so thankful this home has that amenity and there were a few laundry pods as well which I was grateful for since I neglected to bring some with me! You are about four minutes from I-81 as well a McDonalds/gas station/dollar general, so easy to grab a few necessities or jaunt one exit up for suburban restaurants. I really enjoyed this renovated farmhouse and the peaceful weekend it afforded us with my parents."

The location is terrific-wonderful rural setting, but not far to stores and restaurants. Heidi was very helpful throughout the process of booking and all through the stay. VERY fast response times to questions. The home is very well outfitted with everything we needed for meal prep. Nice sized bedrooms and bathrooms. It was nice to have a main floor bedroom for folks who don’t do stairs well. The dining room has several tables and plenty of chairs. Our whole family (30 of us) could eat and visit very comfortably. Highly recommend this property!"

The REtreat is incredibly warm and welcoming. Kendra has an incredible gift for styling a smaller space in such a way that accentuates all the unique and wonderful attributes you may not realize exist. Situated right on Main St Chambersburg, there are several restaurants, cafes and other venues within walking distance. Upon reading reviews of Kendra’s REtreat, we opted to eat at Bistro 71 — and we, like others who stayed with Kendra, we’re impressed with the quality of food and hospitality of the staff. We would absolutely love to stay at Kendra’s REtreat again and recommend it to anyone looking for stress free, RElaxing escape from everyday life!! ☺️"

It was almost a model room. What a difference interior design makes. Literally every thing -- from mirror in the bathroom to kitchen sink, bed frame and bathroom floor, was well appointed.
The apartment is located at the prettiest corner of the town. Unfortunately, all shops and restaurants were closed during holiday weekend, but I went to Giant nearby and fixed a quick meal, which was perfectly fine. The kitchen is equipped with disposal. I'm impressed."

My only recommendation is that if you’re a sensitive sleeper, make sure to bring a sleeping mask and ear plugs or a device that plays white noise. Since the apartment is right on the main drag, light filters through the curtains all night and the sirens are quite loud when they are deployed."

The only down side was that being an old building and on a main street meant it could be a little loud (fire trucks at night, loud passers-by on the street outside, etc.) But otherwise lovely."

The whole place was comfortable and had everything we could desire. There was coffee, tea, creamer, and two of the most delicious pastries from a local bakery. Kendra is lovely and her shop downstairs is full of beautifully curated pieces (many of which are on display in the apartment). This place is such a surprise find in this area. It could easily be competitive in a major city. A great value!"

Apparently, this sign is just a suggestion and not a command since several cars park there overnight without an issue."

Stayed a few nights","Had a lovely stay at Kendra’s pad. Room #3 had a large comfortable bed, boho decor, lush plants, and lovely handmade macrame art touches. It’s super clean, chic, and convenient. Book it.
My opinion of the place in context to the area, however, is that Chambersburg Airbnbs can be a bit pricey given that travel/tourism demand there is so low. Only going about once a year, but would go back more often if costs went down—it’s such a great 1-2 day staycation for the DMV. The businesses have high quality crafts, locally sourced foods on their menus, great drinks, the borough has lots of history, and is a great place to stay for a hiking or star-gazing trip into the mountains. Maybe if more folks new that, Chambersburg wouldn’t suffer so many empty storefronts, but enjoy the kind of influx of weekenders that Waynesboro or Gettysburg gets. Bar 71 is still the only “fine dining” spot in the area and has great drinks. The owner either hasn’t or hardly changed the price of spirits for one of the most extensive bourbon/whiskey menus I’ve seen in a long time. They even still have micro-greens as garnishes, which most restaurants have completely 86’d to cut costs. Alex running the Belgian Cafe is a dope human being. The Falafel Shack is still one of the best eats in the town. Denim Coffee still does better coffee than most hipster places anywhere else, but not frufru coffee, just what you need in an espresso house. The chocolatiers at Olympia Candy Kitchen make amazing truffles. And may the Nerdvana Outpost forever last, that hilarious and genuine hidden gem for comics, collectibles and games. Wish more places were open during the week. Be aware that quite a few places only operate Friday to Sunday. Knowing all that, I am still glad Kendra is opening her place to Airbnb guests, and I hope she does well."

Stayed one night","The decor, inspired by Kendra's boutique downstairs is urban and chic,(not what you might expect in Chambersburg) yet still very inviting and comfortable. The host was especially accommodating of my last-minute needs and arrival and parking were as easy pie.
The location is ideal, if you are in town on business at the government center or to play in Chambersburg for one of its many delightful downtown events, the apartment is just up from the center square and off the noisy main truck thoroughfare, and surrounded by a bountiful bevy of culinary options and great mom & pop shops. (Recommend the Historic Texas Lunch for a good country breakfast and Bistro 71 for something a little classier for dinner.)
Do make sure that you visit the shop downstairs and learn more about Kandra's unique and inspiring designs."

The porch overlooking the stream was a highlight, a serene spot to unwind and immerse oneself in the ambient sounds of flowing water and whispering winds. Here, I found solace and a connection with nature that’s unrivalled.
Inside, the place was the epitome of cleanliness, every corner spotless and every detail meticulously attended to. The quietude was profound, with only the gentle hum of the stream penetrating the silence, making it a sanctuary for peace seekers.
I couldn’t have asked for a more rejuvenating experience and would highly recommend this haven to anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle and find solace in nature’s embrace."

The suite was beautifully appointed (wainscoting, stone, hardwood floors) & it was IMMACULATE!! The host (Robin) has thought of everything (from the beverage/breakfast/snack station to the camp chairs and mosquito repellant for the creekside deck) & we loved her informative/instructional notes (no guessing how to use the different locks, etc)!
I/we will 1000% stay there again when enroute through PA!!!! Robin's creekside retreat would also be a great for a local just looking for a night of R&R!!

There are also tons of games, puzzles and toys which my 4 year old LOVED. It's clear there is a lot of thought and care put in to making this place feel welcoming. I'm so glad we found Craig's place and will definitely book again in the future when we come back to visit."

We cleaned and dried the clothes from the journey here. It's only a few minutes' drive from her home to supermarkets such as Target and Giant, and my son even had his hair cut nearby. I spent a beautiful and quiet night in Jessica's house. This is really great. Additionally, Jessica's response is very fast, and our problem will be quickly resolved. She is friendly and generous. Moreover, her house is worth the money. I will recommend Jessica's home to all my friends. I hope I have another chance to come here!"

Incredibly affordable for the stellar accommodations, I would absolutely recommend Jessica’s place for family/friend trips. Also, given the amount of driving we were doing, it was a great respite spot to recharge, hang out and relax. The locale was peaceful yet not too out of the way, and Jessica’s hospitality was wonderful (we loved the fresh eggs from her chicken left for us in the fridge❤️). Hope to come back some day!"

Stayed with kids","I think Jessica has done a good job making this Airbnb feel as comfortable as possible - some nice touches like water in the fridge and snacks on the counter, nice decorations, etc. However the house itself is only a few feet from a seemingly abandoned, very run down trailer park that made us not feel the safest. I couldn’t honestly give it a 5 compared to some of the other airbnbs I have stayed in, but I appreciated what Jessica has done with the place and the flexibility she gave us in changing the dates (originally booked over Christmas and then our family got Covid and couldn’t make the trip). I would recommend maybe putting up a privacy fence, upgrading the towels and linens to all match, and a few coats of paint and I think this would be a great place to stay."

I also lost the key which I offered to replace but instead she installed a digital lock so that wouldn’t be an issue in the future. The place is nice and clean it has a nice large kitchen and a nice large master bath. I would gladly stay here again if I’m back in the area for work.

Stayed one night","After a long day traveling we arrived to a lockbox that wouldn't work after multiple tries, and soon it was dark while we waited for the host to arrive and unlock the door. No outside light was left on for us, and we had no idea what time, due to traffic problems. Inside is spacious with 2 livings, 2 bathrooms and 3 bedrooms, but... the master bathroom was not clean and the shower curtain and rod were on the floor. The bed in that room was comfortable but not big enough for 2 adults. The second bathroom had no shower mat. We are allergic to scented items, and requested fragrance-free house and linens, which did not happen. In fact, I had to clean the excess fabric softener out of the washer before we could use it, and empty the dryer which was full of laundry. I also cleaned the master bathroom, and ran the dishwasher in order to have breakfast dishes to use. By that time it was rather late and we were very tired, yet needed to take care of some things on WIFI, which is very basic and extremely slow. If you're looking for a place to sleep and not much more, this might be fine. Overall, it's true that you get what you pay for, unfortunately. The plus side were little extras like Qtips and cotton balls in the bathroom, and coffee and bottle water in the kitchen."

We didn’t have a reason to bother the host as all was very well thought out. We hope to stay here again in the future as we have family nearby. Very satisfied customer!"

A little difficult to locate in the dark - it’s at the end of a long driveway and has no windows facing the driveway, so it almost looks like a garage. The entrance is around the side. It does have 2 living areas and split bedrooms, so it is really good for a family."

Stayed over a week","This house was especially clean and very comfortable for us. It is located very near Penn National and South Mountain Golf courses. For bicyclers in good shape or with e-bikes, the road the house is on is busier than expected. However, a quarter mile away is access to a large development for riding which also connects to roads around Penn National and Mount Alto that worked well for riding. The Cumberland Valley Rail Trail is less than a half hour away which begins in Shippensburg plus there are country roads with respectful drivers in that area. Gettysburg is about a half hour away and Michaux State Forest is very close with access to the Appalachian Trail and a Trail Museum. Over all we had a wonderful time and this is a great place to stay! Many thanks to you, Sabrina, and to your family!"

They were very pleased with the condition of the home and the amenities offered (e.g. washer and dryer). The only complaint my husband had was that the bed he slept in was horrible. He said he didn't sleep well as it hurt his back. He recommends replacing it with a more supportive mattress.

The house was spotlessly clean, and contained everything we needed to make it a good stay for the time we were there. We chose to use the pull out bed in the sun room and that worked very well for us. Even though the weather outside was very cold, we opened the door and the window to the sunroom and it warmed up very quickly. The house had a lot of extras like toys, puzzles, games, and a Sling subscription. The host was extremely accommodating and responsive. We had to change the days of our stay at the last minute because of the weather, and they gave us no trouble at all. We plan to stay here again next time we are in the area."

Everything was high-quality and didn't feel like it was going to fall apart when you touched it.
The house was large enough to accommodate our large mashup of guests (2 kids, 2 babies and 7 adults!) comfortably.
Unfortunately we weren't able to get to enjoy the backyard due to the rain, but hopefully the next guest will enjoy the firewood we left in the pit!
Most normal supplies were provided (more than ""one to get you started"" we've seen in other rentals) which was so nice.
A laundry basket, box of tissues and a few dish towels for the kitchen would have been really handy but otherwise we didn't really lack anything.
Mane and Josh were helpful prior to our stay and Mane was responsive when we had a quick question.
Hands down would fully recommend staying here!"

This would be a nice space for a few days stay. There are children there so there was some noise from upstairs but not excessive. And as far as communication, there was the initial message with instructions only. I did send a message saying we checked out and there was no response and I guess there didn't need to be but other hosts have always responded. Check out instructions were very simple, only put towels in hamper, don't strip bed and leave key on table. The home is about 7 miles from I-81."

Stayed with a pet","One of the CLEANEST, cutest, coziest AIRBNBs I've ever rented. I wish I hadn't been basically renting it to sleep :) It really is a sweet little home away from home. All you need are your food, shower items, and hairdryer, and you're set! Decorated beautifully with lots of outlets and lighting (even the outside light works!). Away from town in a peaceful countryside, just beautiful! I've never stayed in a basement apartment, but the noise from upstairs was minimal. The single drawback is how loud the water softener charger is that comes on randomly, just my luck it came on at 2am. It is very loud, woke me from a sound sleep and I had a white noise app running. And it went on for a loooong time."

The apartment is clean, private, quiet and perfectly pet friendly. She and her husband are friendly and glad to help any way they can to make your visit enjoyable.
The only regret I have is that we weren’t there longer so the boys could meet the Bassett hounds and take them for a romp in the pasture.
Thank you Stephanie for sharing your home."

Stayed one night","very nice quiet place without any noise. Perfect for an overnight stay or 2 in a small village near Highway 81 (5 miles). Everything was very clean, coffee, tea, and water bottles provided.
Extra-clean bathroom & shower.
See you next year"
