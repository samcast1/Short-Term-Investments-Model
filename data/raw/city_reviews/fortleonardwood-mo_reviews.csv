Stayed with kids","Attended a graduation at Fort Leonard Wood. This home is PERFECT! We had a large group, 9 adults and 1 infant staying at the home. Never did we feel crowded. The home was very clean and spacious. Very close to Fort Leonard Wood, shops and restaurants. Beautiful neighborhood and friendly neighbors (while we sat on the front porch some waved as they passed). Shawn was extremely quick with responding to any questions or concerns I had. Perfect ""home base"" for anyone attending a graduation at Fort Leonard Wood. Our soldier was able to spend a few days with us and he really loved the home as well. We had multiple vehicles and we were able to utilize the garage, this was extremely helpful and appreciated. Mahalo Shawn for being such an amazing host. If weʻre ever in the area again, I will definitely see if this home is available."

As soon as we walked this home smelled so clean and inviting. It's very spacious and beautiful, the pictures does it know justice. Very close to FLW and restaurants. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here!!!"

We enjoyed coming back with our soldiers to watch movies make a home cooked meal/ grill steaks and enjoy family time . Our soldiers felt at ease here. Getting on and off base was quick and easy since the nearest entrance was free of all the visitor traffic. Katie was accommodating and had the place open for us as we arrived later than expected.

Stayed with a pet","This was my first time booking in AirBnB. We are from New York State and have never even crossed a time zone. We came down for my husband's basic training graduation and booked her Airbnb. Walking in, the place was amazing! so neat and clean. the view was breathtaking, and the house was really nice. On our way down, our car started threatening potential troubles, and we were ready to search for a mechanic. Her brother-in-law, I believe, Don greeted us with a kind smile and a big heart and made us feel so welcome, even helping my father check on our car and make sure we got home safe. Through storms, kitchen needs, and directions, they were ready and willing to help any way they could. I couldn't have asked for a better host and her family! Sweet, amazing people ready to help, a cute house, and a gorgeous, relaxing view. Give stars isn't enough to show how much I recommend them! We hit the jackpot for sure!"

Stayed with kids","My nephew was graduating from the army in Fort Lenord Wood, and we were looking for Air B&B. I read one review from Katie's space, and I chose the spot, and I didn't regret it.
What stood out to us was that when we checked in, the ambiance was amazing. There was juice and water in the fridge, fruits were out in a basket and and a welcome note from Kate, I was blown away.
The space was very clean, cozy, and spacious to accommodate my family.
I would recommend anyone who is visiting the Missouri/Richland area. Katie's place is the space, great rural area, peaceful, quiet when the morning sun comes up it gives you tranquility, then you relax in the jacuzzi tub.
I got a chance to meet her and her husband and what great people they are , thank you Katie, I will definitely be back."

It was a pleasure meeting her and her husband. They are very gracious and sweet people. Praying our soldier doesn’t get stationed up there, but if he does we will definitely be contacting Katie!"

Everything about our stay was great, the house was exceptionally clean and comfortable. We got to see a few deer on our way in. This place is so peaceful, it makes you not want to leave. We already know we will stay here in future travels. Our host was great, she left chocolates and a fridge stocked with drinks, everyone in our group talked about how great coffee was.

Stayed with a pet","Katie’s place was just as described. We took an exit that later turned out to be a gravel road and it took us to our peaceful and safe destination. Upon arrival at 1:30am we noticed the house and surrounding area had great lighting. Check in was a breeze with code. The house was very clean. Katie left a sweet note and even had sodas, water bottles and coffee for us. Beds were comfortable and everyone kept commenting on how spacious and cute it was. Living room & master bedroom had fans. The pups enjoyed the large open yard. There is an area for a fire pit, and also an area with a big grill. There is plenty of parking for multiple larger vehicles. Heads-up, if you’re allergic/sensitive to plug-in scent diffusers let Katie know, there is a few throughout the house
Overall we would recommend anyone to stay here, it sleeps 6 comfortably but if you wanted to bring an extra person, you could. Couch is big enough. If we ever need to rest on our way to Texas. We will surely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","What a beautiful cozy place to stay. It was everything we had hoped for. Katie was so help and responsive. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. The home was extremely clean and we felt so comfortable during our stay. We stayed during our son’s graduation. What Katie didn’t know is that we had actually booked with another AirBnB before booking with her. That host called with less than a week’s notice to say that her listing was all wrong. She requested more money and that we cancel our reservations with her. This left me feeling frantic to say the least. After following up with AirBnB customer service, we went back to available listings and found Katie’s location. She made booking with her so easy. She turned what had been a horrible situation into a positive and joyous experience. I’m so grateful for her hospitality and kindness. We were able to celebrate our son’s important moment, without stress or concern about staying somewhere safe."

Group trip","I can't say enough good things about this house.
I rented this home to spend labor day weekend with my son who is currently in MP training at Ft. Leonardwood.
From the time we walked in the door, it felt so warm and inviting. The bed linens smelled amazing.
The neighborhood was quiet.
It was a great place for him to sit back enjoy some steaks on the grill and family game night."

The house was very roomy and comfortable for 10 people, and also very clean! The pictures don’t do it justice. It’s everything I hoped for and more. I hope to stay there again for our next visit to Missouri. Thanks Thomas!"

The house was big enough/comfortable enough for our family of 9. The pool table was an added bonus for entertaining. Overall the house was great and we didn’t have any major concerns. Some minor concerns were the master bed being too squeaky, also the master bedroom does not have an available closet, more attention to detail for cleanliness, more kitchen items and more cleaning products. We did have to purchase a lot of items in order to cook/clean. Concerns were addressed with the host and they’ve taken them into consideration. Overall we had a great stay and I would recommend this property. Host was very kind and responsive to concerns and responded quickly to messages. Check in/out process was very simple. We would stay here again when traveling to the area."

My favorite part was the hand written note! I really loved that! It felt personalized just for me and my family.
Our family spent a lot of time equally in the home. We spent it playing pool and then in the back yard since the weather was lovely. We cooked and ate and it was just the best intimate family gathering we’ve had in a while. There was no reason to leave. Board games were also available which we loved!
Thanks for having us! And I look forward to booking with you all again soon!"

Group trip","We stayed Sunday through Saturday, and I couldn't recommend a better place to stay. The house felt like you were staying in your own home. There was a welcome note on the table waiting for us. There was something we needed that the house didn't have, but when I contacted them and told them, not only did they respond right away, but they door dashed it. Along with the item, they included some candies. (which was a big hit). The house has a lot of amenities, you won't have to worry about any type of kitchenware, towels, soaps they basically have what you would already have in your own house. There are games for everyone, kids to adults, a pool table, and arcade machine (which was another hit) with everybody in my family. The only thing you will need to be aware of are the steps are narrow, but honestly, it was not a big deal to us. The neighborhood is in a very quiet neighborhood, and stores and restaurants are very close. We would stay here again if we were to come back."

We had young adults traveling with us, 19 & 20 and the floor plan was PERFECT. They enjoyed the game room and bedroom being downstairs away from me and my husband. Thank y’all making this trip even more special. Literally the only thing I had to buy was food which is not usual. The body wash was even top quality. The mattress gave me some of the best sleep.

The kitchen had 3 different ways to make coffee. Full size refrigerator with ice and water. Dishwasher barely made any noise whatsoever. I went back to double check that I actually started it.
The spacious bathroom had plenty of towels. 3 of us took showers in the mornings all back to back and didn’t run out of hot water.
The bedrooms were nice sizes and the beds were comfortable. Loved that I could plug my devices into the lamp and didn’t have to hunt for a plug or pray one was close to the night stand.
Julie was very responsive and let me know the weather could possibly be bad so I could come up with Plan B for food since we originally planned to grill. Gave me suggestions for food options too!

Stayed a few nights","Julie's place was super comfy and clean. Was a great place to stay, made my family feel right at home. Communication with Julie was superb, she is very quick to respond and help with anything you need. She laid out extra bedding for my grandson, and he absolutely loved the little touch and effort she put in to making his stay comfortable and cozy. I highly recommend her and any place she hosts. She and her place were excellent."

This was a very nice place and all the information was great. I can see why he is a super host with the exception of the carpet upstairs. Could be rectified easily with a stiff broom and a vacuum. (And possibly a different cleaning service)
Cheap ceiling fans would be nice in each bedroom for those of us who use them.
I would highly recommend if cleaned better!"

The home was literally minutes from the exit off of I44. It was easy to find and just ducked off into a nice subdivision. The home was exactly as pictured. It was beautifully furnished, clean, and very welcoming! Wifi was great for my teens. The kitchen had everything needed to cook an entire meal. There were 2.5 bathrooms and 3 spacious bedrooms. The views from the two bedrooms were absolutely breathtaking!
Check in and check out was very easy. I will definitely be requesting his space again when we return to FLW for AIT Graduation.
Thank you, Jayson! Your home and hospitality is appreciated!"

It is a townhome duplex located in what appeared to be an apartment complex or or condos maybe. It was quiet and easy navigate.

Stayed with kids",We drove up for our daughters graduation from Tampa Florida and we were pleasantly surprised with the town house. It was clean and cozy. Everything from the beds and linens were amazing and smelled freshly cleaned. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a decent meal for our soldier. There was also plenty of menu options to order take out. I would definitely recommend to anyone who needs to visit especially that the Army base is literally a 15 min drive. The area had enough variety as far as things to do but since we were in town for only 3 days could not take full advantage. I love that we could put our vehicle right into the garage and go in from in there. It was freezing and having that remote control for the garage door made a big difference. The unit also has a washer and dryer which for me is heaven. Traveling with two children under 10 and eating in the vehicle let’s just say there were more than one food disaster. Welcoming /instructions binder was a nice tough.😁

Stayed with kids","It’s a great place located close to fort Leonard wood. Grocery shopping close. Uranus fudge factory close. Dominos close. Does not have a washer and dryer. Be sure to pack enough clothing for duration of stay. We ran out of fresh towels the first day. They provided extra towels the following day per request. Does not accommodate a baby. We had to sleep baby on the bed or on the floor. There is a big garage but it’s locked and not accessible. Outdoor trash cans went missing halfway during our stay and we ended up placing our closed bags of garbage outside by garage door and we were paranoid doing so because we weren’t sure what to do with the collecting garbage. We appreciated the convenience of a vacuum. We asked for an indoor broom which was provided the following day, so we could clean up after ourselves. Parking is at a decline and very close to the street. We wished we could have parked in garage."

It was clean, stocked with the amenities Karen listed. There are streaming options for TV viewing, board games and a gorgeous view from the back porch. The downstairs queen mattress was more of a “futon” type mattress and a bit one the uncomfortable side. But it worked for the amount of time we were there. This was perfect for the few days we stayed."

The balcony to the backyard has a beautiful view and the trees offer privacy from other backyards. Kitchen has all the essentials needed to prepare a home cooked meal for guests, there is also an outdoor grill; the wine cooler and crockpot were great! Rooms are spacious and clean! I loved the master bed&bath! The board games were a great way to enjoy time together without leaving the house and spending money for entertainment. The host was very responsive to inquiries and welcomed our stay. I could go on and on about how great our stay was, but simply put…we felt right at home. We will definitely will use this Airbnb again! Thank you Karen for hosting your home!"

Home is a little tricky at first to get to, especially in the dark, but after a couple of trips to town and back, there was nothing to it. Friendly neighborhood! Master bed/bath was great, and all guests said theirs beds were very comfortable. Top bunk, though, is really not usable due to the closeness of the ceiling fan. Lacks a couple of TVs in the extra bedrooms and a can opener, lol. The back deck is nice. We would definitely rent here again!! Lots of room for everyone!!"

We cooked a large meal with what amenities they provided. Large refrigerator/freezer with ice maker came in handy. Very large flat screen TV in LR for winding down at night. We did not use the outdoor deck or fire pit as it was 95-100 degrees during our stay. The area is a quiet newer housing development a few miles NW of Waynesville but still a short, easy drive to Fort Leonard Wood. Communication with our host Karen was excellent and she was very accommodating with some changes we had. We look forward to staying here again!"

Location: The location was perfect—just a short drive to Fort Leonard Wood, which made attending the graduation events very convenient. Additionally, the property is situated in a quiet and safe neighborhood, ensuring we had a peaceful stay.
Accommodation: The house was spotless and well-maintained, with all the amenities we could have asked for. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we appreciated the thoughtful touches like extra blankets and pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped, allowing us to prepare meals easily.
Amenities: We particularly enjoyed the spacious living area where our family could gather and relax. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, which was important for staying connected with extended family who couldn't make it"

The area this house is located is beautiful and quiet. The rec room in the basement was an excellent area for everyone to relax and have fun. Kitchen has everything a person needs for making a home cook meal. The house is an easy drive roughly 15 minutes from Fort Leonard Wood. Aaron is always responsive for any questions or concerns you may have.
Our daughter graduated basic training 7 months ago and we were in a hotel for family day and graduation. We didn't like the fact that the ten of us couldn't all fit in one room comfortably and enjoy our new soldier's company. This time around we decided to find a nice house to relax in with plenty of room, beds, and bathrooms for us all and this house was the perfect fit.
Thank you again Aaron for the hospitality and the beautiful house."

We utilized the fire pit, the porch and deck and the game room, all were a wonderful way to all be together in the same central location and still have a little change of scenery. It was under 20min to drive to the base, super easy and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals during our stay. If you're here for graduation and you're nervous about not staying on base, don't be! Aaron's home is the perfect location."

She provided a helpful binder of house rules, local recommendations, and useful information regarding the airbnb including the option of purchasing forgotten essentials like tooth brushes. Between that and the complimentary snacks, coffee, and laundry pods we felt like we were staying at a hotel but with all the convenience of staying in a single family home!

100/10 recommend if you are visiting your loved one at Fort Leonard Wood because the drive is super short to get on base. And especially if you are visiting a soldier who is graduating, its the perfect space for them to feel like they are at a home away from home.
We will definitely be booking again"

There’s a nice little back yard, great for letting the kids run around and expend some energy. Lauren definitely earned the “super host” title. Everything was great!"

There’s no other place I would ever want to stay at other than hers. If you’re coming for a graduation, it’s so close to post. If you’re visiting family you’re next to all the best restaurants St Robert has to offer. Please support this wonderful host and her place. It smells amazing inside and has the best “pick me up”coffee bar. You can tell it’s loved and well cared for. 10/10 would recommend!"

The house is also located close to the military base and is also very close to restaurants, gas station, and Walmart. The host communicated quickly and we had zero issues checking in. Lastly, there is a small back yard with a fire pit. The yard is not fenced so keep your dogs on a leash and you will be good.

On the day of check in I was messaged with instructions to get in which was so simple.
The house itself lovely and Miranda goes above and beyond with offering the coffee and had plenty of utensils for us to cook. I was there to visit my Marine and the proximity to FLW was so convenient we were able to go shopping etc on base. I highly recommend this house to anyone especially those that are visiting military service members or for graduations etc due to its proximity to base.
My Marine is not planning on being there for too much longer or else I would already be booking another stay here. But, if he ends up back there I will for sure stay here!
Miranda has definitely set the bar high for staying at an Airbnb.
Thank you for everything and making our trip so memorable."

Stayed with kids","Lisa home was beautiful. She was attentive to detail when decorating her home. It was very homey and spacious. My family and I stayed at a lot of air bnb and she went above- giving complimentary shampoo, conditioner, tooth paste, mouth wash, toothbrush, shaver, and floss in all bathrooms. There was plenty of large towels for everyone. The beds were so comfy and sofas in the living area we’re a great add with the foosball table with an elliptical machine. We traveled with small children-there was cups, cutlery, bowls, and plates for kids to use which for us was a plus. The kids room had a cute table for imaginary play with night lights. Also two balcony’s to sit out and just relax. While being out there temps were in the 90-105 house was comfortable. Thank you Lisa for a wonderful experience."

This is a place I would recommend to anyone on a get away or needing to have a place to stay while their loved one is graduating Fort Leonard Wood. We brought our son back to the house on Family day.

The hot tub was amazing to just relax and enjoy the stars at night! My only true complaint is the bed is a little high to get into and sqeaks when moving around. But other than that I give it 5 stars! Easy door access, host provider all necessary information before our stay, secluded away from the city but a 10min drive into town for the store or restaurants for eating! We didnt use the fire pit but it was nice, chairs provided for sitting, and wood provided to start a fire."

Stayed a few nights","This place is absolute magic! The most perfect location ever. This cabin sits on a little slice of heaven - about a 12 minute drive to everything you could need in town, yet a secluded peaceful cabin in the woods. The views are phenomenal and the extra little touches around the house make it feel so warming. It's all about the little things, like a book that allows other guests to share what they liked around the area; to usb charging ports next to the beds to make it easier to charge your devices. The hot tub is an amazing feature at this location as it is the perfect way to relax and enjoy the beauty all around you. Arron and Michelle were absolutely fantastic when it came to communication, accommodating to our needs and helping us navigate around the area. This was one of the best and most incredible places I've stayed. Highly recommend and would give it way more than the 5 star max."

Stayed with kids","just finished our stay for my brothers BCT graduation & we had the best time. everything was really nice & the cabin felt like home. super clean & close to the base! I will say, be cautious if having children play outside, or if you try to go on a walk because there was some speeding in the neighborhood. Host was extremely helpful & I’m so lucky we found this gem!!"

Plenty of comfortable beds, nice bathrooms, and great kitchen. We can't say enough wonderful things about this home. Highly recommended to anyone looking to make awesome family memories!"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed the house- very comfortable and had everything we needed and then some! Very welcoming home with plenty of space to share family time all together or go off to our separate spaces for reading, gaming, etc. The hot tub was an added bonus and the view of the stars from the back deck was gorgeous! The owners were very easy to communicate with and it is clear that they put a lot of love and care into their rental for your enjoyment- from the welcome note (thank you again!) to the small details that are so big like leaving a washing machine pod & dryer sheet (that was a life saver with a little one)…we felt like we were staying at a friend’s house. Very close to Fort Leonard Wood and all the stores/restaurants in the area to include the quirky area known as Uranus (yes, it is awkwardly spectacular for all the reasons you would expect). Would definitely rent this home again if life brings us back to Missouri. Thank you so much for such a great experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Don’t hesitate - book the cabin! It was even more spacious and beautiful in person. You will not be disappointed. I grew up in Steelville (known for cabins/floating) & this beats any local resort by a mile. The kitchen is big enough for making a nice dinner. There is plenty cabinet space for organizing food and belongings. The bath & shower in the master room is to die for. Water pressure is great & gets super hot. The living area is sooo cozy & the patio is spacious with a hot tub. It stormed during our trip, but the fire pit set up they had was adorable too. If you have kids, they have the perfect room set up for them with two loft beds, a pull out couch, roomy closet & tv set up. My son has ASD, and had no issues being scared or feeling uncomfortable. They had fans and lamps in the lofts for him. Usually he’s dying to get home, this time I had to make him to leave he was so happy. Hosts are great, neighbors are quiet. Plenty of privacy while still being close to town. 11/10 spot!"

When we had questions on the surroundings on where to go Aaron was more than helpful with detailed locations. We used the cabin for a quick stay for a retirement party on Fort Leonard Wood and if we ever had any other business on this post I would save the time trying to find anywhere else and would hope this place would be available."

Stayed with kids",Loved the location and ease of direction to the base. This location is within military base boundaries for family day pass leave which made this a plus. Was able to take our son and his battle buddy for a day off base and family cooking. It snowed when we were there so was unable to use the spa however it was easily accessible. Bathroom was gorgeous with amazing water pressure and hot water. Owner was flexible with checkin time which helped so we could empty the car to make room for the guys. Short distance from Walmart and food locations. Definitely a great find.

Stayed one night",We were looking for a small getaway and our stay at the cabin was exactly what we needed. Pictures will not do justice for how beautiful this cabin is. I thought it was very interesting to see the history behind the cabin and how well they have transformed it. We really enjoyed the outdoor hot tub and appreciated the host greatly for accommodating us on our trip. Very quick and easy to get in contact with if you need anything at all. Very highly recommend!!
