Stayed with a pet","This is just a beautiful location. It’s close to I-40. The place was bigger than we expected. Don’t sleep on the local establishments. Junkyard Brewery is a gem! The owner is retired Air Force and although he has a small menu and small brew, it’s an incredible experience.
Close to Bandera Volcano, which is a hidden gem as well. It’s a must see!
I would come back here in a heartbeat."

Stayed over a week","I loved my stay in San Rafael with Nicole & Pete. The place is cozy and well-appointed, was super clean, had everything I needed. I enjoyed waking up to the birds singing and seeing the amazing views. I had quick access to town and also ventured around El Malpais and the Ice Caves, just down the road. Nicole & Pete were very friendly and welcoming; the experience was peaceful and stress-free, and I definitely would stay here again."

Stayed one night","Highly recommend. This space was even better than I expected! This stand alone casita felt newly built with all the amenities on what appears to be a small family farm or homestead situation. I was there on a quick overnight stop so I didn’t cook although they had a few appliances like an induction burner and a shallow countertop oven in the case you need to prepare meals. The bed was comfortable. The shower was beautifully tiled with good water pressure. Streaming apps were logged in on both TVs (living & bedroom) so I could unwind with a movie. The only negative was that the internet was too slow for streaming without pausing to buffer every 2-3 minutes. So. I logged the TV in to my personal hotspot via Verizon and it worked great.
Next time I’m in the area, I would love to book this spot again. Thanks for having me!"

There was a lot of fragrance, but I didn't specify my sensitivity to that before hand, so it's nothing against them. The communication was great and the sweet farm animals outside were fun to see.

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay here. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Easily the most comfortable bed that I've slept in.
The house itself wasn't well signed - my maps told me that I was there but I couldn't see a house number to confirm - it was in a pretty quiet neighborhood just off the freeway.
We were on a cross-country move so we didn't try to do anything or go anywhere. We arrived late at night and left first thing in the morning, but it was a great stay."

My only frustration was my own AR/OCD tendencies to take Pete's directions of ""3.5 miles off I-40"" too literally, as it was actually four (4) miles off the interstate! But that, in no way, detracted from my stay and would most definitely stay there again."

Stayed with a pet","We were lucky to book this last minute! After a terrible start to our cross country move with nasty dog friendly hotels we were so happy to find this gem. We needed space for our two fur babies and 7 month old to run around, we definitely got that. A bonus was the baby cows and sheep right outside the front door. We had arrived late in the day so we didn’t get the chance to see them but we woke up and spent some time watching them have breakfast. Our little girl was in love with them and gave a sense of calm before another long day of travel. Great property, easy access from the 40 and I had wished we had more time to explore the nearby outdoor activities."

Stayed with kids",I absolutely loved our short stay here as an in between stop for our road trip. The bed was amazingly comfortable and such a cute little casita. We were welcomed to a pleasant smelling candle lit for us. It was so cold outside the shower was huge and the water was hot just what we needed for some R&R after a long day in the car. We usually stay in Albuquerque however I love that this is away from the city but still close to the highway it felt much safer for us and our daughter.

Stayed with a pet","On the tail end of a 2-week road trip, this comfortable space was perfect for what we needed. It is clean and welcoming with comfortable furniture and a TV in the bedroom (we love that!). The bathroom is one of the cleanest we've had during our trip and the shower was actually our favorite thing. It's HUGE! The king-sized bed is so very comfortable and the linens are clean and fresh. The space is actually much bigger than it looks in the photos. It is close to I40. We arrived after dark and it was easy to find. The hosts gave specific instructions on where to park and how to get in and that was super helpful. We walked our dog in the neighborhood and for the short time we were there, we felt right at home. Fast WiFi for those (like me) who have to work on the road. We would definitely return if we find ourselves in the area. Book with confidence."

There is also a sheep that were on the property that were fenced in. That were cute. Perfect for stay the night or two to rest up in your travels. Pete & Nicole were very responsive, and kind.

The bed was very comfortable as well and we got a great nights sleep while on the road. There’s several food places and a walmart right up the road. The air conditioner worked well for the summer heat and we were able to park on property, which always makes me feel more comfortable when traveling instead of street parking. There are a few amenities available if you forget something- shampoo/soap and a keurig coffee machine. Utensils as well, but anything else- plan on bringing (water bottles, ice mold, toothpaste, hair dryer, etc.) great spot if looking for a quiet night to rest!"

It's in a very rural area, and I was so thankful to find an airbnb rather than a hotel. this place is gorgeous on the inside, once again this place is in the middle of a very rural area, we were nervous we were going the wrong way but Maps took us straight there! This place is GORGEOUS on the inside, I felt like I was in a fancy hotel, the bathroom was beautiful with a big shower, the bed was super comfy and big, the living room had a big couch and a TV for us to watch. Heaters inside the home to keep us warm, it was perfect. I will warn you, if you're in town Sunday or Monday there is almost no places to eat other than fast food, but the Dennys was delicious!"

The home was very clean and tidy and there was more than adequate heating througout the home during our winter stay. The host/hostess responded quickly to our inquiries and provided helpful recommendations. For those traveling to/from the Phoenix area from this rental, we found that the driving time of about 6 hours was perfect for us. There are several sit-down and fast food restaurants within 5-10 minutes. This property is located next to a dirt/gravel road very close to the main highway and appears to be the nicest and best maintained home in the surrounding area. In fact, it was a pleasant surprise to enter the home and feel as though we were walking into a new model home!"

Stayed one night","We had a comfortable one night stay while passing through. We showed up right after booking, about 15 minutes early so they were still cleaning which probably explains why it didn't feel fully clean when we got inside. We had to run the vacuum over the couch to get rid of some dog hair and I quickly wiped down the toilet as I saw a few hairs on the seat. Not a big deal and again, we likely unintentionally made them feel rushed. The bed was comfortable and shower hot with good water pressure. Adding a shelf or stand in the shower to put soap/shampoo would be good, as well as getting a couple bed-side tables for phones and water. We had a nice dinner at the local steakhouse a few miles away. Would stay again if passing through."

Stayed with kids","Erlinda's place was a great place to stay and we would book again. Keeping in mind that Gallup doesn't exactly have new construction or luxury accommodations, we had everything we needed, because the place is very well stocked with basics such as water, tissues, and cooking condiments that no one wants to buy for just one weekend.
Random facts for people who really care about these things: showers are hot with great water pressure. Mattresses are comfortable with two soft pillowtops, and one nicely firm mattress. Toilets are a bit small for my big bum, but were great for our little one."

Ran into some trouble finding the place late at night on top of that a train blocked the road I was on and wasn’t moving for the night and she helped me get to it and gave the warmest welcome when I finally got there. , Being how late it was and me having trouble, I thought the opposite was going to happen. The motel it is not modern or updated or anything (maybe except for the flooring) but it’s clean and in a safe environment and I love that it was affordable."

Probably the biggest downside is that the train tracks run a few hundred feet behind the place so you will hear them a bit as they go by. But the host did get back to me immediately after booking to ask what type of room I wanted. One more thing to be aware, the address listed is correct but when you click the directions button in app, it sends you to a motel just down the street. Airbnb should hopefully look into that."

Stayed one night","We read the description wrong. We read ""Budget Inn"" as an inn/motel for people on a budget, not literally a Budget Inn. We were expecting a small mom-and-pop place, not a corporate chain, the latter of which in our opinion goes against the whole concept of Airbnb. As for the place itself, it was okay: it has comfy beds and has a great heater, but noise-wise you can hear through the ceiling, not just the person above you but also clicking in the wall from their heater when it is in use. Overall, the building is old and beat up, with the bathroom and exterior not as nice as the pictures show. It is a decent, bare-bones place to arrive at night, sleep, and leave the next morning, but I wouldn't recommend it for much more than that."

We had a couple of bumps in our stay; however, the host was responsive to get things taken care of."

The airbnb has a large bathroom with anything you need and a super comfy bed. Would definitely stay here again!"

The best part might have been the dogs as I was missing my dogs. As a previous review mentions, there is a hallway between the main space and the bathroom that is divided from upstairs by a curtain, but both the main space and bathroom have locking doors and I always felt very comfortable. Alray and Brennan’s communication was excellent. They are very kind and happy to help with any needs. I definitely recommend staying here!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for 2 weeks for temporary work in Gallup. Overall this place worked out well and I would recommend it to others.
Pros:
-Convenient location, short drive (or even walk) to hospitals, many food options. Area feels very safe.
-Good sized space, larger than I expected from the photos. The bathroom is quite large as well, plenty of room for suitcases/hanging and storing clothes/etc. I appreciated having a couch in addition to the bed.
-Quite a few kitchen utensils and appliances which made it easier to have meals there instead of eating out for every meal. Mini-fridge available.
-Alray promptly responded to any questions or concerns
Minor reservations:
-The space is not 100% private. You enter through a locked door to the bedroom/kitchen/living area, then another door to a hallway, then a separate door to the bathroom. In the hallway area there is another door (to the garage perhaps?) and a staircase that leads up to the rest of the house. The staircase is covered with a curtain, but not a door. Although this was never a problem during my stay, I was surprised to see part of the space was separated by a curtain rather than a lock-able door. It -is- possible to lock the door between the bedroom and hallway, thus keeping only the bedroom private.
-The dogs were friendly, but I am generally comfortable around dogs. They are big and will greet you when exiting the space. They also bark during the day. There are other neighborhood dogs that also bark loudly (no fault of these dogs or their owners). It wasn't bothersome since I worked during the day and wasn't in the space.
-Since this is a ground-level space, I noticed some ants. There was Raid available and Alray promptly contacted an exterminator to spray the outside of the home the next day.
-This is a good space for 1 or 2 adults. It would be uncomfortable for any children or more than 2 people."

Had everything that I needed, granted it didn't have a kitchen and being an avid cooker, my meals took twice as long to cook with the plug in 2-burner, but hey something is better than nothing. The location is great, RMCH is a 5-7 min walk or a 1-2 min drive literally up the street and stores near by. The best part of the stay were the dogs, super duper nice always requesting belly rubs. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Gallup. The hosts were great, addressed any issues I had in a timely manner.

Stayed a few nights",Had s bad experience here at Alray and Brennen’s. I booked this place and followed the check in instructions for the door lock but the bottom lock was locked and it was pouring down rain and a wet dog jumped on me and got my muddy. I called the host but his phone was off I sent messages to the host via the Airbnb app no response. After waiting over an hour one of the hosts came home and didn’t even apologize for me waiting. When I came in The place looked nice and clean until I went to plug my chargers in bedside and found a black widow literally below the bed near where my head would be sleeping and there was s bunch of little black bugs under the bed I went and vacuumed them up. The next issue were the dogs! Two nice dogs and one dog that growls and is very mean. These dogs were a constant problem they dug a hole next to the door and flung dirt right up where the door is. They were jumping on me and the worst of all they run off if given the chance. Came back one day to find all three dogs had gotten out the guy who was staying with me grabbed one and out him inside and tried to grab the mean one and the dog bit him. I called the host to tell him the dogs got out and the mean one bit Kevin and not even an apology didn’t ask if he was all right nothing. In my opinion place is over priced and the description mentions puppies but they are not puppies and they added a tremendous amount of stress to my work trip. I wouldn’t stay here again if it was offered to me free.

It’s also walking distance from two hospitals, including GIMC. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, Alray and Brennan are exceptional hosts - responsive, understanding, helpful, and welcoming. Would definitely stay at their place again."

The one downside is the fair level of ambient noise (fan, clock, hosts upstairs, etc.) that took my wife and I a little bit of time to adjust to. We might recommend ear-plugs for other noise-sensitive guests."

I was able to cook meals there, study, and relax. They have one of the most beautiful views in Gallup and they both were very helpful and knowledgable whenever I had any questions.
The neighborhood is quiet and safe. There is a small porch that is lit by Xmas lights and perfect for reading. It was centrally located--coffee shops, restaurants, and convenience stores are 5 minutes away.

Their space looks just like the pictures- beautiful, nicely decorated and cozy. We had a great stay except for one minor incident. One night, one of their dogs started barking in the middle of the night, right outside our window. He woke us up a few times, but when I contacted Alray, he took care of it immediately and we were back to sleep in that comfy bed in no time. I'm sure future guests will have nothing to worry about, since we were one of the first guests they've had stay there, and it's a new situation for everyone. Thanks Alray for a great stay!"

Both Brennen and Alray were very respectful, easy to communicate with, and always made us feel right at home. This was both mine and my best friends first time ever being away from home, and every time we came home from work we said it was our home away from home. Their house is absolutely beautiful and in a quiet/safe neighborhood. Another thing we loved so much, are their dogs Ralphie and Riley. It took a little while for Ralphie to warm up to us, but Riley always greeted us when we came home or even came to say good morning to us. They are great dogs! I would definitely highly recommend Alray and Brennen and their home. We were truly blessed to have met them and we can now call them our friends. We can't wait for future travel events with them! We already have two planned :) They are both two fun people with huge hearts, a beautiful home, and beautiful playful dogs.

The amount of work done to the place was evident. Great aesthetic. Whitney has great taste! The addition of cots was awesome and we appreciated the water station. So glad we stumbled upon this listing.

It was pretty windy when we arrived and once inside, we couldn’t hear a thing. We are two friends traveling through the area, it was great that we each had our own bathroom and the place was quiet…in our rooms we couldn’t hear each other at all. An easy drive to El Morro and Bandera volcano and ice cave."

The house is nicely decorated, has all the amenities you need for a short stay, and it's set apart from other houses so it feels very private.
The WiFi at the house was reliable and fast enough for me to work. However, my cell signal in the area was non existent. It's important to look up the address and directions to the place before you get there!!"

The swamp cooler which was wonderful. Made for very comfortable sleeping during hot summer nights. Great for star gazing as well. Highly recommend. A great alternative to staying in Gallup or Grants. Plus Whitney was a great host! She was very attentive but also gave us plenty of privacy. Definitely will be staying here again."

Check in was super easy and keyless entry was a big plus. Again, Meghan clearly did everything possible to make her property an amazing place to stay. The only downside to the stay was beyond her control. We travel with our dog and the enclosed backyard was a major decision in choosing this listing. Sadly, the neighbors had several dogs that repeatedly charged the cyclone fence when we attempted to enjoy the backyard. It essentially made the yead unusable, which was a great shame. Otherwise, we thought the home was a very pleasant place to stay."

Spacious rooms and comfortable beds and chairs two adults and two kids had enough room to spread out after a long road trip. Clean space! Bedding soft and pillows nice. The decor is minimal and well thought out - matched the pictures and description perfectly - we felt right at home! The kids loved the feel of the soft rugs in bedroom and living. The sound of the trains outside town was not disruptive to our sleep in the least - ear plugs were available (a nice touch!) but we didn’t need them - distant enough was more of a comforting white noise. When we come back through Hollbrook this will be the place we pick again!

Nothing like checking into a rental after a long day of travel, hiking and exploring and getting that super clean sense of smell! Super easy check in and the house was well equipped. Had everything we needed for making dinner and breakfast each day.
We did not explore Holbrook itself, besides a couple of cool rock shops and the very close Safeway. But you could easily walk to several restaurants and cool little stores. The house is very centrally located in this small town.
The Petrified forest National Park is what brought us to Holbrook and one of my favorite parks, a can't miss if you stay here.
Meghan's place had everything setup, plenty of towels, linens, recommendations and a well equipped kitchen. One of the best Air B&B's we have stayed at.
The only thing that would have made the place better, would be having a washer and dryer."

We felt welcomed the minute we stepped through the door. It’s located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a Safeway just 1/2 a mile away.
It was nice to be able to park the car in a covered carport with an easy walk to the front door for unloading suitcases, etc. And the driveway accommodated our 16’ moving truck (for our cross-country move.) There’s also lots of street parking available.
Located so close to the Petrified Forest, we wish we had time to explore the area - next time!
Communication with Meghan was clear and enjoyable from start to finish - we really enjoyed our stay in their beautiful place. Would HIGHLY recommend if you’re ever in the area."

There is a train that rolls by fairly often, not loud enough to wake us from sleep but loud enough to hear when awake. Host provided ear plugs for night if someone is a light sleeper. Overall, we definitely enjoyed our stay."

Stayed one night","Jeff's place made up our quirkiest accommodations on a trip to Arizona and New Mexico. It's off the beaten path but there's some really pretty country nearby and it was a nice change of place from more crowded destinations, like Sedona.
The ""Cowboy Cruiser"" was more spacious than we expected, and the bed was eminently comfortable. The shower was fine, considering it's inside an RV.
The best part about staying here is Jeff himself. He's a good chef (we requested a vegetarian meal for dinner in addition to the usual breakfast) and we enjoyed talking with him very much as we ate and afterwards. It turns out he's married to a Polish woman from a city that my wife and I had visited and loved, so it was fun to hear about that.
So, if you want to be far from the madding crowd, with a great host and a quiet location and good food, Mountain Harmony just might be what you are looking for."

He was very hospitable, great conversation, and provides a delicious breakfast which was such an added bonus. This location is very peaceful. Go ahead and book, you won't be disappointed.

Beata & Jeff are the best, so warm and friendly and make you feel right at home. Jeff was quick to help me charge up my electric car and help with the air conditioning.
I had a very comfortable and cozy nights sleep and waking up to the most amazing sunset was bliss.
Beata made a wonderful breakfast, so healthy and tasty. Was great to have a home cooked meal to send me on my travels. I will absolutely be back. Can’t thank them enough 😁🙏😎"

Stayed a few nights","So many good things to say about this property, so where do I begin: (in no special order)
1) Location, location, location….central to so many things, it’s a great base (Gallup, Grants, El Morro, El Malpais, Ice Cave, etc.)
2) Unique accommodation…camper beat a traditional hotel, for sure! Had everything you’d need. Included bottled water and snacks..very nice touch!
3) Camper was super clean
4) Food was excellent! Great value to include breakfast, and it was a hearty one at that. I also purchased dinner both nights, and the fare rivaled restaurant quality. Soup, salad, entree, dessert…all delicious and with a great presentation. I ate in the cafe area, which was very pleasant.
5) Hosts - they seem like very kind, sincere people. They have a great “vibe”
I’d definitely stay again, but want to stay longer. Thank you Beata & Jeff. Dziekuje! 😀"

Little patio is awesome with the bunnies running around with view , hmm pretty awesome. Dinner usually offered (for a great price) and is made to order delicious . Soup is like from the old country (Poland ) awesome , you will never taste again unless you move to Europe.
Salad (mustard dressing is a home run) entree changes with your tastes in mind. Ice cream with lemon cello from Sardinia. Hmm, while watching the sunset . Super comfy bed , awesome sheets, full WiFi and Verizon.

Stayed one night","Great spot to land whether passing thru on a road trip, or taking a planned trip to see the myriad of majestic natural wonders that abound in this part of the country. There’s so much to see within driving distance of this place, you really should stay several days or longer if possible. And make sure you take them up on the offer for dinner (a small charge and totally worth it!) or any other meal besides the included breakfast, because the food they make is certainly on par with a nice restaurant’s quality, if not gourmet. I had the best soup of my life there! And everything was masterfully done, none of it overly fancy or seasoned, just inspired straightforward and delicious real ingredients with love. Plus they can suit it to any taste, although I strongly recommend you go with chef’s choice (otherwise it’s like only handing Picasso two or three colors of paint.. ya know?!). Nothing beats a homemade meal done right, which they certainly do. Plus there ain’t much else around if anything at all to choose from anyways, so they actually could be serving lower quality food and get away with it, but they would never do that - they are really good people who want to treat others right and well, and they do. Even if there are other choices around, I would stay right here every time. The place was so peaceful and serene, such a good vibe and welcoming feeling from the hosts, that honestly it took me a little longer to leave than I intended! You may well get that feeling too, at least a little bit, like you don’t want to leave: this place not only refreshes your energy better than a hotel stay would, but I swear even your soul can get a refresh here if you allow it to. The property, the place, and the access to so many ways to spectacularly connect to nature are all big parts of what makes this a great experience.. then add to that the great hosts and that’s what puts it over the top as such a special stay. This is the place you go stay for 5-7 days to totally get away and come out of it feeling completely refreshed and renewed and reconnected to yourself and what really matters. But it is also perfect for someone passing thru for the night, far better than a hotel - there’s no comparison. It’s a great RV with everything you need and more, and very private. Mind that you are not going to get an unlimited amount of hot water in the shower at one time, but you can get a good one if you don’t dally. As a tall person, the shower head was even with mine, but it is the removable style with a hose so no problem. I was so fulfilled by the day of touring around, the fabulous dinner, the great company, the infinite stars you see at night and the sweet clean air that I didn’t even want to turn on the TV when I retired to my quarters. I just enjoyed how peaceful and still it all was, that I had no walls shared with others, how great it felt to be where the hosts were so kind and caring and available yet will gladly leave you to yourself if that’s what you want.. that I just sat there for awhile appreciating what seemed like one of the few spots left in the world where things are not rushed nor constantly demanding. Then I did some reading and writing before passing out and sleeping wonderfully. The outside air can cool down a lot at night which makes for great slumber, but there is a heater available if needed that works fine to warm the unit. I decided to turn it off and just got under the big comforter and slept like a log. After a few days on the road in thankless slacking overpriced hotels that seemingly drained more energy than they replenished, this was the splendid respite I sorely needed to refresh my body and spirit. Like I said, the hosts being that perfect balance of happily there to make your stay the best it can be, yet at the same time they aren’t prying or spying or micro-managing you like some other hosts can do. After a meal at the really cool main house that looks like a former bar/restaurant inside on the first floor and has a beautiful mural and awesome artwork displayed, you can sit outside on the covered or uncovered portion of the decks and chat with others, walk up one flight of stairs to the upper porch and see the dormant volcanoes on the nearby horizon then catch a glorious sunset above majestic reefs right there, or you can head on back to your space or on your way with no issue at all. I was able to totally relax and unwind there like you cannot really do at most places. Very grateful, much love. P.S. the GPS can have you several miles off from this place so follow the host’s short easy directions to find the place at the end"

Stayed a few nights","This a big house with all new furniture, appliances, flooring and a fresh coat of paint. I was the first guest and the host was responsive and communicated well to my questions.
One block from the hospital if you’re working or visiting there or a short drive to Gallup center. Great as a starting point for day trips to Zuni and national monuments/parks in the area."

Stayed with kids","Shane's place was great! It was very spacious and fairly clean. It was very nice AirBnB option for Gallup. There were a few cons, but nothing too major considering we were just there to visit family. The restroom does need a ventilation fan, since there's only one restroom. It would have been nice to have a larger bed, because my husband is 6'4"". The neighbors' dogs to the west/right of the house, next to the bedrooms, barked a lot during the night. They kept my husband up half the night, most nights. I'm sensitive to strong scents, so the air fresheners hurt my nose, but I definitely will ask that they be removed prior to check-in the next time we stay. Overall, we liked the location and how spacious the house was. We will definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","This was one of my favorite bnb’s
Many locations ive stayed in feel thrown together, impersonal and uninviting but this place was very inviting. It felt very welcoming and cozy, i also want to note it was one of the most well equipped bnb locations ive stayed at.
Cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, paper towels, toilet paper, coffee creamer
Many hosts dont have cleaning supplies and it drives me crazy because if i bring in dirt or i spill something i want to clean it up.
Shanes home had everything we needed.
My husband and i slept well in the bed, we loved the garage access to park in so the van was not freezing in the morning.
Everything worked it was perfect.
I without a doubt would stay here again.
My single complaint has nothing to do with shanes home but with the neighbor. I was very saddened by a neighbor who had a large dog and small dog outside all night in the pouring rain and 33 degree weather.
The dogs barked for hours probably desperate to be inside the warm house"

Stayed with kids","With very little options for a place to stay for 5 people, we were lucky to have come across Shane's property especially being located in a good and quiet neighborhood.
Most listings we saw didn’t have a full kitchen, so we appreciated that this one did, plus a washing machine which was a lifesaver. However, the bathroom window does not open and there's no fan so ventilation was an issue.
The house is old so the wood floors do squeak and the train horn kept a lot of us up during the night. I thought my bed was fine but other guest felt their beds were too hard/stiff. We did have a mishap with no toilet paper in the house, so I made a run to the store.
Luckily, Shane was very quick to respond and I was reimbursed. We didn’t have any more issues during the rest of our stay."

Stayed one night","Very seldom have I wholeheartedly and with clear conscience raved in my reviews about an individual AirBnB lodging. Bruce’s cabin in Thoreau is one of those exceptions. From the proactive and thoughtful communications before our arrival, to the moment we set foot on the property, and then when we closed the doors to travel on, I knew I’d found and experienced something special. The cabin overlooks Blue Lake State Park, and the area surrounding the cabin is private, quiet and very peaceful. Bruce has quite a few bird feeders, so you have endless opportunity to birdwatch from the comfort of the screened porch or inside from the large windows that afford wonderful views. Everything inside the cabin is meticulously clean and comfortable, and whatever you might need for cooking or small cleanups is available. I wish I’d planned to stay longer and I’d love to return. This place is indeed very special. My most sincere thanks to our host."

The host is most welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. He's very accommodating, if you wish to have absolute privacy, he will leave you be. Or, he will freely engage with you and offer you a chance to purchase authentic vintage Native American works of art (at a fair price).
I'll probably bring my mother up here one long weekend, here soon"

Stayed a few nights","The McCrae Cabin is is a masterpiece of old world craftsmanship, from the panned windows that let in sunlight in the winter (and the breeze during hot months) to the built-in cabinets to the flawless dowelled hardwood floor. Seriously, if you're a carpenter or a woodworker, come for a night just to check out the living room floor.
The hot tub was hot and easy to use, and the view from it was peaceful. There were a dozen different birds at the well-stocked feeders, red-wing blackbirds, scrub jays, even a Lewis's Woodpecker, a spectacular bird I'd never seen before. The books Bruce left out gave some great context for the area and were perfect for a weekend read.
Bruce's acreage was secluded enough for privacy, but at the end of the road in a charming community where neighbors were close enough (and friendly enough) that we didn't feel completely isolated either--perfect in case of trouble.
Photos don't do this place justice. Bruce was a great host. If you're on the fence, book it."

There are neighbors close by on one side of the property, but the deck and hot tub are on the other side where it’s just a lake view! Bruce is an AMAZING host, we had a slight issue come up during the stay and he was immediately there to fix it. This cabin has everything you could need, every condiment and cooking utensil- Brice even left us some groceries! It is quite far from town, which we loved, but you would want to bring all your food. The fireplace was awesome with pretty much unlimited firewood. The furnace made it nice and warm. We loved the board games and the book collection. It’s fun to watch all the birds and chipmunks in the morning at all the feeders. There is no WiFi, but we had good reception with Verizon. We brought travel speaker and had great music all weekend. Overall this little cabin is just a dreamy place to unplug and unwind!"

Very thoughtful host providing eggs, butter, coffee & filters, dark chocolate, lots of firewood, extra towels and blankets, snow shovel, and plenty of bird seed. We spent our mornings in the hot tub just watching the birds; evenings in the hot tub looking at the stars, before reading near a cozy fire. Bruce was quick to respond to questions and work with us when we had to extend our stay due to winter weather (which worked out since there wasn't another check-in for that weekday). It was the perfect getaway to start the new year. We'd make it an annual vacation if we could! Thank you, Bruce!"

Stayed one night","Bruce and his cabin are absolutely worth the trip to Thoreau. I really can’t say enough about this place but, I will try.
I was excited when I found this cabin and boy does it not disappoint. It sits over a valley with a wonderful view of the sunrise and is warm and cozy inside. A great place to run the dog(s) out in the morning before getting back in the car.
Bruce feels like a kindred spirit of some sort. He is on top of messaging and making sure you are comfortable and looked after. All of the amenities are wonderful and well maintained, not to mention growing! He has recently added another deck and hot tub that I will have to come back and use at some point. There are new fire pits / grill areas and even a walking trail through the back acreage.
For me, it’s the small things. Bruce had prebuilt a fire for me, all I had to do was light it upon arrival. Stuff like that makes the stay truly wonderful. Thanks Bruce, I will definitely be coming back."

The view is astounding, there are several decks and look out points as well as several acres of hiking. My mother and I stayed at the cabin while we were traveling and the only thing we regret is not spending more time here. Our two dogs and one cat also had a wonderful time, it was so nice to have a quiet place to let them rest from the over-stimulation of traveling. Bruce is an amazing host and seemed to have thought of everything. We had the place to ourselves and we’re able to meet him at check out, he is an awesome person and it was the perfect experience. We plan to stay here again."

I love vintage vibes and my partner looks for a place to be clean and organized and this cabin impressed us both.
Bruce was an excellent host and provided so many thoughtful amenities. For example, extra birdseed located conveniently by the bird feeders. Or, everything you possibly need to build a fire close at hand.
We were sad to go and are already making plans to come back next year!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful rustic cabin with a million dollar view. We were looking for THE cabin in New Mexico, and we found it. The kitchen is very easy to use with the refrigerator, utensils, spices, pots/pans & oils at a single reach with multiple tables to sit and eat. Multiple places to sit & take in the breathtaking views. Comfortable bed with plenty of storage Very clean & well stocked bathroom. All of the cabin’s art has history (ask Bruce), there’s books and books of historic information available and there’s a plethora of antique items placed around the property.
Bruce is a gold plated platinum host, there wasn’t a question he couldn’t answer and made perfect suggestions for things to do while we were there. Great person, stellar host.
And speaking of things to see, we took hundreds of scenic photos within a 10 mile radius.
It’s an A+ property. Quiet, secluded and relaxing atmosphere … the kind of place you shed a tear or two because you have to leave."

You get to watch the “birds show” during breakfast and hang out at the lake during the day. The food options are a bit far off but very tasty, including Gabbys Wow Diner and Spicy Bite Indian food in Milan about 40 minutes away. Highly recommend this place for complete relaxation!"

Stayed with a pet","We frequent Air Bnbs all over, and have discovered two types of hosts... ones out to make a buck and ones who genuinely care about their guests and their experience away from home. Bruce falls into the 2nd category. He was very accessible and provided all sorts of recommendations for hikes and drives. His cabin was immaculate and fully equipped with everything we needed. What we thoroughly appreciated was his attention to detail and the touches that made his cabin feel like home rather than a rental. He had bird feeders out and provided binoculars and a bird book. We loved the solar lights that led to a beautiful deck and a gorgeous view of the lake. His firepit and fireplace were nicely prepped with wood for a fire. And, he thoughtfully put out fresh fruit, yummy chocolates and refreshing drinks. We had the pleasure of meeting him upon departure and he was a delight. We highly recommend this place to get away from city life."

They slept deeply after enjoying a quiet evening by the fireplace. I walked our 90-pound dog around the area, and he found many interesting things to sniff and check out. After my parents turned in for the night, I sat in the hot tub for 20+ minutes, enjoying the silence, the star-filled sky, and the ambiance of his cabin. Bruce is a gentleman. A good, good guy and a wonderful host. We will definitely stay there again, in the fall, on our way back to back to the beaches of Baja Sur, Mexico."

Bruce was hands down amazing, he shared so much knowledge on the area and areas to explore and went above and beyond.

Bruce had food available for a breakfast, tons of other kitchen amenities, clean bathroom and an amazing bed. More time would have been spent on the porch, walking the land, and of course more time in front of the fire! I had forgotten the sweet smell of piñon wood fires.
Very quiet! I felt bad shutting the door of my truck 😂
Perfect getaway for a couple that loves being remote or through travelers like myself.
I stopped off in town and grabbed a burger at Big Ass Burger before heading to the cabin.
I really appreciated the little things like the fresh fruit on the table, the art and pottery collection, and the hand made cards for sale found on the hardwood and turquoise “candy stand” I definitely plan to return and stalk some fish in the lake, hopefully in a few months for the spring muskies! Thanks again Bruce 😀"

Stayed a few nights","The area around this cabin is a real gem of a spot in the four corners area. It doesn’t get much attention, but there are lots of very quiet canyons and forests nearby, with deer, elk and abundant wildflowers. The cabin itself is at high elevation (over 7000’) so the climate is more like Flagstaff than Gallup, surrounded by pine trees and cool breezes. The cabin itself is cozy and spotlessly clean, filled with thoughtful touches - food, books, binoculars, games, firewood etc. The cell reception is very good (Verizon), so no Wi-Fi necessary. The nearby lake isn’t at it’s highest level these days, but adds to the lovely view still. We used the cabin as a base camp for exploring the Zuni mountains and day trips in the four corners region. We could have spent many more days and not run out of fun adventures. Not everything in the Zuni range is well documented, so local advice and a sense of adventure is helpful. Zero crowds, a huge plus for us."

The fishing is really good right now but we’ll be going in the winter too just to get away from the city. We look forward to our next trip in the near future. Thanks for everything Bruce :)

It’s perfect for my family. The extra care from Bruce is beyond anything we’ve experienced in ALL of our trips! He’s like, the cool neighbor, looking out for you in many ways. Awesome! The only problem is you have to go home, eventually. Thanks Bruce, we always love staying at your place :)"

Bruce made the check in and out process super easy and he even met us on our way out to make sure everything went well.

Stayed with a pet","Had a great stay at Bruce's cabin. It is super cozy!
Bruce really puts a lot of effort into making this cabin a comfortable experience. There are so many things to enjoy here - from the fully stocked kitchen, sunporch with a beautiful view, fireplace, gas grill, campfire. All the details were taken care of. Even the outside campfire had wood in it, ready for use.
Just down the road (to the south) is the Cibola National forest, with a beautiful canyon hike.
There is only one issue that we had. This is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. I feel like I must mention this, to warn other travelers. The security on this cabin is very weak. There are at least 4 ground-level windows in the house that do not have any lock or locking mechanism.
Right next to the bed, there is a window with no lock. Anyone could very quietly slide that window open during the middle of the night.
It was really hard to sleep, knowing this. We woke up many times during the middle of the night.
I hope there will be a solution to this issue soon, for the safety of other travelers."

The cabin is very well kept and so comfortable, felt like Grandma’s :) The view was beautiful from every direction. We loved having a fire inside and outside, grilling in the mountains and eating in the sunroom with a wicked view of blue water lake. A lot to take in. The stars are breath taking at night and the silence is exactly what we needed for a perfect relaxing getaway. We’ll be going again very soon and staying longer! I agree with other reviews, this is our new favorite Airbnb. Great job Bruce!"

We got in late after a long day of driving on I-40. Cabin is easy to find and Bruce’s instructions are very easy to follow. It was snowing and quickly dropping in to the 20’s that night. Bruce already had the heat on for us and had even prebuilt the beginnings of a fire for us. The cabin is very clean and tidy plus, it really has everything you need. For me, it’s the small things - for starters, the fire. Furthermore, Bruce had stocked the fridge with the makings of breakfast for the morning just in case his guests don’t have provisions. Every amenity one could ask for, including games and books. We slept comfortably and warm, in the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the valley the cabin overlooks. It’s an excellent stop in a convenient location."

From the breakfast foods in the fridge, to the fireplace all set and ready to light. The cabin itself is a beautiful design, all hand made many years ago. The screened in porch provides sweeping views of the lake and the mountains in the distance. There are many spots to explore on his property if you like to hike around. If you’re looking for a quiet spot surrounded by natural beauty to disconnect from the chaos of your every day than this is the place for you. Our only regret is that we weren’t able to stay longer. My husband and I very much look forward to returning again soon."

The kitchen is stocked to be able to cook. Pans, crockpot, outdoor grill., basic spices.
We stopped to shop in Grants for food and that was all we had to add. Bruce has it all hooked up from fire pit to fire place.
Books, bed, shower essentials, space to lounge and room for the dog to run.
Cell service is there if you need it but if you want WiFi and TV, keep looking. That was what charmed us. Some disconnect.
And if you need any ends once you’re there, the drive to Thoreau is fast and the Dollar General/Family Dollar have stuff.

It has a desk space that would be great for remote work and everything you need if you need something more than just a night. Host was easy to communicate with and took time to help me with all of my questions. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Unfortunately we were unable to stay at Nicole’s place due to the train derailment on I40, but Nicole was the first to call and let me know of the issue. She volunteered to refund our stay if we wanted but if we still wanted to travel her way her husband gave us an alternate route or they were willing to meet us and we could follow them. After a rough decision we decided on the refund after looking at the back tracking we would have to do just to get to our next destination. Nicole was so nice about it, we would definitely try to stay at their place next time we travel through the area."

There was a toaster oven, hot plate, and more under there. I only needed one night, but this would be an excellent spot for anyone who needed to stay in this area for a longer period of time. It was easy to find and check in was easy.
One thing folks should know- This is a matter of personal preference of course: anyone who needs a firm mattress for comfort or pain management take note that the mattress was quite soft."

Since we arrived late on a Sunday night, we stopped in Gallup for dinner before heading to the studio as there were a few more food options available compared to Grants.
Their location was a also quick 15min drive to El Malpais National Monument too, very convenient!

Stayed one night","What an absolute gem off Route 66! We needed somewhere to stay while on our way cross country, and this was just perfect. We had our elderly dog and 3yo cat with us and it was so helpful that they allow not just dogs but also cats. After a long day of driving it was amazing to actually sit in the massive shower and just decompress. Even had snacks and coffee. Impeccably clean as well. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here a few days a week for 6 weeks and commuted to the clinic and hospital. It is about a 10-12 minute drive to the healthcare facilities. It is MUCH cheaper than the nearby hotels and in my opinion totally worth driving the extra 5 minutes. Pete and Nicole were amazing hosts. They were super accommodating and very communicative. I will definitely stay with them again if I am ever placed in Grants in the future. The place was very cute, has everything you need, and it’s kept really clean. I highly recommend staying here."

I was a little worried about not having a stove but there is an electric burner, lots of dishes, cooking stuff, etc. The studio is more roomy than I expected and the bathroom is also quite spacious. I am glad I booked this for my next 5 rotations and would recommend this Airbnb in a heartbeat."
