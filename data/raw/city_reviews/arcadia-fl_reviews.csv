Stayed a few nights","The host was so so kind, accommodating and very prompt with responses to questions or if we needed anything! The animals were so cute, and the location was so private and serene. The AC was on point, and it was very cozy. As long as you can handle the sulfur water, it's a perfect stay! Great for working in the area or a vacation to relax. I recommend watching the sunrise with some tea on the deck, and petting the animals! Also the decor was adorable inside."

Stayed a few nights","The garden camper was a nice stay. We loved the peaceful surroundings - waking up and saying good morning to the animals was lovely. The only con for me was the sulfury water, which can’t be helped, but made me hesitant to use the shower (I’m sure the smell would wear off!) However, the ac was cool and loud, comfortable bed and a good value. Angela was a friendly, responsive host and we appreciated her local recommendations. I would stay again if I came back to this area."

Stayed a few nights","Angela was great, her animals and farm are great. One neighboring family has occasional Sunday garden parties, just fyi. The A/C unit is fine but very loud, which was excellent for drowning out the neighbor's party. We had a minor electrical fault just as we were retiring at 10pm (which is late for a farmer) and Angela was immediately there to fix the issue."

I loved the animals! We arrived at night and it was pitch black. So when I went outside the first morning, what an awesome view! It sits on a little farm with sheep/goats, cows, chickens and ducks! It was pretty magical! I would definitely stay again. AC worked well too!"

Stayed a few nights","A pleasant surprise in Arcadia! At first glance, the idea of an apartment in the back of a huge garage might seem off-putting, but it turns out that it's an ingenious use of space. The living space that Macy has created in this this unconventional setting is delightful. Everything is well laid out and appointed, and the quality of the construction is top notch. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom is spacious and confortable.
The place can be a little hard to find, as Google maps takes you to the wrong address, but the AirBnB app locates it correctly. Also, one end of Provau Road is missing a stret sign, so it's easy to miss the turn, but once you locate the place it's easy to get to it from Hwy 17 by memory.
Macy's place is hands down the best accomodation I have had in Arcadia -- my mom and sister live there so I visit often, and usually stay in Port Charlotte or Punta Gorda, but hopefully Macy's place will be available for our next visit."

Stayed about a week","This was our first time staying at an Airbnb. We could not have asked for a more wonderful experience! Macy was so friendly with a warm welcome, a terrific smile and personality!
This place was exactly what we were looking for. We needed a place to call home for a week as we lost our home during hurricane Ian. The guest house was adorable! Loved the water, snacks and information of places to see and do. We will definitely plan to be back next year at Arcadia Rodeo time!
Thank you for the suggestion of Wheelers Cafe. We were starving when we got there and that was a perfect place to go . Please try it great menu and awesome food. Thank you again Macy for sharing your Shophouse!

Stayed a few nights","We had a nice stay at your place and it was in a beautiful spacious natural setting. The bed was comfortable and ample soft towels provided. The home had a lot of natural lighting from the windows and high ceilings with an open airy floor plan. Only personal issue I had was the house smelling like FeBreze when we first entered. I do not do well with perfume smells. But once I opened the windows it was all aired out in no time. Most probably would not even been bothered with this, but it was my only complaint. I still give the place 5 stars."

They were also accommodating when we had to add an extra day to our stay due to our flight schedule. We were welcomed with a variety of snacks and fresh eggs from their chickens and ducks. The cottage was super clean, with every amenity we needed. The kitchen was well equipped, the bathrooms came with toiletries, extra towels, and even makeup towels. The cottage is waterfront, and the grounds are very picturesque with all kinds of wild birds. Loved seating outside watching the birds, but my favorite activity was interacting with their goats. The goats were adorable and friendly. Meagan provided us treats to feed them and visited with us while we pet them. Loved the goats! We really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon!"

The cost of kayaking and fishing alone makes this well worth it, as you can do both for free right in the backyard without ever having to drive. The farm animals were awesome, the space had great AC and comfy beds. Will be back for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","The quaint cottage was just that. It was a nice weekend getaway from the city for us. Everything was really clean and nice inside the cottage. We came to the area to paddle board and kayak down to the Peace River to look for archaeological treasures. However, due to the recent hurricane the areas we tried to go to were very flooded. We still paddled around though. It was nice to get fresh eggs from the owners farm. We enjoyed seeing the ducks, chickens, and goats free roam around the property. Last night we made a small fire in the outside fire pit. It is very relaxing to sit outside and hear the sounds of nature like owls and cicadas."

The grounds were kept up nicely while we were there. We met Meagan one of the host and she was extremely pleasant. And even provided us with some firewood that we used to make s’mores one night with the kids. They have plenty of kayaks and paddle boards to use during the stay. I kayaked down to the river and back up the creek and it is a peaceful kayak. The location is perfect, and peaceful and only a short drive into town. There are some beautiful beaches just a short drive away, where you can find shark teeth and other fossils. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a relaxing vacation away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life."

Dave’s place was exactly as described. Very close to downtown shopping and the Mosiac arena. Directions were easy to follow and we found the location easily. The place was very quiet (concrete block between units) only noise we heard was from passing ambulance or fire truck (nothing anyone can control). Everything was clean and neat. The towels were plentiful and smelled really good and clean. Kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. Keurig coffee maker a plus if you want to bring your favorite pods, but Dave supplied more than enough and good quality. Also, tea choices and candy snacks were a “sweet” surprise. Dave gave good restaurant recommendation of el dorado maya which has great authentic Mexican food. Great price great portions. Be sure to visit the 2 best stores downtown, Cowboy Corner and right next door Blossoms. We will look forward to our next stay at Dave’s and visiting this adorable small town gem. God Bless❤️🇺🇸"

Stayed a few nights","A lovely little apartment. Everything was new, fresh, and modern. Kitchen was very well equipped with everything we needed, and more. The bed was comfortable and there was a nice walk-in closet. Dave was immediately responsive. It was also great to have a desk and internet as I had to work part of the time. Arcadia has good fast food options, a Walmart superstore, and everything we needed. (We preferred to eat in most of the time, so didn’t look into area restaurants.) We enjoyed the nearby golf course as well. There are 2 TVs including a large screen in the living room and one in the bedroom, although we didn’t have a chance to try them out: they were also new. Temperature control was good with a handheld thermostat. Overall, a very enjoyable visit."

And this one is just so beautiful, cozy and inviting, you feel right at home from the first moment. In retrospect, we were really sorry that we only stayed for one night (we had a meeting in Largo). We would have loved to stay for a few more days.

My wife and I felt that our kids were safe and that Kendall's home was well sanitized. The linens were very nice and bright white and the beds were very nice and comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer during our stay was amazing! The house had more than enough space and furniture to accommodate a family of four, but could just as easily have accommodated a family twice our size. Kendall was very easy to work with and was very responsive. It is nice to see a host that takes care of their property and goes above and beyond to make their guests feel welcomed.

My children enjoyed the animals and playing with their children. Both Natalie and Ramzi made us feel welcome and offered suggestions on places to eat and things to do with the kids. Will definitely keep them in mind next time we travel to Florida.

The camper is on their small farm, so it really reminded me of my childhood; listening to the roosters crow and the goose honk with excitement.
Her entire family is so friendly and welcoming. I was thankful to have some time away from work to visit with them while here.
I would definitely recommend staying here, it's quaint and comfortable."

From opening the gate to cutting firewood or getting us cookware, this was my favorite Air B&B stay I’ve ever had. It is truly a countryside paradise.

The coffee cake Kendall made us was probably the most delicious I've ever had- I'm absolutely sure its because she poured her heart into it. I hope to make this our escape! Thank you for hosting us. ❤️"

The bed in he master bedroom was so comfortable and we really enjoyed the large kitchen.
Outside we enjoyed bumping the volleyball with each other and wandering through the orange grove.
Oh, and the coffee cake was delish! If we are in the area we will definitely stay again. We had such a fun and relaxing time."

Stayed with kids","The hosts were very responsive and helpful at all times. We arrived late night so it was dark to get to but they left the outside and some inside lights on for us. Getting into the house was very easy, the parking spot is super close to the entrance. Once we made it inside, there was a nice handwritten note along with freshly baked coffee cake on the table for us. That was the cherry on top, what a sweet gesture! The house was very clean, they literally had everything we needed, they were very accommodating as well. In the morning we went out to walk around and see the area, a golden retriever came to us (from a neighbors house, I assume) and was so friendly! It was a great surprise.
Overall, the place was great, comfortable, peaceful and everything we needed for our stay. We definitely wish we could’ve stayed another night. Amazing hosts, thank you for being great and loving what you do!!!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at the Grovehouse! What a perfect spot in Arcadia. When we arrived, we were greeted with a warm cinnamon coffee cake on the kitchen table. It was delicious! The 2-story apartment/house gave us plenty of room to spread out. The upstairs area was perfect for our 2 teenage boys with twin beds, 2 sofas and a foosball table. (The stairs are steep and probably not suitable for small children.) Downstairs we enjoyed a very comfortable queen bed, beautiful kitchen, full size washer and dryer, and clean bathroom. It was very quiet and peaceful the entire time we were there. We enjoyed dinner at the outside table. Each morning a group of beautiful peahens would come through the property foraging for insects. We really had a great time and would stay here again next time we are in Arcadia!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my first time visiting Central Florida. Now I know where all of the Oranges and Beef comes from. There are miles of farm land in this area. The location in Arcadia is a little remote but did work for my visit with just a 40min drive to my weekend destination. The apartment was very clean and modern. Exactly as described and just like to photos. There is no TV...which at first I was not sure about but didn't effect my stay as I was able to catch up on much needed sleep in the peace and quiet of the surroundings and the super comfy queen size bed. There were way more amenities in the apartment than I needed for my short stay but I really appreciated the coffee bar and the nice home baked cinnamon coffee cake waiting for me when I checked in. Thanks Kendall, if I get back to this area again I will certainty try and stay at the Grove again."

We would’ve loved to relax and watch a movie. It was super convenient having a washer and dryer, everything was clean and the upstairs was fun with the games. The steps are a little shallow so be careful on those middle of the night bathroom runs but overall the place was great. We left a small BBQ for the next family to enjoy!"

I do wish I had brought a chair and umbrella in order to sit outside. There’s no where to really be outside other than in the ant infested yard. (No porch) Don’t forget to pack books and board games. I understood there was no tv before check in but there really isn’t anything for entertainment, so bring your own.
I would describe this place as a not-so-quiet country get away.
I would prefer being out that far in the country to be alone and not be sharing the building/ yard with other people. Or the feeling of being surrounded by people which this place very much has."

You will find water, fruits, oil, cheese, selection of sauces in the refrigerator and signature cinnamon pie on the table so if you arrived without visiting a store you will survive. The first floor is traditional with top quality of everything: from refrigerator-washer/dryer to lines and mattress. On the second floor you will find a sort of sophisticated country style design. Have you ever seen chandelier made from old spring mattress? :-) You will also find kids corner on the second floor and table football to play. The location is 1 h drive from beaches of crowded Sarasota and not very far from Orlando and other destinations in Central Florida. Perfect peaceful retreat both for businessman and family tired from big city."

Stayed a few nights","This is a cute and peaceful little place. We did cut our trip short due to the beds being too firm for us to sleep on. This was our first tiny house adventure and we ultimately decided we are not tiny home people. Kelli was a great host, extremely helpful & responsive. The property is beautiful and the stars are so bright in the night sky!! We also were able to build a nice fire in the fire pit. I also appreciated the sharp knife in the drawer, as most knives in airbnbs are very dull. Although we would not stay here again, we would definitely recommend it for tiny home lovers who are also okay with a firm bed and can climb a steep ladder (if you’re needing the upstairs beds) and get yourself down backwards. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute and quiet little place. Definitely a nice place to stay if you are looking to get out of the city and enjoy nature for a few days. The owner is very responsive and was helpful with everything and anything we needed. My daughter and i especially enjoyed all of her animals. We did visit with the goats and chickens and fed them. A few things to note:
1. The shower is located outside. I personally did not mind this, especially because we were enjoying a lot of nature activities so we were probably better off getting cleaned up out there. My daughter is quite bashful on the other hand, so she was a little nervous about it. It was little chilly too because of the cold front. There wasn't mention of the outside shower so i couldn't warn her of it before hand.
2. the upstairs beds are a little tough to get to, so i would say you need to be a bit agile if you intend on sleeping up there. I expected this so we had no issue."

She reacted really fast and was very communicative, helpful. Thanks to her and her cozy house we could spend a night in a wonderful and peaceful place which’s felt just like home. We arrived at night and we could find the house really easy. Self-check in, and privacy was really good. When we woke up and stepped out of the house we just saw that we’re surrounded with many animals like cows, goats, dogs, chicken. Even with a little lake in front of the house. Felt like that good place to be!
Thank you Kelli, we really enjoyed our stay.

We found joy in so many aspects of it; goats on 1 side and cows on the other. cute little pond in the front, we loved just sitting on the porch that morning that we were there. Also, a great sitting area on the cow side and an outdoor shower, fire pit, and a hammock on the goat side, lol. There was plenty of coffee grounds and sugar and creamer, even little snacks were left for us- which we really appreciated as we didn't get to this place until 4am because we just got MARRIED the night before. I definitely saved it in my maps! thank u again, Kelli!"

On the other hand, be careful: access to mezzanines is not easy (Meunier ladders with wheels)with very reduced ceiling height. We were however disappointed by the exteriors that did not correspond to the photos: almost empty pond and its surroundings seemed to be under construction. On the other hand, very beautiful view of the neighboring farm and its herd. As far as the animals we only saw 2 goats in a pen. Peaceful place."

Stayed one night","The most important part of staying at an Airbnb, for me at least, is privacy. Kelli's place gave me that 100%. I never saw anybody, only cows, goats and chickens. From her listed pictures, I was dying to get into that paddle boat as it was an extremely hot day. But the size of the pond was too small for a paddleboat. Easy check in. The tiny house was adorable and had everything I needed. The cold outdoor shower was perfect after a long hot day seeing the sights of Arcadia. There was a hot plate and a small fridge. I slept on the downstairs daybed because I couldn't make it up the ladder stairs to the upstairs beds. In town, I ate at the Yellow Deli which was perfect. I biked Morgan Park along the Peace River and then went out to Soloman's Castle for a 2 hour tour of the property. After checking out, I drove 1/2 hour to the Peace River Sculpture Gardens in Punta Gorda. Nice trip, nice private stay. Thanks Kelli!"

We slept really well in the country air. The only problem for us was the standard of cleaning, which we shared with Karen on arrival. I won’t list details here, it does not feel fair to do so. The kitchen lacked basic equipment- an oven tray for example and glasses. (There were jam jars instead.) Karen put most of this down to ‘being in the country’. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

But when we were at Karen's home, we absolutely LOVED it there. It was a beautiful home, just as described, and was in a beautiful country setting. There were very friendly dogs & cats living on the property, and It was so peaceful to sit out on the porch when we were there. It also had a beautiful pond in front of it. Next door was a horse & cattle ranch, and it was awesome to sit and watch them. It had everything we needed to feel just like we were at home relaxing!

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I were looking for a private, peaceful and out of the way place without the hustle of the city and full of crowds, and we found it in David and Karen's two-bedroom cottage. This place is a gem hidden in the countryside of Arcadia, away from the bustle yet close enough to get to Sarasota and surrounding areas without a problem. Surrounded by horses, enjoying morning coffee out on the porch, fresh air, great way to start your morning. The cottage is equipped with all the amenities you will need for a short, or an extended stay. The hosts live on the premises and the cottage is away from the main home, with lots of privacy. Although we did not have the pleasure of meeting Karen who was away while we were there, she was extremely responsive in communicating throughout the entire time we were there. Her husband David was on the premises and could not have been more helpful throughout our stay. If you are in this area, and want a peaceful, quite escape, this is the place."

There is a good sized Lilly pond with fish and benches. I enjoyed the swing too. The location was on the Fort Myers side of Arcadia - an easy drive. I would definitely stay here again.

We love the beautiful, natural surroundings. Some of our family enjoys fishing and most of us did a little kayaking and canoeing on the calm, peaceful river. This place appeals to our family members because we all live nearby so some are able to run home to tend to animals. We brought our own firewood and had great times sitting around the campfire at night telling stories, reconnecting, and roasting marshmallows."

It was clean and the rooms and bathrooms were nicely appointed. The thing I want to rave about is the property! It's right on a small river with kayaks, boats and canoes provided. Canoeing down the river was a magical experience! We hung out on the dock, enjoyed the wildlife and even had a campfire one night. So many memories made! :)"

Marc and Meagan were quick to respond to any questions we had and were more than willing to accommodate our special requests. Our family is already talking about coming back next year. This is an excellent place to have a family gathering, a church retreat, or a club event. We recommend it highly."

Group trip","A few friends and I booked this spot on a whim, looking for someplace close by to us where we could go and relax for a weekend and unwind. It looked like the perfect location on Airbnb, but the photos do not do it justice. We showed up in the late afternoon on Friday, and were greeted by Marc who gave us a quick tour and a little history of the property. The cabin has been recently remodeled and Marc and Meagan did a fantastic job! Everything was clean and comfortable, there was plenty of space for all of us to spread out and relax. The showers were hot, even after we all had showered after being in the river. The AC was cold, and each room had a fan and plenty of blankets to make everyone comfortable.
But the real thing that makes this place shine isn't the cabin, as great as it is, its the land and the river that the cabin is on. Marc and Meagan were happy to let us use the kayaks and paddle boards that they have, along with life jackets if we needed them. The property is on an offshoot of the Peace River, but its only a quick 5 minute kayak out to the peace river. You could easily bring a boat or your own paddle boards and have a great day out on the water! Marc and Meagan also set up a firepit right near the water, away from the other cabin that happened to have a family staying in it while we were there. The space around the pit had plenty of room for us to set up lawn games like cornhole and kanjam, and we were able to have fires both nights late into the night without having to worry. This was the perfect space for us to hang out and relax during our weekend! We will absolutely be coming back, and could not recommend this place enough! Marc and Meagan are perfect hosts, and even let us feed their goats while we were there! While we were there to hang out and relax, this space would be perfect for a family getaway, a reunion, or just a quick weekend on the water."

Stayed with a pet",We chose Stephanie's place because it was only a few short minutes from the venue where my son was getting married (King's Crossing Ranch) and the property looked so beautiful. The home and grounds were perfect but am so sad that we didn't really have time to enjoy the beautiful and peaceful surroundings because of our busy weekend festivities. My kids at least got to pick some of the fresh blueberries before we left and said the area down by the river was beautiful. We'd really love to return when we can just relax and take it all in. Stephanie was an amazing hostess and I really appreciated the kind note she left upon our arrival. We will be back!

We can't imagine a more lovely, peaceful and pleasant place to spent the winter months. The hosts and their families are literally the kindest, nicest, loveliest people you could ever dream of meeting. The property is absolutely stunning...we spent many a day out in the screened porch or down by the river. The kitchen is easy to cook in, the shower is wonderful, and the home is well laid out. It's close to Arcadia as well as Punta Gorda, Ft Meyers as well as close to Mayakka Park and many other amazing preserves and rivers.
If you are thinking of booking this place, just do it! You won't regret it!"
