As the listing described- the house was drafty and cold downstairs, but upstairs was very comfortable even on cold nights. The host was accommodating for our corgi that tagged along for the trip."

Stayed a few nights","First I would like thank you both.
The house was everything we expected. The property somewhat secluded or feels that way due to the beautiful landscaping. With that said if you arrive at night it feels a little uneasy as it’s dark and not a lot of surrounding light. In the morning you will enjoy the location and the surroundings as birds chirp and you hear the wind in the tall trees. We stayed due to attending DREAMVILLE. It’s 30/40 minutes from event location. My two kids 16&20 and myself had a blast.
Thank you"

Stayed a few nights","OK, so I had a special circumstance. First of all, and most importantly, the home is absolutely beautiful. They really went out of their way to make it a gorgeous space!
I went out there on my own to get away and have some rest and relaxation.
Unfortunately, I had to deal with a gas leak three days in a row. I am sure that this will be resolved now that I am gone, BUT I was told that the issue was known prior to my visit, by a maintenance man.
They were kind enough to give me $50 toward a meal one evening, but now our entire vacation budget is gone and there was a little to no relaxation.
It really was the extreme of good and bad. The home is perfect and I loved it. However, it was extremely expensive and I was unable to relax the entire time. If it was my home, I would not have charged the occupant based on the fact that The trip was completely affected by some thing that was my responsibility.
Once that is fixed, the home is perfect"

Stayed about a week","The home is beautifully appointed in a quiet, private location, and is a classic Tudor style home with many original stones, cast iron windows, and other antique finishes - yet has been completely modernized with new kitchen and bathrooms. There was a problem with the dishwasher, but Kevin & Tina were open and communicated with us to alleviate the issue, and we were satisfied with their response. Otherwise we had a fabulous stay there, and highly recommend this home if you are in the vicinity - Tobacco Road is right down the street! We will be back when we visit again."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful and peaceful location. The entry and house look exactly like the photos. The house is old and charming in all the right ways. It was very cold when we were there and despite the traditional windows we were still comfortable in the home. The location was ideal as it’s very close to the downtown Sanford restaurants. We were there for a memorial service and many of my family members had houses so far away that they chose not to come into town. We were able to get an Uber back to this house even.
There are a few quirks,ie bathroom doors that might not fully lock, tiny powder room downstairs, creaky floors but all of this adds to the charm and the modern amenities in the kitchen, and the spacious main bathroom with an amazing shower where more than adequate for us and our teenage daughters. We would definitely stay here again."

It was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the location was so peaceful. My family and I really enjoyed our stay and just wished we were able to stay longer if we could. This home was also pet friendly and it just felt like home. Everything was near by as well especially the park where we enjoyed our hike. We will definitely be back again soon."

Although the downstairs was quite chilly on the colder days, the decor and functionality of the home far outweighed the heat issue. We felt very comfortable staying here for an extended period of time. We were traveling with our small dog so the fenced in back yard was a plus!
Overall, great property!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was so adorable with well-appointed design, quiet and peaceful. An unfortunate incident, before we arrived, left the kitchen with a few items wanting (we sent owners notes about baking sheets, mixing bowls, items to bake in oven, hopefully replaced), the owners weren’t able to address the dishwasher not working issue while we were there for 2 weekend days (it wouldn’t latch in order to start). They did make amends for the inconveniences. We loved the location, overall the house and peaceful atmosphere."

My only heads up would be if you are a light sleeper as there can be road noise and the beautiful train runs all night. The bedroom is located in the back to help filter out and prevent as much noise as possible. The host is wonderful and did check to make sure everything went well and gave local recommendations."

The place has a cool urban feel and the bedroom is in a cave with no windows which is perfect for sleeping in. The place is clean with no clutter and we hope to stay a third time. Some outside noise while in the living area but nothing out of the ordinary in a downtown loft. Cool place and a great overnight place to stay with your pup.

The location is central to downtown with shops/restaurants but also peaceful and quiet. Some may be concerned about being above a restaurant/bar would be a problem for late night noise, but we didn't hear a thing. It was nice to have a kitchen, central air, and a washer and dryer, as well. Jeff was a wonderful host, answering our questions during the week in a prompt manner.

Very roomy space and located right downtown, walkable to lots of shops and restaurants. Even though it was a small town, with the windows and feel of the place, it felt like an urban loft. We came over a holiday weekend, and so it was quiet because no one else was in the other apartments and the restaurant downstairs was closed…so it was very quiet during our stay. Very spacious and we loved the bedroom with no one windows, so we slept well. Hope to stay here again."

Very clean when we came and Jeff was very quick to answer when I had questions. If you choose to stay here be aware it’s in a bit of a city so I saw maybe a critter or two but nothing that would warrant caution about cleanliness. There’s a bar downstairs so it makes sense. Such a great spot! Only minor downside is how thin the walls were so you could very clearly hear the people in the apartment next door. All in all I was very happy with the place!

Stayed a few nights","Another amazing stay. This is our 3rd time here. As always the place is extremely clean and communicating with the owners is very ease. we love the views and the place. So peaceful.
What takes this place over the top of every other place we have stayed is the owners. I'm not sure too many owners would have done what they did this weekend. We checked in at 4:30 and the A/C wasn't working. I messaged the owner and in 45 minutes both the owner and their A/C guy was there. They determined the unit needed replaced and they would have the unit replaced in the morning. We were comfortable staying there because the sun was going down and it was cooling off. By 1030am the next morning a brand new unit was installed and we weren't inconvenienced at all. our next 3 days were nice and cool. They were very accommodating and professional. I highly recommend staying here as I'm not sure all owners would have handled this issue this way."

Some things you should know:
- It is rather secluded. You enter through a long private drive which can be a little eerie if coming in late at night.
- It was recently remodeled/decorated and they didn't skimp, it looks nice.
- The living area was a little small, but the walk out porch made up for it.
- Ample parking and very few neighbors
- Its definitely quiet but you do have some noisy neighbors (frogs)"

One reviewer says it was “jaw dropping” and I absolutely agree. My family are Sanford locals and they were impressed. Their first words upon entry: “mmmm smells like the beach!”. Heidi definitely cut no corners in this apartment and we had everything we needed and more! Water and sodas in the fridge, snacks on the table, coffee pods ready to go! Plenty of clean linens and towels. Comfy couch and BIG TV! We brought our golden doodle and she got a warm welcome too AND she loved it as well! I wish we were staying longer because it was hard to say goodbye to this amazing space! We definitely are coming back to stay with Heidi ❤️ THANK YOU HEIDI!"

She made us and our dog feel right at home. It is a great space just as described except she has separated the two yards with a fence with a gate so your dog can have its own private space to run around. We look forward to returning again!

Stayed a few nights","Heidi’s place is located in a quaint surrounding and nice ambience. The accommodations were very clean. She provided some snacks, coffee, and the mini fridge had several beverages. 😊 Although there was no stove, a griddle was more than sufficient. I was able to cook bacon, eggs, toast and pancakes for breakfast as well as some chicken for lunch/dinner. I worked remotely from the dining area and sometimes from the living room. My favorite thing were the window coverings. My least (even though it smelled good) was the automatic air freshener in the bathroom that startled me a couple of times and made weird sounds like if it talked. 😂 Other than that, my stay was most enjoyable and Heidi is a GREAT host!!! Very responsive and attentive. Oh, did I mention she also brought me some goodies two out of the five nights of my stay. Thank you!!!"

The bedrooms are quite large and spacious. There is a microwave and toaster oven to do some light cooking.
Best of all is the host, Heidi. She's easy to talk to and makes her guests feel cared for and attended to.
Really appreciated the welcome basket and coffee!!! I recommend this airbnb and will definitely consider staying again next trip. Thank you Heidi!"

Stayed a few nights","Heidi,
We had such a delightful time staying in your beautiful home and neighborhood. The lower level apartment offered us lots of light, many amenities such as comfortable beds, plenty of towels, comforts such as coffee and snacks, the mini fridge and toaster over even came in handy. We appreciated the sitting room with TV and especially loved the back yard where we could sit and watch the deer, squirrels and birds wake up with the day while we did the same. And the fireflies at night were magical as well.
Staying with you, so close to the family members we were visiting, took our vacation in Sanford to a whole other level of peace and tranquility. Our evening visit with you and Maddie on your back deck was possibly our favorite part! Getting to know you some was lovely. We wish you all the best in your life endeavors. You are a generous and kind person. We suggest that you not change a thing because it was perfect!
Your airbnb gets an A++++ from us! As it was our first airbnb experience, now all others in the future will have to measure up to you! That will no be easy. Again, we thank you sincerely.
-Kristin and Paul, Corvallis, OR"

You can't tell from the photos but the host's main house is a couple hundred feet away and the airbnb is fairly close to the road so you will hear cars. I live in the woods and am used to a quiet, secluded environment, but if you don't mind those things, this is definitely worth booking! The farm was beautiful and clearly well cared for and the host also included a variety of snacks and things like cotton balls and q-tips in the bathroom."

The property itself was a picturesque haven, boasting modern amenities. The cozy cottage exuded warmth and character and was tastefully decorated. One of the highlights of my stay was waking up to the sight of their beautiful farm and chickens.
The host, Cindy, deserves special commendation for her hospitality. From the moment of booking until the day of departure, she went above and to ensure a seamless experience. Her attention to detail was evident in every aspect of the stay, from the impeccably clean accommodations to the thoughtful touches like coffee, tea and snacks.

Stayed a few nights","First time using Airbnb and booking a listing for my first trip in a long time. Had an absolute fantastic time away from life on my vacation. The house was beautiful both on the inside and out. Very easy to find (however the ""5"" from the ""54"" on the mail box was missing when I got down there but luckily I was able to see the outline of the house number. Not only was the place wonderful but later that day when I got back after grabbing some dinner with my friend I was visiting in the area we were greated by this very friendly neighborhood cat. She was the sweetest lil thing and I saw her multiple times up to the last night of my stay. Not sure if it was a neighborhood cat or one of the neighbors but boy do I wish I could've taken it home. Overall, if I happen to visit my friend in the area again in the future I will more than likely book this listing again. 5 stars all around. Thank you Lucy :)"

Group trip","The house was very pretty, in a quiet neighborhood, very peaceful, within walking distance of a grocery store and a dollar tree. It was quite possibly the perfect place to have Christmas away from home.
The only down falls were the internet and communication. The internet was awful, two people could not be on a lap top at the same time without delays or glitches. Not sure if that’s just how it is in that area, or there was a possible problem with the internet itself. Communication was also very minimal, I only had to reach out twice, once about a burned out light on the front porch, which was no big deal, we honestly thought we flipping the wrong switches. The other time was to ask about the garbage, specifically the recycling, we didn’t know what got recycled, or what the rules were, we did reach out in the morning on Christmas Eve, definitely had grace with waiting for a response, holidays and families are important, but alas, we never got an answer. We would stay there again."

We are very thankful for this place. We celebrated my husbands 22 year retirement from the Army and it was the perfect place for it!

I didn't use the kitchen except to make some coffee and spend a little time on my laptop, but I noticed that it's fully equipped. I felt right at home.
Emalee and Laurie respond quickly to inquiries and are great hosts.
If you're so inclined, it's a short walk (a few blocks) to the Sanford downtown area, with locally-owned (and good) restaurants, brewpubs, coffee shops, bakeries, and stores. If you drive to the downtown area, there's plenty of free street parking.
Five stars and two thumbs up."

There is no night stand on one side of the bed.
Trying to watch TV in the bedroom with a canopy pole in your line of vision is impossible.
My spouse and I wanted to sit and have coffee together. There is no place to sit except the kitchen table. One recliner is okay for a solo traveler. But this listing is for 2 people.
The only place we could sit together was in bed.
There are also no blinds in the kitchen or front door so anybody can look in.

The kitchen was very well equipped (minus a toaster) and everything worked great! Some things to note, the laundry is a little bit of a walk to get to since you have to go outside and around the house and the WiFi was a bit iffy for me, especially during storms, and it didn’t reach every part of the apartment.

Stayed one night","The pictures do not do this flat justice. Charming and spacious, this home is in a perfect spot. Emalee was very attentive to my needs especially in the middle of the night when a malfunctioning smoke detector (no fault to anyone) decided it wanted to go off. There attention to safety is key as they have numerous smoke detectors throughout which shows the level of care they have for their guests. The only downside is that I wish I had time to stay for two nights as this home begs for you to sit back, relax and explore the downtown at a leisurely pace."

Stayed a few nights","The owners did a great job of communicating, and the apartment was nicely decorated. The place had been cleaned, but the sheets had small stains on them and there was a large roach in the kitchen. We do not think the roach was a result of being unclean; we recognize roaches are common in the South no matter how clean a place is. We asked the owners if we could get a refund for the second night of our stay (we booked two nights) and we were told that it wasn’t possible due to Air BnB’s cancellation policy. We understand the charge on the credit card could not be reversed, but we felt they could have been more accommodating to our request, since there are other ways to reimburse someone or give a discount. Paying full price for a place that has the largest roach I have ever seen was not ideal. They did offer to spray if it would help us feel better."

Close to quaint downtown with decent places to eat. About 40 minutes or so to Raleigh. Our first night was very quiet but the second night there were others staying in the separated unit below and we could hear them. Some windows in the main areas don’t have window treatments...so a bathrobe is helpful! Over all very nice place and would recommend it to others.

It comes with the kinds of thoughtful touches a guest would expect from a five-star hotel, and with a host who genuinely cares about the guest's experience. my stay here was fantastic and I would definitely come back."

Group trip","Very nice rental apartment/home. It is essentially half (the left side) of a duplex home. Nicely furnished and clean, no issues with check-in at all. Very good working AC & wifi which is a plus.
We did wish a unit touted as a 'botanist bungalow' had some more thoughtful touches in the outdoor space, which seemed sparsely planted and not well kept.. maybe they'll get back there this summer and do some more landscaping because I think it would make the place look much more appealing.
All in all, it was still very convenient to stay in Carolina Trace where we were celebrating with our friends for the weekend, and the home was quite adequate for the price. Much appreciated!"

Stayed a few nights","this is my 1st time renting an Airbnb. we were blessed to have found Catie. cute bungalow very comfortable for all 3 of us. love it had 2 king size beds. my 83 yr old mom said the place was so peaceful and i totally agree with her. bedding very comfortable and i am very picky with my bedding.
we felt secured and safe. Ms. Catie was very patient and willing to answer any and all of my questions no matter how silly they were, and she was willing to come over and help with whatever we needed. i basically felt like i was treated like a family member. oh, she also had the bungalow decorated with Christmas touches which made it even more special.
the only thing we struggled with was driving at night because there are no streetlights, but that has nothing to do with Ms. Catie, just giving you a heads up if you are not accustomed to driving in the dark
i will definitely plan to stay at this Airbnb in the future. thank you Catie for your hospitality."

Stayed with a pet","The community is peaceful and we enjoyed walking down to the lake and playground with our dogs and 1.5 year old. The pictures don’t really show it but there is plenty of space off to the side of the house to take a pup out.
This is probably one of the best thought through air BNBs we have stay at GLOBALLY. You can tell there was so much effort and intention put into items for us. Since we were coming from not too far away I brought coffee cream and cooking oil because air BNBs don’t usually have them. They were both provided already! There were cold drinks in the fridge and some snacks on the entry table. There were even dog poop bags and a few dog toys and bowls. Things that you sometimes don’t think to bring with you but are such a nice to have!
There wasn’t a lot of baby proofing needed either as there wasn’t any clutter and thoughtful furniture.
Catie checked on us after the first night to see if we needed anything. We would 10/10 stay here again!!"

Ok, I know this is about to sound like a paid advertisement, but it's not. I just feel extremely motivated to tell it like it is. This place is absolutely private and fantastic. So clean. The little touches that make it home are incredible. Everything we needed to make a cup of awesome coffee in the morning - they have that covered. There were even snacks and waters and sodas! She set out a bottle of wine! So warming and thoughtful. The beds were like sleeping in a 5 star hotel. We sunk in and had the best most quiet sleep we have had in so long! We never sleep in past 6 am - and we didn't wake up until 8:30!!! The woods surrounding the property are so lovely and it was so quiet - the birds, crickets and frogs sung us to sleep. Whether you are sitting in the seating area of the front porch garden or on the backyard deck, it is just delightful. Whether you are going to Carolina Trace for some golf or just to get away to a quiet lovely place for a few days - this is your best bet - don't even think about it, just go. You will be at peace and happy."

The deck looks out on a peaceful forest scene, a great place to enjoy your morning coffee. The beds are super comfortable, the towels are fluffy, and I love having a full washer and dryer available if needed.
We had fun playing board games and listening to albums last evening. The desk by the front window was perfect as I had work to finish up and I loved the peaceful view out the window while I worked.
The kitchen has everything you need to make meals, brew a great cup of coffee, or fill up your water bottle with ice and water from the fridge dispenser as you head out the door.

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting for a workshop at Sanford Palette & Brush Club and the house was perfect for my friend and me. Spacious! Neighborhood looks a little run down but the neighbors were delightful. This home is old so squeaky floor here and there but that was nothing compared to the nice, well done rooms& beds. Great beds and so clean! Love the bedding, shower and kitchen. The dining room was set with place mats which was inviting. A great space to work at night. We felt very safe and enjoyed our stay! Thank you Liv & Sky. If we are fortunate enough to return tomorrow, Workshops, we will definitely reserve your home again."

It was only 10 minutes away from almost everything; the Civic Center, Walmart, Biscuitville (my first time and loved it), you name it..! As for the home itself it was very spacious and accommodated my family very well. I would like to give a special mention to Skylar who went Above and Beyond to help me find a taxi service for an early morning trip, but aside from that she was Extremely responsive! That’s really important to me when I have such a responsive host, so thank you Skylar!!"

Access to Disney plus and all things internet was super awesome (we don’t have that luxury at home)!
Skylar was quickly responsive even prior to our stay! The pack n play was available for use and a baby gate which was also appreciated!
The location is just about 5-10 minutes to anything if you needed it- groceries, playgrounds, dollar store, restaurants… you name it, the location is prime.
Would consider staying here again if we are ever in the area again."

The kitchen has most everything you would need. I am not from the area (my family is) but I wouldn’t feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood at night as some parts to one side seemed a bit..run down? for lack of better words. Although to the other side is much nicer. According to my family, that is how Sanford is. A small and older town. I would still stay again. Part of the charm. I used the Airbnb for a “home base” for my parents to watch my kiddo during day while I visited a family member in the hospital. He had so much space to play and they even left toys! The price was great and the Airbnb absolutely beats the local hotels in amenities and cleanliness. I would also just like to say again, the beds are amazing. Better than mine at home, lol!"

Stayed a few nights","Sherri, your host, will do everything in her ability to make your stay in Sanford as delightful as possible. Sherri helped find treatment for one of our friends with a knee injury, which allowed my friend to stay and enjoy her time in Sanford.
Sherri has prepared a very comfortable house with very comfortable beds and plenty of room to step away from others in the house and rest. The kitchen has plenty of cooking and dining elements so you’re able to prepare simple meals or bring in your takeout and enjoy your meal. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood just minutes from Sanford’s town center. Parking is easy with virtually no traffic to contend with. Everything was very clean, organized, and in great condition. A very lovely home!
This house is likely to be booked frequently, so if you’re wondering about whether to jump on this location as your refuge from a bustling day, don’t hesitate. You’ll be delighted you did.
And if you speak with Sherri, tell her ‘hello’ from me!"

Stayed with kids","The place was absolutely marvelous. It was easy to find, easy to check in and was well kept. I would have given this place 5 stars, if it had not been for an allergic reaction I had to some sort of freshener. I am better, but I did not enjoy the visit with my family as much because the allergy was quite challenging. If you have no allergies to fragrances, you will absolutely love it!"

Stayed a few nights","First off communicating with Sherri was a pleasure. She was very clear on what the property had to offer and was helpful along the way. When we arrived to the property, my mouth drop opening the front door. It’s gorgeous in person! The living room was cozy. The kitchen/dining was immaculate. High ceilings and spacious. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday. I highly recommend staying here.
PS if you are looking for a nice master bed room, it’s here!"

Stayed a few nights","Sheri’s house was fantastic. It was super clean and the beds were comfy. We forgot to bring soap, but there was some great soap in the bathroom (I bought some for Christmas gifts). We loved the snacks, there was plenty of seating in the living room (the couch was comfy), the front porch swing was nice, the towels were great (happy that there were also washcloths), the iron came in handy. This AirBnB was the best! No detail was missed."

Stayed with kids","The house was beautiful, clean, and beautifully decorated. It had more than enough space to commadate six adults, one child, a toddler, and an infant. The yard was a nice size for the kids to play. Loved sitting on the swing on the large front porch and enjoyed hanging on the back deck. I was in town for four days for my son's wedding and needed a house that was
convenient to my sons house & wedding venue. Everything was perfect.
Sherri was a pleasure to work with. Always quick to get back to me with questions I had. Easy access to get into the house. I will rent again when I come back to visit my son. I
recommend renting this house if you have high standards. You will not be disappointed.
Sherri, thank you for a wonderful stay.
