Stayed with kids","The house is so cute, pictures do not do it justice! It comfortably fit 2 adults and 5 kids ages 5,6,11,13 and 15. The area has a nice peaceful country feel, and was quiet. The yard is huge and the kids enjoyed playing outside. The small town of Glendale is perfect for antique shopping. Glendale antique mall and green top antiques have the nicest shops. Michael was very responsive any time I needed to text him. We definitely would love to stay here again."

Stayed with kids",Michael’s house was prefect for what we needed. Such a cute house that is convenient to all needs and just minutes from my family. Michael was super quick with responding to questions we had. Handy 24 hour gas station just second down the street also. The house was everything we needed. The only suggestion I would give for the house is to maybe have bunk beds in the bedrooms downstairs so kids can bunk up but definitely not something necessary. We will definitely be staying at this house again when we visit family.

Stayed one night","Newly upgraded duplex in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Modern electronic door locks provide easy access to a clean, well appointed interior. Unique decor consisting of a bear theme throughout is clever and tastefully done. There are even bears on the ceiling fan pulls! Floor, walls, switches, outlets, appliances and bathroom fixtures along with most furniture appear brand new. The existing woodwork is original (and older) but freshly painted.
Easy off-street parking in a long paved driveway in front of a two car garage. Spacious yard with a large deck complete with a Weber gas grill and plenty of comfortable seating is shared with the other unit though we only saw that person for a brief moment. One TV hanging on the wall in the living room but we didn't switch it on nor did we use the WiFi. Two bedrooms are set up identically with 1 queen bed each and plenty of closet space but no dressers. One hallway bath with a tub shower is shared by the two bedrooms. Ryan is a great guy who showed a little after our arrival to cut and trim the grass. He chatted with us for a spell before taking on his task. If in Elizabethtown, stay here. You will not be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic AirBNB, best in Etown. The bathroom and appliances are all upgraded, most everything was new and tied together with a cohesive interior design bear theme. Modern back porch. The downstairs laundry and exercise room was very clean, as well as the whole unit. Motion activated touchless trashcan felt sanitary. Overall, the unit was very clean and there was a HEPA air filter. While the memory foam beds were softer than I’m use to, I ended up sleeping very well and looked forward to getting a good nights rest. High tech dimmer switches and outlets with USB switches were really cool. Blazing fast internet. No disruptive noise from the other duplex unit late at night.
Minor downsides: hazy plastic cups and shopping bag used as bathroom trash bag.
Overall, highly recommended"

The Love sac and couch were incredibly comfortable and so were the beds. I adored the Sherpa comforters. It was like sleeping in a cloud. Also, the bear art around the house themed to WWII was a unique touch and very welcomed. That LED light above the couch is a very nice touch!

The unit has beautiful character and I’m anxious to come and see future things he will add.
The air purifier was an added bonus that I appreciated.
I will be back!"

Close to I65, we stayed there as a middle stop on a trip to FL and it was a very quiet and relaxing spot to crash for the night. Ryan is super prompt with communication. The home is a few houses up from a busy street, but there’s plenty of room in the shared yard and deck space. Overall would highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Cute place, perfect for what we needed. It was very close to the highway/town yet it felt secluded.
I do wish that I had realized that the property right next to it was also an Airbnb. They are located very close to each other and we could hear the neighbors talking/music even though they weren't being extra loud. Other than that, a few areas could use a deep cleaning. A few drawers were dirty on the inside, the freezer could be wiped out, and we had to wash every dish we used.
Overall, nothing major and I would stay here again, but wanted to point out a few things that could be improved."

Stayed a few nights",We checked in at the cabin and walked in and it was a beautiful clean modern space with a nice kitchen everything that we wanted TV cable couches a nice kitchen a nice bed nice place to sit outside and enjoy nature in a real looking Log Cabin setting. The cabin was very close to all the distilleries we wanted to visit and there were several good restaurants in the small towns we were near. We had a small small issue with a circuit breaker that blew and so I called up the landlord and she told me exactly how to fix it and it was no problem. Places really clean modern bathrooms even had a foosball and a Pac-Man game. It was very relaxing very fun we hope to come back soon. If you're in the Elizabethtown or The Bourbon Trail area you should book this place great for two people. Wonderful

Stayed a few nights","  This was our first time ever staying at an Airbnb and Tracey was absolutely amazing. She answered all our questions and was absolutely tremendous.
  Her cabin is an absolute delight. It is hard to believe that her cute little cabin is so close to the city and yet it is so quiet and peaceful. Also the area is absolutely beautiful with the leaves starting to change. It rained a bit while we were there and it was so relaxing. We came to Kentucky for a wedding but we could never have expected such comfortable and enjoyable accommodations. 
  I would also highly recommend this for a nice couples’ quiet getaway: away from the busy day-to-day life.
  Whatever your Airbnb needs, this cabin is perfect for a quiet and romantic adventure or just a safe and quiet place to sleep while you spend your days exploring the area."

She was helpful and the place was updated super clean with all the extras (a lot of Airbnbs dont have). Like detergent, paper towels, she even had snacks out. Outside was well maintained, landscaping looked great and the Hammock was a really nice added bonus. There is even a PacMan machine in the house. She is awesome and it is a direct reflection on how she maintains her property inside and out!!! Every time I come back to the area I will check to see if this Airbnb is available before I look anywhere else."

Stayed a few nights","Super easy check in and very peaceful surroundings.
We loved the hammock and fire pit. It was just far enough off the main road for it to be extremely peaceful.
The bed is extremely firm, so if you’re used to a softer bed, consider bringing a topper.
There are not many spices/ things to cook with (such as pan spray or a lighter for the fire outside.) We did have to purchase seasonings and sugar.
The place was overall clean, but when walking around, our feet turned black and needed a good scrubbing.
It really felt like home with the amount of towels and the setup of the bathroom with the washing machine and dryer.
I will definitely be staying here again when I come to visit my bf who is stationed at Fort Knox."

Stayed one night","I loved everything about this one night stay, except the actual sleeping part. The bathroom was spotless; I have never seen a cleaner shower/tub area! Sparkling white. The studio apartment seemed like a cute little remodeled garage, and had everything one would need for an overnight stay, even a laundry washer/dryer. Very trendy!
The only negative is the sleeping area. The bed is placed just inches away from the air/heater, which is the hotel-style which is pretty much level on the wall with your face. The mattress was stiff and felt very clinical. Add to this the sheets weren't cozy, but instead that odd plastic-y light fabric that slides all over the place and doesn't stay in place. I used the throw blanket from the couch for cozy warmth, and in the middle of the night I ended up unplugging the heater to prevent it from blowing loudly in my face. My husband gave up on the bed and slept on the couch with no blankets. We both had a very restless and uncomfortable night."

Owners communicated to us ahead of time exactly how to get there and gave us the code. Extremely easy to checkin in. We parked right outside the door. The Airbnb is one room except for the bathroom, but it just made it easy to watch tv from the couch or the bed. My husband enjoyed the Pac-Man game. Everything felt new, clean, homey, and we enjoyed the snacks and bottled water. We had a wonderful stay! Highly recommend this place!"

The bed was comfortable shower was hot and even had some snacks and water waiting for us. Had fun playing pac man and enjoyed relaxing outside.

The neighborhood is quiet and provided a great restful place for us in between games and at the end of the day. We were about 10 minutes or so from the park, from downtown, and from other restaurant and commercial areas.
The place was spotless, with comfortable beds and a sectional couch. All the technology, including the keyless entry, worked perfectly, and Ryan provided clear and easy instructions for all of them before our arrival.
No doubt in my mind we will book this place again when we return next year."

Ryan’s Elizabethtown properties have surpassed our expectations. The space is generous, offering ample room and beds for just the two of us.

Ryan’s property was a standout, offering excellent value and pristine conditions. We appreciated the flexibility to extend our stay and the chance to reside in another of Ryan’s well-kept properties, despite the high demand.
The decision to explore NW Kentucky due to my husband's job at @the Blue Oval was greatly enhanced by the comfort & security of Ryan’s accommodations. The meticulous attn to cleanliness & details along with w/the provision of top-tier amenities made our stay particularly enjoyable. Feeling like we won the KY Airbnb lottery 😉🙃🌟in Elizabethtown.

It felt like home away from home, with a spacious backyard for the boys to throw the ball around. Kitchen had plenty of utensils and cookware, living room and couch were comfy for movies at night, and the heated bathroom floor was amazing!

A few things to let other travelers know:
1-there isn't a walkway down to the entrance, but the grass was well maintained, so it wasn't difficult to get to.
2-if you sleep in the main room, there is a small device on ceiling that will light up throughout night (I believe it's for the internet). It didn't bother us, but I know some people may need pitch black to sleep."

It is comfortable and quiet, in a very safe neighborhood, one of the best in the area. I was able to run out for a quick supper at a local place, there are tons of options within a couple of minutes.
The space features a well furnished small kitchen that most any meal could be prepared in. The bathroom was more than adequate.
We found the space to be immaculately clean.
The private entrance is in the rear of the residence, accessed from about a 50' walk through the lawn, down a small slope, there is a nice view of the back yard from the bedroom.
Three nicely furnished beds are available. No complaint there.
Ryan as a host is excellent. He was super responsive and helpful.
This space is another example of why this industry is so successful. The stay is as much fun as the trip. Great job Ryan."

We had a long drive down from Ontario & Ryan was so accommodating with our late arrival (even offered to pick up food we may need & took a look at our truck's wiper that wasn't working). The fire on this cold Southern night topped of a great stay. We now know where to book when we travel through the area again ... Elizabethtown is a great destination, very close to the I 65 too!

This home is one of the gems that are located in a lovely neighborhood just outside of everything.
We stayed for a football tournament and it took us approximately 11 to 13 minutes to be at the field daily depending on the traffic.
The home is clean and full of light. The beds are comfortable and the sheets are 5 star worthy! They spared no expenses when it comes to technology. From the television remote to the bathroom mirror, and the push button lights, the kids were intrigued. The fireplace was an added bonus as were the usb charging ports.
Ryan is the kind of host that you wish all hosts were. From timely responses to accommodating needs, Ryan was the full package."

Stayed a few nights","The location was great and the rental was well furnished. The hosts were responsive and accommodating. The only negative feedback is there is no lighting or walk way to the rental which makes it easy to slip or trip on the grass leading to the property, especially at night. Also, I know we were in someone's home but we kept being woken up from stomping and furniture moving around early in the morning. We are on vacation from California so being woken up at 7 is like 4 a.m. for us. It was a nice stay but could have been better."

He checks in to make sure we have everything we need and even provided us a nice big bag of ice for our cooler because he knew we would be back and forth to the fields. There are three very comfortable beds and a great cozy couch to watch your favorite shows. WiFi was excellent as well. I would recommend to anyone.

I also note that we stayed here for a basketball tournament in Louisville. Last year we stayed in downtown Louisville, and this year we wanted to find a location a little further out and with lots of character. We found it!!! The commute to Louisville was only about 40 minutes and super easy (straight shot).
I highly recommend this unit!"

Stayed one night","Just being honest, I live in this town. My husband and I decided to rent this as a last min date night-for a change of scenery, chance to hang out down town, walk around and without the drive home;-)
If you aren't a local. Let me tell you. Around the square is definitely the best area! There are lots of neat shops, great restaurants, a bar (Even a speak easy bar - SO neat!). All is within walking distance ( Only a 2 min walk to all of that!!!)
We were off the main road, which is what we wanted, but still right in the middle of it all! There is a neat balcony we enjoyed doing some people watching on while still being down a quiet side street ;-)
This place was extremely clean, beautifully decorated and well stocked! With my experience with Airbnb's I definitely took note of the full size shampoo and conditioner. That was a major plus in my eyes!
If you are from out of town? Take my advice from a local...This is a great area of town, it's clean and it's beautiful. It's a win!"

Beautiful hardwood floors, nice linens, good lighting— and even had a washer and dryer. We were there over the holidays visiting family and I cooked multiple meals to take to friends’ gatherings (and the kitchen had everything I needed!). Every morning we’d grab coffee at the downstairs coffee shop and, in the evening, we walked to dinner at one of the nearby restaurants (which were both excellent). And, if we wanted an evening cocktail, we were right across the street from a fantastic bourbon bar. Definitely one of our favorite air bnb spots and we hope to return!"

There were some issues with the lock initially, but that was ONLY because the area had wind damage, and power was out. However, the hosts quickly responded to the issue, and we resolved it.
We highly recommend this Airbnb for location, cleanliness, amenities and quick response from the hosts."

Stayed a few nights","Loved the space and the location. Plenty of good walking options for dining-in or carry- out. The loft was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. A stay is no good in my estimation if at the end of a long day the bed and bedding is not up to snuff. No disappointment on that end , with comfy pillows and coverlet. The outdoor seating area out a set of doors off the lviing room led to a spacious porch, which provided a nice spot to sit, enjoy the sun and take in the surrounding downtown historic district. We were amazed at all the quaint shops, as well as coffee shop, which was right next door. The loft was super quiet and the HVAC system worked like a dream with an easy to use dial setting. The kitchen was stocked with every amenitiy once could think of. The owners even had a bag of ice for our use and chilled beer mugs in the freezer. We were especially happy to find a set of high end Samsung washer/dryer combo with detergent provided. The beautifully tiled shower had luxurious soaps, etc. and the water pressure in the shower and sink were excellent. Todd & Tyler were very easy to communicate with and provided every detail necessary to find the loft, as well as how to check-in seamlessly. My husband and I have friends in the area and plan to visit again in the future. We would definitely book another stay."

Stayed one night","We stayed here over Easter weekend and can't wait to book again! I grew up in Etown and my family still lives there. I decided to see what Airbnb had to offer in Etown for a last minute visit (assuming I wouldn't find much) and I was shocked that this beautiful loft was downtown. The downtown area is now bustling with shops and restaurants and it was just the little weekend gateway we needed! Todd & Tyler reached out SO quickly with confirmation and details on the stay (and I booked the morning of)! The loft has high ceilings and exposed brick throughout, with a full kitchen, bath and large bedroom. My favorite part was the walk out balcony, perfect for morning coffee. The walkability was something I also really loved. We never moved the car once we got there. We walked down to Flywheel Brewing Saturday afternoon, then walked to JR Neighbors that night and to Bourbon Barrel Tavern for a drink after. The loft also sits on top of Vibe Coffee, a great local coffee shop that also has food. If you're looking to visit Etown for even just one night, I can't imagine a better place to stay! We're already planning our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Perfect stay at Todd & Tyler's historic loft with modern updates. The location is ideal, right off the central circle in Elizabethtown's quaint downtown area where there are numerous restaurants, bars, and shops to enjoy (we particularly loved J.R. Neighbors). The loft sits above a wonderful coffee shop, which makes for a little bit of noise starting in the morning but nothing bothersome by any means -- we kind of liked the dull hum of activity coming from below. Parking was easy, check-in and check-out were made very simple, and the communication from Todd & Tyler was perfect (thorough without being overwhelming). The loft, itself, is beautiful, open, and well-stocked with all the primary amenities you could need. Great living area and kitchen, comfortable bed, modern bathroom -- checked every box we were hoping for and matched exactly the description in the listing, and did so in style.
If you're visiting the Bourbon Trail, in town for a soccer tournament, or just passing through the area, I would highly recommend Todd & Tyler's loft over nearby hotels or other available accommodations. We will absolutely look to stay there again next time we're in Elizabethtown."

Stayed one night","Clean, stylish, and comfortable! We were so grateful to spend the night at Todd & Tyler's space on our way through town. And while we didn't stay more than a night, we could definitely see returning to explore the town.
The space was delightfully clean, and filled with fun little amenities. The perfect loft to stay in as a couple or with a couple of friends. It's all set for a card night with drinks, or a relaxing little getaway.
Todd was quick to respond, very helpful, and a great host!"

We loved every minute of our stay and really appreciated the rustic, quaint feel that went well with the overall ""vibe"" of E-town. So many little shops to check out and enjoy and you must stop into Vibe, Impellizaris, and the Dreamery while you are there."

Walking in is refreshing, as everything was neatly placed and very clean! I loved the KY themed decor and the patio was a peaceful place to relax in the morning. I love how it’s within walking distance to a local brewery (which we walked to a couple nights!) and a few little shops! We would 100% stay in this loft again! If you’re needing a cute place to stay in Etown this is it!
There’s small little touches throughout the apartment that made it that much better!!"

This is the second time staying at a property ran by this host and I will be using properties from this host again. Highly recommend.
