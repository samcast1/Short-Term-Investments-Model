Stayed a few nights","I’m not entirely sure there are words for Scott his wife and co host! Our stay was beyond anything we could have ever imagined and then some. Scott was available for a late evening phone call and to our surprise him and his wife showed up at noon the next day to bless us on our wedding day. The house was impeccable and the pictures do not do it justice. We will never forget the hospitality and generosity we were given.
The beds were comfortable the pillows too! I personally used the down stairs shower and upstairs shower and main floor tub all were amazing. The kitchen had everything needed to cook with. The views were amazing it was such a private get away.
The hosts of this property were outstanding and again I could never sum up our experience into words. They literally feel like family to us.
We will be back and pray that everyone who visits enjoys their stay as we did.
Anyone looking to book please consider having a meal at the farmer’s daughter restaurant in Urbana."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at Scott’s Hideaway! We had 4 couples with little kids, and it was so fun! The hosts went above and beyond to welcome us with fresh farm eggs and freshly baked bread & jam. The place was perfectly clean. The towels were soft. It was truly ideal!
We did have to be cautious with the little kids and the stairs, but thankfully we had enough adult eyes to monitor.
We would definitely stay here if we end up visiting the area again!"

Stayed with a pet","Was welcomed immediately by Rita who was super friendly and gave us a lovely tour! A book of local restaurants and activities was posted online and in a binder in the cabin that was very helpful. The cabin itself was very clean and well decorated. The location was beautiful and quiet with beautiful trails for my dog to explore! Rita was super helpful the entire stay! During bad weather (tornado warnings) she communicated with us to make sure we were safe and was on top of the radar in case anything bad would have occurred (thankfully nothing did). She even provided an extra heater on a particularly cold night and left in on the porch for us without us asking! Very kind and considerate, going 100% above and beyond what I expected. Will definitely go and visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","We really loved our stay here. When we arrived, Rita mentioned that there was an opening the following night. Without hesitation, we took the second night. We felt right at home in this cabin. It was comfortable and clean with just enough decorations to accent the interior. On our full day, we wandered the trails, played some music and had dinner at The Farm Market Restaurant, based on Rita's suggestion. We didn't use the fire pit at night, but actually spent some time relaxing during the day. Plenty of wood was available, as well kindling and starters had we chosen to have a fire each night. The feeder, located within view of the front porch, provided a show of several bird varieties. On our drive to dinner, we spotted a Bald Eagle by it's large nest, which was a bonus. I think we may try to return to this little cabin, although it's not near any of our future bucket list excursions. Having stayed in 8 airbnb's over the course of 3 weeks, this was the BEST!"

Co-host Rita was there to greet us and our dogs as soon as we arrived to go over everything. The surrounding acreage had nice trails that we enjoyed with our pups. Beautiful spring flowers all through the woods made the walks extra special. We would definitely recommend to anyone in need of some downtime."

Rita was a great help welcoming us upon arrival, showing us around and getting us acquainted with the space, which had everything we needed. This is truly a special cabin and property. We spent hours hiking through the woods with our dog, taking as many ways through as we could to enjoy all the scenery. We left refreshed, with one very tired dog from all the exploring. The price for the experience was unmatched- we really appreciated how affordable it was to be able to get away and stay in the woods. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed with a pet","This is our second stay at the cabin. If you are looking for a relaxing, peaceful stay this is it. The cabin is the perfect size that had everything we needed. The wooded property is perfect for walks with the pup. (Loved our sunset walks) The porch is perfect for bird watching as well as sunsets. (I think I properly identified 5-with the help of the provided book) Just a short drive away is downtown Urbana with its small downtown charm. We spent some time there walking the neighborhood. We were excited that all of the shops welcomed our pup with opened arms. We thank Jared and Rita for giving us this opportunity. Rita, it was nice to see you again. ❤️"

The walking trails are great. The cabin was so quaint, well appointed and deocrated so well. The bird feeder has 3 male cardinals as regular visitors. The check in with Rita was very easy.

Stayed with a pet","My wife had been asking for a getaway from the stresses of work and this private retreat in the middle of a beautiful wooded property was just what she needed. We were greeted by Rita when we arrived and given a tour of the place. While I normally prefer having a self checkin, Rita was a joy to interact with and she was the sweetest guide ever. The cabin was very nice inside and out. Our dog also thoroughly enjoyed going for walks in the woods and sitting by the nearby fire. We were close enough to several small towns for when we wanted to go out for a night. In particular, we would highly recommend Fusion 40.38 and Teabaggers in Urbana. We will definitely be coming back."

It's located right next to another cabin but there is for sure privacy. I needed the getaway for some much needed peace and quiet to relax for a couple of days and unwind. It was the best place ever and I'm so glad I found it! Rita (co-host) was so welcoming and an absolute gem! She met me upon arrival and gave me a quick tour and run down. She was so lovely! It was nice to know that she was close by if I needed anything. Everything about this adventure was just what I needed! Thank you for hosting me!

Stayed a few nights","what an amazing little get away. I surprised my wife with the cabin after having to cancel our anniversary plans due to her needing surgery. and she was astonished, it is just our kind of cozy little place. This was our first air bnb experience and I couldn't have been happier. I originally thought this was a lone cabin tucked away in the woods which is what I am used to ... I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jared and Rita live right on site but everything is very thoughtfully set up in a way you still feel very private and secluded but someone is right there in case of emergency. The trails were great and kind of just wandered around the property. Everything was just a perfect addition to our visit all the way from Arizona. I only wish we could have brought our pups they would have loved it, Everything is set up to be very pet friendly. I can't say enough good things and what an amazing experience at such an affordable price. We will definitely be back.!"

Stayed with a pet",This was our third time staying at the cabin and already cannot wait to return. Jared and Rita are amazing hosts and think of everything to make your stay laid back and seamless. The cabin has everything you could need or want. A perfect quiet get away in nature. It's truly a perfect cabin and surrounding woods are beautiful year round. We love to hike and then cozy up in the cabin. The fact they allow you to share the experience with your fur babies is beyond amazing! Thank you for all the memories and sharing your space with us (and our dogs!)

Great communication and quick response if you have any questions. The cabin and grounds were beautiful and we enjoyed walking our dog on the various trails that are available on the property. We visited some local state parks and nature preserves while there. I highly recommend you give it a try. You won’t be sorry you did. We timed it just right for the Fall foliage. Thanks for having us! Hope to see you again sometime in the future!

It was extremely windy, however, I'm a trained chef and know how to wrap a grill so hot ash has a much lower chance of escaping the grill. .. other than that, I was a tiny bit taken aback by how close the property owner was to my cabin. As I soon found though, she left me completely alone. which is what I came for. I've already re-booked for june."

We loved that we were able to bring the dogs with us. Enjoyed the trails, took advantage of the fire pit, and relaxed in the hammock. I’m from Austin where there’s lots of outside things to do, moved to Indiana where there’s not as much, so I just loved every moment of this space. My husband and I also got to go to the Ohio Caverns and had a great time! The caverns were super close by so that was neat. Overall we had a nice weekend and I would (and already have) recommend this to friends. Rita was also a sweetie and got us all settled :)"

Stayed with a pet","A little slice of paradise! Although I almost hate to say that, because I don't want it to be impossible to book again next time we want to visit. It's the best of both worlds - you're in a private, secluded space surrounded by woods and peaceful farmland, yet you have all the comforts of modern living (including good water pressure and temperature in the shower, always my top priority). We loved the firepit, the nature trails, the starlit sky (no light pollution), and the comfortable bed and futon. The cozy log cabin was all-wood - floors, walls, furniture - which we also loved. And Rita made us feel completely at home and welcome, including our dog, who even got her own blankets and towels to use."

The hosts are very thoughtful and had everything we could have needed. We enjoyed the trails and hanging out by the fire (everything was provided). The kids loved the hammock. The area surrounding the cabin is so beautiful and they have a very nice welcome book that had a detailed list of places to eat and/or visit in the area. We ended up going to Ohio Caverns which is only about 10 minutes from the cabin and it was an amazing experience. I enjoyed relaxing on the front porch in the morning with my tea (which was provided), watching the birds and listening to nature. Before we left, a hummingbird came up to my daughter’s window for a few seconds as if it were saying goodbye. ☺️"

The cabin and its surroundings were pristine and beautiful and included all the amenities needed to create an enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere. We have traveled extensively and for extended periods of time, both domestically and abroad, but our brief getaway at The Cabin at Maple View still stands out as one of our most enjoyable and memorable travel experiences, mainly because of the personal touch and incredible attention to detail of our hosts, Jared and Rita."

One thing to note - you are going to be right next to the host. The pictures don't do a great job of showing it, but the cabin is about 10 feet away from another one, so it's not as secluded as it looks"

The trails were so well maintained that it was easy to walk. we had rain throughout our time, but the canopy is so thick the rain had little effect on the trails. The cabin was perfect, we ever loved hearing the rain on the tin roof. the bed was super comfortable. Rita gave us such wonderful recommendations for towns to visit and things to do.

Many nice small amenities (fire pit w/wood, charcoal grill, hiking trails, great wifi, interesting reads, etc) and felt cozy. The binder of points-of-interest helped us plan our evenings, which really enhanced our trip! Close to town where you can enjoy a great meal and the charm of Urbana's town square, but tucked away enough that you're truly in the woods. We didn't need anything, but felt like if we did, the hosts would quickly fill our needs. We will be back, no doubt!"

Stayed a few nights","Honest review. Good and bad things to say. We will be back here again to start. The cabin was great. Felt like it could be called home. It looked just like the photos. The bed, chair and futon were very comfortable. There was plenty to do inside the cabin when it was raining such as puzzles and games but the real place to be is outside. The wildlife which in our case was birds, red squirrels and chipmunks was very enjoyable. Our last night... we did hear a coyote close to the cabin. The trails were a great way to spend time. They were clear and easy to walk. Probably my favorite part the stars. The stars were awesome. Onto the bad. There is more than one cabin on the property and even one right next to our cabin. This made the feeling like the entire property being ours not true. I'm sure the owners wouldn't care much for noise or other things but felt limited. The gym was not part of the cabin The worst was one of the dogs who would bark at us and scare away the animals."

It is also quite a close drive to the Ohio Caverns, which is great location-wise to take a day and go to, as well as visit some local markets and restaurants.

Stayed one night","One of the best AirBNB places I have stayed in. beautiful surroundings, and just the right sized cabin. Tasteful, immaculate, everything you need to enjoy the woods and a little quiet time. Rita was super welcoming, I instantly felt at home. Excellent price, they have purposely made this space affordable, and that means a lot to me. I came through town for work, but ended up having a nice little respite. Thank you, Rita and Jared."

Stayed a few nights","From our gracious greeting by Rita until a later-than-some-places check out we had a relaxing, enjoyable stay. My adult son with autism and I wanted a few days away from the city where we could experience some quiet and a slower pace. Despite some rain drizzle we were able to enjoy a stroll through the adjoining woods. The cabin is a great starting point for trips into Urbana, Yellow Springs and other nearby sights: John Bryan State Park, Glen Helen Nature Preserve, Clifton Gorge, Young's Jersey Dairy, just to name a few. Thanks so much for allowing us to stay at your cozy cabin!"

Stayed a few nights","The two of us had a wonderful four night stay. They met us at check in which was quite helpful and showed us a few things. It was all written in a book also, but it was nice to not have to read instructions when we first arrived. We went hiking every day. So many places within A 30 min drive. My favorite was Kaiser lake just 10 min away. Urbana square has great restaurants and a fantastic cupcake place. It is only 15 minutes away. And of course the fire pit and hiking is right out your back door. We don’t have a dog and there was no issues with allergies or anything for us which is a bonus. But very dog friendly for people who have dogs. We will stay again. Thanks for a great trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Jared and Rita were WONDERFUL hosts. The cabin was just what my husband and I wanted for our honeymoon. Jared was kind enough to allow us to bring our dog, a one year old Golden Retriever. He loved the trails right out from the cabin and hanging with us by the fire at night.
The TV had cable channels and even though Rita thought not, there was plenty of WiFi service to stream!
We loved that it was affordable, and was very dog friendly! (A very small fee for our dog).
Rita greeted us upon entry, to explain a few things and then let us relax. The directions to the cabin were spot on, and the GPS helped us get there just fine.
We definitely want to come back!!"

It is closer to other buildings on the property than I realized, but this was not an issue as the orientation of the cabin creates a private space that feels like you're nestled in the forest. The cabin faces the woods, with an entrance to the hiking trails just steps from the porch. I appreciated that firewood was provided, and found the cabin to be very clean and well appointment. Highly recommended!"

The bed and indoor seating is super comfortable! A stay at Jared and Rita's cabin is a great way Relax and step away from busy life. The hosts are also super helpful and welcoming.

When we arrived the lighting was perfection and there were fresh fruits waiting for us as well as a nice bottle of wine. The rooms were large and expansive, everything looked beautiful and felt comfortable. The washer and dryer were appreciated too.
It was fun to look out the beautiful arched window and see the activities going on.
In the morning, you can run down the stairs and go into a nice coffee shop. Antique stores and restaurants and some smaller boutique stores were all around and in close walking distance. I could not have asked for a nicer place to stay."

Stayed one night","On the bright side, we did see some wildlife and the internet was strong. Unfortunately, the rental was let down by many little things and one big thing.
The big thing was that the unit was just dated and old. The flooring in the kitchen was loose to the point where removal now would probably not require tools. The baseboard heater in the bathroom did not seem to do anything sand was probably left in place. This would be fine if it were not lose and hanging iff the wall by an angle. I could go on but this is a theme in the unit.
Again, the unit was not all bad. It is obvious that the unit contained seasonal materials- an obvious attempt to mitigate some of the rentals shortcomings.
If this unit rented for less than$100 with a $50 or less cleaning fee, there might be some value here, but at the advertised price there are better values in the 43311 market."

She was also willing to let us check in a little early to squeeze a nap in before seeing family, since the house was cleaned already!
The home is located right off the freeway and gives easy access to Bellefontaine, Marysville, Columbus, etc. Tons of food in the area (and both local + chain options)."

The space provided was perfect for the six of us to get ready for our event. Even though there was one bathroom, we all had enough space to do what we needed to do. Sleeping arrangements were great too, couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay for a few nights!"

We were staying with our kids (6, 6, and 2.5) for 2 nights and she offered to have some toys there for them when we got there. Without knowing, she brought our son's fav book and perfect toys for the girls! The house was clean and had all the basics (including plastic kids dishes, also a plus). Close to Bellefontaine but not right in town, there was enough of a yard area that we were able to spend time outside and the kids could burn off some energy. One night we counted 11 deer. A binder with area attractions and places to eat was provided and gave us some good tips. Overall, very comfortable and relaxing. Definitely would recommend!"

Stayed one night","A very lovely stay, check in was super easy and communication was always quick. The turn into the property is right before a highway exit and can come up pretty quick, but the private road/drive is tucked away and feels secluded and private while being so close to wonderful restaurants/the city.
The thermostat worked super well, we prefer it being fairly cool and snuggling under blankets, it stood up to the heat no problem.
The living room area was where we spent most of our time, watching movies and escaping the August heat. The TV was rather small, so if you plan on doing the same as we did you may want to bring your own (not sure it that is allowed as I didn't ask the host, please ask first). The TV being on the smaller side was the only thing that was possible of critique, but we used the GIANT beanbag chair to sit closer and made it work.
The bed in the navy room was so comfortable we almost slept through check out time! There are ample supplies, towels, plates, blankets, pillows, etc. The backyard has a fireplace and there are logs on site.
There is a basket of goodies/snacks/ramen in the kitchen. Ridiculous amounts of counter space, huge fridge and freezer. There is a lot of coffee pods and condiments in the fridge.
Really a lovely stay, sorry for the novel but there was a lot to gush about!"

The communication with the host was great! We were glad we followed previous guest's suggestion to bring our own drinking water, as the water does have an unpleasant sulfur smell. Also, be aware that the doorways are narrow, and ceilings are lower than standard house, so might be a problem for someone who is larger or taller. I am 5' 6"" tall and scraped my knuckles on the bathroom ceiling when trying to get undressed. We stayed in July, so skiing was not an option, but the top of the ski hill is just outside the back door. It was a great place to watch the sunset and observe deer grazing. If you enjoy skiing Mad River Mountain, this is the perfect ski weekend spot!"

We loved hiking near/on the ski hills and checking out the Ohio Caverns. She had lovely welcome touches when we got there and the deck and fire pit were great entertainment for us. The kids played outside all day. The one thing I would bring is a pizza pan and a few pots. There were only 2 pans to cook on the stove with so that made cooking interesting :) We can’t wait to come back in the winter for some skiing and snow tubing!!!

We did not use the loft (just 2 of us), but there is so much room up there for anyone to enjoy the space. Kids would love it!
Annette was so quick with all of her replies to my questions and so friendly.

Stayed with kids","This was our second stay at Hilltop Hideaway. We were greeted yet again with a nice clean space, a personalized welcome sign and a little sweet treat (yummy cupcakes this time!). The inside of the tiny home was as sparkling clean inside as the last time. It was a little warmer this stay than the last time so we spent even more time utilizing all the outdoor spaces. The large covered deck with a propane heater is fabulous. Especially if you have a rain out morning like we did (rain in the morning meant a private ""mountain"" to ski on in the afternoon!). We sat out on the deck and stayed warm and dry and enjoyed watching the few skiers out in the pouring rain from our dry and warm seats on the deck. We also enjoyed the fire ring with plenty of wood provided by the host. There is really not much tiny about this tiny home the great room has huge windows and high ceilings, a nice large kitchen, bathroom space and plenty of places to put things in cupboards and out of the way. The loft space is very spacious with a nice comfy mattress (with PLENTY of room to spare) up there for adults or kids. The bedroom has a sliding glass door out onto the covered deck, a TV, a fireplace and plenty of storage space for your belongings. Our favorite part of the bedroom is being able to lay in bed and watch Mad River Mountain make snow at night or skiers in the morning. You are close enough to the slopes to watch, but just back far enough from the runs that go behind the house to not feel like when you have the curtain open everyone is looking in at you. This property would be enjoyable year round with all of its space inside and out. Enjoy your stay! I know we did and we will be back!"

Annette was very quick to respond to questions. House was clean and just as described. Loft was a fun bedroom for our 8 year old. Will definitely stay here next winter for another ski trip at Mad River."

Stayed with kids","Annette is a thoughtful and responsive host. This tiny home is sparkling clean and adorable inside. The location is unbeatable for a weekend of skiing. We enjoyed laying in bed at night and watching the snow making machines run and the crews work on the hills. Then during the day you can watch skiers or even better join them! The loft space is very large and my boys loved it up there. If it's cold enough the top of the ""mountain"" is it's own little winter wonderland with the over blow from the snow making machines. This property is a gem and I bet it is also lovely in the summer. If you are looking for a getaway, look no further. We cannot wait to return and stay and ski again!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved, loved, loved this place! It was immaculately clean, quiet, and cozy. It’s small, but big enough for a couple or a family with small kids. We could look out the bedroom patio doors to a beautiful view of the top of the ski slopes. The bed was very comfortable; we slept so good all 3 nights. Full-size appliances and enough cookware for general cooking needs. The gas fireplace was enough to keep the place warm and helped provide a cozy feel, so we didn’t need to turn on the heat (visited mid-October). Bathroom had lots of storage and counter space. The large counter in the kitchen had 4 very comfortable stools around it, and the farmhouse sink was huge! Upstairs, the loft was much bigger than expected. It would be perfect for small kids up there - they would have lots of room up there to play and feel like they had their own spot. It rained most of one day, so we pulled out the sofa bed in the living area to lounge back, watch tv, and read. Cell phone coverage was fast (AT&T) and reliable. No WiFi or cable, but lots of stations from the digital antennae.
Overall, the campground was quiet and peaceful, and we enjoyed walking around the campground and to the top of the slopes. The view from up there was amazing! It was about a 15-minute drive to nearby Bellefontaine, which has lots of cute shops and great restaurants. There were also various hiking trails within a 30-minute drive, as well as a riding stable right across 33.
The funny thing is that I have driven by Mad River Mountain hundreds of times back and forth to Columbus and back. Can’t believe this is the first time I actually travelled up that mountain! :-) We live only an hour away and we will be coming back often when we need to relax and unwind! We so enjoyed our stay and appreciated the cupcakes and snacks - what a nice touch!"

This house was like stepping inside of Instagram. All of the features and the little touches that the hosts added made this place a ""picture-perfect"" destination.(see what I did there?) Anyway, it had everything that we needed and then some. The furniture was extremely comfortable and we had our first really good night of sleep during our road trip. We had just come from the Smoky Mountains and stayed in a corporate-run cabin there that we thought was great but Annette could show them a few things about how to host and a great stay. We will definitely be coming back here. Maybe in the wintertime to check out the ski resort. Also, just a few steps from the back door you can watch the sunset of the nearby hills. Quite stunning."

It was evident that they have gone above and beyond with the amenities they’ve included that contributed to making our stay a hassle-free, enjoyable one.
The cottage is well decorated and the couches are SO comfy. The kitchen has lots of cookware and utensils that made preparing meals a breeze. A full spice rack, coffee, tea, oils for cooking… made our trip to the grocery an easy one. Mints and towels on the beds were a nice touch and the bathroom had some items for guests in case you forgot anything from home. The attention to detail was really appreciated!
We had a great Christmas celebration meeting some of our family from Columbus and enjoyed watching movies on the large TV. Just wish we could’ve stayed longer! Hosts were great with communication and so great to deal with! Highly recommend this cottage!"

Stayed one night","We stayed at the mini house on Honey Birch Farm. It was such an incredible stay!! It was a surprise for my wife’s birthday, and they left a bottle of champagne, roses, and a happy birthday balloon. Incredible start! The house was great and so cool, amazing how many rooms they had in there! The property was breathtaking! Incredible walking trails, and a beautiful pond! We got some amazing pictures. Mark was a fantastic host! We will stay there again and recommend it highly"

Stayed with a pet","When first pulling up, I knew we chose the best place in the area! Beautiful yard, especially for fall time. It is extremely easy to spot his driveway since there is a large sign at the end of the driveway. The place was as good as it looked in the pictures, very well built and the decorations inside fit the place perfectly! The view from the windows was perfect. It overlooked the hilly farms. The sun rise that came in over the trees was my favorite part. If you are looking to stay somewhere near the caverns, I highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","Small Town Feels was the perfect rental for our family trip.
Upon entering, there was no concern of cleanliness - Kari has the place spotless. While an older home, they have done a very nice and tasteful job of updating it. Very cute!!
The beds were extremely comfortable, towels were of good quality, and the water was nice and hot. The living room furniture was very clean and again, very comfortable.
We appreciated the use of the washer and dryer while we were there as well.
Being able to travel with our pup was definitly a plus!

And my whole family raved about the toilet paper (it's the little things like quality TP that care really make the difference...details matter). Based on our stay, we have upgraded some of our own living conditions... but we will never have an awesome basement like this house. It was perfect for our late night teens to spread out without disturbing our sleep."

Stayed about a week","Kari was a tremendous host during our 10-night stay. Couldn’t recommend this property more highly if you are seeking a short or medium stay solution in Bellefontaine. We could feel the warmth and hospitality from how new, clean, comfortable and well-equipped the home is.
Hands down, the most well-equipped home I’ve ever rented. Fridge, pantry, kitchen fully stocked including a few snacks and drinks. Very comfortable and cozy living room and bedrooms.
Beautiful home on a quiet street just a short 2-min drive from the main drag and local restaurants.
Thank you for being flexible with us during our stay as our flight training schedule changed so much. We wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else.
If you are planning to come to KEDJ for flight training, this is your place."

We wanted to do some grilling. They went out and bought a brand new grill for us to use! There is a water softener and the water feels like silk when you shower. The neighborhood is quiet. No issues whatsoever. The kitchen is fully equipped and the closets are stocked with cleaning supplies, tissues, Band-aids, etc. Everything you need for a comfortable stay.

Stayed about a week","This place is a great find in Bellefontaine, and we couldn't be happier about our stay here! It's a very cute place and much more spacious on the inside than it looks from the street, with a nice patio out back. It nails all the basics (good sized rooms that match the listing, spotlessly clean, seamless check in and out) and then really goes above and beyond in thoughtful amenities and extras. From all sorts of extra toiletries that saved us from having to run to the store for little things we forgot, to a kitchen stocked with an incredible array of tools and treats, to a laundry area with everything you'd need away from home. They'd even decorated the living room for Christmas! Our host was available and attentive without being intrusive, and while we didn't have any issues it was clear she would've been quick to respond if we had. All in all a 5-star stay. This will be top of our list next time we visit the area!"

You do hear everything within the unit, so don’t expect privacy between the bedrooms. We did not however hear the neighbor at all in the connected unit.
Appreciated the coffee in the morning before we left. 😁"

This home met my needs and then some. Parking was off-street and the parking pad was probably 40 feet deep, allowing family to tandem park in front of me. The interior was well-equipped with dishes, cooking, and serving utensils to entertain. Everything in the unit seemed new and it included a washer/dryer! The bedrooms were nice and the bathrooms were modern and well-appointed.
Jennifer and her team were very responsive and provided a well-thought-through welcome package leaving nothing to guess about. I will definitely stay again when the need arises!"

We had to be a little creative in cooking without a full cooktop and oven, but the electric skillet, instant pot, and gas grill saved the day. 🙂 Our young adult kids enjoyed the various indoor games, TV, and hot tub.

The instructions were very clear and listed in areas or the home so there was no confusion. Although there was no oven there are other ways to cook we were able to use the grill and there was an electric skillet along with a toaster oven so we had no issues. The air bnb was much bigger then expected which was great because we came in a small group. The rooms were so comfortable and cute we felt right at home I also brought my 4 year old and he was entertained by all the toys that were there so he had just as much fun as we did. Definitely plan on booking again in the future we had fun

Because we are rarely all together, I was happy we were able to stay in one location. The space was very clean and equipped with plenty of towels and blankets. The hot tub was a perfect way to relax after our 9 hour drive and again with our family. We look forward to staying again when we are in the area."

Group trip","Annette and Dan were beyond accommodating and extremely responsive to every possible need for our family of 5. She even asked what my kids would prefer to have for their breakfast drinks prior to us arriving, and sure enough there they were in the fridge! This space is HUGE. The lower level has brand new carpets and the place is spotless clean. The kids beds are huge and SUPER comfortable and they have everything you would ever need. Extra pillows and blankets. Space heaters. EVERYTHING! My kids loved playing the shuffleboard and getting in the very nice hot tub. 5 minutes from stores but the surroundings are absolutely gorgeous. Very close to Ohio Caverns. I recommend this place for any and ALL Bellefontaine, OH events and activities! We'll be back if we're in the area! Thank you for your hospitality, Annette!"

Stayed with kids","Location was great, close to the Ohio Caverns and locals restaurants. The place was very clean and well-maintained, with nice updates. The kitchenette has everything we needed for a short trip, and it was nice to have bedrooms for everyone vs. a hotel! The hot tub was fabulous as well.
2-3 of the bedrooms aren't terribly toddler-proof (ink stamps/crafts in one, VHS tapes and journals on low shelves in another, etc.), but wouldn't be a problem for most people visiting. just something to be aware of.
Internet is fine for light usage, but less good for work, etc.
Overall we had a great stay, and would happily stay here again!"

We were there for 2 nights and it's a great place to relax. There were 10 of us and everyone was satisfied. There are no close neighbors, and there is beautiful nature. I think it's worth coming to a house like this for the weekend.
We are going to come again because there is everything you need for a good holiday, and the owners of the House are constantly in contact with us and asked if we need something.
We are very happy with this house and this weekend"

Stayed a few nights","Two girlfriends and I visited for a girls weekend with the intent to relax and have time away from the hustle and bustle of everyday hectic life. This airbnb was like no other, but not in a positive way.
The listing and pictures from the exterior are very deceiving. None of the pictures are from the ""private"" patio, which has minimal viewing pleasure. The pictures on the listing are from the owners front porch and their elevated deck. The listing also states that it is a quiet serene vacation destination. While I did understand that we would be staying in the basement of the owners house who live there, I didn't expect to have to deal with the level of noise that we experienced. Apparently they were entertaining guests all day Saturday and there appeared to be no attempt to keep the noise of running, jumping or talking to a reasonable level. We had to keep turning up the volume on the TV to hear over it, that's when I messaged the owners who then moved the entertaining outside. The set up of the deck steps coming right onto the private patio made a private patio, not so private. This feeling of not having privacy would have been lessened if there were curtains on the windows. The listing also states that the hot tub is private. It was clearly used while we were away for a few hours on Saturday. There was no chance we were going to be able to use it on Saturday night due to the owners moving their entertainment to the fire pit that sits about 15 feet away from the hot tub. The listing also shows that the entry is with a lockbox. There was a lockbox there, though it wasn't used and when we left the property at any time it was left unlocked. No mattress on the lower bunk of the bunkbed, so one of the adults had to sleep on the loft bed that wasn't ideal for our situation.
Open communication goes a long way. We weren't given a heads up that they would be entertaining and that it may be louder than usual.
The positives are that the space was clean, updated, spacious and comfortable plush carpet."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for a beautiful home to stay at to get away for a weekend, or for a home large enough for your friends and family then look no further! My friend and I had an amazing stay and we enjoyed the hot tub on a couple of cool/rainy nights. They have lots of games to play and they’re less than 10 minutes from the nearest grocery store, as well as the largest caverns in Ohio! That was something we didn’t know until we got there and went to see them before we left town:) but the coolest thing of all in my opinion, is the face that they built this house themselves!! I didn’t know that either until I got there. They did an amazing job and I highly recommend staying there if you’re going to be in the area!"

We stayed here with our two small children while visiting family. We did not spend much time at the property, as there was so much to do nearby, but what little time we spent there was fantastic. There is obviously a great deal of pride and care put into the space. There were plenty of games and toys for the children, which they appreciated. We appreciated how spotlessly clean and new everything was. This is an outstanding place to stay, and we had a great time.
While it's quiet and feels like it's ""out in the country"", you are only a short drive to downtown Bellefontaine or West Liberty."

Stayed with kids","The location is a little out of the way but if your looking to disconnect and spend time with family this is your place. The house is absolutely beautiful. The only complaint we had was the way to the back of the house which is the downstairs where you actually stay in. Is only half cement bricks lined to make a path and two are loose and not a full sidewalk so trying to bring suitcase and young kiddos in and not trip or fall was a challenge. We absolutely loved the Bible scriptures on the doors it was nice to be able to see and then look up and explain to kiddos. They have a ton of board games, ping pong and toys for the kiddos as well. The hot tub was absolutely perfect! Dan and Annette answered all questions and texts with concerns no matter what time. I appreciate the hospitality! Definitely recommend staying here!"

Mitch is fabulous and his antique store is worth a visit. We were in the area for a tournament so didn’t spend as much time as we wanted to in the DD. It was great to be able to spread out and relax in the evenings. Mitch also knows his coffee too! We will definitely stay at the DD again when in town for the tournament.

When plans changed (due to a previous local tornado) and things needed to be shuffled around, Mitch was super-accommodating and helped simplify an otherwise complicated situation. His place was clean and comfortable, was located in a walk-able location and had a great decor. Mitch was also very helpful & knowledgeable about happenings in the area. He also had the fastest response time of any Air Bnb host I have ever encountered. I would recommend Mitch's place to anyone."

I spent 5 weeks at this lovely apartment, while attending pilot school in nearby Bellefontaine. I had a great time and Mitch was a superb host. I only had to reach out to the host a couple of times for questions and he responded within a minute!
The apartment is a trip to the 60s and 70s, decorated in a unique style with beautiful antiques. I recognized several items that could be found in any home of that era, including my parents house.
The apartment is very spacious with two bedrooms an office, a full dining room and a giant living room. I did a lot of cooking in the large kitchen which was well appointed with appliances.
It's on a quiet and safe street without almost no through traffic. Very quiet at night!
Parking was very easy, with a spot in front of the door every time.
Overall, a great Airbnb that is hosted by a friendly & responsive host. I would definitely stay again next time I'm in the area. Book it and you will not be disappointed"

The hosts are so friendly and I can't wait to come back. Communication was clear, on-going and Mitch was very responsive. Thank you for this great space!

Stayed a few nights","Wow! what a gem we were able to find here at Kate's place which is located right beside a Piatt Castle. We had 3 deer in our front yard one day. I was able to play my guitar as loud as I wanted to play it because the nearest house was 300 yards away. We were able to have dinner guests over three nights in a row which we could have never done at a cookie cutter hotel room in Bellefontaine where our family lives. We had a great time. The time came and went way too fast. If you are looking for peace and quiet with lots of room in a cabin in the woods......this is it!!!!! Bruce and Donna Gasperson, Ridgecrest, NC 13-17 May, 2024. This is our 17th ABNB booking and it was a gem."

Stayed a few nights","This was our first time using AirB&B, so we were unsure what to expect. This property blew us away! Very charming from the outside, but the inside takes you back to a simpler time, yet includes all the modern amenities you would hope for. The cabin was exceptionally clean but didn’t feel “cold hospital sanitized”… it was very welcoming and just felt warm and “homey”. We were in town for an event, and unfortunately the castle next door was not open for the season yet, as we would have loved to experience that! We stayed for a weekend, 7.5 hours from home. On our drive home, we were contemplating making the trip again just to spend a week at the Piatt Cabin. Well done to our host Kate and the Piatt family, for an incredible renovation on this historic site. We wish we could pick the cabin up and bring it home with us."

A bit more privacy would have been great, but it is at the end of a Cul De Sac. The cabin was so clean with clear cleaning instructions, including all bedding (I like that they make it clear that quilts and all are cleaned) and special trash bags. There are cozy spots for games and puzzles which we loved. Jodee was a great communicator and very friendly. We will definitely be back in the future."

We’ve stayed in air bnbs before that do not offer these things, and it’s just nice to not have to pack it all. It is at the end of a residential street, which We expected after reading other reviews. So if you’re looking to be deep in the woods, this probably isn’t for you. We loved our stay here! It is very cozy and clean! Ohio Caverns are right down the road, and so cool! Highly recommend. Bellefontaine is close by and has good restaurants, we ate at Brewfontaine and Iron City Sports Bar. Both were excellent."

Beds were comfy, linens and towels were plush, and we appreciated the strong Wi-Fi. Roomy kitchen was perfect for cooking and dining (head’s up there is a stovetop but no oven, however, there is a toaster oven!). We didn’t realize how close the cabin was to civilization/other houses, but we still felt secluded, and the standout features were the screened-in porch and fire pit situated right along the river. We visited and loved Marie’s candies and Stoner’s ice cream, and the kids had a great time at the playground and splash pad right down the street."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for 3 nights and really liked the peacefulness of the property. We sat in the enclosed porch at the back of the property which looked onto the river and watched occasional joggers/walkers/dog-walkers in the field over the river. There is some occasional traffic noise during the day from a not-busy road that is in earshot, but this is occasional and very quiet at night. During the day there is a vehicle every couple of minutes or so
We loved sitting on the enclosed porch at night listening to the river and bird song. It was very peaceful and relaxing, and we felt very safe in all areas.
We used the cafe (Sweetie Pie) in West Liberty that does good espresso - we like strong coffee. There is a drip coffee machine with coffee supplies in the property which we used. We also used the ice-cream parlour in WL, and enjoyed take out restaurants in Bellefontiaine (Flying Pepper Cantina) and Urbana (Cafe Paradiso) which are a 10 minute drive away.
A lovely stay."

My grandkids loved exploring the cabin and finding all the games and puzzles and the record player. There was a perfect selection of activities for extended family on a wintry weekend. We spent Saturday wandering the thrift and antique shops in town and visiting the candy shop. We hope to come back in summer to stay so we can tour the Ohio caverns and enjoy the porches and fire pit on the property. Jodee communicated throughout our stay. Honestly, everything was perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","Don't hesitate! Book this amazing stay!
I wanted to enjoy Thanksgiving someplace close to home, where my aging parents could just simply relax. When we pulled up to the cabin, we were pleasantly surprised! The cabin is in a neighborhood----but feels like an oasis all by itself. The property is gorgeous with the river running behind it. The property has mature trees and no neighboring houses behind the cabin. When we walked into the cabin, it smelled brand new. The whole house was so cozy. We loved the layout of the cabin and the decor. The screened in patio was an added plus. Cannot wait to come back in the summer so we can enjoy it more. The beds were extremely comfortable. There were plenty of pots and pans, utensils etc. in the kitchen.
The only problem we had was having to leave. We wanted to move in instead!"

Stayed with kids","Nice place for a weekend getaway. There is a wonderful firepit by the small river which is relaxing, along with a fireplace inside. The host has provided a good amount of dishes, silverware, pans and cooking utensils for use. Our group of 4 adults and 3 young children ran out of clean cups several times but that may just be a result of children using multiple cups and not keeping track of them. There is a charcoal grill for grilling, along with a stovetop but no oven.
If you are arriving late be advised that most restaurants close relatively early, as does the gas station and the pizza shop does not take credit cards. If you are looking for a nice hike or nature walk there are several nearby nature preserves. You may want to download directions before leaving because a couple people in our group had no cellular service and had trouble navigating. The host provides wireless internet which is helpful if you need to get any work done while on your trip."

We were able to have our 3 year old grandson in the cute room with the tent and the 1 year old w/ his parents in the other room. We took the master bedroom on the 1st floor & had access to the restroom from our room as well. We were not able to make full use of the place since we were there for a family reunion, but it would've been very easy to spend a week there just relaxing around the fire pit or the screened in porch. Many amenities were available. We were very pleased with the home & its location."

West Liberty is a fun town to explore. It is a nice town to ride bikes and there is a bike trail on the west side of town that we did not try. At the icecream shop in town a kids size is 2 scoops which was plenty for us. Linens and towels were delightful. We enjoyed our visit to the Ohio Caverns and a concert at the Piat Castle which were close by. Bellefountaine is 10 minutes away and has a Wal Mart, Kroger, etc. We would highly recommend this location."

It’s the perfect place to unwind and disconnect from the world on a solo trip, or to reconnect as a couple. I personally stayed solo and it was just what I needed. Peaceful, and serene, just so beautiful inside and out.
Hosts were super responsive and kind. I had a couple questions that were already answered on a sheet of paper right by the front door, but I didn’t see it until the day I left, likely due to my excitement when I arrived. They never once seemed frustrated or annoyed with me, just very kindly responded with the answers to my questions and very quickly.
Thank you so much Jamie, Matthew, and hosts! Bless you for opening up your beautiful property to Airbnb, may you always be treated with the same sweet kindness you’ve extended to complete strangers. :)"

Stayed a few nights","This was mine and my husband’s second stay at the yurts on Jamie’s property, and we had just as pleasant of a stay as the first time. The setting is beautiful, peaceful and private. We saw over 30 deer around our yurt in the morning and evening, and the hike to the pond was serene. We had a minor hiccup when we first arrived, but Jamie and Matthew responded immediately and went above and beyond to remedy the situation. I definitely think we will be back again in the spring. It’s a perfect way to escape into the woods and find some peace."

Stayed a few nights","The Northshore Cottage was a beautiful stay by Indian Lake. It was a cute cottage that was perfect for a winter getaway for my wife and her friends. The place was very reasonably priced and the quality of the home was even better in-person. Bathroom was renovated and incredible quality.
Beds and furniture were very comfy and clean. Host did provide heating options for the cottage since it’s winter and by the lake.
Location was great if you’re wanting to be close to the Indian Lake area. Home faces an open park space that shows the lake that you can walk around.
Great place for coffee called Brown Bean is on the road connected to the neighborhood that the cottage is located in. Grocery store and great donut shop called Donut Shop on the Lake is just 10 minutes away.
Thank you Peter and Shannon for opening up your place! We look forward to potentially visiting again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at this tiny house was so charming for a group of 3 adults. It was just enough room for us! We were able to see the solar eclipse & felt like we had plenty of space to separate us from other campers without feeling entirely disconnected. The owner of the campgrounds was also extremely friendly & introduced himself to us when we arrived to help us get in, & then later allowed us to use his firewood. The electricity had a few blips, but we suspect it might have something to do with the campgrounds being overwhelmed with eclipse visitors because once everyone cleared out, we experienced almost no power blips. The temperature was pleasant & breezy, & the sounds of nature made for a peaceful sleep."

There was an unforseeable issue before we got there and the owner already had a solution and had emailed me about it while I was on my way. It worked out fine but he gave a partial refund for the inconvenience. I would 100% recommend and would stay there again!"

The design of the space and decor is beautiful, my mother in law kept saying she wanted to move in! Our kids loved having a TV in their room and the cute breakfast nook table in the kitchen they claimed as their own. They also were very upset when we had to leave and asked when we can come back. We are definitely looking forward to repeating our stay and hopefully for longer next time. Thomas was a gracious host responding quickly and helpfully to all of our messages and questions.
