Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved staying at this Airbnb! The house was clean, had plenty of space to move around, and was absolutely adorable! We stayed at Christmas time, and the house was all decorated for Christmas when we arrived. It was the perfect location for me when visiting family, and was right off of the highway so it made it was very convenient for that reason as well! We stayed with our dog, and Rita even made sure to leave a roll of dog bags out for us, which was so kind! Thank your the wonderful stay! :)"

Group trip",Rita is a great host!! EVERYTHING is already at the house that you would need to feel right at home! Stayed once before and was even more exciting to stay this time with the Halloween and Fall decorations that she added. Also liked the screened in porch area that was added from the previous stay. Both additions made it more of a home like feel! Ample space in the house and for a great price!

Stayed about a week","A comfortable and cozy home in a laid-back country town. Lots of room, with a big laundry room and a big enclosed front porch. The kitchen was well-equipped. Beds were comfortable , plenty of water pressure and hot water in the shower. A big lot with lots of parking.
Rita was very responsive, and our only regret was that we didn't get to meet her because she had to go out of town. However her daughter, whom we met, was very close to back her up if needed.
If we need to return to the area, we would definitely stay there again."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed 9/8-9/12 and the only downfall is I couldn’t live here permanently. The air bnb is chíc and comfortable. There is everything you need from shampoo, body wash,towels, kitchenware every appliance needed and even fun games. Oh and IDK what she uses but her blankets smell amazing! Abra is super thoughtful and even leaves goodies for you!
The bed is super comfortable( ive stayed in tons of air bnbs and this is far the best sleep Ive ever had)
The pool is just right it has a shallow and deep end and in the right season is amazing to enjoy. Although the house is attached we had all the privacy we asked for!
It is 40 minutes from Corning Museum of Glass and Watkins Glen park which are the two musts when visiting!
Check-in is super easy as well, which is important after a long drive! We brought our dog and she had ample space to run and I felt super safe leaving her while we went to the museum! Thank you Abra well be back !!!"

Stayed with a pet","I wish that I could give this home 10 stars. My Husband and I are from the area but live out of state now. We traveled home for our wedding week and needed our own space with our fur babies. Not only was Abra’s home beautiful and peaceful, she had EVERYTHING one could possibly need. Upon arrival we noticed that the fridge was stocked with waters, eggs, coffee creamer, and syrup (all the things people usually forget to bring with them). The coffee bar was easily the highlight of the kitchen amenities!!
In the bathroom there were even extra toiletries for guest that may have forgotten some essentials!
The hospitality, communication, and flexibility has been unmatched to any of our previous Air BnB stays. Highly recommend and given our frequent visits to the area, we will definitely be returning!"

Stayed with kids","Overall we had a good stay! We came up to visit my son for the weekend who is a student at Mansfield and this worked out because it is only about 30 minutes from campus. The farmhouse has all amenities of home (minutes a microwave) with a huge bathroom, fireplace and a nice firepit with firewood provided. There were also sanitary napkins available in the bathroom which came in handy. There is also a dog and cat that roams around. The only things I noticed were the steps are wobbly coming up onto the porch, the bedrooms do not have dedicated doors; they have barn doors which can be difficult maneuver (declined to have the host fix it when I brought it to her attention) so you can't fully close off the bedrooms. There is a lot of road noise, so if you are a light sleeper you will not enjoy the location. Communication was fine while we were there but beforehand it was slow and I had to follow up each time before receiving a response which is surprising for a super host."

Stayed one night","This is a self-contained apartment in a farmhouse on a large dairy farm that is located far from any restaurants or stores. The kitchen would be great for cooking ones own meals (but my family only was there one night, unfortunately). The host's family is very friendly, and so are the kittens and dog. We loved this stay. We will definitely return one day. Just to set expectations, it is important to realize that a dairy farm includes strong smells. We got used to it quickly. The tranquility of the setting is unique and much appreciated"

Stayed with a pet","I've always wanted to milk a cow. As a child, when I saw people on TV struggling to work the teets with their hands, I always thought I'd be able to do it better. I still have yet to experience that (or be proven wrong), but at age 59, this tranquil setting with the cows nearby is just perfect for my sensibilities. What an incredible view of undulating hills and farmlands stretching to the horizon. I spent a night in this lovely farmhouse with my husband and two dogs while doing some work in Athens, PA, as an alternative to a very expensive average chain hotel in the area. What an absolute treat. And since it was toward the end of our long road trip from Chicago, I was able to watch TV, get online to catch up on work, and finish a load of laundry before going to bed. But the most memorable piece was taking the dogs out for a last walk and finding a full moon so bright, we could see our shadows as we walked the vast lawn between the house and two barns with the sounds of cows stirring."

The kitchen has a range and full size fridge and freezer but there was no microwave but they had a 3-in-1 toaster oven, 3 cup coffee pot, and grill. Sink area with plenty of dishes and silverware. The bedroom with the queen size bed has one power outlet which is enough if you don’t need to plug in a lot of stuff. There were two tvs in the place. Plenty of extra bedding if needed. The cows were cute. It is next to a busy road so you have the noise from that and light from a street light shining in the bedroom window. Despite all that it was still worth it for us and we found it cute and cozy."

The cabin itself is quaint, comfortable and clean. From the surrounding hills to the sparkling stars above, the views are absolutely incredible here. We truly enjoyed disconnecting alongside nature and a crackling fire. Not to mention, it's on a horse farm so we actually took some riding lessons before checking out. I was anxious as a first-time rider, but our host, Nancy, made me feel more at ease and is just the sweetest soul!! We look forward to visiting again -- thank you for a lovely stay :)"

The cabin was new and clean - oh, and it DOES have air conditioning! I was cool and comfortable on a hot night. Even though it's a small and cozy space, I felt like I had plenty of room for my suitcase and belongings. The hosts provided a mini fridge (stocked with water bottles), snacks, a coffee maker, and coffee. The porch was lovely and I was encouraged to walk around to greet the horses and cows (which I did, happily!). As is advertised, the bathroom is 100 yards away, but it is brand new and I had no problem with it. The hosts provided all linens and basic toiletries. I was only their second guest, so I'm sure they are still getting into their airbnb groove, but I couldn't tell because they seemed like pros. I had a great experience and would love to go back sometime!"

I was in a last minute rush and didn't read the listing properly. The beautiful little cabin wasn't what I was expecting. (Literacy is importance, kids.)
No Wi-Fi? Strolls past horses to use the bathroom?
Turns out it was exactly what I needed during a very chaotic family visit. Beautiful view at sunset. Very comfy bed.
Nancy is incredibly kind and they respond very quickly to messages. Great snacks. Little creamer pods (instead of the powdered creamer usually reserved for guests you don't actually like).
Plus the horses are rad. When's the last time you hung out with a horse?"

The highlight is the kitchen! Not only is it large and perfect for group gatherings, it’s one of the best equipped kitchens I’ve ever seen for an Airbnb. This was very handy for us as we were visiting family in the area for thanksgiving. There was a large crockpot, serving dishes and platters, and even a bread machine. Everything you could imagine needing is available here.

It was perfect for our stay with friends and close to many beautiful sights like Ithaca and Watkins Glen, as well as Owega and Binghamton.
Cynthia is very communicative and gave easy to follow instructions. They even left us a treat. It was very sweet.
I loved our stay and have no complaints, just some heads up: the county well water has a sulfur smell which can be strong. Come knowing this for your showers and come prepared with spring water to drink. It’s not a big deal but definitely something to come prepared for.
If you’re looking for a cozy and private place this is a perfect spot. Thank you for a great space! If we’re ever back in the area, we will be back."

Stayed with a pet","Everything was great with this olace! Cynthia and Shannon communicated with me very fast when I had questions.
The place was like in dead end at first we were scared but it was okay, oh! And the stars while we were staying were beautiful! We went out and looked at the stars with kids!
Just one thing that was little hard for us to adjust was the water smell. It smelled like a rotten egg because of the sewer so we had to hold our breath to shower. Were just not used to the smell that is why. But since its an old house we understood that it could happen."

There, you can share code details to inform guest the use of last 4 digits from reservation’s phone number . That way guest can follow without the need to call."

Stayed with kids","The great service and attention started before we arrived and did not stop, even after we left. We loved our stay at Hickory Grove - Farm House Perfect. It actually was perfect for our family. The children enjoyed being able to play safely outside and my 5 year-old grandson kept wanting to sit in the field because he wanted to enjoy the ""biew."" He took photos with his iPad and even drew the skyline for us. We ranged in age from ""chronological adults"" to 2 years-old and everyone loved it.
The kitchen was well equipped and the rooms comfortable and the thoughtfulness and care of the owners was demonstrated in so many ways and appreciated throughout. The rooms and porches were comfortable and welcoming. I can't say enough good things about this home and the folks who own it.
As we drove out of the driveway, I heard the children through the windows saying, ""Bye, we'll see you next year!"" (I said it too.)"

Stayed with a pet","If you’re looking for a city getaway, look no further! This is your dream spot! We really enjoyed our stay at Cyndi’s. The house was very charming and spacious. The kitchen was well stocked with all essentials. The bathroom was cozy and warm. The beds and linens were super comfortable and clean to the point that we wanted to sleep in all day. We had the best communication with Shannon (Cyndi’s cohost) since Day 1 and throughout our stay. Shannon made herself available for us for anything we would need. She was kind, she checked in with us via text every morning. We swung by the city center of Owego as Shannon recommended. We unbelievably spent solid 4hrs in the gigantic antique mall there. Cyndi and Shannon were so considered. They welcomed us with a gift basket and a box of goodies that survived us the first night we arrived, after our 4hr drive. We loved the location of the house; it was away from neighbors and we felt like we had the world to ourselves. We ran outside with our Corgi pup and chased after him, we played in snow, and a lot more. The house had everything for everyone. High speed internet, smart TV and you name it. You won’t regret staying here. We will come again."

She enjoyed the farm tour and interactions with the animals very much. The place was huge, it is super quiet other than the noise of the heating system. It is such a nice change from the city life we live. Our dog enjoyed his stay too. Miss Hunter is very helpful, the best host ever."

Wonderful peaceful location, close to a nice creek. You can cross the creek and you get a hiking trail - we’ve seen a few deers there! It’s so peaceful and different from our day to day lives.
The house itself is fully equipped with EVERYTHING you may need on a vacation. With lots of vintage objects making this place so unique and authentic! Hunter has thought about every detail and even put a small gift to our kids ❤️.
Kids loved interacting with goats, the donkey and other animals.
At some point we’ve thought to cancel our plans and stay there for another few days."

Stayed a few nights","Hunters farm is one of the top places I have been to in the world. The farm is such a special place with the most beautiful surroundings and sweetest animals. What hunter is doing with her farm is an amazing feat carried on by the strength of her will. That is enough to make the trip to her farm worth it but on top of that she let my daughter and I help with all the animals, which is her happiest place. The farmhouse is so eclectic and well decorated we loved it! There is a bucolic babbling brook behind the house and a flock of cardinals were at the bird feeder in the morning. It was cold, snowy and still so lovely but the 2nd bedroom is not heated if cold be sure to ask for heaters and keep door open. If you want to use the jetted tub I would ask in advance it’s a process. It is a little house right off the road but I saw maybe three cars go by.Definitely one of my favorite stays we could be here forever and the town is very cute eat @MJ’s unforgettable with the best view of the river"

And the hundreds of acres of land all over was lovely for my dog to visit and just walk around in the morning and breathe some fresh air. Hunter also provided us with a lovely welcome basket with wine and other goodies. She also gave us a tour of her animals nearby (cows, ducks, etc.) and her horsey Prada who was beautiful.

Stayed with kids","We had a fantastic stay at Hunter's family farm! She is so warm and welcoming, and her family's farm and property are just full of charm. We felt right at home with everything we needed. We love historic homes and really enjoyed being surrounded by all of the built in features of Hunter's home, as well as her lovely and interesting antique furnishings. She even let our son get his piano practice in on one of her antique uprights. Communications with her were a breeze. She let us know ahead of time that cel. service is spotty as you near her property so we came prepared with screenshots of the check in instructions/door access code/WiFi - that was a huge help. Our 11 year old son loved playing in the creek every morning, I went for some great runs on the logging road on her property, and Hunter gave our whole family (including my parents whom we were in town to visit) a hands-on tour of the farm complete with opportunities to feed the animals and check out the old barn. Upon our arrival there was a huge gift basket filled with local treats, bath supplies, snacks and other goodies. That was a really nice touch that we appreciated and found really helpful. It was a very pleasant and easy drive into the town of Owego. We enjoyed it so much we will definitely stay there again on future visits, and my parents are going to recommend Hunter's place to other visiting family and friends. We also want to come back to hear about how Hunter's creative plans are going - she's quite the entrepreneurial, creative, Rennaissance women! If you're looking for a charming country place to stay in the area, look no further!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful visit at this awesome little farm in NY! The house is very comfortable, with all the amenities you could want or need. My visit was in March, and it snowed off an on the whole time I was there, but the accommodations were warm and cozy throughout. I'm sure the property is absolutely gorgeous in the spring and autumn as well!
The host was present to greet me when I arrived to answer any questions, and they were available if I had any issues during my stay. Otherwise, they gave me the space that I needed to enjoy my visit, and were respectful of my privacy.
The listing has tons of pictures, and I can say that the pictures are accurate. If you like what you see in the photos then you will not be disappointed when you arrive.
This bnb will be my first choice any time I am visiting in the area!"

The location was about 17 min from Owego, which was a comfortable distance from the house. We had a fun day sitting by the stream and going on a walk. Keep in mind though that full 200 acres isn’t accessible unless you put on your boots and do some trailblazing of your own. Thanks for a great time and the packed welcome basket. We hope to return someday!"

She was such a lovely host and we received welcome gifts!! She also gave us a full tour of the farm. We met all the farm animals, Prada and the cows! There were so many small adventures near the house and absurd breathtaking views. Especially on the full moon night!
Every corner of the house was meticulously arranged with so many antiques. We felt cozy, warmed and loved in the vintage setting.
Thank you Hunter and we wish to be back soon!"

We were looking for a quiet getaway from NYC and this property was perfect. We enjoyed watching the cows and meeting Prada the horse. The roomy rental is filled with unique antiques that all have a story. Hunter lives upstairs and works the farms, so she is usually never far away if you need anything. If you are looking for other things to do, the cute town of Owego is only 15min south and the bottom of the Finger Lakes are 30-45min north."

I’d recommend bringing water shoes for anyone that would like to go in the creek. The town of Owego is 20 minutes away and looked cute for shopping and dining. We’d definitely stay there again.

I especially loved the view from the kitchen sink - spring birds at the feeders and the glistening creek beyond. It was homey, quaint, and serene.

She also had a gift basket filled with local products and supplies for s’mores. Hunter introduced the kids to the cows and taught us so much about farming. We had a surprise April 1 snow fall and Hunter brought over a sled for the kids. The town of Owego is really charming with great restaurants with outdoor dining. We had a truly special week.

Quiet location (an occasional moo from the cows next door), there is plenty of land on which to roam, and it is by a pleasant stream with a small waterfall. The antique furniture in the house was neat to see. All beds comfy, the kitchen has everything you need, and wireless is good because there is no cell services in the area.

We were in town for a wedding and wish we had more time to explore and spend time on the property. We will definitely be back!

Stayed with a pet","We (me, my wife, and our puppy) loved staying at Tucked Inn over the Labor Day weekend, it was so peaceful, quiet, and relaxing. Our puppy loved jumping in the pond and swimming in it, the water was clear and clean. We also enjoyed a campfire the last night with some local friends.
We also got a tour of the property from Andrew, it was so cool to learn the history and their story.
There was a bunch of stuff in the fridge like eggs, milk, sauces, coffee, a coffee machine in the kitchen, cookie dough (so delicious), and tons of firewood for us to use."

Stayed a few nights","Andrew & Sally are SUPERHOSTS, anything we could want they were able to either provide or point us in the right direction. Their Maple Syrup is fabulous. They are so incredibly nice that you almost feel like family. Our dogs had a wonderful time. I spent some time fishing, a nibble or a catch with each cast. It was by far one of my most relaxing moments in more than a year. Every tool you’d need to bake, cook, grill, or toast marshmallows was there ready to use.
They left milk, eggs, syrup, cookie dough ready to bake, many condiments on the fridge, with pancake mix, oil, and no stuck sprays in the cabinet. Decaf and regular k-cups were ready for anytime.
The beds and couches were very comfortable. The chairs on the deck, off the sunroom were amazing, as we watched the sunsets and sunrises.
The pond looks spectacular,at night with the lights all around and better yet there weren’t any mosquitoes, considering how wet it’s been. We can’t wait for next year.

Stayed with a pet","We were looking for an Airbnb for a quiet weekend and Tucked Inn totally delivered! The home sits on a working farm with pasture and woodlands. Immediately behind the house are walking trails that the owners have created. They even provided a hand drawn map displaying the points of interest. We were so intrigued to see the taps in the maple trees and the network of hoses to collect the sap.
The weather was not the greatest the weekend we came. We brought food with us to prepare. You never know how equipped a kitchen in an Airbnb is going to be. This kitchen was the best equipped kitchen I’ve stayed in. There’s a 5 burner Samsung range that was up to the challenge. The hosts provided Viking cookware. There were plenty of mixing bowls, utensils, virtually anything you could possible need, even a Cuisinart stand mixer. Outside there is a Cuisinart 6 burner gas grill that was clean and easy to use. Comfy recliners in the living room and comfy bedding and thick towels. Highly recommend"

The owners were most friendly and gave us a tour of the trails in the woods. Ms Sally even sent hats and blankets for the cold weather that we unexpectedly experienced but having the tour while snowing, was an absolutely enchanting experience.
The cabin was pristine, with all that you might need during your stay.
If you are looking for a cozy but open environment, this home provides it well.
If you look outside at night, you’ll be sure to see many stars, a view that is rare in the city.
The land truly is stunning and great for hiking, even the dogs were amazed by such a beauty.

The experience from booking through check-in and check-out was smooth and welcoming. Before finalizing booking, I was notified of some ongoing work on the pond at the property. This allowed us to make an informed decision about the stay with no surprises. If you're looking for a lovely place to retreat to in the area, the space is inviting and well-equipped. Lots of quiet to enjoy and the fall views are spectacular. Our son and his family also enjoyed the special touch of chocolate chip cookie dough ready to bake. Really great hosts and location!"

Upon arrival, we loved the chalkboard sign that welcomed us, as well as the refrigerator that was stocked with fresh home-made chocolate chip cookie dough, farm fresh eggs, milk and pure maple syrup produced on the farm that is owned by our fantastic hosts, Andrew and Sally. They are located down the road from Tucked Inn and readily available to assist with any questions or concerns. We loved the RTV tour that they offer of their property, and the sweeping views of hills of Bradford & Susquehanna Counties. And as rural as the area is, the Tri-Cities (Binghamton-Johnson City-Endicott) of New York's Southern Tier are only 30-35 minutes away. Highly recommend!"

The place was well stocked with everything we needed and the large TV was great. We spent allot of time on the front porch enjoying the view. The trails were great to walk just out the back. Seen lots of deer. Can't forget how much we enjoyed the maple syrup, pancake mix, brown eggs, cookie dough and milk that was left there for us by the host."

Stayed about a week","Tucked Inn was a wonderful retreat to get away from it all. The house and property are well cared for. We spent lots of time on all 3 porches, preparing our meals and doing lots of baking in the great kitchen. The farm fresh goodies left in the fridge, including the chocolate chip cookie dough were savored. They even planted some cucumbers and tomatoes for guests to pick fresh. Sally and Andy are great hosts and we enjoyed a tour of the farm and getting to know them a bit. Clear instructions on how to use everything in the house. Great hiking right outside the back door. Stores for the staples a few miles down the road. I could go on and on. If you are looking for somewhere to just get away and relax with the world's sweetest hosts, Tucked Inn is the place!"

Having all the land to run around on was so great for kids. Our friends’ and family’s kids who came and visited didn’t want to leave when it was time to go home. A great gathering place.
The house is beautiful and clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed.
And a special shout out to Abigail and Tucker, two dogs from next door who visited us each day. They’re a bit excited at first, but they became a real highlight of our stay. Such friendly dogs!"

It is in a rural part of northern PA just south of the border with NY and only 10 minutes from local conveniences in Apalachin. The property is nice, surrounded by trees and on a hill with a great view. The house has plenty of seating and sleeping options, a large TV and fireplace to provide entertainment and sauna (didn't get to try that out). Access was a breeze and the hosts were extremely responsive via communication in the app, which was great. The kids and adults enjoyed it alike."

No matter rain or shine (we had a lot of rain on our visit) we still were able to do absolutely everything we wanted to do and had the best 5 days. Not to mention the Family is very welcoming and the dogs are very friendly and will accompany you on hikes in the woods!"

All of these words fit - and together, they describe what was a wonderful weekend getaway. From the warm communications with the owners, to the lovely touches of the kind of milk I liked stocked in the fridge with farm fresh eggs, coffee creamer, pure maple syrup from their farm, and homemade chocolate chip cookie dough in a container with instructions on the temp/time to bake them...Sally and Andy’s hospitality cannot be beat. This place has everything one could ever wish for and more. It snowed every day and the hikes around the property were lovely. Lots of deer and you could hear the wind through the pine trees. I can’t wait to return and thank Sally and Andy for being such wonderful hosts!"

Group trip","The house is rustic with a log cabin feel. Lots of exposed beams and big game on the walls. It is spacious well laid out, comfortably furnished, and has all the amenities, even WiFi and a game area in the garage. We loved the open plan kitchen/dining/living/loft area; it’s perfect for a family gathering. It sleeps 9 adults comfortably, making it well worth the cost. It is also very private, on top of a hill with nice views of fields, woods, and Sayre in the distance. Weather didn’t allow us to use the pool or hot tub, but they looked inviting.
The recommended road is a bit of a challenge, especially in bad weather or in the dark, though there is a better road once you know where to go (but you must watch for the kamikaze dogs!)
JoAnn is a perfect host: friendly and helpful when needed and invisible otherwise, even though she seems to live very close by.
Everyone in our group was very pleased and we would definitely return."

JoAnn and her brothers Scott and Steve were all wonderful and so friendly. We picked blueberries, watched some beautiful sunsets, went exploring and 4 wheeling through the woods while seeing some cool wildlife. Met some super sweet pups, played in the pool and relaxed in the hot tub. Giant bon fires, good food and family.
It seems the Beemans have thought of just about everything to make your vacation at their family home a fun and memorable experience.
Eight of us visited including kids ages 2, 6 & 8 and nana, 75, and we ALL had an equally wonderful time. Cannot say enough great things about this place, we will all recommend to anybody willing to listen. Driving home and the whole car is already asking to go back!

Stayed with kids","JoAnn's idyllic house sits at the top of a hill and has breathtaking sunsets.
We spent the week there for a family gathering and we had a lovely time. The kids had a blast using the pool and foosball table.
A very kind neighbor brought us freshly picked blueberries and the host was very responsive- including when we locked ourselves out of the house!
It's a place to relax and disconnect. If you need to stay digitally connected- as I had to due to some work related loose ends-  you may have to rely on your hotspot as Wifi connection is pretty intermittent. (there is reliable cable TV if you just need entertainment).
However if your plan is to disconnect from the hustle and bustle then the place is ideal to relax and soak up the pastoral landscape. "

Group trip","This place has a magical view and retains the charm of a large family home that was well planned and beautifully decorated. Pool and hot tub are great for kids and relaxing. Fully stocked bon fire big enough for a tribe to sit around. Loft with 3 bedrooms on 2nd floor and master suite on 1st. 3 bathrooms helpful with big group. Lots of amenities—full of coffee pods, a case of water, even alcohol under the bar. Joann stopped by with her two dogs and we enjoyed meeting them. Biggest thing to know is the drive up the hill to the home is long and steep and narrow…road is a dirt road. So first time get there in daylight."

It rained during our trip but we were able to enjoy board games, the ping pong table and of course the hot tub and the scenery was still gorgeous to view under the covered patio. We already have another group of friends looking to visit later this year because of how much we love it here and we will be back again next year!"

Group trip","first and foremost the description is truthful the driveway is intense. I arrived at night in a minivan and was a little freaked out climbing this huge off road mountain path through the woods and no civilization, I had aniexty... until I pulled up to the cabin and realized YOUR ON TOP OF THE VALLEY. it's absolutely gorgeous, literally took my breath away it was so beautiful. The house is placed perfectly with a gorgeous back drop view of the valley. IF YOU WANT SECLUSION THIS IS THE PLACE! Checked myself in with a key pad and went exploring. This house screams hosting family and that's exactly what I used it for. Myself and my adult sisters enjoyed the space so much. we actually live nearby but wanted a neutral space for a ""stay-cation"" this house was perfect. I'll rent again when the pool is open (stayed in April) there is a hot tub though which we loved and used but be mindful I stepped back to far at the hot tub deck as there wasnt a railing (also was a little tipsy) and fell."

The cabin itself is also beautiful, the pictures don't do it justice. The hosts are very kind and have thought of everything to make for a comfortablle and enjoyable vacation for their guests. The guys enjoyed the use of the kaboda to ride the trails and gather wood for their bonfires at night, the firepit is huge! Also, the stargazing was amazing up there as well! We had some 90 degree days and really enjoyed using the pool those days. We had such a nice time we wish we could've stayed longer. It was the peaceful relaxation we were looking for and we would definately stay again! Thank you Joann, Steve and Scott for your kind hospitality!"

Group trip","This is our 2nd stay here and every time we go we wind up bringing more and more people with us and still have a ton of room left over the house is big enough to host well over 50 people comfortably inside and outside you can have a 500 party easy That's how big it is this Is a 300 acre property with about I don't even know how many trails . they let you borrow the koboda I forget exactly what it's called But I think that's the name and We had a 20' fire. they Redid the garage added a ping pong table and Official foosball table (when We last stayed we were the 3rd person to actually stay there It's nice to see what was added and rearranged). the basement has some big arcade machine That Has pacman and galactica I think there's maybe 5 different games in there there's karaoke and a bunch of other stuff . They have 2 separate bars they have ample amounts of room. the Jacuzzi is off the wall. We had fun barbecuing all nights. Joanne and Steve are super friendly Scott helped us fix the heater for the poo.l We had so much fun and they are super nice. the property is amazing the views are breathtaking you can see at least 10 mountains from their hill, they have a restaurant where you can eat at if you would like . is it awesome They was an ice cream shop right there a great antique shop there's so much to do and see they have wild Life right up to the house We saw a frog rabbit hummingbird deer. The kids had a lot of fun as well And weren't bored at all. The dog had fun running around the property. Absolutely love all of the beds they were so comfortable and the new Carpet. There is also a hidden gem right over the hill and let me tell you it is amazing you can barbecue there they have swings there they have a bad swing they have a huge ponds where you can kayak you can fish so make sure you grab some Arsenals because they also have another pet actually and about the pond over the hill you will not be disappointed. You can walk it or you can just take the kobota right over. My friends want to rebook and my boyfriend and I would love to rebook in the fall as well."

As we drove up the long mountain dirt lane, surrounded by forest, we knew it was the perfect place for us. JoAnn was a super host who quickly responded to any questions we had. She even left us a welcome basket of fresh baked muffins that were tasty with morning coffee and tea. The furnishings were comfortable and the kitchen was equipped with most everything we needed to prepare family meals for our 3 night vacation. We enjoyed our evenings around the beautiful stone hearth wood stove with a glass front to watch the flickering flames. The hot tub was so nice. We enjoyed making gingerbread houses in the large dining area with the grandchildren. And walks on the property held beautiful views. We hope to return in warm weather to enjoy the pool and longer hikes with more of our family. And we look forward to time around the huge fire pit come warmer weather. We highly recommend this beautiful home for a quiet country stay with friends and family. Thankyou to the Beeman family for sharing your home!"

We walked into the the house to find a basket of homemade muffins and a welcome note. Joann was so quick with responses. Steve set up the fire pit. Plenty of wood for the indoor fireplace.

The road up to the cabin is a little intimidating especially if arriving at night, but if you just take it easy you’ll be fine. The ride up the mountain is totally worth it. Check in was a breeze. We were greeted by the Beeman family welcoming committee (a very sweet orange and white cat named Bob). Bob was a welcome visitor for the duration of our stay. We were provided with everything we needed for our stay and then some. Thank you Beemans for the delicious muffins!!! A great place to stay and a great value. We have family in the area and will most certainly look to book this listing again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We had the most magical stay at Joanne’s home. This was the perfect place to come and unwind for the week with our dog. We loved the hikes and the breathtaking scenery. Joann and her family are just so hospitable. We arrived to fresh baked cookies and a hand written card, and the experience only improved from there. Each element of the home felt designed to improve the experience as much as possible- from the outdoor dining and rocking chair set up, to the roofing choice that let just the right amount of light in when you are enjoying your outdoor hot tub experience. When we had trouble getting the fan to work, the family was super responsive, and talked us through fixing the problem. It’s clear that a lot of love and time have been poured into this place, and we were so lucky to be able to experience it.
Some things I don’t think have been mentioned before we came- the beds are super comfortable. We stayed in the downstairs king bed, which was a tempurpedic. We saw tons of wild life, including deer and even an eagle! There were blackberry bushes scattered along the trails, and the berries were in season! Stuck inside on a rainy day? There are tons of dvds and board games. The garage is a game room complete with a ping pong table and Mrs. Pac-Man set up!
I could probably also dedicate an entire paragraph to Bob, the resident cat. Bob seems to live in the garage, but will sneak insight the main house if you leave the door open (a welcome companion). I don’t think I have ever met a nicer, more gentle cat in my whole life. My puppy just loved him and Bob... well Bob was shockingly tolerant of his antics!
Just a few things to mention that were not cons, but things to consider. The wifi set up is actually a verizon jet pack hotspot, with a monthly data limit. We arrived on the 26th of the month, and there was no data available. We were able to use data on our phones, but it was spotty. Honestly, this was a great way to disconnect for me (and what a beautiful place to do it) but this amazing stay might not be your first pick if you need to -say- work remotely with internet access. One other small thing to note is that the grill could use a deep cleaning. We did what we could, but I’d recommend you keep an eye out to make sure none of the grease catches fire during use.
In all I’d rate our stay a 20/10. We (and our pup) can’t wait to go back!"

Stayed with kids",I’m hesitant to write my review because I wish I could hide this amazing home so that we can book it again and again but then I would be robbing other families of the opportunity to stay at the absolute best Airbnb! From the minute we arrived at the house we felt welcome and at home by fresh baked cookies chocolates and a hand written note from JoAnn followed by a big hello from Steve who was already working on the biggest firepit we have ever seen! The house was huge but cozy and the pictures don’t do it justice at all! From the huge bedrooms to the wet bar and balcony and patios it was an endless space for the kiddies to stretch out. It was well equipped for everything and anything with fully stocked cabinets of more pots pans utensils and gadgets than I have in my own home. Plenty of towels blankets washer dryer board games and movies galore! The hot tub was amazing and huge! Plenty of privacy but JoAnn Steve and Wendy were just a call or holler away if need anything but there was nothing to be needed. Getting a private atv tour from Steve of their massive property on the mountain was the highlight of our trip! A pond a creek tons of walking and riding trails and plenty of dogs to pet and even a cat that loves hugs made this place better than any stay at a resort. The Beemans are lucky and blessed to be able to have this place and give others the opportunity to make memories with families and friends. There is nothing they could have done to make our stay better and I just hope they decide to keep their home on Airbnb for many years to come because we will be a repeat visitor for sure and could see this being our family’s goto place for as long as they will let us!

The house is lovely and comfortable and we had a delightful time enjoying the great outdoors. How wonderful it was to be greeted by nature every day!!!. Our weekend stay gave us many memories to cherish. The house has many modern appliances and fully equipped to fulfill everyone’s needs. Sayre is a great place to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. Would love to go back in the nearby future."

The drive up the dirt driveway to the top of the hill is marked with little white signs to keep you motivated and let you know you’re on the right track. The exposed beams on the inside definitely give the home a rustic cabin vibe. The home is comfortable, the views stretch for miles, and the jacuzzi is quite relaxing. We would recommend driving the hour to nearby Seneca Lake to try some of the local vineyards."

We stayed in the winter and was not sure our family would keep busy but with so many activities at the house and property we ran out of time to do everything. We ended up packing some snowshoes and spent hours exploring the large property. The Beeman family is one of the most welcoming and friendliest families you will ever meet. So happy we found this posting, we would love to visit again."

(I think it’s helpful to note that the 4th bedroom is a loft open to the main living space below). The beds were incredibly comfortable and we enjoyed making meals in the well-stocked kitchen.
The property is absolutely gorgeous. We had so much fun playing in the snow, relaxing in the hot tub, and riding in the Kaboda! We never even turned on the TV, enjoying games at the kitchen table every night. It was a much-needed reprieve from screens, and family time we wouldn’t trade for anything.
Thanks JoAnn and Steve!"

Stayed with kids","I’m starting off by saying we are already looking at booking this house for July.
Such a friendly family, JoAnn was super communicative and Steven was so helpful and nice. We enjoyed talking to him and meeting his amazing dogs.
The house itself was perfect for our needs, sparklying clean, spacious, large open kitchen, beautiful firewood stove, plenty of space to relax, comfortable beds and bedrooms, all the linens and towels were fresh and clean. The house was equipped with EVERYTHING you may need.
We really enjoyed cooking and talking at the same time since the open and large kitchen is very conducive to this.
We LOVED the hut tub, which was already warm when we got there (so was the fire), after a warm hot tub hangout, make your way to the fireplace for a cozy nightcap, and in the morning enjoy the beautiful view off the kitchen while sipping some tea/coffee.
Steve also built a huge bonfire and we were able to get it going on our last full day, so much fun.
Our dogs really enjoyed exploring the woods and running around the open field with all the snow.
We had a beautiful and relaxing time in your wonderful property and are super excited to come back in the future.
Thank you JoAnn and Steven for sharing your family home with us. Thank you again for a wonderful time, we will be back!!!"

Stayed about a week","My partner and I are so grateful to JoAnn and her family for the opportunity to stay at their idyllic family cabin. As a fellow next-generation-family-home trustee, I really appreciate the fact that the Beeman siblings are doing all they can to keep the property in their family's name - and that we got to benefit from it. The property and the cabin are incredibly spacious. Visiting during the pandemic, it was a perfect place to get away from the city. Despite the fact that we only left the cabin to pick up provisions before a snow storm, we still felt like we had novelty in our experience every day. The wood burning stove was a particular highlight of our cozy stay, as well as the hot tub, which we got to enjoy as the snow fell around us. We were also so grateful to be able to bring our dogs with us for our stay. Living in a city, we need to be vigilant the second we walk out our door, with cars, people, and other dogs. Being able to let them outside and run freely immediately - I don't know that I have ever seen them so happy! Our puppy also got to experience his first snow at the cabin, which is a memory we will always cherish. We are very hopeful to return to the cabin in the future - and hope that as the pandemic ends we'll be able to bring some friends with us next time. Thank you for all of your assistance in facilitating a much-needed and very relaxing week away!"

There were pots and pans and all the cooking gear you’ll need. We didn’t want to leave! Our dog loved it and the cat in the garage was the sweetest boy ever!! He was nothing but love.

The house was alot bigger then the pictures and the loft was amazing all the lights worked and they had evvvwryrhing a house will need. And theres a cute cat in the garage a orange n white furry friend. The fire pit was the highwst ive ever seen. Joann gave us great tips and travel info very friendly and steve down the hill is hilarious and amazing. His dogs r so sweet and he accommodated our every need. We went to the town owego and you have to check out the early oswego antique store and the strip its on has amazing little eateries and cute shops...a real cute town feel... The salt jacuzzi was out of this world and so relaxing.. Worth the 4 and a half our drive from brooklyn ny . we celedlbrated our 2 year anniversary there n our 2 beat friends came n had an amazing time as well. House was warm n cozy... Loved late night game nights and fires loved the biiiiggg open field and loved the signs on the left side of the trees on the way up the mountain they were funny. By far one of the best trips and experiences.. Ty again.. We will book again...its so worth it!!!

The drive leading up to the house can be a little scary at first as it’s a bit steep but quickly got used to it and It was great coming back from a day of hiking and relaxing in the tub. Also the pup loved running around in the open field. It’s a huge piece of property up in the mountains, it can’t get more peaceful than that
Oh and there’s the sweetest cat that lives in the garage that we absolutely fell in love with.
Highly recommend JoAnn’s place."

Lots of taxidermy in the house which can be a little unsettling if you’re not used to it. The place has amazing amenities like a camp fire, pool, and hot tub. The cutest cat lives here that adores being petted too. Highly recommend this place!"

An extra 5 mi up from there (the dead end of Case rd). The cabin is clean and nice. There are only two things I wished I had known....If you have any sensitivities to scented detergents I recommend that you pack your own bedding....(the sheets were clean but they did smell heavy of “floral scent” softener). Also bring drinking water with you. Other than those two things it was fine and I highly recommend a stay here!

Stayed a few nights","The cozy country retreat was the post wedding retreat location my wife and I took right after our wedding, and it truly did not disappoint! Jana has cultivated a bird oasis right outside of the Airbnb unit (through the use of many flowers and birdhouses), and as lovers of all things outdoors, my wife and I were drawn to the many up-close avian visitors (house finches, golden finches, and hummingbirds!). In the mornings, we ate breakfast outside with the birds. In the evening, we put a fire on in the firepit (supplies provided) and sipped champagne that Jana gave to us! Jana also made a unique windowpane art piece in the outdoor space that commemorated our wedding day! At every turn, each and every little detail in the Airbnb unit was addressed by Jana, and our experience was simply delightful because of it. Truly a hidden gem.
(My wife and I also drove to downtown Owego to do the riverfront walk after getting dinner at Jackpot Ritchie's Chicken BBQ - definitely recommend!)"

They had so many little things that made it easy to stay there like a lighted parking spot that said “guest parking”, lights that make it so you can see to walk to the outside door, little welcoming signs, a binder of ideas for the area, throw blankets to use while watching tv, orange juice, eggs, and milk in the fridge, and even homemade soap that smelled wonderful!
The property is BEAUTIFUL! and very peaceful. The bed was comfortable. They have 2 recliners to relax in, which was perfect for my daughter and I.
My favorite was their chairs on the back patio where you can sit and look at their beautiful view, either in the sun or the shade.

She sent us local recommendations while we were there and was ready to answer any questions we had. I'm already planning my next trip to New York!! Jana, we can't thank you enough!!"

The interior is absolutely beautiful, charming and tastefully decorated. The bed is comfortable and easy to sleep because no noise. The outdoor terrace is large and offers many possibilities to enjoy the view, hares,deer, gardens and many birds. We particularly enjoyed being able to cook our meals on the barbecue and eat outside away from the rain surrounded by flowers and country decorations.

Attention to detail and beautiful touches were everywhere: original paintings, stained glass, small vases of yellow daisies, objets d’art on shelves, homemade soap in the bathroom. A lot of love went into creating this inviting place. The spacious kitchen was stocked with baskets of snacks, fixings for s’mores, and wine. The patio overlooking a lush green valley and surrounding hills was also thoughtfully arranged, with a fire pit, plentiful seating, fountain, and rustic yard decor like old wagon wheels that sparkled with fairy lights at night. The bird watching was phenomenal. As beautiful and comfortable as the apartment was, I was continually drawn to the patio. Jana and George were consummate hosts, just the right combination of checking on us for our needs, respecting our privacy, and offering suggestions for sightseeing and a special restaurant for our anniversary."

Jana is an outstanding host for whom nothing is too much, her warm welcome made us feel so comfortable and along with her husband George, they were so attentive to any of our needs or questions.
The property is furnished to the highest standard, a most comfortable bed, a great TV, two leather recliners, all the kitchen equipment you will need whether cooking in or just having breakfast.
The outside area is well equipped including access to homegrown tomatoes on the vine!! There is a fire pit with wood provided and very comfy chairs and loungers for outdoor eating and drinking.
The township of Owego is only 10minutes drive away where you will find a fine grocery store ( Price Chopper) and loads of restaurants. If you play golf make sure you go to En-Joie golf course in Endicott about 30 minutes drive.
Jana’s property cannot be over praised, it does not get any better than this, a true 5 star AirBnB.
Book this property you will not be disappointed."

The 1-br has a separate entrance from the main house and a private kitchen and bathroom. The bed is also very comfortable. There is tons of privacy but Jana also made sure to check in to know we have everything we need. She and her husband are such thoughtful hosts!

Stayed a few nights","Driving up Jana and George's driveway, you will immediately be in awe of their beautiful home, and upon turning around, you are greeted by a great view. This view can be enjoyed from the patio (with the added perk of a fire pit). Regardless of what you have planned during your trip, ensure you set aside time for a breakfast on the patio, and an evening of smores on the firepit...even if this means extending your stay for a day!
Jana and George truly go above and beyond to ensure their guests are comfortable and all needs are met. The welcome basket and cold beverages were greatly appreciated after a long drive and allowed us to unwind on the patio for a bit, rather than immediately heading to the grocery store.
Their place is cozy and homey, but modern and with some luxuries. Perfect combination to feel like you're at a home away from home while also feeling pampered!
Lastly, not only are Jana and George great hosts, but they are also great people. Conversation is easy, they are very thoughtful and considerate, and you can't help but feel like you're chatting with a family friend. They even sent us off with some fresh goodies from the garden!
If you are looking to stay near Owego, this is THE place to stay....highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is immaculate and tastefully furnished with a private entry leading out to a large patio area with views overlooking the rolling hills. We were there in the spring and the views were spectacular. Hopefully we can make it back this fall when the leaves are in full color. This is a great, quiet space away from city noise and light but it is well situated, close to Owego and a short drive to Ithica. Jana and her family went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. Jana provided recommendations, snacks and beverages, and even some firewood for the fire pit out front. She thought of every detail and checked in to make sure we were comfortable on several occasions. We loved getting to know Jana and her husband and look forward to our next stay."

Stayed a few nights","We had such a great stay at Cabin in the Clouds! The cabin has all the essentials. We brought a small propane camp stove which we found to be incredibly helpful to cook outside. A sharp knife and a couple of cooking utensils were of help to bring as well.
The double bed was extremely comfortable. And we were more than cozy with the space heaters. The complimentary firewood was a lovely addition. We found ourselves outside around the fire most nights. In the mornings and afternoons we got to watch the bluebirds
Even though the cabin is closer to the road, we rarely saw cars or people. It was a very private stay. We had pretty okay cell phone reception -- definitely enough to send and receive messages and make calls in case of emergency, even enough to stream some music.
For fun we traveled about an hour to hike Rickett's Glen, which was well worth the drive. Tons of amazing waterfalls. But go on the early side, as it gets crowded fast. If you're looking for the most simple perfect stay, this is it. We couldn't be happier with our experience!"

The property was great with all the wildlife and land to explore. We walked the trails, fished, sat by the fire and even took 2 day trips to the finger lakes area. Our pup loved being able to roam the property. I highly recommend a stay here....You won't regret it. My husband is already trying to find another long weekend to return."

There are a few good restaurants a short drive away in Sayre if you don’t want to cook in the cabin or grill on the deck. It’s also an easy drive to the PA Grand Canyon, Watkins Glen or other popular outdoor destinations."

We had a great time with clear skies, watching stars and lightning bugs we couldn’t count. So if you wanna a quiet city scape in a true secluded cabin, this is the place to go. The cabin is cozy and kitchen was equipped with all we needed to cook our own meals there. Sean was quick to reply and also gave us great local tips. We checked vineyards on the east side of seneca lake too. We’ll be back and wish we had a longer stay!"

It's the perfect blend of being somewhat close to society if you need to get something but still secluded for the perfect mix. The property I'd gorgeous, pictures didn't do this justice and they provided just about everything we could have needed except for food. (They had water, towels, soap, seasonings for food, a grill, everything!) We're strongly considering booking again and I'd recommend it easily!"

And I wish I could give more than 5 stars for the location along with other things!! The views were STUNNING... it was hard to take my eyes off the sweeping landscape, regardless of time of day! The cabin has ample and comfortable space for a family. And everything is there that you could possibly need (and the owners provide water which is such a nice and unexpected added touch!). The bathroom appears to have been renovated recently and was updated and clean. The space was just what we needed for a weekend of dog show activities during the day, and cooking out, roasting marshmallows and reading books at night. The hosts were very kind and the entire process was effortless. As the other guests mentioned, Sean met us nearby to show us the best way to the house and made sure we had everything we needed."

Sean and his family were waiting for us near the freeway exit to guide us to the cabin. Cabin is as shown in the photos. Cabin has a fully equipped kitchen. Rooms are not very big, but are comfortable for the stay as shown in the listing. Sean and Alan helped us till we settled down. we had only two issues during our stay - smell with hot water inside the kitchen and dampness odor inside the house. Another important note is to be careful at the corners of the cabin corners. It is a family friendly place and has all the facility away from all the hustle and bustle of city life. Thanks Sean and Alan for being the wonderful host and your place is just too good."

He also provided us with loads of information about nearby state parks with hiking, breweries, vineyards, and restaurants. The cabin was cozy and perfect for my group. The beds were a little older and squeaky, but we were so tired by the end of the day that it didn't stop any of us from sleeping well. The fridge was stocked with bottled water just in case we didn't want to drink the well water and we had full access to an outdoor grill and patio and even a chimnea. All in all, this rustic cabin holds a solid place between camping and staying at a hotel."

Stayed with a pet",Great stay! The house was clean and beds were comfortable. There was ample space for my family and my brother’s family to stay. Although old and ornate the home had all modern amenities you’d expect. The a/c units more than adequately keep the house cool. Jennifer is very responsive and has the house stocked with anything you would need. The Italian deli next door has all kinds of amazing food to order. We went for breakfast sandwiches and donuts. There’s a convenient store/gas station up the hill behind the house as well. And if you’re from the area and have a hankering for Pudgies it’s right around the corner! Would recommend and book this house again. Thanks!

I loved that there were plenty of pillows and towels, and boxes of tissues in most rooms.
The decor is restful, beautiful, and not cluttered.
It was super convenient to be located right behind the Dandy Mart and able to walk over to get any basic forgotten items /food supplies. Tops and Walmart are also approximately 10 minutes away if you have a long list of things you need."

The home was spotless, comfy, roomy, just a great rest on the road. She graciously extended the check out time so my husband could finish up work on zoom as well. And because it was especially hot, she ran brought us over a brand new fan for the one unairconditioned bedroom which made it very comfortable. Check in, parking and unloading was quick and easy. Also a great location, just a few minutes off 86 but a nice quiet town."

The accommodations were fabulous! The website was thorough, the photos are realistic and Jennifer did everything possible to make her Airbnb feel like our home.
The kitchen was labeled with everything you would need. The beds were comfortable. The home was newly renovated and very clean!
If we had a question, Jennifer would answer incredibly fast. We would recommend this Airbnb to anyone!"

It had a full kitchen equipped with whatever you’d need. It was the thoughtful touches that Jennifer did that was nice such as the organic eggs from her flock, and our fav creamer for our coffee. My kids made themselves right at home. For your convenience, there is a gas station literally right behind the apt and a Dandy Mini mart in case you’d need groceries etc. Also we went to Watkins Glen Falls which is 45 minutes from this apt."
