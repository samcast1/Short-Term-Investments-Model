Stayed one night","Our stay here was truly the most perfect airbnb experience. Not only was the home itself so beautiful, it was decorated with intention, with small touches like heated floors in the bathroom and dimmable lights throughout, it was so comfortable. Plenty of spots to sit with friends and talk, or just rest. The best vibe. We were in town for a concert at castle theater and it was very close by and the neighborhood felt safe for 3 girls.
The hosts were the best hosts I’ve ever had, they had the music from the band playing on an Alexa when we walked in, mood lighting in the living room, and ice, snacks, and refreshments available for us. We felt very taken care of.
They were also very accommodating when we asked for earlier check in since we had taken the early train in from Chicago.
I absolutely cannot recommend this place an enough! We will definitely return here next time we’re in town for a concert!"

Stayed a few nights","My sister and I were hesitant about the area but were amazed at how beautiful it was once we stepped inside their place. The decor was something both my sister and I are partial to (Black Beauty), it was like walking into a museum. We each had a bedroom, with a TV, which was very comfortable and spacious for unpacking. We were able to dine in the living room at the cutest table for 2. Although the couch was a little uncomfortable, we enjoyed the room's high ceilings and beautiful lighting. The deck was extremely inviting on a sunny day enjoying coffee and breakfast outside to a glass of wine in the afternoon. The walk downtown was a short distance for a little shopping or dining (a few store owners were friendly). We would stay here again while visiting family. Michelle & Mark were very responsive when I had a question. Thank you both again for our stay as it felt like home."

We have stayed at Mark & Michelle’s other Airbnb homes many times and so when their other place wasn’t available, we reached out. They kindly recommended their newest home to us. We were thrilled to stay at Black Beauty because we knew it would be super clean and that Mark & Michelle would be extremely responsive, should anything be needed. Thank you for hosting us once again! See you this summer for our next visit to Bloomington!

Stayed a few nights","The location and communication with the host were stellar! The home was well maintained and comfortable, while maintaining its historic build. It was nice to have such a walkable neighborhood for exercise and accessing nearby businesses.
If you’re looking for a place to work from, know that the desk area only had one available electrical outlet nearby and no nearby 3-prong outlets within reach. This presented a challenge for working and plugging up tech items, which were important to my stay.
Overall, I enjoyed being here and would book again for a work-free visit."

We thought there might potentially be a sound issue with it being on a street corner and sharing a lot with a bar, but not only does the bar close at 10pm, we did not have any problems with street traffic. It's a beautiful old building that felt cozy and unique and would happily stay there again. Thank you!"

Comfortable bed and chairs!! Lots of pillows for the bed....hooray! We were only there for the night so we didn't really cook, but the basics of plates, cups, glasses, silverware were there. We love places with character and this met that criteria. Will definitely return if we are in the area again."

The host was extremely friendly and very helpful and always ready to answer if I had any questions before and during our stay. The apartment itself is extremely clean. You could literally eat off of the floor. The decor in the home is beautiful. Bathroom was squeaky clean as well. The kitchen was an added nice touch even though we didn’t really use it. It’s very close to downtown and some restaurants. Very well lit easy to find and I felt very safe here. I will definitely be back to stay at this property again. The bed is so extremely comfortable that it has been the best night sleep I’ve had in months!!! if you were on the fence about renting an Airbnb you do not need to be worried about this place!!! If I could give more than five stars I would!!!

The decor was great and there were thoughtful touches especially in the kitchen. We liked being next to a bar and grill but also easily got downtown in both Bloomington and Normal. The neighborhood was pretty and we felt very safe. The building door was locked and the apartment door was locked as well- requiring one key and one code. The owners provided great instructions about building entry and also what the apartment included in terms of amenities. As soon as we arrived they checked on us to ask if all was ok. We were very happy with our choice."

Stayed about a week","Very helpful hosts and in a great location. Good space for work and a very comfortable bed. I enjoyed being able to walk next door to get a bite to eat at Schooner’s or pick up a pastry from Grove St Bakery first thing in the morning. I also really appreciated the clear expectations on quiet hours because there are long-term tenants in the building. I love Bloomington and this was a great spot where I could walk downtown or to adjacent neighborhoods to visit family, much more easily than if I had got a hotel room."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Sandy's place was a truly enjoyable experience. First and foremost, we would like to express appreciation to Sandy for her exceptional assistance throughout our stay. The house was so cute and we loved the dog toys set out and the dog bowls. The dogs loved playing in the backyard. Sandy was helpful and attentive, ensuring that all our needs were met promptly. She was very complimentary of how well we maintained the house, which made our stay all the more delightful.
While the house itself was impeccably clean and thoughtfully furnished, we did notice a slight hint of cigarette smoke upon entering. Possibly from previous renters? We are particularly sensitive due to allergies.
Despite this minor observation, we loved the house. It offered ample space and provided all the necessary amenities for a comfortable visit. Its convenient location allowed for easy access to nearby attractions and amenities, enhancing our overall experience."

Who would have thought that stocking scissors would make my day, but here we are.
The plants in her place were well kept and added to the beauty of her home.
There was a coffee bar, and I read the History of Bloomington book while I sipped my morning coffee, VERY relaxing!!
Sandy was also extremely gracious about me completely forgetting the checkout time. It was very much appreciated.
She doesn't have crazy rules, she keeps a clean and nice home, and she thinks of things to make her guests lives easier including a portfolio of menus for local restaurants and info on things to do around Bloomington (and scissors).
If you stay with her, then show your appreciation for her efforts by stripping beds, washing bedding or have it in the dryer, and having all your towels in the washer. I also took the trash out, had dishes in the dishwasher, and wiped down counters.
Thanks again Sandy!"

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my visit to Bloomington. The Stewart house was an excellent location! Near family, and within walking distance of Miller Park. I felt right at home at the Stewart house the moment I went through the door. My favorite room in the house was the sunroom. Full of light and plants and very comfortable. I was most impressed with the motion detector for the light in the bathroom. No fumbling around for the light switch in the middle of the night! I will stay at the Stewart house on my next visit to Bloomington. Thank you so much Sandy!"

Stayed with a pet","This was the first time I was traveling alone with two very large dogs (130lb and 80lb) which made the fence in yard priority for me. I have stayed at many airbnbs before and she made me and my dogs feel so welcome... I was also very comfortable and not obsessively concerned about dog hair being left behind.
I am not very tech-savvy. She left very clear and instructions for the TV. (For which I am grateful because I would have probably not been able to do that on my own. 😆)
She has a lovely home and a wonderful sunroom!!! 🪴
My daughter met up with me there and we enjoyed our stay very much! Kitchen was very functional and we made several meals together.
Our visit was mostly to catch up and hang out.... We really didn't leave the house much so I can't say much about the area. I had no concerns for safety though.
We loved the large bathroom. (I could not get the bathtub drain plug to hold water so I just improvised.)
Thanks for the lovely time!

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Sandy's place for four nights. The communication was polite and fast.
The (entire) house is in a very quite area of Bloomington. There is an auto shop in front of the house. But it was closed or quite the whole time. The accommodation comes with a large parking spot in front of the garage, which wasn't able to use.
Inside everything is a little old but it instantly felt comfy.
The downside was the hair on couch, kitchen and in the bathroom. Also the microwave was super dirty and the buttons were sticky.
A big(!) plus for the good internet and the nice TV with a lot of channels and streaming services."

Stayed with a pet","This place is GREAT! Four minutes from Grossinger Motors Arena. It's the perfect place to stay for IHSA State and ISU events. Sandy is very responsive. The house is huge and is very clean. It has a cute sunroom with a fireplace (with a heater insert). The kitchen is FULLY stocked. The bathroom is large. It has great water pressure and lots of hot water. The mattress is a memory foam pillowtop. We slept great. Donut the Wonder Beagle loved the backyard. We kept him on a leash just in case he could find an escape route. Lots of parking on the driveway and on the street. Sandy thoughtfully provided a dog food bowl, water bowl, toys, and a cage in case we had problems with our cage. We saved approximately $400 by staying at Sandy's place instead of a hotel and using the kitchen. It's in a very safe, quiet neighborhood. We will definitely be back."

Stayed with a pet","Of the many AirBnB's I've stayed in, Sandy's preparation for guests demonstrated the most thoughtfulness. Everything from instructions on working the TV to the single-serve hygiene products in the bathroom to the nice welcome note.
The location was easy to find and close to downtown Bloomington as well as to Veteran's Parkway. Both locations offer great places to eat, shop, etc.
Not just clean but ""comfortable"". I felt right at home. I could LIVE in the sunroom!!! So relaxing!
I was able to work remotely thanks to the easy connection to wifi.
I have a dog with extreme separation anxiety. It's really difficult to leave him behind when I travel. Thanks to Sandy's pet policy, I didn't have to. He enjoyed the visit as much as I did.
It's clear Sandy is invested in guests having the BEST experience. And I did...and would visit Sandy's place again in a heartbeat!"

This is clearly a home where the hosts invested significantly and with care. And ""home"" is the accurate term. I immediately felt relaxed and welcomed with the considerable thoughtful touches.
It's a safe, lovely neighborhood, centrally located, with easy access to shopping, dining, etc.
I immediately recognized the scent of a clean house which is very nice considering I never experience that in my own home! 🙂
I'm grateful the host permitted my dog to stay as he enjoyed exploring the big backyard and neighborhood."

Stayed with a pet","Kevin’s place was as described on the pictures and the location was 15 min away from University area. The only reason I’m giving this place a 5 starts is because:
1. The host asked under additional request to start a load of laundry. Even tho we paid for cleaning fees. When I asked he responded they usually get behind with this and they ask the guest to start the laundry for them. Be aware of this requirement since you will need to make extra time to complete the request before checking out.
2. After removing the pillows liners we realized that the pillows had a lot of dog hair sticking to it (short black dog hair). This can be an issue for people with allergies. We literally sleep holding pillows with somebody’s dog hair and stained pillows. Not my dogs hair (my dog has long hair and he doesn’t shed - he is a Japanese Chin hypoallergenic).
3. The towels provided looked very used/old. Bring your own towels. Shower towels should look in a good condition. They needed to be replaced."

Jessica was very clear about the parking but I’m not gonna lie, Bloomington has extremely difficult to decipher and strict parking rules. I got 3 tickets during my 5 night stay, but the tickets were $10/ea ($30 total) so I just paid it online. Frankly the tickets are cheaper than most parking lots.
Bathroom was solid and everything worked. If you’re there for First Friday you’ll have a blast checking out all the art studios."

Stayed a few nights","This place was so good I wish Airbnb had a ""Better than 5 Star"" rating. Very clean, very comfortable, and incredibly convenient.
First of all, if you're coming to Bloomington for a show at The Castle, just stop looking and book this place right now before someone else does. It's such a quick walk to the venue and to all the great bars, restaurants, shops, and cafes downtown. I was here with friends for a show at The Castle, but when it ended they had to drive back to their hotels in the outlying areas and all I had to do was take a nice stroll back to the loft. The parking is very convenient less than a block away and I loved exploring the area.
And if you do want to check out the breweries and shops and restaurants around town and in Normal (and you should), it's a very easy drive.
This is a gem--I can't recommend it highly enough."

My only concern is the white carpet which looks nice but doesn’t seem practical for guests coming and going. I got tired of taking my shoes off and on every time I entered the apartment. Otherwise a fantastic place to stay.

Cool skylight gives great natural light.
Bathroom is small but workable with a sweet massaging shower head.

Stayed a few nights","The Loft is the perfect spot for a cute stay in Downtown Bloomington! It is centrally located to all the action and you are steps away from the charming downtown scene. The loft itself was very warm and welcoming, and was just right for two people. I recommend stocking up on some groceries/supplies because while Downtown Bloomington does offer several places to eat, the scene can be a bit quiet on weekends and late at night. The loft has a fridge and microwave, so you’ll be set having a place to keep and reheat tasty leftovers and midnight snacks. Fortunately, you are less than a mile walk away from a Wal-Greens and other shops.
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and the Loft was the cherry on top of a wonderful weekend. Our trip was made all the better by Jessica! She is very friendly and responsive, so you are in very good hands with her.
If you’re looking to stay in Downtown Bloomington, book the loft and enjoy a charming downtown scene with tasty food and friendly neighbors."

Stayed over a week","The street the BnB is on is a little sketchy.. upon arriving I was asked for money and people sleep in the parking garage. However it is only a block away from Main Street with a fabulous little bakery called Ivy Lane and awesome food at Reality Bites.
The temperature is super inconsistent, but it adjusts pretty quickly.
Be prepared the fridge/freezer is a little small.
The loft area is amazing. The bed was comfortable. The desk was great to work from and had such a cute light. The closet had a lot of space. There is a collection of games, but no table to really play on.
Jessica made up for any negatives. She was extremely responsive and super attentive to our needs. Offered to clean, restock and exchange towels during our stay. This was amazing and I have never had this prior at a BnB."

In addition I would say the space is child friendly too!!

It even had a bonus room with bean bags to play games in the TV. We enjoyed a nice cup of coffee from the assortment in the Kuirig. The dart board, air hockey and ping pong table was a blast with the family. Thanks for hosting us in your beauty home. We'll be back when in town with the family."

Stayed one night",This house was steps away from IWU. Very nicely furnished. Was nice to have a half bath downstairs and the upstairs bathroom was very roomy and newly renovated. Living room couch was very comfy. Kitchen stocked nicely with supplies to cook and eat. Hosts were very responsive and accommodated a very early check in for us since we arrived in Chicago at 5:30 am that day. I would highly recommend this house to anyone wanting to stay near IWU!

Nice touches included separate dog towels for muddy paws, a supply of snacks, water and coffee, and best of all: the recommendation for Rosie's restaurant! A quick 6min drive for a delicious dinner. The neighborhood was quiet, perfect for walking.
The only thing short of a 5-star review is the (queen) bed which was maybe a little older, and tough for our older bodies to sleep soundly on. Probably not an issue for younger travelers, though!"

The bathroom was stocked with all of your basic amenities and had heated floors. This place was very spacious and even had a basement with a washer and dryer. The host were very responsive and the directions for check-in and check-out were very clear. The fridge was stocked with water and soda. There were snacks and other kitchen amenities provided for you to enjoy. I did appreciate that everything was labeled for easy access. I didn’t get a chance to enjoy the backyard but it would be a great area to relax and enjoy the outdoors. I would highly recommend campus cottage to others. Thanks again Mark and Michelle for a great stay! I felt right at home and will for sure book again in the future.

Mark and Michelle's place was super cute with so many great touches! It was exceptionally clean and organized (including closets, etc. labeled so it was easy to find whatever you needed). There was no clutter and it was decorated very nicely. The communication was great and information provided ahead of time with pictures of where to park was very helpful. We will definitely be back when we're visiting our son at ISU and would highly recommend it!"

For example, I was going to make coffee and at first couldn’t find the k cups. Then I see a label next to the keurig that literally says “k cups are on the wall behind you.” 😅 amazing! Also, can’t forget to mention the bathroom! Heated floors and a lighted sink- fancy! Definitely will try to stay here every time we visit Bloomington-Normal!"

It was comfy and cozy and close to EVERYTHING! It was wonderful walking around ISU campus and eating in the awesome downtown restaurants! We really enjoyed our stay. The only problem…… we didn’t want to leave!!"

Campus Cottage is equipped with all the necessities you need and SO much more.
Mark & Michelle go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible, including for your pet.
Instead of staying at a hotel, try the Campus Cottage...You will definitely not be disappointed. A true gem!"

Stayed one night","Mark and Michelle did an amazing job on this perfect little cottage! Although it’s not large, it is not lacking in any creature comforts. From the cozy bedrooms, stylish decor, and beautiful lighting to the complimentary snacks (there are so many to choose from), various flavors of Keurig cups and even cold drinks in the refrigerator this place has it ALL! I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful heated floor in the bathroom as well. I just can’t say enough about this place! I did hear the foot traffic mentioned in the description, but it wasn’t that bad and didn’t go on too late. I just turned on my white noise app on my phone when I went to bed just in case. Can’t wait for a reason to return!"

Greg was also one of the best hosts I’ve had with air bnb. He was very quick to respond and checked to make sure check in and the place met expectations. When we first got there (relatively late at night), the fire alarm was chirping from a low battery. I messaged Greg to let him know and within 10 minutes or so, he had taken care of the issue. This is a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place in Bloomington."

Stayed with kids",The place was beautiful and better than expected. It was very clean. Communication was easy and they checked to make sure everything was good after our arrival. The door has an electronic lock with code and it was super easy to let ourselves in. Wifi information was provided in a convenient location inside so our kid didn't have to bug us for the information. They provided extra blankets which came in handy with the cold weather. We are from Florida and not used to such low temperatures. It was easy and quick to warm the space. There were smart tvs there that we could use our own streaming services on. The beds were very big and comfortable. The place was decorated so well that we took notes for our own house. We loved the artwork and decorations. We didn't need to rent a car (we flew in) because everything is in walking distance. It was great! We will definitely use this host in the future.

Stayed one night","My friends and I were in town for a concert at the Castle Theater and wanted to find something that was walkable. Not only is this location walkable, it also neighbors a great local bar and restaurant.
Greg and Celeste are experts in hospitality. From their proactive and friendly communication to their dedication to ensuring we had an excellent visit, I feel that this exceeded the hospitality of many hotels. Getting in the space was a breeze and it didn’t feel like we were responsible for a bunch of chores upon leaving as with many properties.
As far as the property itself, it exceeded all expectations. This is one of the few times where what you see in the photos is what you get in person. The photos show a pristine, modern, luxurious space. Unlike other bnb experiences, it was as clean and fresh as advertised. This made for such a comfortable stay and it’s too bad we didn’t stay longer. There is beautiful decor, state of the art appliances, and cozy bed linens. Highly recommend!!"

The apartment is exactly like the pictures. It was clean right down to the sparkling silverware. Has taller ceilings with two king beds. The bed with the big columns/posts is firm and the one with the grey cover was like sinking into a cloud! Big tv's, wide reclining sectional, fancy/modern appliances, mix between ultra modern and charming old victorian style. Fluffy towels, incredibly soft blankets and sheets, coffee bar. I honestly thought for the price I paid that I would get there and something would be wrong.. but it was perfect."

They’ve kept some of the original charm with some of the hardwood floors, beautiful fireplaces and hearths. This place is beautifully decorated, updated appliances and amenities. It was next door to a great place to eat and socialize. A little street noise because it’s on a corner but not enough to bother us at all. We had issues figuring out the tv’s. But that nothing to complain about. It’s a great place, the price was more than reasonable. They have it listed as a “Luxury Apartment” and it was. Better than a hotel for sure. Our hosts were pleasant and more than ready to help."

Stayed one night","This was our first experience with an AirBnB, and if they're all like this, we'll never stay in a hotel again. We were walking distance from the downtown. The apartment is in excellent condition and has a nice layout. It is well-furnished with new appliances, a nice bed, and so many little extras it was like family set it up for us. It also has a very fun theme with many cute little touches and an Alexa for music. So easy to get there and get inside. It was also very easy to work with Mark and Michelle (even though we were probably annoying as first-timers). I had a question about the central air control after we arrived and got an IMMEDIATE response. (Also, the AC is very nice -- kept the temp perfectly throughout the apartment and was whisper quiet) The neighbors were very quiet too, or else it's just got great walls. We didn't here a peep the entire time. It was very comfortable and relaxing. Can't wait to stay again!"

Stayed one night","I absolutely LOVED this spot!
Pulling up, the neighborhood was dark and seemed sketchy. I also had a hard time seeing the apartment number, but all of these things were more of a ""me"" problem because I arrived later than anticipated. Had it been daytime, my perspective may have been different
The parking space and apartment number were very clear and helpful. The apartment space itself was very absolutely adorable! The layout was very open and spacious. It was very clean. The theme was on point, and the little messages from the hosts had me smiling.
I loved that the TVs were set to welcome me and that the hosts included snacks and drinks. It just felt good. I am disappointed that I had a very limited time there and hope to find another reason to visit with my partner and son.
I've never stayed in an AirBnB before, and these hosts set the bar extra high."

Stayed a few nights","This was my first AirBnb ever. I only had 2 issues (both dealing with the keyless lock, my first time using one) and the hosts responded immediately.
The place was immaculate, true to online photos and location is perfect. Everything is a 10 minute drive. Franklin Park is within walking distance.
I grew up in Bloomington, moved away 25 years ago, to Florida. I remember this house and always loved it. I came back to sprinkle my brothers ashes near our moms grave. He was killed in a bicycle/vehicle accident in Florida.
I needed peace, this place was perfect.
I had a couple friends pick me up and they wanted a tour. They loved it as well.
Bloomington is a hidden gem. People are kind and genuine. Lots of great spots to eat.
And now, this awesome airBnb. I will definitely rebook as I do come back quite often.
Thank you to my hosts.
Your little gem of a unit is absolutely quaint, cutely styled and peaceful."

The ENTIRE rental was decked out in movie themed decor. Examples include posters of pulp fiction, a Jaws shower curtain, and a stage light accent piece!
Everything in the rental was clearly labeled, whether it be the remotes that turned on colored LED's above the kitchen and behind the TV, or the laundry closet where guests can place their dirty towels.
We as guests felt safe and at home the entire stay as we were provided with a private parking spot in a quiet neighborhood, and a passcode deadbolt at the front door.

The apt was quite large, and the separate bedroom quite roomy. It was nice to have little snacks, and they had a yoga mat (a nice Gaiam one, I might add) available after I inquired. The porch was nice for sitting and having coffee or take-out. There was a mixup one day with parking onsite, but there is plenty of parking on the residential street, so it wasn't a problem.
