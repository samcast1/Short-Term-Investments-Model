The updated kitchen and bathrooms ensured all our comforts were met, while the historic details left in the home made it a unique and wonderful stay. The home was clean and very comfortable and the location could not be beat. We have already booked our next stay! Highly recommend."

The home is a well maintained old home in historical district. So, it is a bit drafty. But, host has plenty of heating. Each of the bedrooms have a wall heating unit to ensure you stay cozy.
Lovely place. Would stay again!"

Bathroom with an amazing soaker tub that I sadly didn’t have time to try. Super comfy bed and big living room perfect for watching a movie. Already looking forward to returning next year!"

Stayed with a pet","This cozy home seems to have been recently renovated, and they did such a great job with it. They maintained the historic character, while updating the bathrooms and kitchen, and windows. It is very clean, beautifully decorated, and was specially themed with fall decor. This is a beautiful property! And it had everything we needed.
The space was perfect to have my college student and her two friends come hang out for pizza, TV and lots of laughs.
One thing to note, the small fenced back yard is fenced with portable, lower fence panels (maybe 3'?), so if you bring a dog that is a jumper that would be one thing to consider. Our two large dogs didn't challenge it."

Kenyon College (which we were visiting). The two bedroom cottage is very well appointed for guests and immaculately clean. You can tell that the hosts have pride of ownership - down to the seasonal fall decorations in the main living area. Highly recommend for others planning a visit to Kenyon College."

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved this location in Mount Vernon, beautiful setting in the historic district, close to downtown, walkable to many restaurants and if you get a chance to visit the dog fountain, it’s our favorite. This house was clearly a love of labor as you can tell it’s an older home and has been restored and renovated with the most incredible features and updates for today’s renters. Beautiful restored original hardwood floors, they saved old school details such as exposed brick and hardwood plus molding throughout but also added amazing modern features and the comfort level is incredible. I absolutely loved the old doors and original handles restored to their natural look. The bathroom with soaking tub was exquisite. The front porch is a perfect place to relax and enjoy your morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. We also loved all the puppies in the neighborhood. I could go on but do yourself a favor and book a stay, it’s amazing."

It would have been nice to have blackout curtains/blinds on that level especially when making your way to the bathroom at night. This is not a dealbreaker, however, and we would most definitely stay here again when we come back to the area. Thanks for everything, Heidi!"

The house is beautiful and very comfortable. We made a simple dinner and found everything we needed in the kitchen. There's a pleasant backyard space, too.

Would have been helpful to know the only bathroom wasn’t on the bedroom floor but that wasn’t too problematic. We took advantage of the fire pit which we enjoyed. Nice little closed in back yard. The food we had in town was awesome. Mount Vernon is such a great little town. Would defectively recommend The Blue Bell Inn.

Stayed a few nights","The Bluebell inn was absolutely beautiful. walking into the house we were greeted with a personal written card, a bottle of wine, and snacks. they had the fridge stocked with water and snacks as well. the bathroom had extra toiletries and things needed. the house can get a little hot during the day in summer time with Ohio weather but the hosts have even placed really nice coolers throughout the house. you can tell they have put lots of love and money into the place. they have a book of things to do in the area and the host always responds! we were in Mount Vernon for inkcarceration and making the drive to Mansfield everyday. if you want to book this place for ink next year you're gonna have to beat me to it! That's how perfect it was. The bluebell was the best, quiet, place to settle after a long day in the sun. don't hesitate to book it I promise you will love it."

Stayed with kids","The Bluebell Inn is definitely worth a visit. We stayed for a long weekend for our kids’ swim meet, and immediately felt right at home. The house itself is adorable, and we loved how they’d “branded” the Inn throughout, and included lots of cool vintage Ohio items.
Also, they’d put out wine, local candy, granola bars, and other snacks. Huge win when you walk in and are greeted with immediate snacks!
Heidi was incredibly proactive and responsive - communication was a breeze.
And if you’re wondering whether the couch can really count as a 3rd bed… yes. It’s huge, and remarkably comfortable.
All in all, we loved the stay. We’ll 100% look to book again when we’re back in Mount Vernon."

The home was super clean and had extra amenities like make up wipes and face wash in the bathroom. She also provided local coffees and teas.
The beds are memory foam I believe. At first it was super firm but slowly you sink in and it forms to your body. I’d never slept on a mattress like that before! I slept great.
Heidi recommended the Alcove for dinner and it was delicious! It was only a ten minute walk from the house.
Overall, a 10/10 stay. We loved the Bluebell Inn. Specifically hanging in the living room, chatting, and snacking. Thank you Heidi! ✨😊"

Beds where extremely comfortable with plenty of extra blankets to use. Only thing I would add as a con would be having shades in the front room for the window and the stained door. Had a couple of kids walking through and looking in there. So adding a little more privacy in the front room I would have stayed down stairs on the pull out for easy access to the bathroom but didn’t feel comfortable with people able to look in. Other then that I gave Heidi’s place 5 Stars!!!!!

Heidi was extremely accommodating with a late check out request and was very quick to respond to messages. We had the whole house to ourselves, with a washer and dryer, full kitchen, and super cute dining area.

Stayed a few nights","Kelly had a great house in a great location. There was a lot of room for our family, and there were 2.5 bathrooms. This was exactly what we needed. Downtown was a short walk in a nice, historic neighborhood. We were able to spend time downtown with family and friends without driving. There were many fun restaurants and coffee houses within that short walk downtown.
We will definitely use her place again in the future."

It’s architecture is beautiful and is much more spacious than you would expect from the pictures and from the outside of the house. Plenty of room for 3 adults and 5 children. Exceptionally clean and inviting. 3 bathrooms were a plus. You can tell that Kelly loves this home which is fully modern but has also kept the charm of the original woodwork. Little extra touches all around the house made us feel welcome and we enjoyed our stay immensely.
Within a 10 minute drive of grocery stores and within walking distance to the downtown area. Parks nearby are well kept so it is a nice location too.

Stayed one night","Kelly went to great lengths to provide an exceptional stay! From the timely and accurate communication throughout the process, the ease of check-in, the informative welcome binder, the beautiful and well-stocked kitchen, all bath necessities, very reliable and fast internet service, and the many thoughtful touches like snacks/treats, hot chocolate, tea and coffee, it is evident that she truly cares about ensuring for guest happiness. The home itself is quite a bit larger than we anticipated and can easily accommodate a good size family. It has the most amazing woodwork and is full of character and warmth! The dining room table was the perfect size for playing games. Although weather prevented us from doing so, downtown Mt. Vernon is within walking distance. The short and easy drive to Kenyon College was greatly appreciated. Thank you again for a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning!"

Living room and dining area also very comfy with lots of seating, large TV and many, many games. Outside backyard is a lovely oasis with furniture and trendy lights. Thanks for the great stay!

The house is so welcoming and comfortable. I usually have trouble falling asleep the first night or 2 while on vacation, but this is never an issue here. The bed is just so comfortable. Our trips to Ohio are to visit family, and Jim and Jodi make sure to include activities and essentials to make things easier and fun for our young grandson who loves going to “Gigi and Pop’s house”. The house is conveniently located close to most of what you would want to do in Mt Vernon, but is on a quiet and peaceful street. Welcome Stay is our favorite Air B&B, and Jim and Jodi are the best hosts you will find. Kimberley Peto"

He was there to allow my husband and mother to check in early while we were out riding. The patio was private and quiet and a great spot to recharge.

We had the entire place to ourselves and felt right at home within the first 5 min of being there! It's 100 years old; it has a quaint, vintage feel to it, full of modern amenities that brought the past & present together to offer comfort and security! We slept so well, the showers were great, his laundry machines were a lifesaver and his couches & kitchen were used happily! He had a great welcome note for our family and a folder full of info and local recommendations that we really appreciated. The snacks and coffee options were the cherry on top, along with the laundry soap and bathroom items he supplied. It was an amazing stay, and we are big fans of his place! Thank you, Jim!"

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting Mount Vernon for the Easter weekend to spend some time with our daughter (a Kenyon student): this charming, clean, cozy, beautifully equipped home was the perfect place to enjoy a family holiday. Jim and Jodi have thought of everything--from snacks and coffee (for the Keurig) in the kitchen to little baskets with toiletries in the bathrooms in case you've forgotten anything. Our hosts suggested taking a hike at Honey Run Falls--which we did--and then we returned to make dinner (my husband had so much fun with the electric can opener I feared he was going to open every can we had) and play board games at the big family table. I even snuck in some writing time in the peaceful office one morning, and I have to say, the actual bunny rabbit who visited the yard was a nice touch. Our daughter's a first-year student, so we'll definitely be making this our home away from home! Thank you."

Stayed one night","The house was just incredible! Very spacious, clean, and had lots of character. We really enjoyed all of the little extra thought that went into setting the house up for guests- clear labels, extra supplies and snacks, bedside coasters and alarm clocks, etc. On top of that, Jim was very kind and quick to respond. We had to make a last minute booking due to our previously-booked rental cancelling the day of our stay. Welcome Stay was so amazing, we ended up so grateful that we got to stay there instead. Very short drive to Kenyon College/Gambier."

Our group consisted of grandparents, parents, and a 2 year old. Knowing this, Jim put out some toys, high chair, and a pack and play for our use. My mother made a big family dinner, and everything she could have needed was there. My brother came in from Columbus and we shared a 3-course meal like old days.
Beds were comfy, lots of extra pillows, great water pressure and the towels were so fluffy! Mom again made breakfast and grandpa and I took the little one for a nice walk to Mount Vernon downtown. The neighborhood is gorgeous and historic, and everyone was so friendly. There was a farmers market at public square, and we picked up a wildflower bouquet for Alise/grandma. Stopped at the happy bean coffee shop, and saw the dog foundation on our way back.
It was only one night but we had such a good time with our family. I also fell in looooove with the town of Mount Vernon. Wonderful breweries and restaurants in the area…I really can’t wait to come back. Cheers to a wonderful stay and a great host! Thanks again."

Everything in Jim's description of the property was accurate. Mount Vernon is a charming town, and the home is located in the Historic section. Many beautiful homes with period details, brick roads, huge front porches, we took many walks in the morning and in the evening just to take it all in. The house is a comfortable, spacious, 4 square design with high ceilings, and ample rooms. Beds are very comfortable, a million little details all thought out in advance, notes on the area, info on attractions, brochures..etc..Jim has thought of everything. The home is meticulously clean and it truly felt like we were staying at a relative's home! Games for the kids, charming outdoor patio with hanging bistro lights. Full size washer and dryer, dishwasher..fully stocked kitchen, and a very attentive and thoughtful host.
We will be staying here again!! Thank you Jim for a wonderful stay in Mount Vernon!"

The house, in general, was amazingly clean, enough for us to walk around barefoot. However, we felt that the downstairs bathroom could have been cleaner. That said, it's so negligible compared to all the good that's going on - it's definitely one of the best places we've stayed.

Personalized stocking filled with local favorites and treats galore, a fully stocked Keurig station, a snack station, water, fruit and drinks filled the fridge. I've stayed in many rental homes and I've also rented our home out too. I have to say, this home is above and beyond any place. It will always have a special place in our hearts because my dad passed in May and my mom needed to be with family...so we rented this home.

Stayed with kids","We absolutely LOVED our stay in Mt. Vernon and this home. Every detail was attended to, down to hot chocolate and cups to enjoy it in. They even decorated for Christmas! We felt right at home. It is in the Historic District with plenty of beautiful homes to enjoy when walking through the neighborhood. Close to so many conveniences. Ariel Park is a must visit. The home was super clean, amenities in kitchen were great, fridge was stocked with yogurts and drinks, beds were comfortable, plenty of extra blankets, and games. All in all, one of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in! Our grandson called it his vacation home and wanted to stay longer!"

Group trip","I’m a picky traveler and I can say after staying here in November 2021 that this is a no hesitation AirBnB. It has been newly refurbished and updated with fresh paint, new furniture, soft towels, great bedding, and is immaculately clean. There are so many thoughtful touches and amenities for a traveler. You can tell by owner Jim’s quick exchanges and eagerness to help that managing this place is a natural skill and passion of his. Believe the other reviews, you won’t be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","This was honestly the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The house was beautiful inside and out and the location was perfect (for visiting a Kenyon student) - on a lovely, quiet block with very nice neighbors. But aside from that, Jim was the best host ever. His attention to detail (flashlights next to the beds) and his hospitality made it feel like we were staying in a B&B without the breakfast. Jim even left flowers and a balloon for my daughter because I told him I was coming to celebrate her 18th birthday! Jim couldn't have been nicer and really made staying at his house an experience. I will stay here every time I come back to see my daughter and highly recommend the place for anyone looking to take a trip to Mt. Vernon."

The house is tucked onto a quiet, brick cobbled street a couple blocks from Mount Vernon center. We recommend the Ariel Foundation Park nearby for a beautiful nature stroll in an architectural gem.
Jim’s was the perfect home to rest in while visiting our daughter at a nearby college, and we look forward to returning!"

Not to sound cliche, however; If the walls of this house could talk…..I can only imagine the undertaking it was to renovate. Much of the old history was meticulously preserved in floors, windows, woodwork and the stairway banister is magical. I can just picture it at Christmas time all decked out. The newly added modern amenities were well thought out and stunning. The kitchen is extremely well stocked and even many extras are provided. Linens and towels were super comfy as well as the bedroom furnishings. I felt like I was in a dream. Wish I could have spent a little more time there to enjoy the home."

The home is a beautifully decorated, comfortable space. Several rooms that offer seating for small conversations or quiet time, but plenty of room for several adults to gather comfortably. The kitchen was well stocked with almost everything one might need to prepare foods. We cooked all of our meals there for the 3 night stay AND I baked a birthday cake and desserts for my family while there. The location was quiet, close to many restaurants and stores, the carport was great, and the home overall in excellent condition.
I will definitely use an Airbnb again for my traveling options, when returning to Mount Vernon, I will consider this home again if traveling with more than two adults and our two small pups! Thank you Owen for a great stay!"

The beds were so comfortable, and the shower was amazing! The upstairs has such high ceilings and the whole house has such beautiful natural lighting.

The carport worked out perfectly especially the first night as it was pouring rain when we arrived. We were very thankful we didn't have to unload our luggage in the rain.

The house itself is beautifully updated and feels extremely home-y without making guests feel like they're encroaching on someone's actual space, which can sometimes be a fine line to balance! We were particularly wowed by the bathroom, with its wildly tall ceilings and enormous tub. We also loved the outdoor seating off of the kitchen, where we split our gifted Prosecco and enjoyed some perfectly temperate June evenings during our stay."

Vernon--right across the street from a great coffee shop and independent bookstore, near restaurants, and over a wonderful art gallery (owned and operated by the hosts). Evidence of their artistic sensibility is everywhere in the apartment and all of the tasteful touches made our stay delightful. Also? Vicki left so many lovely treats for us--wine, cheese, bread, scones, and an actual basket of eggs (!), we felt spoiled and didn't even need to go to the grocery store. Thank you!"

Vernon’s small downtown. Other guests have mentioned the European feel of the apartment; to us, it was reminiscent of being in Old Quebec City. We very much enjoyed it.
Communications and check-in were a breeze, and Vicki’s directions and instructions were spot-on. The scones and other treats waiting for us in the bistro-style kitchen were welcoming, delicious and much appreciated.
Our only regret is that we didn’t have a chance to meet Vicki (we visited over Thanksgiving). Perhaps next time we will have that opportunity."

Stayed one night","The Galerie Suite is a perfect getaway in a great little town, Mt Vernon. Exceptionally clean, beautifully decorated, and truly a unique place to stay. Yummy treats left for us by the host in the refrigerator, too! It reminded me so much of my grandmother's building/home in New Jersey, which they occupied in the early 1900's... a skinny building with many floors and great antiques. The bed we slept in was very comfortable. The street is a little noisy, but the host had earplugs handy if necessary. We did not end up needing them - it's a city. We are accustomed to street noise. We were traveling on our bicycles on the OTET and the Galleria Suite is very close to the trail. Easy off, easy on! The patio is lovely and a perfect safe place for our bicycles. I highly recommend the Galerie Suite to all travelers, bicycles or not!"

As I sit to write this review, a statement from a local of Mt. Vernon is resounding in my thoughts “You couldn't have landed in a better place”. Hearing this from a community member, was affirming. Confirming what we felt the moment we arrived, in seeing the evident care that welcomed us, with an artistic twinkle throughout. The amenities offered added such a sweet spin to an already unique experience of this accommodating and comfortable arrangement. The family's Parisian style apartment was meticulously maintained to offer a travel friendly, clean, and downright charming stay.
We are grateful for having found such a place to stay and would be happy to come back and visit again!

Stayed a few nights","My wife & I traveled to Mt. Vernon, Ohio from Vermont to visit our youngest daughter at Kenyon College and attend two of her field hockey games. The Galerie Suite was a perfect fit for our two-night stay as it provided the extra living space you can't get from a hotel. We prepared home cooked meals in the quaint kitchen and ate them on the lovely private outdoor patio. Our daughter stayed with us for the two nights in the second bedroom - getting a break from the dorm room and cafeteria food. We also spent some quality time catching up while relaxing in the cozy living room. Vicki was an awesome host (as reflected by other testimonials)! You can't beat the personal touches she provided. Parking, location and walkability were added perks. We will be back!

It is so cozy, from the great mattress and soft sheets to the art on the walls, the area rugs, many lamps, eggs, bread, cheese, and wine, I could go on and on. Vickie met us when we arrived and gave us a tour. She is wonderful. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The location is within walking distance of quite a few restaurants, and the dog fountain is across the street. If you are on the fence about staying here, jump off and do it. You will love it."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay with Vicki. The apartment is above her art gallery, taking up the second and third floors. The second floor is a bedroom and bathroom. The third floor is a smaller bedroom, sitting area and fully functional kitchen. (Both bedrooms have double beds.) I appreciated the separation in space since I'm up earlier than the rest and could make coffee and read without waking everyone. The place is even more quaint than it looks in the pictures. It's really welcoming and lovely, and very well appointed. Vicki provided everything we could think to need- including scones and wine :) The private courtyard patio is another great space to sit and relax- very peaceful. The airbnb is on Main Street historic Mt. Vernon. So, there are lots of choices for food and shopping without having to drive. We stayed at Vicki's place for a couple of days for a wedding. My only regret is that we didn't have a full day to just stay there and relax!"

The value and price is unbeatable. They also provided small notes around the house regarding different things we needed to know about the house or appliances. They had a list of local restaurants and businesses for us to look at as well which was very helpful.
-The beds were very comfortable.
-Plenty of toiletries and small items were very handy. We didn't need any of them but if you forgot something they were very convenient.
-Many pillows and blankets if you need them.
-Lots of towels are a big plus!
-Kitchen was fantastic. We loved the provided treats (eggs, scones, bread) and enjoyed spending time in the kitchen.
-Mini TV worked well.
-WiFi worked with no issues.
-Thermostat was easily adjustable.
-Bathroom was nice. Shower looked great. We didn't use it but it looked very cool.

So well-appointed and thoughtfully planned, they have fresh treats and wine in the fridge awaiting you, brochures of the local area, and a kitchen and bathroom with everything you could ever imagine needing during your stay. The two bedrooms provide nice beds with lovely duvets covers that are very comfy. The location is perfect for easy walking to restaurants, coffee shops and galleries and only a 10-minute drive down Gambier Rd. to get to Kenyon College, if that's your aim. (The only downside is the somewhat loud traffic noise of pickup trucks at night and early morning, but they even provide ear plugs next to each bed for this.) There's also a little furnished patio if the weather allows for outdoor sitting. The hosts are great communicators providing clear directions, and they're also wonderful artists, inviting you to visit their beautiful gallery next story while you're staying there. Our very strong recommendation!"

This Airbnb is creatively designed, appealing to the eye and makes great use of all available spaces. The Gallery Suite is comfortable and functional and beautifully done. Vicki was readily available and no issues with the key pad entry. Thank you Vicki, for making it possible for me to check in earlier. That made the day flow perfectly. The only thing I would inform others of is that most of the businesses /restaurants are not open Sunday. The pub just up the street was open but a long wait for a table. I didn't realize I would need a reservation. But that does not take away from the time well spent in the apartment. Vicki is a generous host who had supplied the fridge with a bottle of wine, cheese, eggs, some incredible scones and a loaf of bread. I appreciated that greatly and would be happy to return another time."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at the Galerie Suite in downtown Mount Vernon, OH was really wonderful and we happily recommend staying here. Vicki provided a number of thoughtful touches to make us comfortable such as a bottle of wine, delicious mini scones, sour dough bread, cheese, and fresh eggs. The beds were very comfortable and we all slept well.
The apartment's location is especially wonderful for exploring the shops and restaurants downtown Mount Vernon. We especially recommend trying out th Alcove, Stein Brewing, the North Main Cafe, and the Happy Bean coffee shop (right across the street). We stayed over a weekend, so we were in close walking distance to the farmers market in the square on Saturday morning. Our two year old son was thrilled to be so close to the dog fountain across the street and we made many, many visits to see it.
Vicki did a wonderful job communicating with us and answered our questions quickly.
We will definitely be staying with Vicki again on our next visit to Mount Vernon."

Vernon within walking distance to coffee, food, drinks and anything else you could need. Vicki was a wonderful host, great at communicating for check-in and any questions we had during our stay. The apt has everything you could need, and was a great home for us during our week long stay. We will definitely return on our next trip to Mt. Vernon!"

Stayed a few nights","Vicki was very easy to communicate with, as well as a very thoughtful host. My friend and I met up for a weekend in Mount Vernon, and this place was the perfect size for us 2. The Airbnb is located downtown with close access to several restaurants, breweries, and cute, family run shops. There a several parks within biking/walking distance, with access to a great bike trail close by. There's even a bike rental place right around the corner. My only advice to people coming in from out of town to stay here is to look ahead at restaurant/shop hours. Many are closed on Sundays so if there is a specific place you would like to see try to plan around that :) A great place to visit for a quiet, relaxing weekend."

Stayed with kids","We loved staying here. It was perfect for our family of four. Lots of thoughtful touches in the kitchen, an electric kettle, lots of tea, a Keurig, fridge stocked with some snacks and fresh eggs from a local farm. Everything was very comfortable and pleasant. I would absolutely stay here again. Two things to keep in mind: one, there are a lot of stairs, just in case that's an issue for you (not for us -- I thought that was a benefit, separating our level from where our kids slept! wahoo!) and two, the path to the bathroom is through one of the bedrooms, so that would have been frustrating I think if we were two separate families, but for us it wasn't a problem. I loved the loads of clean towels. This place was very clean and the beds were comfortable, which I cannot say about all airbnbs. Vicki was very attentive to detail. Also, very close to lots of cute things in Mount Vernon. Wonderful!"

There was construction, but it didn’t bother us much. I think the only thing we would like to see is the beds changed. Although adorable, they are a bit creaky. If you’re a light sleeper, this might be disruptive to your sleep.
Otherwise, Vicki was extremely accommodating!"

Easy to get to Kenyon College. Vicki is an artist and when you are in this apartment you feel transported. All of the right touches to not only make you forget you are in Ohio but to transport you to that little French apartment you may have dreamed of. We have stayed here twice! This place is perfectly clean. The beds are very comfortable. My wife uses a noisemaker (ocean waves) to to sleep and this helps drown out street noise from downtown if you are a light sleeper. I didn't need anything. Thank you Vicki. We have already booked at least twice more over the next several months.

Stayed a few nights","Vicki and Robert's airbnb provided a get-away experience that made us feel like we were in a different state and on a mini-vacation. I was attracted to the style and small town charm while booking. We were welcomed with goodies in the fridge (those scones and fresh bread were very memorable!) as well as a clean place to stay. The host clearly communicated and resolved any issues that arose. The small city had a few exciting places to explore including a farmer's market and bbq food truck/brewery combo. I didn't fully understand the suite part of the listing where one bedroom wouldn't have a door nor did I understand the apartment would have a small opening to the back desk of the gallery during the day without a way to lock the apartment space. Other than wishing I would have read that somewhere, everything else met and somewhat exceeded expectations."

Stayed one night","This space was everything we could’ve asked for and more. My boyfriend and I took a trip to Mt. Vernon for a family wedding, and after seeing the air BnB we didn’t want to leave lol. Vicki was extremely prompt and helpful with the questions we had prior to arriving, letting us check in early, and check out when was most convenient for us the next day. She even asked our wine preference, being sure to stock the fridge with wine and plenty of food for us (which came in handy for breakfast the next morning lol). The space she has created for her guests are sure to leave you with a beautiful memory and a great time in this quaint little town. The space is just above a trendy little gallery, and in the center of the town. She provided an extremely modern large back patio leading up to the house. The house is absolutely beautiful, and vintage, with elements from the Victorian era, added with the modern updates, this place is everything one could ask for and more during a trip to this beautifully historic town. Thank you again Vicki for making our weekend trip one we won’t soon forget."

It's a luxurious place to rest, enjoy the beautiful artwork and decor, the delicious snacks, and so much more. When I was in college, I took a tour of the place and always dreamt of staying there. I finally got to and it did not disappoint! Every little detail made it special and made us feel like 5 star guests. The Parisian style makes you feel like you're in Europe! It does not have a TV because is more of a place to go to get away from the craziness and relax-- read a book and drink a glass of wine. We definitely recommend and hope we can come back someday!"

The gallery downstairs is lovely and filled with interesting art made by Vicki, her husband and her four talented grown children. Then, upstairs, the apartment is a work of art too! It's decorated beautifully and very comfortably! Lots of interesting little touches - loved the lace curtain in the bathroom and the curtain in the kitchen, as well as the cute eclectic furnishings. (Really I'd love for Vicki to come and decorate my house!) And, to top it all off, Vicki left us homemade bread & muffins, butter, jam, and fresh eggs. So we were able to make ourselves a delicious breakfast in the morning!
Beds were comfy and there was plenty of light for reading in bed. Vicki really thought of everything!"

The impeccable bedding, towels, furniture etc are all very elegant and beautiful as well as comfortable. I arrived to lovely flowers in vases, beautiful lamps lit and wine and cheese and bread. So fantastic. Vicki was very communicative and felt like a friend even though we didn't get a chance to meet. I highly recommend their place, perfect romantic getaway if you do such things ;)"

Fresh flowers everywhere. Lovely wine, cheese and bread were left for us to enjoy. I can't begin to say enough how wonderful this place is! I am a professional photographer of women and I will most certainly be back to use it for a backdrop for some of my photographs.

This is a really cool space, classy and quirky at the same time with a cute kitchen upstairs and a great granite shower in the bathroom. We had everything we needed and more.
The only thing is that if you need dark, dark in order to sleep well you might want to bring a sleeping mask, because being in town (on a relatively quiet street) enough light comes in through the pretty stained glass windows that it seems like almost dawn even in the middle of the night.
This would be a great deal for two couples traveling together."

LuAnn offered a secure location to store my eBike and trailer overnight that was out of the elements just in case of rain which was greatly appreciated.

We'll absolutely be looking to LuAnn's spacious and very comfortable space when we next come back. An early-spring blast of cold weather kept us from appreciating the screened in space, but we'll look forward to that when we return. Great attention to details that many other hosts miss: cream for coffee in the fridge, an assortment of snacks and drinks, motion-sensor lights in spaces to help guide our way. Very highly recommend, and this is a great value."

Pros: extremely comfortable and clean, nice little touches such as smart TV’s, snacks, drinks and milk in the refrigerator that you are welcome to enjoy, body wash and shampoo ready for you in the bathroom and much more.
Cons: Honestly there really isn’t a negative but if I just had to say something it would be that you can hear the owners walking upstairs pretty good during the course of your stay. Nothing terrible.
Just a fantastic time with great hosts, you’ll love it there."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely, clean place with a comfortable bed and linens, great outdoor spaces, and THREE TVs. However, we were not expecting it to be in the basement. (We knew that many homes in this hilly area have ground level walk-in entrances, and this is what we expected.) We had traveled from Florida, stopped for 5 nights to visit family and then headed to Wis. for several months. Because of this we had a lot of foodstuffs and medication that required freezing and refrigerating. But the ""refrigerator"" turned out to be only a mini-fridge. Todd was quick to help carry our large, heavy cooler down the stairs and offered to freeze whatever we needed. (Thanks again!) Another disadvantage of basement living is that guests have no control over the room temperature, other than closing the vents, which helped a little. If you don't mind stairs (watch your head!), a small mini-fridge and limited kitchen area, and like it cool, then this is a great place for you. It was nicely furnished and stocked with snacks, drinks, bathroom items, etc. and Toby and LuAnn are very accommodating."

Oh and the bed? Sleeps just as good as our own if not better! So comfortable!!!! We slept very good! They practically have everything we use and need at home. I did not have to use nothing of mine. I usually bring our fire sticks/extra entertainment for our kiddos to Airbnb’s because a lot of places may not have a smart tv etc.. no need to bring your own entertainment she got it!

We also stopped at Fiesta Mexicana nearby and had yummy Tex-Mex (I’ve lived in Texas 14 years so I know my Tex-Mex).

Group trip","Unfortunately, the place reeked of Trash the first day we were there. It was abundantly clear that the trash can (though empty upon arrival) had rotting garbage sitting in it long before it was removed. It smelled
Like rotten chicken. The twin bed was super
Wobbly and one of us ended up having to
Sleep on the couch due to safety concern.
Sam was responsive but not action was taken to remediate the smell. We had to open all the windows and Lysol spray everywhere to make it tolerable. A partial refund should have been given for the inconvenience for the smell or someone should’ve been sent to do something about it.
Ping pong table was broken and uneven upon arrival.
Outside of the smell, bed, and ping pong situation, it was a great cabin. 2/5."

We know the listing does state that it’s well water, and could have a taste… but this went far beyond that. It was a very bad, very strong smell.
We didn’t want to shower or brush our teeth/wash our faces with this water due to how bad it smelled. It was really bad, and was throughout the house but definitely stronger when the water ran."

It's both modern and cozy and exactly want you want for a cabin gathering. The beds were awesome and the kitchen was equipped with most everything you'd need. Sam was very proactive and sent clear instructions for both entry and departure. I would recommend staying here 10/10!"

The first floor is spacious yet cozy. The rooms are good sized and the bathroom is big.
Actually wish we spent more time at the property.
It was a lovely summer evening, so my friend and I took advantage of the porch swing and stayed on it until after dark. The crickets were chirping and made for a peaceful evening.
Overall a quiet place.
We had gravel race in Homer, so this was a convenient location for the night before.
Host sent instructions a few days before and was responsive when I had questions.
Thank you for the late check out so that we could freshen up before the drive home.

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Barb's place for several days while delivering my daughter to Kenyon for her first year of college. I can't say enough about what a gracious, warm, helpful, accommodating, helpful, and communicative host Barb is! When we drove up on the windy back roads I thought we were in the middle of nowhere and hopelessly far away from everything, but it's really just a few minutes drive to Kenyon College and/or Mount Vernon and it's so nice to come back to this beautiful, quiet, and peaceful respite at the end of a busy day. (That said, I would try to arrive during daylight hours on your first visit!) My daughter and I loved the apartment, which was spotless and very well equipped. The couch is very comfortable, the TV and WiFi work well, and the apartment is spacious for two people. I enjoyed hiking at nearby Brown Family Environmental Center and sitting out front to read and watch the sun go down. I look forward to exploring the area more on my next visit. I liked it so much that I immediately wanted to book it for Family Weekend in October, but was too late. Highly recommend. I will be back to Barb's airbnb!"

The drive from CMH to Gambier at night (alone!) was pretty daunting but Barbara told me to call her if I needed to. She went on to say that, ""Sometimes hearing a friendly voice on the other line can calm your fears."" She knew exactly what I was feeling and was a very thoughtful gesture to extend to me.
She and Bill made my stay in Gambier wonderful. I got to see some snow fall, a rare sight in Southern California. I loved their place - very spacious and welcoming. We will definitely be back in May. Thank you, Bill and Barbara, for a wonderful stay in the countryside.

I visited the property with my daughter and we had plenty of space. There is also a porch/deck in the back. The area is very quiet, (and dark at nighttime!), 2-3 miles from Gambier-Kenyon College, going on a few back roads. I think its an especially great property for a couple or family who want to have some meals at home because it is spacious and because of the full kitchen, and good for anyone visiting Kenyon, as I was. Barbara was highly responsive and is obviously interested in having her guests have a good experience. The place was immaculate and I would definitely stay there again."

They were thoughtful enough to put out extra blankets for us! Though we didn't have a chance to relax on the back porch, the view is beautiful. Barbara and Bill could not be kinder folks and we can't wait to return! I highly recommend a stay at this - No Ordinary Manor!"

Stayed over a week","Lovely, quiet place surrounded by the beauty of the rural Ohio countryside. Just minutes from Kenyon College and MVNU. About an hour from Easton in the Columbus area. Wonderful getaway from the stress of city life! Barb is a gracious and attentive host!!"

Antonia helped in referring us to the best places to visit and cost if there was any. A great place to visit and relax. Thank you Antonia."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for two nights while moving our son home from Kenyon College. Home was very clean and beautifully decorated. Furniture was not to our preferred comfort level, couch sits extremely low to the floor with little head rest and bed seemed a little small for a couple to sleep comfortably. We would consider staying again when the house is finished being remodeled completely as we would need more space because family usually tags along when we visit. The host was VERY responsive & home is in a GREAT neighborhood as we have stayed at several Air B&Bs in the area! Thank You again!"

Group trip","We got to be the first guests at Scott and Stacey's. Their place is gorgeous, plenty of space and we especially enjoyed the patio with the gas fire pit and surround sound music. Hosts were incredibly responsive and did all they could to ensure we had a good stay. All great place, whether you are golfing at Chapel Hill or other fun Mt.Vernon activities."
