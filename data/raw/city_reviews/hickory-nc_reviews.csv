Stayed with a pet","Nathan and Ali were great hosts for our visit to Hickory. It was a rainy weekend, but the home was lovely and spacious. Unfortunately, a few days before our visit, a tree had fallen on the back yard fence. Nathan let me know and was able to makeshift a repair before our visit. It was greatly appreciated, as we thoroughly enjoyed the back yard. We would definitely visit again."

Stayed with a pet",We stayed for a week in the Hickory area with our two toddlers to visit the area and visit family. This home was such a pleasure to stay at. The most efficent Airbnb home I have ever been too. They took great attention to detail by labeling things to remove any guess work on where to find things. We were very impressed with the organization and cleanliness of the home. Nathan and Ali were very responsive and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. This is an older home but updated in all the right areas which gives such a charming character to the home with nice decorative touches. The outdoor entertaining area with firepit was awesome! The fenced back yard and the pull out trundle bed made this a great place if you have little ones. This place if full of all the essentials and even extra things to make the stay very comfortable. This home is Airbnb done right. We would highly recommend staying here and will do so again in the future. Thank you Nathan and Ali!

Stayed a few nights","Great little house! Nice responsive hosts!Clean,cabinets full of all the essentials, traveled with family of 4 plenty of room so everyone had their own space and able to do laundry at home while on vacation. The back deck and backyard was awesome with fire pit for the evening fires wish we were there longer for more relaxing evening. It is on college campus basically but was not a problem at all fairly quiet even with baseball games across the street! Would definitely book again!!!"

Group trip","Nathan and Ali put so much thought into this home from the amenities and decor, to the details in each room. They gave us such a warm welcome and it was so heartwarming to see the personal touches that were added. Even though we didn’t bring our dog, everything you need for yours is there in case you forget! The back deck is great for warm nights and sunny days. The house is also conveniently located within walking distance to LR and a quick 3 minute drive to grocery stores and restaurants! Nathan and Ali are great hosts. Can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed about a week","Lovely home with a full kitchen and laundry space that worked out very well for my stay as I was traveling across the country. The hosts put a lot of thought in trying to make sure that the space is comfortable and also included items like some K cups and water bottles and snacks. I would only recommend this for one person as it is small and there isn’t a lot of storage space but it was perfect for my needs. Bring drinking water with you and be prepared for road noise during the day, but overall, this was a very comfortable space, and I’m grateful to have gotten to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute little house. I felt right at home. The hosts had nice little touches that made it feel like home. There was access to a huge front porch that was perfect for sitting and just relaxing. The location was in older neighborhood of beautiful homes. Supermarkets, shopping and dining were all easily accessible by car within anywhere from a 10 minute drive or further. There were other tenants in the home but they were very quiet.
I would definitely stay here again."

We had some issues getting inside but it was quickly resolved and everything else was perfect. Everything was clean and organized and cute. Our only complaints were that there was no closet, and I thought the description said fully stocked kitchen but there was only salt and pepper and a minimal amount of other dishes. But overall we loved this place, it was nearly perfect for our quick stay!"

They were kind and courteous, responsive and thoughtful. The instructions were spot on! Although I didn’t get to spend much time there, I think it was the best nights sleep I’ve had in a long time after travelling the last week - the place was clean and comfortable and I wish I could have spent longer. Next time I’m in Hickory for work or pleasure, I’ll definitely be checking to see if the place is free."

The only issue was that I’m 6’1 and had to crouch somewhat in the shower because the shower head was a little low. Tall people beware but everything else was perfect for us! We would still stay here again if we come back to Hickory! Great communication with hosts and they gave us lots of recommendations for the area.

The hosts truly thought of every detail. we loved the motion lights at night for when you get up not knowing the place and your surroundings. The small snacks, the little labels on the lights so you know what its for, the greeting...no detail spared. Oh, and the bed was probably the best I've stayed in. Well done and thank you, top notch!"

Stayed one night","We were SO impressed with our stay at this house. You can tell that the owners really put a lot of thought into the overall experience for guests. From the moment you book with them, the owners were quick to communicate and make themselves available. They ensured that instructions and directions were clear throughout the stay, even going above and beyond to provide instructional cards and labels throughout the house to help you know how to use things best. Check-in and check-out were super easy and we were amazed at the personalization that they provided…I won’t spill all the secrets that they have up their sleeve, but they really provide all they can to make sure you have a great stay. The house was stocked with everything you could want and more in the kitchen, bathroom, and even living spaces. We enjoyed a quiet night on the back porch and loved reading in the quaint reading nook too. Overall we are so grateful for all of the effort the owners out in to help make our stay great!"

Stayed a few nights","Carlos was great at communicating with me prior to my arrival. When I landed in Charlotte, the airline had lost my luggage. I messaged Carlos asking if the Airbnb had any necessities that I could possibly use before spending a lot of money at Target. He told me what he had at the Airbnb for me to use and also allowed me to use the washer and dryer for my few clothes to wear. I was forever grateful and felt so well taken care of! God is good and God made sure I came here to be taken care of.
Thank you again! 🙏"

Stayed a few nights","Cute little place. The bed was very comfortable. It felt like a foam mattress. It was squishy but still had some firmness. Very happy with that. One minor issue was that we could not find any silverware. Not a big deal and we didn't ask if it was stored somewhere we couldn't find, but you may need to know that. The value is great. Much nicer than a hotel room. The back porch and fire pit area are a nice amenity as well. Highly recommend staying here."

The kitchen is spotless with useful appliances (I enjoyed the toaster). Loved the bathroom with a barnyard door, nice touch. Also enjoyed the rainwater shower head.
What's incredible is that while it's a small space, they've been able to make it feel larger. That could be thanks to the design of the home and also the very comfortable king bed.
This is a small touch but I enjoyed the complimentary Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus.
I'd be back in a heartbeat."

Stayed one night","Let me recommend setting aside some time to enjoy the thought put into Chasity and Gene's guest suite.
Get some carry out and dine in their dining area and take in the painstaking curation of their decorations. Spend the evening relaxing in their living room before bed.
We checked in late and realize we cheated ourselves by using the place as a crash pad. Take the time to enjoy the fun this home provides you.
The beds were more comfortable than hotel beds we normally get, my daughter enjoyed the decor upstairs as well.
Mr. Gene informed us of the history of the Hickory neighborhood you'll be staying in and introduced us to their big, shy, friendly dog who needed a late night walk after we arrived.
The quarters are separate and the hosts are available if needed, but are ready to provide all the privacy you wish.
We were visiting a friend in Statesville. Stay with Gene and Chasity if you're anywhere close to Hickory. You'll get much more than a bed and bath."

Stayed a few nights","This was our second stay at Vintage Vibes and it did not disappoint. We were very happy the first time around and were just as happy this time. The location is central to town which makes it easy to get around. The rooms themselves are upstairs, behind the coolest door, and very private. Be sure to check out the bathroom wallpaper. It's a hoot!
Cleanliness and comfort are the name of the game here. I never worry about yucks from neglect or other guests. Chasity and Gene work really hard to maintain a high level of service for their guests and it shows.
They are open, friendly, accepting, and communicative. They do have a dog, but we never saw or heard it (very sad :( ...maybe next time). We did hear some low noise once in a while, but that is par for the course when staying in someone's home. The shared space downstairs is very cool vintage. The art is my favorite part.
Pick Vintage Vibes!! You won't be disappointed."

The decor in the actual bnb rooms, INCREDIBLE!
The beds are so super comfy!!
The thoughts and details they provide with the amenities are simply mind-blowing.
The crystals and geodes out on the patio loved them!!
The location is close to anything and everything!!

They are located in a very nice residential area close to downtown Hickory, which you need to visit. The bed was really comfortable, as was my stay. You have the upstairs with two separate bedrooms, one has the TV. Gene recommended a good restaurant in DT Hickory called the Old Hickory Station, which has a restaurant and connecting store to shop for craft beer, wines, deserts, and awesome macaroons. etc....."

Stayed a few nights","I chose to stay at Gene & Chasity's based on the convenience of the location in relation to a wedding I was attending in downtown Hickory. After looking through the listing pictures and reading all the excellent reviews, it was an easy choice. Considering that the wedding I was attending had been postponed 3 times due to covid, therefore my reservation dates kept changing, I can attest to the wonderful communication and willingness to help provided by the host. Upon my arrival, I knew immediately that I had struck Airbnb gold. The pictures do not give justice to this groovy, cozy apartment and their warm and inviting home. I cannot stress enough how CLEAN everything is. However, this is not a sterile, boring, run of the mill hotel suite, this is a delightful, private apartment in a lovely (& safe) neighborhood, that feels like home. All of the little things you forgot (or didn't even know you needed!) are provided in the space; their attention to the tiniest of details is exceptional. You can also set the temperature to your own desire (air & heat). Water is hot and plentiful (heads up- it is a smallish stand-up shower, but not a problem for me). With a comfortable bed (I chose the king) and the quiet location, you will sleep like a baby here. For dog lovers- Valentina is the sweetest girl, but if (for some strange reason that I can't understand), you're not an animal person, you'll never know she's there. Smoker's & vapor's- there is a nice patio table/ chairs in the inviting yard where you won't feel like an outcast getting your fix. Families with kids- child friendly. Everyone else- all are warmly welcomed here. Book this one with confidence...."

Stayed with kids","You ABSOLUTELY CANNOT GO WRONG!!! Gene nd Chasity have created a unique, comfortable, and clean environment. They are extremely responsive to inquiries and show real concern for their guest's comfort. We had absolutely no issues whatsoever. The neighborhood is very unique and centrally located. It's great for taking a walk or playing at the nearby park.
There are only a couple things you need to be aware of (not negatives, just awareness) Since the space is a former attice, it has slanted ceilings. So, if you are tall, you will need to bend your head a bit in the hall to avoid hitting the ceiling. The other concern is that shower stall is on the narrow side for a big guy. The hubby is 6'4 and 270, so he was a bit squished.
Again, you won't go wrong renting from Gene and Chasity. It really does hit all the boxes on the comfort, cleanliness, and relaxation scale. We plan to stay with them the next time we are in Hickory if it works out."

Also, for us traveling during the ongoing covid crisis, we felt that everything was completely safe and clean, and I felt like there was less risk or exposure potential here than in a hotel. I would highly recommend a stay here and will look to come back again if the opportunity arises!"

Stayed one night",We had a comfortable 1-night stay at Cathy's while starting to get to know the Hickory area. Great location in a peaceful neighborhood very close to downtown and the Viewmont area. Loved the historic character of the house and appreciated being able to check in early. Slept well and had a great shower - it was exactly what we needed!

The room was large and there was a second space with the other amenities. The bathroom was spotless and the towels were plush. Everything was very quiet and private, and the home is in a well-kept established neighborhood. Cathy communicated well and was a very kind and charming host. I highly recommend staying here."

In fact, I've already booked three additional stays through the end of 2024."

The cottage is very centrally located and a great home base if you need to be in the Hickory area. And it doesn’t hurt that you have a full-on view of the town’s most beautiful cathedral—Corinth Church.
Everything was very clean and tidy, and we especially appreciated it being dog-friendly. The area is very walkable for those bringing fur babies.
The only feedback I would share is that some of the linens and the mattress could use updating for comfort and freshness. Nate’s place is a great value and I’d recommend staying there!"

This is an old house with few updates. In order to use the clothes dryer, I had to spend time cleaning around the dryer vent area and inside door. Obvious ant issues in kitchen as there was pesticide products under the sink and dead ants on windowsill. Driveway was a challenge to back into or turn around and on a pretty busy road. House needs updating to control dampness and make doors function better. No backyard space. Requests for checking out from host were written on boards in the house that had so many comments from prior guests that they were easily overlooked. Email instructions and directions were good."

Stayed one night",213 House was perfect for our overnight in Hickory. The place was easy to find and set back off the road. Driveway parking felt safe and we enjoyed a nice cocktail on the front porch. Inside was spotless with plenty of homey touches. And the mattress in the master was super comfy!

Stayed a few nights","This place was a great size, cozy but not cramped. So many little touches throughout the place made us feel as if we were at home. Extra things always seemed to be where we needed them like kitchen items, creamer for the coffee, blankets on the couch and much more. The views of the old stone church from the house were amazing. We appreciated the helpful labels for the light switches. We loved reading the messages on the “chalkboards! Nate’s response to messages was awesome. The neighbors were quiet. Everything was enjoyable! Be aware there is some street noise and the curtains were too thin with no blinds in the master bedroom. We definitely would stay at Nate’s place again!"

Stayed a few nights","Your first impression will be that it is small, but in a very beautiful location. Four can sleep there, as long as two don't mind sharing a queen bed. Everything is very clean and comfortable. Plenty of kitchen ware and appliances in good condition and a small kitchen table seats four.
The cottage sits back from a very busy street that is difficult to get across or turn in front of on-coming traffic. At night it is not easy to see the entry and other drivers are not patient. I would suggest that some kind of reflectors are installed at the entrance to the driveway to help locate it. There is a telephone pole right beside the driveway on which a couple of small reflectors could be nailed.
Do not miss the park about a mile away if you have time. It is one of my favorite places and some years ago, I used to run down there and it is great, especially if you like to run hills.
The hosts, Nate and Erin, are great and I will stay again, if I can."

When you dont want to be in a hotel and dont require upscale but want neat, clean, comfortable surroundings, this is the place to stay in Hickory. Plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby and close to shopping too. Will definitely return when back in Hickory! Nate and Erin were always gracious and available if you need them."

They thought of everything :) Church in the front was breathtaking! It made me feel like I was in a Christmas movie. There is lots of restaurants near by and even a Publix!!! Big deal since I’m from Florida lol The host are super nice!!!

The location (right near Hickory downtown and Lenoir-Rhyne University) ideal for my work travel back-and-forth during the week. Many nearby restaurants and supermarkets (try the Lowe's market which has a nice open bar area to sip wine or vanity of beers including local ones). Susanne is very responsive and accommodating.

No clutter! The neighborhood looked a little aged but this place was so crispy & new. The neighbors were nice. The garage was an added bonus. The ac works amazing and the washer and dryer were new and spotless. The kitchen was tastefully done. Suzanne was also very nice.
It was overall a great stay & will stay again for sure. I always have to give a couple “ critiques” when I stay somewhere.

My 2 things that I could see being an issue for certain people…
1) the beds are really low (I was ok with it and liked it but may be hard for someone older or with mobility problems.
2) the mattress covers were very noisy."

The property is hands down a great and beautiful property place to relax for a family get away! The pictures does this property no justice! It is way more beautiful l, spacious and relaxing then anticipated! It’s what I call breathtaking! My home away from home!
Definitely will be the first place my family and I will look up to stay when we come back into town again!
Thank you so much “Donna”; for everything and the personal touches as a host! This was everything and more of what was expected! Thanks again!!!

Home is close enough to the downtown area that trips to local restaurants, grocery stores, etc were a breeze…yet, secluded enough on a wooded lot to make you feel as if you were the only ones in town. The kitchen is perfect for feeding/entertaining larger families and we loved the larger tables offering plenty of seating together. Beautiful bathroom/shower on main level was definitely a huge hit…everyone commented on how amazing it was!! Would definitely stay here again and would recommend this home to others traveling to Lake Hickory."

The location is perfect - located on a beautiful, quiet cove of Lake Hickory on a wooded lot but it is only 10 mins or less to everything in Hickory. It has absolutely everything you could need. The downstairs area feels like a whole different house and would be a great area for older kids to hangout in the evenings. The host is very nice and responds immediately to questions or concerns.

Stayed one night","Stayed here in the middle of a 20+ hour road trip down from Connecticut visiting family for the holidays and it was the PERFECT place to stay—we were actually disappointed we weren’t able to stay longer. Travis was probably the kindest host we have had here on airbnb, as well! Made sure we had everything we needed 24 hours in advance and even made sure to have the room heated beforehand (we got in a bit late—8pm—and it was so nice to walk into that.) Coming in so late with rain, I was also a bit concerned that it would be difficult to find the guest house but it was just as described and we found it easily! Had everything one would need for the night and we were overall very happy with our stay—cheaper, prettier, AND more spacious than a hotel. Would definitely stay again, given the opportunity!"

Only one thing to be aware of: this has nothing to do with the stay itself, but it's good to be aware of just for planning. The building is down a long hill, so that might be problematic if someone has ambulatory difficulties. We do not, so it was no problem at all. It was wonderful and I would stay again."

It is exactly how Travis describes, small and very clean. There is a curtain you can pull out for the bathroom area if needed. The walk to the backyard where the room is can be a little tricky - believe him when he tells you to use a flashlight! Travis was super responsive the whole time and even gave some recommendations for local restaurants. The room was very clean and I felt safe the whole time we were there. All of the locals were super friendly as well. We will definitely be booking here again if we come back to the area anytime soon. Thank you Travis and family for the great place to stay!"

Stayed with a pet",Very private and quiet. It is true that it is a fairly steep hill to get up and down to the cottage. The pathway is uneven so be careful. The porch needs a little love. It was sturdy but I was unsure at first. The only true issue is the shower has very little water pressure which makes it difficult. The hosts were very friendly and the cottage is cute and it is a short drive to anything a person could need. I would recommend it for one person or a couple.

I did walk in the neighborhood to see the sunrise and views of the river. Some parts are on an incline, which is why I didn’t describe as walkable, as it might not be for everyone. Travis accurately described the path to the location as needing care and ability to navigate a walking path with a bit of downward grade. I appreciate that he verified that was ok with me, and there was opportunity for me to check in early."

My partner and I don't need much when we travel and often find ourselves paying for way more than we need because it's all that's available, we are grateful to have found a practical and more private alternative to hotels. 10/10"

The room is small but totally doable. The bed isn’t the best and there is plastic on it so it gets hot quick but I was able to sleep a decent amount.
I was there in December and it did get really cold but they do provide a heater and as long as that’s going it was warm enough.
There is the essentials there and a coffee pot with ground coffee available which was nice.

The only thing I would say to be aware of is some loud road noise occasionally. It sounded like maybe some local kids used a nearby road for street racing. It wasn't in the neighborhood, but you could hear it in the distance a few times. Otherwise, it was a great stay!! Would definitely stay again."

Travis was an excellent host and even before we confirmed booking he was letting us know about the path down to it to make sure it was okay for us. He was the perfect amount of attentive.
The space is very neat and clean, WI-FI worked great for us.
Only thing to note is that if you’re traveling with someone I hope you’re close to them because the toilet only has a curtain separating it from the rest of the space.
For the price it’s hard to beat."

We would have appreciated a couple of bowls and a comfortable chair, but that's really it. My chief concern was that the cabin was located a good distance from where we parked our car and the path between them was steep and some of the pavers were a little far apart making it a little weird to traverse. I don't remember the listing explaining the walk, which could be problematic for some people."

I will say that if you are traveling with another person be sure you are super comfortable with them because the bathroom is closed off with a (very nice) curtain arrangement.

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely love Little Blue and this was the second time we have stayed here. The house is in a great location. All of the furnishings are high-end, with nice Ikea flatware and dishes in the kitchen, awesome fluffy towels in the bathroom, and a comfortable bed with nice linens. We came over for the Prohibition Hot Rod & Moonshine Festival to see Them Dirty Roses. We spent the next day with a nice mountain drive and hit up a few breweries in the area. Hickory is a nice area and we have thoroughly enjoyed both of our visits. One of the things I love the most about this place is that it is pet-friendly and June really means that! There are no breed restrictions or weight limits (our poor fat girl is often disqualified at some other AirBnBs) and there are no rules about pets staying off the furniture. Pet blankets are even provided. It eases my mind to know that we have a go-to spot in Hickory where Sophie is welcome! We highly recommend this place!"

Stayed with a pet","Little Blue was a beautiful home with everything we would need and more! Besides the clean and well appointed home, the beds were super comfortable, the towels and linens were buttery-soft, and the included coffee was well received! We had our two dogs with us and June even had dog blankets and little toys for them! My 1.5 year old pup loved carrying the toys around and I think it made him feel at home. June was very responsive and very friendly. The house was perfect for our stay and it's convenient to everything in Hickory. I recommend Little Blue to everyone!"

Home is more then perfect, great space for small family or pet family. Any and all questions were answered almost immediately not that we had many, June really thought of everything. Wish I could say more about neighborhood but unfortunately we went out of the area every day. Loved that we could cook a meal for family while staying, everything you need is there. You can tell June & Bill (Love) what they do and (Love) this home. Little Blue may be little but they really thought of every detail to make it feel like a mansion. Can’t thank them enough for our peaceful, relaxing stay in Hickory. Thank you thank you thank you 🙏🏻"

She clearly put a lot of thought into an attractive decor that gave warmth to the place but did not clutter up needed surfaces. Her instructions were very clear and the location had a great balance of being in a quiet neighborhood and yet just within a few minutes drive to downtown which had lots of dining and shopping options.
Lots of great amenities. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. The towels were nice and thick.
And the laundry room was an especially nice feature that you often don’t see. Even a couple of umbrellas hanging by the door in case you didn’t pack one.
We had a great stay and would definitely recommend this unit to others."

Stayed with a pet","The owners of Little Blue really thought of everything you might need when setting up this house. The house feels uncluttered while at the same time being thoughtful. Umbrellas at the door, conveniently placed hooks, usb cords, tide pods for laundry etc.. The house is well maintained and very clean. The yard is very nice and worked well for our kids and pups. I would say the only negative was the cars speeding on the street, which the owner cannot help, and the neighbors dog (which they keep outside are certain times during the day). The owner looked to be in the process of installing a privacy fence which should take care of the neighbor dog issue. The location worked pretty well for us as well it was close enough to town for what we needed. Overall a pleasant stay in a nicely kept little house."

I can’t say enough about the pillows and beds-SO COMFY!! We would absolutely stay again and recommend to friends! As far as food goes: you have to try the local pizzeria Il Bambini! It was the best pizza we’ve ever had and it’s hidden in Hickory, NC! Breakfast at the Old Hickory Station is a must (I endorse the breakfast sandwich). Also there was an açaí bowl/smoothie shop that was delicious. Lots of parks to walk/hike and a quaint town square area. Overall, what a wonderful Airbnb in a precious town! 5/5 stars for June and Little Blue Hickory!"

June even provided us a sanitizing station to use during our stay. The location was 7 mins from a beautiful downtown area that we visited for breakfast and to walk our dog. Just the sweetest place to visit. I would love to come back for a longer stay. 😃"

Stayed a few nights","Super cute and clean place. We were amazed by the fireflies at dusk, had only seen them in storybooks and movies. Very homey feel and more than you could need, including a lot of kitchen utensils and appliances. Large capacity washer and dryer. Water pressure is a little low on the shower but not terrible by any means and plenty of hot water. Beautiful home, decorated perfectly. Because of the natural wood flooring (most of it), you can hear anytime anyone is up moving around. Neighbors had dogs that would bark when we were outside but only during the daytime and not every time. There's a camera on the porch, didn't look for or see any others. Air-conditioning worked well."

Stayed with kids",From the beginning the host provided pertinent information to make sure that our trip in would be efficient. On arrival there was an issue with the lock but the host had already taken measures to make sure we were able to get in to the residence without any issue. The residence was very clean on the inside but there was a used cigar on the porch and when we attempted to use the glasses in the cabinet they had to be rewashed because something sticky was inside. The only observation that I felt could be addressed was provided to the host without feedback. I will say that the place is definitely worth the money and was secluded enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of the world. the lack of ambient lighting was also a plus as the sky was able to look as it should without it. It is a rural location and if we are ever back in the area it will definitely be a place we would stay in again.

My partner and I stayed here during the holiday season as I was visiting family and upon arrival, this air bnb was the coziest it could be. They decorated the interior with cozy candles, everything smelled great, super clean, holiday decorations were set up. It was very cute. Growing up in hickory I was pleasantly surprised to see an air bnb as nice one this one. You’ll love your stay here, well worth it"

We only stayed 2 nights but was happy to find a science center 8 mins from the house for our 15 month old. We appreciated the binder full of information and especially emergency contact services. Our son is obsessed with Coco and they had Disney+ already set up! I was thankful how much they had to offer such as kids bowls, plates and a high chair! All these really set them apart from the rest. They really did think of anything you could need for your stay. Would recommend and would stay again to explore more of the lovely town of Hickory!"

The bathroom was not stocked with toilet paper ( I would not consider 1 and 1/3 rolls “stocked”) and the mattresses were described as “New Luxury Mattresses”. They may have been new, but one was way too firm.
Be sure to bring your own trash bags as only one is provide per trash can which are small and get filled up quickly.
There is also a lack of privacy and safety due to the main front living room window being covered in a sheer curtain. All other windows do have blinds.
Overall the stay was OK."

Stayed one night",Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. This was hands-down the best Airbnb experience and would highly recommend your location to anyone. From the coffee station to detailed labels made it feel like home. As a professional organizer you should feel proud of your hard work. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.
