Stayed a few nights","Wow! What a beautiful and peaceful place. From the time we arrived, we felt right at home. We were greeted with AMAZING chocolate chip cookies and muffins. The animals were so fun to watch and pet; I loved listening to the animals in the morning at feeding time. The cabin was spotless and the beds were so comfortable. There was plenty of space to park the two trucks and charge the boat. We will stay here again at the next fishing tournament. Thank you for sharing your little slice of heaven on Earth."

Stayed a few nights","We were there for two weeks and loved every minute. Very nice home to stay in. Had everything we needed. Great location, quiet, peaceful and a beautiful country farm setting. Jim and Carol are fantastic hosts. We had our 4 yr old grandson with us most of the time and what an awesome time he had. He loved riding around in one of the Gators helping feed the horses and goats. Carol brought some worms and fishing poles one morning and took us down to the pond and went fishing. Every cast we had a fish. Perfect for a 4 yr old. Carol even put the worm on the hook!! A wonderful experience for all. We have nothing but good things to say about our stay. Hope to come back again even if it is just to sit on the front porch and watch the goats, they are so entertaining. Thank you Jim and Carol you are so appreciated and you will forever be grandpa farmer Jim and grandma farmer Carol to our grandson Braden."

Stayed a few nights","Jim was a very kind and considerate host. He gave clear guidance on how to enjoy the farm and the MANY animals. The place is a lovely escape, super quiet and peaceful. The home felt like a true home and had everything we needed (except internet, but hey, it's good to go off the grid now and then!). We walked in to find chocolate chip cookies and muffins waiting for us, plus the all important coffee. The pictures on the listing are very accurate. I stayed there with a couple from Germany who were ready to stay for a month! The animals are an added bonus and we saved all our leftover veggies and fruits in a bag for the pigs. (Jim got our ice cream.) A super place--we had a huge thunderstorm our last night and we spent hours on the porch watching the show, it was amazing. All good, great stay, if you are in the area and want a quiet escape, go here!"

The host left us bottled water, chocolate chip cookies, muffins, and danish. That was a great extra touch, and fantastic for us to snack on. In the morning we took advantage of seeing all of the animals with our 1.5 year old son, and he had the time of his life! Such a sweet couple that hosts this place. I look forward to coming back."

Stayed a few nights","The perfect place for our mid-week mini vacation ""escape"" from city life. It is a peaceful setting, quiet dark sky nights, gorgeous sunrises and evening walks to view all the many miniature horses in their corrals. It was fun to talk to Jim and Carol as they fed all their precious animals. The house was cozy, artistically appointed and perfect for just chilling out, reading, doing some crafts, playing board games, preparing meals and sleeping on the comfortable bed. And, the ""Wecome"" baked treats were especially tasty."

They even left out some baked goods upon arriving which was a nice touch. I definitely reccomend Curly's ranch if you are in the area or simply looking for a cool place to stay away from the city."

Stayed a few nights","Oh. My. GOODNESS!!! Jim is a great host! We surely didn't expect the bakery sweets and cookies that were present at check in. All of Jim's animal friends are so friendly! They all love attention and you can tell they get lots of it regularly. Oh, the pair of piggies... you have to meet them! They love scritches and scratches and carry on whole conversations with you! The ranchhouse is far enough from the sweet critters to be quiet, but close enough for a short walk to visit. The house itself is so cozy and clean! I feel like we will be bringing more visitors to Curly's Ranchhouse. I honestly loved it here. I felt better here. Tech free except for the music we streamed on a small speaker. A peaceful puzzle and reading weekend, sprinkled with sweet animals. Perfection."

Far enough from the city to enjoy a beautiful country night under the stars without the light pollution but close enough to make a few store runs for the supplies needed. My wife and I needed a date night and it hit the spot. Great environment with all kinds of beautiful animals to interact with. 10/10 recommend...we will be back with the little ones next time. They would absolutely enjoy it.

Upon entry it was clean and comfortable. we got in late so we ate, took a walk to see what we could see, hung out a bit and went to bed. Which were VERY comfortable.
my husband and i had so much fun walking and meeting the horses in the morning with the kids - a little disappointed my husband said I cannot have a mini horse but I'll work on that!
Jim your property is amazing! Thank you for a great nights sleep and a super cool morning!"

There is no WiFi (which wasn’t too big of a hassle as we used our cell phones hotspot), we also drove into Van (30ish minutes away) for dinner."

The beds were very comfortable, check-in was seamless and the photos online were exactly the way the house presented. Waking up and looking out over the land from the front porch was awe-inspiring. It was so nice to be away from the city life for a day and decompress. My absolute favorite was taking a stroll down the little road to see all of the animals they care for. Would highly recommend staying here anytime over a hotel. Thank you for sharing this little slice of heaven."

Stayed with kids","10 minutes from lake Athens
15 minutes from the city of Athens with a Walmart and tons of restaurants
30 minutes to canton for trade days.
However while here you won’t even realize how close you are to all that stuff. It’s very private and quiet.
There is no internet so you must be wanting to disconnect a little bit coming here.
For my wife’s and I jobs and personal life we have 4 phones amongst 3 carriers. Verizon did horrible couldn’t even make a phone call or text. T-Mobile could text words but not pics and internet would not work. AT&T faired the best with full ability to do everything.

Stayed with kids","100% going back to stay at Jim’s place (Curly’s Ranch). This was our first Air BnB to book and stay and we had the PERFECT first experience. The only downfall is that we didn’t have more time. The home was perfect for our family of 3 with 2 bedrooms and 2 full baths, very clean and stocked with everything you would need (except the food). Carol sent cookies, granola bars and homemade bread waiting for us when we arrived. That was a nice touch and tasty. The view of the sunrise was beautiful too. Jim was such a great host and showed us around the ranch, chatted with us, and let us interact with the ponies and goats (no piggies right now), but my daughter could not get enough time with the ponies and goats. We spent HOURS with the animals and were able to get so many fun photos. If you are in East Texas do not pass up this GEM! Peaceful, land to roam around on, fire pit for s’mores or just conversation, board games, cozy home & everything you need for a great stay at a great price."

Stayed one night","Nicely decorated place out in the country. Good A/C, and one of the easiest checkouts of any BnB place we've stayed, which is a bonus for us!
A couple negatives, and we have passed this message on to management - the Master bedroom mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable. (But the second bedroom mattress was great, according to our adult daughter.)
There is a traditional coffee maker only. But since we bring our own with us, that was not a problem for us. The internet was sluggish, and our Verizon phones were iffy.
However, we would recommend this stay, especially if they update the Master mattress and you don't need fast internet."

I highly recommend for some clean country air, quiet evenings, fun with goats and horses, and relaxation on the front porch. Nearby Athens offers stores and a small lake, plus the Athens Scuba Park. Athens Brewing Company has one of the best Double IPAs we've ever had called the Big DIPA (we bought a growler to take home)."

It was great. Jim and Carol are awesome and so patient to answer all kinds of questions about goats, mini-horses, Texas, etc ... It was a fantastic spot for us to stay. Way better than a hotel!! If you are staying in the Murchison area, Curlys ranch is a no-brainer. We will miss feather greeting us each morning 🙂. Thx Jim & Carol!"

The hospitality is absolutely amazing (pastries upon arrival and morning feeds with the cute goats and horses) and the cabin is equipped with everything you could possibly need and more. It is very family friendly (sand pit and toys available) and the leisure walks around the property offer breathtaking views. I absolutely adore this place and highly recommend it. If you are like me and pour over every single review; save yourself some time and let this be the one to convince you to book. You will not regret it."

From 9 to 90, this place is fit for young and old. My parents fell in love with this little spot as we make our seasonal trips from north to south along with the snowbirds. We enjoy something different each and every time."

Also, it’s very well stocked with the basics so you don’t have to grocery shop for every little thing to stock a kitchen. This has become our first choice when visiting this part of Texas!"

First of all, the location was so easy to find and quiet. It felt so safe and peaceful, especially with it just being my Son and I. The house itself was so cute and the bed was so comfy! We loved the fresh baked cookies and sweet rolls provided. My Son was a little thrown off with no Netflix or Wi-fi at first, but we ended our night playing the board games provided and reconnecting without our phones. For a mom of a pre-teen, that’s pretty amazing!
Now the best part, the ANIMALS!!! Carol was so sweet to take us around to meet the goats and mini-horses and show us their beautiful land. I was so grateful that she let us meet and pet their horses and take plenty of photos. You can see all the animals are loved and well taken care of. Waking up in the morning and seeing mini horses and goats directly outside my window was so amazing.
We came to stay at Curly’s Ranch to visit the Polar Express but we already have plans to return with my Husband and Daughter, just to visit the ranch alone!
This is a great value for the experience you will have here. I can’t recommend it enough and look forward to visiting again!"

We cannot wait to go back and visit when the weather is not so rainy.

Stayed over a week","First of all, everything was to par, the only reason I gave 4 starts at the price part is the bunk beds room, it was maybe not up to level as to the rest of the house, but nevertheless, the overall, everything else was outstanding, I was there for work so , I’m sure if my staying was for vacation, it would have been much better, so yes the price a bit high, but it would be really hard and almost impossible to get a house at this price in such area as this one, and at a comfort level hard to match, I stay at many airb&b locations and this one has been by far at the top of the list as far as overall awesomeness, thanks"

We really enjoyed the back patio which faced the neighborhood lake. We didn't have time to play with the water toys provided because we took a couple of excursions instead, the East Texas Arboretum and blackberries and blueberries picking at Echo Springs Blueberries Farm. Tamara and Robert live next door, after a warm welcome from them, they left us alone except when we needed candles due to a storm taking out power for a short time they were available by text and quickly replied to any questions. Thank you both for sharing your space with us."

The bed was so comfortable, and there was everything we needed to cook with. So many kitchen necessities and also a great propane grill outside. There are several kayaks, fishing boats, a paddle boat and so many more things that you can do at this place. It was so beautiful to wake up and see ducks swimming and chickens walking by. There’s plenty of seating outside.
It was very easy for us to find their location. They have done a great job making sure their location stands out. It is very welcoming and well decorated.
We enjoyed visiting with both Tamara and Bob and we would definitely return for another stay. T

There's firewood and a small garage with a full-size fridge. There's a canoe, kayak, and Jonboat with a small pier. The lake is right out front for fishing and swimming and 2 lounging hammocks.

The beds are comfortable, the ac is cold, wifi is fast, everything was clean and in working order.

Second, they had all the little extras like pantry staples, professional shampoo & conditioner, B+BW hand soap, body wash, etc. They went above and beyond with the treats: a s'mores bar, homemade candied nuts, and soap crafted by Tamara herself. Beyond that, there were helpful instructions strategically placed around the home so we knew exactly what was for us and how to use it. Additionally, all the water toys you see in the listing? Those were available for us to use freely: a Jon boat, two SUPs, a peddle boat, a couple of kayaks, and a plethora of floats. We brought our own fishing gear, but they had that available, too. Tamara and Robert live right next store, so they were easily accessible if we needed them. They are so kind and hospitable and we felt right at home and well taken care of in their space. We'll be recommending this one to friends and family & it will be going on our return list!"

The listing is accurate. Everything you see is available for use and they happily encourage it. There is plenty of things/supplies readily available if you leave something at home on accident. The house has plenty of room and is in great shape. The property is surrounded by decent people so if you are a partier, be respectful of the peace and quiet. Quietness/peacefulness is abundant at their property. The stench of city life washes away with every minute that passes. We took our blind dog and they were very accepting. We did our best to respect their property and they did so towards us. We will be visiting again!"

They provide everything needed, kayaks, trolling boat, stand up paddle board and a paddle boat! Two nice socks to fish off of. I could go in and on. I promise if you try this pl e you will not be disappointed!!!"

Very clean and cozy. We had everything we could possibly need and more. We were met with such warm welcome and hospitality and lots of wonderful little activities and games for kiddos. We will definitely be back but not soon enough. I cannot say enough about this wonderful property and would give 10 stars if I could. Overall just above and beyond hosts and amenities. Terrific little vacation! Thanks so much & God bless : )

Stayed a few nights","Wow!
You can expect a lakeside getaway and a chance to unplug. There are swings, a hammock, chairs by a fire pit to relax after an active day. Ducks, chickens and hummingbirds are plentiful. We grilled most nights on a grill provided to us by the hosts. There are plenty of games and activities such as cornhole, yard Yahtzee,canoes, paddle boats and fishing right out the back door.
The loft has 3 twin beds. The master bedroom has a full size bed. Their is a kitchen and full size refrigerator and freezer. This is such a great thing since you can just bring anything you would need to cook.
There were small touches such as a card and champagne when my husband and I arrived for our honeymoon, s’mores kit, candied nuts and a dozen farm fresh eggs! My favorite: they are fully stocked on coffee. Enjoy!"

Stayed with kids","The Mini Metal Moonshine Mansion exceeded our expectations! This little secluded slice of paradise was easily accessible from DFW. It provided us a great getaway from our responsibilities. It was tastefully decorated in true wilderness themes and sprinkled with modern touches. Being right on the lake provides us opportunities for catching fish, swimming, and boating. My daughter took joy in fishing throughout the day (catch and release). My son enjoyed laying in the hammock watching the ducks and roasting smores. They both were excited to use the kayaks and paddle boat! The next door neighbor has chickens and I had the joy of feeding them and purchasing fresh eggs to take back home. But what was the best part of the trip was the hospitality provided by Tamara and Robert. They greeted us when we arrived and made themselves available throughout. Robert passed down some great knowledge
to my kids about the fish in the lake and boating. They provided homemade soap that Tamara made that smelled so heavenly! Candied nuts from local vendors. Farm fresh eggs to use. Fixings to make smores. And since it was my son's birthday, they surprised him with a balloon. Those special touches made this trip even more special. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","First I’ll address how it was not difficult to find the place, absolutely loved the huge decorated outside Christmas tree at the entrance. Parking was perfectly close and finding the door, entering the code and getting inside was super easy since all the info was sent over in advance of arrival. I also like that I received a text so if I needed her I didn’t need to search for anything at all. We were greeted within a few minutes of getting in which was also great in case we had any issues I feel we would have had help right away.
Now let’s talk about how cute it was inside. It has the feel of a cabin, but it’s a tiny home and it doesn’t feel cramped at all. The pics are all accurate and every bed was a great night sleep for the kids and adults. The amenities were beyond my expectations as there was snacks, hot cocoa, s’mores and even homemade pecans & nuts gift to welcome us. In the bathroom there was a homemade soap by the hosts and different types of shampoo which is great if you forgot to bring yours. There was plenty of towels, extra bedding and even throw blankets for extra comfort and feels of home.
Since we arrived after dark we didn’t see the gorgeous view til the next morning but wow it was really nice. It stormed and rained most of the night but it wasn’t too loud or scary for the kids which was my first thought when I heard the storm start. We were told of many things we could do on the water and offered their water toys but we had plans to go to The Polar Express and did not play in the water. I did see games in the garage and in the pantry, my son was happy to play some battleship and a puzzle so that was a score!
Overall everything about this place was cozy and I would definitely return if in the area or passing through seeking a place to pause. I travel lots for work and sometimes vacations and I’ve seen lots of rentals, this would be at the top of my list of faves because it literally had anything I might need or want to feel like home."

The lake is beautiful and feels very remote, but it’s only a 10 minute drive from restaurants and grocery stores. Included in our stay was access to the lake and use of the many watercraft that Robert and Tamara have on the property. Robert was very helpful with fishing tips and Tamara took us to feed the ducks and look at the chickens next door. Simply put, our stay was awesome."

We had fun just sitting on the porch watching the ducks and chickens, playing with the cat or walking around looking at all the different plants and bugs we could find. That’s not including the abundance of board games, yard games and water toys. But the 3 year old was more excited about climbing the loft stairs to play in the “hideout”. Special thanks to the sweet neighbor, Debbie, for letting us hold the baby chick and feed the chickens!! We are already planning our next trip. :)"

Group trip","The Mini Metal Moonshine Mansion far exceeded our expectations. Every consideration has been given to creature comforts, games, water toys, comfy sleeping... seriously. Tamara and Robert have thought of everything. We've stayed at a lot of AirBNB's over the years. This was hands down and unanimously our family's favorite place. It's peaceful and serene sitting on the porch looking out over the lake. The assortment of things to use on and in the water is fantastic. And then there's the outdoor shower to rinse off before heading into whatever comes next. There's even a clothes line to hang your swimsuits so they'll be ready to go the next time you are. We loved Athens and the surrounding area as well. Our granddaughters got to pick blueberries and enjoyed shopping in all the local shops. We especially enjoyed Barbara's Corner on the square, and The Wagon Wheel Antique Mall just the next town over. We ate out twice; once at Roma's Italian, and the other at El Arroyo. The food was excellent at both restaurants and the people were really nice. I could go on because there are just so many wonderful things to say about this home but I will leave it at we would love to come and stay again. Thanks for helping us make some wonderful memories!"

My family and I enjoyed our stay so much! We all slept in the loft upstairs (we have a 3 & 7 year old!) and surprisingly, the beds were sooo comfortable! Everything we needed was at our fingertips during the trip! There were games for the kids, books, toys, snacks, and even fresh eggs in the fridge when we arrived! We loved the S’mores kit! We roasted s’mores every night at the fire pit! The porch is the perfect place for a cup of coffee with a view! We loved fishing off the dock (my kids both caught fish!) and my son, especially loved the kayaks! We went out as a family in the paddle boat and the fishing boat- it was so much fun! Tamara and her husband were incredible hosts- they were so kind and truly went above and beyond to make our stay so special! The kids loved all the animals around outside- the chickens, ducks, cats (Millie especially!), and of course, the horse and donkey!!! We made so many incredible family memories. We did not want to leave!! We can’t wait to come back and visit Tamara & Robert and stay at their incredible little mansion by the lake!!!"

She left little notes around the house that were helpful and gave us some suggestions for shopping and eating in Athens.

That said, bc of the description and picture ambience, we did indeed decide to take our chances on Tamara's Mini Metal Moonshine Mansion. And man, we are soooo glad we did. There is literally no stone left unturned of the hospitality extended and fun to be had. The bathroom surprisingly was such not a big deal to share between the 4 of us and there is plenty of room to spread out in the barndominum and so much to do outside. Watching the chickens, turtles in the lake, fish from the bank, standup paddle boards, corn hole or feed the ducks, etc etc etc there is entertainment galore. This place should definitely be on your list to visit...we'll be back and we typically never go to the same place twice. Hint: Buy some free range eggs from the neighbor next door!!"

Why go to Thailand or Maui when you have the best here? Seriously! The hospitality was exceptional! So many positives but a few of my faves were: Beds comfy, games for kids and adults, treats and bedding/crates for dogs, sound machines (white noise), body wash and shampoo provided, fully stocked kitchen, cornhole game, kayaks/peddle boat and stand up paddle boards available for use, you’re steps from the lake, hammock by the lake, fire pit with stuff to make s’mores, grill, plenty of outdoor seating, the view and setting is serene, duck food, the neighbor nextdoor even left farm fresh eggs for us and let me tell you, they were the BEST eggs I have ever eaten. Tamara surprised us with fresh strawberries from her garden 🍓 she also brought me a stain stick for some clothes that had gotten dirty after I mentioned I’d forgotten mine at home. I could literally go on forever about how great this place was and how even better the hosts and hospitality was but I should let you see for yourself! Enjoy!"

The home was incredibly clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The property is absolutely beautiful, and very relaxing. I will definitely be going back next time I am close by, and recommending her place to friend's in Texas."

Stayed with kids","We decided last minute to find a little cabin in the woods to take our boys fishing instead of a weekend of “go, go, go”. That was the best decision we have ever made! And this Mini Metal Moonshine Mansion was exactly where we needed to be! Robert and Tamara are amazing hosts and great people! They thought of everything for their cabin and we didn’t need to bring most of what we brought. There are ducks and chickens to watch (and maybe the kids ran after them a few times). The lake is so peaceful. It was the best vacation we’ve ever taken. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and cannot wait to go back!"

Stayed a few nights","Hi Tamara! As we shared this morning, it was truly a delight to stay in your tiny home! I sooo appreciate cleanliness (even before covid) and found it to not just be well organized, but truly clean. I was looking for something under the bathroom sink...can't remember what...but came across your cleaning checklist and thought wow! we are so blessed to stay with such a caring hostess! THANK YOU! :)
The eggs, tea, ear plugs, plastic baggies, fans & noise machines, nuts, outside shower, blankets, seasonings, info book...all well thought out details/special touches that we appreciated having on hand.
After we left, we did remember 2 things that we had commented could be useful. A mirror in the downstairs bedroom, maybe on the back of the door or closet door, would come in handy. An upstairs mirror would be nice too, for that matter, perhaps between the can lights.
We also noticed while kayaking that some homes' water front areas had a little under water step for getting in/out of the lake. That could be useful for getting in and out of the kayaks too! Your neighbor with the chickens has a great lake entrance if you want to see what we saw. We did make it in and out, and no doubt others will too! It just required some special balance that we didn't know we were capable of haha
All in all...super great! Thank you, again! We'll be back."

I was able to receive the solace and rest I needed. I appreciated the request to remove shoes prior to entering.

Only drawback was that it wasn't as peaceful as I expected due to the road being right behind us (not a deal breaker, road isn't too busy).

Stayed a few nights","The Casita was clean and looked new. It was exactly what is shown in the pictures. For as small as it is, it didn't feel small and it was nicely decorated. Communication was great with easy check in. It is very close to the road although you can't see it due to the trees. I could hear some road noise early morning as I am an extremely light sleeper but there was not much traffic overnight. Overall it was a nice stay for a quick getaway."

The amenities looked new and were high quality, the kitchen had everything I needed to cook, and I loved how the hosts had such an eye for detail—from books that showcased the vibe of the place to the softest blanket on the comfy but firm bed. This is definitely one of my favorite stays out of the countless places my partner and I have visited!"

Stayed a few nights","Nathan’s “Selah” was a perfect place of rest and reset. I had everything I needed for a little sabbatical out of town. Not too far but just far enough from the crazy pace of Dallas. I absolutely loved my casita. The only thing I would have changed would have been a dark, drizzly Saturday because I really was excited to use the cute wrap around porch and sit back in one of the fabulous Adirondack chairs around the fire pit.
Athens proved to be a fun little stop in the rain. I hung out for a while at Calloways Coffee and popped into a nicely done antique store downtown. Friendly service everywhere I went. I was made to feel like family.
Selah is a special little setting. Nathan was sure to check in to make sure I was comfortable along the way. I look forward to coming back again and sleeping on that heavenly Nectar mattress."

The place was more spacious than I was expecting with plenty of room for our bags. We had everything we needed in the kitchen and bathroom. I was surprised that the cabins were close to the road, but it was not an issue. I did not hear any cars in the night and there are plenty of trees for privacy. It was a cold night and the hot water and heater worked perfectly. Check in was so easy too. The only thing we needed help with was getting fire wood and our host was quick to message us on the app and was very helpful. I would recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","The property is absolutely gorgeous. It has a very relaxing little pond and a short nature trail that was heavenly. The decorations inside and out are very unique and interesting. I found myself thinking ""Where'd they even find that"" on a regular basis. There is a little screened in porch area that doubles as a dining area with TV trays. But, this is pretty much just a bed and a toilet. It's tiny tiny tiny. If you want to cook something, good luck. There's one little hot plate that's slow to warm and a large weber charcoal grill that was actually very nice. It took an hour and a half to cook a pack of bacon and some eggs on the hot plate. The kitchen area is pretty much non-existent and is not private. when you venture outside the room into the kitchen, the other guests and host can see you. This is a modified garden shed, albeit very well done. It would be 5 stars if I didn't need to cook and the price was quite a bit less. Whole homes are the same price."

Dub and Karen thank you so much for sharing your little slice of heaven, it really made my trip one of the best, and I look forward to the next visit. Almost forgot about the little four legged host and hostess, their visits added to the whole experience. Thanks again y'all!"

We especially loved the screened in porch. The kitchenette is tiny but functional enough, much like a camp kitchen. My dogs loved running around in the field and exploring the property. Dub and Karen were friendly and kind. The highlight though, had to be the property itself - absolutely stunning! So quiet and peaceful. I only wish we could have stayed longer.
I also have to mention, we stayed during the solar eclipse and though they were in the 100% totality range, they did not scalp us on prices like nearly every other property in the area. I really appreciated that and I think it is a testament to their character."

Stayed a few nights","I was longing for a weekend retreat in the forest and this was a beautiful place to land. The cabin bedroom feels sumptuous and cozy, like a magical haven in the woods. I loved having a bathroom and shower and a separate little kitchen and porch. It rained all weekend which made it even more special to be tucked away in such a cozy spot. There was heating that worked perfectly. The only thing that was a little different than I anticipated was the proximity of the cabin to another cabin and to the main house. I may have read it wrong in the description - but I think secretly I was hoping the cabin would be in the forest, without view of the driveway from the porch. But this said, from the bedroom, the window looks out over forest and that was what I needed most. I loved the forest walk on the property and the most adorable dog joined me and welcomed me. Thank you for a deeply restful visit. I can see coming back again for a similar retreat."

Stayed with a pet","We LOVED Dub’s place so much we immediately reserved the following day because we didn’t have much daylight to truly enjoy the beautiful property! We were immediately greeted upon arriving and Dub was super friendly and made us feel right at home. We brought our black lab and he made himself right at home so we can’t thank Dub enough for letting him be leash - free. We cannot recommend this place enough, it’s been a home away from home"

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay in Holly Cabin- the perfect place for a quiet weekend getaway! The hosts were very kind, super cute, well behaved dogs, and we really appreciated their dog friendly approach since that meant we got to bring our dog! The cabin was the perfect size for a couple and very quiet. The surrounding area was very pretty and we enjoyed getting to sit by the pond and talk in the morning.
We would definitely recommend this place to others and will hopefully be back."

It was so nice to have a place to get away from the chaos and relax a little during a very trying time. The cabin is adorable and so peaceful. Jack and Katie (the resident dogs) are a huge bonus as well."

Of course it was a little inconvenient to have to find somewhere else but he was very helpful and made sure we got all of our money back in a timely manner. They seem like very sweet people are were very apologetic and we would love to try to stay there some other time :)

Stayed with a pet","Dub and Karen are THE most gracious hosts. My fiancée and I absolutely fell in love with the tranquil beauty of the entire property. The Holly cabin was the perfect size for us and our 2 dogs: the bathroom was huge for the small space; the kitchenette had all the amenities to keep us and our pups fed; and the screened-in porch was to die for. The 4 of us spend almost all our time on the porch, even in 30-40 degree weather. The nature trail and accompanying creek and sitting area was stunning, and I climbed my first tree during our stay! We felt very safe letting our dogs roam the property and the trail off leash; the hosts' 2 pups were very sweet and friendly and even spent time with us on the trail and the porch.
I honestly cannot say enough good things about Dub and Karen. They were so very accommodating, friendly, and present. They told us the history of their property and even let us tour the unoccupied cabin and their beautiful home.
We will definitely be returning!"

The property was spacious enough to let our dog roam without worrying about him running off, but everything was fenced in just in case. Dub and Karen take good care of the cabins and of the yard, plus the trails are clearly marked so you can’t get lost! The town nearby is cute, and there are plenty of shops to visit if roaming their woods isn’t everything you need in a vacation. The hosts are friendly and their dogs are too! The bigger one really will show you around if you follow him :) This was our first Airbnb ever, and will be our next one as well if they’ll have us!"

There is a bird feeder right outside the porch and it was a delight to see all manner of birds visiting! So fun to watch Jack and Katie (the hosts dogs) out and about ...so sweet and lovely!

Stayed a few nights",This is our favorite little nature getaway in East Texas. Simple farm living packed with the beauty of nature and wide open land for the doggos to run and do what they do best - be a dog! :) Dub & Karen are so kind and hospitable. This cabin is stocked with basic essentials and fresh farm eggs! Perfect for a weekend getaway from the city life. Conveniently located about 12-15 mins from Athens Square. This is our second stay at Holly Cabin and we will absolutely be returning this fall! Thank you Dub & Karen!

Sunny and I have been Airbnb hosts for about two years - hardly have had a chance to travel due to obligations. What a joy to use the platform - even under a New Orleans Evac trip! Our insane gypsie-like, pack everything and roll out before the hurricane hit trip - turned into an extremely wonderful, relaxing vacation surrounded by nature - in such a cute and cozy cabin! Not to mention the landscape - trails - stars above the fire pit and space for our pups to roam!
We cannot express enough the gratitude we have for the ABOVE AND BEYOND HOSPITALITY we were shown by Dub and Karen!!!"

They welcomed me into their farm and I got to enjoy great views, fresh eggs, leafy greens (from hydroponic garden), playing fetch with Jack, hiking, and much more. The cabin is cozy and well equipped for a weekend stay. Whether you want to cook or heat up leftovers, you'll have everything you need. I was trying to do a weekend getaway to escape the business of life and, well, it definitely happened. I hope to come back and enjoy another weekend of joy and peace at Mossbridge Farm! Thank you Dub and Karen!"

The land is absolutely gorgeous, the garden is beautifully taken care of, and the fresh farm eggs are delicious. Our fur babies loved it here, and we were so sad to leave. The cabin is beautifully decorated, and the screened in porch is breath taking. They also have a little trail you can walk, with a small tour guide (Jack, or as we liked calling him.. the ambassador). Karen and Dub are so friendly and welcoming, and Jack and Katie are the best little doggies. Will greatly miss playing with them. Definitely coming back again. Thank you so much ❤️"

Stayed a few nights",This was such a nice getaway from the city. Our doggos don’t get to run acres of land very often and this was heaven on earth for them. It was a treat to see them living their best life out on the farm. The 2 schnauzers were kind and engaged well with our 2 pups. I highly suggest this cabin experience for anyone looking for a dog friendly stay the property is fenced in so you can relax knowing your pup won’t venture too far. We will certainly be returning to the farm the next time we are in east Texas. The owners were welcoming and the cabin was stocked with everything you would need for a comfortable stay. Bonus points for the fresh farm eggs and the beautiful garden. You can certainly see the amount of love that goes into this property. Thanks again for the southern hospitality - We will see y’all soon!

Stayed one night","I was on a two day work trip that had me going from Houston to Tyler to Waco. I needed a place to stay between Tyler and Waco. I could have driven a little further to Corsicana to stay in a place there but I saw this place in Athens and it seemed like a nice escape from the busy city life I’m accustomed to...let me tell you - it did not disappoint. I booked a little late (day of) and Delbert responded within 2 minutes. He was so welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed for an easy check in later in the evening. The place was easy to find, even in the dark. He left a light on for me to easily access the cabin. Upon entry, there was a lovely screened in sitting area, then the kitchen area, and then the bedroom. I settled in, the temperature was just right and easily adjustable if needed, the bed was so comfortable. They have everything you could possibly need. The place was beautifully decorated with lovely furniture that was also very comfortable for sitting. The screened in porch is amazing. The nature walk to the creek was good if you like to explore a little. It feels like time stops for awhile at Delbert’s place. A true escape. I was only there for a night but was able to meet Delbert who was super hospitable and enjoyable to visit with. I will definitely be back —- and will recommend to others!"

Karen has decorated it to be cozy, comfortable, and welcoming. Family art on every wall adds so much personality and the mix/match furnishings add to the charm.
The vanity area lighting is good enough to put on make up. Also in the vanity area, there's a full length mirror and a small hand-held magnifying mirror--two things you don't always find in lodging. The towel are fluffy and soft. (The sheets are comfy soft, too.)
We enjoyed walking the trail, reading on the screened porch, and listening to the birds. Visiting the chatty chickens in their pen was delightful. We were there only one night, but the escape to nature was exactly what we needed."

Stayed a few nights","If you love being *IN* nature, this is the place! It’s essentially a bedroom with a bathroom, with a door (mini blinds built into the glass of the door) to a kitchenette, which has a double door that opens to a screened porch that acts as the living area. That was the best spot! You can view the immaculately landscaped property, listen to the birds, and sometimes get a visit from Jack & Katie, the owners’ two super-friendly mini schnauzers. The place was perfectly clean, well-designed for a comfy space, and very private! We saw Dub and Karen just a few times when they were out with the dogs, or feeding the chickens in the morning (in the adjacent lot), or heading out for the day. They were so nice to talk to. The faux fireplace space heater was a nice touch, and definitely took care of us on the colder nights and mornings. And the wall a/c cooled it down when we needed a breeze. The small refrigerator had the space we needed for our drinks, snacks, and 8 frozen meals, which we cooked in the microwave and enjoyed out in the screened porch on the comfy chairs. Mossbridge Farm is at the end of the road, so you don’t hear sounds of traffic passing by. Very isolated, even there are houses in this neighborhood. (None visible, though!) We’ll definitely come again!!"

There was a beautiful garden and field area for a bonfire. What I love most was the cabin section with a seating area protected with screens to keep the bugs out but still feeling like we’re outside with the fresh air and sound of nature. It was truly relaxing. I was able to read a ton on the arm chair and watch my hubby grill outside while playing with the friendly dogs on site.
Two things to note is that they have a mini fridge. It was perfect for the food we brought for 3 days/2 nights. And, the WiFi works but is slow for video meetings."

I also think it could used a few upgrades. One of the futons wouldn’t lay flat. And that bunk was really squeaky. The two bunk beds in the shared room were also both very squeaky and not ideal for kids who move around in their sleep. The master bedroom doesn’t have any curtains and lacks adequate outlets. Overall it was fine for a quick weekend trip but wouldn’t have been ideal for a longer stay."

She exhibited great hospitality along with empathy in ensuring my guest and I will felt cozy while right at home. She really bestowed care in ensuring things were comfortable for us such as, letting us know she had placed new pillow cases prior to our arrival. She had lights on giving a sense of security while placing little details that can grab any visitors heart and sense of relaxation from a little coffee station to complementary travel size items like soap. It was a peaceful night with no ruckus in the neighborhood, which was a plus!! Great luscious backyard view and feeling of the great outdoors!

Just be careful going down the stairs because they are steep. Make sure they use the handrail. Overall, I recommend this place especially for families with elementary aged kids. They will enjoy a hike through the mini forest and catching a glimpse of all the deer."

One benefit for us was that it was located very close to two of our destinations: The Texas State Fisheries and the Boathouse Restaurant. Also, Scott responded quickly to a question we had about the smart TV which we appreciated. We loved our stay at the bungalow and will definitely stay there again next time we are in the area!"

Their kennels fit just fine and we enjoyed morning walks along the wooded trail. My boys loved exploring on their own and they got to see a deer. The house has everything you need for cooking. The kitchen has all cooking utensils. All you need is food and your own spices and oil. They even provide charcoal for the grill outside. The bathroom has shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers, hair dryer and washer and dryer. The bedding on both beds are soft and comfy and the loft bed is perfect for kids. There is a fishery close by and we had lots of fun fishing there. This was a very memorable weekend and we hope to go back again soon."

It has so much to offer- a TV with any app you could want, a full small sized kitchen with coffee and a coffee pot and dishes, access to the lovely woods, a nice patio to sit on, and so much more. It is so nice. You really are staying in the woods- but it feels safe and nice because of the surrounding area and the place itself. It is comfortable and cute and keeps things simple and sweet. It is within 10 minutes of anything you could want, too! Delicious Italian place called Roma, and yummy ice cream from Braum's are nearby. Great location over all- the drive to get there goes through the most beautiful lakeside neighborhood. It was just a great experience and I highly recommend staying here! It is so affordable and perfect for solo travelling or pair-travelling. It's also dog-friendly which is such a big deal! :) Come check it out!!"

Quick walk to the lake, a great trail on property we enjoyed multiple times, super well equipped with everything we needed and more, peaceful location with lots of space from other houses on property. We also were surprised at how big it was, it fit our family of 4 plus dogs comfortably. Oh and great communication and host!"

We had a family Christmas weekend getaway. Place was spotless clean and smelled lovely. We’re a family of 4 plus one furbaby (11 yr old Morkie) and there was plenty of space for all of us. We grilled and cooked meals, kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. It seemed we had the entire place for ourselves as we didn’t see anyone else on the property… other than deer.
Loved this place so much that we’re already planning a second stay. This place will not disappoint."

Although I didn't make use of the washer and dryer, it was nice to see one available. Lake Athens is a really convenient drive away and there is a Boathouse bar and grill. We appreciate how clean everything was and the nice furnishing. We hope to visit again sometime in the future."

The cabin was very clean and updated, and the open concept made the space feel much bigger than it was. The outdoor space was awesome with a great deck, fire pit, and hiking trails. My only recommendation to other parents would be to bring a baby gate to put at the bottom of the stairs to the loft - They are kind of steep and our 18 month old was always wanting to climb.
Great place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","A super beautiful place to stay! It was cozy, clean, and the air conditioner was AWESOME! The loft is perfect for a nap and the porch is nice to watch the sunrise and sunset! Our only concern was that the sliding door didn’t lock so we kept the curtains closed and put a chair in front of the door. We ended up having to take my husband’s work computer with us every time we left the cabin in the off chance someone decided to go into our cabin. It is dog friendly which was super helpful and I enjoyed having the dishes and things in the kitchen so we didn’t have to provide those things for ourselves! Go check out the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center right down the road. We had a great time there and it’s a good way to kill an hour if you need to! If you’re going for a weekend, catch the Palestine train ride! Such a fun time and only an hour from the cabin! Thank you Scott for a wonderful stay!"

The shampoo, bath soap, and toilet paperwere the standards of a cheap motel. We only got two bath towels and wash rags. I had to request more. In the kitchen it wasn't any better. We had a half a roll of paper towels, one ice tray, one very large skillet and one small sauce pan. There was no baking sheets to make our biscuits on, no oil, no sugar, or creamer. The towel situation wasn't any better. There were only two kitchen towels. The furniture is adorable. It also gets very uncomfortable if you are trying to relax. Just know that if you stay here bring any products that you may need."

Stayed with kids","This home is an older one in a pretty quiet neighborhood with the exception of the high school students that sometimes drive by super fast. It’s all completely remodeled so it’s very nice. It was plenty of space for myself, husband and 2 kids. Each of the kids had their own room and they had a bathroom at their end of the house with a huge tub so that was really nice. The downside of an older home was many doors were super creaky so sneaking out of kids rooms while sleeping was tricky. Loved the open kitchen/ living area, having a washer/ dryer as well as the ample outdoor space to have the kids outside. While we stayed in Athens, my husband worked full time and used the master bedroom as an office for quiet when the kids were home. We did have some challenges with the wifi connection dropping during our stay while my husband worked. The host did let us know she was working on it actively and had someone out after we left to check it out and the modem may have needed to be replaced."

LOTS of bugs. I thought we might have to leave.
No remote in upstairs bedroom so could not watch tv.
VERY narrow stairs to the upstairs with NO handrails. An older/larger individual would have difficulty.
The curtain on the upstairs sliding door was thin and did not block out the light.

The location is perfect for a relaxing “ get away”. Every amenity is provided. This location is the perfect place to wind down from a day at Canton First Monday Trade Days. I highly recommend a stay at Nathan’s.

People who was staying in other homes where vary noisy and. Didn’t like it at all. Washer was nasty vary nasty and rules was way to strict to even enjoy ourselves. They tried to charge pet fee when they never once stated in the information about any pet fee. Says pets allowed but want to charge you out the ass for it . And then lie about what kinda dogs and weight after seeing clearly on the cameras. Definitely scammers"

I didn't realize there's Three of the bigger homes and three or four smaller homes behind it. I would spend the extra money to stay in the bigger house on the Water. I lite a Fire in the fire pit, grilled steak and salmon, turned out amazing. The place could use a grill, even if it was a community Grill would be nice to have. I will be staying here again as I come to East Tx often."

Also the stairway had no handrails - which for younger folk would be no problem. We're older, and need to watch out for falls. I would definitely stay again! Thanks for a great weekend!

Group trip","Nathan’s place is modern, clean, and spacious !
We loved the two story dividing a bedroom and bathroom on each floor. The beds were big and comfy. You don’t really get King beds on rentals but there were two here. Mattress was comfortable and pillow is fluffy and plentiful.
Bathroom had a huge walk in shower. Much bigger than we expected. Upstairs shower had two shower heads , one handheld and one fixed. Water pressure was great and temperature was hot with no issues.
All kitchen utensils were like brand new. Pots and pans were of high quality ! You don’t need that much quality but it’s great that we get it bc over time it will last.
Overall we would recommend this house as it is new, peaceful and restful."

Nathan was extremely helpful, kind, and resourceful! This was the perfect place to get away from the world that wasn’t too far and gave a real get away experience. The place was beautiful, it looked like the pictures posted and it truly has everything you need and more. Any questions we had Nathan answered immediately. We visited Tara’s Winery and when I tell you THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!!!!! If anyone decides to visit please ask for Austin to be your chef and please get the steak ribeye with his port wine reduction sauce my GOD. His veggies and potatoes were cooked to perfection. The wine was just as good. We really enjoyed our time there!
We stayed for 5 days and didn’t want to return back to our day to day lives.
Thank you for making this trip everything we needed and more."

Stayed one night","Nathan's Place is the ultimate spot for a tranquil getaway in northeast Texas. The 3rd villa on the left was so clean and chic. I even got to wake up and watch a woodpecker, as I drank my coffee overlooking the pond and watching the turtles. Such a cozy spot with the firepit at night and plenty of firewood. We were even checked on before 8 p.m. as the property manager drove through to make sure we had enough wood, he was very courteous of our space and just asked from the truck as he drove through. There are lots of fish in the pond. Hidden gem in Athens, TX, and The Retreat spa for a massage and facial and staying at Nathan's Place is a great combination :)"

Stayed with kids","This is a cute house near the heart of Athens, TX. It's nice and open but still close and cozy with comfortable seating in the living area, comfortable beds, and a big table for eating or playing games as a family. In fact, Brian and Sheila have several games and a puzzle available. The TV is big & the wifi reliable, which my children appreciated. I loved the refrigerator and the kitchen with everything I needed; closets WITH hangers for my clothes and dressers with empty drawers, so I could make myself at home; and a fully stocked laundry room and bathroom. Everything was immaculately clean, and Brian & Sheila spray regularly for bugs, which is needed for these older houses. We encountered a few ""friends"" who were dead or dying, so it's working! Check-in was simple, and the host(s) were very responsive, which was great because my husband immediately pressed the buttons on the front door too hard and triggered a lockout upon arrival. Sheila was able to let us right in and update our door code, and afterward, we had no issues. We enjoyed having the Piggly Wiggly and Family Dollar nearby for quick trips; though we recommend driving to Brookshire's for your initial grocery run. We ate at several places near the house, including the Panaderia (delicious pastries & coffee), Shenanigans (for when you don't want to make your own sandwich; bonus--they sell plants, which I love); Rounders Pizza (crust a little bland, but pretty good pizza and a full salad bar), the Texas Cafe Athens (just okay--fake butter and cheap syrup), the Cherry Laurel Cafe (sells premade casseroles & cakes but also has coffee & tea), and Callaway's Coffee & Bistro (ask for a London Fog!). We also walked downtown to Barbara's Corner and Athens Brewery (great local brewery in a cool space). We didn't make it to the Railyard Grill, but I've heard that is a great place to have lunch. My husband found the ONLY bar in town, the Royal Athens Club inside a local hotel. It's clear that the space has been there for a long time and used to be more upscale. Now, it's your typical dive with good cheap drinks and several pool tables. They do allow smoking inside, which I really hated, but if that doesn't bother you, there's a lot of space to spread out and enjoy yourself. On our way there, we walked through the Braum's, which also has a little grocery store inside! We loved the wine at Tara's Vinyard and the swimming at the Cain Center. In fact, we wished we had discovered the Cain Center sooner, as they have a lot to offer! Anyway, we will stay here again next time we're in Athens!"

The home is conveniently located near all the attractions in Athens and a short drive to Canton. I will absolutely stay here again when I am back in Athens.

It was conveniently located and given no big hotel chain in Athens, it was welcomed to drive 2 miles to the hospital versus having to drive over 30 minutes if I stayed in Tyler or Canton. The house was very quiet and met all of my needs. The electronic front door lock was convenient for access and the Roku TV made it easy to access my YouTube TV and other channels. I plan on staying here again in the future and would recommend for anyone who has overnight business in the Athens area.
Thanks Brian & Shelia"

Stayed a few nights","The stay was awesome! One thing I didn’t see mentioned-the stay is within jogging distance of one of the local running/walking areas. The outside Trails are currently open – but the gym area should be open soon as well.
I saw a mention of House proximity to neighbors in another review – so while that is accurate – they keep to themselves. I was there for four days and never actually saw anyone else. Except for a random possum – who ran by the front porch while I was sitting out having my morning coffee. I believe he was trying to get out of the rain. That was the only neighbor- And even he scuttled by so quickly I could not grab a picture 🥰
Everything went exactly as planned. I had everything on hand that I would have expected to be there. The location really is centrally located. I will definitely plan on staying again. And thanks for the wine- that was a nice touch."

Stayed one night",This will be our place to stay whenever we are in Athens. Carolyn and Mervin were very friendly and pleasant to chat with. The house was meticulously clean inside and out. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. Our favorite spot was sitting by the lake in the morning sunshine.

Stayed a few nights",The cottage was comfy and cozy. It was big enough so we could stay organized with all our stuff. We both slept great. It was quiet and dark at night. We hope it's available next visit to Athens.

Stayed a few nights","Perfect little quaint and eclectic lakeside guest house! Carolyn’s property had everything we needed for a pleasant stay! The place was super clean, with a touch of modern. My favorite thing about this place is the “wood stump” table and chairs sitting right beside the water! If you are looking for a place to relax, explore, and realign with nature, you might want to consider this listing!"
