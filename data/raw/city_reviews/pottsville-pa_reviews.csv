Stayed one night",Sam and Mike's place was perfect for our stay! The beautifully updated home was spacious and immaculate and had everything we needed. Their friendliness and responsiveness was greatly appreciated and even helped us discover a Minersville connection between our families that was formed through a friendship over 75 years ago! We highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the area.

Stayed with kids","The house is very nicely remodeled with a well appointed kitchen. We were very happy with the nice towels, linens, and comfortable beds. Our 3 kids put the wifi to a test with all of their devices, & it worked flawlessly. There's a quiet space to sit outside in the back of the house to enjoy the evening. This is shared with the neighbor. She was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We would all love to come back. The purpose of our trip was to spend a day at Knoebel's, a 30 minute drive. This was the perfect place for us to stay."

The unit itself is in good shape and is well-stocked. Good kitchen supplies and adequate bathroom supplies. Washer and dryer did a good job. Internet/WiFi worked well for what we needed.
Thanks for the excellent stay!"

Group trip",We truly enjoyed our stay at Sam and Mike's. It was perfect for our family gathering. Walking distance within restaurants and bars. Only a few miles from Pottsville and the Yuengling Brewery. Street Parking is always an issue in the small towns. However there was always a spot in front of our airbnb with more parking available at the park. It does have a lot of stairs and no bathroom on the first floor. This wasn't an issue for our family but may be an inconvenience for older people.

We were traveling for a family members funeral service and did not have much time to explore the area but were pleasantly surprised that there was an awesome park a few houses down that we walked our children to in the vending and early morning. There was a really cute Shutterfly book with local recommendations and the house had plenty of space. For anyone traveling with anyone that has a hard time using stairs, note that the bathrooms are on the second and third floors (not that this affected our stay but I have found tips like this helpful in reviews).Thanks for a great stay, if we return to the area we will definitely book here again!!"

I have done a lot of work in this area and that has been my experience with all of the airbnb, hotels, and training sites I've been to. Just something to think about if you are here for work."

We were in town for a family wedding in Orwigsburg and this was a convenient distance away with the right space for the six of us who stayed here. It was wonderfully renovated and equipped nicely for our weekend. There were toys and games for our young kids to play with and the playground a few houses down was very convenient. We had multiple cars and didn’t have any issues with parking. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we’re in town.

The house was very clean and updated. I love a hot shower and the hot water didn’t disappoint. The bed was a little firm for my liking but I had no problem sleeping. Lots of stairs but that is made known in the listing. Just worth mentioning that there is only basic cable in the house. We were able to use our Netflix with no problem and weren’t home much to watch tv anyway…just wanted to mention. Home is close to lots of things. Cute little town as well. We would recommend this house.

The front door light was on and the patio accent lights greeted us when we checked the back door. There were toys for the kids, spices in the kitchen, extra towels and washcloths. Bedrooms were nice sized to large, beds comfortable. We had plenty of hot water and were comfortably cool while sleeping on warm summer nights. We didn’t have time to take advantage of the outdoor patio with grill, but it was inviting. We probably won’t be in that area again, but if we are, we will check to see if this property is available."

The house is immaculate in terms of cleanliness and we especially valued the abundance of good towels in the bathrooms. This is a great find for anyone visiting the area. We look forward to renting Sam and Mike's place again on our next visit to the region.

Stayed with kids","This is a great place to stay. We visited Knoebels, Pioneer coal mine and train, and May's restaurant. This was a great home base. We didn't have a chance to get to the pool but wow! it looked amazing.
It is on street parking but their was always a spot right out front for you. The master suite is beautiful.
The only downside to this stay is that there are quite a few steps since it is 3 floors and you walk up to get to the front door (which is disclosed very well in the listing) that might create an issue for some but for our 2 teenagers and 4 adults was not problem.
The small town is very quaint and you hear no noise at all.
Sam and Mike responded very fast for all questions and have thought of so many small touches to make the stay perfect. Highly recommend staying here.
Wonderful!!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is so interesting and thoughtfully styled! It was a perfect base of operations while we hiked around nearby Hawk Mountain. I was constantly taking notes for which of Amber's design choices would work in our (similar age, similar style) house. The only drawbacks are that there weren't great hang out spaces -- the couches downstairs look great but aren't super comfortable. And the upstairs seating area doesn't face the TV, so it's a little awkward to spend any length of time there. We also had issues with the wi-fi: we could watch something streaming on the TV or we could use the internet on our devices. Doing both meant whatever was streaming on the TV would grind to a halt. This was a great place for a vacation, but I'm glad neither of us had to do internet-dependent work while we were here.
That said -- we loved staying here, loved the house and its history. Would recommend to anyone else looking for something close to Hawk Mountain."

I often find rental locations tend to skimp in this area. The kitchen was my favorite aspect. I struggled with the stove a bit, but the other mother traveling with me did not. I appreciated the coffee press provided, but I think a keurig/single-serve coffee maker might be a bit more efficient for guests as well as some sugar and possibly cream. I am a coffee nut, so it is the one amenity I really look for! Really gorgeous old home and they have done a great job of creating a cool place to stay if you are visiting this area."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for a small birthday celebration and a much needed get away. This place was exactly what we needed! The view of the lake is phenomenal. The cottage itself was beautifully decorated, very clean, and had everything we needed. The beds were quite comfortable, which isn’t always the case with rentals.
Laura responded very quickly to any questions we had, and offered us early check in and a late check out (likely due to it being the off-season, but we were grateful!).
We visited in late March, so it wasn’t warm enough to enjoy the lake, other than the fantastic view. I’m sure this place is even better when it’s warm. We did take advantage of both the fire pit and the fireplace. Nothing like relaxing with a fire.
We will definitely be visiting again. What a wonderful weekend at a fabulously relaxing location! Thank you, Laura!"

The fireplace was especially wonderful for relaxing in my PJs, reading, and journaling beside a crackling fire. A real fire, not gas or electric, with more than enough firewood provided. The cottage itself appears to have been built in the 1920s or 30s and feels extremely solid. The rain on the roof made a gentle pattering sound. I couldn't be happier with my stay, I definitely recommend Laura's place even in the middle of January!"

The view was incredibly scenic and we found ourselves spending most of the time outside by the lake. We used the kayaks and did tons of fishing - the lake is fully stocked. We also loved the fact that the parameter of the lake was walkable and all the neighbors were friendly. We had a great time and would recommend to anyone!"

I feel like I’m bound to be disappointed with the next Airbnb we book because there’s almost no chance it will compare to Laura’s. The amenities provided here along with the beautiful scenery and rich local history made for a perfect get away. The view from the back porch overlooking moon lake is amazing day and night with ever present ducks and geese swimming around the lake. We were a little worried there wouldn’t be much to do during our 4 day stay but between Jim Thorpe, trail hiking, and visiting the coal mining tourist attractions, we ran out of time and didn’t even go to knoebels. 10/10."

Stayed with kids","Laura was an absolutely amazing host; she was available and responsive to any needs that cropped up.
The cottage and surrounding area are absolutely beautiful!
Our family really enjoyed our getaway in the mountains!
Knoebels, Pioneer tunnel, and Jim Thorpe along with the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway we’re all fantastic places- all within 40 minutes or less of the cottage; we had so many activities planned that we didn’t get to visit the fossil park, reptile park or deer farm this time around!
Laura has two sit-on-top kayaks available for use in what locals call “Moon Lake.”
The lake, as listed, really is more like a large pond; it’s recently been drained, but is still very usable and scenic. There’s fish and tons of wildlife going on during all hours- it was a treat to watch from the back deck.
Baggo/corn hole, rockers, multiple seating areas as well as a solo stove are also provided; all wonderful additions that add to the experience.
The fireplace in the main living area is stunning, and the furniture in this room is actually quite comfortable for an AirBnB listing; it really feels like home.
Books and games are available on the shelf for use, and pamphlets for local places of interest are available in a basket as well.
The entire cottage was absolutely spotless upon arrival, and the oil diffusers were a great addition.
There’s a smart TV and internet access, along with a DVD player all available for use.
The AC is in great working order and is located in the main living area and kitchen; it is run by remote. It’s helpful to know that the remote comes down from the holders and worked best when aimed directly at each unit. The only down side to the AC was that the bedroom doors must remain open for the air to get in, thus cutting down on privacy.
The bedrooms themselves were small, but functional for a small family getaway. The accordion doors provided little to no privacy, and the first bedroom door was broken upon arrival and never fully shut.
The bed in the second bedroom was comfortable, but the bed frame, while new, was broken up arrival as well; for full transparency- Laura did offer to fix this during our stay and we did decline. The frame itself in this room is not quality. The lack of a carpet in the room also allows the bed to shift with typical use which may have been the problem to begin with.
The neighboring home next door has a motion activated flood light aimed right at Laura’s cottage and kept us up the first night; we bought sleep masks and we were fine after. This light absolute pours into the bedrooms; room darkening shades and curtains would help this area tremendously.
The kitchen is a more adequately stocked than the listing gives itself credit for. Plenty of items for use along with fully stocked bins of coffee!
All of the house info can be found on the side of the fridge, along with menus of local places to eat at/order from.
The only issue we had with the kitchen was that the stove was not functioning and we were not notified prior to arrival; we spent a bit more than planned eating out and carried our store bought groceries for dinners home. with us.
The bathroom is equipped with a full washer and dryer, and the hot water never seems to run out. The bathroom was fully stocked and the water pressure was great! The bathroom door could use some attention, but with some care you can close the door.
The front door feels secure and the check in/out process is super easy; the digit locks and alarm make the home feel super safe.
The driveway is crushed stone and has room for two vehicles parked in a row; we recommend backing in. The road is a 35 mph zone, but the locals seem to do 60; the trees that are at the edge of the driveway provide some privacy for the home, but block views of the street as you pull out.
While the door and bed were minor issues experienced- it’s not something that can’t be fixed. We had a wonderful stay and look forward to a return trip soon."

Stayed with kids","The perfect places for a nice quite, relaxing get away. The post does not do this place justice at all!!! Its is absolutely beautiful, cozy and has every accommodation you could possibly think of. I was impressed with how well stocked the entire home was, with EVERYTHING you could possibly need. There are so many little things we always forget and thankfully everything we needed was provided. I loved sitting on the porch watching all the ducks, geese and even enjoying a nice storm. Everything is very clean, all the furniture is super comfortable especially the couch and beds lol. We felt right at home and will definitely be coming back!"

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed the fire pit and back porch - every morning the whole area is alive with wildlife from Kingfishers to ducklings. We saw a 6 inch Imperial Moth! And fire pit hotdogs or s'mores at night made great memories. Loved the pet door on the back porch so our pooch could be with the family. Plus - everything you need is found in the well stocked cabin!

Stayed a few nights","Moon Lake is a secret gem! Very calm and scenic, there is so much nature to take in on the lake and it’s surrounded by gorgeous tree-lined hills/mountains. Laura’s place was very clean and cozy, and the lake access was so nice for morning walks and kayaking. Laura was super responsive and we had no issues during our stay. I’d fully recommend (and already have) this place for a small getaway! Thank you so much Laura!"

Stayed with kids","Cozy cottage on Moon lake is perfect! The listing is just as described & some! Fully stocked with little things you may have forgotten for you to use. Very clean & super cute & peaceful ❤️ my husband & my two girls 14 & 8 had a great time using the kayaks & catch & release fishing 🎣 plus it was about 1/2 hour from Knoebel’s which is what we were in the area for.
Laura was great with communication too! I would love to stay at Laura’s place again some time :)"

TVs with OTT are a big plus. The view is breathtaking. We saw a rabbit, many fish in the lake, geese, ducks, sparrows and many birds. There's a fire pit with well stocked firewood where we enjoyed making smores. From sunscreen to bug repellent lotion, Laura has everything stocked in the house. The house is just as described and is beautiful. Our little kids loved the house. We would love to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We came to unwind and relax after a stressful school year. I planned to come and do some hiking, read lots of books, and build a nightly fires. We did all of those things and more. We took the kayaks out for an easy and relaxing paddle. We walked around the lake daily. That was a nice surprise and we met some very friendly people!
We took some hikes out at Sweet Arrow Lake, beautiful. Highly recommend. Also at Swatara Park and a little bit on Appalachian Trail. We explored around Centralia which was very interesting.
The cabin was perfect. I loved the art that was everywhere. Very whimsical and fun. The supplies in the kitchen were bountiful. I have never been to a rental with such variety of items available. My favorite part was to sit on the porch every night and just read and look at the lake for hours, watching the mama bird feed her babies in the birdhouse on the porch. Then we would switch to the fire pit and make s'mores. Perfect stay! Looking forward to return!"

Having the fenced in front yard and the gated back porch was just ideal for Luna (our miniature Bernedoodle).
My parents owned the cottage next door many years ago. We spent so many fun summers at Beury's Grove (now Moon Lake) - it was nice to spend a few days reminiscing about times gone by.
Next time we would like to stay at Laura's bigger place right on the lake so my sister can join us!"

Stayed a few nights","We had signed up for the Yuengling Light Lager Jogger 5K and were coming from Philly, so decided to turn it into a weekend and found Laura's delightful lakeside retreat. The home was exactly as described, well-decorated, and very well stocked! Lots of natural light with windows across the back of the house, overlooking the lake. Excellent outside spaces with a covered porch and patio with a fire pit lakeside with Adirondack chairs and a table and chairs to take your dinner outside. Laura's house sits high on a hill overlooking the lake, so the view is lovely. There is also a grill on the patio. We took advantage of the kayaks and spent some time on the lake. The lake is small and shallow but perfect for lazing around in a kayak.
The bedroom we slept in faced the lake with sliding glass doors, allowing for pleasant morning light and views of the lake from the bed. The second bedroom does not have a view, but perfectly adequate for sleeping. The living room has a working fireplace (which we lit the first night) and very comfortable seating. Wood for both the fireplace and fit pit was plentifully stocked around the property.
The bathroom was well-stocked and also included a washer and dryer. Shower was comfortable. The kitchen had everything you needed to construct meals at the house and some pantry items at your disposal should you need.
The house was about 20 minutes from Pottsville, where the race was. We stopped at Boyer's Food Market for supplies for Saturday dinner. A few food/beverage highlights from the area were Pilger Ruh Brewing in Pottsville and The Little Brown Barrel in Minersville.
We would 100% return to Laura's house in the future. Perfect for a lazy weekend getaway on a lake."

Spent a LOT of time out on the back porch which is covered and comfortable. Great place to relax while watching and listening to the wildlife. Whole flocks of Canada geese, ducks and a blue egret call the lake home, and an adorable pair of chipmunks nearby. Easy in & out off of 901 and a quick jaunt to Ashland (Whistler’s Mother statue, Pioneer Coal Mine & Tunnel Tour), Knoebels in Elysburg, and plenty of restaurants in St. Clair, Pottsville and Pine Grove. Gorgeous furniture, comfy beds and all the amenities you need for a rejuvenating getaway."

Only suggestion to guests is maybe bring an extension cord as there are not many outlets in the bedroom.

We spent a good portion of one evening exploring the short stories of one of John O’Hara (who was one of America’s most prolific writers and had grown up in the home) and playing games from the public sitting area. The space is small and quaint, but boasts all the necessities you would need for a short and sweet getaway - a full kitchen (complete with pots, pans, plates, silverware, and glasses - but oddly no mugs), snacks for us to nosh on in-between hikes, a decent tea selection, a comfy bed, and an easy check in & out. Enjoyed exploring Pottsville, though be forewarned that everything closes pretty early there, even on a Saturday night. But for a short escape from the city to explore the hiking in the area, it was great for our needs!"

Stayed a few nights",Lisawas an absolutely amazing host. She makes you feel like family. She is always checking to be sure everything is meeting your expectations and is on top of communication with you. I even discussed extending my stay and maybe staying another time. I would highly recommend this host if you are traveling through the area.

She made sure my stay was perfect, frequently checking in, making sure I had everything I need for staying long term and even provided food for me! Her place is clean, quiet and great of your a night shift worker who needs to sleep during the day. The bedroom is so comfortable, quiet and dark. The living room is also very comfortable to hang out and lounge in. The kitchen is fully functional for cooking. The bathroom has all you need as well. I recommend staying here 100%, it made my 3 month stay comfortable while in the area for work."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa was very kind and accommodating. The house was very clean and she has great attention to detail. My wife stayed here as she completed clinicals for a medical program, and during her time she did report that the host had attempted to access the residence for various reasons on more than one occasion. It sounds as if intentions were good! just not something we were used to.
The upstairs neighbors are up all hours of the night and they have a lot of people in and out of the home. my wife returned from clinical and the police were at the upstairs unit residence due to an unknown issue, but after the police left there continued to be a lot of yelling and some sort of issue going on.
Besides the neighbors and access issues which made my wife feel uncomfortable, the stay met expectations and we used the location for several weeks as she completed her program."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa was sweet and friendly. She is very outgoing. She called and texted a lot, sometimes early morning or late night hours. Her intentions were good Check in is very late at 7pm and there's a $30 fee for early check in. Lisa controls the thermostat. She entered without the unit without permission. She means well but I like privacy. She shut air off and adjusted it up and down as she chose, despite my asking her to leave it at 71. She would shut it off when we weren't there. She would put holds on the thermostat so we couldn't adjust it."

Spots were to small for my truck which most people don’t have a problem with. Found a place out back in some grass to put my truck but was fearful of getting towed. Breakfast wasn’t advertised correctly. Items that were said to be there were not. Bed was not my preference and more pillows would of been nice. House is very clean and well kept.

Although free breakfast food was available, we chose to experience the local diner down the street.
Truly a diamond in the north end of town which has seen better days, Lisa's place was perfect for visiting the Pioneer coal mine in Ashland and Knoebels in Elysberg."

Stayed a few nights","CONS
Smell of the house
Noisy: upstairs neighbors and traffic outdoors
4 of the worst nights of sleep I’ve gotten, up all hours of the night
No cleaning supplies
No paper towels or towels in the kitchen, only a dirty wash cloth and used sponge
No disinfectants
Host called me twice at 10:30 p.m. and 9:30 a.m. just to check on how I was temperature wise
You aren’t allowed to change the temperature in the house without calling the host
No spare blanket
All the extra fees and up charges
The late check in time (which changed from 6 to 7 after booking, I had it in my trip notes)
Breakfast cereal was stale
No “free breakfast” for people with dietary restrictions
PROS
Really hot shower water and nice pressure
Nice sheets on the bed
Number of fans available to use
Square footage was large"

Probably would not stay again as the late check-in time would not work for me under usual circumstances. Lisa was easy to reach by phone to answer questions. The rain shower did not work properly and the bathroom sink faucet leaked, but Lisa is aware and these will be fixed. Potentially a nice place to stay."

There were breakfast items available including coffee, eggs, toast, etc. The bed and the futon were both comfortable and we all slept well. It was clean and well kept. It was near some wineries, the Yuengling Brewery and a beautiful lavender farm. There were good places to eat out.
Lisa was a joy and prompt in returning any calls or texts. She couldn't have been any better to work with. She had suggestions of what to do and where to go. We highly recommend this place...you will feel right at home."

Stayed a few nights","Nice surprise in downtown Frackville. Bottom floor apartment on Lehigh Ave. There are two upstairs units which are permanent residents in this building. No noise could be heard from upstairs and plenty of free parking right out front. There is street noise mostly from truck traffic. Not a real issue as the bedroom is set back from the street. Place is nicely decorated and all amenities are provided for a comfortable stay.
The best parts about this rental might be the updated HVAC system and modern plumbing. It was cold and blustery outside but warm and comfy in the apartment. The water was hot and water pressure awesome. This is an old building so you can tell it had been completely updated. Also nice fast WiFi and multiple places to charge phone and laptop.
The unit is nicely decorated and clean. The location was perfect for me as I was staying alone to visit family and help out with my elderly parents. It’s easy walking distance to mostly all of Frackville and all of my relatives. If you forget anything Family Dollar is a 2 minute walk away. This end of town is looking a little shabby but inside the apartment is like a whole different world.
Thanks Lisa for a nice stay I hope to be back again!"

Stayed a few nights","Lisa is a great host who put a great deal of time and effort to make the apartment the best it can be. The space was completely refurbished with the most modern equipment, fixtures, kitchen, tv, and climate control. Lisa's communication was excellent- a response within minutes. The apartment is an extension of herself- it is a matter of pride and a major achievement in her life to be able to have the opportunity to host- a super kind person. Please do not hesitate to book this apartment for up to 4 person. The location is very convenient not only for staying in Frackville, but also for anywhere within a 10-15 mile radius. While our visit concentrated on Frackville, other towns such as Shenandoah, Mahanoy City, Ashland, St Clair, New Philadelphia, and even Pottsville a short drive away. Parking is right at the front door- the meters are not enforced any more. You can expect a super clean, well maintained apartment, very spacious living room with bigscreen TV, all the kitchen amenities and utensils you realistically need. Very new and well appointed bath room with shower. Everything literally sparkled spotless. Thank you so much! We will be back!!!"

Stayed with kids","Emily's house was perfect. We were in town for a baseball tournament and decided to make it into a weekend. So glad that we did. Check in was seamless. The house has been completely renovated but kept such cute touches. All the bedrooms were nicely furnished and clean! Bathrooms were amazing, love the decorating.
Off-street parking was helpful and the covered back porch was perfect for sitting outside and enjoying the rain we got Saturday night.
The house is on a quiet street. It's close to the Yuengling Brewery and parking wasn't an issue on the weekend with the parking garage (free on weekends!).
For the weekend we ate at The Brickhouse in Orwigsburg (only a 15 min drive south), the Wooden Keg and the Little Brown Barrel. We also stopped for a drink at Pilger Ruh Brewery. Highly recommend all these.
If you are looking for a gorgeous, relaxing place to stay in or near Pottsville, you cannot go wrong with Emily's house!!"

EVERYTHING else is fantastic if your can easily manage the stairs. There were 4 adults, two preteens in our group. Everything we needed for our comfort was there. Emily and Braden are good examples of young adults making constructive use of their god given talents and strength!
The local history and of the area is fascinating.
We will definitely return if the opportunity presents itself, and we are still able to climb the stairs with ease. Thanks so much!"

The surrounding area of Pottsville has SO much to explore. We stayed here for Spring Break and because it is so centrally located - it made checking out other areas (i.e. Reading Pagoda, Pulpit Rock, Yuengling Brewery, Sam Adams, etc an absolute breeze.
IMO the area around the home is nice and walkable - there is food/bev options within 1 mile with plenty of resting places / historical sites in between. Otherwise, it was VERY easy to find parking downtown between the ParkMobile app and the parking garage.
We can’t wait to visit again!"

She made sure to let me know that if at any point of the stay or before the stay I had any questions I could let her know. The home was very clean and matched the description.
One downside was the mattresses in two of the bedrooms were a little too hard and it didn't allow for a comfortable sleep and also left us with some back pain. The two twin size mattresses you could easily feel every spring, though I'm not sure children really mind. Another thing was the street the Airbnb was on and some surrounding streets didn't look so safe and made us all a little nervous at first but we didn't have any problems.
Overall we had a great stay and felt at home. We will definitely come stay here again!"

The studio was very cozy on a cold winter‘s day, the bed & couch comfy, the shower warm & clean. It had a great kitchen area which we didn’t use. On a good day, we would have loved to use the balcony out back.
We brought our corgi and he had his own little corner. Perfect stay!"

Stayed a few nights",We stayed shortly for a funeral in another town so we did not spend any time in the town/airbnb other than to sleep and shower. We chose this airbnb for its price and proximity to Hamburg. It was cheaper than a hotel and way more quiet and decked out! We got in very late but Theresa had sent me clear instructions on how to get inside so getting in was very smooth. The door is very obvious and can't be missed. Plenty of roomy parking in front on the street. We did notice the apartment number was wrong on the listing but it didn't matter with such straight forward instructions. The place was very clean other than a few spiders but we understand its impossible to not have spiders in such an old wooded area. The water pressure was great and the furniture and electronics seemed pretty new. Theresa was very friendly in her messages and even offered to wash and ship back a rag we left behind. I'd definitely stay here again.

I needed this stay last-second on a holiday, and Savas made sure to communicate everything super quickly. So helpful.
Savas was also very helpful during a weird situation I found myself in. Went out of their way to overcommunicate and try to help out. Great host! Just keep your eyes peeled and don’t ignore anything weird things you may see or hear - trust your gut."

Stayed one night","Savas was a great and communicative host. The place looks exactly like the pictures and has everything you could possibly need and more. However, you would be surprised to find such a great place given the surroundings. The houses next door are dilapidated and abandoned, and out of the front window is a parking lot and a tall defunct building. The walls are pretty thin and you can hear most of what’s going on, which can be pretty inconvenient given the place is in the center of town. There are also a lot of drug addicts wandering around the parking lot and street next door, which makes getting in feel a bit unsafe. There is an amazing taco spot a block away though, which has amazing food and drinks!"

Lots 'o steps but that wasn't an issue for us. Parking was directly across from the front door and access was easy. A great view of the Yuengling Brewery from the front window. The loft oozes with history. Just a few recommendations for Savas--since we are height-challenged a small step stool would have helped us in reaching the dishes on the open shelving and a microwave would have been nice. An extension cord to use for phone charging near the bed at night would have been helpful, too. There was some noise on when the bars closed on the Friday night we stayed, but nothing a set of ear plugs couldn't fix and it was very short-lived. The loft is very close to several good restaurant options. We absolutely recommend Savas's loft!"

Stayed with kids","This was our first time staying at Loftsville, but I know it won’t be our last. The location was perfect with super easy walks to at least four good restaurants and a coffee shop. We really appreciated the included parking permit for the adjacent lot.
The loft was just as pictured and the furniture, linens, and appliances were all spotless and in good working order. We had a late night check in, but Savas was still readily responsive when we reached out, and had the air mattress set up and ready for us so we could all just fall into bed right away.
Loved the clean and modern space with thoughtful touches! Thanks so much, Savas, for the great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","In life, sometimes mishaps occur, but it's how those mishaps are handled that speaks to the quality of the people involved. In our case, when we checked into Savas's place it had only been half cleaned. We messaged Savas on the Airbnb app and he responded immediately. He contacted the cleaning person and within 5 minutes they were there to finish cleaning. Savas also volunteered to refund our full payment, which was very generous. My husband and I thought a full refund was unnecessary so Savas refunded the first night's stay. Savas is clearly very dedicated to customer satisfaction and I was really impressed with the speed of his response and his very evident care and concern that everything should be right. I highly recommend staying at Savas' place for this reason, he is an excellent host."

Stayed one night","This is a clean and very special, beautiful historical lodging that's been tastefully renovated. My husband and I were comfortable and able to relax for the last night of our long trip. The living room and kitchen area had everything we needed. Love the original artwork!
The bed was comfy. We're always grateful for a king-size bed, which the loft has. We're medium-size people who can't share anything smaller as we're very light sleepers.
If you, too, are a light sleeper, I recommend bringing a white noise fan (we travel with two, which we ran). The awesomeness of the town-center location means street noise is audible from the bedroom. Fortunately, it's a relatively quiet town. On the Saturday night we were there, things quieted down early, and the last gunning car engine of the night happened just after we turned off the lights.
If light interferes with your sleep, bring a sleep mask. The bedroom does not get completely dark with all the curtains pulled closed.
The town seemed worth taking time to explore. We wished could have arrived earlier, toured the Yuengling brewery, and taken the self-guided walk around town our hosts left us a map for."

Stayed a few nights","Was perfect for us to enjoy a stress free weekend! This was our second time staying at this unit, so it was very easy to get unpacked and go do the fun things we wanted to do and familiar enough to fall asleep easily. We travel a lot and find it hard to fall asleep in a strange place the first night. Recommendations from Edward are always helpful. We look forward to our next visit!"

This is a great little apartment for 2 people. Very clean and exactly as described in the photos and listing. Seems like it might be noisy due to the location but it’s actually very quiet and relaxing. I already booked again for my next trip!"

Stayed one night",Beautiful Airbnb apartment in downtown area with lots of nice touches inside and everything you could need for a visit. Liked the walkability to local pub and restaurants. Did not like the mess of being in the middle of road construction but that should be short-lived. Parking is metered so be prepared to pay Mon-Fri 9 to 5 to park near the unit. Owner was very responsive and made lots of good suggestions for places to eat in the area.

Stayed over a week","We traveled 30+ hours from Sydney, Australia to Pottsville to visit family. We ended up booking Edward's place to stay as it was close to town and within walkable distance to everything in town. The AirBnB was bigger than expected as well as very clean and updated. There are so many good restaurants and cafes in the area. We loved Pressed Coffee!
The only downfall is the Pottsville Parking Authority is ruthless on this street. We are not from the country, so we did not have the parking app. Eventually, we figured it out and had to switch App stores to download it, but it was extremely buggy and sometimes did not work which led to us getting a parking ticket. Be aware of making sure that you keep up your parking time on the app!
Overall, we had a great stay! The value and cleanliness were so worth it. We will definitely be back!"

The host is also super friendly as they recommended a bunch of local spots to eat and or see. The only downside with this reservation was it was a little noisy throughout the night and early in the morning, but if you can block out the sounds of loud cars, loud people and emergency vehicle sirens, it’s perfect!"

It was very clean and had a comfortable sitting room to watch tv. Although I mostly brought food that needed re-heating, basic kitchen items were available. My husband made omelettes and I even found a peeler when putting a salad together. Bed was comfortable and the shower nice and hot. Parking fees were reasonable to me. I really appreciated the salt/pepper and especially the powdered creamer and stevia in the raw!!! I had forgotten mine.
Although I felt okay taking a walk during the day, I wouldn’t feel comfortable being outside at night. Thanks for a nice stay!!"

Edward was extremely helpful with anything we needed and suggestions of restaurants to try. Our favorites were Pressed coffee shop and The Wheel- both in walking distance. We did the Yuengling Brewery tour which was also a very short walk.

Edward was so helpful with clear instructions and then helped recommend restaurants and things to do. The apartment was very nicely decorated and modern and the bed was so comfortable I looked up the brand before we left. Parking was also super easy - had no issues getting a spot right out front. Highly recommend this property!

Stayed one night","Edward’s place was the perfect location at which to stay in Pottsville. It was central and within walking distance to everything we needed to enjoy a night in town. The apartment was one of the cleanest AirBnBs I’ve been in. It was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Parking was very easy to figure out. Parking is free weekends (after 5pm on Friday). We chose to pay for a few hours on Friday (1pm - 5pm) and only paid $3.80, which was worth it to have the car right outside the patio steps. I think what really made this AirBnB stand out is that Edward is a very attentive host. He sent us very detailed instructions for accessing the building, parking, and some really GREAT recommendations. While we stayed here, we walked to the Yuengling brewery for a tour (very impressive by the way), we ate at Wheel for build your own grilled cheese (they are very diet/allergy friendly, which was very helpful to us), and the next morning we had some great coffee and breakfast (eggwrap/crepe) at Pressed. Thank you Edward - you made our stay in Pottsville very enjoyable!"

Group trip","What a wonderful place to get peace and quiet. The house is absolutely amazing! We were in town for a memorial, from Virginia. I could not have chosen a better place to stay. The decor was first rate, the house was clean and inviting. the host, Jairus was just a text away and super flexible. Some of the group just wanted to live there after taking in all the attention to details. The beds were comfortable, the master even had an adjustable bed. The Master shower was amazing. The back patio was a place to be morning and night, so clean and plenty of seating choices. Landscaping was amazing! Supplies like paper towels, TP & other consumables were available, which was a life saver a few times. the hot tub for those who used it was an added relaxation option. Saw lots of wildlife. Just a great place all around. So much good to tell you but not enough space. Thank you for such a wonderful creation! Hope to come back under different circumstances. Well done, Jairus, well done."

Conlan was very communicative and helpful in guiding us to some other options, there is not a big selection of restaurants or pubs nearby but he did point us to some good alternatives.
Also - might just have been lucky, but I parked right in front of the apartment while we were there. I couldn't figure out the parking app, maybe it doesn't work well on android, but didn't get any tickets.
If I am back in the area, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again !"

The live music is only until 10:30 to 11 and it closes at midnight so it won't stop you from getting a good nights sleep. Would highly recommend staying here.

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend this place. Perfect location, centrally located to everything we were doing. We were able to walk almost everywhere. You pay for street parking til 5pm Mon-Fri (easily done on parking app and very inexpensive) but free on weekends. Apartment had all of the comforts of home. Conlan was very responsive to any/all questions that we had. Apartment is directly above the Pilger Ruh Brewery so you will hear music/people especially the weekend, but not too late, it wasn’t bad at all. Stop downstairs for a drink or two. You won’t be disappointed. Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","""A Night at The Brewery"" was perfect. Accommodations were just right for my teenage son, husband, and me. The noise from the brewery/bar downstairs is loud in the apartment (to be expected), but things get quiet in the late evening. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need. There were menus provided for many great, local dining options. Everything was very clean and accessible. The location is perfect for easy walking to many great local attractions. We loved our stay and plan to come back and stay at Conlan's again soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Conlan was very responsive. The place was huge., parking was fine and although above a bar it was quiet at a reasonable hour. We really only had 2 comments. The Wifi was not working which meant no cable/tv. As we really only slept there that wasn't a huge issue and we were able to connect and stream through public wifi in the bedroom. Hopefully he can resolve that. The last issue is no air conditioning. In Conlans defense this is an older building with oversized windows, so it is probably difficult to accommodate a window unit and cost prohibitive for central. He did have ceiling fans and a box fan, and we were ok, but if it would've been hotter, it might have been a challenge to sleep. Other than those 2 small things, it was a great place and I highly recommend staying with Conlan."

The apartment was quite large and was right in the middle of downtown Pottsville, so it was within easy walking distance of the Yuengling brewery and many other local bars and restaurants. The greatest aspect was by far the Pilger Ruh brewery just underneath the apartment which had delicious beer and great live music. If you are spending a night in Pottsville I can't recommend this stay enough!"

There wasn't any available street parking in front of the place when we got there, but there was a parking garage nearby that was free. If you're into craft beers check out the brewery downstairs, great selection, and there was a really good pizza place right around the corner. The brewery did have live music the night we stayed and they went on til 11 pm. That didn't bother us at all but just be aware that if you want to go to bed earlier, you will hear everything from downstairs. The host was very responsive to all our needs."

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I go on a couple long weekend ATV trips every year. We chose The Stone Barndominium for it's open floor plan, gaming area downstairs and private outdoor space. The kitchen is a little small but we cooked all our meals outdoors under the covered patio on the side of the home. We spent nights outside and downstairs playing pool and shuffle board. The landlord is very responsive and accommodating. This seems to be a newer property that was crafted with a lot of detail. Before you go, download and create an account on the Sonos app. The speaker system is both inside and outside. It's about a 25 mins ride to FRO so it wasn't terrible. Would stay there again. Beautiful property."

Group trip","Every year a group of us get together for a weekend of cards, games, eating and drinking. The Barn was perfect and we will definitely return. The group varies from 5-8 and the Barn can comfortably host groups of that size.
It is an absolutely beautiful space and was clearly restored with a great deal of care. Everything about it was just cool. The open layout is framed by hand hewn timbers and sleeping lofts at each end over looking the action below. Functional barn doors and barrels add to the charm.
The bar/game room maintains the atmosphere with its rock walls and multiple heavy wooden doors to the outside. We love shuffleboard, so that was a big draw. Two bathrooms in the barroom, no waiting!
I will caution anyone considering the Barn to make sure you understand the sleeping situation. The lofts and Murphy beds are not private rooms. We knew this, and for 5 middle aged guys it is not an issue, but I am sure some for some it would not be ideal."

You are anywhere from 15-20 min out from restaurants and stores. The neighbors are quiet and friendly. All of the amenities worked and there are attractions not too far away for adults but also for kids. If you go online and lookup the town they will tell you everything that they do for that season or year round. Landon couldn’t have been more helpful when I asked any questions and his response time was fantastic. Everyone is wondering when we are coming back!

The moment you walk in you are in awe of your surroundings. Everything feels so warm, homey and welcoming. As you walk around you find so many other cool features to appreciate. We loved the nice open feel of the house… everyone had their own
space but there’s also a feeling of togetherness no matter where you go. The basement with the pool table and shuffle board brought so much fun and laughter to our crowd. If you do come across any items you forgot from home, there is a grocery store moments down the road and a Dollar General even closer. We would 100% stay here again."

Location is great as well - it's in a quiet part of the area, but a relatively short drive to town if you need groceries or want to go out for a meal.
Landon, our host, was very responsive - generally replying within minutes of sending a message both before and during the stay. Instructions were very clear, and we felt like if there was anything we needed we could reach out.

The heat works so well that we had to turn it down so it wasn’t too hot to sleep upstairs. We played in the adjoining files, made s’mores by the fire pit.

Group trip","Overall, we had a wonderful stay. I would definitely recommend this place as a peaceful getaway and enjoy returning.
The barn is absolutely beautiful! Every location within the building offers a unique view. In some ways, I think the space looks better in person.
I would advise considering the open floor plan when thinking of group dynamics. While the sleeping areas are separated by partitions and curtains, there is more than plenty of space to spread out - outside, in the basement and main level.
The speakers in and outside of the barn are a good touch. The firepit is a considerable size. The stones that surround the pit insulate the heat, so consider bringing a little extra firewood if you want to stay warm while the fire is going.
Landon replied quickly to my inquiries. The code to enter the barn did not work when we arrived, but the issue was resolved within a reasonable amount of time. We were given local recommendations. Folino Estate Winery was on the list and did not disappoint. The only downside was the oven did not work during our stay. Again, Landon was quick to reply, however, there was never a final word from the owner on the matter.
Great experience! :-)"

Stayed one night","We were in town for a family funeral so needed somewhere to lay our heads after a long day. Jonathan’s place fit our needs perfectly. Communication with Jonathan was spot on. He left coffee for us, creamer and beer in the fridge and said to help ourselves to whatever we needed. Beds were comfortable. Shower had strong water pressure. We are all under 60 and the steep stairs were not an issue for us but for some older or infirm guests this home may not work for you."

Stayed with kids","Quiet, quaint place that was easily accessible to the wedding venue we were attending. You must have a SUV or truck to use the parking space (which was disclosed by Jonathan) but there is a convenient parking garage across the street. Spacious accommodations and clean linens which were easily located. Everyone loved the spa shower head in the full bath. No issues of running out of hot water with a crowd of 6! One set of stairs are a bit steep for smaller children but they could easily walk up & down the other set. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Hill House is a lovely historic house. It was great reading about the history of the house. There is a lot to do in and around Pottsville and this is central and an easy in & out of town.
Loved how walkable it was to restaurants and the very good Pressed coffee shop.
Would definitely stay at Hill House again!"

Stayed one night","Jonathan was an amazing host. Very responsive and helpful. The Hill House was exactly as described. Very cozy and beautiful old home. Lots of charm. The home was immaculate and very inviting. Very clean. Jonathan communicated wonderfully. We were able to check in early and he allowed us to check out late due to unexpected snow fall in Pottsville. We would absolutely stay here again and would certainly recommend this location to others.
One thing I will note, which has nothing to do with the host or the home and is only mentioned for awareness, is that some of the restaurants/pub/breweries in the area have closed. As of our stay (Feb. 16/17, 2024), the Tres Restaurant, Black Rock Brewpub and The Park Tavern & Grille (as of 2/17) have closed. One other thing to consider is that Pilger Ruh Brewing does not serve food, but you can bring food into the brewpub (disclaimer - we were there on a Friday. Not sure if this is different on Saturday/Sunday).
Very highly recommended!"

It was in walking distance to a cute coffee shop and multiple restaurants, both of which were listed in the guidebook provided to us by Jonathan after booking.

Jonathan was a great host, helpful and quick to answer all questions.
The location was perfect for walking downtown for shopping, eating and for church on the weekend. Parking was close and easy.
We will definitely stay here again."

Stayed with a pet",I grew up in Pottsville so I am familiar with the area but still enjoyed Jonathan’s write up on the house history and the area. I have stayed at many air bnbs and Jonathan was one of the best hosts ever. Super responsive and helpful. He even left us a fantastic gift basket. An amenity had been stolen by a previous guest and he dropped off a replacement within a few hours on Xmas eve of all nights. The house is very spacious and nice. Thumbs up all the way around. We will be back when visiting the area. Thanks again

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at Johnathans townhouse in Pottsville, i only wishes we could have stayed longer! We came to town to visit Yuengling brewery as that is my husbands beer, but we had just as much fun hanging put in the townhome. Very historic place, well kept and very comfortable. The place is just a dive minute wLk to yuengling and also to several bars and another brewery we hit up after our tour. I am extremely impressed by how responsive Jonathan is. Answering my questions all week long . Would defintely stay here again."

We didn’t prep meals, but the kitchen is very clean and suitable for cooking. The other living spaces allow plenty of room to relax. Jonathan is a very attentive host and anxious to please his guests. He made sure to let us know that he was available if we needed anything for our comfort or convenience.
I can recommend this house and Jonathan without any hesitation."

Group trip",Very nice historic home with comfortable furnishings and plenty of space. The only negative is parking - a free community parking garage was available after 5 and on weekends but weekdays during the day is was either pricey to park or a distance to walk. The home was spacious and had many amenities in case you forgot something - the kitchen was also well stocked with utensils and cooking equipment.

Group trip",Jonathan’s airbnb was a great stay. We loved the included amenities and little bonuses as well. Loved that there was no wild chore list. The full bath upstairs was nice and we all really liked the shower!! The AC worked well and we enjoyed our time here. Jonathan even proactively let us know that the space would be available early without us even asking! Thanks!!!
