Stayed with kids","We enjoyed this historic gem in Valdosta.
The house is well decorated and comfortable. We enjoyed reading excerpts from the letters found during the renovation. We wished we could have spent more time in the residence, but we had plenty to do in Valdosta this graduation weekend.
Rachel is a very communicative host and made sure all our needs were accommodated."

The rooms gave privacy to each in our stay, and plenty of room to congregate after work. Will look for this place again when returning to Valdosta!"

The area was a little noisy in the evening with college kids living nearby, but it quieted down before bedtime. We would absolutely stay again."

Stayed with kids","Great apartment with so much character, I would book this apartment again. Do note that the room with the double bed is essentially the front entrance area of the apartment so it may not be ideal for a kids room since the front door is inside this bedroom. There is also a window in this room that connects to the hallway outside of the apartment and to the kitchen, both of which let a lot of light into this bedroom, so not ideal for anyone wanting a blackout room for sleep. This was not a problem for us though."

Stayed a few nights","Jamie and Sarah were amazing hosts! They communicated with us before and during our stay, making local recommendations and even offering extra space they had for rent when it appeared we might need it. The condo is much larger than it appears in pictures and is very clean and well decorated. Plenty of FREE parking! The location was amazing. A local wine bar does room service!!
Although you may hear street traffic from the largest bedroom, they provided box fans to help muffle the noise. Overall a GREAT choice in Valdosta!"

We weren’t comfortable with our six year old being in the double bed room which is right off the front door, but she enjoyed a little pallet on the floor and our son made good use of the provided pack n play. Grandparents were in the other room and looked very well rested in the morning. We could walk to anywhere we needed which is nice when you’ve been driving for days. Very clean space with everything we could need. Will definitely try to stay again on the next trip!"

Stayed one night","This place was absolutely gorgeous! Everything was extremely clean and welcoming. The photos are gorgeous but show an accurate representation of this beautiful apartment home.
The amenities were superb.
The cons: one of the beds is tucked into the entrance right near the front door entrance of the apartment. This would not be useful for children traveling.
There are no televisions in the bedrooms and the noise from the nearby train and road was loud for the master bedroom and livingroom. I did turn out a sound machine noise on my phone and it drowned it out to be able to fall asleep. All in all, it’s a lovely place and comfortable. Recommend!"

Stayed with kids",We had a great stay. Building is in a great location and central to everything. Only thing that wasn't clear to me in the pictures is the door opens directly into 1 of the bedrooms. Not a huge issue but were traveling with small children so didn't feel safe leaving them in that room as they could easily get out. Building has alot of charm. The front room that faces the street does have a good bit of traffic noise so something to keep in mind also.

Group trip","The space was so beautiful. It is a renovated building with high ceilings, wood floors, and brick walls. While the building was beautifully old, the space was updated and very comfortable. It had all we needed for cooking simple meals, plenty of towels in the bathroom and comfortable beds. It is on a downtown city street so we heard the traffic, but Valdosta shuts down early so it never bothered us while we were sleeping. We enjoyed a brewery (Georgia Beer co.), a local mediteranean restaurant (Mo's) and an awesome coffee shop(GUD Coffee), all within walking distance. There are some adoreable art galleries close by as well. When we return to Valdosta, we will most likely try to stay with them again."

We enjoyed exploring the downtown area and there was even an event called ‘Puptober” going on which was adorable with all of the dogs running around! The town was decorated for Halloween and was very cool to walk through. The apartment itself was very clean, with beautiful detailing - and we are excited to head back there in just a few days for another overnight adventure!"

Stayed a few nights",Jamie and Sarah's February Room was perfectly located to all downtown sites with easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping. The parking lot was located very close and easy to access and the signs said it was under surveillance which made us feel very safe. The kitchen was decently stocked with the basic needs. The bathrooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. One thing to note...the room considered to be the master overlooks US 84 East. The traffic from this road and constant trains all night could make sleeping difficult for some. I would definitely stay in the February Room again or any of Jamie and Sarah's properties.

It could use a deep cleaning, but that wouldn’t stop me from staying there again (and hosts said they will address it).We loved the little down town area and the market on Saturday and had a blast at hammer and stain right down stairs. We were able to order charcuterie boards and wine from the wine bar around the corner while we painted which made our night that much more enjoyable! The area felt safe, as did the building (we actually never saw any other guests during our stay). It was strange how noisy the road is outside the family room area and master bedroom…I don’t know where all the traffic comes from because it’s a small quaint little downtown with not many people."

Everyone had their own bed. The master bedroom has large windows right off of a busy road and cars seemed to be racing most of the night during our stay. I do recommend requesting the box fan or sound machine offered. Other than that minor inconvenience, this was a perfect night’s stay for our family."

Fresh flowers, a handwritten note, bottled water & chocolates welcomed us. We had no questions because instructions laid out were so clear. Perfect house--beautifully decorated, CLEAN, and at a comfortable temperature when we arrived. We had everything we needed--and more. Ample towels, toiletries, dishes, kitchen items & pantry supplies. Coffee, tea, and other drinks available. Host made this house feel like home. Six of us had plenty of room--at the table for meals, and in the living room/kitchen. Plenty of outlets for gadgets, good Wifi, plenty of light (natural/lamps), outlet covers for safety. Comfortable living room furniture & beds. Having twin beds in one of the rooms was a plus for us. Neighborhood felt safe and was quiet. Rocking chairs, grill, great back yard.

I was in the area for Thanksgiving, so had to store & reheat many veggies & dressing. The kitchen was spacious & all necessary tools available. Our needs were simple, but she had the house well stocked with baby items, first aid, washing & drying, linens & many extras. She supplied games too. My daughter noticed that the home may be ADA compliant with no steps & walk in shower. It really made our stay a success. My children left early for Orlando, while we headed back to Atlanta. It is close to the expressway & fast-even on a Black Friday, since there is major shopping close by."

Group trip","We came to Valdosta for a family wedding. We usually stay in a hotel, but decided on an Airbnb. So glad we did. The house was in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. But even though it was quiet, it was close to shops and restaurants. We were impressed with the extra touches in this home- a welcoming note, drinks in the frig and bedside, candy, and products in the bathrooms, laundry and kitchen. How nice to feel so welcome! The house was spotless and well-appointed- very comfortable furniture, TVs in the bedrooms. Easy parking, and a binder of instructions and local menus. We had a busy 5 days, but it was great to know we had a lovely home to come back to. Thanks to our host, Michelle, who made it known that she was available, but did not hover. A great stay!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at The Sherwood House was beyond expectation! Michelle thought of and provided everything to ensure we were comfortable. The house was nearly spotless with a pleasant aroma upon entry. This was by far my best and favorite air bnb experience!!! Should we find ourselves in Valdosta again, there is no doubt we will book with Michelle again. I didn’t have the pleasure of actually meeting her, but her timely communication and personal touches in the house made it feel as though I was simply visiting an “old friend.”
It’d be selfish of me not to encourage others to have the same experience that my family and I had, but I really want to keep this little gem to myself. 😊 Kudos to
Michelle!!!! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️"

She is quick to reply. The house is well stocked with whatever you may need. Forgot to pack something, Michelle has you covered if you need it. She has travel size items there if you need it.
All I can say is, book the house and you will NOT be sorry. This is our second time staying and I'm already planning another trip.

Michelle has put extreme effort in making the stay wonderful by responding quickly, having the house temperature at a cool setting (during the summer), leaving on a light on, providing light refreshments (including chocolate!!) and the small things like feminine products along with other amenities. I no longer have small children but she has a high chair, a playpen, and toddler plates/bowls. I am not sure when I will be back but I would love to stay again and I highly recommend."

Its like you are home and everything is accessible to you. She evens has cool drinks and snacks waiting for you just incase your drive was long and you need a breather to relax before you go to the store. And let me not forget the price was very reasonable for 5 single parent women to afford. If i could rate this with 10 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 i would. We will definitely return"

Stayed about a week","Five stars - The best place we've found in Valdosta. Michelle is a fantastic host who really cares about her guests and takes great pride in providing quality accomodations. This really shows in her attention to detail and an understanding of what makes a great AirBnb. We hosted a small get-together for Thanksgiving and found the kitchen well-stocked and everyone enjoyed the comfortable open space with mutliple sitting areas. The beds were comfortably firm, the washer and dryer are large, modern units, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. The only (minor) issue was the internet. It's pretty fast but has issues with dropping out about once an hour. It comes right back but sometimes interrupts streaming video and is a problem when using a VPN. Michelle is aware of the issue and is already working on switching to a more reliable provider. I highly doubt it will remain an issue and we would not hesitate to stay here again. If her place is available, book it now."

She had the place fully stocked with about any and everything you could imagine. Tons of cookware/bake ware, cutting board, silverware, eating utensils, mixing bowl, measuring cups, wine glasses, dinner chargers..etc you name it. She even provides, a play pin, high chair for the babies, shower chair, games and stuffed toys for the kids.. The beds are so comfortable, there is also a fenced in back yard with rocking chairs on the back porch❤️❤️The neighbor is clean kept and peaceful.. I also noticed that there were a couple of police cars in the driveways of a few homes…That made me feel even safe. I picked this place to celebrate my child’s 3rd birthday and to take her to Wild Adventures which is literally 15 minutes away from the home.. It is also surround many restuarants , Walmart, Sams Club, and Publix. I am so ready to go back and stay for a Girlfriends W4 ( insider for the owner Michelle😂🤣) This place is well worth the money.. I wish that I could give a 10 star ⭐️ rating because this placed definitely deserves it!!"

Stayed about a week","If I was to describe my stay at this house with one word, it would be ""Excellence"" because this is obviously what Michelle strives for.
The house itself, it's beautiful, it's very clean, it is what you see in the pictures and more. The master bedroom has a big beautiful bathroom that I just loved, all the beds are good quality beds, not the cheap stuff you find at some places. I'm a big guy, over 400Lbs and this is something I tend to have issues with at some AirBnB, they give you cheap furniture that can't really deal with a challenge.
If I was to write this review purely on the house, it's 5 stars easily, big house, clean house, beautiful house, comfortable house, very nice area, big back yard, very quiet area.
And this is my problem, the house alone deserves 5 stars, but then I feel like the experience that Michelle provides deserves another 5 stars. During our stay we had this little joke that if there was anything that we needed, all we had to do was look in the most obvious place and there was probably one already. Need a hair dryer, first drawer by the bathroom sink. Need an iron? Laundry room has one. Coffee maker? Yup there was one. Towels? PLENTY. Soap for the washing machine? There was some. I found things I didn't need, like a baby seat and a baby playpen thing (those were stored in a closet). Basically just know that the house is very well equipped. I didn't see a blender but I didn't look for one either, I'm willing to bet there is probably one in there.
Aside from making sure the house was well equipped with just about everything you could need, Michelle also goes above and beyond to make sure your experience is a good one. It all starts with coming into the house and finding water bottles along with some juices and other drinks in the fridge, water bottles out by the beds also, little chocolates also. A hand written welcome card. My brother in law, Sister and I drove down from Milwaukee Wisconsin. We arrived to the house nearly dead because we were so tired (we don't normally go on such road trips) and getting such a nice welcome was perfect. More importantly the fact that there were some cold drinks to enjoy right away was awesome and the fact that there were some coffee packs that we could use right away was also perfect. You'd be surprised how often I go to stay at AirBnB that don't offer anything, not even water in the fridge, it's horrible when you get there all tired and realize you have to go buy some water right away.
Michelle also has this binder with all kinds of information about the house, rules, nearby restaurants, with her own thoughts on those and it's all just so nicely organized. Obviously I think very highly of how Michelle handles her AirBnB and I think the company should hire her to teach others how to run a good airbnb business.
With all of that said, was everything perfect? No, I did have some issues with the WiFi, I was visiting but during the day I was working on my laptop and I kept getting disconnected. I did talk to Michelle about it and she even came over and called the cable company but she could never even get to talk to an actual person, the automated system was useless. I'm not deducting any points for this however because it's not really something Michelle can control.
I know this is already a long review, and I feel like there is so much more I'd like to say, but I'll just end it reminding you the one word I'd use to describe my stay, Excellence."

We had a delay on the day of arrival, I reached out to let Michelle know and inquired about how late the grocery store would be open. Within an hour of reaching out, Michelle responded back that she ran out and picked up a few items that we would need for the night(milk, cereal, snacks etc). When traveling with little ones, this is absolutely priceless. If pictures say a thousand words, the ones listed only said 500(and the pictures definitely spoke to me prior to booking). The house is absolutely beautiful, immaculate and everything that you may have forgotten at home is there. Location is also amazing. Easily accessible to shopping, eateries, etc. will definitely stay here on my next trip to Valdosta!"

There were free drinks in a fridge, little chocolates by beds. Michelle made us feel like home. If you are traveling with kids, there are a pack and play and a high chair. Everything is clean and disinfected. Perfect location, lots of stores and food restaurants just a few minutes away. We would definitely stay here again!"

The extra touches, like drinks and snacks (mints in every bedroom) were very thoughtful. It was roomy and had a big back yard. Lots of family board games. It's very close to 75 and there are tons of shops and restaurants within a few minutes drive. I can't say enough good things about our experience. Next time we are in Valdosta we plan on staying here again."

Our family of six felt right at home during our stay.
The house was exceptionally clean and stylishly decorated. We especially enjoyed the puzzles, games, and outdoor spaces.
Perfectly located in a quiet neighborhood, it's close to restaurants, shopping, Valdosta State University, downtown and I-75.

Stayed with kids","This is a FIVE STAR PLUS home!
Michelle is an amazing host and this home is not only immaculate, but well stocked with everything you could possibly need!
There were two fresh flower arrangements as well as snacks and a variety of cold drinks in the Fridge! Each bathroom was stocked with toiletries, including shaving kits and toothbrushes- all individually packaged! There was coffee (decaf too) as well as a nice variety of teas. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you would need., including paper plates and seasonings if you planned to cook there.
There were plenty of games and directions for each tv., along with a well at ago stocked directory of local restaurants.
There also was a nice pack and play with clean sheets and a very nice high chair that Michelle had a available.
The pictures of this house do represent how pretty and nice all of the furniture is- but it’s even nicer in person!
We came in for two nights for my son and daughter-in-law’s baby shower- who are stationed at Moody AFB. The neighborhood is quiet and is centrally located in Valdosta. My kids live on the north side of Valdosta and it was only a ten minute drive to their home. We spent most of our time at their home and really only slept here- but we all agreed that we will be back when the baby is born if the home is available.
Michelle was very quick at responses and even let us know that we could check in early on our first day if we wanted. However, we were busy with baby shower preparations and were not able to take advantage of this opportunity!
We highly recommend this home, it’s better than a 5 star hotel!! I would rate this home higher on the scale of it could! You won’t be disappointed!"

Michelle extended the most amazing hospitality with a hand written note, snacks, drinks, and several personal touches waiting for us upon arrival. The house was beautiful, so clean, and really allowed us to spread out. It was much needed with naps for the baby and sleeping arrangements for the nights. It was already equipped with a pack & play and high chair as well which also went a long way for us! I didn’t want to leave when it was time to check out. Another day to just relax there would have been fine by me."

This house is a real Gem, open layout every part of the house was in absolute tip top shape, it truly felt like our home away from home. She has extra amenities just in case you forgot to bring something. We went for the weekend to drop our daughter off to Valdosta State University and the location was absolutely very convenient. The area is located near every store you can imagine, Walmart, Walgreens, restaurants. If you are having second thoughts on reserving this air b & b ( DON’T) this is by far one of the best houses we’ve stayed at, She added her personal touch by having fresh flowers, a nice hand written letter and she provided us with town/food info to help us get around. Five Stars for Michelle and this wonderful home! Can’t wait to see if this house is available for our next visit. Thanks again Michelle !"

My personal favorite was the master bathroom. The shower was amazing! From I-75, it’s about a mile to the house. From the house, it’s about a 7 minute drive to VSU. It’s super close to restaurants and shopping centers. I can’t recommend this place enough. You will not be disappointed!"

I travel often to many nice places and can honestly say Michelle's home is the cleanest with the most comfortable up-to-date decor that provides an extremely welcoming atmosphere. She has thought of absolutely everything any family could need. She went over and above with all the necessary items travelers tend to forget already provided and even snacks and drinks to hold you over until you can get to the store. We arrived later than expected so that was even nicer! The location is extremely convenient to all shops, stores, restaurants, the interstate, etc. Yet because it is in a nice residential area, you won't have the noise or traffic issues. Our stay was absolutely perfect and Michelle was a blessing to our family. (Our teenagers were so impressed that they even wrote a personal message of thanks to Michelle...that says a LOT!)"

Stayed one night","We've stayed here four times over the past two years and will continue to do so in the future (if available). It's a beautiful
and immaculate apartment that offers everything you need for your stay, The king size bed is extremely comfortable and great shower pressure in the bathroom, as well. The internet is also extremely fast.
They provided us with delicious coffee, creamer, sugar & stevia, as well as numerous bottles of cold spring water. The icing on the cake was a delicious swiss milk chocolate bar, which was left for us to enjoy. Communication was also excellent and the location / check-in were smooth as always. Thanks for another excellent stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was very very clean upon arrival. We stayed for 2 days, and didn’t have any issues. It’s small but well furnished. The house is located behind another house off the road. That was probably mentioned in the description of check in instructions or something else I failed to read, but just FYI if you’re the kind of person who prioritizes reading reviews over check in instructions. Would highly recommend Melanie’s property."

We were just passing through on our way to Florida so it served us well to spend the night and then back on the road in the morning. I give Melanie's place a good thumbs up.

Melanie's place was super clean and had everything needed for our stay. The decor was modern and sleek. The chocolates were a nice surprise...they even supplied water which was nice. Will definitely stay again when I am in the Valdosta area.

Stayed with a pet","If you are looking for a place to stay with plenty of room that is dog and kid-friendly, this is a great option. The backyard was fully fenced with easy entry from the back door. There is a park with a playground and small walking trail that circles the playground about 1/4 mile from the front door, but no restaurants are close. The neighborhood is very small and quiet. There are speed bumps on the street out front which helps keep traffic slow and quiet. The furnishings are nice, and the kitchen is well equipped with everything you need. There are TVs in every bedroom and the living room, so everyone could watch what they wanted. There are trains that seem to go by regularly somewhat nearby, but the noise from them didn't bother us overly much. One previous review complained about dog feces in the backyard, but we didn't see any such thing; I think that is a reflection on the previous tenants more than the owner anyway, so pet owners need to do a better job if that is what happened."

It has Starlink internet, and every room equipped with working TV with guest checkout-set Roku and cozy lighting options. We had full use of the kitchen, stocked with cookware and dishes. It also has washer/dryer and dishwasher for convenience, but If you'd like to use them, bring your own laundry/dish detergent (or head to Dollar General located a mile up the road). Windows easily open for fresh air and it is perfect for kids or pets with a fenced in spacious back yard for play. It also felt very safe, located at the front of a residential neighborhood with speed bumps and child safety road signs for any passing traffic, and custom coded entry lock.

Stayed with a pet","The home was as advertised; there isn’t much in the area in the way of AirBnB properties, so if you need a safe, clean and convenient place to stay on a long trip into or out of Florida, it’s perfect. Close to I-75. We had dinner in nearby Valdosta at Mo’s mediterranean and it was delicious. We only stayed at the house for one night in our travels. therefore we did not use any of the amenities such as shower or laundry or the yard but we did enjoy the comfy beds and reliable TV service. The stairs going in are a little steep, elderly or handicap should make note."

It is right down the road from the Theme Park making it very convenient when you have little ones. The home itself is perfect. Has a fresh/clean smell as soon you walk in the door. Had plenty of space for four adults, two small children, and two infants. Had everything you need to prepare meals. Had plenty of towels, linens, extra blankets etc. The home was being surveyed to have a privacy fence built….definitely looking forward to seeing that. I don’t have one bad thing to say about this place. LOVED IT!! Was well worth the money."

The entire time, the house smelled clean and fresh. The place was extremely clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was easily accessible from the highway. It was also close to a small supermarket and gas station mart, which was convenient, and a few miles from dozens of restaurants and big-box stores. We had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal as the kitchen was fully stocked with all cooking and baking supplies. Communication was excellent as well. If you need to recharge your batteries and are looking for a place to veg out with no expectations of local entertainment, this is the place for you. We wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful home."

Stayed a few nights","Room is MUCH smaller than anticipated; no third person or air mattress could fit. My suitcase barely fit on the floor and the closet is not large at all. One tiny mirror. The courtyard is not great. The bistro lights wouldn't turn on, it isn't covered so you cannot sit out there if it is raining and its a plastic table with some plastic chairs/dirt. I should have booked one of their other listings. The attachment to the wine bar... I thought that it was just the hallway and there a door connecting that I thought you would need a code or it would be open to go through until 11 but any guest can go through it (regardless if they have a room on the hall) and the wine bar's storage area/staff are in and out constantly up and down the hallway. We came with a group of friends and realized very quickly that we had the worst rooms booked; our other friends booked their other listings and had way more space for not much of a price difference. Location is great; Hosts are wonderful. Ok pricing."

The downtown area is very walkable and has a modern artsy vibe about it. The locals we interacted with were all friendly. We checked out El Paso for drinks and churros and then Gud Coffee for breakfast, both in easy walking distance and both were fantastic. Wish we could have stayed longer. We would definitely come back."

There are also trains that run nearby so it did keep us awake the first night but then we got used to it. The bathroom also looked bigger in the pictures but it wasn’t a big deal. Overall we had a great time :)

Stayed one night","Perfect for an overnight stay on a long road trip. It's a small unit, but exactly as described. We stopped in Valdosta the weekend prior at a hotel near the interstate, the same cost as the September Room. We found 3 cockroaches in that hotel room and left immediately. A roach-free alternative across the street cost twice what we paid for the September Room. For this price point, the September Room can't be beat! Cozy, clean, comfy. Tiny house vibes, with a dash of warmth and welcome. City noises start early, but a quick walk to GUD coffee perked us up. Review the arrival instructions in advance of rolling into town. You'll need those details just to find the entrance. I'd stay here again. If staying for more than one quick night, we'd upgrade to one of the larger units at the same Book & Table Inn."

Stayed one night","I liked the European feel with its clean, contemporary furnishings. The small, historic town of Valdosta is interesting for an overnight. The communication for arriving and getting in was great, as was the free parking. The downsides are the humidity and a noisy entrance door. I had to empty the humidifier when I arrived. It took me 2 hours and mucinex to get to sleep. To make room for the humidifier, they replaced the nice little table that had been between the chairs in the photo, meaning no place to set a cup of coffee. Outside patio is not a place one would really want to spend too much time. A little grimy feeling. Didn't get to visit the wine bar, but GUD coffeehouse was nice. I don't believe the bed is a real queen. It seemed small, and the 12 inch step into the shower would be dangerous for some people. Love what they have done with the building, but in the future might look into one of their other rooms. Recommend for solos with no nasal issues!"

Stayed one night","The September Room was ok for what we needed on our way to Atlanta. I was a bit surprised at how small it was though.
The pictures of the courtyard did not match the actual view of what we saw. It looked under construction, shovels and tools leaning up against the wall. It was dirty and there wasn't a tree in the middle, as pictured. We weren't made aware of the construction.
The breakfast nook/bar photos did not match the actual view as well. There weren't any breakfast bars/snacks and the microwave was really dirty.
The room had a dehumidifier and an air purifier running. Both were extremely loud and it was difficult to sleep. If you unplugged the dehumidifier, the room was so humid you couldn't breathe.
Overall, the room itself was a bit disappointing. If we decide to stay next time, we will try another room."

It was a concrete floor with exposed brick wall… perhaps a vapor barrier and some flooring would help? The smell and noise of the machines made it hard to sleep. It was clean and maybe the other rooms would be better."

Stayed one night","The room was as described. The bed was comfortable and the bath/shower had a fun design. Shower was in a step up platform without a door. Quirky but we had a fun laugh.
I knew the room would be small but that was OK as we had planned to enjoy the town and only sleep and shower. Our room was adjacent to the courtyard. The space was more like an outdoor storage shed with 2 tables. Tools, plywood, and debris piled in the corners. We had no interest in sitting there.
The location was great along a safe main street. Fun alley ways.
Visited on a Tuesday and arrived a little after 5. We could only find 2 restaurants open in the entire downtown! We were told the property had an ‘adorable’ wine bar street side with food and charcuterie that would be open this day. It wasn’t.
Had dinner at a fun Mexican restaurant only a short walk away. Good meal and margaritas. Really liked the GUD coffee house.
If you want a feel for the town I would suggest Thursday-Saturday."

The room is in a fun part of downtown with a lovely decorative well lit alley next to it that leads to vibey city street. Our room had a door to a courtyard space. As we were only overnighters we didn’t get to enjoy this, but it’s easy to see how one might. The connected wine and cheese room which is the street front part of the building must also certainly be fun if one had time to enjoy. The morning of departure we noticed they had the chairs from the wine room stacked in hallway hiding resident’s rooms from the store front. We really liked that touch. If you’re not a fan of a stay in a cookie cutter room in a hotel this place is for you!! These are nice folks as hosts, and downtown Valdosta Georgia has some intriguing shops and street life."

The room is very up to date, but the building is historical and the room did have a dehumidifier. The hosts did a wonderful job communicating and providing a wealth of information on the area. Additionally, there is a shared coffee and water area that was much appreciated. The Inn is quaint and the location is right downtown in an area with cute shops and eateries. I had a chance to try the Southern Cellar which can be accessed through the Inn if you are a guest. It was wonderful with a great selection of wines, tasty flatbread, and a friendly vibe."

Pros: cost effective, comfortable bed and chairs, clean. Nice to be connected to the wine bar if that’s something you enjoy. The snack bars and water is a nice add as well.
Opportunities: the door from the Parking lot to the courtyard may not fully latch. There’s a second locked door but it’s good to check when you come in. The bathroom space is a bit smaller than expected but totally fine for one to two people.
Thank you to Jamie and Sarah for an excellent space."

Stayed one night","Good Airbnb in Valdosta. Unfortunately, we happened at a time when everything was closed, so it was a bit spooky, but I still recommend it for those of us who make a road trip to go to Florida from the North. The town is in full style of the southern Gergia, with houses and historic buildings from the 800s (especially former warehouses and textile industries).
On Airbnb, I think it was a bit expensive for what it was and the fact that we were at a time when the city was deserted.
The room is nice though, but there's a bit of a moldy smell (it still had a powerful dehumidifier, which actually deterred). In the bathroom there were only 2 shower towels and no mat or towel."

Stayed one night","We love to stay at Jamie and Sarah’s places when we travel from Florida to Atlanta. We like the location and we enjoy the town of Valdosta. Last week on our way through we stayed in the January room and this week we stayed in the September room, both at the Book and Table Inn. Both rooms had a musty mold like smell. Despite this we would consider staying again when we travel next year if the smell issue is resolved. I know they have other units available in other buildings, but they are more expensive for just two people. I don’t like to leave negative comments, but I think it’s only fair to be honest for people who are reading the reviews."

The hosts supplied a coffee machine for their guests' use. The downtown of Valdosta is a very historical town. It has lost a lot of it's downtown businesses and the architecture needs a lot of TLC, but it is trying to reinvent itself with new renovations going on in many places. The hosts are very responsive, and we appreciated their considerate manner."

Room is appealing so the inner view is superior!
Historic Valdosta is well designed as well - enjoyed my day of rest in a small town - just right."

Located downtown and next to a very fashionable and artsy alley, with party lights, iron street lamps, murals, palms, and sitting areas, is a contemporary, comfortable inn, where I chose a room that was comfortable and well appointed. The hosts go out of their way to educate their guests on all nearby dining and services, as well as how to navigate the inn, and my room. They were clear and responsive before and during my stay. I stayed three nights and hated to leave! From parking, comfort and safety, to aesthetics and convenience, I loved every minute of my stay. Cudos to the hosts! They care and it shows."

The hosts have several other rooms that are available if you are spending more time and need more space or more privacy. I spoke with Sarah periodically throughout our 1 night stay and she was very responsive even at 10 o’clock at night! I really appreciated how quick she was to respond, I would definitely say with them again and try out their other rooms! Also this spot is right in the heart of Valdosta’s downtown area, you can’t beat the location."

Farm cats snoozing, cows munching, baby pigs chasing each other around the yard.. Our hosts were so friendly and accommodating as well. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a very hectic few weeks prior to & over the holidays w/ traveling to see family. We were in 6 different locations, drove nearly 2,000 miles & were exhausted at the end. This cabin was our last stop in our drive to Florida. We just wanted a quiet place to unwind from the stress of the previous 2 weeks. We were also pulling a trailer with 2 Harley's. That limited the places we could stay since not everyone can accommodate (safe/secure) trailer parking.
This cabin was such a great choice for us & provided exactly what we needed. Plenty of safe parking right next to the house, a VERY quiet and relaxing surrounding & plenty of shopping & dining just 10 minutes away. For the most part we slept as we were just drained, but we did take a nice 3 mile walk down their lovely dirt road, spent a little time petting the pigs & other animals around the property & took a trip into town to shop, dine & site see. SUPER fast communicators & a great place to stay in a friendly little town!"

Cori and Scott went above and beyond for us to ensure a pleasant stay. We would definitely come back!

Cori's property was close by and looked more appealing than a hotel room, so I wanted to give it a chance. My husband was hesitant, but we were both pleasantly surprised. It was easy to find, Cori's communication was great and she added some sweet, welcoming touches in the cottage. My only disappointment is that I didn't make time to talk with her and find out more about the workings of the farm!"

Our toddler woke up to his surprise on a farm with donkeys, chickens, cows, and cats. Our hosts were gracious enough to invite us to their morning routine and let the kiddo pet the chicken. The cottage itself is immaculately clean. It's also tastefully decorated with modern decor. There were snacks and even a handwritten note to welcome us. I instantly left the property raving to my girlfriends about this place! Will definitely consider a future stay here. Many thanks again."

Cori and her husband have done an amazing job creating a cozy, peaceful, beautiful, and efficient space. We loved that it was right on the farm and they even offered for us learn more about their farm and animals.
Don’t let the lack of reviews deter you! They are just getting started with Airbnb and did an excellent job. We’ve stayed at many Airbnbs, and we would consider them “super hosts”!"
