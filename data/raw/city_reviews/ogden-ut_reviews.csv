Stayed one night","This is a great, large room in a residential area with off street parking. Everything was clean. The kitchen is fully stocked with kitchen tools. There are two shared bathrooms. The bedroom was really large, the windows could be darked out and the bed was comfortable. Just keep in mind that we could hear everything from the other room (red) like phone calls and every time he left or returned to the room which means they could hear you ;)."

Stayed a few nights","Arriving to Ogden and finding Chad’s place was a perfect scenario. The converted law office is wide open, really nicely furnished, quiet, and very very welcoming all the way from the street until I entered the front door, and then entered my really big and cozy room. I would recommend this place for a single person, a couple, or even large groups because of its privacy and potential to keep groups close together. The location is so close to the University, and very modern restaurants, mountain walking trails, quiet neighborhood walks - it’s really an amazing spot! Thank you so much, I will not forget this 2-day stop."

Stayed one night","What an incredible and unique place! From the gorgeous building to the beautiful and meticulous details of the antique furniture and amenities on the inside, this was such a well thought out and carefully crafted inn. It was absolutely pristine clean from the bathroom to the bed sheets to bathroom towels. All meticulously tended to. We were so impressed with the fully stocked bathrooms and the smart TV equipped with various streaming services. What a lovely treat for his guests.
He left very clear and helpful directions that were all exact to description. Great location with some restaurants and bars only ten minutes way within a quite neighborhood. Will absolutely come back when I get the chance. Don't hesitate to book here. A++++"

Stayed one night","Honestly, we got in very late and left very early so we really didn't get a chance to take advantage of all this AirBnB had to offer. Chad was very responsive and everything was quite easy. It's also a very unique stay as it appears to be a historic type building and the rooms are appointed with incredibly fancy furniture and other items. It really seemed more like a honeymoon type venue with a huge four-poster bed, lovely sitting chairs and couches, fancy molding and wall decorations, mood lighting, etc. Probably one of the nicest places we've stayed. We were also towing our boat with us and there was plenty of room to park it and the car despite the fact that there were other guests there as well. And we felt like it was a safe area. Bathrooms, kitchen, sitting area were all immaculate and very fashionable. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Ideal spot to stay for a visit to Ogden, especially if attending the Ogden Twilight Concert Series, as we were. Chad's place is a very short walking distance from downtown/the amphitheater, as well as a short drive to the 29th Street hiking trails, which I really enjoyed in the morning. Chad's communication for access to the building was flawless, the kitchenette was adorable and updated and well stocked, our bed was incredibly comfortable, volume was never an issue in the building, and (my favourite part), I've never had such a wonderful shower and bathroom at an AirBnb so far! Clean, very updated, and high quality shower products! It was all incredibly refreshing and just what we needed. We certainly plan to return for our next visit to Ogden."

Stayed one night","I am local to Ogden, and booked a night here for some close-to-home self-care. This was my favorite airbnb stay so far, because the vibe and comfort level that Chad has curated is one of a kind.
The room was gorgeous with plenty of space to move around, I loved the bed and greatly appreciated that I had two places on opposite sides of the room to sit, and all of the furniture was more comfortable than expected! Also there was a laser light projector thing in the room, and THAT was a game changer for me. I'm a sucker for atmospheric lighting!
The shared spaces are immaculate, and just as wonderful as the room. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to visit and experience Ogden!
Chad was incredibly kind, accommodating, and communicative throughout my stay. I adored everything about this stay and can't wait to stay here again."

There is an available washer and dryer to use and plenty of seating around the place. Stairs are necessary to use to get to the rooms and the bathroom which are on separate floors, so keep that in mind if you aren't able to use stairs. The neighborhood is quiet and easy to access. Chad was very easy to communicate with and we saw him on the grounds every day. The bed was super comfortable! We will definitely book this place again!"

The host was very responsive and came up and fixed an issue 5 minutes after we informed them of it. Very peaceful, might not be great for super tall guess as the ceiling can be a bit low in places. Wonderful for staying for a week or more due to the amazing kitchen, large soaking tub, and comfy bed.
Way better than a hotel!! 9/10"

Stayed a few nights","Cute, private loft apartment above the garage of the main house. Large bathtub and we felt fancy in the schwanky bathroom! Comfortable bed with plenty of blankets and soft pillows.
Kitchen area is small but equipped with the basics. Very clean.
Wide street, felt very safe, easy parking. Located at the base of the mountains, just a few away so the view was amazing!
Huge window looking out to front of the house so you can see the mountains from the apartment. Quick drive to Snow Basin."

Stayed a few nights","The pictures and description cannot do this place justice. Tucked away in a historic neighborhood the area was so quiet. The views of the city and mountains were picturesque.
Getting there is extremely easy and really near whatever you’d need or want, stores, restaurants, and pretty much everything else.
As for the loft itself the entryway was tucked away in the back with its own separate door and foyer. Made it feel very secluded and private. As soon as you enter you’re greeted by a very modern but cozy studio apartment. A nice wide open space yet still warm feeling. We immediately felt at home.
Our couple of nights were to have a little get away to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed. As a tired mom and dad it was so nice to come “home” to this wonderful property for some rest and relaxation. With the little touches like a little note and treat, it made us feel welcome and taken care of.
10/10 would stay again."

I came “home” to a restful environment and slept so well in the dark space and cozy bed. We loved the sweet treat and welcome note. The bathroom is in my top 5 bathrooms I’ve ever seen. So pretty!

Stayed a few nights","We loved this place! The decor is fresh, clean, warm and so cleverly done. The delicious chocolate chip and oatmeal bars were such a nice extra as were the locally made lotion/hand soap amenities. Everything about this place reflects hosts who really care about your comfort. This is a dedicated Airbnb space where you aren’t picking your way around other people’s belongings. It’s private. The hosts have a small child but we never heard them but once when they were going in and out of the garage. Their living space is nicely insulated from the guest space. The hosts were highly responsive but weren’t all up in our grill, which can sometimes honestly be a small problem at some Airbnbs when you have very friendly hosts yet little time and stuff to do. That was not the case here! They are finishing construction and improvements around the property but communicated kindly about it and offered to stop the noise (which obviously would be only a temporary problem anyway and shows their flexibility in considering the needs of paying guests). This place is a winner. I’d stay again and recommend it highly."

The neighborhood is very quiet and made our stay very peaceful we wouldn’t have even known there were people living in the house except seeing their car move! The only thing I would’ve liked to know is it is close to an airport so you can hear airplanes taking off in the mornings and throughout the day, but terrible but did wake us up! The host was awesome and attentive, beautiful place, we would stay there again for sure! 👍🏼"

Upon arriving, the body wash was missing from the bathroom, but the host got back to us quickly and placed more in our room before we got back from a day out in SLC. Incredibly responsive and great communication - asked if we needed anything else to make sure we were taken care of. I'd never stayed in Ogden before, beautiful scenery, and quaint little downtown area. Overall, really recommend this stay!"

Stayed about a week","There several things that were unexpected and unacceptable. One example is, during our stay it snowed several inches. No one cleared or plowed the driveway which inclines from the street to the garages. It was nearly impossible to maneuver with the depth of the snow and the ruts to get to the area we were told to park. No one cleared the deck area between the door to our apartment and stairs. Electric circuits tripped off and there is very little space around the microwave. I could but don't want to go on. We left 2 days early. That speaks volumes. This apartment is not up to Airbnb standards. We were not happy."

There was some rule about tripping off the circuit so I didn’t want to use the microwave, heater, my hair dryer, and etc. The bed was hard, I assumed the “high quality mattress” wouldn’t be that firm. The parking area was full of snow and I had to shovel snow because my car got stuck trying to park. I really loved the area and neighborhood. The room was okay for the price, I believe I had high expectations with the photos."

No wifi, they wanted you to strip the bed, clean the toilet, etc. Seemed a bit over the top compared to most. It was clean, well kept and easily accessible. They said they enjoyed their experience but it wasn't the best."

Stayed a few nights","It was a good location and the hosts were responsive and timely with communication. It was overpriced, though--and this is with cleaning rules implemented to keep the cleaning fee low. Guests are told to strip the bed, clean the toilet, and throw out the trash. Despite these requests, there's still a cleaning fee. For the same price, you're better off staying at a hotel, without a worry of scrubbing the toilet on your vacation/trip."

Bed was larhe and comfortable. we were unaware of steps to climb and that was difficult since i am handicapped. the 2 columns were nice decoration but functionally...just in the way. As was the hanging pothos plant....I'm tall, and barely brushed the leave and it came down. From the multiple holes in the ceiling, this is a repetitive situation. most frustrating was the lock to get in. it was tricky and took days to figure out how to use it."

The host was out of town and unable to respond, but his wife was home she and showed us how to get in, and was very kind. The biggest problem we had was that there's a constant, high pitched pulsing sound coming from the fireplace that made it hard to relax and made it so we had to sleep with earplugs in. Hope they can get that fixed for other guests, as it put a damper on an otherwise very nice stay."

We came in from the icy cold to a cozy room warmed by a modern, lovely gas fireplace, a fluffy bed with kissing-swans made out of snow white towels, candies below each pillow, and earplugs by the bed (although we never needed them). The water in the Jacuzzi tub was hot and all was pristinely clean down to the spot-free glass shower. Everything smelled clean, too, without any strong artificial fragrance to hide anything. Loved it and absolutely would go again."

The hosts were friendly. They were slow to respond to messages but answered phone calls immediately. Check in and check out was simple.
There are no dishes or utensils provided either so make sure to pack your own if booking here.
The bed was pretty comfortable and we appreciated the extra blankets and heaters. The fireplace is a nice touch too."

Eat before you come, they don't allow eating on the bed or carpet so there isn't a great place to eat where you can see the TV or have a table. We only stayed one night but it was quite a nice place and we enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","In reading some of the other reviews I’d like to say in defense of this Airbnb, - You’d Be Crazy Not To Stay Here!
There’s not a hotel in this world where you don’t hear a child/person through the walls or in the hallway, causing a ruckus!
Now with that being said, I did not find any issues with children being annoying. By 10am you’d hear a little muffled noises of children, but that’s about it. It was quiet and peaceful in the time I was ever inside. Yes maybe there might be the odd day where a child might cry but not 24/7 a week!
Garret and Nerisa clearly informs you that there are children on the premises and if you don’t like that then don’t book it. I’ll just add, if you do book it and hit an odd day, DON’T complain about it as if these people are villains!!! I find that so tacky.
THIS place is the BOMB! The bed is fantastic, accompanied by a cozy fireplace. The bathroom is the max. There is a fridge, with bottled water in it, a microwave and coffee machine available for one’s convenience, but no kitchen sink, just like you wouldn’t find in a hotel room! What you see in the photo gallery is what you get!
The whole place is a very spacious suite, clean and worthy of 5 STARS.
Like wise, the hosts are the BOMB! They go out of their way to help you, responding to every contact, and if you have an issue, they’ll accommodate you: just holler out and they’ll take care of it… they’ll go out of their way because their goal is to sincerely be the 5 star experience and they truly are.
The location is beautiful and close to shops. Easy access to any recreation/entertainment.
I just love this place! So happy I stayed here and so glad I booked it again for next month. I’ll be a regular at this Airbnb every time I’m in this area."

Stayed a few nights","This is a nice home and accommodations. Good host.
As pictured, this space has a large king bed and large spa bathroom. Not pictured is a remote control operated electric fireplace.
Some things to note:
This property has several parking spots so you need to communicate with the owners where they want you to park.
Clean towels provided but provide your own toiletries, plastic ware & paper plates if you plan to eat or reheat food.
There are 10 steps, not pictured, from ground level to the room.
This home is in a residential neighborhood and borders other homes. I never saw wildlife in the yard of this AirBnB as posted in the website photographs.
The AirBnB room shares a thin wall with a family home. The family has small children who live on small children time. The owner warned me of presence of children and I did not explore with more questions. Mea culpa. There were 3 children under the age of 5 the afternoon I arrived.
I booked this property for 3 nights but checked out after the 2nd night. The noise of the children woke me up as I tried to sleep in the 2nd day. It was a rainy day. I went out for a while to get food and read and take a break. When I came back a couple hours later, I hoped to pass the rainy afternoon reading but there just wasn’t peace and quiet so I checked out early and went to a beautiful hotel for my final night of vacation.
The reading nook featured in the pictures is two chairs positioned for visiting as you enter the room. This is one large studio type room and not really a reading chair or sitting area.
When you walk out the door, there is a shared deck with the family home that opens to the family’s back yard, Children’s trampoline and neighbor’s backyard.
They provide free Wi-Fi, coffee, microwave, restaurant suggestions and walking/hiking suggestions. I was very grateful the host helped me carry my luggage up the steps as I recently had cervical surgery.
This is a bed and bathroom for a great price but it is not a space for reading or sitting outside or observing nature, naps, or any other activities except maybe watching tv, which they also provide."

One useful thing to know about the location that I didn't see in other reviews is the fact that the condo is above multiple restaurants and below a few business. I loved this aspect of the stay because it felt like I was in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Ogden. While it was a mostly quiet trip, I did get the occasional sound of high-heels from above or delivery trucks in the morning below.
Overall, we had a wonderful time and it's a place I would love to stay again. Thanks!"

Cons: The very convenient location give rise to “city noises” like 3:00 am trash pickup. Also, this is a mixed use building with a restaurant literally down the hall from the front door. And the walk up from the back passes by the worker entrance to the downstairs restaurant. Slightly odd. We never heard noise from either restaurant, but we did hear furniture moving from 10:30 to midnight as the office (?) above the unit was being cleaned.
Conclusion: Would we stay here again? Yes."

Kitchen was well stocked with all the utensils to cook with. Eva even had sweet little Christmas decor up which made it even cozier. Perfect location to walk to anything in downtown Ogden.
Excellent communication on the check in process with easy to follow instructions. One of my favorite Airbnb’s in Ogden- love it and hope to stay again."

If you're looking for a place in Ogden and just to hangout, maybe spend the night on 25th street, this is a great place. Inside was really clean and with all the amenities you would need. Very comfy and a great place to host two couples (as long as one couple can sleep on a full size bed)."

The location in downtown Ogden is perfect to stroll the city — yet it was tucked away upstairs, quiet — and we never heard any traffic or noise. It was truly a private paradise in town.
Eva was a wonderful host with great communication!
Ogden was adorable — and they even were filming a Hallmark Christmas special one evening! Highly recommend visiting Antelope Island if you have time! 😊"

Eva has thought of everything you didn't even know you needed. I forgot my toothbrush... there was one in the bathroom. We decided to pack a lunch for our day out... there was a cooler. I needed a bandaid .... there was a first aid kit. The kitchen had all the basics you need for easy cooking like seasonings, olive oil, etc. The place was very clean and comfortable. I especially liked the little bluetooth speaker in the kitchen. :) I will definitely return. Thank you Eva!"

I actually really liked that you could hear the noise from the restaurant in the hallway but not in the condo. I witnessed a neighbor going to another condo because they were singing dancing queen by abba at the top of their lungs at 2 ish in the morning although I only heard them because I was right next to the elevator by their condo and didn’t mind it at all and couldn’t hear them from our condo. I honestly can’t wait to come back!!🥰"

You truly feel like you’re at home when you’re here; so at home that we didn’t want to leave to explore some days because it was so cozy. There was VERY little noise from the nearby restaurant and it was only ever during the day which was perfect! We left to stay at a hotel in a different city and I have never been more sad to leave an Airbnb. Eva was nothing short of amazing and super communicative. We will DEFINITELY be back!

There's plenty of parking and an elevator and stairs. We visit at least 1 airbnb/month and this was the first one that lacked nothing. She thought of everything we could need or might have forgotten at home, which gave us more time to enjoy the city instead of running errands for cooking oil, kleenex, etc. The place is also very comfortable and well laid out for a family: roomy, stocked kitchen, comfy beds, large bathroom counter, lots of cushioned seating in the living room and dining table. We had a very enjoyable stay! We'll definitely try to get this apt again next time!"

We really enjoyed staying there and were comfortable the whole time! The back entrance is a little odd, but the front entrance on 25th has an elevator and is easier to navigate. The WiFi wasn’t great, but apart from that there were no issues. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking to be in the heart of the city!"

With the TV on and soft ambient music in the imagery of a fireplace crackling it was definitely worth the entry. The two person jetted bathtub made for an excellent addition to our otherwise beautiful stay. The beautiful mountains in the background with a fresh coating of snow added to the Mystique and aura. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was a wonderful two-night sleep. I would recommend this B&B to anybody who wishes to have a romantic interlude.

Stayed a few nights","I loved my stay at Stacey’s Airbnb. It felt (homie) , comfortable, and that bed is amazing! The bed was so comfortable that I did not even move or turn over the entire night. Check out is supposed to be at 11 Am, but Stacy let me stay until 12 PM. This is well worth the money. Oh and the Jacuzzi tub was fabulous after a long day of walking around. I stayed for three nights. I will definitely come back and stay again. I have stayed in many Airbnb’s, but this is the very best of all of them."

Such a cozy space- like a homey, cozy hotel room but more affordable and inviting. Lots of personal touches that we appreciated and very comfy bed. We’re dying to stay here again!"

Stayed one night","My partner and I enjoyed our stay on our way through Ogden for a night. We woke up and drank our coffee while relaxing in the tub, which was fantastic. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The only downside is that there was no mention in the listing that this suite shared a door to another rental and we did wake up at 6am to some noise. We discovered that there are two identical airbnb listings for this location, one for 2 guests (1 bdrm/1ba) and another for 5 guests (2 bdrm/4 beds/1 ba). The listing for 5 guests does mention the shared door to the 2 guest suite, however, the listing for the 2 guest suite does not mention the shared door and opportunity for noise transfer. Overall, this place was clean, comfortable, and included an amazing tub to soak in! Stacey, thank you for a lovely stay."

Stayed one night","I chose this Airbnb for location (near family we're visiting), late checkout time, and value.
I love all the little conveniences - personal reading lights on each side of the bed, the pretty, sparkly room lights, a pair of flameless candles - as well as the usual amenities - bedding, coffee maker, shampoo, soap, hair dryer. The little microwave and fridge are nice, too. The desk area has its own light which makes a nice little study space.
The room itself is good-sized, like a hotel room. Nice, comfy bed. Roku TV. Good Wifi. Easy access right off a main road in Ogden, with convenient parking and a little fenced-in patio - no stairs at all.
The bathroom is a cute, efficient little room, and it has a motion-sensing light, which is quite handy."

Comparing to the places I have stayed before, price was probably a little high but would stay there again based on location. Plus, You are right at the base of the mountains

Stayed a few nights","I had a great stay here! I was in town for a ski weekend and you can't beat the location for skiing! It's on the same road that you'd take to the ski resorts, and it's across the street from a rental shop & grocery store, so I was able to grab my skis and snacks and head right up to the slopes. The hosts are awesome—very friendly and quick to respond and take action. It's a lovely space with the layout of a hotel and the personal touches of an Airbnb, so it was the best of both worlds! I loved the quality of everything in the room—the bed was super comfy, the blankets were cozy, the heater worked great, and the lighting in the bedroom was really lovely. If I were to make any recommendations, it would be to bring some cozy socks or slippers in the winter because the floor could get a little chilly. I loved it, though, and definitely plan to stay again this ski season!"

Stayed a few nights","I didnt realize the house was on a main road and right next to a large construction project. That being said, noise turned out not to be an issue. The location was convenient and nature walks and some food/grocery/gas were all within walking distance. I walked to the botanical gardens in 15 minutes. Downtown was a short Uber ride away.
The bed was comfortable which is always my main concern. It was a small but cozy space, tiny home-style. Cute interior. Floor-to-ceiling mirrors made the room feel larger and more open. The bathroom was very small. If you are a larger person or just like more space to move around, you may find it a little challenging. The vanity mirror in the bathroom was a nice touch. The AC was very quiet and efficient. Overall a great stay for the price."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at this place in July. It's a great spot. Cozy is the best word I can think of to describe it. Very happy with what I got for the price I got it at. Nothing to extravagant, simple room, and right off road from everything in town. Personal things I would is change turning tye patio smoker or atleast vape friendly, it's very relaxing out there and would be nice to sit down and relax and not have to walk outside of it, but totally understandablewith having other guest next door who might not enjoy it. But sadly I can't give it a full 5 star. Everything was fine after but when my guest and I were vaping one morning the owner came up to us very aggressive and was asking what we were doing and if we had problems. When we told him we were staying at Air Bnb he was fine and said there were people who just like to hang out there. But i still think there is a better approach when coming up on people. Didn't appreciate that part 1 bit and was offended to be even judged as such."

Janet's attention to detail truly shines through, from the carefully chosen furnishings to the thoughtful touches scattered throughout the space. It felt like stepping into a home away from home.
What truly made my stay memorable, however, was Janet's exceptional communication and friendliness. From the moment I booked, she was prompt and helpful in her responses, ensuring that I had all the information I needed for a seamless stay. Her warm welcome made me feel instantly at ease, and I knew I was in good hands throughout my time there.
Overall, I highly recommend Janet's Airbnb to anyone seeking a cozy and charming retreat in Ogden. I can't wait to return for another stay in the future."

I felt immediately at home and cozy and comfortable. The 3 bedrooms plus 3 bathrooms was a HUGE bonus!! So nice to have the space and privacy! Each bathroom is so beautiful and cozy. Each need or want we could possibly have were met! My family raved on and on how much we loved it. We didn't want to leave! And we will definitely be back! It was the perfect place to stay! Janet was also extremely friendly and helpful. We give this place 5 PLUS stars!! Loved it!!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this charming Airbnb was an absolute delight. As soon as we stepped inside, we were greeted by an ambiance of warmth and comfort that instantly put us at ease. The cleanliness of the space was impeccable, reassuring us of a hygienic environment during our stay.
Despite the gloomy weather outside, the snug bedding provided quickly enveloped us in coziness, dispelling any chill from the cloudy skies. It felt like a warm hug, inviting us to relax and unwind after a long day.
While the weather wasn't ideal for outdoor activities, the comfort of this Airbnb more than made up for it. It became our cozy retreat, shielding us from the cold and providing a sanctuary where we could truly relax.
In conclusion, I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a clean, comfortable, and cozy accommodation. The host's attention to detail and commitment to cleanliness made our stay truly memorable, and we can't wait to return for another peaceful getaway."

We had a misunderstanding and thought we had reserved it for 2 nights but Mike was very kind and even offered us to stay in another place across the street. It was nice to have a warm and clean bed to sleep in.

It definitely felt special, Mike took care to make the studio feel warm and entertaining (like the record player and cozy sitting area). Location felt simultaneously secluded and in the middle of everything we needed - we were right by a great Chinese restaurant and 7-11, and about 10 minutes from downtown to go see the Christmas village. He was also very responsive! Knowing the gps would probably take us the wrong way, Mike made sure to send us special directions. And when there were no batteries in the tv remote he was up in less than 2 minutes with replacements. Really great hosts at a great studio."

Stayed a few nights","I really liked this place. It was the first studio stays I’ve had with AirBnB and I liked it, as it’s more like a hotel and everything is basically in one spot making managing my stuff easier. It was clean and Mike was very helpful.
The only issue I would point out for people is that it is in a relatively busy area, near a main road, a hospital (occasionally sirens) and businesses. While it is tucked away, the house isn’t far from the main road and businesses and it can get noisy at times, like the early morning trash pick up of the business nearby. If you are a light sleeper, this could be an issue. I use white noise, which helps. Not a deal be breaker for me, just something to be aware of."

Stayed one night","We were greeted by a very kind host, the world’s most beautiful Labrador, a small stack of excellent books (Dostoevsky, Kerouac, and Woody Guthrie!!!), a turntable, a record collection, a mountain view, a cozy bed, and a kitchen with very welcoming touches. Combined with a quiet outdoor space to eat, work, and relax, this Airbnb is hard to beat. We’ve been traveling a long time and this is one of the best we’ve ever stayed in, especially for the great value."

Stayed a few nights","Brue Haus is a wonderful place to stay in Ogden! Very convenient location, close to many good eateries and things to do. The space is clean, cozy, and inviting, with every amenity needed aside from a laundry unit, though there are laundromats relatively close by. I enjoyed hiking multiple beautiful trails all within a 8 minute drive of the location. Kind, quiet neighbors. Especially the orange cat, who will try to get inside of the space if you let them. Be careful, they are very persuasive! :) Mike and Krista, thank you again for being wonderful and responsive hosts!"

Would definitely stay again though. Felt very remote, even though it's an in-laws unit in the city. The space is uniquely decorated and super cozy. Mike and his wife were helpful and friendly.

Mike's place was clean, comfortable, and easy to find. The only thing the pickiest of people might not like is the size of the shower, it is on the small side. But everything else makes up for that without question. I will definitely stay again next time I'm in town. Thank you, Mike."

With the trees outside the second floor windows, it really is like waking up in a treehouse :) The space inside is beautifully decorated - it’s a treat to spend time in a place so well-put together (colors, artwork, fabrics, personal touches.) The music decor theme is definitely well-done. And all the basics check too: comfortable bed √, great shower water pressure √, outfitted mini-kitchen √.
Ogden is a nice community, close to mountain trails and sunset views. A quick drive brought me to a trail access point where I watched the sun set over the mountains, but you can just as easily watch the evening show from the front door of the airbnb! I was there for an overnight, but can easily see spending a few days in the area to take in everything - with SLC just about 35 minutes away.
Mike was great to talk with - very friendly and personable, and knowledgeable about the area. I highly recommend this stay!
Thanks again, Mike and Krista. I hope to be back soon :)"

Ben, the host, was proactive, responsive, kind, and provided an excellent sushi restaurant recommendation. Bristol Mansion is in a peaceful neighborhood, only a few minutes drive from downtown and Ogden areas. Both the main entrance lock and individual apartment lock provided strong security.

Stayed a few nights","We greatly appreciated spending several restorative days at Bristol Manor. Elegant, but comfortable, period-appointed furnishings graced the home. An upper floor private mountain balcony seating area further showcased the natural beauty and enhanced the livability of this property. Our gracious host Ben provided a bit of local history and ongoing renovation details which added even more to our satisfying stay. An exceptional experience from start to finish!"

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at the Bristol Mansion was nothing short of perfect. Ben was extremely responsive (literally within seconds), very helpful with local recommendations (food, hiking, events) and any requests we made were fully accommodated, quickly.
Besides that, this building should be on a postcard for Ogden. Clearly a pet project for the owners to restore it and they have left no stone unturned in doing so and making it a premier accomodation for the area.
If you’re staying in Ogden, look no further, this is it!"

Stayed one night","What a great place! From the beautiful building to the wonderful architectural and design details like brass mailboxes, exposed brick in the bathroom and the massive grand staircase - the Bristol Mansion is a great find. The best way to describe the place is like a grand, historic mansion meets tasteful, classy and comfortable style.
We got a chance to meet the host Ben and his beautiful, friendly family. They took the time to answer all our questions and also shared their story of remodeling the mansion. These are some of the nicest people we’ve ever met!
100/10 would definitely stay here again and can’t wait to visit the Ogden area again so we can!"

Stayed one night","This place is unreal beautiful, reminds me of the historic restored apartments in New York City. Easy contactless check-in, the unit was quiet, clean, and had everything I needed. The bed was so comfortable and i loved having my morning coffee on the balcony with views of the mountains. Quiet neighborhood, great central location. No complaints!
I jokingly asked the hosts if i could move in. I will stay again if I'm ever back in Ogden!"

Stayed one night","Our stay was absolutely amazing and unforgetable. Looks like the owners have just renovated the space, and it was clear they had good taste, and thought out carefully what was great for their guests. The panoramic views of Mt Ogden from the beautiful balcony were just breathtaking. The suite was luxurious and we had a really good rest during that time. Location was also ideal with easy access to local attractions.
The team provided exceptional service and truly communicated promptly to ensure all our questions were answered. Their professionalism and warm hospitality made us feel so welcomed in their beautiful home. We can't wait to be back again. Thank you so much for this amazing stay. If you do get a chance to stay here, you should definitely grab it."

Stayed a few nights",Julie was a fantastic host! Very responsive and kind. She made us breakfast and was available to meet our needs all day for the duration of the stay. Non-intrusive and very private for being a basement rental. Couldn’t recommend her place enough!
