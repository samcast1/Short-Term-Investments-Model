Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed at the Depot for our anniversary. The cabin was clean, cozy and very private! We wanted something secluded in the middle of the woods and this was perfect! The hosts even had the fire pit set up and ready for us to light. We enjoyed walking the property. The trails are gorgeous! There are a lot of fun outdoor activities very close, with DeGray Lake just a few minutes away. We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights",The Rock Depot is quite the quaint little private getaway. It has everything you need. The only “issue” would be the micro fridge if staying for an extended period of time and you are the type to buy groceries and cook for yourself a lot.

Stayed a few nights","As my 5th time staying at the cabin, it's beginning to feel like a home away from home. Being from a city, the peace and quiet here is just what I need. Not only is it clean and private, Deborah and John make it special with their artwork and other distinct touches throughout the property, not to mention their thoughtful hospitality. In the mornings, take some coffee up the trail under the pines for some fresh air and a view from the bench up the path. Visit Rosalita and any of their other fur family who happen to be around. Every time I come, I find a new surprise--a sanctuary in progress. Truly a treat to stay here."

Stayed one night","Wow! This tiny home and its hosts are exceptional. It is a labor of love for them and you can tell they enjoy it. The house is in its own little clearing in a forest of pines. It is well appointed and cared for. My one regret was not being able to stay to meet the hosts, as I had a tight schedule. But I did take a walk using the trail map they left, and was astounded that the quarry was so beautiful in the morning light, with the sun gleaming on the water. Surprises like sculptures awaited me on my walk in the woods. This would be a great place for a writer to hole up for a little while. I bought John's book so I could learn more about Arkansas. I am grateful for my stay at the lovely little home, with clean linens, where I had a good night's sleep."

Stayed a few nights","This cute little cottage of Rock Depot has everything that's needed. Deborah has been an amazing super host and this bnb has everything that is needed - it definitely exceeded our expectations.
From amazing views through the windows to starry nights; we loved everything about this place.
There is a lake near by for fishing and to pass time by and some beautiful trails to walk through - or you could just do nothing and relax and rejuvenate at this place.
Woods,
Campfire,
Walks,
BBQ are the highlights.
Overall extremely satisfied with our stay and would definitely back in the fall!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my fourth time staying at Rock Hole Depot and it always feels like home. Deborah and John--the BEST hosts--put a lot of thought into special touches, from seasonal vines or wildflowers on the table, to the art of the cabin itself. My favorite ritual is making breakfast, then heading up the trail for a morning walk in the fresh air and maybe to scratch a donkey on her forehead. If you like nature and a little seclusion, this is your place, a true sanctuary."

It's comfortable, clean, beautiful, quiet, and hosted by amazing people. Deborah and John make it special by leaving maps of the surrounding area and even a scavenger hunt quiz to set you on your way! To start the day, I love breakfast at the picnic table and a walk up the pine-needled path to the quarry. Wild flowers on the table, homemade signs on the trails, rescue animals at the barn!, a stone circle!, Timon!, Miss Goldie!, Art! are all part of the paradise."

A unique stay with lots of special touches. There is a Roku TV, but you’ll need to have a Wi-Fi hotspot or download some stuff to your phone (to cast) to use it. I would stay here again if I was in the area!"

Stayed one night","We loved everything about the Rock Hole Depot. It was clean and we felt very comfortable and safe. Deborah and John did an amazing job rebuilding this depot and providing everything you need to enjoy your stay. We loved all the little details provided; photo album of the depot and rebuild, maps of the property and surrounding area, snacks and an ivy sprig to take with us. We enjoyed our evening walk around the property to see the quarry/lake and ducks. We will definitely return if we are in the area again."

Stayed a few nights","I truly cannot say enough good things about my stay at Deborah's little slice of heaven. From the minute I arrived, I was instantly impressed. Tucked away on a secluded patch of land a few minutes from Degray Lake, Deborah truly went above and beyond to make me feel at home. From the sprig of ivy from her own home (that she encouraged me to take!), to the fresh water in the fridge, to the maps outlining where all of the walking trails were; it really was a stay that exceeded my expectations.
I was in town for work, and had LONG meetings during the day, and it was so relaxing to come back to the depot, go for a short walk, read a book in the fresh air, and fall into a deep sleep in her comfortable bed. If you are needing an escape from the hustle and bustle of every day life, you should 100% book a few days at the depot. You will feel like a new person. Refreshed and ready to rock and roll. I truly cannot say enough good things about my stay, but I can say this, I will be back! :)"

Yet private !! it is just off John & Deborah's own private Lake . A must see ! . We came through the area to shop and dine mostly in Hot Springs... Upon arrival , we quickly decided that we would spend as much time at The Rock Hole Depot as we could .We explored the well kept walking trails just on each side of the cottage. The landscape is absolutely awesome !! When we returned we decided that we would get food to go and enjoy our meal at the picnic bench, near a fire where the wood had already been placed for us. Just had to light it up ....enjoy our surroundings, the beautiful weather , and the meal ! Ten out of Ten experience. They are truly the nicest people . They have created such a special place. Wonderful experience . We plan to return ASAP!!!"

Stayed one night","I drove to the small cabin, and exhaled a sigh of relief from the stress of yesterday. I felt like as soon as I walked in, I was able to have stillness and better thoughts than what I arrived with.
Deborah creates a space of love and peace, with attention to detail. This is a small lovely cabin that's perfect to relax in our outside in nature, of all the space you get to explore in peace.
Take a bath with her what looks brand new and sparkling tub and its customized sliding door. The dimmer in the main space is ideal for winding down, with a rocker chair and some hot tea and a book (which she supplies).
If you need to wash your clothes, a quiet washer and dryer will do the trick. She even has little things like q-tips, a toothbrush, toothpaste, ingredients to make cookies, a full keurig set. It doesn't have WiFi and I loved that. I did need to do one quick online task, and the hotspot did the trick. No distractions on social media too--perfect.
Take 2 nights if you can."

Stayed about a week","This is a perfect place for nature-lovers and artists alike. Deborah and John have created a property that reminds me of a quilt, where meaningful pieces are woven together. The cabin is cozy, clean, and unique. (When you stay, you MUST look through the album of photos illustrating its renovation). They have truly created an oasis among the pine trees, old quarry lakes, and a small barn with a pasture for two horses. If you're lucky you might also meet other rescue animals and their security pup, Timone!
Eat breakfast at the picnic table and take a walk through the woods for a great start to your day. And to top off your experience, visit their art studios where you'll ""get"" how this project began and continues to grow. Soon they will start an apiary!
From me to you, sleep well and let the peace soak in. I didn't want to leave."

The Depot itself is charming with unique and thoughtful furnishings. There is a mini-fridge and stove if you wish to cook (which we did). There is also an outdoor fire-pit and and BBQ grill. The place is clean. It is comfortable for two people.
Deborah leaves very detailed information about the walks you can take on their property: you can see the turquoise blue quarry water, their horse stables, and their small lake (just to name a few fun things to see).
You can walk to the state park from the Depot (or drive there in 5 minutes). The State Park has great hiking trails and a nice lake.
Deborah and John invited us to hang out with them at the horse barn, were we met the horses, cats, and dog. It was like being with family.
If you are looking for a quiet, tranquil, peaceful place, close to local hiking and a lake, this is the place you. We hope to return again."

Deb was kind enough to stay on the phone as she directed us to the cabin after we had gotten turned around in the dark. In the morning we walked around the ranch and met John. All we can say is wow! What an amazing couple! They are talented kind and very hospitable. We loved the story about the depot and it’s transformation.
We can’t wait to go back!
Ps. Those pillows are amazing!"

Stayed one night","**BREATHTAKING VIEWS - AMAZING HOSTS – PERFECT PRIVATE CABIN** Deborah and John were such amazing hosts! We picked this place at random on the way back to Texas from Tennessee. We were actually going to power through our drive and did not plan on stopping but we are so thankful that we did!! The depot was nice and warm when we got there, sparkling clean and there was even a fire set up for us ready to light right outside!! The night we stayed was right after a snow storm, so our truck actually got stuck in the ice on the way to the depot. Deborah and John answered their phones right away! They were so helpful and even offered to help get our truck unstuck in the morning! John rode down right away to make sure we were safe that night when we got in. We are so thankful for how kind they were to us but that’s not even the best part lol! It was dark when we arrived, so we didn’t get the chance to see the views. They have trails around the depot that are literally BREATHTAKING!! It is so GORGEOUS there. The trails are easy to get through- you could walk your grandma through them safely to get to these amazing views. AND they are both amazing artists (bring some extra cash so you can buy some of their stuff because you will want to lol)!! We definitely plan to come back to this place and are so happy to have met these two who are probably everyone’s relationship GOALS! I had to stop and ask John if he woke up so cool/awesome or if it came on gradually! Haha I wish we would have stayed longer!!"

We came across Rock Hole Depot and I was surprised that it was avaliable so I booked it right away. When we arrived there was a handwritten note, snacks and drinks in the fridge should we decide to take a hike around the property. There was even a fire prepped in the firepit ready to go. This was an amazing little getaway and we definitely be back."

Debrah and her husband went out of their way to dig out a path from the highway to the depot and then also a walking path around the property so we could stretch our legs have a romantic walk and a brief retreat. What a beautiful piece of property! We slept in and had a hearty breakfast before we got back on the road to Illinois. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and hope to come back soon.

Stayed one night","Our stay was far better than we even imagined! It was a one night stay on a road trip with my teenage daughter. When we arrived there was a handwritten note inviting us to join the hosts to feed the horses. We immediately started exploring the area. The depot is just that—a former miniature train depot. It is on a secluded lot with tons of wooded acreage around. Adjacent is the horse field where there is a large (not mini) train car converted into the feed barn. We were fortunate to show up right at feeding time and Deborah and John met up with us and shared their wonderful animals and stories with us. It was like meeting up with old friends! They were so gracious. My daughter got to brush Quincy the horse and we pet the cats and dog while chatting.
The experience continued after a great evening with a campfire and gorgeous view of the stars. Deborah had told us all about hikes in the area and there are maps in the depot. We decided to be adventurous and set out at dawn to hike to Lake DeGray. This was a beautiful walk.
We only were staying one night but I can see how this would be a great place to stay for several days to explore the area. We also took another suggestion from our hosts to visit Washington Arkansas on our drive out. Huge magnolia tree there and dozens of historical buildings. We would’ve never stopped there without her advice.
The Rock Depot lodging itself is absolutely perfect. Every amenity is present, beautifully clean, and lovely decor. This is a place where hospitality is #1! I was totally blown away by our stay and if you are planning a trip anywhere around this area-then stop now, this is the place! It’s easily worth the 40 min drive to Hot Springs rather than staying elsewhere or in a hotel. You won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed one night","The depot was a dream to stay in. It’s the perfect balance of everything you need on a retreat from daily life. Its close to the highway, but still feels private and secluded. It’s on six acres of land that is a short walk away from a great network of hiking trails and lake Degray. While the focus is on the outdoors, the inside of the cabin is outfitted with everything you need and artfully done. It was well stocked, clean, and recently renovated. There is a cute scrapbook of the history of the place and all the hard work that went into it. And as if all this doesn’t already make for a great time, the hosts were outstanding. They have seemingly thought of everything but were never intruding. My favorite touches were the stained glass windows, the walking canes to take on walks, and the ivy cutting that was left for us to take home. Overall very cool experience. Thanks for everything Deborah. I can’t wait to come back when we have more time!"

It is a ""our little secret"" kind of place, made so by the kindness and hospitality of Deborah and John. The newly remodeled cabin is perfectly appointed. Deborah goes above and beyond with cleaning and special touches - we arrived to snacks and the firepit already set up. Last, but not least, the natural surroundings are what set RHD cabin apart. You won't believe the beauty of the old quarry lake behind the cabin. Book this cabin, but make sure I can still rent it when I want too!"

It felt more like we were seeing family rather than staying in an Airbnb. When we arrived, Missy and Michael had a fire going in the fire pit and we got to hear some of their amazing stories. When they heard it was going to be my mom’s birthday, they did not hesitate to give her a bottle of Prosecco as a gift. The guesthouse is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, and they have thought of everything one might need during their stay here. There was lots of wildlife to watch, and the view of the Ouachita river is spectacular. We got to use their hot tub (words can’t express how fantastic it was) and their sweet cat Tilly came to visit us. I also used the jacuzzi bathtub and became a bath person. The best part of all is that my mom said she had a relaxing weekend free from stress and anxiety. I highly recommend!!"

The hot tub was really nice after a day of hiking around hot springs. We took the kayaks out too that was nice.

We grilled, played horseshoes, sat around the fire, roasted marshmallows, star gazed, & enjoyed the hot tub! There's nothing like enjoying your morning coffee or evening beer while in a hot tub 10 feet away from a river & beautiful scenery!

Stayed a few nights","Before I talk about the property, I want to say what amazing host these fine folks are! So kind, so thoughtful, so communicative, so proactive & the list just goes on & on!! Always concerned I was enjoying my stay! I can without a doubt state that this stay was was the most enjoyable stay I have ever had not only because of the stunning views but mainly because of these fabulous host!! Now, the property was terrific, serene & beautiful! Drinking morning coffee on the deck while watching the river flow, the hummingbirds come to the feeder, the deer enjoying corn in the front yard & just all of the beautiful nature that God created was simply breathtaking! I wish I had more time there to to enjoy it all but I can assure you that I will return! I have friends that are planning trips here based off of our conversations & pictures I sent to them. You will not be disappointed at the treehouse!! I can assure you of that!! Very highly, highly, highly recommended!!!"

Just those two made it worth the trip and that's not mentioning the resort style accomodations/ activities they provide. My 4 year old daughter hasn't stopped talking about the hot tub over looking the river, bubble bath in the Jacuzzi, fishing off the bank of the river, and "" her"" Crockett!!!! She was upset that we ran out of time to do any kayaking..:( We stayed for just the weekend ...and let me tell you... that is not enough time. Absolutely amazing!!!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","I was working in the area and needed a place to stay for a few days while my RV was repaired. This place wildly exceeded my expectations. It is close to town but somewhat off the beaten path. I was working from sun up to sun down so I did not get to enjoy the river or the hot tub, but the peaceful location and nicely appointed apartment made for an enjoyable stay. The hosts are great. They are friendly and attentive but not intrusive. If you need lodging in Arkadelphia this place should be your first choice....I think it would make for a nice romantic getaway that won't break the bank"

It was my mother's 60 birthday and this was my gift for her and when we arrived at the Treehouse, there was a beautiful birthday cake waiting for her when we arrived. That was the nicest hottub I had ever been in and the outside kitchen was awesome. We enjoyed every minute of it , oh and the bathroom in the tree house is to die for. Everything was well above any expectation. Honestly the Best Air B n B I've been to yet ! I will definitely be back , we are already checking dates to see when we can come back. You won't find a nicer host any where!!! Thank you so very much for making our time with you amazing 😍😍😍"

My family and I only had a one night stay, so we had to make the most of it, but the property is amazing! There is so much to do to keep your kids entertained and outdoors. I really enjoyed the lagoon next to the treehouse. Henry was very friendly and met us at the property to discuss the different sights located there and on our checkout day came and told us about some of the local sights we could catch on the way out. We definitely plan on a return visit with a longer stay next time."

We were able to actually relax on vacation, bird watch, read books, search for pirate ships, take paddle boat rides, operate a ferry, visit a fort, lay in the hammock and listen to the waterfall while watching wood peckers and cardinals. Absolute bliss."

He was quick to address small issues in the treehouse that we had not even noticed, and asked us repeatedly if we needed anything at all or if anything needed attention. The treehouse is MAGICAL. It is absolutely beautiful, set in the most incredible surroundings. We spent all morning exploring with our two boys, and they had the time of their lives. I can't recommend it enough! It is more expensive than a regular hotel, but I can tell you that this MADE our trip. It was absolutely worth the extra expense, and Henry could not have been a more welcoming and wonderful host. We can't wait to come back again!"

Our group of adventurous girls had a blast exploring the grounds, swimming in the lake, playing fetch with the pups, lounging in the hammocks, conquering fears of dark caves, rubbing the Buddha tummy, boarding a pirate ship, and hearing the constant calm of flowing water at night as we drifted to sleep in the treetops.
Inside, all the amenities you wouldn’t expect in the wilderness are here. That shower is everything! The nest up top was perfect for the kiddos and the private balcony perfect for reading. Oh and the sunset…can’t say enough good things about this place. Core memories for sure."

If you love being outdoors especially boys you will love this place. The treehouse itself was completely amazing. For you mommas who want to go but don’t want to play this is your place! You have everything you would want on a camping trip without the camper or tent! The activities were endless. We hiked, biked, kayaked, swam, explored… it was great fun. Henry was such a great host and we enjoyed our visit with him. The pictures DONT do this place justice. The freedom to explore was refreshing and the peaceful atmosphere was much needed. The talent and dream to bring this place to life is something that the Lord blessed this family with! Do it you won’t regret it!"

My children and I absolutely loved it at the Toucan Treehouse and we loved Mr. Henry! He is a very kind gentleman. We felt safe and protected our entire stay. The beds were comfortable and the house was cool. Everything we needed was there from kitchen utensils, cooking supplies, bathing, laundry, towels, pillows, extra blankets, games and books! Access to the movie channels was an added bonus. We loved having breakfast on the porch, relaxing on the hammocks, taking a boat ride on the lake, swimming in the beautiful pool, and of course exploring the hidden treasures on the property! Thank you, Henry, for opening your tropical jungle-like paradise up to the world and sharing this gem with us! We will definitely return for a much longer stay! Next time I hope it rains!"

None of us wanted to leave.

We fished and swam on the lake, we explored the pirate ships, we crossed the ferry, we climbed up to the Swiss family robinson treehouse, we climbed the ropes course, played on the log seesaw, and made s’mores by the fire! Not only are there tons of adventures to be had, but the treehouse is FULLY stocked with anything you may think of. If you are thinking about a family trip, DO NOT HESITATE!

Stayed one night",Staying at the Toucan Treehouse is like having a vacation resort all to yourself. It is an absolutely stunning piece of paradise. We enjoyed watching the sunset as our boys fished in the lake. They caught fish every few minutes and our oldest son caught a huge bass that was his all time biggest catch. The treehouse is extraordinary and we created memories that will last a lifetime. Henry is a wonderful host and we enjoyed our visit with him. He is funny and really welcomes you “home” with an overview of the property and makes sure that you are aware of the best places to explore. We are planning to come again and suggest that you stay at least two nights because there is just so much to see. Thank you Henry for taking such great care of us. Our treehouse adventure was such a dream come true.

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay, I wish it would have been a little cooler, the lake was warm, temps outside were 100’s degrees, I think we would have adventure out a little more, but the ac worked great! The two 14 year olds didn’t slow down though! Explored all the trails and fished a bunch, we all hiked to the summer camp near by. My 10 year old can’t wait to try that out next summer! He said, “know this is how a summer camp is supposed to look like!” Lol"

The treehouse has everything we needed! From the moment we arrived, my husband and I were amazed. The treehouse views are amazing. Henry, met us at the property to explain the ins and outs. Two days was not enough. My husband and I didnt venture out too much because the heat was unbearable, but there are hiking trails in every direction with cute signs telling you where to go. Most of my time was spent on the lake fishing!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the honeymoon dreams were made from! The treehouse and the land were magical!
My husband and I felt like we were in a fairytale the whole time, from the treehouse and beautiful waterfalls, to the canoeing through the canals, to the gorgeous swim hole, to the adventurous pirate ships, New Orleans square, and Teepee village, we couldn’t have asked for a more perfect honeymoon! Truly!!
We felt we traveled around the world without the work of airplane trips and taxi rides! We had it all and it wasn’t busy with tourists!
The precision to details along with the imagination placed into everything was wonderful!
The host was a gentleman, kind hearted, good humored, and full of information and stories! What a treat!
We can’t thank you enough! We honestly never wanted to leave! :)"

Our kids especially loved canoeing in the lagoon, swinging out over the lake, and climbing on board the pirate ships! What a great adventure!"

Our kids were looking forward to this place since we told them we were coming and it didn’t disappoint! The inside of the treehouse was even better than we expected! The shower had 3 separate showerheads and the air conditioning felt great after being outside all day! There was also plenty to see and do both nearby and on Henry’s property! The kids especially loved adventuring down the trails and seeing all the themed areas Henry created! Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the area!

Stayed one night","The Treehouse and grounds are such an amazing experience! My 8 year old and 3 year old haven't stopped talking about it since we left! We knew the 3 year old was a bit young for the property so we kept a very close eye on him with the water and bridges. My 8 year old was such a great age for this property! The grounds are the most unique, peaceful, and magical place we've stayed at. We hiked the grounds from the moment we arrived until the sun set, then again in the morning until we left the grounds. A must see for kids and adults that love to explore, love treehouses, and love pirates. We will most certainly be back! Also, the mountain biking in Arkadelphia and Hot Springs was fantastic as well so we did the Treehouse one night and on the prior day and following day we mountain biked and explored the city!"

We spent hours hiking the easy trails on the property and finding all of the highlights on the map. The treehouse is less than 10 minutes from the highway so it’s convenient to town as well.
Our favorites were the cave, trails, canoes, bridges, open space, fort, and of course the treehouse. The minute my kids saw a cargo lift to get their luggage up they felt like they were on an adventure. The water features were beautiful everywhere. We received rain and lightning while staying the night and it was a beautiful show. We were told there was a professionally installed lightning rod as well to protect us. Thanks Henry for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","The treehouse is well built; yes, if you watch outside markers through the windows you’ll see the treehouse does sway quite a bit. Which was a totally awesome feeling and experience, but never have we heard any buckling, crackling, or structural creaking the entire stay. Not even the floor creeks. Never felt any safety concern of any sort. The floor plan seemed symmetrical, was well thought out for all the comforts and amenities all the while spacious for a romantic couple or family trip. The interior decorating had eye catching items and views on the walls at every glance; while the nearly 180 degree view from the kitchen and clear view through the rest of the homes huge windows keeps your wonder both inside and out.
Fell in love with all the vegetation, especially bamboo throughout the grounds. The trails were clear, but I would suggest hiking boots. Enjoying everything this BnB has to offer is definitely worth at least a two nights stay. The host was very generous and flexible with the scheduled time of stay.
The WiFi and two TVs were in great working order. I loved the reclining master bedroom’s bed. However as a side sleeper I had a hard time sleeping the whole night because the bed or mattress has a bit of a dip where your tush is while you’re sleeping on your back.
The chairs in the general living area were pretty comfortable, sturdy, and easy to get out of.
We went in the winter so no matter of Arkansas big or tiny outside wildlife was an issue, however during the summer I think I’d wish for good bug lotion and screen doors. Was a bit too cold for a bonfire, but if ever we go back it’ll most likely be in the late end of autumn to definitely include that experience too."

Stayed with kids","Stop Looking and get Booking!!!!
Our greatest complaint is not having more time! We traveled with our three sons (14,12,9) for two nights. I don't know if you could dream up a more idealist place to stay. They didn't want to leave. Pictures can't capture how lovely the Treehouse is. There is literally days of things to explore. Every small detail is wrapped in love and intentional planning. Henry is in a Master Class level of hosts. Such a wonderful person.
Beds and linens are high quality and comfortable. The large bathroom is nicer than most 5 star resort/hotels I've stayed at. Kitchen is modern and has anything you could possibly need, plus more. There are two twin beds upstairs in the loft with a very nice air mattress that we actually put into the side closet/storage area. It was like its own special bunkroom! Massive.
We travel and stay at dozens of Air bnbs and I must say, this has been our most favorite experience in the US. If you have adventurous children, this is the dream. We watched swiss family Robinson the night before we got here and surprised our kids.
We WILL return, many times."

It's hard to snap pictures that give due praise to this amazing property. We arrived later than expected, and Henry and his dog were waiting for us. After a warm welcome, we quickly fell asleep listening to the water and wind going through the bamboo. In the morning after breakfast, we explored the grounds and realized we need much more time to discover all the finds on the treasure map. We hope to see you again soon, Henry. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Where do I begin?! You see the pictures and think its an awesome place, then as soon as you drive up and go into the treehouse you are even more amazed!! Everything is laid out perfectly! Small enough to be a treehouse, but roomy like you are not. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. Full sized refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, & microwave. Buy groceries and cook your food in the treehouse. You will want to spend much time high amongst the trees and listening to the peaceful waterfall down below. We ate several meals out on the lovely porch off the living room. Our 2 kids LOVED the loft bedroom which was perfect! My husband and I enjoyed the wonderful view to wake up to every morning from the master bedroom. Plenty of fluffy towels & linens were provided along with extra blankets, pillows, etc... The lake down from the treehouse is a haven for relaxing and having fun! The kids (and us adults too) enjoyed swinging on the swing out over the lake, as well as lounging in the hammocks, fishing and paddling the boat out. There was a wonderful breeze constantly blowing while at the lake which was so nice! You absolutely MUST walk all of the fantastic nature trails! We LOVED all the swinging bridges and hidden gems that Henry has built over the years! Walk the trails, slow down, take pictures, enjoy nature! UN-PLUG! RELAX! Henry was a treat as a host. He was so friendly, easy to communicate with, helpful, and accommodating! Thank you so very much Henry for sharing your wonderful, whimsical treehouse and grounds with us! It was a perfect family vacation get away that we needed! We even extended our stay another night once we got there we loved it so much! There are exactly 57 steps to the top so eat your wheaties before you go! HA! One thing to note which was absolutely not a problem for us, but the treehouse does ever so gently sway a tad. If anyone in your party has Extreme motion sickness it could possibly bother them? I personally have some motion sickness issues, but it did not bother me. I would recommend bringing groceries, stopping by Walmart to pickup cold groceries on the way in and cooking your meals at the treehouse. After all, isn't this fabulous treehouse WHY you came? To stay in it and have such a neat experience?! SO..... spend time ""in"" the treehouse! They have a grill and charcoal so we grilled out steaks one night! There is a firepit and wood so bring some marshmallows to roast! Also, I highly recommend hanging out in the hammocks downstairs by the waterfall. I took a 2 hour nap there that was wonderful and healing to the soul! We took 1 day and drove to the diamond mine to look for treasures. If you are staying several days I would recommend this, but if only for a few days then skip it and enjoy staying put! We planned our trip for over a year and we are SO glad to finally be able to book it and go! We will definitely be back! WONDERFUL FAMILY MEMORIES WERE MADE AT TOUCAN TREEHOUSE!!! Thanks again Henry and GOD BLESS!!!"

He was attentive and a very easy Host to communicate with. prompt, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Lots to do around the area such as mining for crystals, visiting Hot Springs and the Diamond crater mine. All about an hour in either direction.

This is more than just a treehouse to stay at but the entire property has many things to enjoy that makes the experience well worth it. This properly felt like we were transported somewhere in the Amazon forest and it truly it incredible. There are canoes, many hikes, pirate ships, lots of bamboo and exploring to do. You don’t need to leave the property at all during your stay and there’s lots to enjoy. I’d recommend a stay for at least two days to fully enjoy it. Loved the location because even though it was remote it was still close enough to groceries and lots of places to eat, which made it very easy after a long day of exploring. We really enjoyed our stay in the toucan treehouse and may even decide to go back someday. Highly recommend! 5/5!!"

Stayed with kids","This treehouse is like nothing you can imagine! It is truly an adventure waiting for you. It is situated on 220 acres of beautiful piney woods with trails and lakes and surprises around every corner. Henry, the host of the treehouse, has built a wonderland of adventure with so many bridges over a slow-moving system of canals, pirate caves, waterfalls, tikis, and on and on. It was a magical stay for our family. We left yesterday and our two daughters are already asking when we can go back."

Stayed a few nights","Our family of four made a weekend trip to the Toucan Treehouse this past weekend and enjoyed every minute of it. The treehouse itself is adorable, the pictures don’t do it justice. The shower was a huge attraction for all of us, what luxury while up in the treetops! We were very fortunate to have perfect fall weather and we walked all over the entire property. There is something new to marvel at each turn. Henry and Veda (and their cute furry herd) were fantastic hosts. Lifetime of memories made—definitely recommend!!"

The treehouse was very comfortable - not an amenity was missing - fully functional kitchen, spacious bathroom, comfortable beds and very clean. The entire treehouse, inside and out is very creative and a design masterpiece. Definitely one of a kind! We loved it!"

Stayed with kids","Book Now! It is worth every penny and more. The accommodations are incredible and the scenery is unmatched. We had a full day to explore and know that we still didn't see it all. We would absolutely go back again and plan to next year. Henry is one of the best hosts I have experienced with airbnb and it was evident he loves being a host and sharing paradise with those who visit. As a parent, I have not felt like such a kid in 20 years and I have never heard so much laughter from our family. Truly a one of a kind experience, its like your own personal Jumanji...without all the scary parts! Although the stay is private and secluded, you are also 10 min to a Walmart. The AC works very well and the shower is FANTASTIC! Overall, it is hands down our favorite airbnb experience."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for magic, you will find it here. We filled every minute of our three night stay with adventure: fishing in our private pond, hiking miles of beautifully maintained trails, letting our imaginations run wild while eating dinner on our balcony (next to our waterfall) in the treetops and roasting s’mores over a campfire. The home was immaculately clean and well stocked. The kids loved scheming in their own private loft. We brought crystals, gold doubloons, fools gold and arrowheads to hide and find during our adventures around the property.
Camp was in session while we were there, but we still felt as if the whole place was to ourselves. When we did run into campers, the campers and counselors were gracious and helpful (and inspired my 8 year old to consider camp next year). We were on the tail end of our 2 week trip through Arkansas, and Henry generously offered a swim in his own private pool. It doesn’t get any better than that.
It’s abundantly clear that Henry has built this slice of heaven to inspire creativity and calm. It’s been a labor of love, and he has well surpassed that mark!"

Endless opportunities to explore the trails and find the many treasures including the tepees, pirate ships, etc. Walking through the bamboo lined trails is magical. We enjoyed walking over the many bridges, kayaking the lagoon, and swimming at the lake. Life jackets, kayaks, beach chairs are all provided. The Treehouse is equipped with everything you need inside as well. We enjoyed meal time on the balcony and watching the birds. Quiet time in the hammocks was peaceful. We loved our visits from the doodles. Our dogs also enjoyed the freedom to explore and play. Our time was magical and memorable and we definitely will be back. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","By far one of the best experiences we have ever had, it far exceeded anything we could have expected and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a little getaway! It is like a little slice of paradise that you get to have all to yourself. The treehouse itself is awesome and getting to stay in it is a unique experience that you won’t regret! Mr. Henry is an excellent host, he is very friendly and has thought of every little detail to make your trip absolutely perfect! The adventures alone are priceless. Take one of the numerous trails and not only experience the beauty of nature, but they also lead to fun areas to explore. We played on pirate ships, pretended to be soldiers protecting the gold at Fort Crown Point, went on a treasure hunt and found some in Blackbeard’s cave, and even discovered arrow heads at the Native American village (I planned ahead and brought pirate treasure for the cave, arrowheads for the village, and chocolate gold coins for the fort). We made s’mores over a campfire, and although we didn’t get a chance to utilize all the water activities, there are boats, kayaks, and canoes available for you to use (life jackets are even provided), there are plenty of fishing spots, a small sandy beach with swimming area right behind the treehouse, and if you take the short hike to the other swimming area, there is an obstacle course area (over the water) with ropes and swings and a big inflatable blob. There is so much to do (more than I can list here) you don’t need to leave the site to find entertainment. Everything you need is provided, except bug spray-which it’s in the woods, so you’ll need some and food (sugar, salt, pepper, oil, condiments, coffee, laundry and dish detergent, shampoo and conditioner, soap, and other basics are there for your use). We plan to make this a yearly trip."

Stayed a few nights","Toucan Treehouse is such a unique and amazing experience! I say experience because it is so much more than just a place to stay. The treehouse was perfect for a family of four. My boys are adults and still fit comfortably in the loft upstairs. The place had everything we needed to stay comfortably. The views of the lake from the treehouse were beautiful, especially from sunset. All of the trails, lakes, lagoons, and activities kept us so busy! We were like little kids going on an adventure. Henry and Austin were super friendly, accommodating and helpful. It’s very secluded but also close to Caddo Valley so you can grab supplies and gas. DeGray Lake is just minutes down the road and is a great place to visit on your trip. We will be back!"

This place truly makes you feel like a kid again and if you have kids or fur babies it’s an absolute paradise! The trails were phenomenal, if you don’t get turned around like we did. Make sure you take your walking/hiking shoes. The landscape and property is simply breathtaking! This is truly a one of a kind experience that is worth every penny although I was reluctant to stay at first because of the price but once the owner assured me that it would be worth it, I knew we had struck gold the first day when we arrived. Forever in my memories and we will be be back hopefully sooner than later for round 2!!!"

Stayed one night","We had such a wonderful with our family on a much needed getaway. We appreciate your hospitality, Henry. You and your family have such an amazing place! The property grounds can not be fully described in words or pictures, you must just see it ALL! Absolutely amazing. You will be wowed from the very beginning of driving down the driveway! The attention to detail in not only the treehouse but the entire property is like nothing I have ever seen before. You feel like you are on an island some place tropical mixed with the very best of Arkansas natural setting. Our family stayed the night January with temps in the 50's. Our 2 boys who are 10 and 12 just loved it all. We hiked all over. We felt like we went on an amazing adventure discovering new areas of the property that Henry and his family put so much thought into developing. The treehouse itself sits in a private setting overlooking a private lake. The treehouse was very comfortable! The shower was delightful! Great space under the treehouse for relaxing! The attention to detail was shocking and much appreciated! We love taking road trips as a family and this place made the very top of our list of favorite stays! Henry was so kind to our family. You couldn't ask for a better host! Thanks again for everything, Henry! If you are reading this considering visiting, I say DO IT and make sure you go exploring the property!!"

The river is quite a drop down from the cabin. Which we couldn’t tell from listing photos. Several steep metal stairs to get to the bottom to fish or explore. Other than that the pictures portray the property very well. Would recommend to friends and family for a great cabin stay.

Group trip","I cannot say enough good things about our stay! The location is perfect, literally ON the River, fantastic views from inside the house and the porch and bedroom. Peaceful setting immersed in nature feels so private. Internet was great and strong - boys even played Xbox streaming and had no issues! We brought our Apple TV with us which worked great!
There is a volleyball/badminton net, cornhole and a fire pit riverside which looked amazing but it rained most of the weekend so we didn’t get to use but would love to if we return!
House stays a little smoky from the amazing fireplace but it didn’t bother us! The screened in back porch is incredible and private and has a super cute daybed that my girls loved!
Walmart is an easy 12 min drive into town, and Dollar General is even closer in a pinch. Hot springs is about 30-40 min depending on where you are heading. Highly recommend Garvan Woodland Gardens year round - if you go during late Nov/Dec they will likely have the Holiday Lights going 4-9pm - get tickets ahead of time they sell out but HIGHLY worth it. Also hike at Lake Catherine - gorgeous spot!
We loved our morning coffee ritual on the porch overlooking the River, and the rustic cabin vibe was perfect. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

I if can’t buy it, I will be back to visit many times! I would say the cleaning fee is a bit much. It was over $200 for the cleaning fee and it is asked and expected to leave the house spotless. Which I did. But I would stay more often if the price didn’t almost double for the stay due to that high fee."

It had all the amenities we could ask for and more (horse shoe pit, tetherball pole, darts, pool table, cards, puzzles, board games, bubbles for the kids, a pit boss smoker for the adultier kids). It had more than enough sleeping space for everyone and had enough space and seating that we could have invited our whole extended family out to relax and visit for a while.
My kids loved the nature surrounding the cabin. They watched fireflies from the porches, counted stars from the deck overlooking the river, and we even got to watch a red fox come up from the river and meander back into the woods.
We definitely look forward to booking this cabin again in the future.
**My only word of caution for future renters is something that I had to remind my children several times. We're in a cabin out in the woods, overlooking a beautiful river. There will be bugs. We had several dirt daubers make it into the cabin, saw a couple of spiders, and had some moths and flying insects that would surround our bedside lamps at night. This was not a problem for us, because it's to be expected in a setting like this. I just wanted to include the caution in the event some people just really don't like bugs."

Stayed with kids","Pictures do not do this place justice! Cabin is spectacular and the views are breathtaking. Location is wonderful. Just a few miles outside of nearest town and has a quiet, remote feel. Our kids loved the “secret playroom” upstairs! The water located just outside the cabin is accessible, but not really good for wading/playing. Found a few fishhooks and the sand is like sinking sand! We also got bit by lots of chiggers, but all in all a very small price to pay for the fun we had! We will definitely be coming back!"

Stayed with kids","I have been renting condos for many years, there are some that are just diamonds and this is one. We were in town visiting my student athlete and this is the perfect home for that. We were able to walk to the OBU pool, the football stadium is even closer. If you're visiting a Henderson student it is an even closer walk to their stadium, tennis courts , and pool. For me it was amazing to be .25 miles or less from Feaster Trail, a gorgeous walking/running trail that goes through Arkadelphia.
The home itself is just gorgeous and perfectly appointed, everything is in the kitchen that we needed and the table was perfect for the family dinner we had. The towels in the bathrooms are the softest I've felt in an ABnB and the beds were super comfy too. My son is a freshman and we will definitely be staying here again!"

The bathrooms were beautiful and we loved the mirror that lit up when you touched it! The towels were comfy and soft. There was a well stocked kitchen to fit all of your needs. Our kids loved that there was a TV in every room as we won’t allow them to have a TV in their rooms at home so they thought this was pretty neat! The location was the perfect distance between Hot Springs and the Crater of Diamonds which is what we were looking for. The house was in a neighborhood that is not quite what we were anticipating as far as walking around, but I believe that it looks like it is up and coming! We definitely recommend it!"

Stayed one night","Joy & Richard were wonderful start to finish! Padre’s House was easy to get to, convenient to OBU’s campus & a very inviting space. We felt completely at home. Although it only sleeps 4, there are 3 spaces that groups could use if you were meeting up with friends or family. My mom & I enjoyed the homemade cinnamon rolls & they also provided some eggs, milk, soy milk & orange juice.
After we packed & were ready to leave the car wouldn’t start. Richard came over from next door, took out the battery & drove us to Autozone to have it tested. We had to have a new one & he put it in for us as well. Way above & beyond!
In the midst of this we had a chance to visit with them both & learned that Joy was @ OBU with my aunt & they were in the same major.
My daughter has 2 years left at OBU & we look forward to the opportunity for another stay at Padre’s House!"

Joy and Richard have created a space that makes you feel right at home, with every small detail executed with warmth, intention, and care. We were traveling with our 15 month old, and Joy asked ahead of time if we’d like their pack n play set up for us. Absolutely! One less item to haul in - so kind. She even set out blocks and other toys to play with, along with kiddo shampoo. We couldn’t wait to get into the homemade cinnamon rolls until morning, so we had them for a late night snack after our little one went down. The house has been thoughtfully remodeled in parts while still preserving the beautifully aged and nostalgic parts. It’s extremely clean, tidy, and welcoming - love the fresh flowers. Joy left us local recommendations written on a beautiful card and was proactive and very helpful via the app. I really could go on and on. This stop was perfect on our way to the Smokies."

Stayed with a pet","I'm so happy I found Padre's! This place was one of the most comfortable AirBnBs I've stayed in. The hosts clearly care a lot about their guests and have set up thoughtful amenities like nightlights, extra kitchen equipment, food, milk options for breakfast, and supplies, etc. Very easy to find from the interstate, but quiet and in a safe neighborhood. The furniture is high quality and it feels like a real home. I will absolutely stay here again when passing through Arkadelphia, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone!"

Stayed with a pet","I cannot say enough good things about staying at Joy & Richard's place. Not only was it super easy to find, the neighborhood was serene and the house was both easy to access and filled with so many little things you wouldn't even know to ask for. They asked if I'd prefer vegan options and left me with orange juice, almond milk and vegan English muffins. There was popcorn, oatmeal, many different coffees, eggs and all sorts of other unexpected amenities. Both Joy and Richard responded almost instantly when I needed info and they were warm and welcoming of both me and my nervous dog. I couldn't imagine anyone not loving their stay here. And the bed was so comfortable! FIVE STARS!"

Stayed a few nights","Padre's House is by far the best Airbnb I've stayed at. Its super clean, bed are comfortable, they continually update/change things in the house to make it so inviting to stay that you don't want to leave. They recently added a very comfortable recliner in the living room causing me to sit, relax and read books they had on their bookshelf (a rare moment as I'm usually on the go). Richard and Joy always goes above and beyond to provide a home away from home to all their guests. A few things that make our stay special are: Joy's cinnamon rolls are so delicious, freshly picked flowers brighten up the rooms (and kitchen) and they have all the ingredients/kitchen tools I might need if I forget to bring something. The location is close to I-30 which makes it easy to get to. If you're in the area looking for a place to stay, Padre's House is the place to go."

We had the opportunity to visit with Joy and Richard, they are such lovely people! Makes your stay much more comfortable and welcoming! Padres House was such a peaceful, cozy, nostalgic home, that transported us back in time to my grandmothers house! Joy makes sure your stay is special with homemade baked cinnamon rolls. Upon arrival and special personalize touches throughout the house, We had beautiful fresh cut flowers in every room!! There’s such a wonderful story throughout the house and several books that talk about the treasures, and how long they traveled through history to get where they are! It was such a clean, cozy home, with all the amenities you could ask for! I could go on and on! If we ever find ourselves back in Arkadelphia, this will be our stay always!!! Highly recommend!!!"

We were sad we were only passing through and didn’t have more time to enjoy the yard, back porch, and other amenities, as this would be a perfect spot to relax and unwind. This will be our new go-to spot when driving from Texas to Kentucky to visit family. We look forward to staying again in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","This was our first stay at Padre's House. The location is great relative to just about anywhere in Arkadelphia, with easy access to the main roads and highway to get to wherever you need to go. The house itself is amazing. Very quaint and inviting. We loved the backyard ambiance, decorations, and privacy. We had some really nice weather, so we were able to sit out back with our dog on several occasions. He's pretty chill, so even without a fence the space is laid out well enough where he wasn't going anywhere. The history picture book in the sunroom area was an interesting read, with relevant sections highlighted by the hosts to provide context. I enjoy reading about an area's local history, so that was a nice find. Joy and Richard were excellent hosts. They provided all the needed info before we got there and the check-in process was simple and straightforward. Bonus points for the cinnamon rolls! Overall, we loved Padre's House and would stay there again at the next opportunity."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Joy and Richard's was cozy! The sunroom was a nice place to have morning coffee and homemade cinnamon rolls from Joy. :) Enjoyed all the many plants around, as well as the fish tank. Didn't get a chance to sign and leave a note for the guestbook wall, but enjoyed reading a few! Do be aware that this is an older home and as such, floors and doors might be a bit creaky. We really appreciated the ability to bring pets, as we were moving cross country and had our 2 cats in their crates. This was so much more affordable than the additional fees for pets at hotels! The value for this stay was great, and being just a few hours from our new home, I'm already hoping to plan another stay here in the future with my sister for a night or two. Next time I'm going to spend a bit more time outside. :) If you get a chance to meet Joy/Richard and hear the story about Padre, take it!"

We especially loved the notes telling us about some of the decor and the books on the history and remodel of Padre’s House in the living room bookcase.

We not only love the convenience but enjoy visiting with Richard and Joy (they both a such a sweet couple who live Padre's House). They're very responsive to any questions or issues I've had and helpful in making food recommendations. Also, I am a very clean and picky person and Joy is the same; the house and yard is very well kept and super clean! If you're looking for a place to stay, this it it!

I got to make my own drip coffee which for some reason is rare while traveling due to the awful k-cup movement. :) The beds were super comfy. I can't say enough, other than, Joy can we live there?!

Joy and Richard are very hospitable hosts and communicate well.
Location is ideal for anyone traveling through Arkansas to/fromTexas and to/from points east, and I imagine for anyone wanting to explore the Hot Springs area but still be away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy parts.
The neighborhood appears safe and well-kept.
The bedrooms are slightly on the smaller side, especially compared to the other rooms in the house. However, they didn't pose any problems.
We all (including our dog) loved the sunroom! Great place to watch the birds and squirrels in the backyard.
We appreciated all the personal touches from the homemade sweet rolls to a fresh rose in each bedroom from the yard.

It was about 30 minutes away from Hot Springs, which was perfect for us, who like to be in more relaxing and peaceful surroundings. The property is well taken care of and had everything we needed. We enjoyed our view of the pond and playing checkers while watching the geese and even a couple of deer pass by. Overall wonderful stay!"

Also, visited with life long friends who relocated to Bismarck in 2016. Katie was available and ready to help with all our needs.
We appreciate you and pray that your houses do well for you.
Thanks again,

The house is so centrally located to everything we wanted to do and Katie is a great host. She was quick to answer our questions and was available but not intrusive. The house was spotless, furnishings are comfy, and the house layout allows privacy for a whole family. The kitchen has everything you’ll need and the bath/showers are so nice. Lots of little extras to make for the perfect stay."

Kitchen very well stocked (no whisk but fork does fine). Extra mattress was helpful as 1 bed a little small for 2 adults (unless a couple)...lol. We enjoyed the flying burger recommendation as well!

Stayed a few nights","This house appears to have been recently renovated and is nicely decorated. It was spotlessly clean and well cared for. It's pretty spacious, so if four people stayed there, they'd not be bumping into each other. The kitchen seems to have all the basics for cooking, and again, was very clean. There's a coffeepot, and great quality coffee and filters were provided. There's a desk in one of the bedrooms, if you have work to do or want to use it for your laptop. The lighting is good for working at the kitchen table, too.
The view from the back porch/deck is a solid wooded area and is very peaceful. There's a carport, which will be nice for those who stay in the summer to leave their car in the shade. The host responded quickly to messages.
We have family in Arkadelphia, and hope to stay here in the future when we're visiting. It'll be our home away from home. :)"

The place was exactly as listed, and very much gave me the feeling of being at home.
The back covered porch area was a nice place to sit and relax and unwind from the day and not be bothered by anything else around.
Brenda’s place had all the basics covered plus a couple extras, I could not have ask for a better, more accommodating place to make me feel at home during my time in the area..,
