Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay that provided easy access to the Nickle Plate and Pan Handle bike trails. Misty and Mark were most accommodating and the studio guest quarters were extremely comfortable. They have upgraded the seating from the gray couch to Lazy-Boy love seat recliners! Likely the cleanest Air B&B we have experienced. No steps and the curb less shower is much appreciated for us seniors. It was a little challenging finding the correct drive but there address number is on the mailbox and when you look for the white finish it is very obvious.

Only issue was it seemed like the shower wasn’t able to drain properly and left a lot of water on the floor, making it slick."

Stayed a few nights","Spacious, pristine, simple, charming, and everything we needed for our getaway from it all stay! Misty replied to any questions almost immediately! Mattress was softer than we were used to, so we were surprised at how comfortable it actually was - and the bedding was so cozy! The pond and woods trails provided an entertaining variety of nature for curious nature buffs like me. A beautiful, serene place. I plan to bring my daughter and her girls here soon! Tip: the bathroom is done in an industrial theme. It has a concrete floor that gets slippery when wet. There are a couple of bath mats on the floor and nice-sized non-skid mats in the shower. Those with falling or balance issues might want to bring flip-flops or shower shoes for extra precaution. We usually camp in our camper when we travel but love this place so much, we'll likely make this an annual (at least) to come visit."

Stayed with a pet","Just came back from spending 3 nights there with my pup. It was one of my fav airbnbs so far. The place was super easy to find and I was impressed by how clean and simple everything was. I’m super picky about how clean a place feels when you first walk in and I had absolutely no issues, not a cob web in sight, and I didn’t feel like I had to keep all my bags off the floor lol. The mini kitchen was just enough for me to prepare the food I packed and the shower in the bathroom is amazing. I specifically was looking for a place that was lowkey, quiet, AND had access to a pond for fishing and this was perfect. I even caught my first 5 pound bass! The hosts were super welcoming and accommodating especially when it came to having my dog with me. I already told them I plan to come back."

Stayed one night","The most comfortable bed I may have ever slept on. Plenty of space, nice furnishings. I never saw the lake nor could figure out how to see it. Parking is right in front and private behind their home. It offers basic amenities (coffee but no cream or sugar sorta deal) and is safe and quiet in the country. They have large dogs on the property which didn't bother me at all, but if you don't like big dogs be forewarned. I recommend this space in rural Indiana."

Misty was extremely responsive, let us check in with 30 minutes notice, and it was a great choice for us. Far better than any hotel option within 50 miles. We were able to comfortably work from the place the next day and the kitchenette made dinner and breakfast easy. The weather prevented us from getting out and exploring the land, but it was peaceful and perfect for our overnight stay."

Stayed a few nights",It was a very clean and quiet stay. We would love to stay again for sure. A few issues we had were that the grill was not up kept and there was no charcoal or propane. We would have loved to grill. The rubber mattress cover would not stay on and made it very sweaty but the bed was comfy. With that being said we still love the little cottage and want to go back. We loved the quiet and the sounds of nature. The pictures online are exactly what we walked into. The hosts were there if we needed them which we did not and they gave us our privacy. It was very nice. ( a faster coffee pot would be a great addition) just a thought.

Stayed one night","The inside was clean and cute. The internet on the tv in the living room wouldn’t load Netflix. The outside was full off cobwebs. I had to clean them off the key box to access it. The mattress on the bed sinks to the middle. Paying a $75 cleaning fee I shouldn’t have to clean or clear anything. Only 1 small creamer for coffee and no sugar only artificial sweetener. No cleared path to the rivers edge. Lots of sm tree stumps in the yard and around the fire pit, we both tripped over. My boyfriend has a bad hip and knee, not a good mix. The cover over the grill was all torn and was not inviting to cook on. It actually had a wasp nest by the handle. There was supposed to be lighter fluid to start the firepit but there wasn’t any to be found. The cottage next door was overgrown and an eyesore, I understand they don’t have control over that but it was unpleasant to sit out back. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement for the money we spent."

Stayed one night","The stay at Marlenes was quiet, quaint, and serene! It wasn’t a far drive from northwestern Indiana at all. The exterior is a little antiquated and buggy (there were a few tiny night bugs to watch for when coming in and out the back porch) but the inside is beautifully enhanced and so cozy! The house is perfect for couples looking to relax and bond! We were able to take kayaks to the river right behind us for a short paddle by the house. They do have a longer a kayak option with much more beautiful views to see but we arrived a little later to try, we would love to be able to try that next time. The house is fully equipped with everything you needed for the stay. If you are in the area looking for a peaceful stay away from the busy life, this is the place!"

I loved that we got to make food over the fireplace like we were camping, but also get to go inside and make food on the stove and then have a cozy movie night. I loved the shower, it was really hot and had good pressure, and the bed is comfortable. We had a great time!"

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I had a really nice stay at this cabin over labor day weekend. Marlene was really helpful about planning a few lovely surprises for my partner. She created a lovely display of chocolates, local wine, beautiful flowers, and baked treats that were waiting for us on the table when we arrived. They also allowed us to rent a couple kayaks and Marlene's husband dropped us off up river for a truly fantastic afternoon on the water. We saw bald eagles, hawks, turtles, and jumping Asian Carp, and didn't see another person the whole time! After 3-4 hours on the water, we pulled up right beside the house. Super easy!
The cabin was very clean and well appointed inside, though the exterior is a little buggy (mostly harmless spiders, but one or two stinging bugs to look out for). It has a fairly new interior with newer windows and doors. The kitchen contains a full-sized range, oven, and microwave, and a mini-fridge. The bedroom has a queen sized bed with a soft mattress on a wobbly frame. The mattress had a thick plastic cover under the fitted sheet which was both a little noisy and somewhat uncomfortable (sweaty) to sleep on.
The location is on the water as pictured, but it's a bit of a walk down a dirt embankment to a shore made of large irregular concrete blocks.
If you're sensitive to smells, let them know ahead of time so they can unplug the air fresheners.
We appreciated Marlene's guidance on some interesting things to do in the area. My sense is that they will answer any questions you have and address any concerns you share to the best of their abilities.
All told, it was a lovely place to stay and I can't speak highly enough of Marlene and Marvin. They are attentive, honest, and helpful hosts who are committed to helping their guests have a good visit.
Also, if you're looking for a place that is more secluded, you might prefer another cabin they own that is a bit more rustic. We might stay there on our next visit if it's available!"

The fridge was a little small but we managed to fit all we needed for 6 days. Checking in and out was very simple and the cleanliness was top notch. We didn’t find a ton to do in Peru but within an hour of the house there was plenty to keep us entertained. All in all I would recommend to any group of 2 who wants a nice place on the river.

I unplugged the air fresheners, but the residual fragrance continued to bother my allergies. This isn't an issue for most people, but it can be a REALLY BIG issue for some.
Also, the dorm room style refrigerator doesn't hold a lot and turned our milk to ice.
Otherwise, it was clean, quiet, and everything worked as it should.
I would stay there again, if I could get her to remove the air fresheners a few days before our arrival."

The kitchen is fully equipped for making meals. The heating system was a little confusing at first but once it was up and running the place stayed nice and warm. Peru is a pleasant small town that is easily within walking distance or a quick drive from the location with numerous little dives to check out.

It is nice and bright with good lighting and 3 nice ceiling fans. Yes the bed I saw mentioned in a review is small just a double, though that is all that would be able to fit. I don’t think I saw mentioned as an option, there is an air mattress there and I wouldn’t have hesitated to set that up on the clean floor with the extra bedding available.

It’s so clean and well organized. Marlene has a lot of really thoughtful touches - good snacks (Frosted Flakes!! 🤤), toiletries, a few dvds and games, and plenty of towels. The WiFi and streaming worked well. The bed was comfy and the decor was well done. Oh, and the water pressure in the shower was amazing.
Having the river right out the backdoor was really nice and the backyard has a fire pit and some firewood (didn’t get to use it bc of rain but looking forward to that next time). I do need to mention that the next door neighbor had a confederate flag in the window, which made us uncomfortable. We did not see or interact with them at any time. Obviously this is out of Marlene’s control and she was nothing but kind and welcoming to us.
The town of Peru is quite small but we found a few places to eat and a great ice cream place.
Marlene was a wonderful host. Had to reach out a couple times and she was very kind and super responsive. Overall, we were really happy with Marlene and this little cottage!"

Stayed one night","The house sits atop a hill over looking the Wabash river. Nestled under the shade of several trees is this very clean comfortable home. You have your choice for outdoor seating either on the front or back porch. After a quiet night's rest, I awoke early, made a fresh batch of dark roast coffee and sat quietly on the back porch listening to the early morning sounds. Then as the sun began to rise, the sky turned from pink to orange as I walked down to the rivers edge, there I sat and gazed long enough to watch as 2 bald eagles, the female carrying a fish. They both flew so close that I could see the color of their eyes. As they stopped in mid air and flew up over head, red tailed carp rolled in the shallow waters below. If you enjoy quiet, peaceful moments in time, you're gonna love this little oasis."

Stayed one night","Janet was an amazing host. She greets you when you arrive and makes you feel welcomed. She goes out of her way and provides extras like sodas, candy, coffee, and popcorn, etc. available for your use. Janet is the hostess with the mostest! She is very kind and compassionate She gives you privacy as well. The cabin was great!!! It was very comfortable. It is a great getaway. It is close to wonderful local restaurants. It is next to the Grissom Air Force Museum which was fantastic. My son and I enjoyed great father and son time. The cabin comfortably sleeps two people. But there are three other rentals onsite if you are traveling with other couples. It is a beautiful place at a reasonable price. We also enjoyed the donkey and horses onsite. She has available kayaks, corn hole, hot tub and sauna. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing and rocking chairs. I would highly recommend Janet's. place if you need a peaceful retreat from the busy hustle of every day life. We plan to return."

She has lived there her whole life and went out of her way to make us feel at home. The fridge was stocked with a variety of name brand soda pop and the bathroom was even full of toiletries. There were plenty of towels and wash rags available as well. I highly recommend this listing.

Janet is an amazing host and checking in and out was a breeze. We have already recommended this place to friends and will definitely stay here again."

Use small to medium size containers if you plan on bringing food. We had to do a bit of Tetris, but managed to fit everything.
There is a fenced in area where your dog can run off leash. Lovely horses on property to admire."

Stayed a few nights","Words cannot express how grandiosely my expectations were blown in the matter of the 2 seconds it took to put my code in the keypad and open the door. The pictures are fine, but the actual space is super cute, comfortable, extremely clean, and remarkably quiet, even being on the bottom floor of a multi-apartment dwelling. I felt safe in the area, which was extremely close to the Amateur Circus (my reason for being in the area) and my other favorite Peru spots.
Linda was so very kind and a real pleasure to communicate with. She has paid attention to every detail (*except one tiny request) and even put in extra touches, like juice drinks chilling in the refrigerator and York Peppermint Patties on the bedside table!
I really enjoyed everything about Linda’s listing and will definitely stay at this location again!
*I’ve been so spoiled by my recent AirB&B hosts that I just took for granted that this location would have shampoo available in the shower/bathroom.But that was my fault."

Stayed one night",This is what I would call an efficiency apartment. You walk into the kitchen area with no table and chairs for morning coffee. and straight ahead is the bed and off from that is the stand up shower and small sink and toilet. One wing back chair is beside the bed. You also have to do your own dishes before you leave which I think should be the host responsibility to assure for the next guest that they are cleaned right. I don’t remember reading that before I made our reservation.

Stayed a few nights","Linda is an excellent host who provides guests a comfy place in a very walkable neighborhood. This little apartment is fairly quiet, under other apartments, at the back of the attached building with a dedicated private parking space for one car. There is a full kitchen with stove/range, mini-fridge stocked with water and a couple of sugar sodas. Perfectly stocked cupboards with cookware, dishware, etc. However, there was no place to eat, and no warning of this before we booked. Only one chair and it was a big wing chair, not one that you could move around for eating. There's just no room for small table & 2 chairs in current kitchen configuration. So we needed to eat every meal out, rather than being able to cook. For one person, it would have been easy to cook, then eat by the bed in the wing chair, but for two people, it was impossible. Internet was excellent and fast, but as stated, no place for 2 people to work on laptops at the same time, unless one is in the bed. We were there in winter (snow, down to around 20 F at night), and the whole apartment stayed toasty warm. Didn't use the TV, which is atop a dresser, with router behind. Huge closet for your suitcases and hanging clothes. Tiny bathroom with it's own room heater! All-in-all this was a great stay in a sparking clean and pretty private apartment in the best part of downtown."

The space was the perfect size for the two of us, and the kitchen accommodated cooking anything from a full meal to a midnight snack. LOVED the shower! It’s huge, and the tile is beautiful! The location couldn’t get better. You are right on the edge of downtown, so walking to local shops and restaurants is quick and a blast! It is also incredibly close to grocery stores and other restaurants throughout the town!

The place is stand alone house, so there was no one above or below us, which is perfect. If you're looking for a romantic getaway for two, this is definitely the spot!

If you are a fan of memory foam mattresses, the bed will serve you well. Also, be prepared to take a bath instead of a shower. It might be tough for those who are elderly though. The kitchen is very small and limited, so you may want to eat out instead. We didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment because we were visiting our son, who was at Culver Academies for the summer, so it was a good place to stay for that purpose."

Our suite was very quiet and restful, and everything we needed was there. We had one minor issue (my fault!) that required us to call the hosts, and they were super-helpful and responsive. We had a wonderful time, and really enjoyed our stay. If you are looking for a great place to stay in or near Peru, this is it!"

It doesn’t have a shower which I had not noticed when booking but it does have a hand held shower head in a big tub which was not too bad and kind of made you feel like royalty. It was clean and comfy!!! And Cole was very responsive and helpful.

Julie and Russ have put their heart and souls into caring for this vintage home, with modern amenities it's fresh, super clean, there's not a thing out of place, but very homey, we slept great! From relaxing on the big front porch to a fully, and I mean a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom, they have you taken well care of! You have several good choices of restaurants to enjoy when you're out and about too."

Blue Swing delivered: it’s a much cozier, homier, and more walkable alternative to the local hotels. Russ & Julie were outstanding hosts, very personable and professional, and ensured the apartment was well-stocked with absolutely everything you could possibly need. And the apartment was SPOTLESS. Looking forward to staying there on our next visit!"

Russ and Julie have put a lot of thought and hard work into making this place comfortable for the guests. I dont think there is anything i could have needed that wasn't already there. It was very clean and beautifully decorated. Bed was comfortable and i felt right at home. There was a binder put together with all the local attractions including restaurants and other things to do while in town. Julie was very responsive when i had questions and provided excellent recommendations when i asked. There were some local treats left for me upon arrival and Russ and Julie met me to show me around the place. Very friendly and informative. I couldnt have asked for better hosts. I would absolutely stay here again if i come back to the area.

This place was awesome and homey. The only thing we missed was a coffee pot as there was a keurig and plenty of those coffees but we are coffee snobs and forgot our travel pot but made it ours on the stove the old fashioned way.

The only ""negative"" is that the TV in the living room was rather small, but it's such a cozy place that unplugging/not watching TV is probably a good thing.

The hosts have done an amazing job making an exquisite private guest house that is separate but close to teh main house. The details show their abilities. The porch, outdoor seating area and the interior is dripping with personal touches and craftsmanship. The woodwork, carpentry, handmade quilts, and attention to a farm style decor is all very wonderful. The location is quiet and very, very clean. Even the porch and outdoor seating areas look like they get regular attention. The grounds were extremely tidy. We stayed in an upstairs area that had stairs, but we are fit and able so it was no problem. The unit had two bedrooms, one had hand painted murals. There is one full bath (walk-in style tub/shower) for the two rooms and it is standard guest bathroom sized for an average house and clean and tidy. The kitchen was very generous, and fully functional. We will stay again and next time we'll bring our two young daughters."

Great touches inside were mixed with all the amenities we could need.

Context- I had a last minute personal trip that I had to run to with a few of friends. It came up quick and I didn’t have much time to react. We had to drive all night and needed a place to stay for the weekend.
Communication: Due to the nature of my trip, someone replying to me quickly and efficiently was something we really needed so we could get on the road ASAP. Jayne responded quickly and efficiently.
She was patient and warm in her responses about my questions (which I found out later, some of the answers I needed were already in her listing, my apologies!).
Hospitality: Jayne was incredibly warm in answering my questions. She was also personable in her responses and her amenities. She left us continental breakfast stating that we might need the “COFFEE” :).
Since we drove all night, it would mean checking in early would be a major advantage because we would be arriving very early and very tired. My host was flexible in allowing us to come early which meant the world to us. We were very tired from driving 14 hours.
One of my friends was outside and happened to run into her husband when she was outside. She said that he was a very pleasant individual and enjoyed their conversation. He even asked if there was anything he could do to improve our stay which was super appreciated.
Airbnb: Our cute place exactly like the photos (so accurate marketing!). It was a quiet and comfy home in Peru, IN. Our hosts took their time in adding personal touches to the home from decorations to plates and coffee mugs. We slept very well in the cozy and comfortable beds. The place was clean and spotless when we got it.
One cool amenity with this Airbnb different from most was an outside shower. This shower was located right under the deck stairs. A couple of my friends thought that it was the coolest thing in the world and tried it out.
Thank you for an amazing stay. ❤️
6/5 stars."

Stayed with kids","Far beyond what we expected! Extremely clean! A great breakfast variety! The set up for the kids with the extra bed and the cute comforter which my 6 year old loved were above and beyond. ❤️ They absolutely loved the yard and the tree swing. We slept so well in the comfy beds and enjoyed drying off after our showers with your super soft towels. 😃 Having breakfast on the deck was just lovely. Super quaint and quiet. We will definitely be coming back to stay next time we are in Indiana! Thank you so much for a great experience!

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place to stay, look no further! This is ideal for all travel parties, including children. The space is larger than the pictures show and the deck is huge! We had aunts and cousins over with plenty of room inside or on the deck. Staying on the farm reminded me of home and where I came from. It is beautiful outside and Jayne has really put her craft-style stamp on the inside, every nook and cranny. This accommodation exceeded my expectations! If I can attach pictures I will. Thanks, Jayne!!"

Stayed one night","The stay was Lovely for a quick overnight. For the price, the owner did provide cereal, milk, and coffee for our family for breakfast. I also drew to the owners attention and extraordinary amount of bees crawling under the gutter. With a child allergic to bees, the owner sprayed the area and allowed our family to use the side entrance to avoid contact. The apartment above their barn was clean, and allowed our family to comfortably sleep five as the owner also provided an extra mattress for our children. Lovely experience overall and would recommend the barn apartment to other families.Finally, the owner also was beyond responsive in messages and quickly addressed things. We had no issues and were able to check ourselves in. We didn’t even meet the owner during our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Grateful Earth Farm Guest House was the perfect place for us to stay as we returned to Peru for a family funeral. Although we grieved, we were comforted by its peaceful surroundings and the nostalgic decor. Jayne was flexible with our scheduling requests and when we arrived, late in the evening, the lights were on and the kitchen had been stocked with nourishing foods. Everything was spotlessly clean and we really felt at home. The bath linens were as soft as clouds. Had it not been rainy weather, we would have spent even more time on the outdoor balcony to watch the birds in the meadow and listen to the pond frogs sing in the evening (there was a tv with cable, but with such a view, we never needed it!) Such a nice place, kind people, and very comfortable, the essence of Hoosier hospitality."

Jayne welcomed us and made sure there wasn’t anything she’d forgotten before running to the store, which was very thoughtful. She is an amazing host who thought of everything! There were bagels, muffins, fresh fruit to eat. She had coffee, milk, orange juice to drink! The space was spotless, beautifully decorated, and felt like home. I must say she also had the fluffiest towels ever too! I, 100%, recommended staying in the Grateful Earth Farm guest house."

Stayed one night","I would give Grateful Earth Farm (and Jayne!) far more than five stars, if I could. If you are questioning whether you should stay at this Airbnb, question no more. You will not find a nicer, cleaner, more charming and wonderful place to stay than this one. A few months back my brother and I had planned to visit several state historic sites in northern Indiana. I looked at many Airbnbs in Fort Wayne and Lafayette and all the cities in between. After much research, I decided on Grateful Earth Farm. I am so glad I did! Jayne stayed in touch from the time of my initial request onward and answered my inquiries promptly. We found the place to be absolutely spotless and incredibly warm and welcoming – Hoosier Hospitality at its best! She thought of everything – from coffee, juice, milk, fruit, bagels with cream cheese, muffins, cinnamon bread and cereal for breakfast to toiletries, magazines, fluffy towels and the most comfortable beds ever. We spent Sunday morning eating the leisurely breakfast provided by Jayne and relaxing on the deck before our departure. My brother was truly taken aback by the Jayne’s kindness and consideration. He simply couldn’t believe all that she did to make our stay perfect. Jayne, a heartfelt thank you from the two of us. You made our wonderful weekend infinitely better. - Nan"

Stayed one night",Jayne's house was one of the nicest Air Bnb's I've stayed in! She was so hospitable. I was in town for a wake/funeral and she was kind enough to give us a couple extra hours so we didn't have to pack up before the funeral. She left lots of snacks and breakfast food. The decorations were adorable and the place was spotless. My favorite part was watching the stars on the huge deck attached to the house. I would highly recommend Jayne's place!!

I was looking forward specifically to enjoying the hot tub. However, I discovered that the hot tub was in an indoor room on the lower level of the house next door. I expected it to be outside and close to the cabin. So I decided not to use it. But the rest of the experience made up for the disappointment."

Stayed one night","Can't begin to express how unhappy I was with this attempted reservation.
I chose the property as it looked to have potential, paid, then waited.
And waited and waited. I reached out to host via text, phone and AirBNB messaging. No responses. I assumed I would get one, and continued my drive in the direction of the AirBnb. 30 mintues past, than an hour, then more hours. No contact from host. No directions or instructions on how to stay.
Arrived in the general area still without contact. Stress level rose. Contacted Airbnb. They tried to reach Janet, couldn't.
So I was stuck. Listing said ""no refunds"". There were no hotels in area. It was getting dark.
what should have been a stress free stay in a cute cottage turned into an expense ridden journey, where I had to backtrack many miles to find a hotel. Additionally spent a good four hours in text and phone conversations with Air bnb just to get a refund for this place.
Dont be surprised if you get no response from host after paying!"

Stayed one night","We wanted to get away for a day to celebrate our anniversary. We chose Janet’s cabin because it was adorable and just a 2 hour drive distance. We were also able to bring our dog, which was a great relief and help. We enjoyed a meal at a restaurant Janet recommended and then enjoyed a wonderful evening together. The weather threw us a curve ball, but we laughed it off and knew we were still safe. Thank you Janet for calling and offering your home to us. We totally recommend her cabins to anyone looking for a quiet get away."

Stayed over a week",I had a wonderful stay. Janet is very welcoming and will help in any way she can. There was a real bad storm and she invited me up to the basement to wait it at. Is just one example of how much they make you feel like you’re at home.

Stayed a few nights","Janet was a kind and welcoming host. The cabin was beautiful, and just as described. Janet even called ahead to okay a minor furniture swap; it’s clear she cares a lot! We did experience one minor miscommunication, but Janet went above and beyond to fix the situation. We’re already excited to go back!"

Stayed over a week","Janet is not just your typical owner. She makes you feel like family, she take the time to get to know you and LOVES to have coffee and chit chat. She is truly amazing and helpful more than any other host I have ever done with. I feel like part of her family and not just a guest."

Stayed a few nights","Janet is an amazing host! She was very informative and helpful. She was the kind of host, I felt like i could of asked anything for and she would of went out of her way. I felt like my stay was also private. I wish i got around to the hot tub, but was enjoying the mini cabin too much."
