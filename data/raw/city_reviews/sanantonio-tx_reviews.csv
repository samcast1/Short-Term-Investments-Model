Stayed a few nights","Sarah was wonderful. Our lives were and still are turning upside down. We had to cut out trip short, and she helped us figure out how to handle that. We needed a can opener, and she got us one. She was kind, helpful, and understanding.
Her place is just as described. While it is small, it is so perfectly furnished such that you have everything you need without feeling crowded. Sarah's place is affordable and comfortable and very nice. It was just what we needed. There were even plenty of shelves and cabinets in the bathroom for toiletries and such, something you don't often find in small spaces."

We enjoyed sitting on the deck. Sarah left coffee and creamer. She was very friendly and responded quickly to any questions we had. It was about 20ish minutes to downtown SA and 35ish minutes to Guadalupe State Park. Great location!"

The only downside was lack of places to hang clothes. There is a small space in the bathroom which doubles as a towel rack, which was awkward for us because we didn’t want our clothes wet from the towels. Even so, we felt comfortable and enjoyed our visit."

Stayed one night","The studio space is a nice spot to come into after a day of travel and sightseeing. The pretty blue door, small private front patio area and driveway parking at the rear are very handy to get in and out of the unit. It was quiet and peaceful.
The unit is attached to the back of a private home, but is it’s own space with private, keypad entry. The hosts are responsive but respectful of privacy.
The kitchenette is just the right size with a two seater table, a well stocked coffee bar (thanks!), small fridge and microwave.
The queen bed and linens are comfortable and nice as are the bath linens. The shower has body wash, shampoo and conditioner as well as a hair dryer.
The location made it easy for us to head out the next morning towards Del Rio. We would stay again if in the area."

Stayed a few nights",Sarah is an amazing host. She communicated well. Very responsive and respectful. The home is beautiful and quite. Well worth the price. Anytime i come to San Antonio I will always book with her. She allowed extended check out. Offered to spend time with her and her family. I am well pleased with my experience. I will give Sarah a 10 out of 10 rating.

Stayed a few nights","Sarah's place was exactly what we were hoping for - easy to find, peaceful and quiet, had everything we needed! Sarah was incredibly easy to communicate with and proactive. We were part of the Southwest Airlines meltdown during Christmas, and Sarah was very accommodating and easy to work with when we had 3 am check-in and then needed to extend our reservation on the fly. The place was cozy, easy to find, and very homey. Exactly what we needed!"

the only downfall is my mom is only 5'3 and she couldn't reach the shower head so my dad had to adjust it for her.

Daniel & Levi were extremely responsive whenever we reached out for something. We didn’t have to reach out much due to the detailed instructions and all the supplies the home had to offer. We would def recommend staying at this home.

We stayed for 3 weeks so it was very much appreciated. One of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in!"

The location was perfect. We could not have picked a better spot. Walking distance to The Pearl and several restaurants and walk up bars right along the Riverwalk gave us plenty to do without having to drive.
The couch sofa would not have been comfortable to sleep on for myself or my husband but it was fine for our 8 year old. The sheets were missing the first night but Richie got a set dropped off as soon as I messaged him about it. Again, he was very responsive and easy to reach.
The apartment was clean overall but you can tell the cleaners need to do a deeper clean soon.
I would definitely book with Richie again because the location was so perfect!"

There was a little confusion with the parking, but Ritchie was helpful and responded quickly, which I appreciated. The area was FANTASTIC! We walked along the River Walk to the Pearl daily. We were pleasantly surprised by Elsewhere Garden Bar and Kitchen which was directly across the street. It was a lively place with tons of good food, libations, and a good place to take your kids or pets. I would happily stay at his place again and I highly recommend it. Happy Travels ☺️"

Wish that the pool was heated as we visited in the winter, but not Richie’s fault. The keyless entry system was a little confusing at first, but actually pretty cool once we got used to it. Nice to not have to always look for a key. Awesome to have secure, free, garage parking. Everyone in the building was so nice. Richie was helpful and kind. Would stay again!"

We also walked to a busier area of the River Walk and easily caught a Lyft home when we got tired. The apartment was clean and comfy with lots of natural light. Thank you, Richie, for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights",Richie’s place was amazing. We had some hot water issues but Richie was right on top of the problem immediately. The rooftop was an amazing place to relax in the sun. The kitchen had everything to making cooking a breeze. Having robes was a real plus. Elsewhere is right across the street-great open air bar/food. Totally decorated for the holidays. Commonwealth coffee shop also right across the street. Easily walkable to the Pearl district. The Emma hotel is a must to go in and wander around. It use to be the Pearl Brewery. The river walk is right around the corner and was beautiful. Would definitely stay here again.

We planned on grilling in the common area outside but didn’t get around to it. The personal parking spot is clutch. Walkability was perfect either at street level or Riverwalk to all the bars and restaurants. At the time of this review, ride shares were so affordable when we didn’t want to be a designated driver :) the apartment was spacious and quiet (faces the courtyard). Richie was easy to get a hold of when we needed something. We loved it so much we extended our stay. Don’t hesitate to book this!!"

Great response time which was appreciated as The Latch app didn’t work one night and we were able to get ahold of someone that gave us a code at midnight so we could get inside the building. It is quite a walk to the restaurants on the Riverwalk but the plus side is it is quiet at night. Highly recommend an Uber or Lyft to get home as there were a lot of homelessness around late at night. Beyond that everything went perfect. Thank you Richie!"

Stayed a few nights","Location is ideal. Right next to The San Antonio Museum of Art. Exit the building and you're right on the river. Walk either direction and there's everything you're looking for. There wasn't any furniture on the balcony, it wasn't listed it in the description, but you don't need it. Head down the hallway to the rooftop deck and you have views of the river and great sitting areas. There is an EV charging station right behind the parking space but Ritchie didn't know how to use it and it took a while to get the card that you need to operate it. I ended up just using the supercharger stations outside the city instead. Communication with Ritchie was quick except for the EV charging card. Everything was nice in the unit but could have used sharper cutting knives, a peeler, some scissors and some food storage containers. Everything else is there to cook with. Check out was simple and the app used to move throughout the building was easy to use. I would definitely recommend staying here."

This area has many food/entertainment choices nearby, we easily walked downtown and to Pearl. Cute little food truck area within a block. Bike share and scooters available on the same street. We didn’t really need a car.
All the things you need for a stay were included (like laundry pods & dishwasher pods).
Good for couples and I would feel safe/secure staying solo. Would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","I will list the pros and cons of our stay at this accommodation:
Cons:
-We got in late our first night and did not have any sheets for the pull out bed. The next afternoon sheets were delivered to our doorstep but they were unwashed (new) and the wrong size so we had to waste some time washing and drying them prior to use.
-Garbage can did not have a liner when we arrived.
-You have to use an app on your phone as a hotel key of sorts. It gets you into the parking garage and other places around the accommodation. Unfortunately, at least one gate would not open this way (saying the gate needed to be “updated”) so it was kind of a hassle.
-On our second to last day, a car parked in our assigned spot and didn’t move for the rest of our stay.
-While the accommodation is on the river walk, it is a pretty lengthy walk to the main part of the river walk.
Pros:
-Relatively quick response from host.
-On the river (though a ways from the main river walk area).
-A/C and W/D"

What stood out about this location was the access to Riverwalk and all the great restaurants and activities. Additionally, I liked that the property had quiet time so you could actually get sleep and rest. It is hard for me to rest in a hotel because of the noise. The apartment itself was beautifully decorated and had everything you’d need. Access everywhere was a short Uber ride away. The host was always communicative and friendly. This was a top notch AirBNB and I would not hesitate staying there again."

Less than a mile to Houston St. and a half mile to the Pearl. Only time we drove anywhere, was to golf. We ate at incredible restaurants and we lucked out with the weather. We had an absolute incredible 4 days. Thank you Richie!"

Group trip","The apartment was clean and well stocked with fun decor. The beds were comfortable.
The amenities in the complex were very disappointing. The pool is nothing like the pictures. It was small and dirty. And the waterfall feature wasn't running. The fitness center smelled terribly of mold/mildew. You can walk to Riverwalk but be prepared as it is a 30 - 40 min walk. But a cheap Uber ride so the location is still convenient
Be sure to bring in all your valuables as we saw a few cars in the parking garage with smashed windows.
All the issues were not Pete and Katrina's fault as they maintain a very nice apartment. But just be aware before you expect to use the ""amenities""."

Highly recommend this place and would definitely use it in the future."

We ate at a good burger place that was a 5 min walk. We also swam in the freezing cold pool this time of year but my 8 year old loved it! We enjoyed our stay very much"

We did have to buy an inexpensive spatula because kitchen didn’t have one. We only made breakfast so not a big deal. Dishwasher and washer/dryer had soap and worked great. Gym and rooftop patio were amazing! Condo complex is safe/secure and plenty of easy parking. We can’t wait to come and stay again!"

However, this location was so much better. There is a fantastic little outdoor bar that serves food from next door and the best meal the trip came from a place just a few steps down the road. There is little strip mall with more bars, craft beers and even a speakeasy right across the street. We much preferred this to the overrated, overpriced, chain restaurants and establishments on the Riverwalk."

Stayed a few nights","super clean and exactly as shown. may have just had a renovation because everything looked brand new inside the place.
This condo was perfect for our girls trip. we felt safe and it was close to the Alamodome for a concert. The description of being walkable is in the eye of the beholder. The Riverwalk is indeed close by, but that section of the Riverwalk isn't close to any attractions.
The beds and linens and towels were all very nice.
It would have been nice to have a table and chairs on the fabulous balcony. Just standing out there lost all appeal pretty quickly. And picking up the fob to get into the building was a bit quirky, but we managed it.
Having said that, I would totally book this space again."

It’s in an up-and-coming area so you’ll see a lot of construction around.
If you cross the street towards the river you can walk along the path all the way to Riverwalk (it’s a 15-20 min walk).
You do need a car or Uber to move around and go to attractions, though.
There’s a small supermarket and bars across the street.

Had a hiccup with the TV, but they tried remedying it and even bought us a gift card and flowers due to the inconvenience. We will definitely stay here again.

If you’ve been to San Antonio before, like I have for years- staying here was my little oasis! The entire property is absolutely divine! Donna created the most welcoming & relaxing environment. I was blown away with how comfortable the place made me feel. Easy street parking up front, awesome private entrance, & once you’re inside- you’ll big smile because of how well she designed and decorated the space. You can chill on the couch, eat at the gigantic breakfast bar, or have some tea/coffee (she provides both!) at the little table. The bathroom is well lit (ladies- make up application was a dream here! White light at the huge bathroom mirror + lots of natural light in the bedroom!) THE BED WAS A MAGICAL CLOUD OF DREAMS!!!! I don’t even understand because my husband loves firm beds and I’m more into softer beds but some how we both got great sleep. Rent it!!!"

But even if your reason for staying has nothing to do with said University, Donna's location is centrally located and mere minutes from almost anything you'd wish to do. Her instructions are perfect, the decor is comfortable and beautifully eclectic, and we felt incredibly secure--as well as grateful to have found such a GEM! My daughter and I have stayed at several properties in the area, and this is--hands down--our favorite, but shhh.... don't tell anyone, because I'm hoping it is available every time I come to town.

We had some plumbing problems that I am certain Donna has taken care of now, but could not fix while we were there so we had to check out early and of course Donna refunded for the days we booked but could stay there.
We’d stay again when back in San Antonio. Thanks Donna!"

Stayed a few nights","Don't even think twice about it. BOOK THIS PLACE!! This Airbnb is so quaint and charming. It looked just like the pics. Super clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable, shower was hot and although I didn't use it, I love that there is a washer and dryer. I arrived an hour too early (forgot about the time change) but Donna allowed me to come in and rest from traveling while she finished cleaning. She even offered me some water. She's super sweet and was very responsive throughout my stay. I was there over New Year's and she even invited me to her backyard get together (I declined because I just wanted some me time) but it was super nice of her to invite me. I don't have anything negative to say about this home. It's close to everything- Downtown, Riverwalk, The Pearl, The Japanese Tea Garden all are just minutes away with Uber. I'd stay here again if I'm ever in San Antonio again."

We took a walk one morning through this awesome historic neighborhood, and there was a very good burger place nearby that everyone should try if they like a good burger!

Rafael is a very nice gentleman that is very helpful when you ask. Other than that privacy is at its highest here. I had the liberty to come and go at any time of the day or night.
This place was very clean with lots of room for my bags while traveling.
The bathroom was clean and more than enough for one person. The bed is very comfortable.
I'd highly recommend this place to stay if you're wanting a quiet and private place to stay that is clean and want to relax."

Stayed a few nights","Area: I thought this place was in the middle of nowhere and no one around so I was a bit nervous as a female but there were several well established homes in the area without taking away from the sense of space and being in the country so I felt much safer without feeling like I'm being monitored lol
Inside: it was as photographed. clean and cute. not fancy but very homey. There is a TV where you can watch Netflix and few other streaming services. if you like fluffier and or firmer pillows, I'd bring your own. nothing wrong with them but may not be for everyone. the shower was warm and had good pressure. there's basic kitchen items so we were able to save some money and cook for ourselves in between if we needed to.
Our Hosts: they were very kind and welcoming. they were attentive without being overwhelming. if you message them, they respond in adequate time!"

Stayed about a week","What a Lovely stay! This tiny home was a wonderful get away for my husband and I for our anniversary! The home was easy to find, easy to get into, and had a host that was fast with their responses! We had a rollercoaster of weather, thankfully they had a window AC that cooled the home completely and heaters that heated the space rather quickly! There is a fridge and a microwave (good for those leftovers) and a stove and pots that were very handy! BE CAREFUL that you don't flush toilet paper!!! I had to fish it out a couple of times due to habit. I highly recommend bringing a travel bidet- it works wonders! You do share a space (grill, campfire, patio, and table) with the RV next door, always fun getting to know new people! It's only about 30 minutes out from San Antonio but only 10 from the nearest HEB and some fast food options. It's secluded but still near everything! We had an amazing stay and are so excited to go back some day! Highly recommend this BNB!"

Stayed a few nights","Really nice little place way out. Rafael responded quickly to questions and his instructions for check-in were very good. Please be sure to make note of not flushing toilet paper. Thankfully there's a handy sign by the toilet to remind you. It's a reflex... My review would be five stars but for a couple of things, like a bathroom door that likes to open itself. I've been married for 37 years, but I still like to go in private. And it's impossible to close it quietly enough to not wake the wife. The only other thing is the TV that must have known that we weren't there to watch TV anyway. If we ever need a place way out on the west side of San Antonio in the future we would consider booking again."

We felt very comfortable there, had everything we needed and really appreciated the privacy on the grounds. I recommend checking in during day light times if you can so that you may find your way around easier but we still made out well despite our late check in. Parking was right in front of the tiny home. Just take your time and follow the well explained directions to your unit. Great value, very clean and just as described. Looking up at the moonlight was beautiful. Thanks again Raphael for being an awesome host."

Answer immediately for anything. Check in and out was easy as can be, with clear proactive directions. Nice big tv! With a surprisingly comfy futon. we didn’t even pull out the bed, It was comfy enough as a sofa. The neighbors are near, but you wouldn’t even know it. Definitely get your privacy.. this tiny house isn’t even tiny. Just impressive especially for the price. Do yourself a favor a book a stay here if you and your partner are looking to stay in San Antonio. Great option. all you need. super cute and quaint. PS there’s a Starbucks l5 minutes away, so you’re really not that far from civilization or anything like that. But the property makes you feel like you are. A gem"

The tiny house is really nice, clean and new. Everything was in working condition and I had no problems at all. The kitchen has dishes, glasses, utensiles and cookware. There were even some spices, coffee and all the basics. It's more than enough for a solo traveler and can fit a couple really comfortably.
The checking in and out process was a breeze. There is an RV right next to the tiny house, which is also for guests. There is a common area for BBQing. The starts at night look big and bright!"

Rafael came to help when I contacted him that there was a stray pitbull on the property, and he called animal control and took care of the issue. He came and helped me check in so that I would feel safe, and was very kind and apologetic about the dog even though it was out of his control. The Airbnb was very clean and cozy, and had everything I needed, which showed that it had been well thought out. Rafael’s communication was top of the line, and if I’m ever in the area again, I will stay here! 10/10 recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Rafael's tiny home is a great price and comfortable, with both cold air, Ceiling fan, and heat. His directions were perfect and he provided a code to the box as well as a remote for the gate to ease coming and going. FYI - There are no stores of any kind close by to this place, so make sure you bring your snacks and water with you, as there is a refrigerator but no bottled water or snacks provided. Also bring your own shampoo and conditioner. We thought it was a great price for the stay. Very quiet and relaxing. The other thing to consider is that there are NO lights on the roads leading to the house. We typically arrive in the evenings as we are visiting family in SA. If you are over 40 or have bad eyesight-arrive before dark! It is extremely difficult to see at night."

The tiny home is inside the gates of Rafael’s property and I felt safe coming and going as I wanted. Even though it’s called a tiny home, it was much bigger than I expected. It’s a very good size. It had everything I needed to make myself at home for the weekend. I’ll definitely be staying here again."

Lauren is super responsive and friendly. She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed and provided additional recommendations based on our interests. Could not have asked for the better interaction with a host. The apartment itself is ADORABLE. The sweet little touches of local history, art pieces and antiques showcase the talent Lauren has for making an apartment that is a vacation rental feel like you are at home. The location is amazing - My mom and I were on a Girls Trip and walked everywhere downtown. We even got to watch the cathedral light show from our own window! 100% recommend this rental. We will definitely stay again if we are ever back in San Antonio!"

The Riverwalk was just around the building. 2nd floor balcony was great to have a drink and watch people on the Riverwalk. Lauren added extra amenities and bathroom supplies, including window shades throughout the apartment The AC system worked great which is a absolute necessity in Texas.
We used the Bexar public parking for $12/night per Lauren's instructions. The car was safe and only a 5 minute walk away from the building.
Lauren was very responsive to every email we sent prior to our visit
Definitely will stay with Lauren's apartment rentals when back in San Antonio"

Great views of downtown area — courthouse, historical buildings, beautiful chapel. Lots of quiet courthouse weddings to put you in a good mood. There are a few different parking options, but we really loved the $15/day lot that is just 1-2 blocks away. The riverwalk is one minute around the corner.
Lauren was very responsive and helpful. Place smells great, but not overwhelming. Very tidy. Bed is very cozy memory-foam type of mattress. Very soft sheets! Well ventilated with great ceiling fans. Property is also very secure.
I hope this property’s historical charm is always preserved. Super charming and can’t wait to go back!"

The light through the huge windows (and views of a historic mission and the court house) was really special, something only a historic building can provide. It’s the kind of Airbnb where you want to enjoy the life of the city around it (and everything is so walkable) but also don’t want to leave the apartment because it’s just so comfortable and attractive. Lauren has thought of everything in decorating and stocking the apartment, too. This is the opposite of sterile, generic Airbnbs that one might find otherwise. Everything in the space is subtly imbued with San Antonio spirit. Lauren is very friendly and prompt with communication. A five-star experience all around!"

She even had some nail polish and nail polish remover that was super helpful. (I forgot to redo my nails for the wedding I’m here for.) It was really kid friendly, too! It had the basics, like a pack-n-play, but even had kid toys and books! The view is amazing and the place is well decorated. Our friends who spent the night on the pullout sofa bed said it was the most comfortable pullout they have ever slept on! Great location, easy to walk to the river, and beautiful views of the courthouse and plaza. 10/10 would recommend! Thanks!"

We really appreciated the coffee the first morning (and all the mornings). We loved the windows - the light show on the cathedral is really cool. Great food and drinks every day and I only gained one pound because we walked everywhere. And I do mean everywhere - Lauren's place is in the most perfect location you could hope for. The riverwalk, the Alamo, the Pearl, La Villita, Japanese Garden, Tower of the Americas (twice). Two drinks and an appetizer at the Tower happy hour costs less than admission to the observation deck! The Dias de las Muertas parade and celebrations were great fun. We spent Halloween evening on King Williams handing out candy at the house of someone we just met that afternoon. People in SA are very friendly and helpful.
Lauren - thanks for providing such a fantastic place for our stay. We had a wonderful time - Mary and Carolyn"

Everything was sparkling clean and full of thoughtful details (like scratch pads in the nightstands, architect books open of the buildings nearby, umbrellas by the door…etc). The apartment complex was having issues with the A/C when we checked in, but Lauren was quick to respond and even dropped off an alternate cooling unit in case the building didn’t get up and going (they did). The location is truly in the middle of things. This was wonderful for us (wanting to do the river walk). The weekend was a little louder on the streets, but we are from the country and not used to ANY city noise so everything stands out to us. When the bedroom door was closed it was quiet. We would love to stay here again and will recommend it to any of our family traveling to San Antonio."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time staying at this location. It’s by far one of the most picturesque Airbnbs we’ve ever stayed at. The church across the street has light shows at night on the weekend, so it was very relaxing to comeback after a long day and sit comfortably while watching it from the apartment. Also, we loved the space so much, we decided to order breakfast to go so we could enjoy the views from the apartment! The host thought of everything and we felt so taken care of! We can’t recommend this place enough! This is a great spot for your next vacation!"

Stayed a few nights","Lauren's place was perfect for what our trip needed. It was close to so many things - between food options, being right on the river walk, close to historic / touristy options, and had reasonable parking available nearby. We loved it!
The space itself was exactly as described. It wasn't too loud for being right in the city, and the atmosphere was cozy. There was local coffee available (which we greatly appreciated), and Lauren was always proactive in her communication - making sure we always had all the details we needed.
I'd highly suggest her space if you're considering visiting the San Antonio area!"

Stayed a few nights","Lauren’s apartment was a real highlight of our time in San Antonio! The pictures almost don’t do it justice as the natural light and the effort of the interior is so incredible. The air-con was really good considering how old the building is and how hot it was during our stay. The bed was the comfiest bed we’d ever slept in. Coffee machine was easy to use. There were lots of books on Texas that were really interesting. The view was breathtaking of the courthouse with the huge windows. The host was flexible with late checkout to accommodate our luggage storage for a fee, and we met the cleaner who was very friendly."

Not only was the decoration welcoming, but the amenities as well. In the freezer was a pre-filled and frozen ice tray as well as a container filled with ice cubes. The fridge contained a Brita water pitcher also pre-filled. Among my favorite amenities was the tea and coffee bar, which offered several varieties of both coffee and tea. Lauren was also an amicable and very accommodating host, responding quickly to any messages I sent her as well as going above and beyond to work with me on adjustments I needed to make regarding the duration of my stay. The complex was also located within walking distance of several shops and eateries. All in all, a very pleasant experience."

Overall it was a very beautiful location as well. Our only issue was finding the free parking despite the map and directions provided.

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is very clean and comfortable, and looks just as pictured - the big windows and view of the plaza is lovely. Lauren, the host, provided lots of thoughtful touches - coffee, tea, extra toiletries in case you forgot something, and kitchen essentials. The location is close to all kinds of things - the riverwalk, and the San Fernando Cathedral show was awesome, don't miss this! The location is urban / downtown, so there was some increase in street noise at night over the weekend, as you would expect, but nothing extreme. We had a good experience using the Bexar County Parking Garage for overnight parking. Our experience of the apartment building was that is was quiet and felt safe, the hallway decor is a little quirky, but the apartment itself is a jewel!"

She provided all the essentials and more. It was clean, comfy, and right in the heart of downtown San Antonio.

Stayed one night","I mean, where do I really even start. This place spells country cute. A downtown loft that seems to be inspired from southern roots and a want to get lost in the city lights. We loved every second of our short stay here. From relaxing on the window nook to the comfort of the bed. You’ve truly built a place that makes you feel at home. It’s nice to have found a place we can stay when we are here in town. The proximity of the river walk and restaurants made it easy for us to step out for some food, grab a few drinks, and be back home to relax without much effort. To all who are reading this, the iron cactus is a short 4 minute walk, their lobster tacos were delightfully crafted, and the table side guacamole was perfect. And their cocktails and margaritas were superb. Along the walk you’ll notice a tiki bar, Hugmans Oasis, go there! It's such a fun little bar, great staff, great drinks, and a laid-back vibe."

She even put out multiple pastries for us which was such a nice touch. The surrounding area is super easy to walk around and find things to do, the Mexican restaurant downstairs is amazing!! It’s right across from the courthouse so we were able to watch hundreds of people get married on Valentine’s Day which was so beautiful. Everything that you might need is provided, cooking supplies, extra toiletries, blankets, umbrellas, etc. we are from the city so we don’t necessarily need a home away from home but when it’s available we will make this ours! 10000/10 experience.

The place itself is beautifully decorated, and thoughtfully supplied with local vendor types of things like the coffee and the pastries. The decorations, lighting, and accoutrements were wonderfully texan and artistically beautiful. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was exactly what you’d want. Quit looking around for other places in the area in this price range and do yourself a favor and book this place right now."

I made a mistake when accidentally only booking 1 night instead of 2 for her property, she was kind, patient and understanding and even helped me book one of her other properties. This saved our honeymoon and could have been a disaster. She was flexible and very patient with us. On top of that her property was gorgeous, spotless and very cozy. We will definitely be booking again for our anniversary trips!"

The property is right off I-10 in an older neighborhood with easy access to South Town restaurants. We were in town for the Alamo Bowl, a mere 6 miles away. The stairs/ladder to the bedroom loft are quite steep, so keep that in mind when booking. We’re active, fifty-somethings and were able to navigate it just fine. Even though we didn’t travel with our doggo this time, we always appreciate hosts who accommodate pups. This was a great value and suited us to a T. Thank you for your hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","This darling, modern little house was perfect for two women and a teen on a girls’ weekend. *Ideal location 8 minutes from the Alamodome*, and close to great neighborhood restaurants for those like me who do not want to pay for parking and tourist menus on the Riverwalk. Photos are accurate - in fact, it felt bigger than expected! Ample parking, a picket fence encloses a small grass yard, inviting porch; inside is a full kitchen, good sized living room, huge shower in the full bathroom, and a very comfortable queen bed in the loft. The neighborhood has many well-worn homes with a sprinkle of new homes popping up - this small house is tucked behind a large newer corner house, which adds a feeling of comfort and security. Renata communicated well and made us feel at home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, hope to stay again, and strongly recommend this Air B&B!"

I do have a slight fear of heights 😅 but I overcame it just so I could sleep in that cute bed space. The water pressure is amazing, the shower was wonderful and I felt very safe for my night stay.

Stayed a few nights","Lauren's AirBnB is Awesome! Lauren is like the ninja of hosts – super responsive and on the ball with every question we threw her way. It's right on the riverwalk, and literally a 1 minute walk to the river and very quiet. You can actually hear yourself think – it's that peaceful. And Lauren, she's thought of **everything**! It's like she's got this sixth sense for what you need before you even know you need it. The place is snug as a bug, super cozy, and just oozes homey vibes. Every nook and cranny is just where it should be, making the most of the space. And if you're worried about parking, don't be. It's a breezy walk away – less than 10 minutes, and you're parked and ready to explore. So, would I stay here again? In a heartbeat! Would I recommend it to you? Absolutely, So go ahead, book Lauren's place and thank me later. Thank you Lauren for everything!"

Otherwise I would have bought some to leave! 🤷‍♀️ We also only had 1 bathroom hand towel for a 5 night stay and 4 bath towels for the 2 of us showering at least 1 x day.

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this rental is clean, comfortable, and close to everything downtown. The Riverwalk was a short walk away, as was The Alamo.
Pros:
- Close to everything downtown
- Extremely clean and welcoming
- Mostly quiet building
- Easy to check in/out
- Lauren is kind and very responsive
Cons:
- There is a lot of “decor” that impedes space. I would not recommend more than 2 people rent this at a time. We were moving stuff around just to walk through the apartment.
- As the description says, maintenance can happen during your stay. However, we didn’t expect the strong smell of paint fumes to overtake the bathroom for hours. It was almost unusable due to the smell.
For the price, we’re not sure it’s 100% worth it. But, we did enjoy our stay and it worked for what we needed. Lauren was also very responsive and kind when we asked about check in."

FABULOUS ambiance appealing to all 5 senses with beautiful music & incredible fragrance upon opening the door to spotless, cute & cozy appt! Felt right at home! Huge windows (shades & drapes when needed), wonderful textiles, period woodwork/touches. Some unevenness with flooring as would be expected with buildings of this age. Huge bathroom with tub/shower; mind step up to enter BR & tub contour. Great set up for kitchen & coffee/tea bar! MANY thoughtful amenities provided!
Box fan provided was very helpful for noise cancellation for sleeping if needed.

The apartment is just as the pictures look! They provide all the amenities you need and some that you may not think of needing. If you are a light sleeper, you will hear noise from the sidewalk, but not too much that earplugs won't take care of.
The apartment building is right on the Riverwalk and next to the locks of love bridge. So much to explore in this area and easy to walk along the Riverwalk to explore other areas, like the Pearl. Close to great restaurants and bars. We will definitely stay here again if visiting San Antonio again!"

Everything was super clean the bathroom was spotless...I'm picky and I promise the place was very clean. We couldn't be happier we are sharing this space with all our friends!!

We found everything we needed in this studio...and more. Lauren thought of everything possible. & we wanted for nothing. The filtered water in the fridge was a great plus as we filled our water bottles daily. And the coffee bar had everything you need to have a cup in the morning. I would definitely stay there again if we return to San Antonio."

Unfortunately walls are very thin and my wife just heard a blaring TV all night and didn't get to sleep until 1am so that kind of ruined the trip, especially after paying $170 for 1 night. Only reason I'm not going lower on stars is because it is a nice clean place and host is very nice. perhaps we just got unlucky with the night we chose."

I loved the warmth of her apartment, lots of artistry and creativity in her decorations. It gave a nostalgic southwestern feel. Her place also felt clean, which is a definite plus! She had nice amenities such as coffee, games, and other things in the bathroom. All the extra touches made it special. It’s also located in a key location, the river walk with restaurants is right there. The only thing that’s not great is the parking. Those ppl will ticket you within minutes! Circle the block until the 15 min unload is available and the 5 dollar parking garage/per day is like a 6 min walk away. I definitely recommend. Thx for the lovely stay!"

Stayed with kids",Lauren's home is a gem. It is in a great location and it is surrounded by lots of historical history. The building is very historical unique & you can see the riverwalk from the 2nd floor balcony . It is about a 2 min. walk to an entrance to the riverwalk. Lauren suggested to park at the Bexar County parking garage & walk over to the apt. a 2 block walk. It was cheaper than the other paid parking lots. It worked perfectly for us since we did want to have to drive around. The longest distance that we walked up the riverwalk was 10 mins. to the Alamo & 10 mins. to the Historic Market. Lots of restaurants on the riverwalk. Lauren has thought of the little thing's that would make your stay more comfortable. Her little studio apt. is so adorable. Loved the decor. Lauren is an awesome host and she responds back quickly.

This place is nestled on the outer park of Riverwalk, which is nice to escape some of the walking traffic happening. It also means you see other great places to eat and visit that aren’t at the Riverwalk.
The studio is rich in decor just like San Antonio’s rich history.

The most difficult thing about this spot was really only the parking (which is an issue any time you stay in a downtown location anyway) and it is possible to get lucky and find some free parking nearby! The location is great, right off the river walk and close to so many cool local spots to check out. I was returning from visiting a friend in the area one night and made it just in time to see the San Fernando Cathedral light show! A great stay overall :)"

Stayed with kids","Honestly we could not have loved this place anymore than we did! It truly felt like a home away from home! Hunter and Taylor are friendly, accommodating and very genuine! Not surprised at all that their guest house was perfection, they take a lot of pride and care in making sure it is everything anyone would need and want! Super comfortable, bright, perfect sized space. The snacks and the toiletries all natural/eco friendly/non toxic, the linens all pure cotton bliss, the bed and the pillows super comfortable, the pots and pans all quality stainless steel... I could go on and on.... we will definitely be coming back to San Antonio, and will make sure it's at a time when Taylor and Hunter's guest house is available, would never want to stay anywhere else but here!"

The casita was strategically located close to every key point in San Antonio. Travel to/from downtown, missions and museums and the outlying areas of the city were exceptional. Within 20 minutes, we were able to venture into different parts of San Antonio effortlessly.
Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in San Antonio."

Located in a peaceful neighborhood, very close to Central Market and other local restaurants and shops. Beautiful, colorful decor as you walk in, personalized note and snacks were very much appreciated. House book was full of great suggestions on where to visit.

Stayed about a week","My daughter and I stayed at Taylor and Hunter's casita for a week. We loved the neighborhood. It was quiet, walkable, great restaurants nearby & easy to access major highways. We walked the neighborhood to enjoy the architecture of the homes, the landscaping, ~100 year old live oak trees and festive lights. It was magnificent. We also visited a nearby park and the Japanese tea garden. The hosts provided a guest guide that was extremely helpful in choosing restaurants and activities.
Cappy's restaurant was within walking distance and had fantastic patio seating. Cappy's became our neighborhood hangout.
The Bird Cafe is also excellent. We had breakfast there and purchased sandwiches to go for our flight.
Central Market was also within walking distance. We had never experienced anything like it. Just shopping in their produce section is a unique experience.
Taylor and Hunter were also very responsive to any questions we had during our stay.
We highly recommend staying here."

It’s well appointed and stocked. It’s also close to great restaurants and a market where you can get anything you need. We ventured out to the Riverwalk, Alamodome for a concert, Market Square, the Quarry and all the missions. This rental is very centrally located. Excellent location, friendly and welcoming hosts and upscale accommodations make this a must rent. Will stay here again, no question."

Bathroom water pressure is fantastic, 2 mini splits keep both rooms hot/cold, bed is not too firm, not too soft. The patio is a perfect spot for morning coffee and the surrounding trees invite lovely birdsong. We appreciated the welcome snacks/drinks and Taylor was a very helpful and responsive host.

The neighborhood is so beautiful with old trees and lush landscaping everywhere you turn . The shower wow!!! I didn’t want to get out. The bed was so comfortable not too soft and not too firm it was just right .
If you book this place and don’t want to cook, central market is a few minutes away you will be amazed by the amount of already made meals and different selections you never see at your neighborhood food stores . Great TV and movie Chanel’s and 1 remote easy to Navigate .
Ok just book this place the only regret you will have is not staying long enough.

Stayed a few nights","This was probably my favorite Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The location was perfect - I walked to delicious Mexican food and coffee shops during my stay, and downtown and the Pearl district was just a few minutes' drive. The house was immaculate and had so many nice details for guests. The bed was comfy, the fridge had drinks, and everything was so cute. My only regret is that I couldn't stay longer!"

They got all the details right… and so easy to check in and out. Taylor is wonderful… she responds to communication immediately but also left me to myself for privacy. One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had."

Her casita is beautiful, the attention to detail is impeccable, and Taylor truly makes it feel like a home away from home. In a very important and intense time in our lives, she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for. We couldn’t recommend her and the casita enough - a 12/10. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Roll out of the luxurious king-size bed, have a cup of coffee on the porch, take a stroll through the neighborhood, and grab a short Uber ride to explore downtown and historic areas of the beautiful city!
Taylor has tastefully created the feel of the city inside the casita, while also being conscious of utilizing eco-friendly materials for decor and lighting, as well as compostable coffee pods, and more.
My partner and I were so pleased with our stay, and look forward to visiting again, soon. Couldn't recommend more!"

No detail was too small as she prepared the casita. The house was comfortable, clean, and perfectly located. We loved getting to know Taylor and her whole family. This was truly the perfect Airbnb. As San Antonio residents, it was perfect for a staycation. It’s the perfect launching point for exploring the city! Taylor’s communication was great and quick & very responsive."

Stayed a few nights","The Marigold was one of the nicest and most thoughtfully put-together homes we've stayed in and I can't recommend it enough! Me and my husband stayed two nights with our toddler and it felt like such a vacation even though we were just coming from Austin. The home is quiet and peaceful and totally private, and every detail has been intentionally considered. We really enjoyed the higher-end materials (especially the mattress) and had everything we needed for meals in the kitchen. The design is creative and beautiful and incorporates a lot of San Antonio culture. Loved this place and will be back!"

The space was beautifully decorated and really gave us a good flavor of San Antonio—we loved all the local artists, books, and coffee our host featured.

Stayed one night","Our stay at the Marigold Casita was amazing!
We were blown away by the design of the casita. Every little detail was so fun, creative & perfect from the tortilla basket accent wall to the neon green refrigerator! The colorful decor just screamed San Antonio fiesta! The San Antonio themed amenities were also a great touch.
The location was great, as it is right in the middle of the city. It was a 5 minute drive to some of San Antonio’s best attractions- the Pearl, Doseum, Riverwalk and zoo! The walkability of the casita allowed us to visit the grocery, restaurants and parks without even getting in our car, and the neighborhood was absolutely beautiful.
Lastly, the place was incredibly simple and clean. The host provided sustainable cleaning supplies, which allowed us to easily keep it clean during our stay!
I can't wait to go back."
