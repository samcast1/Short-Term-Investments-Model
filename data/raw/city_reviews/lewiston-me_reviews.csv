I will say I had a question at 11pm, felt soooo bad for messaging that late but they responded very quickly and also told us that anytime if we needed anything to please message or call, which I really appreciated!!!
We will definitely stay again :) Thank you so much!!"

And to have the washer and dryer handy. I was very please during my short visit to my son in Maine. Very close to the campus, so I can visit with him everyday. And the private parking on the back, very helpful in that area. Thanks Danielle"

I packed light since I didn’t really know where this trip was going to take me so I’m glad I was able to do a quick load of laundry when I got there. The apartment was very clean and had everything I needed for my brief stay. Thank you again!

Stayed a few nights","I had a delightful stay, made especially memorable by the owner's warm hospitality and an irresistibly adorable little Westie named Meyer. The host was friendly, always ready to offer local tips or share stories, which really added a personal touch to the experience. Meyer, the Westie, was friendly and full of energy, a real cutie! The accommodations themselves were comfortable and well-maintained, making it easy to feel at home. This place is perfect for those who appreciate engaging conversations and a charming canine companion. Thank you again."

I highly recommend staying with her, if not just for the comfort, location, or great value then for the great conversation, ease of interaction, and amazing hospitality.

I felt supported at every turn, and even when a hurricane had the potential to disrupt my travels, Ani proactively reached out to communicate with me. Ani is an outstanding host and an amazing human being who was lovely to connect with. Her home is very peaceful and offered just what I needed for a short trip to Lewiston. Meyer, her cute dog, was another plus. I will definitely try to return to Ani’s charming home in the future."

I did miss the part where the room did not have AC. I stayed at the tail end of a nasty heat wave - it got pretty hot in the bedroom but cooled off nicely at night. There are a decent number of rules associated with the stay, but that’s understandable given it is Ani’s home. She is also very up front about them. I highly recommend staying here - it is a great value!"

She was helpful, kind, considerate and as detail oriented as anyone I’ve ever met.
Her home was new and immaculately kept!
Ani even helped me through a challenge with a flight cancellation and was able to arrange a bus ride to Boston that saved me an extra day of downtime and a lot of money!
Oh, and Meyer the dog, that’s another story. He just completed the unique experience.
If you’re looking for a place to stay with added personality, you won’t be disappointed!"

The rooms are immaculate and sanitized , and with just the right amount of space & warm natural lighting in the daytime . The open concept LR/kitchen is a welcome touch of efficiency.
Ani Jane was instrumental in helping me navigate the resources in the community , offering a masterful assessment of eateries and cultural highlights of the city . And if you are a dog lover , her Westhighland terrier , Meyer , will steal your heart .
This place is now on my shortlist of Airbnb’s . Thank you , Ani , for providing a delightful experience ."

When you stay at her house as an Airbnb guest, you leave as a friend. Her adventures and stories will inspire you and her recommendations on where to venture out to around Maine were perfect.

Stayed one night","Clean, accommodating, and communicative are a few of many words I would use to describe Ani Jane and her home. I’m so grateful I had a place to sleep during an ice storm that was close to my work. Ani Jane is very accommodating and leaves everything in order for you to have a comfortable stay. I forgot some toiletries but there are plenty in the private bathroom to save me. Her pup was such a highlight and he’s a great, playful, and quiet dog. Ani Jane is very covid conscious and takes great precautions to ensure both her and I were safe and it was very appreciated. The house was the perfect temperature but lots of extra linens in case I was cold were provided. I’m looking forward to rebooking with Ani Jane when I need a place to stay in Lewiston."

Stayed a few nights","I would like to mention, this was my first Airbnb experience. That said, I am used to staying in hotels so, I really didn’t know what to expect. What I got was way more than what I paid for! First off, my room and bathroom were immaculately clean and comfortable. Second, Ani Jane was wonderful. Her quirky genius I really appreciated and hanging out with her and her wonderful dog, Mey Er (yes, that is how it is spelled) was priceless. Okay, check this out… she not only drove me to town to get groceries but even (expertly I might add) helped me figure out my health insurance (I know that sounds weird but damn amazing). Seriously, the whole experience was like going to visit an old best friend that I hadn’t seen since high school. I needed a place to stay so I could visit my daughter who recently moved to a remote area close to there but feel like I gained a new friend… and a pup that I miss already!"

The host was incredibly friendly and helpful during our stay and hanging out with her dog, Mayer, made us feel at home. Our room was private, comfortable, and cozy! We spend some time in the living room hanging out with the host and another guest, but kept a busy schedule so we didn't get a chance to spend much time at the Airbnb. The host was more than willing to put on a movie or let us choose what was on the TV. She even made me tea!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed for 40 night's at Marcia's place. It is fully equipped for a long term stay. I was able to do zoom meetings with no problems. The neighborhood is very quiet, safe and walkable. Marcia was very quick to respond to the couple of requests I had. The only thing to be aware off is that there is a set of 13 indoor stairs leading from the porch to the main living area. They are fairly steep and with a short run. There are hand rails. These stairs could be a challenge carrying heavy luggage, or groceries or for anyone with mobility or vertigo symptoms. I enjoyed my time there and would not hesitate to stay again."

The first night we did take-out from Frank's and the food was very good. Overall, a very nice experience."

The bed is terrific, can’t remember when I slept so well outside of my own bed! I liked that the apartment isn’t crammed with furniture, it feels airy and spacious, with plenty of space for 4 on comfy sofa and armchair. Very quiet at night except for a neighbor’s dog who barks frantically every few hours, when they let him out. Just note that the place is on the 2nd floor with a steep staircase going up from the porch. Also, it might not be the best for some remote workers, as it’s in a dense neighborhood, with trucks passing by during the day and a diesel station next door. Either way, its a cozy place with wonderful hosts and close to many nature preserves worth a visit."

It was ideal for me since I was on a solocation and the small town of Lisbon was what i needed to rejuvenate my spirit. I met Ms. Marcia the day after checkin and she was so such a sweet lady. A big plus was the shower pressure was amazinnnngggg! Toiletries were provided (shower gel, sham/cond, tp) and towels. A full kitchen, a sitting area and a small dinette section made the stay comfortable. The mattress was ok but the sheets were clean and soft with comfy pillows. The only thing i wish was that in the bedroom there was curtains to block out the early sun rise that beamed through the blinds (so i was up super early due to that). Overall, my stay at Marcia's place was worth the drive. I would definitely rebook🤗"

For anyone who has some special needs, it should be noted that there is a steep flight of stairs when you enter the apartment. I am almost 7 months pregnant and had a 50 lb suitcase to lug up there. Not a problem but it would have been nice to know...

It was very spacious, cute design, and very clean! This Airbnb is within walking distance to breweries, restaurants, and parks. Aimee is friendly, thoughtful, replies quickly and overall a perfect host! I hope to come back and visit in the future. ❤️❤️"

Stayed one night","So cute! Will definitely stay here again, the view of the river was so pleasant in the evenings and I enjoyed morning walks in the area.
Aimee gave clear directions and instructions for entering, I had my own parking spot, brand new linens, and a basket of snacks and drinks for my stay! I teared up a little it was so thoughtful!!
The bathroom had recently been remodeled and the overall style was super cute and tidy.
There is a flight of stairs to walk up but is well lit. Wifi was fast and the bed was comfortable. I actually bought the exact pillow on line during my stay because it was the best sleep I’ve had in months!
Clean, comfortable, and affordable, I would definitely reccomend Aimee as a host and look forward to staying here again."

Stayed one night","Amie is/was a fantastic host. The apartment was absolutely spotless. I often look where most people forget to clean when I’m at a bnb, and I was thoroughly impressed to find that even the baseboards behind the bed were spic n span!
There are parks, convenience stores, restaurants and even bars within easy walking distance (about 3/4 mile) . Also, having a designated off street parking spot is a pretty big plus. The deck overlooking the river was great place to have a drink.
Amy was responsive to any questions I had, as well as personable. I would book Aimee’s bnb again any time"

Stayed with a pet","Before we arrived a small leak in the roof was found. Amie found a person to fix it and got up on the roof with them to ensure it was fixed. When we arrived she explained what had happened. Amie had me a birthday card, my Yorkie doggie treats and toy, a dish of candy . The bathroom and kitchen were stocked with items we might need. We had one problem with the TV's . David came up and had it fixed in a few minutes. He told us a little history of the house. It was built in the 1890's. I have always loved old houses and no one could ask for better hosts than Amie, David & Aylie."

Stayed with a pet","We had a great time staying here. They were so thoughtful and helpful whenever I was confused (and didn’t read the directions 😜) or there were issues with appliances. It’s an older home, but very well maintained. We were here for a family emergency and had to uproot our family and dogs for a month. They did everything to make us feel right at home.
The master bed is sooooo comfy! We actually took a photo of the tag so we could buy one when we get home 😁. There were lots of games for kids and toys/comforts for the dogs. They even had fresh water in the dog bowls when we arrived. The backyard was great for our big dogs.
We don’t have any complaints at all. It was more expensive than we were expecting, but in line with other places and they definitely had more to offer than other places (like the fenced in back yard and all the creature comforts of a home and not just a passing through house). Overall, we would definitely stay there again."

The beds are comfortable and there is a heat pump in each of the bedrooms and the living room for cooling and heating. When we got into town sooner than we had originally expected and asked whether we could check in earlier Jennifer responded right away and said of course we could. You should be aware that neither the water and ice dispenser on the refrigerator nor the dishwasher are hooked up yet. We spent a comfortable 5 days and appreciated the fact that Jennifer's house is close to many interesting and surrounding areas and really enjoyed our stay there!

Stayed with kids","Was extremely happy with our stay at Jennifer's place. Everything was just as listed. We felt at home there and especially appreciated that the kitchen was fully stocked with spices and some items were already there to start out like coffee. While we didn't need to use the ""take 1 leave 1"" cabinet, there have been times/trips when that would have been a big help and is a thoughtful touch. We loved the great selection of board games and multiple tv's that gave the grandchildren separate places to watch tv or game. The garage is a fun idea although when cold out, it is probably not usable. but would be in warmer weather. The beds were comfortable, loved having a washer/dryer onsite. This gave us much more space than we have had in hotels, even those with suites. Was nice to find plenty of body wash, shampoo and even lotions and items under the sink, even a first aid kit. We will definately plan to come back again. The planned updates will be a plus. Jennifer was very responsive."

However, this likely even exceeded the previous Airview. all the appliances and everything in the apartment is new and very, very very clean. Everything works. The entry system is secure and may be a little complicated if you are not computer literate and don’t know how to download apps on your phone.

This is a great property and is perfectly located for what I needed it for and there is plenty of parking to accommodate any type of guests. The kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed and then some and the bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. Danielle’s property was so perfect for my needs that I immediately booked it again for my next stay and will do so every time it’s available when I’m going to be in Lewiston! Highly highly recommend this property and it’s owner!"

Danielle was extremely communicative and accommodating. As others have said, you can hear noises from the business next door and traffic, but it quieted down by evening. If you’re sensitive to florescent ceiling lights, be mindful that they are the main light source throughout the place. There are table lamps in the living room and both bedrooms, so there are alternatives."

The building is on a busy street so street noise is significant in the living room.
Unfortunately, it snowed during our visit which resulted in our being woken up at 3:30 in the morning by the plow clearing the snow from the adjacent parking lot.
I don't mind cleaning dishes but a dishwasher would have been convenient.
If I come back to Lewiston I will see if these accommodations are available."

It is on a major road and close to the hospital, so you will hear road noise, but we didn’t find it bothersome at all. It was really a nice, clean spot and a great value. We were traveling with 4 young kids and a baby. It wasn’t baby proofed, but we knew that ahead of time & managed just fine. The mattresses were AWESOME! We felt like we were in our own bed at home. The only thing missing was some white noise to sleep by."

The place was barely a mile from the Auburn/Lewiston downtown area with its restaurants, parks, convenience stores and the Fianna tattoo studio (my main reason for traveling there!), beautifully decorated, extremely cozy and homey. They even had a working turntable with some cool records for our enjoyment. When I have to go back to that area in a couple of months, I will most certainly try to book it again!
I very strongly recommend it!

Stayed with kids",This spot was a nice find when we couldn’t find a single hotel room available for the weekend we could head north. We wanted to visit the area near St. Mary’s assisted living to be close to family and this was the perfect spot for our family of 4. We were there mostly on the weekend so we really didn’t even notice the businesses in the building until Monday morning and then we could hear some of the conversations around us. The place was really clean and felt safe. Really anything you would need is really close to this apartment and pretty much everything you’d need for a stay is there. The directions ywere short and straightforward and communication was quick and easy. Since family is so close this will hopefully be available for our future stays as well! My grandmother asked for the information to pass along to other family members who would like to stay close by!

Stayed with kids","Fantastic place for travel with kids and adults. We stayed here with our two children ages three and one, and my mother-in-law who has a bad knee. This apartment is on the ground floor of a multi use building, and the layout of the apartment speaks to its initial design as probably a medical or business office. However, the hosts have decorated and furnished it perfectly to accommodate guests of all ages. Three steps to get in, no other stairs. Parking right next to the door. Plenty of towels! Necessities, dishes, cookware all provided. Cute bakery right next-door with donuts and coffee. For guests who like a morning run, Bates College is just about 3/4 of a mile away. The street outside is pretty busy and sometimes loud (cars, not voices), but none of the bedrooms face that street so you don’t really notice except when you’re watching TV. Excellent AC units in each room."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at this comfortably and thoughtfully furnished apartment. Really, all you need is yourselves, clothes, and food. There are businesses in the building, but we were out visiting family and exploring Maine during business hours, so it didn't really affect our stay. If it's important to the prospective customer, this apartment doesn't have a bathtub, but it does have a removable shower head sprayer in a standing shower. The location was convenient to our needs (family near), and we used a nearby laundromat (within sight of the apartment). The apartment is decorated beautifully and is a functional blend of modern and antiques. Our hosts were available and helpful. Word of advice, ignore your GPS if it tries to take you behind the building--it lies. We would stay again!"

Bed was super comfortable, the dining/kitchen area has cute character. I wish I had been able to take advantage of the sauna built into the bathroom - what a cool perk! The backyard looked like a dream if you're the kind of person who likes to wake up slow and drink coffee outside before the day starts. Also loved seeing the little pumpkins growing in the backyard garden! Everything was super clean and Chris provided great details on check-in and different things to know for my stay.

Note that the sink is in another room that has wonderful laundry facilities - our guess is that this is due to how the plumbing needed to be routed. It really wasn’t an issue. If you are staying in the Lewiston/Auburn area, do not pass this one up!"

When I was ready to go to my appointment in the morning and headed to my car, the host had already cleared a perimeter around my car and was in the process of shoveling the driveway so I could get out.
The apartment was beautiful, comfortable, equipped and squeaky clean! I made use of the sauna one night and it was perfect!
If they agree to host me again in the future, I wouldn’t think twice before booking it again.

Chris and Justin had left a cute message on their magnetic Scrabble board to welcome us and my son found the Skittles vending machine and immediately proclaimed the place a hit! I loved the sauna after skiing and fell asleep immediately in the comfortable bed. The kitchen works well for short stays and light cooking and the laundry machines are top notch!

It has to be at the top of the list with respect to cleanliness and order of all of the places we've stayed over the years; it was immaculate. The instructions were so thorough and helpful. While the unit did have a separate entrance around behind the back of the house, it was most helpful to be able to access the unit from the shared entrance on the side. The snow had begun to melt, and the mud would have been messy to walk through, and we did not want to track any into the unit. We did enjoy using the sauna--a nice touch! The kitchen was perfectly stocked, and, although we didn't use it, the washer and dryer is a nice, added bonus. Justin was so helpful in getting Fox Sports downloaded for us on the TV, so we could watch the Super Bowl! Talk about going above and beyond...! Everything was perfect, and I hope I haven't forgotten to mention anything. Highly recommend and would stay again."

From the moment I messaged them about booking, until checkout, they were nothing but kind and more than accommodating. My partner and I were coming to the area for a wedding and needed to check in early, which they very graciously allowed. There were very thorough directions before check in with everything you’d need to know about the house. The house itself is beautiful and spotless. Perfectly decorated and has everything you could need. You can tell they’ve put so much thought and effort into making this into a home away from home. I wish that we had more time to stay, but will most definitely be back. Thank you so much for a perfect stay!"

We spent 8 nights here in June and we used it as a base sightseeing in the area and it was ideal for our needs. Maine is truly beautiful. Chris and Justin were such kind and thoughtful hosts not only while we stayed with them but also with some of the basic touches (like good quality coffee pods and teas) in the apartment which when you are travelling make life away from home much easier. Thank you again and if we are ever in the area again and you are still there we will certainly be booking with you.

This place is very tastefully decorated, and has a comfy bed with high end bedding. The sauna is accessed from the bathroom and is a great added feature. It has everything you need to cook except a kitchen sink. The sink is in the spacious laundry room next to the high end washer and dryer. It was fine for us, as we didn’t do a ton of cooking. I recommend that you don’t meal plan for anything like pasta that needs to go from the stove to the sink for draining. Overall it was a great stay and I would recommend it to others."

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic, quiet space for a lovely getaway. Chris really thought of everything to make this a comfortable and highly functional space. A couple of my favorites — a filtered water dispenser with hot and cold water for drinking, a Keurig with a generous plethora of coffees and teas from which to choose (with cream and sugar also provided), complimentary shampoo and conditioner in the shower, and bountiful closet space for all of your belongings. It was very quiet, and the private entrance to the space is a nice feature as well. The space is also located a mere 10 minutes from some lovely hiking at Androscoggin Riverside Trail and the East Coast Greenway."

The apartment was tucked away on a nice private street and inside it was sparkling clean, the kitchen and fridge were very convenient, the bedroom was comfortable and air conditioned, and although we didn’t end up using it, the private sauna was quite an impressive feature. Self check in was quick and easy and the stay was very enjoyable."

We were able to get some excellent, restful sleep in the tremendously comfortable beds. Additionally, the shower pressure was just right — always a plus! I loved spending my evenings lounging in the living room, reading a book, all wrapped up in one of the fluffy blankets that were provided.
Jana was also very welcoming in her messages, and super quick to help us resolve any issues we had getting in.

The fridge is huge and the kitchen easy to cook in. The kitchen table is fine for 4 and there is also the extra table outside which is super to enjoy and morning coffee or breakfast or a sunset meal.
The furnishings are very nice, new, and clean. The beds are very comfortable and the closets are nicely sized. The washer and dryer are near brand new and are in their own laundry room.

The home is lovely, and has every amenity. Jara is a gracious host who was kind, thoughtful, and responsive. We will definitely be recommending it to others, and plan to stay when we're back at Bates."

Stayed a few nights","This house was definitely one of the best experiences we have had with an Airbnb rental. Everything was very clean, organized, and explained. The kitchen was nicely stocked with anything we would have needed to cook there (we did not do that during our short stay), and the available coffee/tea options were outstanding. This place is very clean and Jara provided ample linens, towels, and toiletries. Lots of details that many other rentals miss make this a must-stay place if in the area. Thank you for such a wonderful, easy stay while dropping our daughter off for a workshop."

Stayed one night","Had a great, one-night stay at this place. The house is nice, the amenities plentiful, and the space smartly decorated. It was a bummer it was raining and we weren't able to take advantage of the deck.
My only critique would be the barrier to the upstairs. While I understand the owner's rightful and warranted separation of the upstairs, the barrier was some plastic thing that looked like bubble wrap and had a large sign stating an alarm would go off if it was opened. Not only was this a bit outputting, distracting from the otherwise super pleasant and welcoming vibe, but the top portion of it was open when we arrived and I was worried the rest of it would separate on it's own and wake us in the night so some shrill alarm. A simple, solid barrier over this precaution would be an easy fix, considering the amount of attention and detail put into the rest of the space.
But this was not a deal breaker, if I ever stay in Lewiston again I'd be sure to return."

This peaceful home is a 5 min easy walk to Bates athletic facilities, and quiet, clean, and ultra comfortable. We enjoyed cooking meals in the beautiful and very well equipped kitchen and the beds were very comfortable. We had an unexpected early March snow storm while we were there and Jara made sure we were shoveled out by the kind and helpful groundskeeper in time for my son to get to campus for morning practice - she could not have been more helpful!
Perfect place to enjoy a visit with my son and for him to get a little break from dorm/campus life. Highly recommend!"

Stayed about a week","It was very clean and a lot more modern than any other airbnb in Maine that i could find for this price range. Jara was very quick to respond about any questions. One thing i would say is odd was the 2nd floor was completely off limits, and was separated by a plastic see-through sheet which had a sign that said the alarm would sound if we went through it. It wasn’t clear if there would be people living up there during our stay, but after a few days of silence from upstairs we figured no one was there. There were lots of things to do around there, even in winter. We skied at a beginners area nearby for my boyfriends first time skiing. We visited Freeport for shopping which is not too far, and Portland was about 45 minutes but worth it for the food. One thing is that you weren’t allowed to change the thermostats in the bedrooms, the only one you could touch was the living room one, so it got cold at night sleeping. Other than that it had everything you needed and it was a great stay! :)"

It is also not a touristy place so you can avoid all the crazy summer traffic and people. We hiked in Apatite Park and a few other cool places. We also watched sunsets at the Auburn Reservoir, which was beautiful. The neighborhood was really cute and quiet. We took nightly walks around and it was really peaceful.

The plastic blocking the stairs to the second floor, with the sign to keep out or an alarm would sound, was a bit creepy but it seems that work is being done up there so it may not be an issue for the next guest. It was nice to be able to walk over to the Bates campus for both recreation and to leave our EV charging."

We came up to play disc golf in the area and it was centrally located for us to get to all the courses around. Jara was responsive and helpful with anything we needed. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks!!"

Stayed a few nights","PROS
PLACE - Hands down the best appointed AirBNB we've ever stayed in. Impeccably furnished, right down to the smallest detail w/ a nice comfy vibe to it. Came equipped w/ a nice kitchen complete w/ dishes, pots, silverware, etc.
HOST - Danielle was very responsive, professional, and accommodating. We live nearby, but had power knocked out during a windstorm. We had no idea when the power would come back on and when it did, we had already paid for the next night. Danielle graciously refunded our money, even though it was late into the day.
OVERALL:
5 stars for the place and the host. You may not find a nicer place in the Lewiston area near so much to do."

Stayed a few nights","My girlfriend and I decided to come up to Maine for a long weekend recently and came across Danielle's place while looking for somewhere to stay. We wanted to get to know the city of Portland and visit Acadia National Park, which were our main attractions. This was the first time I have used airbnb and to be honest at first, we were skeptical on what we would walk into. I'm happy to say we were completely taken aback by the cleanliness and comfort of the apartment when we first walked in. This was a very cozy place to stay in and it felt like it was our own, we had no problems arise during our visit but based on the communication we had with Danielle I am confident we would be in good hands. Danielle would also keep us updated on events coming up or recommend places to visit, for example a hot air balloon festival that happened to be around the area. Overall, our experience was great and helped us enjoy Maine on another level. Thanks again for having us :)"

I made a mistake while booking it and instead of booking it for two nights, I accidentally booked it for only one. Danielle and Cody were extremely understanding and allowed me to stay a second night, anyway. They contacted Airbnb and resolved my confusion, adding the extra night I needed.
If I need to go back to Lewiston, I will most certainly try to book it again (and will make sure I’ll pay more attention and book it for the right amount of time, next time 😃)
Thank you Danielle and Cody for not only being great hosts, but also good and understanding human beings and allow me to stay the extra night. Your kindness did not go unnoticed."

We lucked out in having less people than anticipated join for the visit, which actually worked out because although you could sleep 6 adults comfortably in beds, it would have been a tight fit with the space.
Something that is important to note, the house is very close to a hospital with an emergency department, making it quite loud in the evening with sirens. This is of course out of Danielle’s control, but something to keep in mind if you’re a light sleeper or used to more suburban areas!"

Their home is near a very large hospital so you may hear ambulance sirens. I didn't hear any, but it bothered my husband who slept in the room facing the main street (Sebattus Street)."

At night the noise was not a big issue. When we tried to nap one afternoon it was more of an issue. Otherwise it was a fantastic stay. Parking is adequate.

Stayed a few nights","Well appointed and inviting apartment in Lewiston. Lots of charm but with modern conveniences. Worked perfectly for the 4 of us for 2 nights while visiting the area. If there was one issue, it's just that the house is close to a very busy street and can be a bit noisy overnight as it's an older building. But the hosts wisely have ear plugs available right at the bedside and we all slept great in the comfortable beds."

Stayed one night","Dorm style accommodations with pleasing décor, convenient kitchen setup, and spacious bathroom. King mattress on the floor, wedged between two walls, was extremely soft, uncomfortably concaved, hard to climb in and out as you climb over the other person. Room so small, I could touch my feet to the opposite wall and there was no floor space for even small luggage. Queen beds were similarly very soft in a second, spacious bedroom. While location may be convenient to Bates, busy road noise should be expected. Lastly, I was unpleasantly surprised with directions to wash dishes, strip bedsheets and to start laundry before checking out, given that I had paid a cleaning fee with my reservation."

Lewiston is an affordable location, in the center of everything and the perfect launch pad for day tripping. From this home base we made daily excursions to: Portland, Bar Harbor, Bangor, Bailys Island, and Freeport. The apartment was perfect for hanging our hat and has all of the amenities, including a large washer and dryer - much appreciated. We even got to enjoy the kitchen every morning and a meal after enjoying the Saturday farmers market. The campus of Bates College, just a few blocks away, is a beautiful place for a morning walk. Enjoy!"

It is stylishly decorated, immaculately clean, and very cozy. The space heater was the star of the place for this Florida girl staying in Maine for the winter haha. Loved that there was a washer/dryer in unit and a smart TV. I loved how close Danielle's place was to work and to essential places like the grocery store. Danielle regularly reached out to me which was very comforting being so far from home. Without hesitation I would recommend Danielle's place to anyway staying in Lewiston."

If I had any need Danielle would respond immediately even though the need was minimal. I loved having a washing machine and dryer available.
