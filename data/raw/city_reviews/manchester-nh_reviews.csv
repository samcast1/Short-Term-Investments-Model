Stayed a few nights","Great stay! This was my second stay at the Factory. The room was nice and clean. The Boho theme is great! Please check the plants when you get to the room. They were a bit dry so I made sure to give them water. The best part of the room is how sunny it is! If you like lots of natural light this is a great room.
It’s not far from the airport and there is a lot to do around Manchester. I visit for work, but I like the convenience of shopping."

Stayed a few nights","this has been my favorite place thus far. I wish I could live there!! the artsy vibe is right up my alley and everything was A++++ and when I went to leave at 6:30 am and then realizing I had left my cell phone in the apt with the keys inside and a security door I managed to text Mariana (the host) from another device and thankfully she responded immediately and guided me through getting back in and up to the room to retrieve my phone. she was excellent and just all around amazing and friendly esp for that early in the am. I would have understood if she hadnt gotten right back to me but I was thrilled that she did. make my stressful mistake a breeze to get through so I could get on with my day. she's the perfect host. thank you Mariana, for everything I absolutely will be back as soon as possible. the bedding/ mattress/ pillows were an absolute dream to sleep on."

I didn’t realize that there was a place for garbage and we left ours tied up together. That was completely my fault, I missed it in the directions on where to dispose of it.
The place had a great vibe and we really enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Thank you to Mariana and the Factory on Willow team! This was definitely one of my favorite AirBnB locations I've ever stayed at. Even though this studio is located in a historic factory building, the windows and central air/heat worked perfectly to protect us from the cold 20-degree weather outside. We could not have possibly been more comfortable. Thank you again for a great stay and I look forward to booking here in the future when I visit again."

Stayed a few nights","Nice place to stay, on the smaller side, but it's comfortable. The only nitpicky things I would have are that there is not any extra bedding (other pillows or blankets) and weirdly no tissues. Only reason I noticed this is because I can get bad seasonal allergies. Also sad that, after asking an employee at the bottom floor, that the bean shop described, was apparently not there anymore? I could be wrong and I should have asked the host. Overall, nice location, a little loud, but I'm a heavy sleeper, so that didn't matter to me."

Stayed a few nights","Definitely experienced a ghost, that said the rest of the stay was wonderful. Very interesting key system for moving around the building. If you’re looking for a reason to come I would say the location is the best part of this room. It’s far enough from the city to where you can’t hear the traffic and close enough to get where you’re going comfortably. Old building and a nice comic shop on the ground level. Make sure to be respectful in the room however, you never know who’s watching 👀👻👻"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely Boho Retreat apartment in a unique setting, but some of the missing necessities made an impact. Basics such as an extra blanket and pillow, tissues, and a cutting knife would have made a nice difference. Some renters complained of noise from local businesses, but after a three nights, we found it quite peaceful. The entry keypad does not work well and we learned on our last day that the key fob opens the door! Communication about that, and where to take out garbage, would have been helpful. DO NOT forget to put parking pass in the car window! The building seemed deserted, the hallway had a strange smell, and there were no food trucks, but on the whole, we wanted a unique and peaceful location and that’s what we got."

Stayed a few nights","The Factory is an affordable and fun getaway for anybody coming to the area. There are aspects of the place that are so cool (original wood from shoe factory, a bookstore, and even an authentic phone booth). We did not take advantage of the events but there was live music and even a food truck. A millenials dream. Great value. Just be aware that you are next to a bright and decently loud area as a trucking company is across the street. I am a CDL driver myself so I have sympathy but it can get a bit loud. The darkening shades helped but just beware and plan accordingly. We had a blast!"

One thing to note is that there’s an auto body shop right outside the window and an exhaust shop down the road. The guys are up and working early and sometimes work late. The boho paradise was a very cute, clean place to stay."

Mariana was very helpful in communicating with us before we checked-in, and we felt that if we had any questions during our stay, we would get answers quickly. The space is very cute and cozy inside, and the Factory Apartment Complex that the apartment is located in is a very cool space as well. However, the surrounding area is very industrial, and the walks between the apartment and the downtown area are not the most scenic. The place itself is very bare-bones, but the natural light, plants, TV, and stovetop in the kitchen make it great for a weekend getaway."

It was a quiet space to relax, but easy to get downtown if you wanted more of that feel. My only worry is that when I come back to Manchester, they will be so popular, I won't get a room! This is a great place to stay for work, staycation, or a get away. I used it as my ""homebase"" to see other parts of NH (seacoast & white mountains) as day trips. Highly recommend it!"

Check in was a breeze, and Mariana graciously let us check in a couple of hours early. We loved the mattress, very comfortable for both of us, though we have very different preferences. The plants are such a nice touch. I recommend ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper, as walls between units are thin and there are lot of active birds in the morning. For the price I would definitely recommend and return."

The towels and bedding smelled suspiciously of febreze and not laundry detergent.
Otherwise, the location was good and with a proper cleaning, I think this would be a fantastic stay."

Group trip","I came to Manchester with a group of friends to run a race. Kevin’s house was perfectly located about a mile from the start/finish line of the race. While we could have gotten hotel rooms and stayed right at the race site, it would have been much more expensive let alone we could not have all fit in one room. The house was perfect with four bedrooms and two bathrooms + a couch that could also provide a place to sleep if we didn’t want to double up. The house is an older home in an established neighborhood with modern touches throughout. Some of the highlights: lots of thick, fluffy towels, soaps and shampoos; plenty of blankets (temps were cold, so much appreciated!); location…walkable to downtown; comfortable seating; working appliances (trust me…that isn’t always the case…); quiet neighborhood; and easy entry and checkout. My friends and I had a fabulous time and would absolutely recommend Kevin’s place! Thanks for your hospitality!"

Stayed with a pet","Really great home and host! Kevin was responsive and helpful with any questions. Kevin has the place well-stocked with everything you need for a long stay.
The home itself is in a great location. Everything is working as expected; there is hot water, heat, parking, fast wifi, full kitchen, and more! It was perfect for a long weekend getaway with our dog (who enjoyed the nice backyard) and working from home during the week. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The place is extremely clean and supplied. One of my friends said bring toilet paper, paper towels, bath towels, etc. Well she had to bring all that back. Kevin's house had rolls of paper towels, toilet paper, abundance of bath towels, lysol products, case of water etc. We were so surprised. Soon as I open the door I was wow this place is so clean. The beds are extremely comfortable too. We had events in Manchester and Bedford, and this house is in a great location to the 2 venues and Uber was always readily available no matter what time. I would definitely stay here again!!!!"

The neighborhood is nice & quiet. Cooking in the kitchen was great as well. The cabinet filled with spices was a welcomed surprise and made cooking so much easier. We loved the cleanliness and the coziness of the home. And the AC’s made sleeping very comfortable. Thank you! We hope to stay again in the future. Entry was very easy and Kevin was attentive and responsive. My Bichon Frise, Luna, enjoyed frolicking in the fenced-in backyard. Great stay!"

Group trip","Old house, but lots of great updates. More 'extras' than I would have thought would be in in Airbnb - towels, bottled waters, paper towels, tissues, new condiments in the fridge, ice in the freezer, etc. 3BR upstairs share the 1 BA. 1 BR main floor has it's own BA. Shower upstairs a tight squeeze, but doable short-term. DR area seats 6 - bar height chairs. Couch (pull-out) in LR/den comfy - small room, but ok. Messaged a couple times w/Kevin - very responsive. Suggested he add more furniture to MBR - he responded it was already on order. Seems very on top of things, & was helpful. Isn't as close to SNHU as I'd thought, but it wasn't really an issue. We drove & found parking ok. Overall, I'd recommend if traveling to Manchester."

Park with a playground is about 2 minutes away. Walmart is under 10 minutes away. Neighborhood is quiet in a good location. If you forget something, it is probably stocked in the house. Everything that we wanted in a house was there. I will definitely be staying again."

It’s slightly off the main drag of downtown, and you’ll need a car to get places, but it’s Manchester so you kind of need that anyway, and honestly I feel like that’s baked into the price. Also note that it’s a third-floor walk-up. Stairs are outside but well-covered so there was no issue with ice or anything. Parking is super easy. There’s a Dunkin across the street, and also a good pizza place. Nice and quiet. Well maintained. Black-out curtains in the bedroom. Personal touches when I got there. Highly recommend."

I’ve never seen a cleaner bathroom, and really appreciated the thoughtful gestures and amenities (first aid, extra toothbrushes, candy!, feminine products!!!). We have family in town and a lot of reason to visit Manchester, and I will not consider staying at another location or with a different host on our many subsequent visits!"

The location was close to so many restaurants, walkable to downtown, and close to major highways for our work commutes. Scott and Michelle provided great local recommendations and were always helpful and responsive. There was even a sample of local coffee and chocolates when we arrived! The bed was very comfortable and we really appreciated the desk for remote work, and other small touches for laundry and toiletries. Could not recommend this place enough! Great value, location and hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","Scott and Michelle are great hosts--very responsive and happy to share tips on things to do. This was a work trip so I didn't have much extra time, but I'm keeping their recommendations in mind for the next time I'm in the area. The apartment is just as described. It's very comfortable, clean, tastefully decorated, and has all the amenities you'll need. I even found a nice welcome card and a few treats when I arrived. The area is quiet and I really appreciated having an off-street parking spot. The heater was great and I never once felt cold despite the chilly nights outside. If you have mobility issues, you should see if they have another unit available. This apartment is on a third floor and requires climbing a couple of flights of stairs. But I had a great stay and would gladly stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","My fiancé, dog and I stayed at Scott & Michelle's adorable apartment for a month while visiting family in Manchester, NH. The apartment is decorated so nicely, it's super kid-friendly for those traveling with their little ones (child-proof drawers, games, kids bowls, etc), and there are so many helpful touches throughout the whole place. Upon entering the apartment, they left us a note with some local chocolates which was so sweet. There are also a ton of supplies in the kitchen, like spices, oil, coffee filters, etc and items in the bathroom that you might need as well. We worked from the apartment for the month and the wifi was great - no issues. You are also right next to Elm - so a quick drive or walk away from lots of food. Fratello's is a great Italian spot we loved! There is also a gym down the street and a Rite Aid next door. We would definitely stay again. Thank you Scott & Michelle!"

My first apartment AirBnB, and it was super quiet since it is a corner unit on the top floor. Portable A/C unit kept the apartment comfortable, even on the 90+ days. Well stocked kitchen, comfy couch, workspace with strong wifi, dedicated parking space. It was really nice to eat meals out on the covered porch/landing, sometimes chatting with a neighbor in passing."

There was a weird room in the back that wasn’t disclosed in the ad, computers set up with web cams. There was a sign that stated closed for storage??!! Ashleigh’s communication was great and she did refund for a second night that I was supposed to stay. I find it hard to believe this space is a guest favorite or 5 stars. My daughter and I felt very uncomfortable the very short time we were there."

The house was stylishly decorated, with cozy pillows, comfortable beds, and ceiling fans. The kitchen had everything we needed and more.
This was one of the most well-equipped Airbnbs we have ever stayed in, both in America and abroad. There were plenty of fluffy towels, cleaning products, bin bags, toilet roll, and paper towels. We were so glad we didn't have to rush to the store as soon as we got there!
We were also touched by the thoughtful gesture of Ashleigh and Rob, who set up a Christmas tree and some festive decorations for our kids to enjoy on Christmas morning and throughout our stay.
The communication with the hosts was excellent. They were always quick to respond and very friendly. We would love to stay here again and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful place to stay in Manchester."

Stayed a few nights","I recently stayed at Kevin's apartment in Manchester, NH, and it was an absolute delight. The apartment is not only cozy and super clean but also peacefully situated in the heart of the city. Kevin provided clear instructions that made our stay seamless and stress-free.
What set this place apart was the beautiful art and cultural decorations, which highlighted the Netherlands, including orange motifs of Holland, reflecting Kevin's love for Ajax soccer team. This unique touch added a lot of character to the space and made our stay even more special.
Whether you’re in town for business or pleasure, Kevin’s apartment provides a perfect, centrally-located retreat. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy a bit of culture in the comfort of a welcoming home.
Thank you, Kevin, for such a memorable experience!"

It's not a new home, so there is a bit of creakiness here and there, but that's part of the old charm of this pleasantly quiet neighborhood.

There was salt and a shovel left for us on the stair landing. The apartment was lovely; it's exactly what we wanted. The kitchen was outfitted beyond my wildest expectations! There were muffin tins should I want to bake! There was an extensive spice rack and a beautiful knife set! One thing that impressed us very much was the presence of a large recycling bin right in the kitchen. The main bedroom and the living room had giant TV's! The outdoor area was lovely, too.

We felt welcome here.
The cleanliness was impeccable EVERYWHERE! The attic space was perfect for our kids 💛 The beds were comfortable. Little things were left in the bathroom (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, toothpaste etc...)
The host was quick to respond and made sure we were settled in and recommended some places to visit! Basically, it was our best experience! I would highly recommend it"

We’d be lucky to visit again the next time we touch down in NE.

Then in the bathroom left a basket with toiletries as well as feminine hygiene products. It was really nice since we had to toss a few items at airport security. One evening we came back to find that the TV not working and I messaged Scott and he responded right away. I had turned off the outlet at a light switch an easy fix. They also provided a list of local restaurants and establishments that they enjoy as locals. It’s a convenient location to the SNHU arena in case you are traveling for a graduation. It’s close enough to visit all 6 New England states on day trips. A great experience and would definitely stay here again."

We booked this location and it was perfect, it was so local to family a few blocks away, graduation was close, nice area and walkable.
The layout was great and even had some things stocked you wouldn’t typically come across in airbnbs.
We couldn’t locate the key to get in and Amy replied immediately with assistance.
We would defiantly rebook here again."

The perks were the cute decor and tea/coffee/cocoa amenities. I highly recommend this place. We loved it!

Stayed a few nights",The description is NOT accurate. The claim is it is 2 bedrooms. BUT IT IS ACTUALLY 3 BEDROOMS. This is a wonderful place to stay for a weekend or a month. I will be back to stay here again. Amy has very keen decorating skills and appoints her spaces with flair and I would say a loving touch. This is a comfortable place to stay.

It is important to know that the bathtub is a beautiful old fashion claw type tub with high sides making it very difficult for an elderly or disabled person to get in it. also, there is a total of 15 fairly steep stairs to climb - also very difficult for the elderly or disabled. This should be noted in description of apartment when looking on line. However, overall it was a cozy, delightful place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and very pretty and safe."

Amy’s place offered us each our own bedroom (far enough away from each other for privacy and no disruption), a great common space and kitchen- Perfect for making coffee and tea and munchies when we were back from class.
The bathroom was fully stocked with everything needed which worked well as my friend traveled from around the world to school.
In the cold month of January the space was perfectly toasty.

Stayed a few nights","This place is quite charming and cozy, and Amy was a gracious host. We would absolutely stay here again! Adorable coffee and tea station in the kitchen, travel map with pushpins, and soothing, chic decor made this space feel welcoming. Never heard the tent downstairs, but know that the high school (and its marching band) are a building away if you plan to sleep in. Otherwise, location is entirely safe and near TONS of good food and small markets. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Amy's home is absolutely beautiful with great amenities. All I had to do is unpack and relax! This is the perfect home to stay in for several days. The bathroom was my favorite place to relax in a nice hot bath while reading a book or listening to music. The finished touches and bathroom amenities were perfect! The rooms are very large and there was plenty of space for a group. If you get chilly at night, the central heating works great throughout the house. The neighborhood was very quiet and the home was easy to access with parking on the street. There is a large porch in the front of the house with beautiful flowers. If I needed something, Amy responded quickly to my requests. I have no doubt that Amy's home will continue to be a top choice for tourists visiting New Hampshire and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"

Stayed with kids","Amy's apartment was the perfect home base for my recent business trip to Manchester. I was accompanied by my Mother who cared for my 2 yr old son, and the place was ideal for us. It was a 20-25 minute walk downtown for me, and a 5 minute walk to a nice playground for them. The apartment was clean, very comfortable, and every detail was considered by Amy. So much better than staying in a hotel for us but just as luxurious! Thank you Amy!"

The apartment was perfectly clean and in a nice & calm neighborhood.

A lot to do in the area, including lots of great alternatives for food, within a very convenient distance (my family kidded that everything was “nine minutes away”). We look forward to our next opportunity to stay here, hopefully in warmer weather, to use the kayaks and outdoor kitchen."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb is adorable and was extremely clean. This building had great security because there are definitely a couple areas very near by in Manchester that are a little concerning. A couple small things to note were the Netflix didn’t work for some reason. The tv kept logging us out when we would start to watch something. We tried to unplug the tv, restart it, and nothing really worked. There was also a dog fiercely barking and howling for several hours in distress upon our arrival in the air bnb next to us. I LOVE animals and I have two dogs myself that I did not bring with me & I think it’s great this place was pet friendly but just something to note. Several hours later I think the owners came back or checked out cause we didn’t hear anything when we came home from dinner. Overall a good stay & it was adorable and very clean. Mariana was responsive about those two issues even though no solution was really offered for them. It was a short two night stay for us. So not a huge deal."

A little dog hair on the throw blanket at the end of the bed- no big deal. Overall, cleanliness exceeded my expectations for a pet friendly space. Honestly, better than most hotels I’ve visited.
You can hear your neighbors and may get some minimal hallway traffic, but generally, everyone is very quiet! We rested well there. I appreciated that the Factory is so near by restaurants and things but just far enough away to be tranquil. Easy in/out and an elevator if you have mobility challenges. Parking lot may be full at times, but there’s extra spaces on the street.
Marianna’s instructions were friendly, thorough and easy to follow.
I’m greatly appreciative of spaces like this that allow me to bring my elder bunny on trips. Other airbnbs rejected us, even knowing he doesn’t come out of his cage. Thank you so much!"

The room was exactly as listed and being my first ever airbnb I was able to figure out the checkin process easily. Was excited to learn they are so pet friendly that there's even a mini dog park/walk on property which my dogs absolutely loved. This is definitely going to be a go to when in the area in the future.

Stayed a few nights","Goal of my trip was to get to the coast and the mountains and we had half marathon race in Newmarket NH during fall foilage and wasn’t sure if coast would have much so we chose Manchester which was easy access to all and still have safe, fun, and pet friendly environment. Everyone in bldg was super nice and it was quiet which was important to me. we did hear upstairs moving around but the elevators are not near any rooms and walls for side neighbors we couldn’t hear anything. had great restaurants near us and show at the arena that would’ve been fun to attend. had plenty of space and was very cozy and everything we needed for kitchen (just note no freezer). I read past notes to bring hard knife cutting board etc . Shower was fully loaded with shampoo conditioner and soap but you will need to bring hair dryer , bar soap .. maybe a dish towel . I have already told my friends about this awesome refurbished bldg that was industrial /mountain decor (totally my style ) and highly recommend it . I will definitely be back again.
*If it’s more than two people there isn’t anywhere to lounge outside of the bed. Had a two seater breakfast bar that was great for take out dinner that we did . It does have one small chair (I would recommend few more chairs for when people want to have reading or lounging outside of 2 people. But for us and our dog it was perfect)."

The internet is stable and fast, the laundry facilities efficient and easy to use. Mariana is such a wonderful host! I cannot imaging anything better at this price level, or even at a higher priced place -- other than probably more bedrooms. For two people traveling with their pets, this place is unbeatable!"

The team, was able to make a home away from home, in which is priceless for any guest's short or long-term stay. They genuinely want to make sure you have a terrific stay and will do anything reasonable to ensure it (under the agreement terms). Loved it."

Stayed about a week","My husband and I enjoyed staying here with our rabbit for 10 nights. It’s a great location close to restaurants and stores. It’s spacious, the sink is a little small and we bought a dish rack from the dollar store to dry the dishes. Small fridge, no freezer.
The food trucks were as others have said. You must try the food! It was a quiet building, walls are a little thin and you can hear the next door neighbor. Building security is great with the key fob.
There is a laundry room in the basement that takes quarters or you can use the app. No machine for detergent or dryer sheets. We bought detergent at the grocery store.
Overall we recommend staying at this Airbnb!"

There were plenty of green spaces and a dedicated fenced dog park. A gourmet food truck and Vegan pop-up were available next to the building. The apartment residents and hotel quests were all very friendly.
The room was spacious and sunny. The hardwood and tile floors were perfect for our 2 Shar Peis and the kitchenette facilitated their food prep. The heat/ac, instant hot water, and large screen TV with many streaming option added to the experience.
We consider our stay as an excellent value. Our Manchester family and friends are sure to recommend the Factory on Willow!"

It is spare and modern in keeping with the current style, has simple amenities and apparently a coffee stand and food truck patio is in the works. It's about three blocks from the south end of the bars and restaurants along Elm St. Mariana's communication was great.

I considered giving 4 stars because the Factory is not really ok for an extended stay. There is no freezer in the small fridge unit, no sharp knife nor cutting board, no dish rack and a tiny sink."

Despite being very close to bustling downtown, there is minimal noise and we feel very safe and private each visit. For anyone considering working while visiting: there is also a great island area or desk for meetings with great WiFi. Cannot recommend this for business or leisure high enough!"

Stayed a few nights","The condo ""1840's Gem w/ Modern Lavish Spin"" was great. The place was clean and tidy. The kitchen was clean and spacious and had everything you needed. The TV area's furniture was comfy, and the TV had all the of the streaming-TV services available that you would want. The upstairs loft bedroom was cute and cozy. The bed was awesome. The place is downtown, but parking was conveniently located right across the street. The bathroom was clean and all amenities were provided.
You are able to walk to many sites and restaurants from the property location. The Strange Brew Pub is less than a block away and is great place to hang out and watch live music. Another great place is The Cat Alley and Cat Alley Cafe, which are both about a block away directly east on Dean Ave. Cat Alley has murals of cats by local artists, and Cat Alley Cafe is a cute book store with coffee and muffins. You can go down to the river where there sidewalk and stop in at restaurants and cafes along the way."

They communicated regularly, answered a question I sent about check-in at 6:30 am in about 5 min (like I said, above and beyond!), and were super helpful. When another guest had taken the parking pass home, Tyler and Lodgism team were communicative and helped figure things out with an easy-going and helpful attitude. Super-host for sure, they should get 6 stars!"

Stayed a few nights","When we first arrived we were concerned that it would be too noisy for us to sleep because of how close several other houses were to James' house. We live on 80 acres in a rural setting. But other than a short stint of dogs barking, we slept like logs. It seems to be a quiet neighborhood.
The studio was smaller than I expected, but once we got settled, we had enough room for our things and us as long as we kept the dishes washed and the counters neat.
The bed is very comfortable, with a thick pillow-top mattress and a warm duvet.
The room was neat and clean with plenty of shower and bathroom supplies. There are dishes, glasses, coffee mugs, silverware, coffee, tea, electric tea pot, French press, microwave, sink, dish soap, sponge, etc.
Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay.
If you have trouble climbing stairs though, choose somewhere else to stay.
Thanks, James and Shoushan!"

Stayed one night","I recently stayed at this charming studio for one night, and overall, it was a pleasant experience that matched the homeowner's description.
The studio's heater is a real gem, especially during the winter chill. It keeps you warm and toasty, creating a cozy atmosphere. Parking was a breeze; there's a designated spot on the street, making it convenient for guests.
While the space was generally quiet, there were some noticeable sounds from the clock and pipes. It wasn't a major issue for me, but it's worth mentioning for those who are sensitive to noise.
The studio itself is well-maintained and exactly as described. It's a great spot for single or couple travelers looking for a comfortable place to stay. I appreciated the attention to detail in the amenities provided.
In conclusion, my overall experience was positive, and I would recommend this studio to fellow travelers. The host was responsive and the space had a warm and inviting vibe.
Thanks for a lovely stay!

Both James and Shushan were responsive and friendly hosts and I had everything I needed. I loved that there was ample street parking, too!"

James was a fantastic host, and was even able to accommodate an early check in. We’ll definitely be booking here again!"

Stayed one night","James's place was simple and sweet - just what we needed for a quick one night stay. The room matched the listing and all the necessities were provided. Not everyone has the same preferences for beds but it's helpful to know that this one is very squeaky and bouncy, so it's not the best for couples if one is a light sleeper. Also, the AC is a window unit which makes some pretty wacky noises (as most do), and it's very close to the bed, so be aware of that if you're sensitive to sounds while sleeping. When the unit is off, there is road noise, so you have to choose between the two. Another thing to point out is that this place is indeed very small. If you like to spread out and have some personal space away from your travel partner, this is not the place for you.
Bottom line, if I needed a place to stay for a few days or an extended duration, I personally would seek out a different place than James's. But for a single night, it was just dandy!"

Literally springs popping every time you moved. Very uncomfortable. Also, the bathroom sink is actually a kitchen sink in the bedroom. Definitely not worth the price considering my stepson & his wife rented a very cute cottage with all the amenities for less money just around the corner."

Stayed one night",This is the perfect spot for an overnight in Manchester or a 2-3 day stay if you plan to be out and about (and like your traveling partner). It’s a cozy space but very comfortable and welcoming. And comfortable enough if you’re stuck inside due to inclement weather!

The bed is comfortable and the shower pressure is phenomenal. We were able to come and go with no issues. There is plenty of on street parking. The unit was very clean and I personally loved the soft carpet in the studio.

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I stayed at the Spruce Studio for a couple nights and this was our first air b&b so we didn't know what to expect. But everything went great 5 stars for sure! We loved the secured building. Check in and out went smooth with clear instructions on what to do. The studio was clean, cozy, and tidy. The private bathroom was a plus! The shower was on the smaller side but did us good with great water pressure. The only thing was the dog next door barking every time we walked in or out, but it's not their fault and to be honest it didn't really brother us. The bed was compfy, there are no dressers but the closet was big enough for our bags and clothes. All around a great experience for our very first air b&b!"

I thought the french press and kettle, plus sugar and creme were just such a thoughtful touch (get that Keurig out of here!!). From the plethora of soap, to the wireless charging lamp/nightstands to the Roku and extra table in the closet...it was like the swiss army knife of Airbnb's, we loved it! We loved everything. The bed sleeps so well and the skylights just make you really feel like you're on vacation. The host gave so much consideration to the details so each guest could have a very comfortable stay. There is even a check in and check out PDF, a host after my own heart. We are totally coming back, even if just to stay in the BnB, it was just that good. Great value too!"

I brought my favorite coffee kerrig pod after reading that there was a machine available. I was warm and comfortable. The big TV screen was nice for unwinding after my long flight and it is smart to get out of Boston proper to avoid the traffic in the morning. Leonardo even messaged me that I’d left the dome light on in my rental car. Very thoughtful and attentive.

Leonardo, let me know immediately that there were Internet issues, and the issues were resolved quickly.
I wouldn’t hesitate to come back here again!"

Stayed about a week","I want to say that this private suite was super charming, clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and is in a very convenient area. It's only 10 minutes from the Manchester airport and only about an hour away from amazing trip destinations in Maine and Mass. Though, my mom and I did have a few issues during our stay, which is unfortunately why I can't give it a perfect rating. First, this suite is perfect for staying in Manchester for a night or two. My mom and I stayed for a week. During our stay, we ran out of toilet paper, and had to buy our own supplies, like coffee, sugar, cream, paper towels, plates, cups, and spoons, which should be readily available or resupplied. I would have asked the host about it, but I don't think he physically looks after the property or lives there. Also, it's an old house, so the walls are thin. The noise from cars on the street echoed and when it rained, a loud dripping sound made it tough to sleep. Again, it's a great little suite for a couple nights in Man."

Stayed one night","I loved the quaint suite I stayed at with my boyfriend this past weekend. It was a bit chilly when we came in, and no way to access temperature, luckily after a few minutes the heat did kick on. Although we were only staying for 20 hours, I would have expected to see a back up roll of toilet paper, but we ran out of the roll we had and had to make do with what we personally had on us. Exactly as beautiful as pictured, very clean and cozy & would definitely recommend for a place to stay while in Manchester. I hope this review is constructive and I really had such simple communications with Leonardo, thanks for welcoming us into your home."

Stayed one night","Leonardo and Adriana were great hosts. Their communication was clear, professional, and friendly, and they were very responsive if I had any questions.
Twice a year, I drive from Boston and stay overnight in Manchester because I sing in late Saturday holiday Masses at a local cathedral. Leonardo and Adriana were flexible about my return time after the Easter Vigil Mass.
The space had everything I needed for a brief overnight stay: a comfortable bed with a memory foam mattress and soft bed linens, lots of natural light from the windows and solid curtains for privacy, a cute foyer with a stocked coffee bar, fridge, and microwave, and a gorgeous and spacious bathroom with a well-appointed walk-in shower.
The red door and parking space out front made their house easy to find and access. The space is directly connected to the house but completely private. It is the ideal size for a traveler who is looking for a comfortable place to land. I would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed one night","PROS**
• This place was spotless, very clean and modern.
• The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is large and spacious.
• Though we didn't use the coffee bar, there was one present with to go coffee cups, coffee, tea, etc.
• The host was super accommodating when we requested early checkin due to a family wedding.
• Communication was always prompt with the exception of a little hiccup getting the key code which was resolved.
CONS**
• Busy road so lots of traffic all night - bring ear plugs.
• This space is attached to a main living space (I'm guessing) so conversations can be heard through the wall.
• TV reception and picture isn't the best but not a deal breaker.
• We stayed overnight due to a family wedding so we would've loved to sleep until 9 since checkout was at 10. At 7:45 AM we were awaken by loud male voices talking and laughing followed by power sanding and nails being banged into the wall :{ This is the only reason for the 4 star review."

It’s so convenient that the parking spot is right in front of the entrance door. It made coming and going a breeze and was especially helpful when bringing in luggage.
The room itself was incredibly quiet and peaceful which made for a great night’s sleep on the comfortable bed. Thank you, Leonardo, for being such a wonderful host and for making my stay so memorable."

The bedroom was tiny, with only room for the bed and a thin desk table and two cafeteria style chairs. Nice big TV, fast internet. The bed was a queen sized memory foam mattress. We slept great. The only downside (my own fault for not checking) was the lack of room for comfy chairs for hanging out in. If you need a bed and bathroom and only intend on clocking an hour or two awake, this is your Airbnb. (or you really like TV in bed)"

Stayed one night","A very cute place, and SUPER close the airport, which is a huge bonus!
* I LOVED the shower, so much. I wish I could've taken it with me.
* The shutter doors in the bathroom didn't stay closed, so I had to drape the blinds over them. Not terribly a fun thought that you have to have a wonky system to prevent people outside seeing you doing a number 2.
* The bed sheets were very, very thin. I didn't get cold, but... if you like thick sheets, these sheets they are not.
* The rooms may be few, but they are all VERY styling and functional. Had few to no problems with them.
I'd recommend this place in a pinch, but not for long and cozy stays."

Stayed one night",The airbnb was as described and very clean. The location was very convenient as it was only 10 min from the Boston Express bus stop and 10 min from the MHT Airport. Leonardo was great at responding very quickly and giving instructions.

Stayed one night","***PLEASE READ***
Leonardo & Adriana's cozy, comfy suite was Absolutely, Spotlessly, Clean and expertly designed, complete with beautiful wood flooring and exquisite architectural crown and floor moldings throughout, as well as neat, convenient touches of built-in outlets/USB ports in the bedroom's desk and nightstand, along with bedroom flat-screen TV and hallway fridge and coffee-maker.
The Ultra-modern! bathroom was equally nice, with its attractive and intricately tiled floor, and oh-so-cool shower (with slate floor and seat) giving it a great, earthy vibe. The comfy bed provided an extremely restful sleep. The private entrance, right-outside-door parking, and the digital lock for easy check-in/check-out, were all sooo convenient. If you stay with them, we know you'll also be saying, ""Leonardo and Adriana, thanks again for a wonderful stay!!"""

Stayed a few nights","We really liked our stay! It’s very convenient to the airport, local highways for exploring, and in a cute, quiet neighborhood. The parking pad was great for our rental car.
The only hiccup was the bed frame. It’s industrial style, made out of metal and wood, and extends past the mattress on the sides. It has really sharp corners on the footboard. Because it’s a tight space, I kept knocking myself on it to the point that after a 3-night stay I have bruises on my knees."

Great for 2 for a short stay. Private parking, easy to find at night. Basic kitchenette was enough for a 2-day stay."

Stayed one night","This place is as advertised. Loved the small details of the house - from the map in the bedroom to the wall art! The bathroom is beautiful and well lit. The shower and bedroom is also very clean. Communication with the host was fast and check in was simple and easy. Really appreciated the water and Leonardo's suggestions for places to eat in the area. A very nice place if you need somewhere to stay for a night or two, especially after a long day. There is no oven so you can't cook but there is a mini fridge to store your food. Overall, great stay and would highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Perfect stay at this lovely property. The photos from outside do not do it justice as there are pretty flowers in bloom when we stayed, it's a really pretty property. As you enter the property there are a few steps, the hallways is where you have coffee making facilities, fridge, water etc. to the right is the beautiful bathroom and to the left the bedroom. We only stayed for one night as a stop over and it was wonderful and had everything we needed. If we were in the area again we would definitely consider staying here again. Thank you 😊"
