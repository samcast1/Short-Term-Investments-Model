Offered us a late check out at a very minimal charge, knowing that we arrived very late and had to dress and be fresh the next day for a wedding. Staying at Micah's was refreshing.

Stayed a few nights","I booked the friends suite for my daughter’s 15th birthday weekend. She was wanting to go ice-skating and we had found the outside arena in Gadsden. I told her to look on Airbnb and see what she could find. She found this Airbnb so I went ahead and booked. The day we left for our fun weekend, her friend tested positive for the flu, so that kind of made the trip a little not so fun at first.
When we got to the apartment it was everything and more than what I saw in the pictures! We enjoyed it and everything we needed was within 5 miles! We are booking again! I HIGHLY recommend it."

Group trip","My sister was getting married the weekend of our stay and we were looking for a great place with a convenient location. This Airbnb is across the street from my sisters wedding venue (the pitman theatre). We thought this specific Airbnb would be perfect because it’s also friends themed. Who doesn’t love the friends tv show? Am I right?! We walked in that Thursday afternoon and were shocked at how gorgeous and clean this loft is. The high ceilings and giants windows in the bedrooms were everything! My sisters wedding photographer got the most breathtaking wedding photos standing in front of the tall windows. The friends theme was executed perfectly and they provided us with makeup wipes,laundry detergent and dishwashing detergent which was so helpful. Micah was very helpful and proactive with answering any questions that I had. I can’t wait to book another Airbnb stay with Micah again. My husband and I are already planning. Our stay was pure bliss. Thanks, Micah!!"

Lynn and Sandra were very accommodating and had a binder clearly laying out everything from using the wifi to local recommendations. The place had everything you may need including snack for both humans and dogs. I had 3 dogs with me and they provided access to the entire large backyard. I will be doing this same trip again in the future and I'll be looking to stay at the same place again.

If you forgot any toiletry, an extra was there. Keurig coffee with various selections, plus tea. Chilled water and a tray of fun snacks, too. Sitting area spacious with comfortable chairs and bed, too. Large grassy fenced area for our dog to really stretch her legs. It’s a lovely rural setting, 10-12 minutes to an Ingles so not far at all. Very clear instructions for everything. Great outside lighting and delightful entry in the garage, welcoming guests as they check-in. We will definitely come again as our mid-way stop on way to NOLA. Thank you, Sandra, for sharing your beautiful home with us!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay at Sandra's. The coffee bar and snacks were both great touches, and we enjoyed having them. I was impressed to find decaf and other non-coffee options too. That was great. Her home is on a quiet street that makes an excellent dog walk, but it is also right next to a highway that enables easy access to the hiking trails and nature that we were there to visit.
Her book of recommendations was great - we had a wonderful meal at Harp and Clover.
Everything was clean. Sandra was incredibly accommodating and helpful. We travel with frozen dog food, and she allowed us to store it in her personal freezer. The garage was also nice because of the wind and cold weather.
Honestly, I can't say enough good things. Perhaps, a counter-height surface near the bathroom/kitchen area would have been helpful since we brought food and prepped with the microwave, but that was just a tiny thing. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed about a week","Sandra and her family are the epitome of Southern Hospitality! The place was above and beyond what my husband and I expected! Sandra was always quick to respond and help out whenever needed!
-Things outside the space-
You're close to restaurants (highly recommend Coosa Cafe) and not far from Cherokee Rock Village nor Noccalula Falls. You should go to the Rock Village to watch the sunset, but also to explore. The Christmas Lights at Noccalula Falls are far superior to Winterfest in Pigeon Forge. Tickets are $10 during the week and it includes a train ride and petting zoo. And if you enjoy caverns, you should check out Cathedral Caverns, it's an hour away, but worth it and affordable! Desoto Falls and Indian Falls were cool! We rolled in a little too late to be able to explore the other areas. Cheaha State Park, Bald Rock, and Rock Garden Trail were neat! If we ever come back to Alabama, we are definitely staying with Sandra again!"

I came in late November and they had put up some Christmas decorations which was so nice and made me feel right at home. I am absolutely saving this place and rebooking if Im in the area again!"

The host makes you feel right at home and even offers you a spot to park in their garage. This host takes southern hospitality to a whole new level. There were snacks, waters, and several different types of coffee and cream. Also, extra toothbrushes and things that you wouldn’t expect to be there for you at an Airbnb. if I’m ever in the area again, I will for sure stay here."

The room was immaculare, private over the garage, and stocked with coffee, tea, water, hot chocolate, apple cider, many different snacks, a basket of toiletries with anything you might need, phone charger, and even dog treats. We were able to let our dogs stretch out and roam the large fenced yard (and do some zoomies!). We chatted with Sandra while out walking our pups and she is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Bed was comfortable, room temp was perfect and had fridge, microwave, and tv. The retractable gate at the top of the stairs was a nice touch to keep our dogs in! Sandra really has throught of everything! We wished we could have stayed on another night because it was so relaxing and the binder she provided in the room showed some really great places in the area! Hope to return!"

What made the stay so pleasurable was the extra details. We arrived late (midnight) and the garage door was open and ready for us to pull in and park. We easily followed the directions for check in and made ourselves at home. There was a basket in the bathroom for items possibly forgotten, a snack basket, a cpap machine table, seasonal coffee cups, creamers, and a notebook with info. These extra details really made the place feel like home and safe."

She had so many cute little ""things"" that just made our stay even more perfect. I'm pretty sure she thought of everything! She had snacks and water set out for us and even had little treats for our pup!
Sandra's place was small but very comfortable. Perfect for a couple or a very small family! And the price was unbeatable.
The location was also very nice. Quiet country (we even saw deer), and we felt safe the whole time. I loved that she even had a binder with things to check out, including places to eat. Highly recommend Decks and Docks!
Will definitely stay here again when in the area."

What a great surprise for us after driving 11 hours on our trip! She met us at the door and showed us to our room which was one of the best we’ve ever stayed in.

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay at Brian & Zinta's place. We shared the home with my sister-in-law and brother-in-law. We chose the home for the location and handicap access for a small family get-together. There was plenty of room so we weren't on top of each other, and during the family barbecue the kids had the fenced backyard as well as the kids room with bunk beds and a TV to hang out in. It was a perfect hub for all our family to come visit. With a daughter with a new baby and a relative that is ill we wanted someplace for family to be able to come to and visit without feeling any stress that they had to host us. We wanted to make our visit as stress free for them during some difficult times as possible."

On top of being within minutes from lots restaurants and activities it seriously makes you feel right at home. Completely squeaky clean inside and out. Looks to be newly renovated, and even had holiday decorations to fit the time of year that makes it that much cozier. I can’t say enough good things about this place and the host that rent it. Absolutely wonderful experience, host made sure at all times we had everything we needed for our stay and went out of her way to make sure my group and I were completely set.

Super clean and had all amenities one could want. I cannot forget the stars!

The house is super cute inside, has a huge fenced back yard, washer/dryer, 2 full baths and for those that need it, it’s handicap friendly. Zinta was able to cater our check in/out times and responded super fast if I needed something. We’ll definitely be back when we need a home away from home!!"

The beds are very comfortable and the kids room was well equipped with books and games and plenty of room to spare. The highlight for us was the beautiful creek at the bottom of the vineyard. We wish we spent more time exploring on the property. The owners invited us to come and enjoy live music at the event venue and my mom had a blast talking to lots of friendly people that came for the show.
I can not stress how amazing it was to be in a huge comfortable house that was less than 1 mile from the beautiful Noccalula Falls park. We went every day and explored a new trail. There is so much to see and do just steps from the front door. You won’t be disappointed if you chose to stay at the Bryd house."

Stayed a few nights","Gorgeous home in a beautiful setting. Since we were there in November, the vineyard was sparse but was still an amazing landscape and my sister and I did yoga there! The Noccalula falls is literally around the corner and offers an amazing hike and scenery.
The fenced back yard is ideal for dogs, and the owners are very accommodating and gracious with their pet policy.
The kitchen is stocked with most essentials you will need and is spacious for cooking and entertaining.
The fireplace inside isn’t operational, which is a shame because it is so gorgeous. But, the owners provide plenty of fire woods for the very unique and cool fire pit/stone chimney in the backyard.
My only complaint was that the owners house is essentially in the backyard/next door, and I would have wanted to know that prior to the arrival day instructions. Also, a couple people drove up to the house and accessed a shed on the property a couple times, and it felt very weird and intrusive.
The owners are VERY responsive and accommodating and I would def recommend this home to any travelers!"

Stayed a few nights","David was awesome. He answered all calls and texts immediately. He even came to hang out with us when we had a bonfire and played a couple rounds of cornhole (sorry we lost when I was on your team, David 😬). Overall, it was a fantastic stay. I'll definitely be booking with him, again, the next time I travel up that way.
P.S. Harley, the yellow lab, will greet you at your car door and be waiting for you at the front door in the mornings. He is the sweetest boy, even if he does shed a ""little."" He is also not afraid of a firepit, so help him to keep his tail out of the flames! Haha. Be sure to give him lots of love when you meet him, and tell him I say hi!!"

We had perfect weather so we hung out there, ate our meals there. The view is gorgeous and really let's you completely relax and take it all in. David was the epitome of the ultimate host. He was so gracious and very professional. Made sure we wanted for nothing. His house has EVERYTHING you could possibly need.
When i am back in the area, I hope his place is available. On top of that, I fell in love with his dog, Harley. He is the sweetest lab and loved all the attention that i could give him."

The boat ramp and dock were a great benefit, and David was incredibly helpful. If he hadn't helped us get our boat in the water, I don't think we would have made it!! The enclosed deck is amazing. What a wonderful peaceful place to sit and view the water. We watched a beautiful lightning storm move through from the deck. This is a house that has to be seen to be totally appreciated."

The open floor plan that looks out over the water is amazing. This will be a family vacation spot for many years to come. Brittany the host was literally a text or phone call away.

We really loved our stay and it is located right in old Gadsden town, which we found to be really cute and amazing, really loved waking up and walking down the street. Micah was amazing and very communicative always there to help which was above an beyond. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you so much Micah for all your hospitality! Cheers!"

There are quite a few steep steps up to the apartment (one flight) and no elevator, so just be aware if you’re traveling with a little one or someone who struggles with steps.
If steps are not a concern, highly recommend!"

This location was perfect. We were across the street from Pittman Theatre for our first night of the reunion weekend and then a short drive away from the main event on Saturday. If you are looking for a downtown location, with walking distance to many restaurants, stores and a coffee shop, i highly recommend you to make a reservation at Micah’s loft ."

Great area. Very walkable and central to many things.
Will definitely stay there again if we ever find ourselves that way. Would surely rent any property owned by Micah!

Stayed a few nights","I booked this place for a work conference in the area with the intention of traveling with my husband thinking while I was at the conference he would have a quiet place to spend the day, play some pool and hang out. He ended up not being able to come so it was just me. I didn’t get there as early as I had hoped so it was dark. Kevin and Bethanne had both communicated that the driveway was a little difficult to find so I knew I may have some issues and proceeded with caution. It was so dark. When I arrived though, Kevin quickly came out and showed me where to go and then gave me a tour of the place. It was the perfect place. Quiet, roomy, clean. Each morning I saw deer across the river eating and playing. I am from the city so it really was a treat to be in such a beautiful place. I will definitely keep this place in mind for any future trips to the area! Would definitely recommend checking it out!"

The place was really clean, and the billiards table was in pristine condition. They have a SmartTV so you can sign in and watch any shows you want to, and they stocked coffee, tea, and condiments for you. We plan on coming back to this location in the summer with our kids as it's truly a perfect spot."

Stayed a few nights","Executive Summary: If you’re planning to spend a relaxing weekend, week, or month in Gadsden, Kevin and Beth’s place is where you want to stay.
Long version: Gadsden isn’t a public transportation or walking town. Everything centers around boating and driving. If you’re planning to drive anyway, you should be sure to rest your head somewhere quiet and extremely comfortable. That’s Kevin’s place.
This is an Airbnb that’s designed to be lived in. And we speculate that the hosts have spent considerable time setting up and tuning the space to ensure that everything works smoothly.
The stay is a separate building not attached to the main house. You enter through sliding glass doors that provide a view of Kevin and Beth’s tributary of the lake. The space has very high ceilings throughout except for the bathroom. There’s a heater / air conditioner, two ceiling fans and even a dehumidifier (it’s on a lake in Georgia). During the heat of summer, we found the fans to be redundant.
Their kitchen amenities are of the highest quality. A serious gas stove, with quality pots and pans, Samsung microwave, coffee maker, fridge with ice maker, a toaster that actually evenly toasts, even an electric can opener. The only appliance missing from the kitchen is a dishwasher. Not an issue for us. We didn’t generate enough dirty dishes to mind hand-washing them.
The knives were even sharp. If you stay in enough airbnb’s you’ll learn how rare this is. The reason? There’s a knife steel in the block and a sharpener next to the block. Other hosts could learn a lot from Kevin.
The kitchen is large enough that two folks can prepare dinner without getting in each other’s way. As mentioned previously, all of the appliances are top-notch. If you need a tool or container and can’t find it in the drawers or cabinets, we would be astonished. Ice cream scoop, apple corer, immersion blender, julienne peeler…
There’s a large couch in the main room, and an easy chair, facing a large-screen TV which included the usual semi-infinite Roku options. Also in the main room is a high-end pool table.
And, there’s a roll-top desk as a wonderful dedicated workspace.
Adjacent to the breakfast bar in the kitchen is a dining table that will seat six comfortably.
The bathroom includes a shower with nozzles high enough for us tall folks, and room adjacent to the sink to store your stuff.
The mattress on the bed was a bit on the hard side, exactly the way we like it. The bedroom closet is large enough to hang everything in your suitcase.
We measured the internet speed as 40Mbs down and 20Mbs up, using our VPN.
Bottom line: Kevin and Beth’s place is quiet, comfortable, complete and fully functional. It doesn’t get any better than this. We’ll be back."

The place was so spacious, quiet, and well stocked. I was in town to visit family but had to work during the day. I would come back late at night but the automatic lights outside were a nice touch for safety. Giant TV was great and the sound system was nice to plug into my phone and play music. You can’t beat the views and it’s not a long drive back to the Main Street of town. It was an affordable stay too which factored into me choosing this location. I will definitely stay here again when visiting family in the future."

We sat on the dock and watched the sunset and then walked around the neighborhood that is surrounded by water. Comfortable bed, couch, every dish and appliance, plus a pool table!

Stayed a few nights","My wife, daughter and I were in town four days for a series of music concerts. We really liked the location, as it was in an older, well established neighborhood near the old downtown area.
The only problem we had was the wifi was not working because of an equipment failure from the provider. Mr Fortner was very diligent in his efforts to resolve the problem. Unfortunately, it required equipment replacement by AT&T and could not be resolved until the day we were leaving. Being unable to resolve the issue, Mr Fortner offered to refund our money and allow us to move. We chose to stay.
We feel he was very fair and would stay there again."

He was quick to answer calls, arrived within women’s to work towards the issues.
The Area had lost power for about nine hours before our arrival the high heat was challenging. Chris worked diligently to assure our comfort.
The only tough part about the trip was Mother natures high temp and thunder storms, which is beyond out control. Chris and Fortner’s Vacation Rentals LLC’s are an extreme
Delight. We were treated like family,. If you are looking for a taste of home, and not try to bust your wallet, Check this folks out. They will not disappoint. The area is very quiet if you just want to retreat and rest this spot would be ideal.."

This spot is in a great location, not too far from a lot of places, it was clean, we had water and snacks provided, and all-in-all I have no complaints! This is a great Airbnb for rock climbers to book as there are outdoor locations to climb within 10-30 minutes of here. Also, Kris was great! My crew and I managed to lock ourselves out of the apartment on the first night (it was our own fault), it was around 11 p.m., and I called Kris to which he thankfully responded. He came out of the comfort of his home to rescue us and was very welcoming and friendly. This was a great deal for us broke college students, and overall I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","The host is very responsive, but the location is not great at all. The neighborhood surrounding the rental seems unsafe. I wish I would have read the reviews describing the building as a former retirement housing or low-income housing facility prior to booking. The whole building is currently in process of renovations but is in disrepair. There was a horrible smell throughout the 15th floor, where this listing is located. When we walked in, there was dirt all over the bathroom floor and pubic hair on each surface of the bathroom. The host did offer to have the cleaning person come up and clean the room as soon as I messaged her, but at that point I was so aggravated by the appearance and experience that my child and I left and did not return. We ended up renting a hotel room in the area instead, so I was out double the amount of money I paid for the rental. I would not recommend staying here, although I did appreciate that the host responded quickly until I asked for a partial refund."

Beautiful views, soothing sound of the wind at night on the top floor, and smell good shower products provided are a few of the things that stood out for me during my stay.

It feels like so much thought and care went into creating Beloved’s Rest, and I’m so glad we booked this little getaway for our anniversary. We’re already checking our calendar to plan a trip back!"

Ive never been anywhere like it. The view over they valley, evening and night skys were memories to keep for us. We loved the fire places, wood by the hot tub and gas on viewing deck. We had a movienight with their projector, very cool. These guys thought of everything. They even had kindling in the fire pit outside for us.
We love the ton of Collinsville. We walked down there a good bit. They have a nice coffee/tea shop. Really good food. They also have a large Hispanic community with multiple convenience stores and a really nice dinner/grocery.
The hosts have something special here. Don’t miss out.

The hosts were very communicative and helpful. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate, so we couldn't go on the really beautiful looking hikes we had planned on, that are in the area. However, even the rain was beautiful and cozy and just meant we got to spend more time at Beloved's Rest--jacuzzi is amazing, lots of grilling and even a few outdoor games in-between showers! Couldn't recommend more, we definetly want to go back."

Kris and Katie has thought of everything you need to enjoy this place even down to the pillow spray!

Stayed a few nights","This is my second time renting Pamela’s loft and I can’t say enough about how nice and well appointed it is. It’s been a year and a half and everything still looks brand new.
Her communication throughout the process was very professional and helpful.
Internet was excellent, shower is hot and roomy. It’s all very spacious and comfortable. Parking in the garage takes some skills, but I got that and it was very convenient."

The whole place was just AMAZING! The master shower is to die for! We spent time around the firepit on the patio as well with a nice glass of wine. Pamela was wonderful and explaining everything and made great suggestions and quick responses when needed! I wish we could have stayed longer or even had a few days to bring our daughter with us! Love Love Love The Loft on Chesnut!!

Of course, it was the weekend and pubs should be loud but they recycle the glass bottles in middle of night and you will definitely hear it. If that bothers you, then not the place for you, but otherwise it was very clean, beautifully furnished, and private. Would stay again. I love Gadsden!"

Pamela really nailed the details to make it an easy stay. We were given great instructions for check-in and parking. Every switch and remote is labeled so you don't have to wonder what everything does. She provided a book with restaurant recommendations and of those we tried, they were all excellent.
The kitchen was stocked with plates, cups, bowls, cooking utensils, spices, paper towels, dish soap, etc. There was washing detergent for both the washing machine and the dish washer. There were even K Cups supplied for the coffee pot.
The couch and bed were both super comfortable. The shower is amazing with multiple shower heads. The rooftop patio was great too. The sitting area with gas fire pit was awesome. The ability to close curtains to block the cold wind was great, and the picnic table was nice for eating.
This review doesn't do it justice. If you are even considering booking this airbnb just do it, you won't be disappointed."

We started our days in the kitchen that had everything we needed for a full breakfast. Spices, pots, pans, coffee, creamer; we had it all.
Most days we left to explore the hiking trails, shops, and restaurant recommendations, but returned early enough each day to have quiet evenings by the fire.
While this was a pleasure trip, the dining room nook was perfect for sitting for a couple of hours and getting my work done on the provided wi-fi.
10/10 all the way around!"

Stayed a few nights","This loft is by far one of the nicest places my wife and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. There are no amenities or touches left unaccounted for. The best example is the towels on the back overlook porch that are there so that if the seating is damp from rain you can cover them. The only thing you need to provide is yourself, and food if you intend to cook.
All of downtown Gadsden is a 5 minute walk. There are plenty of shops and great restaurants less than 2 minutes by foot. The best part of that immediacy is that, despite being so close, the loft is peaceful and secluded enough to feel as though you are miles from the main drag.
Pamela is an excellent host who responds promptly and with a very friendly demeanor. She has tons of recommendations for local food and fun that, if you haven't already, would give you more than enough to utilize for an itinerary.
I could go on, but frankly you should just rent it yourself. Don't think twice."

The appointments she provided with the rental was exceptional as well. I could have shown up with nothing but my clothes and had everything I needed to enjoy my stay...down to the little details...such as even providing good clips for my Frito chip bag. A great coffee machine with coffee provided. The nice robes were an additional, thoughtful offering. Everything is in excellent condition, well maintained and very clean. The deck is private and just as advertised in the photo. The rental is in an older commercial district that although old, had a nice vibe to it. The private parking garage was very useful with a provided clicker to easily come and go. If in the Gadsden area again...her place will be the first I try to rent.

Stayed a few nights","The Loft at Chestnut was an EXCELLENT get-away. It was a couples retreat for us, and a base for us to go ride bicycles on the Chief Ladiga Trail, which is about 35 minutes away by car. The Loft itself has more than everything thought of. Seriously.
The living space is large and yet very cozy. A grand island separating the greatroom from the kitchen is large, with plenty of space for cooking, snacking and planning activities all at the same time. The bedroom was quiet, comfortable, and the large closet made putting your bag out of the way a snap! The master bath/shower is fantastic ---and--- the ""bonus"" of having the half bath off the great room was SOOOoo convenient when two folks are getting ready to WALK out to dinner! Last, the upstairs, rooftop space is such a deluxe feature. Seriously nice. We caught the spring weather on a perfect weekend where it was just cool enough for the firepit, and yet warm enough to enjoy the breeze. And also coffee in the mornings.
The Downtown area was an unexpected gem. Lots of shops, boutiques and food-gettin'-places all within easy walking or cycling distance! The rehabilitation happening is WELL underway and VERY interesting to witness :)
Truly a delux couples getaway - we plan to come back. Fo' Sho' ..."

There is only a small grocery store, Subway, Jack's, Dollar General, McDonalds & 3 gas stations all on one corner. That it. Sharecroppers is a coffee shop that sells other food & merchandise but closes @ 4 PM.
All somewhat major areas about 40 mins to 1 hr to get to. The scenery with mountains, cotton farms, lakes & sick beautiful. If you want quiet at night & don't driving everywhere, Dave's place the spot to.
The house is fully stocked with everything will need. Fenced in yard for kids and/or pets. Cul de sac road work maybe 10 houses, so it is safe kids.
I'd recommend house & stay if you want an affordable homey feeling & want country living & a wonderful host."

The location is perfect for someone looking to stay in a quiet neighborhood but still be minutes from everything to do and eat. Can’t wait to come back here in the future. Also wanted to mention the host is very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend for anyone staying in the area!

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay at Kacey’s while we were visiting my in-laws. Plenty of seating and perfectly comfortable beds. The main bathroom is amazing and the kitchen is nice to cook in. The only thing I would mention for future guests is that it is not stocked in any way in the kitchen or bathroom beyond the very essential basics of TP and towels and a hair dryer in the bathroom. No shampoo or conditioner etc. Be sure to bring your own of everything you need.
In the kitchen we really only found salt and pepper and some sugar for the coffee. They did have small packets of creamers but literally that’s it. Several cabinets were locked off with zip ties so we assume a lot of that stuff was in there.
It was super clean and tidy and comfortable and the whole family really enjoyed it. We would definitely stay here again."
