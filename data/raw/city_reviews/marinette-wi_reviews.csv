Group trip","We enjoyed a peaceful and cozy weekend with a great view of Lake Michigan! The only downside was that the wifi password they provided did not work, and the host did not respond when notified. Nobody had cell service in the area so that made it very difficult to look up directions, things to do, etc."

The morning sunrise with coffee on the back deck was a highlight of our stay,don’t miss out on that! We were in town to visit family in the area so we didn’t get to spend as much time at this property as we would have liked, next time we’ll plan on extra days!

Stayed a few nights","Mitzi has a largely great place. Lots of nice homie touches, high quality furnishing, very clean, great value. I'm not sure if this was just a simple mistake, but in the spirit of the self-referee system of air bnb, I do feel I should mention that we were unable to shower while we were there (water came out of the spot where you control the water temp rather than the showerhead). Our stay was short, so we didn't have a chance for the host to resolve this while we were there, but it felt like a bit of a substantial oversight to us and we have not received any explanation or communication from the host since mentioning this yesterday morning during check out (~24 hrs ago)."

Stayed over a week","Most of the stay was pleasant and the place is well-stocked. Lovely marina and lots of places that deliver around the area. The host was aggressive and accosting over a miscommunication pertaining to house rules. She started accusing me of things that never happened and spoke in a childish, uncontrolled tone. Some issues pertaining to Covid safety as well (people come around the house to work without wearing masks, host wanted to come into the house despite me living with an immunocompromised person predicating that visit not on Covid testing and isolation, but on us being ""well""--God forbid we were asymptomatic). Be prepared to be surrounded by paranoid people who scream and throw a fit rather than settling issues in a calm and collected way."

We ended up hiking 2 nearby waterfalls - beautiful area of Wisconsin! Tricia was very helpful and friendly and even stopped by in person to make sure we were settling in okay. Will definitely reconsider booking here in the summer months to take advantage of the beautiful river."

We grew up in Marinette but never experienced the Menominee River, we were pleasantly surprised.
It was definitely worth the stay.

Stayed with a pet","We couldn't have imagined a more beautiful place to spend an extended weekend to get away from the city! The pictures don't really do the beauty of this place justice. My partner and I and our dog spent four days in early September and cooked up a storm in the well-equipped kitchen, kayaked and paddle-boated the river a few times, watched scary movies inside, and just generally enjoyed the cozy, comfortable, and peaceful cottage and its surroundings. While we were there, we checked out the Peshtigo Fire Museum (love a good museum!), Forgotten Fire Winery (tasty wine and friendly people!), and Zinger Coffee (fantastic coffee and house-baked scones). Tricia was a wonderful host, keeping the place spotless and comfortable and checking on us moments after we arrived. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, beautiful place to write, reflect, rest, or just spend some time away from life."

Lovely little cottage next to the Menominee river. Very clean and cute home. Comfortable beds. Grill which we used every night. Our favorite features were the all day access to the kayaks, paddle boards, and pedal boat. Our pre-teen and teenage kids loved the paddle boards. Also, the fire pit was great. The owners are so friendly. If you are looking for a camp like experience, but with the comforts of home, this is an excellent choice."

It’s hard finding places who are trusting of dogs, so this was a huge win for us! 4 adults were able to stay comfortably. The place was beautiful, cozy and everything the listing said. We would love to come back in the summer to be able to use the fire pit and water activities. Before we arrived, Tricia stayed in touch with recommendations and clear instructions and directions. She checked in throughout the weekend and made sure we had everything we needed. Such a positive experience and very reasonably priced! You won’t regret booking her place! Thank you so much!"

Beds are Super comfortable and cottage is simplified and minimalist yet has everything you actually need. Super adorable decor!
The cleanliness was important to me & it met all my standards!!

Group trip","Tricia’s cottage is very cozy and we were pleasantly surprised with everything that it is stocked with; everything you’ll need is in the house. It is very clean and connecting to the wifi was easy. Walmart, Aldi and other stores/restaurants are pretty close by. The fire pit to the side was a big plus, especially since the bonfire accessories were easily accessible on the side of the house. This was a great relaxing weekend away and we would recommend this place!"

The bed made me feel like I was sleeping on a cloud, it was so very comfortable! We walked to the nearby Supper Club for drinks and dinner on the first night, which was so convenient. Anything you needed was within a very short drive. Tricia was so accommodating and great with directions and communication. We look forward to staying again and recommend to everyone."

Great view of the water and the fire pit outside was perfect for relaxing and watching the water. We usually stay at dog friendly places and this is one of the best we have found and no crazy high pet fee! Tricia was great with communication and when we arrived she loved on pups and made them feel welcome too. It’s incredibly close to Marinette and Menominee so we could explore both and find great food and coffee, but also feels miles away from everything when you return to relax. We will return as often as we can!"

Outside the cottage was just as wonderful! The scenery, the so beautiful!

The cabin is sort of close to the road but the fence made it much more private and quiet than you would expect. The hosts were very helpful with whatever we needed, we loved our stay!

The cottage was just like the pictures. It was clean and new. We used kayaks and the pedal boat. There were two docks you could fish from. We enjoyed sitting outside on the patio and having fires in the fire pit. We also enjoyed Tricia's recommendations - visited several waterfalls and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, ate at local restaurants - La Cabana was by far our favorite. We highly recommend staying here."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay in the cottage! It was clean, comfortable, and cute. We felt that it was thoughtfully designed and stocked, and it was great to have a full kitchen available if we needed it. There are plenty of stores nearby for groceries, etc. There is some traffic noise as it is right off the road, but it wasn’t too bad. The easy access to the river was wonderful, and it was so nice to be able to use the kayaks and pedal boat. When we were there, the river was not busy at all so we were very comfortable with our kids doing water activities without having to worry about them being in the way of boats or jet skis; they were able to have more independence and be safe. The water is shallow for a good bit around the docks and there are lots of water plants, which isn’t particularly great for swimming (although that didn’t stop our kids), but it was great for floating around in inner tubes and other water activities. Our family highly recommends Winding River Cottages, and we hope to vacation here in the future."

We were able to use the kayaks during our stay a few times to explore the river, which was so fun. We even took the pontoon out, which was awesome. The river is pretty quiet and not overly crowded even on the weekends. The host supplies pretty much all you need during your stay. The dogs were comfortable here, although there isn't much room for them to run outside. We did find a park that we took them to for their walks which was about 10 minutes away on Lake Michigan. The bed was probably one of the comfiest I have slept in during a trip. Tricia is very responsive to all questions we had during our trip and reached out to us when we were there to make sure we were comfortable. We loved this place and can't wait to stay again!"

The view is stunning (catch a sunrise over the river if you can) and the property is super cute and well-cared for. We really appreciated having access to the canoe and kayaks - we spent a few hours outside enjoying the scenery on the river. The kitchen is stocked with everything you’d need to cook or grill with. We also loved having a fire pit for s’mores and relaxing at night. Tricia is so welcoming and attentive, she even helped us get in the boats (we would have struggled without her at first, haha!). She gives great suggestions for things to do in the area, so you won’t be wondering what to do. It’s a border town, so you can go to and from Michigan in a matter of 10 minutes or less. Menominee had a great sunset view and a lot of restaurants. In Marinette, we went to the Forgotten Fire winery - a must-go! There were also plenty of stores near by. The cottage itself was modern, clean, had a smart thermostat, good wifi, as well as plenty of necessities/extras in the kitchen and bathroom. I can’t recommend this enough if you’re looking for a stay in NE Wisconsin! We hope to go back for another fun weekend in the future."

The Evergreen cottage was super stylish, comfortable and CLEAN! The views to the Menomonee river are amazing. We made use of the fire pit several nights and the double grill-one side gas-one side charcoal. Nice touch. Would 100% stay again with our doggies!"

Otherwise a clean and responsive host, but know that gaining access to the river is not a walk in the park."

The beds are all comfortable, as is the recliner in the sectional in the living room. There were plenty of supplies available in the bathrooms, kitchen and laundry.
The ranch is out far enough that it is very quiet, but not so far that’s it’s a journey to get anywhere close by (Peshtigo, Marinette, etc.). Communication with the owner is very good; responsive and prompt.

Stayed one night","Horrible experience w/ double booking, do NOT book, and do NOT trust Erez’s “Superhost” status
**Tl;dr: There was already ANOTHER GUEST in it when we checked in. We couldn’t reach the host at all, and had to find alternative lodging around midnight.
When we arrived, the passcode did not open the door. As we were fumbling with the lock, a tall man showed up at the door, and asked us what was our problem. Feeling threatened and confused (“what was he doing in our house?”), we backed off and called and texted the host. The host read our message but did not respond.
After failing to reach the host for an hour in 35F temperature, we drove to a hotel at 1am. The hotel fortunately had a room left.
The host got back to us around noon the next day. In a short note, he stated that the listing was double booked. How could that be allowed to happen? And Erez is a superhost?"

Group trip","Property appeared just as presented through the app. Had great weather, and location was prime.
An unfortunate thing to mention is the overwhelming smell of cat urine and/or litter box smell found through the residence. Contacted Erez right away and he asked what could be done and was attentive. Unfortunately there wasn’t much they could do at that hour when we checked in. We masked the smell with cooking dinner.
It should be noted that Erez states no cats live or have been on the property although all 4 visitors displayed allergy symptoms with the house closed up.
Price was a little steep seeing that the home needs some improvements and the cat urine smell.
Still a beautiful property and would give a second chance if issue was corrected."

Stayed one night","The Airbnb is on a former horse farm. It is a very pretty property with the former stables still on the property. A couple acres of land. The house itself I believe is a double wide manufactured home. There is a dining room and kitchen. Note the coffee maker was in one of the kitchen cabinets. There is not a Keurig. There is a dishwasher. There is a full sized washer and dryer. Two bedrooms. Two baths, one of which is a large master bathroom. A large living room, though part of it is just empty space. There is what looked like an old wood fireplace in the living room. The master had a tv. The floor vents are kind of in odd places. The bed in the master was a California King. Very comfortable."

The house itself was clean and just what we expected. The outside seating and fire pit was perfect for evenings outside. There was a pretty bad storm which caused the power to go out but the host was very quick to reply and help in any way he could. I highly recommend this location and property if you’re looking for a relaxing weekend.

We had no apps and had a hard time figuring out how to watch any tv. The basement steps are steep and scary. I was in contact with Marian and her manager Amy who were both perceptive, about the steps. I recommend you keep that door closed. Get some automatic lighting for the stairway. Caution sign? Railing on the right to the top of the steps? We would have liked to have made the table smaller as well but couldn’t figure it out. Otherwise the place was lovely. Very nice and close to lake. Just wish more to do for entertainment in the area"

Stayed with kids","Cathy’s house was such a hidden gem. My family and I came to Marinette to visit my grandparents, and it was so reassuring to have a house to stay that was not only close in proximity, but also very accommodating for my family. We have two young kids, and Cathy’s house was incredibly spacious for us all. Cathy was very friendly and communicated very well. Her instructions were clear, and she was very helpful with any questions that we had. We truly had a great time at Cathy’s house and we will be back!"

Cathy’s place is spacious, clean, and comfortable- I slept in the upstairs master suite and the mattress was perfection! I got a great nights sleep. All communication with Cathy was fast, clear and friendly. Would stay again next time I’m in the area, thanks Cathy!"

Stayed over a week","Enjoyed our stay here very much!
Cathy is indeed a Superhost! We had a glitch the first night (low battery in smoke alarm) which she promptly fixed the next day.
Everything was very clean and neat, and the house is well furnished. There are even condiments in the fridge for your use if you need them.
The neighborhood is very quiet, only some traffic from time to time plus a few trains here and there. Nothing to lose sleep over.
The Wi-Fi is very good, very fast, very reliable.
We will definitely stay here again!"

Also she had the heat turned up for us before arrival which was nice for the southern girls coming into the frozen tundra. I plan to stay here again.
