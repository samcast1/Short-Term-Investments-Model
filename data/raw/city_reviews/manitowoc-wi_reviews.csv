Stayed with a pet",We stayed at Katie's place for 5 months. The house had everything you would need for an extended period of time and the comforts of home. They had new kitchen appliances and a decent washer and dryer. They had Wi-Fi and nice televisions. One in the Livingroom and one in the main bedroom. They had a nice big back yard which worked out well for our dogs. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Katie would check-in on occasion by text to be sure we had everything we needed. We were lucky to find her home for our extended stay.

The house its self was very comfortable and very clean. It was nice to be able to put our car in the garage at night too. We will definitely look to staying here again when we return.

Stayed a few nights",great place. great location. very clean and fits great. only draw back is the third bedroom that has a pullout is not for adults. the pullout itself couldn't sleep anyone over 40 lbs comfortably as the mattress is about 1.5 inches thick and you can feel every wire and bar for support. better to use the apace for an air matress. deffinately would stay again.

Katie's house was everything and beyond what we needed. loved having a highchair for the baby.
surprise air hockey table for my older kids to play.

extra portable fans was a big hit for me as I'm always hot at night.
big open living room for the kids to play.

Stayed a few nights","Katie’s house was convenient to everything we wanted to do on a holiday weekend without the chaos of being right in the mix of it. The house is tastefully decorated and well furnished with anything you could possibly need. Very peaceful and close to nature walk right across street. Katie was very accommodating and let us know that the house was ready for early check in. While we weren’t able to take advantage of it due to travel schedules, she was kind enough to let us stay an extra hour on the day of check out to accommodate a work telephone call.
Great few days and very hospitable! Highly recommended!"

I was worried about being on the lower level with someone upstairs, but you couldn't even tell there was anyone else there! We came for a Green Bay game and it was only a 45 min drive. the apartment was close to everything, but far enough where it was still peaceful. Close to the water as well! Definitely a great area! We will definitely come back in the Summer with our kids, knowing there are amenities in the apartment to make their stay easier! thanks for having us!"

Stayed a few nights","It was a really nice place to stay at in Manitowoc. Downtown and the harbour were easily reachable by foot which made for a nice walk and all other amenities like stores and restaurants are easy to get to by car.
It was really lovely that they checked up on us asking if check-in went alright. I personally was charmed by the little “house rule book” with personal info about the hosts as well as suggestions what to do. It felt really Midwest-nice and as someone who used to live in the area I really appreciated the “go Pack go” at the end of the hosts introduction.
We were at first worried about fitting our car in the parking spot without blocking anyone but that wasn’t a problem at all either. The apartment is also spacious yet cozy so it was perfect for two people to have enough space for one but also share a space without it feeling crowded.
I’d stay here again!"

My family is from Manitowoc, so we are very familiar with the area and available accommodations, but none of us live locally anymore. My parents were staying at a hotel in the same area and after seeing the place decided they would look into booking it the next time they're in town. Highly recommend for long or short-term stays!"

Lots of natural light. We never used the TV or the WiFi, but the instructions were clear. Great water pressure & nice hot water - something you don't always get from a hotel. Outlets were accessible for charging and it was nice to have nightlights. We were in town for a funeral and we appreciated that there was plenty of seating and mugs for tea to have relatives over for a visit. Would definitely book again!"

Everything was as described. The beds and furniture were comfortable. It was a well-stocked place with a pack n play (fit perfectly in a large closet so baby had her own sleeping space), baby shampoo, a couple bonus books/games for the kids to read/play. Even the Tupperware came in handy. We had everything we needed. The kids also loved finding various nooks and crannies to hide in, in this older house.
We walked to the Ice Age Trail, parks, the Farmer’s market, the Maritime Museum, downtown, etc. It was a great location. If we visit Manitowoc in the future we would happily book here again."

Stayed a few nights",This place was just as advertised except it should be listed as a duplex. I really only have one downside which is the water pressure in the shower was very low which is a pet peeve of mine. Very clean and no issues with the property. I was looking for an affordable alternative to a hotel and this place was definitely it. Close to stores and restaurants. In town for Manitowoc Ice training and this was the perfect location. I felt right at home. I did not have to contact Alberto one time which was great to me. When I go back I would definitely stay again. I highly recommend.

Stayed with kids","You get what you pay for. Pros: cheap, clean, good location, extra sheets and blankets, lots of storage in kitchen, washer and dryer. There was enough toliet paper. The ice machine on the refrigerator pumped out plenty of ice.
Cons: Ants, A/C unit in one room (upstairs was super hot) No real outside space, no private yard. This is a house split into two sections (think more of a duplex), not a whole home, so you definitely need to worry about noise. You also share the driveway. There is no work space with a door, 2 out of 3 mattresses old, and CREAKY. Ant spray and ant bait traps were all over, which is not great for the kiddos who want to mess with everything. Very small bathroom with no room for storage or extra towels. The window in the shower gave me the heebie jeebies.

It was cheap, so I gave it a good rating but it was nothing memorable and I wouldn't go back."

Stayed over a week","Great location! Only about 5 minutes to downtown and 10 minutes to many restaurants and grocery stores. Loved that there was off-street parking separate from the driveway and you are situated next to a church, so you don't hear much noise from the neighbors. Good WiFi for two remote workers. The downsides are that the two bedrooms upstairs do not have air conditioning, so it can get extremely hot up there especially after you do laundry (under the stairs). We found a fan in one of the bedroom closets, but unfortunately it was broken, so we had to purchase one to sleep comfortably. There was a bad ant problem on the main floor upon our arrival. Although, the host was quick to respond and drop off bait traps and spray, which quickly filled up, the ants kept moving throughout the main floor so we were constantly spraying during the month stay. We kept the majority of our belongings off the floor or upstairs, and never had an issue."

You could park on the street, but with the snow, I didn't. Everything worked as needed. I felt the house was very spacious, and the laundry worked out great. Yes, there is a tint on the shower window. You won't hear the back tenants unless you're in the kitchen. Lake Michigan is easily a 5 minute drive away. I was here for work and would very gladly come back to stay."

Stayed with a pet",Baley’s place was perfect and exactly what the photos looked like. Baley was super accommodating and easy to communicate with. This is a great location with easy access to anywhere in town really. I appreciated the little touches like dog bowls out since we were traveling with dogs. I would absolutely stay here again!

The house has a sense of style with tile floors accented with granite countertops. Backsplash was an understated subway tile. Just beautiful! The place was spacious, yet cozy. I requested the use of Val's fire pit. She told me where to find economical, dry firewood and provided a fire starter. The next day was rainy so she suggested a fire in the fireplace. Can it get any better than this? She also pointed me to hiking very near her home, and did I mention her home is a block from Lake Michigan?!"

Her house is just amazing!
Everyone said clean and we fully agree but let me add that Valerie has provided just every amenity you could need! We had no problems in her huge and well stocked modern kitchen.
We loved the bathroom! Literally a huge dressing Space and vanity with sufficient room AND lighting to put makeup on. There are comfy towels available. Toothbrushes, paste and even mouthwash left for us!
It was the little things that made this stay so enjoyable.
The beds are so comfortable and the rooms just adorable! We loved the angular look of the house and had fun exploring. The couches are cozy and the ambience is wonderful.
LOCATION! Literally a three minute walk to the Lake to sit on a bench even watch the sunrise! Short drive to restaurants and of course ice cream.
We enjoyed the stay so much and the area if we could give ten stars we would!"

We hosted family from England for a short one day vacation and I can't express how much we all enjoyed the great location, amenities, and unique artistic experience. The billiard room was perfect for a snacky afternoon hangout/Pool shooting. We made great use of the sitting room and played a few comfortable hours of board games with lots of great memories. It was such a delight to be close to the downtown action, even though we didn't venture beyond the warf, but we will just have to wait till our next visits. A sure place we want to visit again!!!"

3 blocks from most restaurants in downtown Manitowoc and a couple great coffee and breakfast spots.
Al is friendly, quiet, and never intrusive. He also offers a nice parking spot right in front of the garage. Had I read his instructions, I’d have known this and not parked on the street the first night when I arrived, thus receiving a hefty parking the ticket the next day during a snow emergency 😬 ignorance is pricey.
When Al noticed, he insisted he take care of it!?!? 😳. A true cheesehead!
I’ll be looking into place next time in in town!"

The second night my hubby and I used the apartment after a long, ridiculous fun wedding - and it was amazing to come back to a cool room, with a very comfortable bed. There were lots of little things that made our stay more comfortable... like a great hair dryer, nice water pressure in the shower, a nice sized fridge, extra blankets - etc. The apartment was just what we expected and needed for a great weekend.

The space has some old world charm with it’s vintage sink and slightly sloping floors. Bed was very comfortable. The pillows were not to our preference (only one was, but there were two of us) so we may bring some if we come back. We couldn’t get the vintage heater to work, but the small space heater provided did the trick as it wasn’t that cold. Overall a great stay and we’d book again without much hesitation - other than confirming instructions for the heater if it’s the middle of winter."

Stayed a few nights","This was a clean and very conveniently located space! The unit is a separate apartment on the upper floor, and it was recently renovated with fresh paint and nice feeling. It's a spacious unit with several comfortable chairs as well. There is a separate entrance and a driveway to park in. The host lives below and is conveniently available if needed.
The best thing is the location. It's only a few blocks from the heart of the town and is very convenient to stroll down to the shops, cafes, riverwalk, and lakefront. This is also as close as you can get to stay for the maritime museum which is the chief attraction in town.
Lastly, if you're visiting for disc golf, it's great for both Silver Creek and Rollin Ridge, located in between the two. Silver Creek is a quick 10 minutes away and Rollin Ridge about 25 minutes.
Overall it was a great experience without any issues and I recommend it if you're visiting Manitowoc!"

The lawn needed mowing/maintenance and the trash had not been picked up in a while as several bags were in the outside cans. Other than that it was a nice experience!

The TV is located in the basement which made the family area upstairs perfect to connect! Everything we did was a short drive from the house. We even left a pillow behind which Rigoberto was quick to respond to make sure it found its way home. I would definitely stay here again!

Stayed with kids","This house is a great fit for a family, group of friends, or a couple of families. Plenty of space, beds, and bathrooms, has been updated, and was clean. The house is off a fairly busy street, but the road noise is minimal for the most part. We didn't even have any issues sleeping in the front bedroom, but you do occasionally hear louder vehicles (motorcycles and large trucks primarily) while in the home. You may have to wait to get out for traffic sometimes as well. We enjoyed hanging out in the basement with the massage chair, playing air hockey, and watching movies after spending time at the beach or museums in town. As another reviewer mentioned, the only TV is in the basement. Not a huge deal, but I had missed that detail in the info. The home had several toiletries available if you wanted to use them (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc) we had our own, but it was nice to have an option if you forgot or ran out. I also did a fair amount of laundry since we went swimming most days and it was nice having the washer/dryer and supplies if you wanted to use them (laundry soap, bleach, fabric softener, etc) We found the beds to be firmer than we prefer, but others may appreciate that. We didn't do much cooking, but I saw pots, pans, cookie sheets, along with all the dishes and silverware. The one big thing I wanted to note was the stairs to the 2nd floor are fairly steep and narrow, which wasn't noticeable in the pictures. It wasn't an issue for us, but older adults or young children are likely to be more of a concern. Rigoberto was quick to respond to questions that came up and kind when a dish was accidently broken. Overall we had a great trip and enjoyed the home!"

Stayed a few nights","Rigoberto's place is such a charm! We stayed here for a disc golf tournament last week and were blown away by the gorgeous remodelling and decorating he had done, since it's clearly an older home. Everything was clean, neat, and tidy. There's a smart thermostat with a QR code that helps you quickly get connected to wifi (such a nice touch!). The first floor bathroom is gorgeous, the front room is so cozy (that couch is to die for!) and the sun room off of the main house was such a joy to read in. There are two bedrooms on the first floor and one is right off the front of the house. If you're a light sleeper and staying in the front bedroom, you may want to consider earplugs since there is quite a bit of traffic between 4-6 a.m during the week. The upstairs bedrooms are surprisingly very large, and the en suite master bathroom with a barn door is magical. Something to note: the mattresses are very soft so if you're sharing a bed, you and your partner will sink into the middle.
The Smart TV is downstairs in the basement, and we were blown away by how great the surround sound is (definitely a movie theater experience!). The massage chair was such a hit, especially for all the guys playing in the tournament. There is a bathroom down there as well, but there isn't a mirror so definitely a function only bathroom. We also had a blast playing with the air hockey table and the Foosball table.
Something that we didn't consider was the fact that there isn't a dishwasher, so if you're staying with a larger group you might want to consider picking up paper plates if you don't want to do a ton of dishes. The house is also situated off of a main street with a single-car long driveway, so if you're staying with multiple people, you'll have to do some car shuffling. Also, the backyard is definitely not a hang-out spot since the yard is pretty overgrown. There are plenty of other places to hang, but it would have been nice to have a fire during the summer nights.
Something the listing doesn't say which is a TOTAL positive: It's within walking distance of the Aquatic center which is essentially a mini water park and has a mini golf course. If were we had more time, we were definitely checking it out! Adults are 7 dollars and children 3-17 are 6 dollars for admission. There's also a charming bookstore within walking distance and a coffee and ice cream shop a little more down the way. We would definitely stay here again!"

It's located close to the lake, downtown area, and many quality restaurants. Manitowoc is an underrated gem in Wisconsin. The Evergleam displays at the Library and in the store windows around Christmas are fantastic! It's a winter wonderland!
My Hostess Tina was very receptive and got back to me quickly. She made everything as easy as it could be. I'll definitely be back."

The kitchen has everything you need, including a dishwasher, plenty of pots, pans, and utensils (even a waffle maker!). The large new TV with Netflix was a plus. The location is close to everything Manitowoc has to offer, and there’s a good bakery right down the block. Tina was responsive and accommodating. The apartment is quiet; although there are tenants downstairs, we never heard them. Our favorite part was the extremely comfortable beds (and our bedroom had room darkening curtains); we slept well. We hope to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","One word sums up our stay at Tina’s place in Manitowoc, and that word is simply INCREDIBLE!!!
I can’t say enough positive about our very first Airbnb experience, literally from beginning to end ❤️
We came to celebrate our 22nd Anniversary and have left with grateful hearts and some amazing memories that we will forever treasure.
One thing superseded my expectations, so please allow me a little extra brag time.
Originally my hubby and I had only planned to stay 3 nights, however after not having nearly enough time to do even half of what we’d have liked to I reached out to Tina asking if it would be possible for us to extend our stay by one day. Not only did she allow us to add on to our trip at the last minute, she trusted us to just leave her the cash for the extra night on her kitchen table when we checked out🥰 Thank you Tina for making our first Airbnb experience so wonderful, we are already looking for to our next trip❤️"

Stayed a few nights","3 C’s: Cute, Cozy, Comfortable! I couldn’t have been happier with Tina’s place! The moment I walked in, I felt like I was Home. I came for R & R and it definitely fit the bill as a place to relax in comfort. My sisters from Appleton met me at Tina’s place and they also thought it was perfect. Tina has the place very well-equipped - easy to do meals right there. I’m a walker and enjoyed that so much was within walking distance - the lake, the downtown, the KwikTrip, the bakery, etc. The outside stairs are a good climb, so that might be difficult for some - no problem for me. The bed was comfortable and it was very quiet even though 11th Street gets a fair amount of traffic. There is a small bench at the landing at the top of the outdoor stairs and I loved sitting out there with my coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. I have nothing negative to say about the place or Tina’s attentiveness - hopefully, I can stay there again."

-have fun
-make love
-open the windows and enjoy the breeze on a 70 degree summer day
This is the worst experience with Airbnb I’ve ever had. The host made it feel like the gulag. I understand having people stay in an apartment above you isn’t for everyone - but then they should remove the listing from Airbnb and stop hosting people."

If you have mobility issues the stairs up the back of the house might be an issue (not an issue for us though). Comfortable beds with cushy bedding (almost too warm for me, but that's solved by adjusting layers). We didn't use the TV, but it looked nice. The apartment-sized kitchen, complete with plates, cocktail glasses, coffee mugs, a large refrigerator / freezer, coffee pot, blender, oven, and dishwasher (I might have still missed a few things?), is VERY nice -- the pots and pans felt brand new, as did the great variety of kitchen utensils and spice rack. The place over all is very clean, with great amenities, and Tina is an attentive host who answered all our questions and went the extra mile. We didn't get to meet her in person, which is precisely what we wanted when traveling during COVID. :) Highly recommended!"

Stayed about a week","House was perfect for us. The hot water heater for the bath tub did not full the tub so it was only warm not hot. There could have been more pots in the cabinets and more storage containers, but overall things were great.
The house is located off of a ""frontage"" road so a little difficult to find initially but worth the u turn that it took to get to the house.
Thank you for a very warm and welcoming home for us to spend our holiday season."

Stayed with kids","Wonderful home right off the main thoroughfare. Warm, inviting, and well maintained. Right around the corner from my parents place and just a few minutes from shopping and the beach. Would definitely stay again."
