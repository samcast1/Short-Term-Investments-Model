Stayed a few nights","We needed a place to stay for a week while we had our floors refinished. Brians place was absolutely perfect. The house is in a Great neighborhood, walk to park, river, downtown, restaurants, Lawrence University. Coffee on the sunny deck in the morning was wonderful. The kitchen was well stocked with everything I could have needed, including a blender for making smoothies. The bedding was high quality, I loved the sheets so much, I'm going to have to find out where they were purchased. The key pad for entry was one of the easiest I've ever used. I highly recommend staying at Brians place!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay with a quiet estate.
Host was easy to deal with and understanding. Good neighbours on the look out too, we had forgotten to close a window after cooking and was reminded by the host.
The only bad point is the noise insulation was poor, you could hear those at level 2 and vice versa.
Overall had a great stay there."

The house has been tastefully updated and
has old home charm with updated amenities.
If you stay during the winter holidays, the neighborhood is decorated with lighted orbs that seem magical as you drive through.
This house had everything we needed!
This is the second home we have rented from them and I would highly recommend renting any of their homes."

It was so nice to have a “home” to come home too after long and somewhat stressful days at the hospital. The house is nicely and cheerfully decorated and clear of clutter. The kitchen, living and dining spaces are nice and open and provide a relaxing atmosphere. The house has a nice long driveway for several cars to fit and the neighborhood is peaceful. We enjoyed seeing the holiday lights in the nearby homes."

Stayed with a pet","This was my 2nd time staying at Brian's place - I've stayed at a few of his other properties, as well. It's a great home base for me when I drive up from Asheville, NC, to visit my Grandma - and I can bring my ride or die, my dog River, who LOVES the big, fenced yard (I just wish there was a gate between the house and the garage so it was 100% fenced).
Brian and his co-host, Max, were INCREDIBLY helpful and accommodating this trip. I had originally booked for Sept 12-14, but then my Grandma had a medical emergency, and I needed to drive up early. Brian and Max rescheduled my reservation at no additional charge AND offered me free early check in. It made a very sad and stressful situation so much easier!
The house is super-cute and has everything you need for a short- or long-term stay! I haven't used the upstairs either time I've stayed, but it would be great for kids or other guests."

Stayed with a pet","Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Brian’s home with my little dog. It is located in a quiet neighborhood with lovely homes overlooking a wooded ravine. It is so peaceful. You have access to walking trails and are close to the river and downtown Appleton with its many restaurants. The charming restaurant Ellinor is in the neighborhood…definitely a must if you can get a reservation!
The home is spotless and exactly as pictured. I am not a good sleeper, but the home was so calming and the bed so comfortable I slept wonderfully.
Brian’s partner Max was a great host and was so attentive to questions and made the stay perfect. Highly recommend this listing!"

House has everything you need for an extended stay, comfortable bed, clean, feels lived in and not like a bare bones income property... and man that back deck! You can take a walk from the back yard past the little garden, right into the woods, and you pop out in a beautiful park! Safe quiet neighborhood, and a just a few minute drive to college ave where all the good bars and restaurants are at. I highly recommend and will definitely be staying again next time I'm in the area!"

Tastefully decorated, well-maintained, with a litany of little things that stood out showing not only attention to detail, but the desire to go above and beyond. (One such example is having universal charging cables in every single room.) Absolutely loved our stay and couldn’t recommend more highly. Thanks for everything guys!

Stayed with a pet","I grew up in Appleton, and my pup (River) and I took a roadtrip from NC to visit my 104 year old Grandma in her nursing home. I truly loved my stay at Mark's place, and I found myself wishing I had another night there to fully enjoy it. It was so lovely to have clean, quiet, comfortable place that I could relax in the evenings. It's located close to downtown, meaning that all delivery and ride share services are easily accessible. There's plenty of off-street parking in the driveway, which makes loading/unloading super quick and easy.
The house itself is newly remodeled, and the kitchen and main bedroom were particularly spacious. I especially appreciated the device chargers provided in the living room and bedroom, the gift of custom chocolates, and the wide selection of tea and accompaniments. I don't cook, but I found most everything I needed in the kitchen. The addition of a wine bottle stopper and some food storage options (zipper bags, containers with lids) would make it complete!
The main bathroom is serviceable, but quite small. There's a doorstop secured to the floor inside the bathroom that keeps the bathroom door from opening all the way...and it happens to be right in front of the rather tiny mirror mounted high above the sink. I found myself having to lean over to see myself in the mirror while getting ready, which was workable but less than ideal, and closing the door to have better access to the sink/mirror would have blocked out all natural light and made the bathroom feel claustrophobic. The water pressure in the shower was great, though the provided shampoo, conditioner, and soap appeared to need replacement as the liquids and solids of each had separated and begun to yellow. I brought my own products, so this wasn't an issue for me.
I didn't need to use the two bedrooms upstairs, but I did look at them briefly when I first arrived and found them to be in keeping with the listing.
The house has a large yard with a gorgeous deck (complete with string lights), and River had THE BEST time zooming through the fallen leaves! The yard is fenced, though there is no gate between the deck and the driveway, and lower half of the yard is uneven/steeply sloped. There also appeared to be sections that hadn't been mowed/maintained as recently as others, but that wasn't a barrier to our enjoyment - there was plenty of space for us to run and play. We were able to see and hear several neighbors working in their yards, but nothing terribly disruptive.
I hope to return to Mark's place the next time I visit my Grandma with my spouse!"

Mark takes pride in his property's by offering a very comfortable and well maintained relaxing atmosphere. Mark communicates effectively throughout your entire stay and he responds quickly to any questions you may have.
I own a company that operates in 11 states, so i deal with alot of rentals. Marks luxurious property's are responsibly priced. I have account's with multiple hotels, but moving forward... I and my employees will be staying at his property's while in the area, if they are available.
Again, if you are visiting for a sporting event, work, or just a leisure activity. Please view his property's"

Furniture was comfy, beds great, nice towels and sheets, and plenty of kitchen supplies. There were also extra touches like charging cords throughout the house, ice trays that were full and ready to use, tinfoil/saran wrap, and mints on the night stand! There is an awesome porch off the back of the house that we used briefly and will plan to use more on our visit next summer. This was a wonderful experience for our family."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for 6 nights to see our son off to Lawrence Uni.
Upon arrival, we immediately feel at home. I love the interior. I didn't know before that black and grey interior can be so appealing and light. The place was really clean.
There were phone charging station in many places and this is helpful for a family who uses gadgets frequently ; the kitchen utensils were complete which made it easy for us to cook easy meals anytime, complete amenities, coffee and several different types of coffee makers; the TV complete with Netflix etc;
We enjoyed sitting at the back terace and even saw a deer running to the woods one morning. The location was really good since being close to the park and Riverside means good walks for us.
We met Brian the owner on the first morning when he was checking on a painting being done outside the house. He was very friendly and we had a nice chat with him.
We surely would love to stay here again on our next visit."

We couldn't believe the full kitchen, it was so nice. They had everything you could need. The neighborhood was very nice and quiet. It backs up to some woods where we saw a doe and her fawns, rabbits, and other wildlife from the amazing deck out back. The place was very clean, too. The owner lives down the street and would stop by to maintain the garden, but gave us a heads up when they were stopping by. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again if we need a place in that area!"

Couple of things to be aware of: upstairs bathroom doesn’t have an exhaust fan at this time. Upstairs has a narrow staircase and a step down into the gryffindor room so if you have challenges with such things then downstairs may be a better choice. Kitchen is very modern.
Would definitely stay here again!"

We enjoyed our morning walks while looking at all the beautiful homes. The interior decor was just as pictured and had me sending videos of every nook and crany to my family members that opted out of a family getaway.
The moment we walked into the house we felt at home. Every detail was thought of with a well stocked kitchen, plenty of charging stations (great for my gaming dorks), and a cute doggie station that made me smile since we were traveling with our 4 legged good boy.
Would highly recommend a stay here and plan to return with all those jealous family members later."

From the perfect set up kitchen that included EVERYTHING a person would desire to cook with, to the linens, WiFi (including charging cables etc), iron and ironing board, washer-dryer, ice trays with ice, everything a person could need was to be found. It was a great example of why renting an AirBNB is so superior to what would be just an average hotel experience. Lots and lots of elbow room for me and my family. In addition, my son and daughter who are Harry Potter fans LOVED IT! My son even sleeping ""under the stairs in the cupboard closet"" that was hilariously set up and matched the story book to a Tee. The house would make for an incredible set suitable for a Disney theme park with velvet rope restrictions so that persons touring the famous Harry Potter home could only peer into each and every themed room that was full of fantastic artifacts.

Parking in the driveway was a breeze, cooking in the well appointed kitchen was convenient, and I explored the area on foot in all four directions of the apartment. Practically everything in the whole Appleton area was only a 7 minute drive away! This place definitely set a high bar for my future travels!"

We had a really restful stay there and it was pretty quiet. The yard was perfect for letting our dog out to run around and the driveway was very convenient to the back door for packing in and out. The house is convenient to restaurants and so it was easy to run out for a quick bite. I definitely recommend Gloria's place!"

Location is just off a main road and you can drive everywhere. The only downfall that we had was the air conditioning. You can’t control it yourself. We woke up both nights to 75-77 degrees. I did message Gloria and she quickly changed it down for us- but I’d prefer to be able to do it ourselves especially since the second night.. the settings didn’t stay or something and it was hot again. Other than that, perfect place. Cute small home. Just what we needed for our trip to EAA 🥰"

Gloria provides lots of extras that I’ve never seen in other properties. The bed was extremely comfortable along with having very nice linens and pillows. We had no kids with us but the bungalow is set up perfectly for a family; fenced in backyard with different games to play, nice bunk beds, smart TV’s and fast internet. The bathroom is small but very well stocked with everything you need. Gloria was very fast to respond to questions about the area, shopping and grocery stores. Didn’t have any questions about the bungalow because she had a notebook explaining all the things we needed to know. Thanks Gloria for letting us stay at your property and if we are in the area again we will be contacting you."

A great front porch for coffee and reading or drawing in the morning and relaxing with a cocktail in the afternoon. I would recommend staying at this sweet spot to anyone wanting to explore the Fox Cities area. **Restaurant recommendations! The Thai Ginger Bistro on West College Avenue is FANTASTIC! Fresh, flavorful dishes and excellent service. Go to here! The Copper Rock Coffee Company across from the TMA has delicious sandwiches, breakfast, coffee/tea drinks, and baked goods.

The home itself really feels like a home, much better than staying at a hotel. the price was unbeatable and for such a nice place so close to restaurants and close to Lambeau, I would highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed one night",Mike was so accommodating and let us stay at his place on very short notice. His place was clean and had everything we needed for a short stay in Appleton. Location was convenient and we appreciated all of the little touches--we didn't have to Google for places to eat or grab coffee because of his recommendations.

Stayed one night","What an excellent location! Mike's home is clean and cozy which was perfect for our short stay. It felt like a warm and welcoming home away from home. It's on a quiet road but yet very close to the main roads for easy access. The instructions for check-in and check-out were clear, the temperature of the home was comfortable, and Mike's communication was excellent. The bed is very comfortable as well! There is plenty of parking both on the street and we were able to park in the driveway as well. We would definitely stay here again!"

Family photos, space made in the fridge for your stuff next to his. I kept expecting him to emerge from the private bedroom and ask me if I wanted eggs for breakfast. We hesitantly took him up on the offer to play vinyl (great collection) and sat on the front porch and greeted neighbors as if we owned the place. Different style, but nice."

Stayed one night","Mike was friendly and a responsive host! His hospitality was excellent!
The house is his personal home that he rents to guests so it truly feels like your staying in his home, you will meet his family through the pictures on the walls and know about his personal life by invitations to life celebrations, you will discover his tastes for music and art by the records lining the wall and you will use his kitchen. It’s almost like staying at a relatives house that you’ve never met. It was a whole different experience for us but we slept well after we confirmed it wasn’t a shared space with our host. We just expected a space dedicated to guests (which has been our prior experience). It’s definitely a value stay and we have no complaints.
The bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains were so nice for keeping it dark. The neighborhood felt safe."

Cons: The cleanliness is not up to par (we found a yellow/orangish film on remotes in living area and spots of the same thing on mugs, silverware, and other dishes, as well as the fridge and freezer being cluttered and dirty). You can’t control thermostat, pictures are misleading (there is more clutter in the house than shown), overall there is just too much personal presence in the house by host (family pictures and things everywhere, food in the fridge/freezer, toiletries left in shower and bathroom, prescription medications in the open)."

Most Appleton attractions are just a 5-10 minute drive away, and there's also easy access to Oshkosh and other cities along Lake Winnebago. The TV/entertainment is hooked up to a lot of different streaming services which was a nice touch. The host was very communicative and easy to get a hold of.
Only two cons to note. One, there was hair in the shower drain when we arrived. Two, the air conditioning does not seem to reach the second floor, where the bedroom is. We stayed here in the middle of July and the second floor got uncomfortably hot, even at night. There was a ceiling fan, but we had to turn it off because it made a lot of noise."

The open kitchen and family room is the ideal layout for a social visit. The beds were very comfy.

the space under the stairs for the kids was so cute! my oldest is 10, and my youngest is 11 months, I wasn't worried about the baby choking on anything and the toys were something ""new"". my older kids really liked the monopoly game!

We were there for the weekend but my family and I are definitely looking forward to coming back for a longer period to further enjoy the area and this beautiful house.
Brittany is one of the best hosts that we have had. We are very happy with our stay"

Stayed a few nights","Brittany’s house was the perfect place to relax during Lawrence Reunion weekend. The house is very close to campus, so our rentals cars were parked in the driveway all weekend!
The house is very welcoming. Bright and airy. The kitchen/dining/living open space was great for kicking our feet up and chatting the night away. The house rules are printed in a spiral bound boom on the counter - and includes restaurant recommendations, area parks and detailed instructions for the rad coffee maker.
There were four of us in the house using three bedrooms - the beds were so comfortable, we slept really well and were refreshed for our action packed days around campus.
We will definitely stay here again when back in Appleton. Thanks Brittany!"

It was within walking distance of Lawrence University and downtown which was a huge plus for us. It was so nice to have our Lawrence student and friends come over for a reprieve from campus life. It was also a great place for me to be able to work remotely and have time to relax in the evenings.
The beds were comfy, bathrooms were spacious, and the living area/kitchen were perfect for what we needed. The neighborhood was also nice and quiet.

There is a pullout couch in the living room, but note that the bedroom has two single beds. Also note mentioning is that this is a basement apartment and does not have any windows."

Stayed a few nights","Ron and Dotty were wonderful hosts paying special attention to every detail so their guests want for nothing. Extra care was given to every detail - delightful soaps for the masculine or feminine guest, a delicious bag of gourmet coffee for the connoisseur, base stock of groceries for the weary hungry traveler, homemade blueberry jam and surprise baked items throughout the week, just to name a few. It's no wonder they are Super Hosts!
We arrived strangers but quickly felt like we were catching up with old friends.
Thank you for the wonderful stay. We felt spoiled.

Stayed a few nights","“Homey Lower-Level Apartment with Private Entrance.” Appleton, WI June 17-20, 2022
Above the kitchen sink in Ron and Dottie’s basement apartment is a plaque with a picture of perhaps 20 smiling people. The inscription speaks of family: “We may not have it all together, but together we have it all.” Short of being adopted into their clan, we could not have felt much more welcome or cared for.
The Kraus’ home looks like a page out of House Beautiful magazine. Manicured lawn and sculpted garden beckoned from the street. The interior was immaculately clean and neat-as-a-pin tidy. Tastefully decorated and comfortably furnished, we lacked nothing. Blazingly fast WiFi. Hi-Def TV and Nintendo Wii for entertainment. A softly humming Danby dehumidifier kept the air circulating for comfort.
In our reservation, we had mentioned that we were observing our 25th wedding anniversary with our family in Wisconsin. Dottie surprised us with a saucer-sized carrot cake, two silver candles and matches. How sweet!
An array of snacks awaited us on the dining table, and the refrigerator was stocked with a few basics. Cookware, tableware and utensils were ready for action.
The sturdy twin beds had high quality linens and mattresses. We slept well.
The bathroom was white-glove clean, with fluffy towels with a variety of soaps, shampoos and conditioners. Extra toothbrushes were provided for absent-minded guests.
In reading the Guest Journal entries, it became obvious that the many guest before us had similar gratitude for the generous and gracious hospitality Ron and Dottie had shown us. If AirBnB had a rating beyond SuperHosts, they surely would merit it."

We went to the Packer game and when we got home, Dottie had baked us fresh blueberry muffins for a late night snack or a treat in the morning!! Don and Dottie are amazing!

Two separate twin beds and a sofa sleeper. Private entrance with key made it convenient to come and go as necessary. Lovely couple. Great communication and concern for Covid 19. Sanitized before I came.
Only issue I had is that my cell phone kept disconnecting because space is in the basement. Have Verizon and didn't get good phone reception, but my wifi worked! Would stay again if in the area."

Due to the emergency, our ability to pack was limited . The extra toiletries were a life saver. Also, we regularly travel with our dogs. it was nice to see an airBnb actually felt dog friend and had dog friendly rules .
I am picky when it comes to cleaning. Keri's place met my high standards. I was impressed. Particularly for such a large place.
Lastly, though we did not stay long enough to fully enjoy the space, the house has some serious charm and is spacious. I loved the tub and the stained glass.

It is an older home, but has been renovated - inside and out - making it a very welcoming, attractive place. Very tastefully decorated. We appreciated the attached garage with the garage door opener on rainy days. The neighborhood is very quiet and within walking distance of Pierce Park. The streets are lined with trees, changing colors this time of year. Made for nice walks.
The house is located near a railroad track, HOWEVER there were NO loud horns or noise; just the muted sound of the train on the rails, usually lasting 30 seconds or less. It didn’t bother us.
The backyard was nice; we didn’t use it because we visited family and friends every day we were there."

We particularly enjoyed being able to share an access code to lock and unlock the door since we all would be out at separate times some days. The place was very clean, comfortable and the AC was amazing on such a warm summer weekend. The beds were very comfortable so we all slept very well and also loved having a kitchen to make breakfasts and snacks during our time. Truly one of the best airbnb’s we’ve come across."

Stayed with kids","Cozy was the exact word our daughter used when we first arrived- and she doesn't know how to read descriptions and doormats yet : ) The first thing we did upon entering was go straight to the back window because we saw a flock of beautiful birds in the tree. Eating meals by the window to bird watch was one highlight of our stay. Our 3 little kiddos enjoyed exploring the fenced in backyard with beautiful plants starting to show. Since it rained often during our stay we treated the kids to hot cocoa from the Keurig and had many snuggly places around the home to choose from for book read alouds. The kids especially were drawn to hanging out in the upstairs- fit well for 2 sleepers- with little nooks for rest time. The train was very close by which was loud during the night but enjoyable for the kids to see during the day. Everything was very well kept and thoughtfully placed, including comfy blankets and tableware for little eaters. Highly recommended place."

We ended up getting hit with a crazy snowstorm during our weekend, but Yee was so helpful in communicating about snow removal and responding to all my questions very promptly. The house was adorable, very private, and on a quiet street. I especially appreciated the little touches like having plenty of extra blankets for us and lots of cookware to use for our meals. Overall, we had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay here!"

The home was updated, well-maintained, and had wonderful features like new appliances, large washer & dryer, smart TV comfortable bedding, and lots of places to sit and relax. We visited in the winter while visiting family in Green Bay and attending the game (GO PACK GO!!), but we all would love to visit during other times of the year as this place is in a fantastic location!"

The place is very close to everything we needed - gas, food, fun things to do, and there was even an easy route for us to take a jog in the morning to the river and nearby parks. The house was very clean and well stocked with supplies like soap, towels, extra blankets, and coffee. There were even board games upstairs. It's also super cute and well decorated. It was also nice to have separate AC units in the upstairs and downstairs to control temperature. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we found the beds and pillow upstairs quite uncomfortable (extremely firm, including pillows)."

Stayed a few nights","Great AirBNB and perfect walking distance to Mile of Music/Downtown.
Very clean, modern, minimalist. The bedding was very nice with pillows that offer a variety of options; no matter if you like your pillow soft or hard. A lot of blankets which I truly appreciated as I get cold often.
The rooms were small but adequate. There is only 1 bathroom and it’s very small. Can be chaotic and stressful with more than 2 people or more than 1 woman.
A train is nearby but otherwise we got very good sleep at night. The lock on the front door can be tedious, confusing and frustrating so we used the garage door opener for the remainder of our stay (keeping it in our truck).
Yee was very communicative, attentive and little personal touches to make us feel welcome and comfortable. We had everything we needed for our stay. The checkout process was by far the easiest and quickest compared to every AirBNB we have stayed at. Thank you Yee!"

The location is perfect (easily accessible to the highway and so a great home base for the area) yet very quiet neighborhood with grocery and other stores close by. The home is very charming, incredibly clean and everything is new and there are obvious upgrades to the home (cabinets, appliances, fresh paint, linens etc). Yee was one of the best communicators, in an AirBnB host, that I have ever experienced. She was very attentive and helpful when we had questions. The twin bed area in the upstairs loft was a highlight. Very kid friendly space and perfect for kids who want their own area to relax. the kitchen is big and beautiful - the eating area is very specious. We absolutely loved this stay. thank you Yee!"

The house was clean and the beds were comfy. There was a highchair, pack & play and several toys/books to keep my grandson entertained. It worked out great for our one night stay. The only negative is the road noise but that is disclosed in the listing and the reviews that it is on a busy street so it was to be expected. Just something to keep in mind if that bothers anyone.

Plenty of space for all the boys and Melissa had a nice stockpile of toys and books that worked for all ages. We actually found that on our first afternoon there, the boys were all completely happy to just play with the new toys they had access to rather than have to go somewhere else. The kitchen has everything you would need for cooking and cleaning up. The location was great with a fantastic park about a five minute walk away to the north and the Building for Kids Museum a mile down the road (we walked and it took about 20 minutes), the grocery store was also just a quick five minute drive so even though we brought a cooler and groceries, we were able to pick up a couple other things quickly and would probably just not bring anything at all next time to save space in the car."

Stayed with kids","This was a great landing space for our one night stay to get to the Appleton airport, which is a 10 minute drive. Melissa was by far one of the most responsive, communicative and hospitable hosts in our history of staying at various AirBnB properties. In addition to super clear instructions for everything, she went above and beyond in ensuring we had what we needed for our littlest one. There was a closet full of toys that made our two little ones really enjoy their stay. Thank you, Melissa for your hospitality and a lovely stay!"

We have 2 young children (3 and 1) and everything we needed for them was provided. It was great to not have to think about packing all the odds and ends kids need. Will definitely be on our list if we are ever in the area again!

Bedrooms are really nice and the mattresses are SUPER comfy. It’s in a quiet, central location.

Great antiquing nearby and close to restaurants and grocery stores. The Thai Ginger Bistro so close by got my husband's approval. Make sure you check out Happy Bellies Bakery if you are gluten free so yummy! The nearby town of Neenah has a wonderful glass museum. I can't wait to come back and enjoy another visit.

There was a pleasant area to sit and watch tv or play board games should one choose to, or look out the large window of the dining room to a well kept backyard which had a lovely garden, hammock, and outdoor seating should one choose to sit outside. Both bedrooms had ample space in the closet for clothing and such. There was also a daybed in the 2nd living area should an extra sleeping space be needed. A very kid friendly house if one should have kids and the house is located near to supermarkets, pharmacy, laundromat, restaurants and also the mall. Also, we were able to park our vehicle safely on the driveway leading up to the garage at the rear of the house. We wholeheartedly would recommend this home and would stay here again should we come back to Appleton."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at Mark’s place while in town for a soccer tournament. The house is conveniently located to seemingly everything (just ten minutes to the soccer park, a walk to the shops and restaurants on College Avenue and 25 minutes to High Cliff State Park). It was also just the right size for our family of four. There was one small repair needed during our stay so I messaged Mark, who replied immediately and had a repairman to the house the very next morning. Very much appreciated! We also appreciated the access to laundry in the basement, the Roku box connected to the TV in the living room and the cute drawing room off the upstairs bedroom. The house is an old house, with a lot of charm, and many recent updates. It kept us comfortable for our two days in Appleton!"

I was there for several days and it was nice to have laundry facilities available. I would definitely stay at this house again next time I am in Appleton."

The fireplace was set up and ready for a fire and the furniture was very comfortable and easy to relax in. We saw deer and geese out by the river and the view was just spectacular! The bathroom even has a heated floor and really well thought out, motion activated “nightlight” that I found very cool and will be adding to my bathroom remodel! Amy was super accommodating with our unfortunate changes in travel times and all around very responsive to any questions we had along the way. Because I have so much family in the area I will be back, and this is where I’ll want to stay!"

Amy truly goes above and beyond when it comes to creating a peaceful, serene, and cozy home away from home. Her property is genuinely undersold when it comes to quality and value.
Amy's communication and dedication to a good stay is unmatched.
She could charge any price to stay at this property and I would pay it. 11/10 recommend."

Stayed about a week","Wonderful return visit to this very special cabin. It's so close to everything, yet somehow once you turn into the drive you are almost instantly transformed to being in the north woods. Magic! The cabin is very comfortable and well stocked, including a full kitchen, and completely met our needs with great special touches like the deck of cards we used outside on the deck. The pocket screen door is awesome; even when inside the cabin, you can leave the front door open and feel like you're outside in nature! Sadly, I ran out of time to use the kayak. haha Next visit! There was a very impressive moon shining over the river on my last night. If you want to be close to everything yet have peace and privacy in tranquil nature, this is for you!Finally, super host Amy is so warm, friendly, and responsive - from quickly answering questions to just letting you know how much she cares that you have a good stay. This is a wonderful place to stay with truly nice and caring hosts"

Definitely a great place to be close to town!

It feels like the north woods - so private and peaceful - but it is actually conveniently located to everything going on in the area. A real gem. Beautiful views from inside the cabin and outside on the wrap decks. Every amenity I wanted and then some: a fully stocked kitchen (even cinnamon for my coffee), a comfy bed with extra blankets, super comfortable chairs inside and outside on the deck, and a fireplace for chilly days. I will have to use the grill and kayaks next time! Hanging out in the morning with coffee, a fire, and the water views was beyond relaxing. A work area with views and good Internet service made keeping up with home and email easy during my stay. Unique touches everywhere. Did I mention it is Peaceful?! Finally, Super Host Amy was friendly, helpful, and very responsive to questions. This is my new go to when in the Appleton area!"

The host undersells the property. Amy has gone over and above in almost every aspect of this BnB. Extremely functional and convenient. Her interior decorating goes even further in making you feel comfortable and cozy. I stayed in late December, right after a decent snow. The driveway and walkways were perfectly kept (even upon my midnight arrival). If you are looking for a warm and cozy winter getaway for some R&R, this is your place. Imagine making a fire in the indoor fireplace, and drinking coffee while sitting in world's comfiest recliner. All while watching it snow onto the frozen river out of the window next to you. This is what paintings are made of. Would 10/10 recommend staying here."

The house has recently been re-decorated, so everything is shiny and new. I enjoyed sitting at the dining table, or at the table outdoors on the deck, and watching the river go by.
Loved ending my day with a kayak ride up the river.
The hosts have helpfully made a list of nearby grocery stores if you want to cook for yourself in the lovely kitchen, or nearby restaurants if you'd rather not cook.
The host was very responsive when I had a question.
I was concerned that road noise might be an issue, as maps show the house near a main road, but the house is down a slope from the road, and the road is not busy, so I never heard traffic noise. It was especially quiet at night.
A fabulous river getaway."
