Stayed with a pet","Pictures on the listing are accurate. The place was clean and offered VERY basic necessities. Needed dish towels, dish sponges, soap& paper towels for basic clean up amongst some other household items.
Communication during check in was sub par. Messages and various phones calls were left unanswered. Due to late check in was late to a wedding reservation that was planned months in advance.
Overall experience was okay. First impressions are important and lack of communication was disappointing."

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie was very kind but the house had limited amenities we were not prepared for. There was only one hand soap for all 3 sinks, no dish soap, no towels and one of the bathrooms did not have a trash bin. There was no paper towels or napkins in the entire house but Stephanie responded quickly and brought some over.
The house was “fairly” clean, there was dust and random trash we found.
Note: There is no microwave and not all the outlets work . There is no WiFi in the house, but you are able to access the neighbors WiFi in small areas but this was not a feasible solution."

Group trip","Everything was clean, enough parking, big enough to even bring an air mattress. I would say just a few maybe could haves but not a show stopper.
The kitchen area could use a sink area, small tables in rooms to be able to put luggage, more towels and lastly some mirrors in rooms. It did save me she had shampoo and conditioner after getting my hair done and all the hairspray my small travel size was not going to be enough. She saved the day!
Overall I would stay again when I come back and visit."

Stayed one night","I’m not going to lie I felt a bit sketchy being that it looked like a warehouse, but I got persuaded by the reviews that were left and decided to give it a try. Let me tell you I didn’t regret it at all. She was super responsive, communicated well, overall felt like home away from home. Also, it was awesome to find a place to stay that was in Roma, Tx. Normally we have to stay 30+ away from where we are trying to go. It was a street away from the funeral home."

Stayed one night",It was a great comfortable place for an overnight stay. We only used it for one night but it was comfortable. She had it nice and cool when we got there which was great being that we were in the heat all day long. It was clean and cozy. Me and my son enjoyed the overnight stay and even enjoyed the friendly neighborhood cats 😁 I wouldn't mind staying again but hopefully next time it will be a little longer stay. I actually enjoyed the pace not having a tv as it felt nice just talking and enjoying time with my son.

Stayed one night","Booked this AirBnB at the last minute while on a road trip. Was able to contact the host and get into the place very quickly after booking, and was greeted by a really sweet and friendly cat upon arrival. The RV was cozy, clean, and had a small kitchen and a nice shower. Basic kitchen equipment- silverware, bowls, plates, cups, 2 cooking spoons, one sharp knife and one small pan- no can opener or oil/spices so be sure to get your own if needed. There were no bath towels provided but we had our own. A/C units worked really well and kept the place cool. Overall great stay for an unbeatable price, would stay again."

Stayed a few nights",This home is a little bit older with a few rough edges but very enjoyable. The hosts worked very hard to resolve our few minor concerns about needed linen and a bright backyard light. We lost water pressure but it was a city problem not the home and hosts were prepared to step in if needed. Would definitely stay again. Good communication and comfortable beds. Be aware there is some dog noise at times during the sleep hours but the hosts can't do much about that. One of the bedrooms has no windows and you can block out the dog barking sounds.

Stayed a few nights","The only bathroom in the small home was in a master bedroom so if there is a third quest in the house as I was, I had to go through the bedroom for showering and toiletry.
The pull out sofa bed was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in. Only a fitted sheet was provided.for a mattress without support. I had to contact owner for cover sheet.
There were no washcloths for use to clean with. The owner said she would get is some but then refused to follow up.
The shower curtain fell twice. The shower stall was very small and cramped.
There were no spoons in the kitchen and only plastic forks and spoons.
The outside sitting area was nice.
I would recommend this only for a couple or a couple with child.
The owner did provide us with extra coffee kcups.
I would myself not return. In my opinion, far from a super host cottage."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic 2 night stay at Rancho Lomitas!
From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the wonderful Anna who is a permanent resident there I knew we had made the right choice.
Our spacious casitas (number 3) was immaculate and the sheer quality of the fixtures and fittings took us by surprise to be truthful.
During our stay there we just birded around the ranch seeing some great birds including Audubon's Oriole, Pyrrhuloxia and White-tailed Hawk.
Toni the host is a lovely person, very knowledgeable and was on hand to chat too so all in all Rancho Lomitas ticked all of the boxes for us, brilliant accommodation in a fantastic setting and some wonderful conversations particularly with Anna!"

I enjoyed my weekend there by a 30 mi bike ride on Saturday and walking at the Ranch on Sunday . Visiting the local nursery with many rare and unique native plants was the additional premium to my trip . I got a lot of plants for my house and backyard.

This is a wonderful retreat—perfect for unwinding, exploring nature, or for creatives wanting some quiet solitude to work. Outside, Toni has created a special environment full of native plants, butterflies, and all kinds of unique birds (literally a vibrant red, green, etc.). Inside, the unit is spacious, cool, immaculately clean, and perfectly stocked with everything you need. At night, the sky is packed with stars. It's a little oasis in the South Texas brush country. If you are commuting into Rio Grande City, as I was daily (I stayed two weeks), expect a 25-minute drive each way and a good stretch of bumpy dirt and gravel roads. It's well worth it for the comfort, beauty and peace of the ranch."

Very quiet neighborhood. You basically have what you need in every room. Kitchen had working Fridge, stove/oven, microwave, good coffee maker, plates, cups and cooking wear as well as a high chair if needed for the little one.
Washer & Dryer worked great. Restroom had towels, complementary shampoo, etc. and hair dryer.
Rooms: beds are Very Comfortable along with the pillows, blankets and plenty of closet space.
Living room: Good size tv, Enough space & plenty of sofa pillows. There is a work desk for your laptop.
All rooms have a ceiling fan and the AC work great.
Location was awesome: (less then 1/2 mile) you have Walmart, H-E-B, Churches Chicken, Starbucks, Whataburger, Chick-fil-A, Panda Express and Peter Piper Pizza. And that’s just a few to list.
Overall our stay here had been pretty good and Definitely will return and stay here again.

Maria's apartment is not only beautifully decorated but also incredibly comfortable. The attention to detail in the decor and furnishings really stood out, and it's clear that Maria has put a lot of thought and care into creating a welcoming and cozy space. The apartment is spacious and well-lit, with a great layout that makes it feel open and inviting.
One thing that truly impressed me was the level of cleanliness in the apartment. Everything was spotless, and it was evident that Maria goes to great lengths to maintain a high standard of hygiene. It's reassuring to stay in a place where cleanliness is a top priority."

For checking in, there was no description with the code or specific apt number so it was unknown which apt was the airbnb. I had to have my husband call for the owner to pick up to share the code with us so we could get inside. the lock is a little funky and will get jammed sometimes and not work so we had to play with it to get inside."
