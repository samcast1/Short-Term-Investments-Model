Stayed one night","From the get-go, Ben was attentive and informative about all aspects of our stay. As to the property, we had a very clean and spacious room, nice coffee with creamers, bottled waters in the fridge, good WIFI and TV...so I knew we had a thoughtful host! Add end tables and electrical outlets where they're needed...and I thought - this makes sense! Finish with a generous supply of clean towels, and fresh linens and soft pillows on the very large bed (which seemed much larger than king sized)...and I appreciated that everything in the environment advanced the experience of comfort. We rested well and would certainly return to Ben's again!"

I booked the same day and he was responsive. He's certainly attentive to details with parking clearly marked on the street, informing guests of the walk up the hill and stairs into the space, and including earplugs for the possible noise in the home. The bed was very comfortable and there were different types of pillows, too!"

I applaud yall for having quality toilet paper. One of my pet peeves is most these airbnb's use crappy tp trying to save a dime or two. I ALWAYS take my own Cottonelle toilet paper everywhere I go. I rate this place a 5/5 stars. God Bless."

Ben sent me all the details I needed to find the house and the private entrance a day or two before my trip, and was super accommodating of my very late arrival. I didn’t do much but slept there, so the super comfy king-size bed was perfect for me. Check-out was super easy too. The whole experience was flawless, which allowed me to focus on my class. If I had occasion to visit Columbia again I’d definitely stay here again."

Thankfully this place was perfect for us after being on the road all day driving. We were so very grateful to walk in with the A/C already set to a very comfortable temperature on an extremely hot day. We felt relaxed and very welcomed to this space and our hosts communicated with us throughout the drive down and ensured we were taken care of. Spotlessly clean, private.... you are getting an absolute bargain for the price. As the listing states, there are steps and a hill to walk up but it's not bad at all so don't let that deter you from a relaxing, comfortable and affordable stay. Would love to stay again and next time under happier circumstances, and to have longer to enjoy the area and space."

The only thing that might bother others, though I did not mind at all, was that in the room you can hear the family in the evening and morning when getting ready for school. It is not load but is still there which they are open about in their description.
I would definitely stay here again when visiting Columbia. It is not walking distance to down town but it is so close and for the price savings it is always worth it."

The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean with great water pressure in the shower. The upstairs is insulated well, which was nice since it was chilly outside and on the steps. Stephen was quick to respond to any questions I had and accommodating when i requested to extend my stay by one more day. Would definitely stay here again!"

His beautiful property is located in a serene neighborhood right off of a main road that has plenty of dining and shopping options (note: you can get a great breakfast at Eggs Up Grill right down the road). We highly recommend this room at the top of the stairs and hope to stay there again the next time we come to town.

His room was lovely and extremely kept up. He made sure we were accommodated for anything we needed and tried his best to make the checkin process go as smoothly as possible. The only issue was our GPS that sent us to the bank behind his house. Other than that, I 100% recommend Stephen being your host in Columbia, South Carolina."

His place is clean, comfortable, and I felt the most at home I ever have while traveling for work. Stephen made special accommodations for parking as I am extremely OCD about my SUV, and was kind enough to refund my money from when I was supposed to stay at his place the previous week and ended up having to go home due to a family emergency. My only regret is not finding the room at the top of the stairs sooner!"

Very responsive. Would definitely stay here again. Was within 10 minutes of Fort Jackson which was great for us.

His son (I believe) was really nice and helped me open the door to get in without any hesitation, because my hands were full. I would most definitely recommend to anyone looking for a SAFE area with a great host!"

Comfortable bed and appreciated the white noise machine - I use one each night and forgot to pack mine! Shower is good pressure and didn’t run out of hot water. Everything we needed!

The greeter cat was a nice touch. :) We didn't utilize the microwave or toaster oven but we did use the keurig and it worked just fine. It would also be a great place for someone working nights and sleeping days because the room darkening shades block out the light nicely.

Touches such as the keurig, toaster oven, microwave and large mini-frig would make it comfortable for several nights as well. The neighborhood is beautiful and was easy to get in and out of. Next time I might keep what I need for the night separate when stopping through with a large suitcase just to make it easier getting up and down the stairs but it really wasn’t a big deal. The bed and the futon were both comfortable. I like a bed a bit on the firmer side and the pillow I chose was goose down and perfect! My daughter likes a softer bed and felt the futon was very comfortable! If my daughter chose to go to school in Columbia I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","We spent a night at Lizzi&Scott’s place from 3/2 to 3/3. Overall I’m not satisfied with this experience but I’d like to be honest.
Cons:
We didn’t expect too much about the size but it was really tiny… the pictures on the profile didn’t capture the layout of the whole unit. It only accommodates a queen bed and you have to use the foldable chair and table if you want to eat something.
Ventilation was bad. No openable windows. AC is old and noisy. It doesn’t work well to keep the place dry.
A food container was left in the microwave. A mug was unwashed with some sugar like residues. We found a stink bug on the wall.
Pros:
The hosts are very communicative
They left some snacks. I really appreciate that.
They made a good guidebook for some local restaurants and events
The location is good."

Stayed one night","The listing clearly states ""Tiny Guest House"", so the hosts are being honest & transparent, but nonetheless I was a bit surprised how small it was--about the same amount of room as a New York City hotel room. The (quite comfortable) bed takes up 90% of the space, so if you've got much luggage you'll be stepping over things. As stated in the listing, the shower and toilet are a couple of feet away from the bed and not private AT ALL--it's a small space and there are no walls, doors or anything separating the bed from the shower / toilet area. If the weather is nice you can work/read/eat outside on the patio, but otherwise you'll have no choice but to do everything in bed, there is no inside work/eating/reading space. This listing is best for one person traveling alone (as I was) or for two people who are REALLY comfortable around one another!! Off street parking was plentiful, and the location is walkable to restaurants, etc.."

Stayed one night","I wanted a quiet peaceful space for one night. I didn't even know they had a dog (I'm afraid/terrified) until checkout. The cutest thing was so quiet and didn't bark (not that I could hear) all night. They were very proactive with communication. I didn't really need anything except a can opener which was waiting for me at check-in. Cute ,small,quiet cottage right behind their home=spot on description. About the same space as a decent hotel room. Overall great stay."

Stayed one night","We loved the cozy cottage vibe. Perfect for my husband and I one night get away to explore Columbia. The garden was lovely with the pink azaleas in full bloom. The TV was easy to use, the air conditioner was new and only a gentle hum, like my ""white noise"" machine. The whole room was well thought out, even had a refrigerator with snacks that we enjoyed while watching TV, and bathroom esentials. My favorite memory will be my husband singing in the shower, thanks to a sign above the shower encouraging him to do so! There is a divider screen available for privacy that we didn't need to use, but may be nice for other couples as the bathroom is in the room. Very close to everything in the city but feels like a private oasis! My only caution is the walkway stepstones may not be for someone with poor walking ability."

Stayed one night","This place is cute & a perfect little retreat! I loved the attention to detail, easy check in, and the snacks!
And for fellow anxious parking babes like me, I was hesitant to book this place due to street parking. However, there was ample street parking and it was easy! I was able to park right in front of the house, no maneuvering into a tiny spot between cars necessary. 👍🏻💜 The street was safe, even though I arrived late and parked around 9 pm.
My only “heads up” advice for future travelers would be to pack some earplugs or headphones if you need quiet for sleep. The A/C unit is powerful and cool, but also very loud.
Overall, this is a great location for a short visit to Columbia! I walked over to Curiosity Coffee for coffee and breakfast in the morning and it was just lovely. I was also relieved to see that this seemed to be a safe and inclusive area. It’s hard to travel as an LGBTQ person in our current climate, but our hosts and everyone I met made me feel so welcome. 🌈"

Stayed one night","A small but cozy place packed in with a lot of items a guest might need such as microwave, coffee maker, small hotel size refrigerator with bottle waters, sodas, and lots of snacks, etc.
Sink, toilet and shower are not separated into another room. Photo shows partition to hide toilet but it’s “open” to bed area.
There is no room for dining area inside. Only dining area is outside which is fine on a nice day like the day we were there. Cozy courtyard in front to hang out.
A lot of other items stocked such as flashlights, umbrellas, can opener, scissors, hand-held mirror as well as few wall mirrors.
They did a good job to make a small room into functional space for overnight guests.
Very helpful and prompt response to recommendations for places to eat for special occasion."

They had everything I needed to get on the road the next day quickly after a great night's sleep. The snacks were awesome - I had a long flight and drive to get to SC, so it was nice to have some snacks on hand so I didn't have to run out to a store or get dinner. Thanks for a great stay!"

If there had been anything they didn’t think to provide, I’m sure they would have brought it. You can tell they really care about making it a good experience. The neighborhood is vibrant and friendly and a really fun place to walk or bike around, filled with beautiful homes and lush gardens. There is a great park with a playground and splash pad a couple blocks away, and a 10 minute walk will take you to several great coffee shops and restaurants plus a cool local market. Very close drive to zoo and museums. Overall, fantastic place to stay and would highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","On a quiet historic neighborhood of Columbia… if you want to be close to the highway, close to the universities but be closed to hard working families that say hello, as you walk the street or any other formalities than this is the place for you. The bathroom is small but standing shower is AMAZIN. The bed was incredible and the being on corner between two streets just provided a level of safety and awareness."

Stayed a few nights","I had a short stay for business, so I was only in the unit overnight. If you are planning on being, there during the day, might have a different experience. I did not use the kitchen other than the microwave and the refrigerator and did not use the TV
I want to list some pros and cons to make this an accurate review. Always take a good look at the images.
Pros:
The location is a close drive to everything in the city.
The bed was extremely comfortable.
The shower is just as nice as you expect it to be from the pictures.
The check in and entry process they use is very convenient.
The stocked Keurig station was a really nice touch.
Cons:
You need to make sure your cell phone stays charged in order to access the unit if you are using the suggested method.
Other than the shower, the bathroom is very small. The commode and sink can be difficult to work around.
Because it is an older house, it is hard to find outlets for items like hairdryers and styling tools.
This is a first-floor unit. You will hear things happening on the second floor.
Overall, a good stay."

Stayed a few nights","My 4 hour stay here was very disappointing to say the least. After a hours long drive, I laid on the couch and turned on the television. None of the channels came in consistently clear but I didn't complain. I went to take a shower so I could go get a bite to eat. The shower was terrible. There was no real flow or pressure and the water was not hot enough. But im a big boy, I weathered through. As I returned from a restaurant, I had to urinate badly. I couldn't get in the door. A few minutes later, the host gave me a door code to get in but by that time I was jumping around with a full bladder with one of the neighbors watching me suspiciously while asking 'can i help you? Who do you know over here? (Im Black and the community is White). I finally enter the unit and sat back on the couch. As I sat there, I saw 2 bees enter the unit from the crack in the top front door. Since I will be here for days, I couldn't just let them roam so I killed one and was stung in my top lip by the other (see pictures). That was the last straw. I informed the host that I was checking out after 4 hours. I paid for 4 days. The bee that stung me is still in there I presume. I'm requesting a full refund for this experience. The host is refusing my refund"

However, bathroom door does not close, it is difficult to sit on the toilet due to an extremely confined space(and I am a small person, refrigerator was a bit dirty inside and outside, and the driveway to the parking area was horrible! I drove as slowly as I could, but still hit because it was steep and had a low area in the middle that needs to be filled in. It rained a lot while we were there, so the parking area was very messy because it is dirt/sand."

Stayed a few nights","I was looking to escape the winter of the Chicagoland area and do some hiking in Congaree National Park and in looking for a place to stay, I happened upon Gustavo and Barbara‘s place and what a find it was. It 100% met my expectations based on their listing. I loved the neighborhood where it’s located with all the unique homes and many coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. I even walked to the University of South Carolina’s basketball game against Kentucky. They’ve done a wonderful job preparing a great spot for individuals, couples and couples with one or two small children. After long days of hiking, I looked forward to coming back to relax at their place, walk to another locally recommended restaurant and then get a good night’s sleep. They were always very prompt in responding to any questions that I had. I really enjoyed my time in Columbia and I’m very seriously considering coming back for a football game in the fall and if I do, my first choice to stay will be at Gustavo and Barbara’s place."

From the start, we walked in to a pristine environment but also there was a greeting card, some sweet treats and water bottles. The air was flowing so it felt great and there were just so many thoughtful details throughout the entire place. Also, the beds were comfortable!! So often beds are rock hard. Not these. And I even took a picture of the bedding because the comforter was so nice. There are also 2 options of bedding in case you prefer a fluffy or non fluffy version.
I was in town for a football camp with my son. We arrived late. We felt safe the entire time. Also the entry was a breeze. They were even thoughtful enough to customize the code to us so it was easy to remember.
If you are in town, this place is absolutely something you should book!"

I had one accommodation needed and the hosts provided me with it, with no problem whatsoever. I was able to enjoy more of the house this time around and I’m glad that I got that opportunity. My guests also enjoyed themselves. The extra television was and is always a plus. It kept my guests occupied while they waited for food. Hosts are responsive and helpful and very hospitable.

The only down side was the sofa bed which was not very comfortable. But it was described in the listing so that’s not the hosts fault. Sofa beds just are not as comfortable as a bed! It would be an ideal stay for 2 or 3 people where someone could sleep on the couch instead of the sofa bed but it’s very doable with 4 people. Everything was very cute and clean and we would love to stay here again!

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely LOVE this cutie of a home! The location was easy to find, close to essentials and in a super quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Once inside it felt like a hug soul hug! So many unique touches and aspects to this place!! By far the most amazing Air BnB experience I’ve ever had. The most ideal space for short or long stays.
I WILL be a repeat guest! One particular aspect for me was that it is absolutely perfect for parents of furry four legged children! The fenced yard is a rare and needed convenience.
Can’t express enough how amazing the experience was!!! Thanks Sarah! We’ll be back!"

Filled with every little toiletry you could ever need :) The fenced in backyard was perfect for my 2 pups, and we all really enjoyed our time here. Sarah was a super friendly and generous host. She offered early check in and late check out, which I really appreciated! Will def book again if I can."

This place is also conveniently close to Fort Jackson so when I went to go visit my husband for his graduation/family day I was only 10 mins away and had no issue getting there! Cynthia provides snacks and water which was great because I had forgotten to buy drinks when I arrived! The shower is amazing! Also she provides a hair dryer with a diffuser! Overall I would recommend this place! It was an amazing stay and Cynthia is very friendly and a great communicator!"

Stayed a few nights","Farmhouse Chic in the City is a lovely, roomy place to stay when visiting Cola. A private driveway, entrance way, suite, and bath were convenient, chic, and clean.
The owner communicated well and provided a helpful list of things to see, do, eat…although our stay was mostly focused around University of South Carolina activities (Go Cocks!).
A good list of amenities prevented us from having to tote those things on the flight down or run out and buy.
Farmhouse Chic in the City is close to major highways, but is tucked back in a cute neighborhood, which was peaceful and quiet.
We can’t recommend this place enough!
Thanks Cynthia for opening your home to ABnB. We plan to visit again, when next we visit."

Very clean and stylish. Water pressure for shower was great. And the keyless entry was simple. Cynthia left me some snacks and coffees. Loved it. For me the location was perfect.""
Thanks so much!"

Stayed a few nights",I recommend this location if you're in the area. The place was very clean and more spacious than I was expecting. The photos were accurate to what we experienced and the nightly price helped keep our trip to the Carolinas and Tennessee in budget. There were so many little details that made our stay better.. there was even a sound machine which I was so happy to see because I had forgotten mine. It was quiet at night and close to a lot of attractions.

The location worked well for me because my first priority was Congaree Natl Park, but it's a ways away from downtown and all."

Refrigerator does not make ice. This is the most disappointing experience we have ever encountered. It was a nice size apartment but we could not stay there. Quite neighborhood and good location for our visit.
