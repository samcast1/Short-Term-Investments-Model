Stayed with kids","Beautiful home in a very quiet, nice, and safe neighborhood. Huge back yard for our kids to play in between our trips to the surrounding state parks along with a nice play room they converted from part of the garage. The whole house was prefect inside and out. It had everything we could need for our week long stay and more. We couldn't be happier. I would suggest this home to anyone. From a long stay wanting to explore NW Ok. to a weekend stay for a quick trip."

Stayed with kids","Clean and cute home! Close to main roads of Woodward and only a few minutes from groceries, restaurants, and gas stations. Quiet neighborhood. House was pristine! The yard is large and has a tall privacy fence all the way around it. Comfortable outdoor furniture though it was too chilly for us to enjoy it. Had all kitchen basics as far as dishes, pots and pans, utensils, etc. The bonus room (converted single car garage) was a nice additional space for kids to play-lots of board games and a tv. Bedrooms were spacious. Everything seemed very new-the windows, carpet, flooring, etc. We enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed with a pet","The house was clean and spacious and booking was easy. However, the location was very, odd! We had to drive behind a motel (with what looked to have long term residents) to access the house. Pictures ,while booking, seemed to make the house look secluded but it was not. We were also not able to use backyard because the grass was so tall. It was ok and served our purpose."

The home is well appointed and superbly furnished ... we felt at home immediately and it was a convenient location for our requirements.
Sitting outside to read was a joy in both the front and back yards, the area is very quiet.
Overall, one of the best Airbnb rentals we've ever enjoyed anywhere in the world.
Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","This was our second stay. The first stay was two years ago. At the time, the place looked like new. Two years later, it still looked new. Super clean and comfortable. Ashley was always quick to respond and was easy to work with. My only negative is that the house is on a narrow, dead end street. The person directly in front of the driveway parks an RV in the street. This makes it a little (very) hard to get in and out - especially if you have a trailer (UHaul) like we did."

Stayed a few nights",Impeccable response time for when I was traveling and needed a place to stay sane day (short notice). Gave me everything I needed to know about the property and was openly communicating with me as to weather or not I needed anything (I did not). Which makes it all the more better because we had everything we could have needed. 5 stars!

No problems ever arose but whatever I needed they would always go out of their way to make sure I was happy and enjoying my stay. From bringing me food to inviting me to the annual rodeo I became close to them. This place was worth every penny! During my stay I even picked up gardening after they purchased some seeds and taught me which was extremely relaxing after a long days work. If you are reading this make the right choice while in Woodward and stay at Lola’s!"

The house is beautifully accommodated. A very comfortable and soothing environment. The worst thing about it, was we were there for work and didn’t spend near enough time enjoying the tranquility of the home. Highly recommend! We will definitely be back."

The washer and dryer are a super plus. So nice to not have to find a laundromat!
The bed in the master bedroom was also a pleasant surprise. It is a kingsize memory foam that is extremely comfortable.

Our two month stay at Lola’s on Maple was not only comfortable and convenient, it was the beginning of a great friendship. Ronda, Bob and Anna go above and beyond great hospitality and will do anything to help out. Their knowledge of places to eat, things to do, great dog groomers, nail salons, a storage place nearby (for our motorcycles) and a notary. You name it, they can help!
We loved the location of the house, everything was so convenient to get to. The living room is nice and open. The bedrooms are cozy, beds are comfortable. The large, fenced-in backyard was our favorite place to hang out. It’s a great place to cook out, let the animals run and visit with friends.
If you want a great place in Woodward- look no further than Lola’s on Maple!"

From the moment we stepped through the door, we were enveloped in coziness and cleanliness. It's evident that the hosts take great pride in maintaining this space to the highest standards.
Having experienced our fair share of Airbnb stays, we can attest that it's rare to find a place that feels as fresh and inviting as this one. There's a tangible sense of care and attention to detail that permeates every corner of the property. Despite staying here twice in the span of 15 months, the place feels just as pristine as the first time we arrived.
The hosts have clearly invested in not only maintaining the space but also in continually enhancing it. We noticed subtle improvements, from new linens to an even better-stocked kitchen, which made our stay comfortable and convenient.
Overall, we cannot recommend this Airbnb highly enough."

House is very clean and spacious, and the location is great, close to stores, markets, and restaurants.

Stayed with kids","Quiet neighborhood, nicely decorated without clutter but not sterile either. All essentials were available in the kitchen which made cooking in easy. Beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room to lounge around the living room and sit at the kitchen table comfortably. I failed at double checking the check out time and while I wouldn't suggest taking advantage of Christina, she was graceful with me leaving a wee past check out time. She was very kind in her communication and there was nothing complicated or stressful about the stay. The backyard has plenty of room to let kiddos run around or to lounge around by yourself. Will stay here again when we pass through."

Communication was lacking in the beginning, we didn't get the key code until after check-in when I messaged host upon arriving. Communication improved when an issue came up and host took care of it by quickly. Shower head is low, my tall husband had to bend down significantly or wash on his knees. Nice backyard which my toddler enjoyed."

Stayed a few nights","Robin is an excellent host. We were there for a business trip and brought a crew with us. This is the second time we have stayed there. For checkin, He noticed that I was having difficulty locating the information I needed and was there to assist before I called. He was prompt, gracious, and happy to show us around without being invasive .
As to the property itself- it was just as it appears in the photos, kind of a community house with lots of bedrooms and a large open space for gatherings. There is something not shown in the photos but a great help to us- Robin had several large tables and chairs (like you might find at a community center) which were great for us as we could all spread out for work and a mini conference session.
There was a large tv with good access in the main room, as well as tv's in each bedroom. This made it really nice for us.
After two visits, this is our ""go to"" location when we are in town.
HIGHLY recommend for budget accommodations.

The main trash bags were not much larger than a standard grocery sack, shower nozzle in master didn’t work, shower only sprayed extremely hot water that couldn’t seem to be adjusted, the guest bath has no shower, the internet was not good at all and ended up going out completely for a full day. The cleaning fee was excessive in my opinion for the town and size of the house. The house can be a great place to stay but not happy with how it is run."

Stayed one night","If you're coming to Woodward and need something a bit more posh, this is your stay. There are 3 bedrooms and 1.5 baths. Each bedroom as at minimum a double bed, I'm not sure if the loveseat in the master is also a sleeper.
You will need to bring your own coffee, tea, or breakfast as this is just a B without the second B. There's an ample amount of bedding, pillows, and extra blankets. Toiletries outside hand soap are not included. Kitchen utensils are included.
With that said, the decor is nice, the rooms are designed in an interesting way, and the space is comfortable. There is a blood red room with games, cards, a chase lounge, and interesting artwork for sale. Two bedrooms share the main bath, and the half bath is inside the 3rd bedroom. A common area bath does not exist. Each bed has a different comfort level: one is an older spring mattress, the next is foam, and the master was more hotel level. I preferred the foam bed in the leopard print carpet room. Allergy alert, the comforter is down in the master.
There are 12 places to eat in the kitchen and formal dining. I loved the elevator and stair option for those needing fitness and others needing knees.
The space is clean, near, and as photographed. It's downtown and eateries are as close as across the street. It appears they close rather early. You have to do some light chores before leaving. I didn't remember to take out the trash, but you need to put clothes in the washer, do the dishes, and take out the trash.
Noise? You will hear absolutely nothing from main street inside the house. I was worried about this with the loud trucks, motorcycles, and bar nearby. It was extremely quiet which is something I need.
The price is high compared to other comparable AirBnBs (for instance stayed at Disney world park in a 6 bedroom, 5 bathroom home with a heated pool, full breakfast, arcade room, Playstation 4s, and TVs in each room for only $98/ night. I'm sure they see more business though, so the overhead isn't as bad. Is it worth that price? Well considering the options when the only few hotels in town are booked, I say absolutely.
It's the best thing Woodward has to offer and you'll have a great time, so long as you're prepared. Grab some groceries, some drinks, and some good bath stuff and enjoy.
speaking of bath, one hint. if the tub is running cold for you and won't heat up, I learned that by running the shower on all the way hot a few minutes will fix that. My mom, poor thing, had a very chilly bath. I tinkered around and found the hack for myself.
Have fun! Thank you Jana et al for wonderful opportunity and stay."

Our family came for a visit with local family and this was a wonderful home away from home! We forgot a few things as can be expected, but I was so thankful for the resources and snacks that Douglas provided! It helped this busy and tired mom not have to make random store runs. We didn’t do much cooking at our stay, but they had a fully stocked spice cabinet and all the things you might ever need to prepare a feast of any sort! My children are older but they made accommodations for babies up to adults! Every part of their home was beautifully organized and there were wonderful binders with perfectly detailed instructions and information about the area. It is near a busy road but Douglas has made great efforts to minimize the traffic sounds to ensure you have a peaceful stay. We will definitely book again!"

This place slowed the world for me with the comfy couches an recliners an big screen tv's ,with any channel u could want. I'd come in from work an leave it at the gate, and its also roomy enough, that if i didn't Wanta see my roommate i didn't have to, i could play my guitar an not bother anyone else in the house:) ive only been playin for a couple years so not the best,hahaha.

I got to chat with him in person when I showed up and he showed me where to mostly put the ice melt in the drive way. His house is super clean and has everything you could possibly need in the kitchen! Also the 2 grills he has in the back are very nice and we wear them out every time we are there. 10/10 will stay here every time we come here for work!

I particularly liked that there is a tornado shelter in the property, we felt safe and comfortable.

Everything was super clean and cozy. We used this property for family to rest during sitting round the clock with a terminally ill family member. The layout of the home provided us ample space for some family to quietly rest while others could decompress and visit and grab food. We could easily come and go during shifts with our mother. When our mother passed away, our host had provided a bottle of chilled champagne and we gathered to share a beautiful and memorable moment to remember and toast the special life we had lost. We would highly recommend this listing and are grateful it was available to us."

He is a wealth of knowledge and I would venture to say that every person that stays there learns something new! Jamie is so welcoming and was always available to us if we needed anything, yet always respectful of our space and privacy. The view is breathtaking and he truly has a little slice of heaven he is so lucky to call home. The location is definitely remote, yet a short drive to the dunes and Waynoka where we wanted to visit the Rattle Snake Hunt event for the weekend. We had our dogs with us and it was the perfect space for us to set up to have them with us but also safe while we went into town. Thank you so much Jamie, for the hospitality and sharing your beautiful property with us. We will definitely be staying there again when visiting the area!"

Stayed with a pet",I cannot thank Jaime enough for the hospitality and kindness he showed my boyfriend and me. We decided last minute to get away and Jaime took us in with no problem and quickly got everything ready for us. We have never had a host respond or take care of us in a way he did. It was so peaceful and so amazing to be able to be in the country like that. And I absolutely loved the star gazing we did! It's a must for us to go back. We shall see you soon Jaime!

Stayed with a pet",This stay is one of our most unique and cool AirBnB stays. We caught some incredible weather with clear skies….you could see for miles with some of the cleanest air ever. Enjoyed several good discussions with Jamie about life and gardening. A really nice host. The guest house while adjacent to the old Wolf house was private and fully furnished to meet all our needs. Very comfortable. Spent twilight with my binoculars watching a family of deer play in a field down in the valley below. Saw the Milky Way in the middle of the night. Too cool! Jamie’s garden is impressive. Would definitely go out of my way to stay there again!

Stayed a few nights",Jamie’s place feels like home. Roma and I loved exploring the farm. The home had everything we needed plus so much more. The Wi-Fi worked great. Jamie is very friendly and helpful. He was always available if we ever needed anything. Gizmo is so sweet and friendly. Roma and I enjoyed our stay. Great value for money!

Stayed a few nights","My experience at Jamie’s place was spectacular. He is an incredibly gracious host, and went above and beyond to ensure my comfort was guaranteed. And the night sky out in the country…there is nothing so beautiful. Close enough to town to make getting food and supplies easy, but far enough away to know you are away from it all. I loved it!"
