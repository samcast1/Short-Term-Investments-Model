Stayed a few nights","This was my second time staying at Brandon's listing and it was so nice to experience the warmer weather this time! The other 2 guests were respectable and pleasant to chat with. I was able to take a walk around the block one early evening, and I felt extremely safe. The over all temp is chilly for me (70°F) as I am very cold natured, so bring extra long sleeves, hoodie, etc if you're cold natured. I enjoyed the porch one morning and afternoon, but the wasps did run me off after a while. Luckily, the other tenant killed 4 of them. The dishes are easy to find. This is still the BEST Airbnb that I have stayed at, and I would absolutely stay again. Highly recommend!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Brandon was a great host, very welcoming, and enjoyable to talk to. No issues with finding his home, or staying there. Very clean and beautiful home and other guests were pleasant also. VERY thankful for the extra blankets available, and plenty of room to move around in the bedroom. Spacious driveway and plenty of privacy inside. Brandon was alao so gracious to allow my son (Air Force) to spend a little time with me inside his home, and for that, I will be FOREVER thankful. Neighbors dog kept me awake (barking) for 4 hours on my last night there, but that was 1 out of 4 nights. HIGHLY recommend his place, and I would absolutely stay here again if he would let me. TOP NOTCH host and home. Truly a rare find!!!"

The rooms are spacious and comfy, everything is always clean, and Brandon & his fiancée are great company. They made my stay considerably better & I consider them good friends of mine now. If you’re looking for somewhere to stay in Minot, especially long term, look no further! 😊"

The location is definitely suburbia but everything you need is five minutes away. Downtown Minot, the old section, Is a real slice of small-town Americana and worth your time. Brandon recommended an excellent restaurant and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. If you’re heading to the national parks in North Dakota, the ride from Minot to the parks via route 23 is extraordinary as well."

Stayed a few nights","We cannot say enough great things about Robert's apartment. It is CLEAN, cozy, organized and close to everything we needed. Lots of wonderful restaurants in walkable distance. The apartment is very clean and has all the amenities and supplies. A very well stocked kitchen where we cooked a few meals. The use of space is incredible. Very private and quiet. The check in was easy and he was very friendly, helpful and informative and inviting. His wife's boutique downstairs was an unexpected plus. She and Robert are by far the nicest hosts we've ever had. We felt right at home. It was a wonderful week for my son's graduation from Minot State. We couldn't have asked for a better spot."

Stayed a few nights","I had a great stay at Oliver's Landing. Robert, the host, was very accommodating. He allowed me to check in early and check out late to meet the demands of my work schedule. He met me on-site to show me around and was very hospitable and warm. The apartment was cute, clean, and had everything I could possibly need while traveling. The kitchen was well-stocked. The location was great. There are cute shops and restaurants within walking distance. I enjoyed Prairie Sky Breads, a local bakery for breakfast. There is an excellent restaurant down the street called Off the Vine and the cutest local brewery called Atypical. Robert's apartment is an excellent place to stay if you're visiting Minot. This is the place I will stay whenever I visit Minot."

We didn’t need to use the space for much besides a place to sleep but the layout was awesome and accommodating for anyone looking for a short or long term rental alike. Robert met us upon check-in and gave us a tour of the apartment as well as the patio/common area that is open for guest use with a grill, pizza oven, and small bar set up. Robert and his wife were super helpful with things outside the needs of the room as well. They run the boutique located below the Airbnb so they are around if you need them. Can definitely say they are some of the most helpful and friendly hosts we’ve encountered. Our stay was amazing and we would absolutely recommend to anyone."

Super quiet and the bed gave us the best sleep we’ve had in months. The porch area would have been a fabulous place to entertain, but we didn’t know anyone local to treat them to. So we just had a romantic evening to ourselves. The access to “The Magic City” is right out the doorway, with plenty of places to eat, celebrate, buy books, and shop interesting places and antique shops. Robert is an over the top host, and was very attentive to our wants and needs."

Stayed a few nights","Robert's place is a fine example of what makes Air Bnb great. He has put so much thought and care and talent into creating a welcoming and comfortable space. He made a connection with us at check in and it helped us feel really at home in his space. The location is great, the bed comfortable and the space nicely decorated with exceptional use of light to create atmosphere. The highlight for us was the spacious and incredibly equipped deck. It is so unique and special. Our time on the deck allowed us to meet and visit with Robert's wife, a friendly and encouraging person. Lucky for us our home is only 95 miles from Minot meaning we can easily be repeat visitors and we certainly plan to be."

His wife’s boutique located in a connected hall was equally as well. The apartment itself was homey, and filled with memorable art and furniture. We were thankful for the walk-through with Robert and the tour around the property. 10/10, would refer a friend and stay again when in town. The white tablecloth is a sweet remembrance as well."

The apartment itself is stylish and modern, makes great use of the space, has a comfortable bed, and does not lack for amenities. The large patio in the back is simply charming with flowers and ferns. We had a great time visiting with the hosts over wine and cheese out there, and we had family over for dinner another night - it was the perfect space to sit back and enjoy a summer evening together. The hosts were incredibly gracious and hospitable and available to help with anything we needed. The location is also excellent, being right on Main Street which has restaurants, coffee, boutiques, galleries, a book store, a record store, and gift shops. It's so great to see a place like this in Minot! This would be a great place to stay anywhere, and to experience it in Minot was truly special. Highly, highly recommended."

Stayed about a week","Josh & Jenn provide a cozy place to stay in a safe area in Minot. The block is quiet, offers plenty of parking and the house itself stands out. I stayed for a week and did my own cooking but I noticed they do all have a myraid of restaurants to choose from, if you're looking to order or eat in public. My stay was during the winter, in a snow storm. Instead of having to worry about cleaing off my car after my visit, someone had already cleaned off the snow, which was very helpful.
Josh provided clear instructions for entry, laundry and things to do in the area. The place was clean and sufficient for my week stay. I was able to cook, clean, work and sleep without an issue. If I ever come back to Minot, if this place is available, I would more than likely book here again."

We came to Minot for our daughter's graduation from MSU and wanted a little more home-like environment than we'd get at a hotel. This fit the bill. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet (we slept with the windows open). Close to lots of restaurants, groceries, and activities. Communication was quick and clear. We felt safe and at home in the Yellow House Apartment!"

Stayed a few nights","Place was easy enough to find. Parking was reasonable. There was a lot right across the street to park in. In summer you could probably park on the street in front though. It’s a smaller place. The couch isn’t exactly comfortable, but it’s fine. Bed was pretty good. Overall the place was nice enough, just seemed a little overpriced for what you get. I would probably choose a hotel next time for the similar price. If it were cheaper than a hotel I would definitely recommend."

I stayed here while working in the area and it was a great place to stay with coworkers, it was cost effective and gave us the comfort of a home while away from home. The nearby brewery was noisy on Friday, as to be expected, that made it a little difficult to sleep while working the weekend, but very minor. We ended up needing to end our stay short due to our work assignment ending early. The hosts were great with handling the early cancellation and the refund policy is exactly as stated. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great place in the area."

So much better than a hotel would’ve been…at a hotel we would’ve needed 3 rooms and the cost for one room alone would’ve been around the same price as what we paid for all 9 to stay together! Apartment was clean and had everything we needed…other than a toaster which arrived at our door about 15 mins after we messaged Dylan about it!! When reading the guest book, one family mentioned 3 suggestions for Dylan, all of which seemed to have been rectified!…so very responsive! If you have kids, check out the Magic City Discovery Center! Overall, great experience! We would definitely stay again!

I used this location for my business trip, and I’ve never enjoyed a business trip so much!
The apartment was immaculate, supplied with every amenity you could ever need plus some extras. Very roomy, perfect for a family or a group.
YOU WILL NEVER REGRET BOOKING THIS APARTMENT, it is so much better than an everyday hotel in numerous ways. I highly recommend!
Dylan is a very gracious and responsive host, I look forward to going back. He really understands roots in the community, and you’ll understand when you arrive. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed staying here. Thank you so much."

The apartment is huge, and with everything we needed for our stay. There is a microbrewery next door and a food truck where folks were relaxing having conversations; however, we didn't hear any noise from it at all.
We really enjoyed the large open concept and nostalgic feel of the space. The A/C unit worked wonderfully. The bedrooms had plenty of room and the beds comfortable, however, some soft-mattress lovers may find them a bit firm.
Everything was very clean from the huge kitchen to the bathroom and laundry area. The living area has lots of seating and a huge TV; the Wi-Fi worked perfectly. Plus, it had a very interesting games room that is inside an old vault, with the original door still mounted. Also, there is a display of beautiful, locally crafted, jewellery available for purchase.
It was a relaxing and unique place, we'd definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","It was a very nice looking home, a little expensive for the area it’s in. However the comfort and layout of the place was excellent. I do wish we would have known it was attached to another apartment. We assumed it was a single private home not a townhouse. We could hear the neighbors some at night. Also the master bedroom tv would never work and they told us to read the manual to figure it out and we never could get it to work. The downstairs tv was in all Spanish so we had to figure that out as well. All in all it was a nice place just a few minor inconveniences."

Group trip","LOVED staying at this Airbnb!!!
Our family of 5 had plenty of space to spread out and relax. We were visiting our son and dtr in law who had their first baby in Minot and we wanted to spend time w/ them but come home to a separate place so they could adjust to new family life.
Matthew and Liliana’s home was the perfect place for us! With a warm greeting sign and hospitality basket, we felt welcomed. The house heater was on so it was nice and warm.
It had plenty of amenities that made it a comfortable home away from home— extra blankets, pillows, soaps, Kleenex, ice in the freezer, cabinets with pots and pans, dishes, etc.
We were grateful for the garage and garage door opener we were able to use during our time for easy coming and going. Shower water pressure and heater were excellent!! Comfy beds with blinds to block the sunlight allowed us to sleep in longer than planned.
Matthew and Liliana communicated regularly w/ us and answered all our questions promptly.
Highly recommend!!"

I was in town for a three-day family reunion and I am familiar with the local area. I was with my two boys and our sweet furry friend. Matthew and Liliana was very welcoming of our furry friend which was super helpful to avoid having to spend three nights in a cramped hotel room.
The house is gorgeous and has everything you need. It is literally your home away from home. I absolutely loved the personalized welcome sign when I first walked into the house.
The location is absolutely perfect! Restaurants and grocery stores are within a 10 minute drive. Minot Air Force Base is roughly eight miles north. It’s also close to most of the local hotels which was great for me since most of my out of town family were staying in them.
Overall, this place is a gem! You can’t beat the price and the location! I absolutely look forward to my next visit!"

Beds were so comfy and we all slept so good, with the most comfortable blankets and pillows too! We loved the overall set-up of his home with the split level areas, very convenient and peaceful. The beautifully folded swan towels were such a neat touch! Also, the garage is such a neat feature that it's a fully finished warm lounge area, we couldn't believe that it was the garage! We can tell Brad has put enormous effort into every detail of this home and sincerely appreciate his dedication to excellence. Highly recommended, 10/10☆"

Nice laundry room with soap and everything. Even the bedding was nice. It felt like home and was just what we needed during a stressful time. Also my dad was released from the hospital a few days early and so we didn’t need to stay at the house as long as thought and Jozey let us check out early and refunded some of our money. It was very much appreciated."

She created me, showed me around, provided a couple fresh towel (having two is my essential routine), and her puppies were so cute and friendly! The room itself was gorgeous and perfect after a long day of driving. I will definitely be coming back the next time I am in the area!"

Check in and out was extremely easy and Robert even met us there to give us the basics and show us how to use the gates and where to park in the back. We even received a key to access the front door on Main Street to be right out on the sidewalk where we could walk anywhere downtown. I highly recommend!"

Robert met us at check in, and despite the last minute booking and the earlier than expected arrival he had snacks waiting for us and ran back to meet us early. The bedding (even for the couch), bed and pillows were all very high quality. The decor was bright and made us want to stay in the apartment. Bathroom had lots of drawers/storage and we had lots of space in general. Even a washer/dryer! Kitchen had every utensil and piece of equipment/glassware you could ever need. The deck with patio heaters and flowers was the perfect place for evenings and morning coffee. This was so much better than a Minot ”blah” hotel room... Centrally located too! Thank you for being an amazing host!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Robert’s Air B&B with my boyfriend for 2 nights, and while we had high expectations for it just by its advertisements, actually staying there and experiencing it far surpassed our expectations. When we walked in, the room smelled amazing right off the bat and gave it a unique feel.
The kitchen was clean, and well-equipped with cups, glasses, dishes, and cutlery. Complimentary tea, coffee, K-cups and even a few snacks were stocked in the cupboards as well.
The bed was super comfortable and had the biggest, coziest comforter ever! In the living room, the TV was really great. We hooked up the HDMI cable from the DVD player to my laptop and watched Netflix using the WiFi.
In the bathroom, there were a lot of different choices for shampoos and soaps for both men and women. There were towels to spare, and even if you did somehow run out of towels there’s a washer/dryer available to use in the room, with laundry soap and dryer sheets provided.
All in all, the stay at the B&B was 10/10. It was quiet, private, and extremely cozy."

Stayed one night","Darin’s place was in a nice, newer neighborhood. It is about 10 minutes from downtown, but that didn’t bother us. It was clean, quiet, and spacious. Our main complaint was that for the money we paid, it was lacking amenities. We realized at 1 am that there was no toilet paper in the house. There was a washer and dryer but no detergent, and no body wash or conditioner in one of the bathrooms. However, when I texted the host about the missing TP at 7:00 am the next morning, there was some at my door within 30 minutes, which was appreciated. A few more amenities and maybe some basic condiments/food in the house would go a long way. That’s something I expect with a $250/night airbnb. With all that said, I would stay there again!"

Stayed one night","Darin and Carmen’s place was a perfect stop on our way to and from Regina. In my first review, I mentioned two features that we liked best: the comfortable beds and sound bar. I forgot to mention … the townhouse has excellent air quality! We brought our Aranet carbon dioxide detector, and the readings were close to outdoor air quality! For the nerds out there / health conscious, this townhome has excellent air exchanges!"

Two bonuses: the beds were actually comfortable (so many AirBnbs go with cheap beds!) … and there was a sound bar to make for a better movie experience! Thank you both for being such gracious hosts!

I did enjoy the sounds of the Gibbon in the zoo! Great zoo by the way! We went twice!
the shower/tub needs Grab bars and non slip strips.
A hand rail down to the laundry would help. Also the board under the washer is a trip hazard. I tripped twice. The floors themselves were a bit of a trip hazard. I've never seen such a wavy floor. I'm amazed the flooring was installed so well!
It is Minot, so it was a good place for our whole family to gather and the price was right."

Stayed with kids","Lisa was a great host. We stayed here for one of the coldest weeks of the year. It's hard to keep old houses like this one warm but Lisa made sure we had plenty of blankets and even brought us another space heater which really made a difference in the upstairs rooms. The house was clean and had all the amenities we needed for a family gathering. We used this location for a family Christmas where we could all stay and it worked wonderfully. We were able to cook a ham in the oven, have coffee with our pancakes, bacon, and eggs in the morning and best of all, just be together.
As for sleeping arrangements, it was so nice to have rooms available for everyone. The hosts even provided us with a pack'n'play for the < 2yo to sleep in and a high-chair which made meal times much simpler.
Only real issue we had (aside from cold North Dakota weather ❄️) was the beds. They were all memory foam mattresses which most of us were not used to and not overly fond of."

Lisa was very responsive and even offered to provide some dishes for leftovers (not necessary) and the place was decorated beautifully and everyone had a bed enjoyed looking at the lights across the street at the zoo. Linens, utensils, and even a fan in our bedroom! YES! :-)
Entry to the house was easy peasy and the location was easy to locate. The House Rules book was very helpful and the we took advantage of all of the local recommendations especially the coffee places.
The street in front is very busy but there wasn't any noise that distracted us, and the parking in the snow on the street was a little challenging, but it's not a deal breaker and we can't wait to come back to this spot!
We can't wait to come back in the fall and stay here when we watch our boys play some football!
YNOT MINOT!

The house was only about 10 minutes from the airport, within walking distance to the zoo/park, and perfectly located close to basically everything. Our family of 6 was flying in for the week for a family reunion (40 years in the making), and this home was absolutely perfect for us!!! There were rooms designed for all of our kids (range 4-23 yo), one room even had an awesome little hidden nook/play area (where our 4yo would disappear for hours). The kitchen was perfect (I love to cook at home), with more than enough supplies to whip up an amazing dinner for us and our extended family. The bedding.... oh my freshness!!! I have never in all my life stayed in a rental where I found myself rubbing my face in the blankets and sheets simply because they smelled SO GOOD!!! To say it was just Clean would seriously be an understatement! I cannot say enough good things about this little gem in the heart of Minot. God willing, we will return soon, and hopefully we can snag this place up again. Thank you SO much for letting us stay, and for being such amazing hosts. God Bless You!!!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great time with this cute Airbnb in Minot. Central to everything, the Zoo and Roosevelt Park are literally across the street. There is baseball park (with minor league baseball) right behind the house with a lot of Summertime fun in you want to catch a game. The hosts were terrific, checking in on us and making sure we were comfortable. They also let us know of events that were happening while we were in town, so we didn’t miss anything. The beds were comfortable, and the living space gave us a lot of room to stretch out. We didn’t use the upstairs, but you could comfortably fit a large family or two smaller ones in this house. The laundry was also a huge bonus. Having two bathrooms with 3 boys was amazing and also meant we didn’t fight over showers. The kitchen had everything we needed to make sure everyone was fed. The value, location and the hosts of the house made this a 5-star location for us! We will definitely book this Airbnb the next time we find ourselves in Minot."

They had everything we’d discussed beforehand in place and ready for use when we arrived. Check-in was quick and the door lock was super simple…just make sure you get the green check mark on the lower left when you lock up to go anywhere. The checkout process was not complicated and the few items asked of us were things that a thoughtful guest should do without being asked anyway. Thank you so much for providing a home that was a pleasant retreat from an otherwise busy, chaotic “vacation”."

We could not be more pleased with the house, the location, the amenities and the cleanliness.

If we ever come back to Minot again, we will still choose Kelsey’s Airbnb."

Huge tvs in both the living area and master bedroom which also had a king size bed which we loved. Washer and dryer in the basement was great to have also. Dog friendly and the neighborhood was quiet and had great sidewalks with grass for the pups. Front yard is fenced in if you want to use for a quick bathroom break for them. There’s a jacuzzi in the back which we didn’t use only thing I would say is if the back was fenced in it would feel private and we probably would have gone in. The house is close to the downtown area with great food and drinks. Definitely book if you find yourself traveling through Minot. Thanks for everything"

Stayed with a pet","Nice little old home & obviously they are in the process of working on it but some of the work shows lack of knowledge/skill. We thought the renovation were done but they are not. (Nails protruding, painting not done, crooked shelves, cabinets not attached to walls completely, drawer won’t stay closed, missing drapes causing lack of privacy-even in the bathroom, water damage in basement-flooring not attached, no transitions in place, no spare blankets).
We were glad we did not end up adding additional occupants because it would have been too tight. Very disappointed with back yard: not mowed recently, not fenced closed, skipped hot tub because it isn’t a secured space (transients could be using it & you would never know), furniture shown in pictures were missing, not sure where regular trash was supposed to go & what we were supposed to do to check out.
Washer & dryer were great!
Thank you & good luck on your project improving this home. Just wanted the pics & $ to reflect honestly!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great time. The house was clean and very easy to find. Check-in and out were both very easy. We accidentally locked ourselves out of the house once during our stay, and we greatly appreciated the immediate response to come unlock it for us! Our only comment would be that the two upstairs “bedrooms” are not self contained - one doesn’t have a door and the other is an open area. We were traveling to visit family, so we were able to rearrange some plans and make it work for what we needed (one member of our party ended up staying elsewhere). But if you were planning for a group who needs four distinct bedrooms, this could potentially be an issue. Overall, the house was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our time and would definitely stay here again in the future!"

Stayed one night","This house is very clean, good location and a front fenced in yard for the dogs. We only stayed for a night on our way through town but the massive bed in the master was much appreciated and very comfortable."

Stayed with a pet","My dog and I were on a road trip from Minneapolis to Saskatoon. We stopped at Antonio's for a quick stop to shower, eat and get a good night sleep. Great communication and very easy to find and access the home. The hot tub was hot upon arrival which I enjoyed before a nice hot shower. The kitchen was fully stocked and spacious. I loved the bed in the bedroom downstairs. It was a great location to get on and off the main road. This was just what we needed."
