Stayed a few nights","This home felt just like my parents home ""right down to the towels"" as my husband noted. 😆 The home inside could have used more lighting as the carpet and decor are dark. I also would have liked knowing there would be up to 8 other guests all sharing 2 bathrooms (but it all worked out!) The bed was comfy and the room adequate. 😌 The fridge and microwave in the laundry room were a plus! Thank you for an affordable, comfortable stay."

Stayed a few nights","Rachelle place was great as my base during my visit to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, and local Flagstaff nature! Her place had lots of very useful amenities (from laundry to kitchen equipment) that i felt comfortable using. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and peaceful. There is some public transportation available (a somewhat direct bus from downtown to Rachelle, albeit ending with a 5 min uphill walk). Other guests were staying in rooms close to mine, bathroom was next door, and I frequently interacted with members of the family that live at the house. It felt very homey and I was able to ask questions and get help quickly whenever i needed to. Would definitely recommend Rachelle's place to anyone needing a stopover or a base for exploring the surrounding nature :)"

Just one little thing, it was a little chilly at night (dropped to 35 degrees Fahrenheit outside).
We also recommend Lava River Cave, 25 minutes from Fresno. And of course Sedona."

Essential toiletries were available should we have forgotten something. Felt right at home. Very thoughtful towards what would make a great stay, with provision of little night lights in key places etc. Rachelle was quick to respond too when we had a request. It’s a beautiful location, highly recommended."

Rachelle and her parents present in the house were welcoming and friendly, I recommend it!
Small downside: the bathroom that could be cleaner especially when several guests share it
Good to know: when the upstairs bathroom is occupied (which was often the case for us) do not hesitate to use the one on the floor"

Very polite and nice as I entered, just a little awkward, I would’ve liked just following their directions in the description and getting to sleep and getting on my way. I arrived at 10:45pm and left at 5am the next morning, VERY quick stay. Value is there if you’re in and out, I just wasn’t looking to chat or have dialogue with anyone, probably more my own fault.

There is a suggestion of a tea party for 6 and the table is set for eight with eight chairs and service for eight. There isn't a place to store the china while you eat.

What an incredible surprise - an escape we didn’t even realize we truly needed until entering the enchanting Mad Hatter - Alice in Wonderland home. The description of the place was spot on - it’s not your “typical” accommodation- you’re truly transported into an adventure - so many fun details around every corner… where adults (and kids) embark on a real-life fairytale… leaving the stressors of the day to day behind.
We enjoyed every minute (hot tub, games/swings outside, dress-up hats, record player, hammock, treats, hiking across the street, and creative decorations/messages that made the stay extra special.
Everything you need is at your fingertips - and the communication and attention to detail were incredible.
We highly recommend this magical place … hopefully you find it as amazing as we did. :)"

Stayed one night","To start off this was the most magical and memorable overnight stay I've had at any place. It was romantic and such a delight. The photos simply do not capture the magic of this House nor does it capture the beautiful view of the stars from the backyard. Everything was neat, organized, clean, and had some personal care items as well which was a very nice touch. Jen was always in easy to reach communication and made check in and out instructions very simple and clear. I was so happy that I was able to come across this very special and unique find. If I come back to this area, I will certainly make sure that I book the Hatter house again! Thank you so much Hatter House for all of the wonderful memories ❤️"

Stayed a few nights",One of the most unique AirBnBs that we’ve ever stayed in. Loved this home so much and wish we could have stayed longer. So many Alice in Wonderland details made this place so special. You can tell there was so much thought and time put into this home. The hot tub was also lovely to relax in after a long day. Has everything you need for the most comfortable stay and the ambiance makes you feel like a kid again.

The kitchen had everything you would need to cook meals and the pancakes were thoughtful touch left by the host. The bathrooms were well-stocked with toiletries. The washer and dryer worked well and was very handy. Jen even supplies soap powder! Upstairs was quirky and fun. My son loved the hammock. The beds were very comfortable. There were even dog beds and bowls! Such a thoughtful host. I loved spending time looking around. We stayed here to visit the South Rim Grand Canyon and the drive was lovely. Such an unforgettable stay. Thanks, Jen!"

Stayed with a pet","We recently stayed 3 nights here. The house is definitely unique & the inside is as described. The location was great as it was within 10-15 minutes to Downtown Flag, right across the street from hiking & just a few minutes from two dog parks for our pup. It was easy to locate with directions provided & using navigation. The house is on the older side but they have done a great job keeping things fresh & clean. The main issue we had was the yard area. It was very overgrown & neglected with weeds. For instance, the listing points out the firepit, but as it is now it would not be safe to start a fire due to the weeds. There were also gaps in the fence where a smaller dog could get out. We ended up blocking those off with things from the yard. In the current state, we didn't feel comfortable allowing our pup to be outside unattended. The outside area needs immediate attention. We realize Airbnb rankings are strict, but after talking through it we could not give it 5 stars based on this."

The location is great. We walked across the street to hike Mt Elden. The Matador coffee house is a 2 min drive as well. Not too far from Buffalo Park and it was about a 30-40 min drive to the lava cave. After the adventures, coming back to the well taken care of hot tub was great. There was plenty of room for my dog to roam. We'd definitely book this place again."

Every time I looked around I saw something new that I hadn't noticed before. Everything had been very well cleaned before our arrival and the beds and linens were super comfy. Some of my favorite parts (I'll try to limit it to 3) were the teacups hanging on the front porch, the awesome swing by the fire pit, and the cieling lights actually working in the master bedroom. I really hope to be able to visit again!!"

Which was great but maybe took a little of the magic out of searching the property. I could totally picture a family looking around the house and property for the first 1 hr of check in! The added amenities exceeded my expectations, after two long days of snowboarding coming home to a nice warm house and hot tub was awesome. Master bed was super comfortable and soft. We were craving popcorn one night to watch a movie and there just happen to be a bag provided with all the coffee’s, creamers, tea’s, pancake mix, etc. We didn’t bring any shampoo/conditioner and the house had some good quality shampoo/conditioner. The host was super responsive, she seemed to message back immediately. You can tell a lot of thought went into this property and they really wanted to please their guests. Thank you again and would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Mainly booked this to have a hot tub. 1st night the hot tub ended up irritating our skin (itchy & red bumps) & completely bleaching my bathing suit. When I brought it up to the host, she didn’t show any concern & said someone will clean it the next day. We didn’t hear anything until I messaged again at 5pm the next day about it. Then she sent someone. Turns out the previous guest before us dumped a WHOLE bottle of chlorine into it. He said he’s never seen that much in a hot tub & had to drain it multiple times. Seems irresponsible to leave it up to a guest to put chlorine in the hot tub without checking it for the next guest.
On another note, the house was okay but could use some updating. The showers were old & the floors were really creaky. Also the home is right off a busy street. Some of the windows didn’t have any curtains to make it private at night so it did make us a lil nervous at times when it was dark. I feel like the pictures don’t capture the home well."

Stayed with a pet","5 star review for the overall theme. We loved all the decor and little touches to follow with the Mad Hatter Theme! There was great communication with the host and check in and out was very easy. The location, while on a busy highway was fine for us. There was a lot of ambulance and helicopter sounds at night, I imagine it must be close to a hospital?
We didn't didn't find the dog friendly accommodations until the last night we left as we didn't open and search the closets until we were looking for an extra bath towel. But that's probably our fault for not being nosey LOL. An outside trash receptacle for doggie waste bags would have been convenient too, if there was one we didn't see it.
Again we really loved all the decor and the whole experience. There were some burnt out lightbulbs and the outside tables and hot tub cover were very dusty/dirty. We had to wipe them off to be able to use the outside table. We didn't use the hot tub while there due to the strong chemical smell when we lifted the cover. I know to expect that but it was a lot stronger than i'm normally used to and we opted not to use it. And just little things like burnt out lightbulbs, stickey counters and only 2 tissues in the tissue box. We did look through the kitchen cabinets for additional kleenex but didn't see any. Again nothing huge just small minor things.
We were going to have a ""tea"" party but the only tea flavor that we really liked (Cherry Blossom) only had 2 bags and my mom hogged them for herself. We did really like the brand and flavor though and ordered some off Amazon to enjoy at home! It was also advertised in the listing that cookies were provided for the tea party experience but there were none that we could find. There was an empty bowl on the county when we arrived, which based on other pictures we've seen is where the cookies would have been.
Overall a really nice experience and it was a great place to stop in our travels for a couple days to get some personal work done for my remote job and to get a break from the car.
Thanks for such a unique experience!"

Stayed a few nights","What a magical fun place and great experience all around! We enjoyed our visit so much, such fun, creativity, and attention to detail. Instead of a run-of-the-mill place to stay, The Mad Hatter and Alice in Wonderland theme throughout adds a special touch. Jen has thought of everything in putting her place together and is ready to help with information or whatever comes up. We enjoyed it all -- dinner at the elaborate tea party table, a hot soak in the spa, a round of croquet by the ""flower bed"", a swing on the swing, playing the piano, a game of chess using massive chess pieces, even a romp in the master bedroom under the decorated ceiling and ornate mirrors. The location was perfect for our visit to Flagstaff. Looking forward to another stay. Highly recommend!"

Jen did a great job creating an awesome experience that you don't usually find in typical air bnbs. From the decor, the landscaping, great hot tub, croquet, and much more. My husband and I enjoyed it all. We even watched Alice & Wonderland on our iPad in the hot tub. since my husband had never seen it. Great 5 STAR property for guests of all ages!"

Stayed with kids","We love this home. I booked this room last minute for my sweet daughter's 13th. I wanted her first ""teen"" birthday to be special. She was amazed and loved every single special touch. We enjoyed the jacuzzi with our sparkling soda n/a ""mimosas"". We even had our own Mad Hatter's tea party and played a little Wonderland Croquet!
There were many restaurants and great shopping very close by. I liked it because I didn't have to drive far in the ""Dark Skies"" of Flagstaff to get what we needed. We we very close to Lowell Observatory, which is where we spent my daughter's birthday evening. This home is so well laid out and so adorable. Wonderful. We loved every minute."

At first we were a little weary of the location being on a highway when we were looking for solitude, but once we entered the house, we felt like we were taken to a totally different place and we were completely unaffected by outside forces. Our dog also loved the yard and the awesome pet beds provided. We will be back and would recommend to anyone🥳"

Stayed with a pet","Such a great weekend in Flagstaff! This house is exactly as pictured and made for an excellent and much needed escape from reality. The swings in the backyard along with the hot tub for two were two of our favorite things to enjoy. There is also a fire pit and croquet. Jen, the host, was easy to communicate with and left cookies and water for us to enjoy during our stay as well as a full selection of teas and coffee. The location is close to pup-friendly breweries and restaurants and Jen has a closet with dog beds and dishes to help your pups feel at home. By far the best AirBnB I have stayed at!! Thanks Jen!"

They responded quickly to any questions which was appreciated. I would definitely consider choosing this place for a future visit to Flagstaff.

Stayed with a pet","Aside from the unique decor, this house has nothing else to offer. Our family had an awful time and cut our reservation short and left early, because it was an awful stay.
Backyard is full of weeds. I understand monsoon and rain season in Flagstaff. More of a reason to have landscaping more often to prepare for this. Broken mirrors outside making it dangerous for our dog and children.
The two rooms upstairs are a joke. The room with the hammock is so small that you literally can't even move. The other bedroom just fits a queen size bed.
Lots of loud road noise because the house is literally on the highway. The air conditioners are extremely loud and do not reach the master downstairs.
The couch by the front door was in awful condition full of stains, hair and other nasty particles. The landlord said that she was replacing the couch one hour prior to our arrival, which made it inconvenient for her because we arrived a bit early. It will take much longer than an hour to get the large couch out of the house and the new couch inside for our arrival.
When I reached out to the host to help with our concerns, she was very rude and dismissive. She stated that she can't control my expectations. Our family was just looking for a safe and fun house and this place was definitely not the one."

You are not likely to encounter neighbors but can walk to Starbucks, or a little further in opposite direction to a much better local coffee roaster called Matador. it's a pretty-ish walk of about a mile each way. But you're better off picking it up in the car and then heading to a hike in Walnut Canyon."

The location was great; right next to Safeway for essentials, and a short drive to downtown Flagstaff for food and shopping. The trails nearby were closed due to fire restrictions, but we still found plenty to do...including the Flagstaff Mall just down the road. Travelers with dogs will appreciate the fenced yard. The kids say: ""Another great thing are the pianos. They are really fun. I loved having a tea party☕🫖"""

Jen is a great host and has created he most fun rabbit hole ;) It did get a bit hot in the master bedroom at night but Jen had a fan and opening the windows helped. There were A/C units in most every room so we were all good. The house was also right off the highway so traffic sounds are a thing when outside but didn’t bother us at all. If you are going through Flagstaff and looking for a fun time whether with friends or family this is a one-of-a-kind fun experience and not to be missed!

Some things on the amenity list were not found in the house. There was a wasp problem in the back yard and a lot of cobwebs/spiderwebs. Im not sure if anyone tends to the back yard except for the jacuzzi. I mentioned everything to the host and she was very nice about it and going to take care of them but my thought is everything should be taken care of before her next guest comes to stay.

Stayed with kids","The new standard against which all AirBnB's will be judged! This place is overflowing with creative touches and fun amenities: old-timey record player that my husband enjoyed, harpsichord on which my son happily played ""ominous music,"" popcorn, pancake mix, a wall you can write and draw on, a hammock my son loved sleeping in, hot tub, croquet, and so much more to discover. We did not find anything we could possibly have asked Jen for or about, but I'm confident if we needed her, she would've been quick to respond and help out. It's near the Safeway for groceries (my husband walked there) and there's a nice little pueblo ruin (Elden Pueblo) up the street. Follow Jen's directions to find it; Google will steer you wrong. Minor caveats that might apply to specific people: It's right off the highway, so if you are very sensitive to that kind of noise you might be unhappy. There's a lot of china around, so if you have roughhousing kids that could be a challenge. The stairs to the attic bedrooms are weird and steep, so people with limited mobility or clumsy toddlers might struggle--but the master bedroom is downstairs."

The scenery is exquisite, and the peacefulness that came over us while we were there was undeniably needed at the time. Be sure to pick up food and extra drinking water, the closest grocery store is about 25 minutes out. The hosts are very accommodating, answered all questions or any texts within minutes, and went above and beyond to share all the deets about the amazing things to explore nearby. Definitely recommend to all people looking for an escape into the minimalist state of mind. It's the perfect spot to reconnect with what truly matters."

The bed/bath linens were high-end and beds were comfortable. There were high-end, non-toxic amenities throughout (bath/body, kitchen, laundry, etc) provided. There is so much to do and see in the area! There is a highway and busy train tracks that can be seen and heard from the house, although they did not bother us and the host provided sound machines in both of the bedrooms. Even though the house sits on a working ranch property, we felt we had plenty of privacy during our stay."

Beds, bathrooms, kitchen, living room, etc. were all perfect! Being an active ranch it was also fun to see the animals in the morning, and in particular meeting one of their very sweet and affectionate cats. If you're looking for a home base for the area, but with more privacy and quite we would definitely recommend staying at the Ranch House!"

It snowed while we were there and they shoveled the sidewalk in the mornings before we got up! Yes, I’m serious! I could not say enough about this stay in this review. I have stayed in many many places while traveling and this is absolutely the best. I would refer anyone to this property. Both king beds in each room, absolutely amazing to sleep on. Nice soaking tub in the master bathroom which was amazing! Everything is squeaky clean. It’s just one of those places you feel at home the moment you walk in. Even if this place is a little farther away from where you would actually like to stay, I would stay here. Five stars! ￼"

Sedona, the Grand Canyon and walnut canyon which was literally 5 mins from her place. Great restaurants in town. We had a day where we all just stayed in and watch a series on the TV snuggled up on her super comfy couch with the fireplace on. I loved it there so much. We weren’t bothered by it, but it is very close to the highway so you hear the train and cars go by if you’re outside and a little hum of it inside but it’s really not even an issue. Seriously her place is a gem and I would stay here again and again"

And I loved the digital guidebook! It was so helpful. The home had everything you could need, especially if you’re traveling with a little one. The high chair and pack and play were nice to have, but the children friendly dishware, toys and books were the best part! The home was near the highway and railroad tracks but noise was minimal, we barely noticed. Our favorite part was how peaceful it felt since it was away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but still close if we wanted to get out. Also, being able to see the cows from the kitchen window every day was a delight.
I cannot say enough good things about Jenna and her home. We will definitely be booking again the next time we are visiting Flagstaff. Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time! Went to Flagstaff for grandson's graduation from NAU. Spent three nights of some of the best sleep in a long time in very comfy beds. The outside is very plain, but once inside, everything is updated and works great. The smart TV with all the Netflix and Amazon Prime videos was enjoyed at night. Jenna had some recommended eateries, so we tried out the eatery at 3 Beaver St and had the best breakfast, then headed across the street to the bagel shop for the next morning's breakfast. Everything is within 15 minutes and easy to get to. We were in Flag about three years ago and discovered a wood carver who makes bears of every size and eagles, etc. He was only 15 minutes away, so we went over and bought another wood-carved bear and an eagle. I love trains! And about a quarter mile away are the train tracks, not so loud as to be bothersome, but a wonderful backdrop. This place is just off the freeway. VERY CLEAN!"

We pulled in one night to huge deer! Close to highway which made traveling to Horseshoe Bend and Meteor Crater. Highly recommend staying here!

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed staying at this house in Flagstaff! We were there for the North Pole Experience with Santa, which was just 10 minutes away. The house was spotless & I think new construction. Modern furniture, kitchen & bathrooms (with a beautiful soaking tub).
The house is on a ranch. We saw some cute cows near a barn. It was a very beautiful setting & allowed my child to run around outside, instead of being cooped up in a hotel. There is a highway at the edge of the ranch. The minimal traffic noise didn’t bother us and we slept well. They had sound machines in the bedrooms for white noise, but we didn’t need them.
It rained in the mornings while we were there, but we happily hung out on the comfy couch, read & played board games. It was a quick drive to Whole Foods, Local Juicery & Pita Jungle (which has yummy gluten-free pitas and pizza). We did a scenic 1 hour drive to Sedona for a daytrip & hike up to Cathedral Rock. We loved our stay at this house!"

About traffic, local stores, restaurants, things to do even about the ranch animals. House was super clean and very specious. I have to mention about the supplies. Bathroom, kitchen, laundry room was full of supplies. There was nothing missing that I can ask for. Neighbors were so friendly. They let us pat their animals and take pictures. Very comfortable 4 nights. Highly recommend this place. If I come this side again, of course I would try to get this place. I thank Jenna a lot for all the help and communication."

Stayed a few nights","This was THE BEST AirBnB we have ever stayed at. The house had any and all amenities anybody could ever want. From the sound machines in the bedroom to the fully stocked kitchen and laundry room, there was nothing we wanted for. The house was spotless, and smelled clean. I even looked for dust and couldn’t find any. The bedroom closets also had everything we needed including different sized hangers and a hamper.
The property itself was something out of a movie. Within 50 steps we were face to face with 80 of the cutest cows we’ve ever seen. The owners were more than helpful guiding us to the Arizona Trail, where we saw the cows grazing and a mountain view. The cats followed us everywhere we went and became a source of love&entertainment.
We can’t say enough about how absolutely incredible this home/property is. We will 100% be back and will recommend this place to everybody we know."

It is the most beautiful, clean, organized, peaceful place to rest & re-charge! We were blown away by the cozy, peaceful environment & the natural soaps, lotions, etc that were provided by the host. Jenna is very communicative & kind. The digital guidebook was 1000 times better than any binder. Check in & check out were a breeze. We honestly wish we could live here full time.

The bed was so comfortable, I don’t think I’ve ever had such a great night’s sleep on a vacation ever, the bed was so comfortable?! In addition to the comfortable, spacious interior, the ranch property the home sits on is sprawling and offers privacy— and yet is an easy, 15 minute drive to downtown Flagstaff. (Check out Pizzicleta for their delish handmade pizzas!). The sunset views are incredible, and the sweet barn kitten on property was so friendly and sweet! Jenna was so easy to communicate wit! It was the perfect getaway from the Phoenix heat, we would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed one night","This is a brand new remodel with all modern amenities. It is on a working ranch, so that is pretty fun. There was a round-up while we were there, so we got to visit with the owner's family. They were non-instrusive but welcomed this interaction that occurred at our instigation. I have been an interior designer for over 20 years, and this little home as ALL the designer touches. This was perhaps the cleanest Airbnb I have ever rented with lots of thoughtful perks such as local whole bean coffee with grinder, tea and hot pot for water, and any bathroom supply you might possibly forget to pack. I would definitely choose this location again! The only small negative is that it is located close to the freeway and train tracks. However, once inside the house, there was not any noise problem. Chaparral pines seclude the home and provide great privacy. The host was very responsive when we reached out."

The is in a private area and very close to the snowbowl. It's very relaxing and has some pretty neat features. Highly recommend, especially during the busy season.
Cons: The cabin was very dusty and sorry to say, but the floors were dirty too. This place needs a good cleaning. We had a 10 month old with us, and it's important to be clean.
2nd - The power went out 4 times in the middle of the night over a two day stay. Chris helped provide direction on how to start the generate. Overall: 4/5 Stars"

The lodge itself is so thoughtfully decorated and comfortable that you feel like you are staying at a friend's well-appointed home; I especially loved the cozy little reading nooks that were perfect for relaxing with a good book. The kitchen had lots of supplies, and in addition to the well-appointed interior, there are great places to hang out outside on the front patio and an outdoor fire pit. The location is great, too; nice hiking nearby, and less than an hour from the south rim of the Grand Canyon, Wupatki and Sunset Crater N.M.s, and lots of good restaurants in Flagstaff only 15 minutes away.

Stayed with kids","The cabin and location were awesome. The only things that made it a bad experience were that there was no microwave and no wifi, and the dvd player didnt work or wasnt connected to the tv properly. I also would have appreciated if they came out to try and fix the wifi instead of just messaging us to restart it or saying they would call about it the next day. I was there with my family on a working trip and was unable to do any work and I didnt have any cell service either with at&t. We also didnt know until check in that we had to remove all the bedding and towels and put them in the laundry or do the dishes etc. Just please be more transparent and honest and have a little more quick customer service going forward. I will however not be staying there again."

He keeps the road clear when snowing. One downside is that our internet connection and therefore TV was poor though out most of our stay (too slow to stream anything on TV or any other device). We made Chris aware that this was advertised as an amenity, and he said that the dish was covered in snow and apologized.
Would recommend the place for families with kids as well as adults only groups. We had so much fun!"

Stayed a few nights","Chris's cabin is wonderful - we really can't recommend it enough. It's even more charming than the photos suggest, and our family declared it one of the best places we've stayed!
After a couple of nights in hotels on our trip around National Parks, this cabin felt like an oasis - and with a huge washer and dryer and plenty of hot water (despite being an off grid cabin), it really allowed us the chance to clean up and recharge. Even though it's a 2 bedroom there was plenty of room to spread out. And although we were there during snow so didn't get a chance to use the outside spaces - I can only imagine how nice it would be to sit on the covered front porch in slightly warmer weather and take in the amazing view.
Chris was so welcoming and helpful and genuinely a super host.
(One thing to mention - the upstairs 2nd bedroom is accessed by a spiral staircase which is totally stable and secure, but just something to be aware of if your group has really little ones or anyone who is a little unsteady on their feet.)
This really is a perfect cabin - highly, highly recommend!!"

The lodge was amazing, every corner had a unique piece of furniture or decor to look at, and the kitchen had all the essentials for cooking (utensils, pots, dishes, spices), so we just had to buy food and drinks. Chris and his son were very accommodating and even gave recommendations of where to go sledding and where to eat. It was snowing when we went so the kids had plenty of space on the property to play in the snow, it was awesome!"

Stayed about a week","This is a great stay for anyone looking to be out in the woods for a few days. The cabin itself has all the amenities one might need. The photos are spot on and do a much better job than me of describing the cabin. It is close to Grand Canyon, numerous trails and places to explore in the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, and it is a short trip back to Flagstaff for supplies or just to visit Flag.
While there is wi-fi, it is way off the grid so don't come expecting highspeed broadband. Email and web surfing is fine. Streaming is spotty. But you didn't come out here to stay inside and watch Netflix did you?"

The property borders the national forest so you are surrounded by ponderosa pine and aspens. It is a perfect place to get away from city life and be immersed in nature. We can’t wait to go back!

Group trip","Absolutely loved it here. Do not pass this experience up. So afforadable and so far the most charming and best vacation my family has had. The view alone is worth the price and stay, but then you have this amazing cabin to curl up in and relax with your family or even just yourself. Everything about this stay is extremely friendly and professional. All the way down to the bedding, which we are absolutely in love with. Host was extremely nice and accommodating and gives you a brief history of the place which just makes you fall even more in love. We will definitely be coming back."

Both of them were so fitting for our Grand Canyon trip. There was plenty of room for our party of 7. Everything from the beds to the location were wonderful. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

It is a short drive to flagstaff, next to pleanty of hiking, and only an hour drive to the grand canyon.

Stayed a few nights","Amazing place! This property is very cool. The main house has plenty of room for several guests. The downstairs bed is very large and comfortable. The bathroom has double sinks and a really neat stone shower/bath. Super comfy bedding and towels. The kitchen had everything we needed and the grill was great. We loved the extra large table outside for dining al fresco. The couches in the living room were nice. The décor is amazing. A couple of our kids used the pull out couch to sleep on. The upstairs bed is good size and the bathroom is pretty nice with a standup shower.
We didn’t need to use the 2nd cabin but it had enough room for another couple. The yurt also looked like a fun place to stay. The property is well maintained and has a koi fish pond. There was a thunderstorm and we saw a huge double rainbow afterward. We had planned to make a fire outside but didn’t have time with all the fun stuff to do in the area. We ate at a few restaurants downtown and all were wonderful. We visited Bearizona which was less than an hour away and a really neat lava park not too far away – Sunset Crater Volcano. We definitely recommend this place. Chris was very nice!"

Stayed a few nights","First, the scenery at this place is amazing. My Wife and 3.5-year-old Son shared this place with two other couples. One couple had a 1.5-year-old, and the other couple had an eight and nine-year-old plus an infant. My Wife and I got there early and were met by the owner's Wife. She was super nice, and gave a good run-down on the place. We were initially a little surprised when she told us her Son and Fiancé were staying in the cabin directly next to the main cabin and another family was staying in the Yurt. Not a huge deal, but it might be a deal breaker for other renters to know that the owner's Son is literally staying in a cabin about 25 feet away. I would inquire about this if you are interested in this rental property. In terms of the sleeping situation. The main cabin has a king bed in the master bedroom with a full-bath. The living room has a pull-out sofa about the size of a twin bed. Upstairs has a queen bed, and a pull-out sofa which is also about the the size of a twin bed. Upstairs has a full bathroom. The main cabin is nice. The kitchen had everything we needed. Moths/insects/flies were a bit of an issue, but the place is completely off the grid so it did not bother anyone. Downstairs in the main cabin it was easy to regulate temperature with the windows/verbal instructions the owner provided. However, upstairs was significantly warmer than downstairs, and it was borderline uncomfortable to take a nap upstairs and fall asleep at night. A fan upstairs is highly recommended. We stayed from 31 June - 4 July. The Wi-Fi worked great, but we never tested out the television. However, the main cabin did have some sort of satellite service. I would also inquire about the washer and dryer. The owner did not mention it, but the 9-year-old seemed to find his way past the locked door in the master bedroom where he discovered a utility room of sort with a washer and dryer. The outdoor patio was one of our favorite parts about the main cabin. During the day, and in the evening, it was great. There is a nice Weber grill and furniture to sit about 8 people. The other cabin was also neat, but is just a place to sleep. If I remember here is a queen or full bed plus a another twin size bed. There is no bathroom or shower in this cabin. Again the other cabin was occupied by the Owner's Son, and the Yurt was occupied by another family. The Owner's do not allow pets, however the other two couples we shared the place with brought their dogs. I told the owner this shortly after we arrived as soon as I found out the animals were coming. Understandably I could tell she was not pleased, but she was very understanding and allowed the two dogs to stay..."

Stayed a few nights","Thundercliffe Lodge is an authentic rustic yet immensely comfortable cabin nestled into the forest surrounding the highest mountain peaks of Arizona. Even in June snowy patches could be seen on Mt Humphrey. The location is superb for day trips to the Grand Canyon, Williams' Train Depot, Mystic Sedona, Native American ruins, and forest hikes galore. Only 20 minutes to downtown Flagstaff is a historic district of quaint shops with everything from handcrafts to luxury artworks. Our first night we had fish & chips at Collin’s Irish Pub, another night fine dining on linen tablecloths at Josephine’s Bistro. There are several microbreweries all within a walking distance, so pack comfortable shoes. However, you may never want to leave the lodge as it has everything to enjoy a respite in nature, the smell of pines, wildflowers and pond all attract deer, rabbits, birds (from hummingbirds to raptures) no binocular required; they are that close. Chris was an amazing host, friendly, accommodating and informative. He had recommendations to hikes off the beaten path with tips only locals know. An exciting plus for me was actually finding all 13 spices/ingredients right in the cabinet to make traditional Chai tea on the stove! Nothing beats sipping a warm drink from a pottery mug watching sunrise and set sitting on bent willow furniture in the middle of Thundercliffe’s ten acres. We loved it and hope to visit again."

Rich was very quick to communicate when we had trouble with the internet, but it turned out that the network instructions sent by message were incorrect, which one of us finally figured out. I would also like to add that something really should have been done about the very thick and big ice patch outside the door so no one slips (they had just had a big snowstorm so I'm sure not a problem usually).
I have given it very high ratings because it is really nice, quiet, and has a great little yard. The above comments are meant as suggestions. The beds were big and comfy - a huge plus for us!"

One of the cleanest we have been to! The library was awesome! And we enjoyed classical Christmas music in the vinyl player. I highly recommend this place! And we will return. Our host was responsive and great communication.

Stayed with a pet","Rich's place is the best!
It is extremely dog friendly. The small fenced in yard is amazing for dogs and offers peace of mind to let them roam around. Rich made a convenient blanket for the couch as well to protect the furniture.
Location is convenient! Super close to downtown. 15 min walk to all bars and restaurants or a $5 uber ride if you aren't up for walking.
Kitchen is great! Water temp and pressure in shower is great! WiFi is quick! Heating works amazing to keep you warm on cold nights!
Rich answers super quick if you have any questions.
The mattresses are very firm so if you can't sleep without a pillowy soft mattress, keep that in mind.
Amazing stay! This will be our place when we come back to Flagstaff!"

I chose Rich’s place mainly because I was bringing my son’s dog for a visit while he is studying at NAU, needless to say my son missed his buddy so much he stayed with him instead, but Rich’s place is very dog accommodating and I would choose it again for that! Loved our time in Flag and would happily stay at Rich’s place again."

The fenced in back yard was great for having my pup. I wish we could have made use of the nice back yard they have here. There was a fire pit, grill and chairs to hang out back there but it rained a lot while we were there so, next time! Highly recommend this home for anyone staying in flagstaff. Thank you, Rich!"

Rich thought of everything from extra doggy bags to clean up after our pups to sandwich baggies and spices in the kitchen. Hours after checking out my son realized he left his beloved stuffed animal up there and Rich found it and mailed it back to us right away. We'll definitely be back!"

Good little rock yard to let our dog go out on. The only reason it didn’t get five stars is I waited 45 minutes to get in due to a glitch getting door code. I tried all ways I could to get in touch with Rich. Almost canceled to go get a hotel when we finally figured out how by doing a deep dive to get the code.

Stayed a few nights","Rich’s Chalet recently completed construction and shares the lot with another of Rich’s lodgings, the Cottage.
Rich is very dedicated to making a stay at The Chalet the very best experience he can offer to guests. He seeks feedback on ideas that would improve a guest’s experience and is appreciative of suggestions.
That said, The Chalet is already a thoroughly comfortable, well appointed, and extremely charming lodging. It is spacious, clean, and features interesting objects for you to consider i.e. a turntable and vinyl records, and more. If Sheri and I could have had a copy version of The Chalet waiting for us at every stop on our road trip we would have been delighted.
We can’t say enough good things about our experience with Rich and The Chalet."

It had a nice fenced space to let the dog out, with a fire ring to enjoy the crisp evenings by. The compact kitchen was well appointed with cooking supplies and even had spices & storage containers - a bonus for us, as we love to cook family-style meals together on vacation. The cozy bedrooms had super-comfy, firm beds. We appreciated the efficient use of space, including the full laundry facilities.

Additionally, any questions we had for the owner were answered within the hour. We would definitely come back to this Airbnb."

The cottage was large and comfortable with separate living room, bedroom, a central kitchen and dining area, and a pleasant outdoor patio. EVERYTHING necessary was supplied, even coffee, creamers, sugar, Coffeemate, 2 coffeemakers, toaster, microwave, full fridge, stove… The kitchen is big enough and well-supplied enough to cook a full meal. The bed we slept in was very comfortable. The bathroom is small, but serviceable, with good hot water. Trevor was immediately responsive to our requests and questions and had compiled a book of house rules, places to eat, and things to do. Great place to stay. Will be back next time we’re in town!"

Street parking is free. Luckily, the parking space described in Trevor's instructions was available throughout our stay, as I had been told that there are no designated parking areas for each home.
Amenities and essential materials such as dishes, cutlery, bath soap, shampoo, tissue, paper towels, laundry soap, and dishwashing liquid were available to use. The beds were very comfortable, and the sheets were really clean. Having gameboards available was a plus for family game night. There is no air conditioning, but the electric fans were sufficient, given the relatively cooler temperatures at Flagstaff even during summer.
Overall, it's a great place to stay and return to in Flagstaff."

Stayed a few nights","The house is a great value for the buck. The house was clean and beds comfy. The space fits 5 perfectly. The outdoor space is cozy. The heater works excellent. The shower is small but has nice pressure and heat. There is no longer a graveled area to park. Bring golashes for rainy weather and snowboots during snow. Trevor might update the photos to show an updated exterior. The front door faces an unpaved alleyway and the red dirt is no one's friend. Trevor provides nice mats to act as a mudroom, a snow shovel and broom to keep things tidy. A grocery store is less then a mile, as is La Fonda, best Mexican eats in town. I truly enjoyed my week stay at Trevor's place. As i have family in the area, I will rent again."

Stayed with kids","Good -
1) The place has all the amenities and the host placed lot of attention to smaller details.
2)Bathroom was clean and well equipped; shampoo/shower gel weren't cheap ones.
3) Bed/Mattress/comforters/pillow was very comfortable (again not the cheap spring mattresses).
4) Kitchen was very clean with plenty of dishware/pots/pans etc.
5) Kids enjoyed board games, darts and cornhole. TVs has popular streaming services (youtube, netflix, prime) which was quite handy.
Not so good - Using the alley for getting in/out was horrible. As the snow melted, the alley became quite slippery (it may be due to construction next door) and we almost fell. Parking the car across the street didn't feel safe (especially since Sunnyside is not in the best part of the town). The house is small for a family of four (especially the shower)."

Stayed with kids","Trevor's place is comfortable and well equipped, with lots of thoughtful stuff included--Q-tips, hair elastics, coffee filters, and a generous supply of little coffee creamers, among other things. The kitchen area is huge. Trevor is a very responsive host. The location is convenient--access to the Arizona Trail is right across the street, Safeway is only a few minutes away, and downtown is about a 10-minute drive. The neighborhood is quiet. A few things to keep in mind: the shower is very small, parking is on the street (although there is plenty of space to park), and the driveway/alleyway that leads to the door can be icy and/or muddy. I've stayed here twice now, in summer and winter, and would definitely stay again. It's often the best Airbnb deal in town, from what I've seen."

Stayed a few nights","Nice little home in central Flagstaff! Trevor was very communicative and the place was perfect for a story stay as we visited the Grand Canyon area! The pics on the listing are bit outdated regarding the area around the unit (there’s some new construction now partially obstructing the unit which made it a bit hard to find — especially at night), but not a big issue at all. Overall would recommend if you’re looking for a good deal and a simple place to stay!"

Stayed one night","Good place to stay if you are looking to be outside of the hustle and bustle of Flagstaff. Quick drive to downtown but far enough to not be quite as busy. This space had everything we needed and was cosy but comfortable for a group of four friends who are quite close (shared bedroom made for a closer than typical sleepover style arrangement). There were some incredibly noisy neighbors up until 3am, but that was beyond the Host's control. The fans provided in the bedroom and living room did eventually provide enough white noise; wish we'd thought of that sooner. Otherwise, a very nice and simple place to stay! Parking on the street was not crowded at all"

Stayed a few nights","This property is Small but does a lot with the space provided. The kitchen was amazing and the beds were soft comfy and clean. The back patio is a little small but shaded and just enough space to play some games if you are bored. My only knock on this place is the construction that occurred during our stay on the next door house. The parking isn't great. especially if you're not from there. The listing states there are pictures to help but there are none. other than that, it was a nice small place to rest your head while you explore flagstaff."

We appreciated how all the toiletries were provided and there were extras of everything. There was a great TV in the bedroom and it was a very spacious place. We loved how comfy the beds were! The hot water in the bathroom sink didn’t turn on, it wasn’t a big deal but would have been nice to have advertised. The floors could have used a good mopping, we noticed it wasn’t the cleanest on the ground while walking around. It could have been because of the construction, but I couldn’t find the parking area that was advertised for us to park in. I parked just around the corner and that seemed to be fine. Overall it was a good stay and we enjoyed our time in Flagstaff! Lots of great hikes!"

One small thing: There's a bit of construction going on next door that started around 7am the Monday I was there, and this will of course be temporary (and this is no complaint to Trevor and this Airbnb of course, who were perfect by all accounts -- and they even thoughtfully left ear plugs for guests, should you need them). I only mention it for travelers who are especially noise sensitive -- or who, like me, sometimes get a little startled by new voices/sounds when traveling solo. All in all, I had a really great stay, and would recommend this spot to anyone!"

There is also a lot of great things to see out east in the Navajo nation that we didn’t have time for.

Stayed with kids","Had a great stay at Miguel’s flagstaff home. It was very clean and had all the basic kitchen necessities. Very modern but not baby friendly at all which is fine but something to keep in mind if you are planning on staying here with kids.
Another thing was the heater would shut off every night in the middle of the night. It would get very cold and my baby would wake up in the middle of the night crying. The temperature would drop 10-15 degrees colder than the temperature we had set it to before bed. We would have to get up and reset the thermostat so the heater would kick on. Other than that it was a great clean home and was close to a lot of great restaurants and grocery stores."

Stayed one night","Unfortunately I can't leave the 5 star review that I think this spot likely typically deserves.
We were initially very impressed and pleased with the space as it is cute, private, and just has that quality feel you'd expect with a nicer hotel room. However, later in our stay it became unequivocally obvious that the bed linens were not changed or washed prior to our arrival. The sheets presented as generally clean, however, after closer inspection it was obvious that there were loose body hairs and other debris on the surface of the fabric. We thought perhaps the hairs and debris we embedded from the wash machine but that was clearly not the case. The host apologized and helped resolve the issue, but unfortunately the issue is too egregious to leave a positive review. Obviously we don't know if this issue was simply a gross oversight of the cleaner or a result of intentional negligence, but nonetheless dirty linens is not acceptable at any establishment and greatly diminished the enjoyment of our evening.
Providing the host takes corrective steps to ensure this particular oversight does not happen again it would certainly be a great addition to anyone's itinerary."

Stayed a few nights","What a fantastic home with such an incredible host. This A-frame cabin in the woods just south of Flag is everything that is promised and so much more. The views, the coziness, the feeling of remoteness with accessibility, the accommodations, the consideration, the price, the cleanness - all FIVE STARS!! Andrew's awesome about responding to questions within an hour, and he's thought of everything for the house. All supplies were well-stocked, and my husband and I wanted for nothing. Just when we thought we had Andrew stumped, we found the coffee grinder after accidentally buying beans instead of ground coffee. (And that's only if you want your own - there are two coffee makers with more than enough coffee for both.) The house is SO clean with a ton of furnishings, blankets and pillows. Streaming TVs available and easy to use. You can trust that everything in the description and photos is true - in fact, it's a little understated. This cabin experience was nothing short of magical."

Stayed one night","Absolutely loved it! The kitchen is a dream with staples like oil, honey, hot chocolate (a must-have!), half and half, sugar, and two types of coffee machines. Every appliance you could need for breakfast or dinner is here, plus the cutest retro Galanz fridge and microwave, and top-of-the-line appliances. The decor is cozy yet modern industrial, featuring an old-time typewriter and metal shelving packed with games. Clever little blocks display WiFi codes and curated Spotify playlists for the Marshall Bluetooth speaker. Privacy is well thought out with an upstairs curtain and a downstairs accordion door. The bathroom had plenty of hot water, fluffy towels, and nice soap dispensers. Little tree faces and mushroom path lights add a whimsical touch to the clean and well-maintained home. Perfectly situated close to town for convenience, yet far enough for peace and privacy. Can't wait to stay here again!
Communication with the host was fantastic. They were responsive and exceptional!"

There was an immediate sense of calm and peacefulness upon entry. The A-Frame window provided us with an ever changing piece of art that hooked us in at many moments throughout the day. It’s evident that the hosts are well traveled, as they have equipped the home with countless thoughtful gestures and amenities that we didn’t even know we needed or wanted. Simple things (but appreciated!) like coffee and shower products. Creative ideas such as sensored lighting on the stairs and bathroom, a custom play list, and a scannable shopping list for all of the furnishings we will (have already) be ordering in an effort to replicate the tasteful style. We are committed to an annual trip A(if you’ll have us!), and in 10 years, will likely think of this as “our place” too. Congrats to you, Andrew on creating an amazing space to share."

Stayed a few nights","WOW! From the moment we walked in we felt at home. So much love and thought was put into every single detail/item in the home and it shows! I’ve seen and stayed at many airbnbs due to my profession and this one really checks all the boxes!!! The home was stocked with everything we needed to enjoy our weekend getaway including extra tooth brushes, toothpaste, cooking oils, nespresso pods, teabags, and so much more. We were blown away by the thought and care put in by these amazing hosts. Andrew was so friendly and quick to respond before, during, and after the stay. The balcony views are so beautiful and peaceful and the amenities were top notch! If you’re looking to get away and relax in Flagstaff, this is the home for you!"

Stayed a few nights","This A frame cabin was absolutely perfect! The interior looked exactly like the pictures. It was cozy and had everything we needed. The cabin was exactly as described and felt magical. We stayed here for 2 nights so that we could see the Grand Canyon one day and Sedona the next. It was the perfect location to do it all. This cabin is a perfect couples retreat and so picturesque. It snowed during our stay so the views out the floor to ceiling windows were gorgeous. The cabin was easy to get to and the instructions for check-in and checkout were clear and easy. Andrew is an extremely communicative and proactive host, ensuring that his guests have everything they need. He answered all my questions within minutes and sent timely reminders about check-in and checkout. This Airbnb is at the top of my list for Flagstaff and will definitely book it for future trips up this way. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in seeing Flagstaff, Sedona or the Grand Canyon. It’s well worth it!"

Not only is the Vista A Frame GORGEOUS inside and out, it had everything you could possibly need! The detailed thoughtfulness of Andrew as a host was impeccable, he truly anticipated our every need, and the cabin was stocked with everything and more. It’s a stunning cabin, beautiful decorated and created a homey and relaxing atmosphere to relax in! We were in love with this place, in awe of its aesthetic, architecture, cleanliness and overall vibe, we never wanted to leave. Definitely recommend anyone to stay and enjoy this lovely cabin, down to the cozy beds, natural light, AMAZING shower head, and every little detail that made this the perfect birthday weekend getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. Super excited to stay at this cozy A frame while it snowed. We were under-equipped for the icy hill up to the Airbnb, but with time and persistency, our front wheel drive made it. We were told by the owner before hand and even street signs that 4WD/AWD and chains are recommended, but we unfortunately did not have a vehicle with 4WD/AWD or could accommodate chains. The view from the hill was amazing and worth every penny! There is a wonderful Spotify playlist available to guests to listen to via QR code blocks and it fits perfectly with the vibe of the place. The owner did a phenomenal job accommodating guests that encourage a nice and relaxing stay. If you want a place with a view and makes you feel right at home, look no further."

The house was extremely clean, user friendly, and had a modern touch with the appliances. You can tell a lot of thought and care was put into the home to make the guests feel comfortable and cozy.
My family and I really enjoyed our stayed and were able to witness snowfall through the A frame windows, which was truly magical!
I highly recommend this air bnb and will be looking to book it again in the future!"

You can really tell a lot of thought went in to making sure guests have a nice and relaxing stay. The digital manual and instructions were really helpful and easy to follow.
It is located in a quiet area but still central to other tourist spots such as Downtown Flagstaff, Sedona, and the Grand Canyon. We also had nearby access to a small grocery store and gas station three minutes away! The interior of the cabin had multiple conversation spaces and nooks for some quiet time that would be perfect for a couple or family get away. There were so many personal details the host added that really elevated the whole experience of our stay! Whenever we had any questions the host was quick to respond and super friendly, we fell in love and will definitely be coming back for another stay! 10/10 highly recommended :)"

Stayed a few nights","During our recent stay at Trevor's place, we were thoroughly impressed. We were a group of three, and our primary objective was to work remotely while enjoying a comfortable and tranquil environment during a tour of NAU.
Trevor's property exceeded our expectations in a few ways. First is, its location. Nestled against a quarry, the property had no rear neighbors, ensuring complete privacy and a peaceful atmosphere. The neighboring properties on either side were quiet, contributing to a sense of serenity.
What set this place apart was its location in a safe neighborhood, free from any disruptive car or train noises. This allowed us to focus on our work during the day and enjoy restful nights. The inclusion of a mudroom and a decent backyard were practical and appreciated additions, offering convenience and outdoor relaxation.
The beds were comfortable, and the property was equipped with nearly everything we needed for our stay. Thanks, Trevor!"

There was a little quarry/hill behind the house that the kids liked to climb. It was tucked away in a quiet neighborhood but only a short drive (or walk) to a shopping center with grocery store. It was nice to have a garage to keep the car in so I didn't have to dig it out of snow. We definitely saved this place for our next trek up north from Phoenix. The host was very responsive and helpful but only needed to reach out a couple of times since everything was set up and laid out very nicely.
