Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed every second of the place, the hot tub, the canoe, the bon fire and grill. The place was very lovely! Especially at night! Did a little picnic on the deck and looked at the stars, so peaceful and lovely! Could even hear the donkeys communicate with each other lol. Our stay was very relaxing and comfortable! Definitely will come back! It’s a great gate away place."

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful rental, Tippecanoe river at the back of the property, if you had a canoe or kayak, you can drop it right in and float the river. 6 miles to Lake Manitou, if you have a boat, plenty of room in the driveway for it, quick drive to the lake. The house is nicely furnished, very cozy. The back patio is great. Private, plenty of seating, fire pit, weber gas grill, and a nice picnic table with umbrella to eat at. Great place for a family escape. We will definitely stay there again if we’re back in the area."

The house is decorated beautifully and stocked with everything we could possibly need. The coziness and comfort, exceptional!
The beautiful sunrise and sunset made our stay perfect!!
I want to give a bad review to keep others from booking Anna’s house so it will be available to me anytime I want it. But I just can’t do that.
10 out of 10, perfect score!!"

The lighting was lovely with views of both the sunrise and the sunset, a nice variety of birds to watch, and a nice open grassy area. We didn't have a chance to try out the boats, but if we'd had more time we would have loved to do that as well. The home itself was clean, welcoming, and cozy, and Anna was a wonderfully responsive and helpful host."

The kitchen had everything necessary for the private chef to prepare our brunch. The host was very pleasant and responsive. She provided the check-in instructions long before arrival which made getting settled even easier. I can’t wait until summer so that I can experience the lake house during the warmer season.

She checked in on us as we commuted to the location during a snowstorm. Also, she followed up with us as the weather temperature dropped to make sure we were comfortable. The serene location and home environment were conducive for us to finish our project and spend quality time with each other. I highly recommend this gem in Indiana for anyone who needs a break from city life. Thanks, Anna!"

It was such a treat when we watched two bald eagles land in the tree in the backyard, and we watched them dip down into the lake and catch fish. We definitely will be planning a trip back!

A couple bald eagles even flew by each morning! Bathrooms had plush towels and temperature precise controls in the shower. Low ceilings in some rooms downstairs but most of us were under 6’ so no problems for us. Took the kayak and paddle boat out and was a lovely time all around. A much appreciated relaxing weekend!"

The tranquil vibe is evident in this property. The check-in and check-out was so simple and easy to follow. The home was extremely clean and well stocked with needed items. One person in our party of 4 booked the Lake House for she and her husband in May for their anniversary because she loved it so much. It's a place that you'd just want to keep coming back to for a peaceful break. Not far away are different restaurants and quaint shopping as well. Anna, the host, is kind, helpful and very quick to respond to messages. Thank you for creating a place that provides a calm in a busy world."

Stayed with a pet","Thankful for Anna! We got there on Tuesday and check in was easy, and the house was adorable and clean! It’s been completely redone and it shows.
Unfortunately we woke up at 5am on Wednesday to no water, we didn’t let her know until around 9, and she replied almost instantly. She had the neighbor (handy man) over right away and he started to find out what needed to be done. Unfortunately we decided to head home due to us only being there for a day anyway, but she texted us when it was back on and said we could head back, but we were already home. She then let us know that we could come back any weekend for free. How AMAZING is that? We will definitely be booking again in the future. She was very sweet, and easy to communicate with.
Something to note that this is a lake that’s more for kayaking or boating, not really swimming. But we saw so much wildlife while we were there and the view is completely worth it.
Thank you Anna! Really!"

Whole place was for anybody who are to get away from World. Bathrooms are simply 5 star (or 7 star) luxury hotel bathroom, one had shower, the other had very nice deep bathtub, one of my nephew was not letting go that tub. All kitchen appliances' were new all new, amenities were enough for any group of people.

Bathroom space was a little small for a big guy but the shower and bath made up for that.
House is located in a neighborhood with children. Could hear them in the evening but not an issue and was quiet at night.
Overall a great stay and experience, much better than hotels I've stayed at. Will certainly be looking up Ashlee & Jon next time I return to New Castle."

My husband really appreciated the nicely stocked coffee bar:) I certainly appreciated him being able to get his coffee fix before venturing out!

Stayed a few nights","I was coming back into New Castle to visit my family and found this listing and thought it looked super cute. I am SO glad we ended up booking through Jon. The house was on a quiet street and was close to my parent's house and Road 3 (where a lot of restaurants are). The house matched the pictures on the listing. It was cute, comfy and was the perfect size! There was a huge backyard with a seating area, a workout room, a coffee area and dining room.
Jon was so great. He explained all the house rules, was SO responsive to my emails and just made me feel welcome and important. We've already talked about booking here again when we go back into town. The only ""complaint"" I had, which wasn't a big deal was the lights outside the front door were so bright that they attracted what seemed like all the bugs in the neighborhood. So I was constantly trying to rush in without letting anything in. But I did appreciate all that light when we first showed up after it was dark."

We were visiting for Ball State graduation weekend- great place and value to stay for family/friends visiting BSU (about 25 min drive to BSU from this house). Highly recommend if you are in the area, way nicer and value to have the comfort of a home vs a hotel room! Thank you Jon!"

Stayed a few nights","I honestly won't be able to say enough great things about the host and house! Jon responded right away with questions I had. He was so very helpful and kind. My daughter (22 years old) came with us on a quick trip from Maryland to Indiania to visit my mom. This was her first time ever staying at an Airbnb property. She asked me on the way why I don't like to stay in hotels. Well, the minute she walked in the door she realized why we don't. The property was so clean. As we walked around the house, we loved all the small things that were added to make you feel right at home. The decor was so beautiful, and the bed was amazing. So much I sent Jon a message asking him for the brand since I am in the market for a new bed myself. The small touch of having water bottles left on the table by the bed was such as sweet gesture. We are very happy that we decided to stay at this property for sure. Thanks again for everything!"

Top notch rental that would cost at least double if in a more touristy location. Our whole family (Mom, Dad, Teen,and 5th grader) loved it.
Definitely rent this house instead of a hotel if you happen to be in New Castle for any reason. You will not regret it."

When we returned from dinner on Friday evening there was a note and small space heater for the upstairs bedroom since the temperature was to drop during the night and the heater upstairs wasn’t working properly. She apologized for the inconvenience, but since all four of us suffer from hot flashes it wasn’t a problem for us. We look forward to returning next year!"

We pulled out their card table and had a late night family game of cards along with the microwave popcorn they left us (sorry about what got on the floor!). Debbie left plenty of coffee, water, a nice fruit assortment, and fresh banana nut bread. That was a great bonus!
We had busy days booked so were unable to take the option to enjoy the lake or their local restaurant recommendation but we really appreciated that they offered. I also appreciated the small things like a place to plug in your phone at the nightstand and a flashlight on each side of the upstairs bed. Great value for 3 bedrooms and a sitting area."

These are the kind of people that restore your faith in humanity. Space was as described, and I would stay again.

Stayed one night","This was the first time I used AIRBNB and I was so happy with my stay that I'm sure to use it again. As I was in the area for business, I didn't use the space as much as I would have if I brought my family. The upstairs bed was extremely comfortable. The Keurig and snacks were a very nice touch. The WiFi was fast enough that I could stream videos.
My hosts were much nicer than I expected. I didn't ask for a lot because the accommodations were great, but I believe they would have given whatever I needed. The breakfast in the morning was amazing! I was glad to sit at their table and talk with them. I enjoyed their company and wished I would have talked with them the night before to get to know them better.
The only thing I would recommend is more security on the doors. I would have liked a keypad or key to my area, and a bolted lock on both sides of the door between their living area and the rented area. There was a lock, but I'd like to see a dead bolt, one for each side to prevent unwanted intrusion from either party. However, I would have to add that the house was probably the safest in the neighborhood because a police officer lives across the street.
Overall, well done and I hope to stay at your place again Debbie!"

I am not sure that I have adequate words to describe the hospitality that we received on this stay. loved the location off of the lake, the boating that Gary so graciously offered my family, the warmth and southern hospitality feeling we received. The beds were incredibly comfortable. I know we will come back again. It's not fancy, but if you want a comfy stay with the feel of a loving home with great hosts, this is the place for you!"

Walked around the neighborhood with my three little granddaughters and enjoyed my time wish I would have snagged it sooner so I could have gotten it the whole weekend since I was in town for graduation. Very nice and clean place. Loved it, would definitely stay again."

Stayed about a week","We visited New Castle to meet our new grand baby. Jon & Ashlee’s place is cozy, clean, comfortable and perfect for the two of us. We arrived on a late flight but the porch light and inside lights were on to safely greet us. If the weather had been a bit warmer it would have been an easy walk to Pizza King, Jacks Donuts, and Dairy King. Anderson Casino was also a quick 30 minute drive. The provided washer and dryer were super convenient and allowed us to travel with only carry on luggage. As avid coffee lovers the large drip coffee pot and Nespresso machine were also an added bonus! The king size bed was also very comfortable for both of us (hard to find in an AirBNB)! We will be visiting New Castle quite often so Jon & Ashlee’s place will always be our first pick for accommodations!"

I parked in the street which was close to the front door. With all my triathlon stuff, it was convenient and easy to go back and forth getting ready for the event.
The about 25 minute drive North to the transition was peaceful with almost no traffic. (Unlike the traffic coming from Muncie)
It was great! Happy I stayed there!"

They have gone top of the line in all appliances, bedding, amenities, even supplies in the closet! Jon and Ashlee responded immediately to our needs. Checking in during daylight is always preferable - we arrived in the dark and while the porch light was on, the address numbers are dark and on the opposite side of the light and the door, so was difficult to see, but that's a 'one off' situation! We will come back here again and again, as I have family in the area."

The only thing I'd want to note is that, if you have a sensitive nose, it's possible the well water might cause some frustration. Inevitably it would occasionally smell very faintly of sulfur, but that's just part and parcel of using well water and I don't hold it against the owners."

Stayed with kids","This was our first Air BNB experience as we have always stayed at a hotel which was probably 20 minutes away. We stayed at the same hotel a couple times a year for the last 8 or so years. Our last stay was horrible. Broken outlets, broken shower & rooms were dirty. Their loss is Tim's Country Homes gain. Plus it is closer to our family. When we first pulled in you could feel the calm of his land. I knew if the outside was this inviting the inside had to be just as good if not better. The house was perfect. There was enough room for everyone to have their own space. The kitchen has probably everything you have at home. Even had a “junk drawer” with pens, paper & even a chip clip. There was a paper that explained the house rules & general info. It was easy to read and explained how to use the TV & how they wanted us to leave the house. We did not spend as much time there as I would have liked but we will be back. I cannot recommend Tim's house enough."

The home was located in an area with lots of things to see and do as well as great places to eat. We also cooked at the home with all the amenities at our fingertips. Private setting was perfect for four friends to hang out and eat drink and be merry, without bothering anyone. The outdoors were beautiful and we even took a walk on the trail through the woods. Waking up in the morning to the horses out the back patio door was a nice way to start the day. We can not say enough about how happy we were with our experience.
We wished this home was closer as we highly recommend it and will definitely go back again when headed that way."

Listening to the creek babble while sitting outside was our favorite part. There was also a very friendly cat who did his part to make us feel right at home and the chickens out front were a nice touch too."

We were greeted by their two lovely outdoor cats who became fast friends of ours. We sat around the bonfire practically all day, with the cozy outdoor lights on. We cooked over the bonfire, read, did puzzles, all while listening to the chickens in their coop. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a peaceful place to unplug!"

I didn’t have much time to read about this one ahead of time, but I booked it because I read “shed.” I’ve overnighted in just about every situation, but never a shed.
What I had for just one night was a very cozy, peaceful, and extremely enjoyable escape.
Thank you, Kurt & Heidi, for taking care of every detail and providing a haste-free experience in a lovely setting."

If you want a peaceful, cozy spot to tuck away from the buzz of everyday life, you can't go wrong with Kurt and Heidi's place. It's close to town amenities yet located in country surroundings within a quiet neighborhood we felt safe in. We weren't sure what the compost toilet experience would be like, but it was super user-friendly, no pun intended, and only added to the experience. It's clear Kurt and Heidi put thoughtful effort into making their place and our stay special. Everything was as advertised and then some."

The cats are super friendly and greeted me each morning which was very sweet. Unfortunately, my stay called for wet and cold weather but I think the fireplace and the extended grounds close to the creek would've been a great place to enjoy the surroundings and reflect on life. I really enjoyed the photo book detailing how the shed came to be, as well as perusing the several games and books inside the cabinet. This would be a great getaway for couples as there were several books/games available to re-get to know each other and share with each other. I would definitely recommend this location for couples. It's also close to Warsaw which has a cute lake and stores to explore."

A simple getaway, thoughtful hosts, a unique setting, and absolutely adorable accommodations. This visit called for poor weather, so Kurt and Heidi set up the garage with some indoor games for the kids and I to play so we wouldn’t be bored—I call that definitely going above and beyond. It was well appreciated and they truly are the sweetest hosts. 100% would recommend. Also to note is the adorable downtown area, library with community garden, several Little Free Libraries in the area, and a bomb thrift shop that my daughter and I discovered. ♥️"

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shed Retreat. It was evident that a lot of care and thought has gone into making this little space as comfortable and welcoming as possible. For us, this stay checked all of our boxes, particularly being simple and affordable. The bathroom situation (toilet and shower outdoors) was no problem for us, and even added to the fun of our stay. I found myself especially appreciative of the house robes and shoes provided for our use - they made walking to the bathroom or using the shower a lot cleaner and easier than it could have been. Although we didn't meet Kurt and Heidi face to face during our stay, they were always quick to respond to questions, and available to help. I could certainly see us staying at the Shed Retreat again in the future. As parents it was the perfect little space to get away and reconnect for a couple days, without breaking the budget. We really appreciate what Kurt and Heidi have done with the space, and love that they've made it available."

A very calm and friendly kitten around makes a greater feeling and morning wake-up call from roosters. The place is cozy and perfectly cleaned by Kurt & Heidi. With provided few kitchens and game accessories it will be great fun.
As the trail leads into a nice creek in the backyard, it will be a great time to spend around in the entire day time in the woods. Definitely love to visit this place again. Bottom line, if you are a true lover of nature then this is the PERFECT PLACE for your pleasant stay....!!!!!"

Stayed one night","What a cute and cozy little apartment in a peaceful setting, complete with a couple of really friendly cats and lovely chickens! The shed itself was warm, inviting and smelled wonderful inside. The hosts leave you to your own devices and honor privacy, while still responding quickly to communication through the Airbnb app. The toilet arrangement (a camp toilet outside and one you can take inside) most certainly isn’t for everyone. It was a little hard to handle at times, but certainly didn’t take away from my total experience. Also, because of the time of year, the outdoor shower on premises was not available (there are showers available at a local rec facility for a modest fee). If you can put up with these minor points, I would enthusiastically recommend this location to anyone visiting this area!"

I felt tranquility and peacefulness listening to the creek babble as I took in the vibrant Fall colors. The crunch of the leaves a few steps down a cute wooded path made me reminisce my childhood growing up in Michigan. At night, the fire pit area was illuminated and beautified by adorning lights- like fireflies of summers past. The kittens sat in my lap purring me awake the next morning while enjoying coffee out front on the deck. Kurt and Heidi hit the nail on the head with the details of my new escape. They pray for those who find their way to the Shed. And pray for you while you’re here. And my soul could feel their healing words. Thank you so much for sharing this sacred space."

Stayed a few nights","The Shed Retreat is a little room in a beautifully peaceful setting out in the country. It's kind of a cross between a guest cottage and camping. The Shed itself is relatively close to Kurt & Heidi's house, yet is situated so it's surprisingly secluded and private, so it really IS perfect for a retreat.
Personally, my favorite part about my 2-night stay was probably just sitting inside, reading, writing, and coloring, with the windows open to let in the cool, fresh air. I also enjoyed an evening campfire (ate too many s'mores), walking down to the creek and the green grassy area (early a.m. squats & lunges), gathering fresh eggs, and practicing some ""kitten yoga"" (didn't know that was a thing, but the little grey guy thought I should try it).
The outside restroom is relatively convenient, clean, and comfortable. I feel that guests should be aware in advance that they are asked to do some of their own ""maintenance"" of the camp toilet, and that was not at all a problem for me.
Heidi and Kurt went out of their way to help me with a problem that came up (which was not related to their property), and I'm so appreciative of their assistance.
I didn't experience much in the town of North Manchester, but I did visit the History Museum, which was interesting and informative, and the Main View restaurant where I had a delicious lunch.
I hope I get an opportunity to stay at The Shed sometime in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a terrific experience at the Shed. Went looking for a weekend away to enjoy the pleasures of camping but also have a bed and room at night. My kind of glamping! Kurt and Heidi were so thoughtful - welcome cupcakes and a note on the bed when I arrived. The room was comfortable and adequate. Firewood ready for a campfire. Instructions and anything I needed to know was communicated well. They were sweet to say hello and visit but also considerate to give me space. Lots of options for simple fun. I checked out the fitness center one day. Walked downtown North Manchester for ice cream another day. And enjoyed reading and several cups of coffee by the fire. The chickens, fresh eggs and adorable kitties just added to the charm of the experience. Price was right and well worth it! Thanks Kurt and Heidi!"

We have never been camping before and this little glamping getaway was a perfect introduction, featuring an outdoor toilet and shower. The toilet was easy to use and very clean, as was the shower.

Stayed one night","If you like ""glamping"" this place is for you! It was an oasis of serenity and beauty, nestled in a sweet garden of hostas and shady trees. The chickens are near the parking and their sweet soft noises greeted us as we entered the very short path to the beautiful converted goat shed. If those goats could see this place now, they'd be in awe of it! The decor inside is darling and it had everything you needed, including A/C, electricity, a nice comfy chair, coffee table and love seat sitting area. The large bed was extremely comfy and the pillows were perfect. Rubber slippers, towels and bathrobes were provided near the back door for use in the very private outside shower. There is a camp toilet which along with the foot pump sink is part of the ""glamping"" experience that made this a fun adventure. From the cupcakes that greeted us to the fresh eggs we cooked in the barn for breakfast, we couldn't have asked for more! Oh! We also were over the moon visiting with the sweetest momma cat and her five adorable kittens!!! If we could have adopted any, we would have begged for at least two. It will be one of the best places you can find to stay in Indiana and I guarantee you won't want to leave!"

The hosts are beyond friendly, the cats (and now kittens as well!!!) are just adorable and so playful, and the setting is peaceful and just enough off of the beaten path to feel sort of camp-y in a very glamp-y way. My 15 year old daughter didn’t want to come previously because of the outdoor restroom (🙄😐). She, for some reason, chose to come this time and now said she will come every chance she gets. If this place can win over the pickiest teenager in the world, I’d say it’s whatever level comes after “winner”! 😋😉💕"

If you’re not a fan of cats, though, this may not be the spot for you. There are a ton of friendly cats (and kittens) that accompanied me throughout my time outside. I found them endearing, but someone afraid (or allergic) to cats may find that less than relaxing. Definitely would recommend this spot!!"

There were so many small touches that made the trip extra special too--like a welcome note with homemade cookies and a note on a book of questions inviting us to get to know each other better. My wife fell in love with Nala, one of their kittens, who was a great hammock snuggle buddy! Kurt was especially attentive and communicative--transporting our farmer's market goods (There is a wonderful farmer's market in town on Saturday mornings!) for us when he noticed that we had bought a little too much to carry back with us to the shed with the bikes that he lent us. We also really enjoyed, and recommend, the kayaking trip! (This would be at a small extra cost and includes kayaks, paddles, life jackets and drop off / pick up.) It was all just what we needed to get away from everyday life!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was an amazing retreat into nature and simple living. If you need to clear your mind, get in touch with yourself, focus on art or meditation; this is the place for you. The hosts were so kind and the amenities were unbelievable for the price and quality of the place. I recommend bringing your own grill and food to cook on site. There is a great farmers market in the town on Saturday morning, but otherwise healthy convenient food choices are slim. The camping toilet is really the only rustic part of the amenities so you should be prepared to take care of your own waste. There are some beautiful state parks in the area you can drive to for hiking trails and nature time. The best part by far was meeting the hosts and going on the kayak adventure; they provided the kayak and the drop-off/pick-up. The river was beautiful with a good mix of challenging and relaxing sections which made for a perfect true adventure. Thank you so much Heidi and Kurt for the love and kindness you put into this retreat."

There wouldn't be a single thing we would change with our stay and we plan to return again in the future! You will not be disappointed!

Stayed with kids","Such an incredible experience. We are AirBnB host and vacate our home every weekend. Kurt and Heidi’s place offered everything our family needed. We were able to set up a tent right outside the shed, which gave us a little more space to play with. Our two year old twins had a sandbox and swing set to keep them busy. We enjoyed a fire and tenting as if we were camping, yet with the comfort of a stylish and comfortable place to sleep. The shed was separated from the main house by a garage, which had a refrigerator for us to keep milk cold. There was running water and electricity. Also within a mile of a cute little small town and yummy Mexican!"

We were warmly welcomed with hellos and blueberry muffins!"

Stayed with kids","My oh my. Rod's place is not only a beautifuly reconditioned Industrial space, but an Art gallery as well. Read his BIO and it explains what I mean.
Entry is easy, lock box and complete instructions. Rod, even sent pictures to help guide us from the street. The stairwell to the 2cd floor is very wide and easy to navigate.
Once inside you have 12' ceilings (at least) and the revamped industrial vibe without being sterile and too modern. CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN. The bathrooms, the floors, everything.
A family of could easily stay her, the kitchen is lovely and well equipped. Even has a dishwasher.
If you are in New Castle, you will miss out if you do not stay with Rod. He himself seems like a charming man and I hope we meet at some point."

The unit itself nicely was very clean and furnished with comfortable furniture and beds; the kitchen had everything necessary to prepare snacks or meals. Coffee shops were very close by, but plenty of coffee and tea choices in the cupboards made staying in our go-to for morning beverages. Definitely will be our home away from home when we're back in New Castle."

This unit is centrally located to where we have hosted several celebrations at the 1414 Venue & I found Rod's space by mistake but will be returning when I'm in town. Friendly and mindful of the event & even let us late check out because we were able to do table linen ironing and some cooking for the event in the unit. You will not be disappointed with the value you get in this property.

I knew New Castle before....but had no idea it could look (and feel!) like this! The Loft is beautiful and welcoming. The porch, the fresh air, and the hummingbirds, alone, are worth it.

From waking up early and seeing the deer come out of the surrounding woods to feed on the corn that they provide, to the beautiful sunrises and the cardinals and blue jays that continue to swoop in for the left over corn, it is evident that Gods peace, beauty and creation is surrounding you.
The Loft is Cozy, comfortable, relaxing, and so peaceful. It is just a short drive into town for dinner or shopping.

Stayed a few nights","I can’t express how wonderful this property is. It’s all the beauty of what Henry county is, without the gloom. It’s perfectly clean and so charming. We typically stay in Indy and go back and forth, this was so much better. We stay at air bnbs at least once a month. This has been the homiest. So clean and everything I wanted or needed was there. Communication couldn’t have been better. Their property was extravagant, and the views. Actually wish it had been August to see the fields. I’ve lived in the south a long time, but staying here was every good memory I have growing up. The smell of fresh cut grass, the sound of the birds, and the views of country. Thank you Stephanie. 5 plus stars all around."

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Jeff’s place was delightful! The space was very lovely, sparkling clean, stylish, and incredibly comfortable, providing a peaceful retreat in an upscale and quiet neighborhood. Waking up to the morning view from the bedroom window, overlooking the serene woods, was the perfect way to start each day.
The neighborhood is charming and welcoming, adding to the overall positive experience. The tranquility and beauty of the surroundings enhanced our stay and allowed us to unwind and relax in a serene environment. We enjoyed using the grill that is just outside of the apartment.
All the amenities look exactly like in the pictures in the listing. Everything is provided, just bring your shampoo and body wash.
The location is convenient if you need to get to downtown, Kroger, or even Summit Lake State Park. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a cozy and peaceful getaway in a lovely neighborhood."

I am in town for work, short term, and had been paying roughly 1500 to stay. Christmas roles around, and they charged me an additional 1000 without any notification. Went back and forth with AirBNB to no avail. Hannah and Scott were also dumbfounded as to why I was charged so much. Will not be using AirBNB for future stays, whether for work or pleasure."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay here for the solar eclipse. It's a large property in beautiful Amish farm country. Very quiet and peaceful. I could hear the faint clop-clop of horse drawn buggies on distant roads, and the railroad couple miles away. Far enough from big cities that you can see many stars.
Apartment is very nice and cozy size for 1 or 2 (400 sq ft). Furnishings comfortable. Kitchen well equipped -- full size fridge / freezer, microwave, toaster oven, K-cup. No stove but didn't miss it. Kitchen well stocked w essentials and snacks. Everything clean. Dish TV and WiFi worked well. You can park right at the door & only 2 steps up into the space. The rest of the building is a large workshop -- all very quiet.
Hosts live in the main house and are very friendly, helpful, and easy to reach. Home-cooked meals and pies were delicious and unexpected. I felt very welcome. Hosts appear new to AirBnB but I can't think of anything to improve. Hope to return someday. Highly recommended!!!"

I cannot say anything negative about this house or the owners as it was the best rental I've stayed at in a long time with the best owners. It's exactly where I want to be next time I'm traveling to New Castle, unless the owners add properties to their portfolio, and if they do.. I'd be happy to stay there as well!

Stayed with kids",Our family of 6 has done a lot of traveling and air BnB stays in the last 3 years. This place was perfect for our family and the little extra touches were noticeable and made the experience really great. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a water bottle placed on every night stand to quench our thirst in the middle of the night. What a great added value! Very comfortable beds and a great night sleep. Would recommend this place for sure 👍

Stayed with kids","We only stayed a single night on our way driving through from the east coast to Kansas, but we really enjoyed Jon & Ashlee's place. Everything was really well designed and well decorated, and we enjoyed flipping through the cool coffee table books all around the place. The town isn't right on I-70, but it was a surprisingly easy and quick to get to and from the highway from the Airbnb. I'm not sure exactly what the town has in it, but if you find yourself in town or passing through near by, we'd definitely recommend this Airbnb.
Also, I stupidly left something in the Airbnb and they were kind enough to promptly look for and ship me the item."

Stayed one night","Wow! What a gem tucked in a cute residential neighborhood! We were traveling cross country and needed a place with multiple bedrooms to accommodate our group for an overnight stop. We found this listing and were drawn to the photos and listing. What a joy it was to see the place matched everything described!
This sweet bungalow is on a quiet residential street near the cute downtown.
Off-street parking and super easy entry and we were inside this impeccably decorated home. The hosts have amazing design taste- clutter free but with cute touches that create a cozy space. They thought of everything- comfortable bedding, nice towels, phone chargers and extension cords, cozy lighting, water on nightstands, coffee station and extra drinks in fridge, throw blankets on the couch and a great TV setup. Be sure to spend time on the back deck- at night to enjoy the lighting and in the morning like I did with my cup and coffee and book. Stay here! You’ll love it"

With that said, this location meets and surpasses the standard I am accustomed to. The hosts are amazing with communication. The house is spotless. There is not a detail missed. The kitchen is beyond well-stocked. We were able to cook meals and could have baked a cake if needed!
We will be back.
If you are in the New Castle area, book it unless I'm trying to get a reservation!
Thank you for a great place to stay!!"

Jon was flexible and responsive when our plans changed and communicated well throughout our stay. The cleaning fees were modest which is one of the things we look for when we travel on AirBnB.

My husband and I have three grown children who also have significant others. We had plenty of room for all seven adults. Since there are three floors, we felt we had privacy from each other as well.
The water is shallow by the pier, so getting our kayaks in and out was easy. We noticed the rocks are sharp so bring water shoes if you plan to swim by the pier.
Overall, this is a great family vacation spot!"

Stayed a few nights","Great views of the lake whether sitting inside or hanging out of the large deck, which was a wonderful place to relax. Loved having the dogs with us, the fenced yard was big plus. If you wish to have some swim time with your dogs, be aware that having a sea wall means there is no beach for them to easily get out of the lake - so you're only option is to lift them out and, due to the height of the pier, there is at least 3 feet between the pier and the surface of the water - that's a long way to lift a 40 lb dog. The lake bottom is not sand, so your feet sink and you have no leverage to lift from underneath. Other than that challenge, we had a wonderful time at the lakehouse. It's a beautiful property. Convenient access to restaurants and grocery - we especially loved Rochester Bagels & Harvest Moon. Communication and response from the hosts was great."

Stayed a few nights","The owners have created a space that is right on the water and is perfect for a weekend away with friends or even a small family. The house is so cute (just as described), is cozy (offering multiple rooms and accommodations for both children and adults) and is so serene (sitting on the water with minimal noise around). The location is perfect for hearing the sound of water, nature and passing boats. There are also a few classic games in the closet for entertainment if you are taking a step away from technology (though a tv is provided in the basement). The owners have also provided a few recommendations regarding local excursions and food that are spot on. No regrets regarding this reservation and would book it a gain in the future. Grateful to the owners for creating a space for guests to enjoy nature and a quaint community."

Group trip","Site is exactly as shown. Very clean. Right on the water. It was very relaxing laying on the big blue float mat that was available for use. Neighbors were friendly with a wave and general quick small talk, but did not hover. Feels very secluded but just a few minutes from stores etc. My family thought it was perfect for a water front get away. |f you have issues with steps, the spiral staircase in the house is a little challenging, but if you don't need tv you can manage everything on the main floor."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was basically clean when we arrived. However, it was not a comfortable space. The two dining chairs were bar height and have no back. The two chairs in the “living room” are uncomfortable. So there was no place to relax. Neither tv worked - not sure if it was batteries for the remotes or another issue. We did not pursue it because neither was located such that it would be easy to relax and watch tv. Half of the windows lacked screens. We needed to open the windows to air the space out because the air chemical smell was overwhelming when we walked in. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone with respiratory issues, limited mobility (because of the stairs), or a family because of lack of seating or spaces for children or even two couples. This was disappointing. On the plus side it is right downtown."

Both bedrooms are really spacious. They are a few weird things. One in the bathroom whatever they were doing yo the wall below the towel rack. They is also a space I guess for a washer and dryer hook up that’s open. Overall I loved the decor, the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with appliances and items for cooking."

There are many small attention to details, like extra soap in the bathroom, spices to cook with, hangers in the closet, a drying mat for dishes and ice cube trays filled up ready to use. The beds were super comfortable and clean. Lots of extra pillows and blankets in the closets
Overall we loved our stay, the location is perfect and so close to a lot of places. Walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, the art park and local library. We Will be booking this place again next year when visiting our family."

We had a few minor complaints such as lack of curtains in the bedrooms to prevent the bright lights from Main Street stream into the rooms at night and there not being enough wash cloths for the length of our stay. Besides those few minor items, we would stay here again based on location alone.
My suggestion is to bring a sleep mask and some coffee to brew in the keurig!"

It is very well-equipped with all you need from kitchen utensils to bed linens towels, blankets etc. It is also very spacious in terms of dining room, living room, and kitchen which makes it flexible in case you happen to come with a larger family. All bathrooms including laundry are all very well equipped with toilet paper, towels, and a few hygienic products. Every room has a TV which makes it entertaining for family time and for the little ones. Lastly, the house has more than enough space on the backyard which would be very nice to use during the summer time.

The house was sparkling clean. Each room was decorated in farmhouse style, with well made and comfy furnishings. We cooked all of our meals in the kitchen and there was never a tool we could not find! We also enjoyed the large fireplace in the living room every night!
Outdoors, our grandson enjoyed running outside and fell in love with the swing!
This was a perfect place for our family to slow down, reconnect, and beat the winter blahs."

The house offers the best of everything. It’s a home away from home with so much of space for kids to play around. Everything was so aptly marked for the guests which was quite impressive. The pictures of the home don’t do justice.
What to say about their wonderful hospitality. The host was super responsive and addressed our concerns. We enjoyed the sweet corn ( right from their farm ) offered to us by Daniel. Daniel was super nice and told us about the interesting history of the house. Also helped us fix the wifi issue we experienced.
I would definitely recommend this to our friends. It was not just stay , it was an experience!!"

Stayed a few nights","We just finished staying here for the second time: and we'll probably come back again one day, because we can rely on the Cessna House at Oak Grove Place to be everything an Airbnb should be. The house is spotlessly clean, the hosts are extremely responsive (they live right next door), and there are a lot of nice extras like the farm-fresh eggs they provide when you check-in and the chickens that wander the property. Check-in is a breeze, they just send you the code and you type it on the keypad.
It's not the most exciting part of Indiana, but we were able to do an aggressive tourist schedule that involved visiting the nearby cities of Wabash (site of a 1826 treaty between the US govt and Indians and the first city with electric lighting), Marion (hometown of Garfield creator Jim Davis), Peru (home to a US Air Force museum with Cold War bombers), Kokomo (where the first car in America was built), Logansport (nice hiking trails along the river), Warsaw (a beautiful city between two lakes), and a few others, all of which were within a 45 minute or so drive. We even took a day trip to Indianapolis, though that was a 2 hour drive one way.
Of course if you just wanted to relax inside your entire stay, the house is great for that too. There are a million DVDs and the internet connection is good."

The master suite was absolutely amazing! Not only huge, but it had a private bathroom with a deep jacuzzi tub that melted all my stress away. The beds was comfortable.
Our family had a blast playing the Wii, watching movies from the very large selection. The table in the dining room was perfect for family dinners and board games. We also spent a lot of time having friendly competitions of pool, foosball, checkers & shuffle board.
All the thoughtful things the host did just put it over the top- from farm fresh eggs in the fridge to the beautiful Christmas decorations & tree to the firewood ready and waiting for the beautiful fireplace.

They have eggs from their chickens in the fridge, coffee, little cereals and tons of other stuff at your disposal. They have a grill and everything needed for any sort of cooking. Although we didn’t use any there are two fully stocked fire wood piles for the indoor fireplace and the outdoor fire pit. The games available at the house is such a great touch. So many game boards, Nintendo Wii, shuffle board, pool, foosball, washers etc. 4 bedrooms with all nice size beds and 3 showers is another great feature of this place. No one is on top of each other at all. Big finding room table and endless places to sit whether you’re indoor or outdoor you pretty much can always be comfortable.

The huge backyard gave plenty of space for our three young children to run around chasing chickens and burning energy on a swingset, tetherball, woods to explore and (add-on) bounce house. The fire pit was excellent and i spent hours every night watching the sun set and playing old honkytonk tunes on the acoustic.

The fridge was stocked with basic food (including farm fresh eggs from the chickens that roam the property) and the kitchen was stocked with all the cooking utensils and tools you can think of. There were also a lot of thoughtful touches like games, books, and toys. The backyard is huge and contained, among other things, swings and a tether ball. This house could easily and comfortably fit a large party, and having it all to ourselves made me and my wife feel like the king and queen of Indiana.

Group trip",We stayed for a work trip with multiple crews. Daniel's place was amazing all around. We even had a guys truck break down and they even lended a hand and offered their supplies and time to get him back on the road for work. We could never appreciate them more than any place we have stayed for work trips in Indiana! We stay for a week at a time each week. Beautiful historical home in a country setting to relax after a long day of work. By far the best yet!! All around!!! We will be back any chance we get as long as they have us!!

The house itself is an historic older home that has been completely renovated with modern amenities without losing its charm. We had five adults and five children ranging ages 16 to 7. We were very comfortable and the pool table, foozball table, and shuffleboard game are a definite plus!
I give this destination my highest recommendation!"

The kitchen worked great for fixing Thanksgiving and it was nice to have the extra sink in the laundry room to help with dishes. It was good for Dad as well. He managed the three steps like a champ and having a bathroom on the first floor helped a lot.
We hope to schedule a long weekend in the spring so we can take advantage of the fire pit!"

There was a huge table to play games and a big tv with a large selection of movies. Three full bathrooms was a luxury and one even included a spa tub.

The entire house and property was very clean, the house smelled very clean and welcoming. All of the beds were comfortable and all the linen was very clean and smelled great. There was not one fault with the cleanliness of this place. There were so many amenities provided that we didn’t want for anything for our comfort at all, they thought of everything.

It was very neat and clean, and had all sorts of special amenities, like farm fresh eggs in the fridge, plush rocking patio chairs on the front porch, and beautiful views across the fields. My wife and I grew up in a rural setting. And Oak Grove Place was a wonderful return to all those feelings and memories. The owner was very kind, friendly, and helpful when we needed him. Check in was super easy. And we had all the privacy we were looking for in a country setting. Our stay was just the sort of quiet and restfulness we were looking for. We were able to find classic town diners and burger joints in downtown Rochester in the evenings -and ice cream shops too! Will definitely return in the future. A perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle."

We had a blast playing shuffleboard and pool downstairs during the rain, and soaked up the sun and privacy outside when the weather was nice. There’s a fire pit, with everything you need to get it going so bring stuff for s’mores! Great for a big family or a couple just looking for some peace and quiet.

Stayed a few nights","Daniel's family was a pleasure to interact with and made sure everything went perfectly. The house is just far enough outside of town to be a quiet getaway, but close enough for easy access to stores and restaurants.
The kitchen, bathrooms, and living spaces have all been nicely renovated and updated. Some of the original farmhouse features have also been preserved, such as the pocket doors to the front seating area and much of the woodwork around the house. There is a roomy deck and backyard with a grill and fire pit which would be enjoyable in the warmer weather. With the amount of space in and outside of the house, Daniel's place is a great option for families. Daniel's family also left some delicious farm fresh eggs from their chickens.
Highly recommended and in my opinion a much better value and experience than staying in a motel in town. I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in the Rochester area."

Stephanie and I have some mutual local friends. They all spoke so highly of her that I felt like I had known her all my life.

The style mimics my house so it was perfect. The king bed was surprisingly comfortable. I stay in hotels every week so a comfortable bed is very important and rarely found.

Stayed a few nights","My second stay in Hagerstown at one of her locations, I love it. Anytime that I’m visiting that area for work. I’m going to be staying at one of available Airbnb’s. ￼ W￼ithin walking distance of willies and reds. Also in a really nice part of town. Thanks for a great stay!"
