Stayed a few nights",I loved my stay at Angela and Dean’s! They have truly created a special place in an absolutely beautiful part of the world. It is obvious that they love to host and share their home with guests. They are friendly and welcoming. I felt spoiled by their gifts and hospitality. The bed was divine…so plush and comfortable! I spent every evening soaking in the claw foot tub and mornings outside on the balconies. I can’t wait to return!

Stayed a few nights",Angela and Dean were wonderful hosts. They warmly welcomed us and made us feel at home. The upstairs was really nice and clean. Everything is clean and they have everything we needed. They even provided a gift bag for us upon entering the room. Can’t say enough about the stay. Look forward to returning!

Stayed a few nights","When we mentioned it was our anniversary trip, Angela and Dean not only gave us personalized welcome notes but also wrote a card and gave a gift. The Tuscany home was gorgeous. When we opened the door to the garden suite, it took our breath away. The room, kitchen and bathroom were warm and welcoming. Each door we opened outside went to a beautiful balcony. Both Angela and Dean were so friendly to talk to. They really wanted us to have the best experience possible. If you are booking your stay with them, you might want to book an extra day."

Angela and Dean are ridiculously generous and will treat you like family, if you let them. These two went absolutely above and beyond to make me feel at home."

Stayed a few nights","If you're using this website...looking for a place to stay where it's more like home, where the owners treat you like a person instead of a key holder, where you can relax and wind down when you travel...you already know what's important to you. But there's one thing that gets all too quickly ignored in the 'must haves': the quality of the people hosting. Angela and Dean, *without exception*, are the hosts you are looking for.
This is my second visit in the last 6 months. They did such a great job this fall I had to return this time. This trip, however, was a nightmare everywhere outside of the Villa: car rental issues, unexpected and unplanned costs...you name it. But Angela found me resources, put me in touch with great, local people to help me, and supported me. Both she and Dean stepped up to help, way far and beyond what I could have ever hoped. I was again treated like a family friend. And nothing beats integrity and trust in the people you deal with. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

Sweet, thoughtful gifts waiting for us, and a fresh baked loaf of bread brought to our door! Just amazing, above and beyond care!

Stayed a few nights","Angela and Dean exceeded all expectations! An extremely comfy bed with luxurious linens and lots of extra pillows. They had bottles of water, snacks and also a
Welcome gift for us! So many areas within the space to take in the beautiful views and we enjoyed walking around the property and looking at your chickens! We were surprised those roosters didn’t wake us up at the crack of dawn! The bathroom has a footed tub and there was plenty of hot water to fill it up and relax. So many fluffy towels too. Sorry, Angela, I probably used more than I needed! The fresh eggs and freshly baked bread were an added bonus, so delicious! Thank you for an incredible stay, we felt right at home!"

Stayed a few nights","I've travelled internationally and domestically and stayed in many different kinds of accommodation along the way...from camping in tents to 5-star hotel suites. Renting from Angela and Dean was, by far, one of the best I've ever had for a BnB. I was not treated like a guest, but more like a family friend. The rooms were beautifully appointed and super, super clean. Anything I needed as a traveler (coffee creamers, a desk to read at, a wonderful bathtub, more) was ready and available. The owners take great pride in their home, and it shows; the gardens and exterior are rural and serene; the beds and interior areas are designed with relaxation and comfort in mind. The location is a quick drive to Harrison or Branson, and beautiful scenery abounds. This is great rental for the couple needing some alone time, or 2-3 friends for a weekend, or the single traveler just needing to wind down and decompress. *This is how it's done, friends, and I highly, absolutely, recommend this place*"

Stayed one night","The most winsome aspect of this stay for me was not the idyllic sunrise views, the peace that permeated the home and property, or the well-thought-out amenities. It was Angela's passion for hospitality that struck me immediately upon arrival. As a single female traveller I choose my stays very carefully, and I ended up having to arrive after dark my first night. Angela sat up with a cup of tea to wait for me and make sure I felt welcome! Like coming home to family! And it did feel like coming home - I felt like I could truly rest here. The next morning I met Angela out in the garden and learned that she had originally used the space as her own creative escape, which explains the whole aura of the place. The space is like her - warm, gentle, joyful, thoughtful, and deeply grounded. But most of all, Angela's passion for caring for whole people and spirit of hospitality made this stay not just comfortable, but meaningful. I will surely be returning when I need rest, and to see a friend."

I look forward to going back for another romantic getaway with my handsome husband!"

Stayed a few nights","I will try to put into words the experience I just had at this beautiful place. I was on my first solo trip, so when I was greeted from the moment I pulled in, I immediately felt safe and at home. The Rooftop Garden was so much more than I expected. Beautiful, peaceful, relaxing. Angela and Dean were so kind and helpful in every way. I had everything I needed and more. There were so many pleasant surprises! I wanted to learn about canning and their way of living, so Angela took the time to show me and answer all of my questions. Coming here was the best decision I could've made. This was by far my best Airbnb experience, and I will be coming back for sure!!"

Stayed a few nights",We have stayed at alot of AirBnBs... this is one of the best. We went to this area to go floating and needed a place to stay near Harrison. This was so much more than a place to stay- it's more of a destination. It is located off the grid (but still had phone service and wifi). The closest restaurants and groceries are about 10 min away in Harrison. There is a Dollar General and Subway close 😉. Angela and Dennis are wonderful hosts. They spent time showing us the canning kitchen and soap making process but also would have left us alone if we preferred. They added so many extra special touches- I don't want to share because they were cool surprises. There are no suggestions I would make- it was truly an experience. They have everything you could possibly need- including fresh eggs. The beds are so comfortable with every type of pillow to choose from!

It's such a relaxing stay and feels like a home away from home. it was snowing so we didn't make use of the balcony but I opened up all the windows and felt the 360° winter wonderland all around. The artificial fireplace heater made it so much more enjoyable, not to mention their hospitality and keeping the property safe sweeping the snow and ice. We can't thank them enough!"

It's a custom made, custom designed studio with beautiful decor and fully furnished rooms. Bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom has every appliance and commodity fully stocked. location is everything as the balconies hang over the beautiful property grounds and every window has a view. from the front balcony coffee in the morning to the patio love seat under the stars at night, this is such a romantic stay in such a beautiful location. you don't need to travel to another country to experience a European studio in a green town, it's right here!"

Stayed a few nights","“A journey is best measured in friends, rather than miles.” Tim Cahill's quote about the people you meet is always more memorable than checking things off a bucket list. Angela and Dean are two amazing hosts with a beautiful property. We received a very warm welcome. It was very clear that Angela and Dean are very passionate about hosting their guests :) There were a lot of personal touches that made us feel like we were visiting family.
Calling this a studio apartment does not do it justice. This is a very spacious unit with its own well equipped kitchen. The terrace is beautifully furnished and is a nice place to hang out with a bottle of wine in the evening, or a cup of coffee in the morning.
The WiFi is strong with fast internet. The place was also spotless!
Come and experience the view and the hospitality. It's like a home away from home!
Bottom line, this does not feel like an AirBnB property - our experience was like we visited family and were pampered throughout our stay! Thank You Angela and Dean! We sure will come back again!"

They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay, plus some. The property is GORGEOUS. The two balconies that come with the stay are so cozy. We sat out there before the sun came up and watched a momma deer and her two babies. So cute! The house itself is beautiful and so peaceful. If you’re looking for a clean, quiet, cozy getaway, this is it. The farm fresh eggs and veggies from their gardens were such an awesome touch to breakfast and dinner that we cooked. Angela also left a thank you bag with her own homemade soaps that smell SO good. I can’t say enough how much we enjoyed this experience, and just how welcoming the hosts were. I would recommend this stay to anyone looking for a quiet getaway."

Stayed with kids","I loved the idea of an old farmhouse reimagined with a modern use in mind. I was here for my grandson’s wedding and my family got to spend a lot of time together. I baked the wedding cakes in the house and we had a great time sharing this time together. The outside of the house was modest and didn’t hint at the luxury of the interior. I guess this is silly, but I appreciated the massage chair the most after spending hours on my feet and working hard. Thank you, Leanne! My family enjoyed our stay so much!"

Stayed with kids","Dirty dishes put away. Not enough coffee mugs for amount of guests it was supposed to occupy. Towels smelled like mildew. (Previous guests?) left stuff in fridge when clearly states remove all. Some beds only had sheets & light top blanket no comforters for guests. Multiple dead & alive brown recluse spiders in front bathroom. Back deck was dirty (cushions more mildew like). French doors in front bedroom had Velcro/taped curtains that were falling down therefore no privacy for them The master bedroom downstairs was missing a drapery panel, therefore absolutely no privacy from the neighbors… We had to try to rig some thing up to be able to cover the foot wide gap. Going upstairs there is a small window that has a latch on it that can be easily opened by little kids with no screen no hardware that was child proof. To get to back deck you needed to go outside around the house and up the stairs or through the master due to other door, having issues with really old lock. Game area SMALL!"

Two of the bedrooms are connected by a bathroom (master and queen bedroom). The 3rd bedroom is queen and has its own bath with access from the hallway. The two bedrooms upstairs share a bath (bunk room and large king bedroom). It was the perfect layout. The house had beautiful decks and close walking distance to the park and splash pad.
The kitchen was stocked with essentials like plates, bowls, cups, cutlery, and cookware. The bathrooms were clean and stocked with towels. We will definitely be staying here again when visiting family in Harrison.
We were able to meet Libby when she stopped by to take the trash and out. Kind people!"

Sitting on the porch after a day of riding was very relaxing and enjoyable. All in our group felt the house was unique and interesting. The beds were comfortable and fit our needs. The only down side was the traffic noise on the busy AR 7 out front. I personally wear earplugs every night normally so I wasn’t bothered at night.
There was plenty of space to park our motorcycles and vehicles. I would highly recommend The Capps House to anyone wanting to enjoy the area around Harrison and surrounding locations."

More than ample hard surface parking for our 6 motorcycles and auto with easy ins and outs. The living room and, especially, the Music room, as we called it, were very comfortable spaces to sit and visit or relax. The dining room comfortably sat all 8 of us. But the thing that made this place so special is its location on Pine St., which is also highway AR 7. Taking 7 south and north gave us access to more than 15 different MC day trip routes, with countless possible variations. The host was very friendly, flexible and easy to work with. We also met the caretaker, who was also very friendly and helpful."

The bathrooms are stocked with all the essentials, the water is hot and plentiful and the claw foot tubs invite you to draw a bath and let your troubles slip away. Games are provided for all ages and there are no shortage of tvs for those that want to stay plugged in. When you finally turn in, you will not be disappointed in the mattress quality. It does not disappoint. The house is right on the main highway but is very quiet. You just can’t go wrong booking this place."

He was very responsive and accommodating to our check in/ out needs. The house was fully stocked with kitchen tools/appliances and basic needs. The area was very peaceful and there was a lot of backyard space.
There was a dart board and trivia cards available to use, and a small table which we were able to use for a puzzle.
The workspace in one of the bedrooms was perfect, as I was working remotely, and there were 2 extra monitors for use.
I plan on visiting the area more and hope to book with Michael in the future."

Her home was welcoming, quiet & peaceful! Everything was clean & the house smelled wonderfully…no air fresheners were too strong or overpowering. Great water pressure in the shower! Super comfy blanket for the bed.

It was so wonderful and relieved so much stress to know we had a place to stay that was going to be clean, quiet and comfortable. Rhonda left us to most delicious apple friendship bread. When we checked out I realized my wallet was missing and had to ask Rhonda to check the place for it. She turned over everything looking for it. And was so helpful."

Bent and Dent is about a mile from the house and has delicious baked goods and a deli counter as well as groceries We spent the week visiting with friends, that are like family , fishing (and catching rainbow trout) on the White River, exploring the Buffalo River's waterfalls, shopping at Osage Pottery, and chasing air balloons from Harrison's 25th annual event.

Every single detail, and there are a lot of them both inside and out, is beautiful. The host is welcoming, and even brought me delicious scones, which I had for breakfast the next day. Also, when I had questions, responses came quickly.
Getting here is easy. Once you arrive at the property, you may be overwhelmed with the vastness of the land, and the fact that there are 3 houses, as well as additional little buildings. All I did was pause in the driveway to read my instructions again, and I instantly knew where to go. In fact, I had food delivered, because I didn’t want to leave. I simply copy/pasted the same instructions that were provided to me, and the driver found me.
If you need some R&R, I can’t recommend this cottage enough!"

The decorations were really neat. The waterfall and pond were beautiful. I enjoyed seeing the chickens in the chicken house.

Every detail and decoration makes this cottage special. We enjoyed scrambling farm fresh eggs for breakfast on the copper countertop while looking through the kitchen window overlooking the cows grazing in the meadow. Patty had homemade scones for us on arrival that were absolutely delicious!! Peace, privacy, and serenity abounded as we would enjoys meals by the waterfall or as we would stroll through the garden or relax on the porch swing.

Beautiful scenery, quiet, peaceful, cows, cats, chickens (fresh eggs). Great host. Cottage was clean and had everything we needed. Cooked breakfast and dinner each night. The sound of the waterfall into the fish and frog pond was a wonderful addition to the cows mooing. Bed was comfortable and plenty of extra quilts. Bathroom was clean and great water pressure.

We discovered orange-cranberry scones awaiting us in the kitchen. The surrounding area was meticulously landscaped, with a waterfall, fountains, sculptures, gardens, stone walls and a fire pit. Just magical. Beyond the lawn, pastures filled with cows, horses, and mules added to the beauty of this country retreat. I cannot recommend this cottage highly enough."

We arrived in the evening,we could see this property lit up so magical. Every detail was put in place with perfection and a touch of love. Our host were so kind❤️ We truly felt such peace and relaxation as soon as we stepped our feet into our cottage. Welcomed with fresh baked muffins. Delicious~We saw and experienced walks through the flower and vegetable gardens that were so beautiful! We woke up and had coffee on the front porch swing~I truly felt so close to God. We sat out back looking over these rolling hills,and watched the sunset. All around us is the most beautiful landscaping and waters fall and fish pond. For us it was an experience, because we believed everything had a meaning. We truly had a spiritual and emotional ~romantic time. Christine and Patty have left nothing out! Over the top 5 star experience. We will be back."

Those are the three best words to describe our reaction to this unbelievable cottage! We've rented countless properties for weekend getaways, but we've never experienced one that even comes close to this. We read the reviews, saw the photographs and even had feedback from previous guests prior to coming. However, none of that information sufficiently prepares you for arriving and seeing it for yourself. The gorgeous ridge top setting in the quiet countryside, the immaculate grounds full of surprises at every turn, the unique interior of the cottage that encourages relaxation - all of it combines to create a sense of discovery, delight and peace. We are so grateful for the opportunity to stay here and hope we'll be able to return often."

Stayed about a week","Hey Christine. Thank you for sharing your Mom’s Guest House with us. We enjoyed it greatly.
I do have a couple recommendations. One… we found one plastic large cup but think the place could use 2 or so for tea and such. We used the lil ones till I found the one. We had to keep refilling them. Two… the small coffee creamers were curdled. Either let the guest know to get creamer for their 1st morning coffee or provide powder or leave the creamers in the fridge. Maybe it’ll last longer. (?)
Regardless, we thought the place was perfect and will recommend it to anyone coming in your area or when we need to return.
Take care - Heather and David"

The only thing I would comment on was the gas fireplace didn’t work, which I was really looking forward to using because it was a cool rainy day when we arrived. Also the air conditioning could use a little tweaking, it was noisy the whole time.
But those things weren’t enough for me to not give it a 5 star rating and I’ve already recommended it to two friends. Wonderful place ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Really a unique experience if you’re looking for something like that in an Airbnb stay! We used it as a place to celebrate our anniversary and drive to a few hiking spots (Lost Valley and Whitaker Point aka Hawksbill Crag).
If don’t mind being on a working farm and able to watch the cows or chickens you can do that here. If you want to stay in your own private cottage with full kitchen and king size bed? Check. If you enjoy grilling outdoors with an evening fire next to the pond with waterfall feature? It has that too. Or you can simply stroll around the English style garden and check out the water feature there and the multiple trellises and whatever they have planted.
Fortunately the weather was nice enough for us in early March to enjoy outside, but this place will be even more spectacular to view when spring fully arrives as nothing was really in bloom or growing yet when we were there.
Location was great and easy to find and just a few miles from downtown Harrison where we enjoyed Neighbor’s Mill for lunch one day and Devito’s for dinner one evening."

Mrs Patty's garden and fire pit were wondeful places to spend some time and her thoughtful touches were great. I also loved seeing her artwork in the cottage. It is close to town and less than an hour from Branson. The view is beautiful. Mrs. Patty's home and their other airbnb, a beautiful carriage house, is all in the same area but other than waving at the neighbors or seeing them in the garden, it was reasonably private most the time. The fire pit was our favorite place with the sound of the water close and the fire crackling getting to watch the sunset. Would love to come back."

The views were absolutely beautiful, the cottage was absolutely breathe taking with all the thought put into the decorations, and the land that the cottage is actually on from the Koi pond, to the fire pit (much used), and the horticulture it was just the perfect weekend to just get away for the Wife and I thank you so much."

The cottage has soaring ceiling, wonderful views, all the amenities you need (little fridge, oven, stove, kitchen things, hairdryer, makeup mirror, etc.) plus the use of the fire pit and grill out back which are situated next to a spectacular water feature with waterfalls, rock pools and a koi filled pond. Additionally, the owner greeted us with chocolate chips scones upon check in and said we could walk through her English potager garden. We have many lovely pictures from our three night stay and were able to really relax around the water feature during the day and fire pit in the evenings."

As I began the review process, I was asked if this place met, somewhat exceeded, or exceeded our expectations. To be honest, and based on the reviews, I expected this cottage to be wonderful...and it was...even better than we expected!
Awesome location just outside Harrison! Quiet, great views, open fields, and beautiful sunsets. Unique decor, thoughtful touches throughout the cottage, and spotless!
Outside the cottage is a fish-filled pond, a comfy hammock for relaxation, and seating around a stone fire pit. Wood provided - really couldn't have asked for more.
This place was as close to perfect as one could get! A must stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The kitchen stocking goes above and beyond, I have never seen a kitchen as well stocked in any air bnb. This home is catered for dogs, not children! There are multiple steps to getting the house unlocked, and the front steps are so steep I could not walk up them carrying a child or luggage, and the entrance to the back gate is very narrow because it doesn’t open fully and we couldn’t fit our big luggage through it. There are a lot of cameras, the inside camera is connected to the security system, and we were told we could cover it and did so. However the cameras outside stay on, and one is pointed directly at the hot tub. My husband and I did not use the hot tub because of that, but our older kids did and it was hot and clean. Cleanliness, towels, dishes, laundry facilities, those were all wonderful!"

After long days of exploring, we loved going back to Sandy's place to relax, grab a bite to eat, catch up on some of our TV shows, and relax on the front porch or in the backyard with a cup of coffee! This house is decorated perfectly in my opinion and she has everything you need available and more! Some of the amenities were chocolates, cookies, snacks, waters in the fridge, coffee, creamer, etc. Sandy even bought us a bottle of wine for our 24th anniversary and had a card on the table for us! Basically, you could bring your clothes and toiletries and probably be fine and not want for anything else that she hasn't already supplied. She has put a lot of thought into providing everything you need to make you feel like you are in your own home. We definitely did! Check in was fast and easy and Sandy was always quick to communicate."

We love to cook as many meals as we can, and the kitchen was stocked with so much, even spices and snacks for the family. Having options of a soft or firm bed helped because after a couple nights we swapped to the firmer (apparently I’m getting older and my back is picky with beds). The kids enjoyed multi tvs, we ALL enjoyed the puzzles and the story behind them, and the backyard was welcoming and charming. The birds also loved the front yard! I wanted to go to the market but due to weather it was canceled. We reached out for tips on public computers and was pleased the library was so close. The info provided to us made our stay so efficient. We even utilized the vet while there for a cut our lab had and they were wonderful to fit us in. Would absolutely book again if we are in north AR."

Stayed one night","This was a great, affordable option for us to spend the night in Harrison. The decor is very cool and eclectic - really fun to look at the antiques. Feels like going to your grandmas house lol. Communication was great and the place is easy to find and exactly as pictured. Beds were clean and comfy. Only thing to note is that the bedrooms don’t cool off as well as the main area where the window ac unit is, but we were comfortable with the tabletop fan provided in the bedroom we stayed in."

I loved the antique cabin vibe. The simple touches like the night light lamps, extra fans, plenty of towels and blankets were very much appreciated. We didn't use the kitchen much but, it had everything one would need when cooking is necessary. If we ever need to be back, I will definitely book again. I was sad we had to leave early to a game because the bed was that comfortable! My 17 yro son says the rental deserves a 10! Thank you again!"

Super clean and comfortable beds. Tons of extra linens if needed. Quiet neighborhood. As per the description the ceiling is on the low side especially in the bathroom but luckily this was not an issue for my family. If you are on the tall side you may want to take this into consideration. Great covered parking just a couple of steps from the entrance. Would definitely stay again!

They also had to be drug out of the creek when it was time to check out. During the course of our stay they asked about 10 times if we could move there. This is the cutest little home that is nice and clean, that is private with a long driveway, and is perfect for the nature loving families. It’s the simple things in life, and this house reminded me of that. Give the kids a creek and some cool bunk beds and we’re good. 🤷🏽‍♀️😄"

It is the perfect spot to kick back on the covered porch and relax as you listen to the Cicadas signing, the creek bubbling, and watch the cows grazing! We spent most mornings slowly eating breakfast on the porch, sitting there way longer than planned, soaking in the serenity of the surroundings. We spent many evenings doing the same thing and then taking a nice walk on the long driveway. We would highly recommend anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of this world to rent this place. Sarah was great to deal with and was super responsive to any questions we had. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We truly enjoyed our stay! It was a wonderful spot to spend our vacation."

I was glad to share some pictures of the place. It's a ""tiny house"", just as expected, but it has an upscale yet simple feel about it that I found very likable.
There were no surprises other than just how nice the house is and how perfectly it matched the pictures and exceeded expectations. Easy to get in, no complicated instructions. I stayed 3 nights and checking out was simple. I will definitely check here first for a return trip. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend Amy and the tiny house. I forgot to sign the guest book. I'll do it next time. Thank you!"

One note- we arrived at night time so we had a bit a trouble finding the entrance. There are two steep driveways next to each other. The left one is the one we should’ve gone up. We figured that out after we drove up the one on the right. Just a heads up for any future guests."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed staying in this cute little Airbnb overall. We were a bit disappointed when we arrived and saw that it wasn’t very private. The listing makes it appear as if it’s in the woods in a secluded area but it faces another house across the driveway. We booked it hoping to have a private getaway for our anniversary but didn’t end up using the balcony/porch as there were people across the street pretty much the whole time (the balcony and deck face the other houses). For the price, we were a little bummed that the listing didn’t meet expectations. However, it felt very clean & cute and the location was easy to find/super close to town. The host was easy to get in touch with and very helpful!
Also it’s worth mentioning the driveway is pretty steep and rocky! We managed to get up, but other cars might have trouble."

Stayed a few nights",We recommend this tiny home for those wanting to spend some time with nature and yet want some time in Branson. We had a wonderful time visiting the scenic views in the area. Amy was a gracious host and the tiny home had everything you need for that get away.

Stayed a few nights","I had the most lovely stay at this tiny home! I booked this the morning of my solo road trip for a few days. Amy was very responsive, kind, and accommodating the entire stay. This was the perfect balance between nature-getaway while still being close to town and having quick access to anything I needed. Went hiking on the Centerpoint to Goat Trail about a 30 minute drive from the house--would definitely recommend! Only thing I would point out is that the driveway off the main road is pretty steep. Should be no problem on a larger car, but just have to go pretty slow in a lower car. Nothing that should deter you from staying here! This is a lovely home, with a lovely host, and would 10/10 want to stay here again."

I had some of the best nights sleep I’ve had in a while. I also loved that there were a couple different types of pillows to choose from. The sound machine was the cherry on top. Close enough to town to run quick errands, if needed, but far enough to still feel some seclusion. Great stay. Did not disappoint."

Stayed about a week","My husband and I absolutely loved this tiny home! As soon as we walked in I was pleasantly surprised at how open and spacious it felt. The large windows, tall ceilings and soft grey walls really helped tiny feel big. I would stay here time and time again! Take advantage of the deck upstairs and the sitting area on the front porch.
There is plenty of fridge space AND a dishwasher! I mean idk how they fit all of the amenities in this small space without it feeling crowded, BUT THEY DID! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The stairs are a bit steep, but there are rails to hold on to. As long as you’re careful you should have no problem at all.
If you are a light sleeper, there is a white noise speaker that you can use. We used it just because we like the sound of rain 🌧.
My husband and I have stayed at many Airbnbs because of our job. Amy and her husband are the best hosts we’ve ever had! They are easy to communicate with and are ready to help if you have any problems.

My only suggestion is be careful when taking the road to the driveway, it’s very short but was fairly washed out when we went, so low riding cars take caution. But other than that small detail, it was an excellent stay."

The stairs are not for the faint hearted, if you have to go to the bathroom a lot during the night. but the upstairs had a high ceiling, so my 6‘3“ husband did not have any problems. I was amazed at all the amenities that were provided in such a tiny place, and it is evident that Amy has thought of everything to make someone’s stay absolutely wonderful. We would definitely come back and definitely recommend."

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon trip. We absolutely loved it. Not far from town but out in the peaceful country. The creek running right out from the porch was beautiful and peaceful, just what we were looking for. We were met with fresh delicious hot out of the oven muffins, idk if it was because they knew it was our honeymoon or if that's something they just do but we felt very grateful and blessed. The cabin was so charming and comfortable, from the amazing, most comfortable rocking chair I've ever sat in, to an amazing night sleep in a VERY comfortable bed. You can bring your own food to cook in the precious little fully stocked kitchen with anything you may need to cook and an out door grill. The fire pit was lovely with firewood stacked next to it ready for us to enjoy beside the creek. We highly recommend staying here! They had snacks on the table including gluten free options wich was lovely since I myself eat gluten free. The wildlife were cute"

Stayed with kids","Everything was amazing and the beds where very comfortable. I really did enjoy my stay compared to a motel or hotel.
However not to the owners fault but I found it to be too perfumy with the carpet cleaner. So the first couple of days I had a headache. I personally don't like the arm-in-hammer carpet cleaner and others like it, a lot of them have toxic chemicals in them. So I recommend you ask the owner to air out the place before you stay if your sensitive to chemicals like I am.
Still the place is in a great location and you can walk to the food store which is a 5 minute walk and it was close to where I was visiting my sister. I highly recommend your stay there if you have family near by.
Thank you for the wonderful stay

Stayed with kids","The house is a gem. A lot of work and care has clearly been put into it, and it truly feels like home. Full-size appliances, comfortable beds, beautiful bathrooms (2 of them! And with delightful water pressure in the showers!), and plenty of space to spread out on 2 floors made this a really pleasant place to stay. The large porch with swings and hammocks added to the living space and was also very convenient for setting out towels, water shoes, etc, if you’ve spent a day on the Buffalo River. The house is set back off a quiet street, and sharing the property with the hosts was totally fine and didn’t not feel like our families were in each other’s way—hopefully they felt the same way! The location was convenient to the Buffalo River area, as well as Branson, and the town of Harrison was equally nice to explore—local restaurants, murals in the downtown area, as well as a fun park just across the creek with multiple play structures and splash pad. The hosts were helpful and friendly, and it’s clear they take pride in the home and their town. Overall, the comfort, amenities, affordability and location made this perfect for our family. We would highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed this property. It was very clean, bed comfortable and we could tell there was a great deal of thought put into the decorating.
One thing we didn’t realize was how close it was to the owners house. Both properties share a deck. Although we didn’t see anyone, it would of been nice to of had a privacy fence between.
You have no backyard, and a tiny bit of yard between the house and parking.
It was nice to have off street parking available.
Overall, great space."

The house is very close to the countryside highway so convenient for driving to restaurants, hikes, etc. (while also not loud). We arrived late at night and had no problem getting in with the lockbox. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","We had such a wonderful stay in this adorable rustic cabin. There are SO many things to do nearby. Shelly has a welcome book full of tons of advice on things to do, places to see, spots to eat. You can tell this host took the time to make sure you feel at home with many personal touches. The home was very clean and decorated nicely. We enjoyed the comfortable bed and the cozy cabin feel.
We wish we had more time as we only stayed one night. We were able to explore downtown Branson and eat on the water and the next day explore Big Cedar, which did not disappoint. We hope to return in the near future and stay in this delightful cabin again!"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely cabin just off Hwy 65, very convenient to Harrison and Big Cedar/Branson/Table Rock without being in the big middle of it all.
Cabin was very comfy for 2, very clean and the decor was spot on without being too much.
Upstairs sleeping loft had its own AC unit and fan so we got the perfect sleeping temperature. The queen size bed was very plush and comfortable. It was a little high and there are steps to help you climb up that slide back underneath the bed and out of the way.
Kitchen is small with plenty of dishes, pots and skillets and baking sheets, and a cutting board. There is plates and silverware for 4. Coffee maker was full size with coffee, filters, powdered creamer and sugar packets.
Best part for us was the front porch! There was a table and 2 chairs and we ate all our meals outside and enjoyed our morning coffee and evening cocktails there as well
Shelly’s recommended restaurants were spot on as well
Overall a great cabin, book this and enjoy your stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This location was super central and Alyssa was super timely with any questions we had. The cottage was clean and tidy and had everything we needed.
Check in with code was super simple.
We loved the simple decor and encouraging quotes and Bible verses. We came to see family with my 86 and 87 yo parents. Alyssa was gracious to allow them to come to us to make it easier on my parents. It worked out perfectly! Our family is super large and there has been some brokenness and hurt with many of them. It was great to be here to watch some of the relationships be restored. The verses round the house were really the testimony of the wk so this little cottage is super special. My 26 yo nephew said Auntie this is a special house- he was restored to his birth dad here.. too many details to share but thank you!
If we come back, would rent this one again!!"

Stayed with kids",Alyssia is always extremely quick to respond. She has excellent communication with her guests. If there is any issue (i always have problems with key pads lol) she is extremely quick to come fix it. She was very flexible with me and so nice to talk with. I absolutely enjoyed my stay at her home that was immaculately clean and had everything we needed and then some. 10 out of 10. Alyssia is such an amazing host!

It had all the comforts of home which we were very thankful for. We did need to get a hold of Alyssia, and she responded quickly and was very friendly and helpful. I would 100% recommend the White Oak Cottage! It was very clean, and had everything we needed. The check in process was a breeze too. Thank you!"

Alyssia was so accommodating & we even had to extend our stay!
One of the “absolute cleanest places I’ve ever stayed in!!”

Stayed a few nights","The place is as advertised. No more, and no less. I would say it was cozy, but good bang for the buck. I was just looking for a place to sleep, shower, and park my truck and motorcycle trailer and it did all of these things just fine. It is right down the street from a nice convenient store, perfect for fueling up the bike and getting coffee.
The kitchen was well equipped. Everything in the place looked to be fairly new and spotlessly clean"

Stayed a few nights",I had traveled to Harrison for a family emergency; I typically plan a head but took a chance to book an AirBnb for the same day. Charity was quick to respond and accommodate my short notice request. The place was better than the pictures. I immediately felt at home; it was great to stay at a place that was quiet and relaxing. Better than a hotel. I would highly recommend considering Charity’s place for your trip to Harrison!
