Stayed a few nights","It was the perfect location right in the heart of downtown Spencer and right above the amazing Medlar Coffee Company and Poiema Design...right around the corner from Pressed and several other wonderful small town shops that were delightful. The Medlar was so cozy and clean, felt like home. And the fragrance in the stairwell was amazing and said ""come, stay awhile, you are most welcome!"" Way to go Michael and team!"

Stayed with kids","Great place! Went to visit family. This downtown is for sure a summer spot and we stayed for the holidays so it was very quiet which was ok.
Upon check in the code didn’t work but the host responded within 5 minutes and no problem getting in.
Very clean and organized. Pullout is more like a futon but that was ok too. Easy to figure out.
Coffee shop below closes around 2 (Saturdays) so the first day we were unable to go in since check in is 4:00 and closed Sunday so we didn’t get to enjoy that. Could have easily looked that up myself so not complaining just good to know.
Small town but 5 minute to restaurants and shopping.
Thanks for the nice stay!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful apartment. Fully renovated and decorated with amazing decor. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in an airbnb. Even the pull out coach my husband loved was comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed in order to make breakfast for my family and I. You can tell the put in a lot of time and love in the home.
My only complaint would be not having a working bath stopper available to bath my two little ones. We used a cup to help stop some of the water from draining but had too keep water running while bathing our kids so the water wouldn’t run completely out while bathing them.
The coffee shop was hands down the best coffee I ever had. My kids loved the muffins. Would come back again for our next family vacation!"

Stayed with kids","The ideal location for a trip to Spencer, IA! Walking distance to several restaurants in town, a brewery, the Spencer Public Library, great parks. Not to mention the best boutique coffee shop in town is literally downstairs (The Medlar Coffee Co.) Beautiful building with a lovely walk up. The apartment itself is tastefully decorated with all the simple touches of home. It’s a smaller space that’s very thoughtfully laid out with its placement of furniture to feel perfectly spacious and homey. Hosts are very kind and accommodating. We had no issues and will definitely look to stay again in the future! 10/10 recommend."

Stayed about a week","The apartment is super cute. It is decorated beautifully and served the purpose we needed it to. We did not utilize the whole kitchen but the option was nice and there were adequate dishes to do so if needed. Bathroom is located inside the bedroom so be aware if traveling with non family. Also the 2nd bed is a fold open cushion couch not a pull out. Also if laundry is on your must have, grab some coins as it is coin operated in the basement. You will need to let the host know you need access, but they very quickly gave us needed codes to allow access. The host was quick to respond anytime we had a question during our 9 night stay. Air conditioning is window and keep in mind it is an old building."

Stayed a few nights","I could not be more pleased with my accommodations in Spencer, Iowa. Heather provided a comfortable one bedroom apartment with everything I could possibly need. The location is outstanding in walking distance to the supermarket, fair grounds, hospital and the entire downtown.
The building itself is called the Medlar Studio which is art deco style with a tiled facade. It is beautiful and I surmise was built around the 1920s. If you visit Toads coffee shop around the corner he will tell you the story of the fire that destroyed most of the downtown with the exception of the Medlar building, which survived the fire.
Spencer itself is a really comfortable town full of nice people. Its worth a stay!"

This apartment is beautiful and had everything I needed. What a gift to stay in such a beautifully restored piece of history! So many incredible special touches with the furniture and design! just gorgeous! If you are anywhere in the area I recommend staying here. it is very centrally located in Spencer and very close to restaurants and shopping because it is right downtown in a historic building. If you need to drive anywhere in the area like I did, the countryside is gorgeous. Beautiful old farmhouses, red barns, and lush green fields. I highly recommend this spot!"

Stayed a few nights","Growing up staying in my grandparents 1900’s bungalow as well as owning a 1908 bungalow for many years, we felt right at home 🏡. We stayed in the two main floor bedrooms and both had comfortable beds. Larger bathroom which was pleasantly surprising for an old home! The charm and personality of an older home is present: woodwork, squeaky floors, many cupboards in the kitchen, etc. One should feel right at home because of the hospitality and ease of use. Very clean - we have a family member with asthma due to dust allergies and they had zero episodes while we stayed. Thank you to Barry and Rhonda for their communication prior, during and after our stay. We would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","We were there for a wedding so didn't spend much time in the home but we enjoyed coming ""home"" in the evenings, sit in a comfy family room, and watch a movie. The beds were very comfortable and warm. The little Christmas tree was a nice touch and served as a fun night-light for the grand kids. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful with everything covered in snow. We were surprised to see that someone had come by and shoveled the front porch, steps, and walkways for us...very thoughtful. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely choose to stay again."

We even got some Christmas baking done together which was great fun! The house is so comfortable and homey. The kitchen was great for baking together. It is located close to downtown which is convenient. We will definitely recommend staying here!

Marie provided a lovely muffin and fruit , tea/coffee breakfast and encouraged me to take it to their beautiful screened in porch that looks out over a river and a beautiful green meadow. I was able to record the sounds and songs of well over a dozen different birds from the porch.
I certainly recommend them to anyone needing a really nice place to stay when they are in this area. I would stay with them again if I’m anywhere close. It felt like “home”❣️They were very eager to provide anything that I needed during my stay.
THANK YOU, Marie and John"

Several cars were there for the Bible Study, but my parking spot was reserved! Both Marie and John are excellent conversationalists, and Marie and I talked to the wee hours Monday evening.

The dining room / living room is spacious with relaxing views of the golf course beyond the patio where we also spent plenty of evenings relaxing and talking to the friendly neighbors. The two bedrooms are large and comfortable as well. We will definitely be back if we are able.

There were 4 of us, but the host provided a bunch of other sleeping options like 4 bedrolls and extra pillows. The upstairs bedroom is huge and so cute. Plenty of outlets for charging, etc. The kitchen is well stocked with things needed including coffee filters. The air conditioning was GREAT!

Stayed with kids","This was our first experience with any Airbnb, so it was a heavy learning curve. We learned the importance of reading the description very carefully and important questions to ask for future trips. Having said that, Cindy was an amazing host, going above and beyond. She was super fast in responding to any questions or needs. It is a very lovely home and for travelers without small children, would be ideal. We have 2 toddlers, so I would highly not recommend this stay for others in that situation. There is a staircase leading from the sleeping area to the main level that a gate could not fit at the top or bottom. There’s also no enclosed room except the bathroom, so getting kids to sleep and having any privacy was quite difficult. The location was great, we frequented Spencer as well as okoboji so it really is a great middle spot."

The hosts were lovely and I especially appreciated how pet friendly the place was — it’s often difficult to find Airbnbs with reasonable pet policies so this one was truly a blessing!
Highly recommended, especially for pet owners like myself!"

Couple things to consider: you can hear every step the owners take from the level above you. I wish I could post a video of how loud the creeks are. Also we were instructed to use the patio door entrance to enter our space, which is down uneven/steep steps down the hill- not great for kids."

The rental was even better than advertised, as it included an activity room with toys, games, and pool table to keep the kids busy. The beautiful surroundings at the property were also an added bonus and made for a peaceful setting for morning coffee. The location is a nice middle point to head to either Spirit Lake or Okoboji for activities or dining. As is typical with multi-level, owner-occupied listings there is some floor noise from the level above, but it is minor compared to all the benefits of this rental. My family would definitely visit again for a future stay."

Everything was clean, and they had plenty of extras like shampoo and laundry detergent. I’ve stayed in many places, and the beds, sheets and blankets were extra nice. It can be a little noisy, but it is a basement apartment, so that is to be expected. We are excited to return next year. ❤️"

I feel like it should be mentioned or called semi private since you can’t lock the sliding barn door to the house or any bedroom doors, this could bother some people. You can hear noises from upstairs but not much more then living in an apt. Also the outside steps could be an issue with some folks, big steps, we preferred them to going into the main house though. I would like to come back when it’s warm enough to enjoy the deck that is being refurbished. Thank you!"

We enjoyed the sweet dog that greeted us and trotted around outside when we walked around. She made us feel safe, too! Host introduced himself in the AM, very kind. The home was cozy and you can tell they put their hearts into it. The bread was such a nice gesture, and it really hit the spot for a late night snack with some butter, which they also provided, already sitting out to spread easy :) We were very comfortable and very pleased! Very peaceful vibe. We did struggle to figure out Wi-Fi, and our Internet didn’t work great out there. I couldn’t find a Wi-Fi password anywhere, checked my emails and correspondence with the hosts and the info just wasn’t anywhere, and it does list Wi-Fi. We wanted it for some music. It seemed too late to ask them, although I am sure they would have been more then willing to respond. We just did without, still enjoyed!!"

Our girls loved petting the horses and the friendly dog. The location is beyond beautiful and relaxing, and the bunkhouse is much bigger in person. There were plenty of sleeping spaces and the hosts went above and beyond with providing extra amenities.

The homemade bread was such a nice gesture; it was delicious, and especially when you toast it and put some butter on it. It's a great place for a family of 5 or 6. Love the horse painting and horse ornaments and decorations and there are interesting books about horses as well. The dog is very friendly. Liked visiting with the donkeys and the mini horses. The only thing we would have liked - if there would have been a bigger coffee maker, but it was not a deal breaker. We did use a neat electric kettle to heat up water and we were able to make tea or instant coffee with it. In all, we really had no issues and we really enjoyed our stay there. We highly recommend it. 👌😊"

When you're ready to rest, come back to the farm for a peaceful evening plus tons of things to keep the kiddos entertained. Dan and Karen were so welcoming and our little one LOVED feeding and getting to know the horses and resident dog. House was clean and well stocked."

We had many visits to the barn to see the horses. The donkey was hilarious as he vocalized a few times wanting visitors. The dog immediately grated us each time we exited the house. She was a great host herself. My children were very fond of her. The quarters we stayed in were perfect. Beds were comfy. Place was clean. My husband and I enjoyed epic ping pong games with many laughs. Very roomy and open area. I would definitely stay here again if in the area. They were most a accommodating. Communication was great.

This was a last minute Iowa lakes area vacation for us and the location was close enough to the lake to come back for nap time, but far enough away to avoid the lakes prices. We have two small children and between the playhouse in the old chicken coop, the swings and the trampoline, they were never left wanting more. Our 4 year old even got a pony ride in the morning before we left. We would definitely stay here again in the future!"

If you are doing a lot of cooking, you may want to bring some additional basics like spatula, ladle, frying pans. They have many basics but it’s not like cooking with your own items.
Make sure you have a plan for food when you arrive, because we found that restaurants didn’t deliver, so we were happy to have brought groceries with us.
There is a dog that greats you (super friendly). The Bunkhouse is quiet and out of the way. Our kids loved the in-ground trampoline.
The WiFi was excellent and we had no issues with connection or speed. Netflix was available through the Blu-ray player.
The beds were comfortable, there were toys the kids played with, and the animals were fun to look at.
Overall it was a great stay with great host. Our family had a blast and we would definitely stay here again."

The kids had an absolute blast on the trampoline, climbing on the playhouse, swinging on the swing set, and petting and feeding the miniature horses. Our kids were very excited for the chance to sleep in a bunk bed. We brought some food along in a cooler, for snacks and breakfast and ordered take out for dinner. It all went smoothly. The location is rural and perfect for a family getaway in a setting you may have never experienced before. We were greeted by the owners upon arrival and they were very friendly and happy and introduce us to the animals. There were amazing mini muffins waiting when we got inside. The kids devoured them. Thank you for a great trip."

Stayed one night","Dan and Karen have a lovely farm, not far off the beaten path. Their property is clean, beautifully landscaped and exactly what you'd hope to find in a small personal farm. The bunkhouse was spotless, warm and HUGE. We only had 3 people staying this trip but we could have definitely brought 10 more and had plenty of space for us all! The special touches throughout the bunkhouse were a delight. Freshly baked bread still hot from the oven, a full-sized kitchen with breakfast items at your disposal, lovely bathroom with all the amenities and space to get ready, a piano, ping-pong table and more in the living room to entertain. The list goes on and on. Definitely a lovely space and the value is outstanding."

Stayed with kids","Hands down the best Airbnb experience. Their home and property is like a dream and they added personal touches all throughout to make guests instantly feel at home and welcome. Even with mini horses and a donkey, their dog, Nala, stole the show as just about the best dog we've ever met. Trying to find the barn cats and kittens was a favorite past time of our toddler and we had to pry her from the chicken coop playhouse to take care of her basic needs throughout the day. We decided to extend by a day the minute we walked in and are planning our next trip ASAP. Thank you, Dan & Karen, for sharing your home and allowing us this charming experience!"

There were also fun things for the family to do inside and out. Ping pong, chalkboard, board games, animals, in ground trampoline, swing set, etc. Dan was also very accommodating and ensured we had everything we needed including grilling tools. It wasn't necessary to leave which so much to do on the farm but there was a small town with everything you needed within minutes. The stay was so, so great. Definitely recommend and will look to stay again for the next fun family vacation."

Our teens loved the piano, ping pong table, and in-ground trampoline, and our younger two loved the little playhouse, the outdoor play structure, and the trampoline (plus the assortment of toys inside). Everything was clean and lovely, and there were home baked muffins waiting for us upon arrival. The kids also loved feeding the horses and cats (and even the noisy donkey!)."

The bunk house was very spacious and clean.
We initially brought a lot of our own stuff only to realize that there are many amnesties in place already.. especially around the kitchen.
We had more space than we needed, and the kids really enjoyed the play house the animals.
We appreciated the home made bread and the extras.
The kids could play around on the trampoline , the swing set, the playhouse and most importantly we could gril every night around the fire pit.
Dan always made sure we had a good supply of wood each night for the fire pit.
The place is clean , quite , safe and very relaxing. Dan and Karen’s dog NALA , was always around and .
Thank you again for having us... we enjoyed every moment at the bunkhouse!

Stayed one night","We enjoyed a mini-family reunion here following our mom's 80th birthday party. This was the perfect place for us to gather, play games, and share a meal. There were 11 of us sharing the space for about six hours, with four from the group spending the night. (I never thought I would hear my 75-year old aunt claiming dibs on the top bunk!) The open area provided plenty of room for everyone to mingle; and we couldn't have asked for a better place for everyone to gather.
It only took about 10 minutes for someone to pick up the ping pong paddles and begin playing, with room for doubles. (Plenty of laughter was shared by all.) With other games to choose from, and the large chalkboard, we had endless opportunities to relax.
Daniel was very easy to work with and responded quickly to all of my requests. He met us at check in and made sure we had everything we needed. This property will remain on our short list as one we'd like to come back to the next time we're in the area. I've already recommended it to several friends who might be looking for a place near Lake Okoboji, or while visiting family in the Spencer area with the need for more room to spread out."

Daniel and Karen were very quick to respond to all messages and texts sent. They were also very accommodating when the number of people in our group kept changing. Loved the extra touches such as the homemade bread and the cereal and milk for breakfast.
The only downside is that the mattresses on the beds are a bit uncomfortable, especially the ones on the pullout couches. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you for letting us stay in your super fun bunkhouse!"

You are literally a block off of Highway 71 which in the lakes area takes you pretty much everywhere. Never stayed on Center Lake before but it's peaceful and nice to hear the waves come in at dawn. Master Bedroom shows the entire lake if you open the shades. Definitely stay here if you have a chance. It's worth it!

The minute i walked in i felt at home and it flooded me with memeories. It has an amazing sun room for morning coffee with great veiws of the water and a private backyard with stairs leading to the lake. Everything is in reach. Blankets,kitchen utensils, grill,kids toys,laundry and a sauna all right on site! You cant beat the price for these views, space, and quiet relaxing environment.

Stayed a few nights","Nestled in the heart of a picturesque lake town in Spirit Lake, Iowa, my recent Airbnb stay was a delightful blend of tranquility and small-town charm. As I approached the property, I was greeted by the serene backdrop of the shimmering lake, its surface mirroring the soft hues of the Iowa sky.
The Airbnb was a cozy haven, thoughtfully furnished to provide comfort and a sense of home. Each morning, I awoke to the gentle lull of the lake, its quiet presence a constant companion during my stay. The living area, comfortable seating, and warm lighting invited lazy afternoons with a good book or quiet contemplation.
Its seamless blend with the natural surroundings sets this place apart. The deck offered an uninterrupted view of the lake, making it the perfect spot for a morning coffee or an evening of stargazing."

The owner was able to save the original characteristics of this 1970’s home that you don’t find in a new build, and yet gave it a complete remodel with new furnishings and modern conveniences. This is a true lake home-the view is lovely and the neighborhood is very quiet. It’s just a short drive to restaurants and groceries and there is an assortment of games and toys for the fam at the house too! Also, the owner is extremely good at responding if you have any questions.

This location makes your Boji trip walkable. The place itself was clean and comfortable. Very minimalist, but has everything you need. Comfy bed and covers. Easy access. We had the North Bay unit, which was your own balcony and that was nice. We didn’t use the games or fire pits or BBQ but knowing they’re available is awesome. Sherri has notes posted so you always know you can reach out and what’s available. I would say this is a good area for younger/more active couples or groups looking for easy access to nightlife and things to do. Very well done, would stay again and I’m clearly recommending. 😊"

Stayed a few nights","Miles accepted our last minute booking at 11:45pm as our initial reservation was in Okoboji and it was not good, so we left that place immediately! We loved Miles’ place so much that we booked it for a second night. Miles’ place was exactly as described! The house is huge and immaculate! Fully stocked kitchen with everything you would need for a get a way. We will definitely return and recommend Miles to other travelers in the area."

Stayed with kids","Great place to stay! We were in town for an event at the fair grounds. It was perfect for us, right down the street from the fairgrounds and close by downtown for coffee and breakfast spots. N64 was a great addition for our downtime, really brought back some childhood memories (we even bought a couple more games from the local store to add to the collection). Only item that wasn't perfect was the shower heads are a bit low, makes it a little annoying for taller people. Overall I would highly recommend, we will likely be back next year (as long as the event is put on again)! Thank you!!"

Stayed with kids","Miles was very responsive and flexible with our group, and the house worked great for what we needed. The other thing that we didn’t expect was probably my fault for missing it in the pictures, but be aware that the room with kids beds and the room with the King bed are separated only by a curtain, so we had to improvise sleeping arrangements a bit since our baby still wakes up in the night and we didn’t want our family to be disturbed in the King bed."

Group trip","The house was very clean and clutter free. Very easy to get there and to get in, clear instructions. Nice and spacious.
The refrigerator and freezer would sporadically work and I felt that he did not believe us. We had to babysit it so our food would not go bad. We had to unplug and re-plug in to get it to maybe work for a few hours. Not too fun.
Also, you just come to expect some amenities like shampoo and a blow dryer and bar soap for the shower to be there.
There were 7 of us there, the exact number to match the beds available. And I think there was one towel for each of us to use for our 4 night/5 day stay.
But, overall, we did enjoy our vacation!"

Stayed with a pet","I had two last minute requests to add my small dog to the reservation and also the need to check in much earlier than expected.
Jay was responsive, and accommodating with both requests. I truly appreciated the flexibility, especially since both were very last minute.
The loft was comfortable, peaceful, exactly as listed, and we felt completely at home.
My partner is very fussy about pillows, and there were more than enough extra pillows to choose from, without even having to request!
We were in town for a wedding, and the loft was quiet, and we were able to keep the bedroom dark to catch some extra zzz’s both mornings.
EXTRA bonus - there was a portable fan already available without request, and we really appreciated this extra touch! No need to haul ours out of our car for use when we slept.
Easy check-in, parking and entrances were described perfectly! We will definitely recommend this listing to others and would love to stay again ourselves next time we are in town!"

There are breakfast places and shops within an easy walk. Be aware light comes in the windows at night. Light sleepers (like me) may want to bring along a sleep mask to block it out. Also be aware you will need to bring your luggage up about 1 1/2 flights of stairs. (A good stretch of the legs.)"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely enjoyed our stay at Jay’s Place. We (family of five with children aged ten and under) were in town for a week to attend a livestock show. Jay’s place was infinitely more comfortable than a hotel and priced cheaper. Plus, the location downtown and walking distance from shops and restaurants in a beautifully restored part of town made our stay feel more like a vacation, less like a slog through a week long show and sale. Jay was so responsive, congenial, and welcoming. The apartment was very comfortable, safe, and private. Just perfect. If our event is held in Spencer again, I will be booking a return stay at Jay’s Place.
A delightful anecdote: We just happened to be there during Spencer’s Flag Fest which included a large parade that began at the fairgrounds, where our event was taking place. Jay was a participant in the parade and he made the effort to look for us on the fairgrounds at our event!"

Bedroom had space to hang clothes, bed was so comfortable, and there was no noise from the outside. There was never a time we felt cramped in this spacious unit. Once we arrived we never needed to get back in our vehicle to drive. We walked and biked everywhere, one of the best features is right on the path is a tunnel to cross the street so crossing traffic is not a concern. This location is close to restaurants and has a beautiful public beach just across the street. We have stayed at other places, as we usually travel to Okoboji 3-4 times a year, and this will always be our first choice when booking in the future. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!"

Stayed one night","Our stay at Sherri’s airbnb was our first stay at an airbnb. It was perfect for our needs. We needed a place for a brief 1 night stay. If we needed the room for a longer stay, Sherri’s place would have been a great place to stay longer. I plan to return to Okaboji next summer and look to return to one of Sherri’s places to stay. I have recommended Sherri’s place to my friends who will be returning to Okaboji next summer to watch and support their daughter who will be working and performing at the Okaboji Summer Theatre."

Great location also and you can walk to many eateries (including the Ritz, Okoboji Store) AND there is a public beach right across the street!

I did know the fees ahead of time and still booked, because the nightly rate was fairly inexpensive. But I would just add that for a 2 night stay, $140 for cleaning is excessive. But the home was great."
