Stayed a few nights","What a great find in the heart of Fells point. Was perfect little place for a family get together for my daughters graduation. We were able to spread out, hang out with a couple of friends for a little graduation gathering. It was perfect. We had everything we needed in the kitchen. The rooftop was an awesome place to sit and just chat, it is at the very end of the busy streets for Fells point so the upper bedroom you could hear the noise and the band playing so if you’re a light sleeper sleep in the basement bedroom. but will absolutely stay there again. Great morning walks around the harbor."

We were in and out a few times and found parking right in front. Lots of restaurants a few steps away as well as nice coffee shop across the street.

Stayed a few nights","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this fully loaded Airbnb in Baltimore's Fells Point, and it exceeded all expectations! The location couldn't be more perfect – right in the heart of everything, yet still tucked away for a peaceful retreat. The attention to detail in the amenities made our stay incredibly comfortable, and the space was thoughtfully designed to comfortably accommodate four guests. From the cozy furnishings to the well-equipped kitchen, every aspect of our stay was thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a fantastic stay in Baltimore!"

Stayed about a week","Two of us had a lovely week's stay at Martin's house in Fell's Point. His home is very comfortable and clean with all amenities. The rooftop deck was an extra treat. Martin was prompt, friendly, and helpful in all communications. The location was prime Fell's Point, just a half block from piers and water views, with restaurants, shops, Broadway market, all around. A fabulous bakery Sacre Sucre just a few doors down, and another, Pitango, right across the street. Martin's place has become our new favorite spot to stay while visiting Baltimore, and we look forward to being there again."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay at Martin’s place! The place was beautiful, from the exposed brick walls to the roof top patio with string lighting, it was exactly what we were hoping for in Baltimore. Check in was a breeze. We arrived a little late and were super hungry, and there were little bars and restaurants all around the immediate walking area, which was perfectly convenient. We ate breakfast each morning at the bakery/cafe directly across the street with a water view and it was perfect in every way. We spent our days there sightseeing, visiting the aquarium, and enjoying the multitude of delicious restaurants nearby. We ended our days relaxing in the jacuzzi bathtub and sipping wine on the rooftop to the beautiful city view. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and plan to revisit the area — and now we know exactly where we’ll stay.
Thank you Martin for the hospitality and the wonderful Airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","Martin’s place looked just like the pictures. It was very nice! There was plenty food options and other places near by in walking distance. We enjoyed our stay. My only complaints would be that there was a few strands of hair on one of the towels that were hanging for us to use and when we turned the jets on in the jacuzzi there was a side that dirt came out of so there were some dirt bubbles and dirt on one side of the jacuzzi so we decided not to use it unfortunately. The shower was great though! Other than that no complaints, everything else was clean!"

Stayed one night","Martin's place was great! My parents and I were in town for a quick overnight before an important doctor's appointment the next morning at Johns Hopkins. The location was so fantastic, and we lucked out and got a parking spot right out front, and Martin provided a parking permit which was very helpful. The home is lovely, clean, and comfortable. The upstairs shower was awesome. The place was as described and exactly what we needed for the quick trip. The neighborhood is pretty incredible - we couldn't believe how many amazing restaurants were super close, within half a block of the house. We had dinner at Penny Black which we absolutely loved. Despite it being a rainy during our stay, I loved walking around the neighborhood and grabbing tea and a cookie at the bakery across the street. I could hear loud music thumping late into the night from somewhere nearby, but I expected that given the vibrant location. I would definitely return to this spot on a future trip to Baltimore."

Stayed a few nights","Martin’s home offered everything our family needed. Our kids had the basement bedroom and bath, we used the upper level bed and bath. We were even able to use the rooftop, which we didn’t expect in December. It was fantastic!!! Martin’s home is clean and well appointed.
To help other travelers, I will mention that the street was loud. This is not at all Martin’s fault or anything he can control but I wish I could have known. The area is home to multiple bars and clubs. While we couldn’t hear the establishments, from 11p-3a every night the street noise of cars, folks talking, music from cars, was a disturbance. For folks visiting for the purpose of nightlife or who are accustomed to city vibes this may not matter. As an aside, the basement bedroom was quiet. We only heard the revelers up in the upstairs bedroom. So a couple traveling alone could just sleep in the basement, which is what we plan to do if/when we venture back sans kids. We still had a great visit!!!"

Stayed one night","Martin’s place checks all of the boxes. I’ve been to many bnb’s between Fells Point and Canton, and this is by far the best. There’s a reason it’s 4.99 stars as of the time of this listing.
Location is perfect. Walking distance to great restaurants, cool bars, the Harbor, and even a killer cafe/bakery on the corner.
House itself is clean and tidy. Beds are very comfy. Internet TV is an incredible plus. Throw blankets to use. Go up to the rooftop for an absolute treat of an experience with a great view of the Harbor.
Martin is a great host and a real gentleman. He was a great communicator and very kind. Got to meet him in person for a couple minutes, and just the epitome of accommodating.
I will always try to stay here in the future when I come to town."

The area is so conveniently placed right on the waterfront in a great neighborhood. We were able to walk and enjoy a variety of places with delicious food. We especially enjoyed sitting in the sun on the rooftop patio with breakfast and coffee.
Martin was very responsive and kind in his communications. We arrived very late on our first night and the instructions that had been provided made getting in and navigating the house super easy."

Stayed about a week","Martin, thank you for sharing your home with us! We had a wonderful time in Fells Point. The location was perfect! Lots to do! We will miss our morning walk enjoying the city life and smelling the freshly baked bread along Aliceanna Street. Whole Foods was within walking distance. Parking was challenging along our street but if you circle the block a few times you can usually get a spot close by. The beds were a little firm for us but having the additional quilts really helped with additional ‘padding’. Loved being able to watch movies without using our login credentials. The kettle was perfect for hot tea and my hubby loved your coffee maker! The deck is fabulous and the view incredible. The master bathroom is great especially the jacuzzi and the massager head in the shower. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was excellent! Martin was very accommodating with check-in/check-out due to airline changes! Martin’s place is a real gem! We look forward to staying here again when we return!"

Location is unmatched - right in the action in Fells Point so you’ll have plenty to do/see while you are here. Coffee, restaurants, bars and shops are within 500 feet of the location. We parked our car the day we arrived and it sat until we left.
Property is clean, decor is well thought of and stylish. There was nothing we needed or would have wanted to have as an amenity. We were visiting for a girls trip so we really appreciated the large stand alone walk-in closet on the second floor and giant bathroom to get ready in! The best part however was the amazing rooftop with unmatched views! We spent hours there enjoying conversations and watching the sun set/rise. If this property is available the next trip to Baltimore we will be booking it!"

But then got the water taxi back to within a block of the house. The rooftop patio was a neat space with warm lights and a table and chairs. Not an amazing view, but not a terrible one, either. We could see water from up there. Martin's communications were prompt and instructions were very clear."

He accommodated our early flight and allowed us to check-in early despite having guests from the previous evening. The townhome is centrally located with many bars and restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood has a really cool vibe and always felt safe. No problems getting Ubers or taking the water taxi which is located nearby. The townhome is newly renovated and all of the amenities are as described. If I'm ever back in Baltimore, I would certainly stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved Martin’s place and our time spent there. The location in Fell’s Point is perfect - easy walks to great restaurants and things to see and do. The parking pass was a wonderful help, we never had difficulty finding a spot on the street. The house is spotless, comfortable, and very nicely updated. The upstairs bed was comfortable, and the upstairs bathroom is gigantic and very well appointed. The upstairs was a little warm thanks to Mother Nature, but it was never a problem. As others have noted, this place is right in the middle of the Fell’s Point nightlife, so you will hear some people in various states of revelry. If you need complete peace and quiet, it may not be ideal for you. If you like people watching/listening and don’t mind a little commotion, this place is ideal. We would definitely stay at Martin’s place again."

Stayed a few nights","Martin and his Fells Point home are wonderful! It was a five star experience all around with two exceptions. The top floor was a bit hot (Martin offered to come and show how to fix the AC radiator when I mentioned it to him) and the street can be loud at night (we had to call the cops because a group outside was super loud. Both of these things - Baltimore summer heat and party summer nights - are out of Martin’s control.
Would highly recommend to anyone !"

Stayed a few nights","Martin's charming house in the heart of Fell's Point was a perfect retreat for my wife and me. We enjoyed two delightful nights exploring the vibrant neighborhood and witnessing an exciting Yankees vs. Orioles game at Camden Yards. The immaculate house provided all the essential amenities, and Martin's thoughtful provision of a parking pass secured us a spot right in front for the entire weekend.
The rooftop was a highlight, offering a lovely view as we savored our morning coffee from Daily Grind. Our Inner Harbor excursion on game day was effortless, thanks to the nearby Baltimore Water Taxi.
We truly enjoyed Fell's Point with its enchanting shops, lively bars, and delectable restaurants. As a lesbian couple, we always research our travel destinations and were thrilled to find Fell's Point to be a diverse and welcoming community, allowing us to stroll around and feel safe.
Thank you again, Martin. If we return to Baltimore, we will undoubtedly choose your inviting home once more."

Stayed one night","Our overnight stay at Martin's home was wonderful! The home was exactly as pictured and had everything we needed. The whole place was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the water pressure was perfect, and the living room was a cozy place to hang out. The neighborhood is walkable and the house was close to many restaurants, bars, and small shops. We only wished we had stayed more than one night! We had the opportunity to meet Martin at the end of our stay and he was very friendly and accommodating. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Fells Point we highly recommend staying at Martin's home, and we look forward to future stays!"

Stayed a few nights","Martin’s home is a great oasis in the Fells Point area. As someone who spends a lot of time in hotels and air bnb’s, I am very particular and it was great to see Martin is as well. His home is located in the perfect place on the street, plenty of parking available in front of the home and he provides the necessary parking pass. The area is quiet but there is plenty of activity so you do not feel isolated if traveling alone. Martin gave excellent information about accessing the home, very detailed information to make you feel at home and is not overbearing. The home set up is perfect if traveling with a family or friends/colleagues. Great water pressure, cold A/C, and iron and ironing board (necessary for me). He provides ample towels and bed linens, laundry detergent, wipes, paper towels, etc to last your entire stay. High end appliances and stoneware in the kitchen and an overall great environment. I will definitely stay here again. A+Thanks again Martin."

The rooftop patio area was unique and it was very nice to just plug in the soft glow patio lights in the evening and enjoy the view. The WiFi for the TVs throughout the home provided very good speed for streaming Netflix, YouTube etc. Pictures accurately show the home. The main level has living room, kitchen and a half bath and downstairs is a bedroom and full bath and upstairs a MBR and bath with separate shower and jacuzzi. The location is very convenient to the thriving Fells Point area and we enjoyed the water taxis access, restaurants and theater there. A bakery and cafe right across the street had great breakfast foods too. All in all, we appreciated Martin’s professionalism. The waters in the fridge so much appreciated too. Thank you!"

The location is central to Fells Point and very walkable. Be aware that the neighborhood can get very noisy late at night — so if you’re a light sleeper, choose the bedroom in the basement. And consider bringing your own pillow(s) if you want to avoid a stiff neck when you wake up. The pillows in the unit are rather bulky and have very little give. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay!"

The house was very well stocked except for facial tissues - orherwise had everything. Martin was helpful, proactive, and responsive. Light sleepers should be prepared to sleep in the basement bedroom because the upstairs master gets a lot of noise from the surrounding nightlife, but it's worth it to be in the heart of all the action. we loved relaxing on the rooftop deck morning and night."

Our stay at Kenneth’s place in Baltimore was exceptional. Nestled in a fantastic neighborhood, it’s centrally located yet remarkably peaceful, offering the best of both worlds. We were just steps away from great dining, the scenic harbor, and lovely parks.
The house itself impressed us with its thoughtful design and comfort. It’s equipped with everything we needed - from entertainment options with great TVs to practical needs like a well-functioning laundry room, efficient heating, and pristine bathrooms. The beds were a dream to sleep in.
A special mention must go to the rooftop deck - a serene spot to enjoy some quiet moments. Kenneth’s attention to detail and guest comfort really shone through, making our stay both memorable and comfortable. We’re already looking forward to coming back. This place is a true Baltimore gem!"

We took a walk around the area, people were out walking their dogs and everyone was very friendly. The roof top patio that is part of Kenneth's place is a wonderful area to hang out and have a cocktail or two. In fact, if you run out of your favorite adult beverage, a wine, beer and spirit shop is a short walk away. If we end up in Baltimore again, we will certainly try to book with Kenneth again! He's a super host for sure."

Very much liked the quality of the beds and the extreme clean of that unit. The rooftop patio was a bonus, so much fun hanging out up there. We plan to stay here again during our next visit to Baltimore."

The host was up late enough to help us locate the TV remote so that we could change the settings because we are so picky. The tea and the bedrooms, the rooftop and the lighting, every aspect was ideal. I wish I owned a place like that! I would happily return."

My only complaint was parking but it is better during the day than night next time I will park and Uber around or ride a scooter. The last people that rented probably forgot to cover the chairs back up outside so unfortunately they were wet but the scenery was still nice10/10

Stayed with kids","Overall our stay was very good. It was my son, my husband, my mom, step-dad and me. It was very clean and met our needs. It was nice that the home came with a variety of extras like laundry soap. The place is smaller than we thought. My sister lives in the area and we assumed it was about the same. It is noticeable narrower. Made it difficult with 5 people.
There were a few safety things to keep in mind with young kids. Base of the stairs has open staples and there is only a hand rail on one side. It is completely open on the other side.
Would we stay here again? Yes. It met our needs with being close to the park. If there weren't the safety issue it would have been a 5 star stay for us!"

The master bedroom and bathroom give you the, ""I'm on a vacation in a bungalow on an island vibe."" And the rooftop is wonderful! I can imagine staying up there all night on a perfect summer night.

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at this beautifully decorated row house with a fabulous rooftop deck! Everything looks newly purchased and newly renovated - we were excited to find such a great place! The furnishings are so pretty, it made us feel like we were staying in a very nice, comfortable home rather than a rental. The kitchen was surprisingly large with beautiful countertops and top quality appliances. Both of the bedrooms and bathrooms are upstairs and the stairs are a bit narrow, which was not a problem for us at all but could be if you have mobility restrictions. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms very nice. It was definitely one of the nicer Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in, especially for such a great price!
Kenneth was a wonderful host, and we highly recommend this place. We’ll definitely book it again!"

Ken made sure that the entire process was smooth by ensuring that I had the code to check in and access to wifi. Fantastic communication. I did have to park a few blocks away from the townhouse, but it was worth it and I felt very safe in this area. I am visiting Baltimore for the 1st time and I was able to get to all of my planned locations within 10 minutes . A++"

Stayed one night","This is a gorgeous houseboat. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and very well appointed. Thoughtful touches throughout make the stay special--e.g., stainless steel chopsticks, battery-operated candles, wine fridge, and cozy wool blankets on the top deck. We cooked in (why eat out when the twinkling lights of the Inner Harbor are all around you), and the kitchen was well stocked with high quality pots, pans, appliances and dinnerware. The interior design is spectacular. We especially loved the shower!! Privacy shades throughout the boat make it easy to close off the view from outside to inside. We stayed overnight on a Saturday and the waterfront was very lively and fun to watch. Surprisingly, everything quieted down by about 10:00 p.m. (perhaps there is a noise ordinance on the harbor?) and it was very quiet to sleep overnight. Most of the boats in the marina were empty, but several friendly dock dogs passed by with their owners on Sunday morning. We loved Flohom 01!"

Communication with Brian was easy throughout our stay and he was extremely accommodating, which helped to make our stay enjoyable. The FLOHOM is an excellent lodging option when visiting Baltimore while on vacation or on a staycation . This luxury houseboat has all the amenities you could possibly need during your stay with the best panoramic views of the city’s Inner Harbor. The rooftop deck offers the best front row seat to the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets. There are a lot of special touches added to help make your stay memorable, to include an amazing FLOHOM playlist that you can easily stream from your smartphone to add to the ambiance of the FLOHOM experience. Highly recommend choosing Brian to be your host during your next trip to Baltimore."

This charming space, nestled on the tranquil waters, provided a serene escape from the bustling city life. We couldn't have asked for a more picturesque setting to unwind and recharge.
Brian, our gracious host, went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional. From the moment we arrived, he warmly welcomed us, sharing his wealth of knowledge about the area and offering valuable insider tips on local attractions and hidden gems. His genuine hospitality truly made us feel like treasured guests.
We cannot recommend this Airbnb listing enough. If you're seeking a place of tranquility, with a host who embodies genuine warmth and hospitality, look no further than this beautiful boathouse in Annapolis. Our stay exceeded our expectations, and we left with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you, Brian, for sharing this slice of serenity with us. We hope to return someday soon."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Gerald’s place with a colleague. We were in town for a conference and his location is fantastic. If you prefer an AirBnB versus a hotel, this place is minutes from the convention center and very walkable to other fun amenities like the aquarium, baseball, football stadiums, and food scene. Federal Hill was my favorite area to eat and it was a 10-15 minute walk south. Gerald was very responsive and proactively communicated with us before we arrived and before we departed to make sure everything was okay. The place feels bigger in person and was very clean. I was very comfortable hanging out in my room and working in the common area. One bedroom has a bathroom and the other has a bathroom in the hallway. All this to say that me and my colleague felt like we had our own spaces, which was great. I would stay here again the next time I visit Baltimore. Thanks Gerald!"

Several couches and TVs if needed for guests. Entire apartment and bathrooms were totally spotless, couldn't see even one speck of dust, seemed like a brand new place.

The rooms do not have black out curtains but the harbor front wall is less than 2 blocks away. The parking pass allows you to park directly under the bedroom windows. The condo is walking distance to the convention center and baseball stadium and downtown, the area further south gets more residential and posh. this is Baltimore, there is construction and the homeless population has continued to grow. My coworker and I shared the place while were in town at the Orpheum and it really made every single day better for us. We appreciated all the comfy beds, great showers, great living space, and ease of getting in and out."

Talking about 100% transparency!! We felt in love this place specially they have best bed. They are so comfortable and you can tell difference as soon as you laid down after long walking. I stayed couple of air&b place before but this place have bed bed mattress!!! Location was very good too. They are very close working to inner harbor area. We went for my God daughter’s graduation so we didn’t get to visit baseball field but it was very close to baseball field as well. Host was amazing. He was able to work with us check in and check out and gave us very clear direction so I have zero difficulties during my stay at this place and will go back for sure!!

Stayed with kids","This is a wonderfully comfortable, well-curated, and extremely well-located condo near the Inner Harbor of Baltimore. We slept well, had all we needed in the condo, and benefitted from excellent communication from our host, Gerry. We were in Baltimore with our two children, and the space suited us well, particularly having two bathrooms, a well-equipped kitchen, and ample seating for meals and relaxing. My kids have already asked us to consider renovating our bathroom to be more like the one in the condo: think great water pressure and a nicely set up master-shower.
We appreciated the on-site parking, keyless entry, smart home set-up, laundry, and sense of privacy. Though we were in a block of condos, we didn't hear any neighbors for the duration of our stay.
This is a second floor walk-up, which worked fine for us, but would be a consideration for anyone else. It is within walking distance to the Inner Harbor, Camden Yards, and Federal Hill (where we enjoyed a number of great meals).
On the whole, we couldn't recommend this place more highly. It was one of the nicest AirBnB we've stayed in."

it was great to have a private parking space so we didn't have a problem with the car.
the appartment was everything you see on the pictures. In a nice part of the town.

Kitchen is well equipped, beds are super comfortable, and open living room area with large screen tv was perfect for hanging out with family. Location was very close to waterfront area and an easy drive to many great restaurants. A bonus was the gated parking area adjacent to the building (one car) and street parking passes (two cars).

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at Laura’s and it was a nice Air BNB! I personally like to have more details about where we’re going to be staying so some details for reference:
It is a smaller space, the couch is made of an interesting but itchy material, if you have sensitive skin be careful!
The kitchenette area is beautiful!! You may want to bring your own brita or buy water as Baltimore Water is not the best.
Water pressure everywhere was amazing, the shower gets very hot and it is so nice!!
The bed is cozy, it has a foam topper on top with a mattress protector. There is also luggage stands which is AWESOMS. There are also fans and a tv in the bedroom. It is wonderful.
The back patio was nice, it is shared just at an FYI.
Baltimore itself was Baltimore. The stairs to the door were dirty and had litter around it. The location was okay but there was the smell of weed from nearby homes and businesses.
The place was very nice overall, just wanted to add important details!"

The place was clean and—as Floridians who get cold if it dips below 80—we appreciated the additional blankets and towels. Laura is also proactive about soliciting feedback to improve future guests’ stays, which made us feel right at home. Last but not least: it’s a great location walkable to plenty of shops, restaurants, and attractions (including plenty of vegan options!)."

Stayed with a pet",This was our second time staying with Laura. The last time was about 6 months previous and we were relieved when we were planning to go back to Baltimore for work and we found her place was available again. The apartment is cozy and extremely well supplied. It's stylish and modern and very comfortable. The neighborhood is great too. Tons of great restaurants and bars and coffee shops. Whole Foods is nearby too. I highly recommend this for your stay.

Laura was an amazing host. Attentive, transparent, and accommodating. I arrived into the city much earlier than anticipated and long before the check-in time. Laura had informed me that the unit wasn’t ready yet for our stay, but was so accommodating to let me check-in early and drop bags off so I wasn’t traveling with them around the city until it was ready. Laura was prompt to respond to questions and made the stay here all the more enjoyable. I will be saving this one for when I travel to Baltimore in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","Laura's place is excellent. It is newly renovated and clearly has an interior designer's or artist's touch. It's a garden-level apartment, but it doesn't feel like one at all. Their is plenty of natural light and the apartment itself has lots of light tones that brighten the place up. They really make the most out of the available space with tons of creative storage especially in the kitchen and bathroom. My wife and I are thinking of finishing our basement at home and we literally took video of Laura's place to derive inspiration from. It's cozy, modern and comfortable. And the location is amazing. Parking was a breeze because Laura provided a parking pass for the street. At all times I was able to park right in front of the front door. And the house is in an incredibly walkable neighborhood close to restaurants, bars, coffer shops, grocery stores, you name it. Great, great value and I hope we can stay here again in the future."

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I, and our little dog had a very nice stay at Laura’s place. Cozy and comfortable is a good description. Attractively furnished and decorated, clean and very good floor plan that maximizes space. Modest kitchenette, but very functional. We made breakfast and lunch there every day during our visit. Very nice modern bathroom with a huge shower, and very comfortable bed. Location was terrific, just one block from the main restaurant row in Little Italy. Also easy walking distance to the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. We were in Baltimore for medical appointments at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and it was an easy drive of less than 10 minutes. Parking was never a problem, we always found a spot on the street within a few steps .
Laura was a terrific host, proactive and responsive. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again for future trips."

Stayed with a pet","Laura's home is welcoming with inspired design choices and great lighting. We immediately felt at home.
The kitchenette had everything we needed, even though we mostly ate out at the fabulous restaurants all within walking distance. Ovenbird Bakery is a MUST in the morning.
We felt safe walking from her home to Fells Point and the surrounding area.
Street parking was so easy that we didn't have to use the dedicated parking spot she offered. We never worried about driving somewhere outside of walking distance because neighborhood parking was always a breeze.
Sifting through reviews and neighborhoods to find an AirBNB in Baltimore took a lot of time. Save yourself search time and book Laura's home!
We'll likely do another weekend getaway in Baltimore and when we do, we will be booking with Laura."

We were also able to bring our small elderly dog who seemed to feel right at home. This is really great bc it’s getting harder to leave him. We took him in his doggie stroller to Fells Point.

The place has it all: well stocked kitchen, compact oven, coffee maker, dishwasher, amazing modern shower, washer & dryer, small office area, tv’s in both the living room & bedroom, super comfortable mattress (best sleep I’ve had in a while!), and a beautiful courtyard for morning pastries from the nearby must-try Ovenbird bakery.
Parking was a breeze even on Friday evening, and the nearby restaurant scene is incredible (check out The Elk Room for live jazz in a speakeasy environment). The location is perfect, nestled in a quiet neighborhood, yet within walking distance of a more lively scene if desired. We loved it so much, we extended our stay a few more nights! Laura was extremely responsive and flexible with our requests."

The neighborhood gets pretty quiet and most places are closed after 9 or 10, but Fell's Point is a ten minute walk so there's still plenty of late-night stuff within walking distance if that's your scene.
All-in-all it's a great space, we're already talking about booking here again the next time we're in Baltimore."

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic option for anyone looking for a place to stay in Charles Village or near JHU! The space was clean and well designed with beautiful hardwood floors, a lovely bricked-up fire place, and gorgeous west-facing windows overlooking historic St. Paul St. Yang was very clear in his instructions, and we were able to access the building and the unit with ease. Parking was simple, free, and unlimited on Saturdays & Sundays. The unit had everything we needed - a comfy bed, a solid couch, a modern and clean bathroom, Keurig, mini-fridge, and microwave.
The location is really spectacular. You are spitting distance from the Waverly Farmers Market, the BMA, Normal's Bookstore, and Motzi Bread. Just a bit further (but still about a 15 min walk), you can go to Clavel, R-House, Paper Moon Diner, and Charmington's. If this is available, book it!"

Stayed one night","This place was perfect for a short stay, and Yang was a responsive host. I needed to be close to Johns Hopkins University's Homewood campus, and this apartment, a unit in a townhouse, was probably a 5 minute walk from the campus. It is also just a block away from a bunch of restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores, and a small grocery store. The bed was super comfortable. I loved the cute coffee nook. The place has big windows for a view of the street below, but thick curtains for privacy. Traveling alone for this overnight trip, I also felt safe in the neighborhood and in the building."

Comfortable bed. My partner and I are not light sleepers so the floors creaking did not bother us, but if you are a light sleeper maybe bring some ear plugs or something. Also the kitchenette area is best suited for people who will be eating out! You cannot prepare anything more than maybe tea and some coffee here. Not a complaint for me personally- but just a warning for those interested in an extended stay. Overall, lovely place in a quiet neighborhood."

The room is spacious with lots of light. You can hear the tenants in other rooms, outdoors, and the floors are a bit creaky. My husband was ok, but I am a sensitive sleeper.
There is a very steep long flight of stairs leading to the room, so if you are loaded or have physical issues, it might be a problem. The area is very safe and pleasant to walk.
The place is clean, there is small fridge and glasses/bowls.
Would come stay here again."

Stayed one night","From the description we did not expect a mini hotel with every room being rented--we thought it was a home with a guest suite.
It was noisy -- was kept awake by people walking in hallways and upstairs (and having fun late at night) and the noise of the very loud air conditioning fan and the shower noise from other rooms.
In the morning we felt that every step we took creaked so loudly that we were probably disturbing others.
It was too warm at night and we had no control of air in our room. (we tried lowering the temp on the 3rd floor but someone else then raised it).
The mattress seemed overly well used with an indentation--sleeping right in the center was ok, but....
I'd recommend carpeting the floors and figuring out some other noise muting tactics."

Stayed over a week","I loved both the room and the neighborhood. Yang is an excellent host, always replying to non-urgent messages within a few hours and the one urgent one I sent almost immediately (I got locked out of my room, and he fixed it right away.) The light during daytime hours is beautiful. There's a very comfortable sofa in front of tall bay windows, and I think that's where I spent most of my time. There is no reading lamp, so if you're a reader bring a tablet for after dark. There are two small groceries a block away, as well as many reasonably priced casual restaurants. The art museum is 1/4 mile walk. The bus stop is just over a block away, Purple busses are free, and Penn station (with two options for trains to DC) is only one bus away. The neighborhood is mostly airbnb and other rentals, but it's very quiet and people here are extremely friendly."

I would definitely recommend this space, especially if you're going to be busy exploring the city - it's in a great location (Charles Village neighborhood), and close to food, cafes, bars, just a few blocks away from the Baltimore Museum of Art, a short trip to the cute Hampden neighborhood, and walking distance to public transit stops.

Stayed a few nights","Very convenient to JHU and easy to check in and out. Comfortable bed and furnishings, and fairly represented. Not sure if there are bedrooms on the first floor, but the second and third floor bedrooms would be very challenging to reach for anyone with mobility issues. Reasonably priced; We would consider staying again."

Stayed a few nights","The entire space is private but everything happening upstairs could be heard by the guests, and likely vice versa. The hosts have a dog and child which can be heard very easily from the AirBnB in the basement. Also, we had issues with the lock on multiple occasions, including during check-in with the host. Also, the HVAC for the AirBnB cannot be controlled by the guest, so it gets pretty cold in the winter. They provide space heaters, though.
Hampden is amazing but it's not a particularly central Baltimore location. This AirBnB should be priced at a lower rate given the lack of privacy, space, and ability to control the HVAC."

Stayed over a week","This location is AMAZING! So close to many restaurants, shopping, groceries, not to mention a big park. Hampden is a picturesque neighborhood and lovely to walk around.
It's also AMAZING to have a parking space at this location!
I so appreciated the small touches in this apartment — reusable shopping bags, adult coloring books, toiletries, a throw blanket, many types of tea, and games.
Rachel was a great communicator. She reached out to let us know about traffic issues during a neighborhood parade. She also left out a recycling bin for us to use before we left.
My only warning: this is a basement apartment, and it's cold in the winter! Space heaters and the throw blanket help, but be prepared for cooler temps if you're staying in the winter.
I 100% recommend staying in this apartment!"

The hosts thought of everything to provide their guests. A huge bonus was the use of the parking space, and the surrounding neighborhood has everything you could imagine! The hosts offer themselves up for suggestions (if the traveler is interested) and even provided the guest with lots of menus to check out some of the food options ahead of exploring!

Stayed a few nights","Perfect location. Less than 5 minute walk to the Avenue. Having use of the parking pad is a HUGE bonus, as parking in Hampden can be a challenege!
Had the pleasure of meeting both hosts and their adorable pup! It was comforting to know they were there if we needed anything, and they fully respected our privacy. Great communication, responsive, provided recommendations of places to check out.
Apartment was perfect for the two of us. Double bed is super comfortable. Kuerig (and K-cups) and Brita dispenser there for your use. Really nice shower - shampoo, conditioner and soap provided, along with a few other toiletries, in case you forget!
We will absolutely stay here again in the future. Highly recommend."

Stayed about a week","This was a high-value stay with a really good location in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore. The basement apartment is immaculate, with plenty of space for my mom, who was visiting us for the week.
Rachel and her husband were excellent communicators and made sure to reach out to us at various points of the stay. There was one point where the WiFi went out for a few hours, but we were kept in the loop throughout and the situation was resolved quickly.
The parking is a little tricky to get in and out of, but by Baltimore standards it’s not that bad. In fact, it’s a godsend to have your own space 24/7, especially in such a dense row house neighborhood.
We enjoyed our stay and hope we can stay again."

Because this is a basement apartment and we visited in summer, we weren’t totally surprised to see a few large cockroaches in the living room and bathroom on both nights of our stay. Bugs aside, this place is very clean and tidy. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend."

Stayed with kids","Rachel was very responsive and pleasant. The space was clean and as advertised, though it turned out to be somewhat small for our family of two adults and two children (ages 9 and 5). The walls are somewhat thin, so we did hear people walking around upstairs quite a bit. This didn't bother us, but we are city dwellers and used to hearing neighbors.
The neighborhood (Hampden) was fun to explore -- there are cool restaurants and shops within a short walk. We explored multiple local coffee shops and generally had a nice stay."

Overall, an excellent experience in a great space with a wonderful host."

The place was perfect for a couple. The parking pad in the back is really convenient. They really have thought of everything! They provided coffee, tea, paper plates, shampoo, etc. It is well decorated and cozy! My husband and I enjoyed playing the board games. I only feedback we would give is that the computer monitor/speaker as a TV is complicated and a little small. We couldn't get it to work, but we also didn't take the time to ask for further instruction. A small smart TV would be more convenient. It would also be really nice to let the guests control the temperature with a window a/c unit. We were a little hot at night even with the fast fan! Please note: we stayed in the heat of July, so this is to be expected! There are two space heaters in the place for the winter months! These things did not ruin our stay at all, we just wanted to share our thoughts! Big thanks to the great hosts!"

My only note is that there’s no real TV, it’s a monitor with a chromecast (just something to be aware as of it took me a moment to realize). Having never used one, I was too tired that evening upon realizing to figure it out. I’m sure if I had noticed sooner in the day, or was staying longer it wouldn’t have been an issue, or I could have asked for assistance - hosts were amazingly responsive to all of my questions and I highly highly recommend!"

The host is communicative and helpful. The place was clean, equipped with games and tv was readily logged on for Netflix and other steaming services. And the location was so close to Inner Harbor and in safe Little Italy.
P.s. no designated parking spot but no worries - Little Italy garage is close by, safe and not expensive!
I plan to come to Baltimore more often now that my oldest is coming here for college, so I would definitely rent out this space again!!
Obviously if I would return, I would absolutely recommend to other AirBnB guests!"

The artwork in the space created a lovely sense of peace along with the full view of the garden right outside the window. Everything in the space was carefully chosen and beautifully arranged.

We appreciated having loads of privacy, as well as easy access from the street to our room (without feeling we were disturbing the hosts).
There are many restaurants, entertainment options, & the Inner Harbor within walking distance or a quick Uber ride from the property.
We recommend: The Blue Moon Cafe for b'fast/brunch & The Port for local comedy.
We had the privilege of meeting Scott and his darling canine companion, which turned out to be a bonus to a wonderful trip!

I love the artsy feel of the place and the access to a garden/patio space is so welcome vs. being in a generic hotel room with windows that don't open!"

Stayed a few nights","Scott and Jennifer were really responsive and very friendly throughout the whole process. Being able to rent the garage was a great added bonus and made this a great home base for a few days. The place was very clean, the code system was easy to use, and the view into the back garden was lovely.
You are sharing the building so you do hear them above you (or smell cooking), but it didn't bother us - just something to keep in mind. For the price it was a great deal and Scott and Jennifer made everything really easy by being so proactive and thoughtful."

It’s also centrally located and they were super helpful offering dinner recommendations and info about the neighborhood.

The location was perfect for my needs, the shower had great water pressure, and the garden was lovely. Street parking was easy to find less than a block from the house.
For two, you might find the room to be a little small, but it was perfect for me. Everything was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Designed for those looking for a peaceful, quiet retreat, there is no television. Instead, they offer games! There is also reliable and fast wi-fi if you must use your computer. My only suggestion would be to add a small refrigerator and/or an electric kettle.
Note: do not be confused if you look on G* Maps and see a different house! Jennifer and Scott did a complete rebuild a few years ago."

Stayed one night","Staying at Jen and Scott’s Secret Garden is like having good friends in Baltimore who let you use their MIL suite. It’s clean and comfy, well constructed- right down to heated floors and a properly sloped shower floor so it drains well. The place is tiny but has everything we needed for a short getaway from home. Wish it had been less rainy so we could have hung out in the backyard! Love this neighborhood, where it’s easy to walk to our favorite spots: Patterson Park, Corner Juice Bar, Ekiben, coffee shops, Ministry of Brewing, and the water. Parking was a little tight when we arrived in the rain after 5, but it worked out after a few times circling the block. And Charlie, their dog, gives kisses if you let her, which is an added bonus for us!"

Stayed one night","My partner and I only had one night's stay in Jennifer and Scott's spacious bedroom/bathroom place, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were given very clear instructions for the entire experience there. They were friendly and very responsive responsive to our questions, and were flexible on our departure time. We were impressed on the art and design of the entire space, and would have used the attractive back yard space, just outside our bedroom, had it been warmer outside. We will definitely return if the occasion arises."

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer and Scott have a very lovely home and I felt super comfortable staying with them. I was attending a music festival in baltimore and they were very accommodating with my check in time. The code to get in was very useful as I was unable to check in until very late. I didn’t see them much during my stay as I was busy but for the short times I did they were both extremely kind and helpful. If I come to the festival again next year I definitely hope I can stay at their home again! Also, the Blue Moon Cafe was a delicious recommendation for a late breakfast. Super cool place only a couple minute walk. Feeling like I was in a safe place was very important to me as I was coming in late and by myself and I was not worried at all staying with them. Thanks again Jenn and Scott!"

And for anything farther, the electric scooters, Uber and public transportation should suffice.
The luggage rack in the closet was also a nice touch. One piece of advice for anyone using the keypad — the “unlock” button needs to be held down for a couple of seconds after entering the code or it won’t work. Overall, a great experience and highly recommended. 👌🏼"

Stayed a few nights","A little tricky to locate for the first time but absolutely worth it for the comfort, hospitality, and friendliness of the hosts.
As a woman traveling alone to a city with a rough reputation, I was nervous taking the risk of staying at an AirB&B several blocks from where I’d be for work, but those nerves were quickly dispelled!
Scott and Jenn were welcoming, helped me get oriented and had me feeling like family within the first few hours. I could hang out and chat with them in the common areas or have absolute privacy in my room. Sharing the main bathroom was never an issue, I had fridge space and full use of the kitchen, and Scott went above and beyond helping me get laundry done even with an out of service washing machine.
The house is an easy walk to the inner harbor and I did it daily for a conference. If I was out after dark I took a Lyft (in the advice of four different locals—it is a city), and the scooters available through Uber were easy to find and a lot of fun to get around on.
There is a Whole Foods within a few blocks so grocery shopping was no-stress, and another block from there was a Starbucks (I’m from Seattle, it’s an addiction, I’ll own it). I was a little overzealous one day and walked all the way to Fort McHenry (caught a Lyft back) so while I don’t necessarily recommend doing that, it tells you how walkable everything is.
Highly recommended and I hope to stay there again next time I’m in town."

Stayed a few nights",We decided to take in Baltimore on a budget and Scott and Jenn help made this possible. Their beautiful space is perfectly located within walking distance to Fells Point. There is a parking garage around the corner that had $4 daily specials on the weekends that is clean and safe. During the week it cost me $21 a day. Scott provided us tips on locations and answered all our questions. The space is clean and it was a special treat for me to have french pressed coffee in the morning. All this contributed to making our trip to Baltimore an exciting adventure.

Stayed about a week","Pros: If you are planning to visit downtown, the location of the suit is great. Silent and calm location. Close to the car park. We loved the location and silent nature of the place. All the stuff is ready to use and enough for your needs.
Cons: Except in summer, if you are seeking for warm place the air condition can not be enough for you. There is an additional electric heater but it will take time to feel warm. We had this feeling for the first 2 days because the weather was cold outside. The curtains could be cleaner but not a big issue for us except cosmetic look.
Neutral comment: Yes, there is an issue with the disturbing walking sound coming from the upper floor. On the other hand, people should learn how to walk while staying in a rental place. Nothing to say about this to owner according to us.
In general, there are some topics for development but the suit offers more than enough compared its the price."

Stayed a few nights","Keith was very friendly and responsive as I got into Baltimore. I was able to easily find the unit and get into the parking garage. The area was extremely walkable, parking was easy to access and I felt safe walking around, getting to restaurants, etc.
A few things that were not explicitly mentioned in the listing:
- There were other people in the unit above me and I could hear them on the stairs and in their unit
- There's a thin curtain that separates the sliding glass door from the outside and across the way is the kitchen of other unit
- The heater is above the door and only warms one third of the room and there were no extra comforters; if you're someone who runs cold, bring sweatshirts
- The alley used to get to the unit was very narrow; wearing a backpack or carrying larger luggage made it hard to maneuver with the gate.
Overall the stay was great! I really enjoyed the location and having somewhere nice to stay."

Stayed a few nights",I liked my stay here a lot. It was a peaceful spot--even though it is on a busy street it feels a bit tucked away because it is behind the other house. Walkable to nice areas of Fells Point (Ekiben is great food and very close). There was cute decor there too. My only complaint is check-in--it could have been clearer in the description of how to get in. I wasn't sure which house it was and did not want to accidentally go into the wrong one so waited a bit. If you go here I recommend checking in during the day so it's easier. Keith was responsive and a nice host however and this place has a good vibe.

Stayed a few nights","This was a great place for me - one person who spent the days elsewhere (visiting family) so just needed a comfortable bed (check 1) and a great shower (check 2) and strong Wifi (check 3). It was attractive and comfortable, including a good desk chair. I didn't use the kitchen, except for drinks in the fridge, so no comments on that. On my last day, my family drove down to see the place (and they loved it), and then we walked to Whole Foods for breakfast and then on to the inner harbor for morning fun.
Parking was easy - I found a spot on Caroline each time I returned to the apartment. But it was reassuring to have the long instructions on how to find parking elsewhere had I needed it.
There was some street noise on Thursday night but weirdly not on Friday or Saturday - or maybe I just adjusted to it :-)
Instructions were very clear but still, Keith answered the questions that I did have quickly and clearly.
Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, the hosts were proactive and friendly, and even shared a list of recommended things to do in the area. I was only in for work, but staying in a converted art gallery was an interesting change of pace. For the most part, everything was fine, and the space itself was surprisingly insulated from noises on the street. The only thing that really surprised me was how thin the ceiling/walls were. I was able to hear every footstep that the person upstairs took, which was particularly disruptive for me as they were most active around midnight.
The hosts do have some solutions for this, such as a white noise machine or earbuds (and have them in the space if you do need them), but just be aware of this ahead of time if you're a light sleeper. In the future, I'd probably make sure to be on the second floor to avoid this (or bring earplugs of my own)."

If you have never been to Baltimore it's a really small big city with a lot to do in a small area.
Lots of museums, observation deck with cool views, Fort McHenry, lots of good eateries and places to grab a nice drink.
Their place is within walking distance to pretty much everything and what I personally liked best is that there is no TV so it really allows you to get out and enjoy what the city has to offer.
Good solid choice if you don't need to have a TV when you're exploring a new city."

My only concern was one that is my own and out of hosts control, blond small female rolling her suitcase and carryon around homeless and sketch people down on their luck after I parked in the garage. Super happy I checked in before dark to get my bearings. My friend who lives in BWI stayed with me that night and basically said,"" it's Baltimore"" and shrugged her shoulders. Anyway carry pepper spray ladies if you're alone or plan on walking down to fells point and back at night or even to the whole foods a few blocks down. The parking garage was only $4 after 4 pm for the whole night which is awesome. Safe travels and seriously enjoy this awesome setup they have created (no TV was perfect for me)."

I was afraid it would be noisy since it’s right off multiple bus lines, but the apartment was far enough back from the road and with the provided fan in the apartment, I fell right asleep! The place matched the pictures perfectly with a comfortable bed. The hosts were fantastic, responsive, and provided me with many local recommendations. I took the busses to get to/ from Penn Station and the free City Circular to explore other areas around Baltimore. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough good things about Jen and Scott's place! The studio was a comfortable size, very clean, and stocked full of little extras that we could access (i.e., extra towels, blankets, etc.) My husband and I were both able to work remotely out of the space for a few hours during the day with no issue. The surrounding area is quiet and had easy, free street parking. We walked to dinner one night with no issues.
The real selling point, however, is how much thought has been put into the overall experience. Jen was super responsive via text the whole time we were in town, and the instructions for how to access the space, check-in and check-out procedures, etc. were clearly laid out in advance. It was overall a pleasure staying at the studio, and we'd happily return in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Great value stay in cool location. Once inside, a welcome binder shows the backstory of the space, and it's impressive how the hosts have transformed this into a modern yet inviting place to stay! The place was so unique, clean, quiet, and comfortable for our stay. I enjoyed being so close to Fells and Harbor East.
5/5 overall, but solvable points of feedback for the benefit of future guests:
> I had an unannounced 11AM host visit, which interrupted a presentation I was making over Zoom. I didn't respond to the first two sets of knocks, but felt compelled on the third. The host wanted to pick up paint he forgot in the room. Given we had already established contact via app, I didn't understand why the owner couldn't message me to avoid an interruption and my feeling unsafe about who was requesting access.
> A few details in the binder / first-day messaging (e.g. metered parking, process for physical keys) would be useful in listing or confirmation for fully informed booking. Thanks!"

Made it really easy to plan our day. They both communicated fast and are very accommodating. We flew in from TX and landed at 9am. We were able to leave our luggage at their residence until it was time to check in (they live around the corner). It was a rainy day and Jen/Scott ensured our room was ready early and moved our luggage for us. Truly went above and beyond. Not to mention, left us some waters and umbrellas. My husband always complains about where we sleep i.e. the mattress is too hard or too soft. I'll just say, he slept like a baby. Would and will definitely recommend."

The communication was great with the hosts and there is a small outdoor space for coffee in the morning. We enjoyed our stay.

And small fridge really. But convenient and cozy. Guest was responsive and nice. Left snacks and ear plugs which I thought was because of being on a busy street, but come 3am I found out it was because of a very noisy upstairs neighbor…. Loud footsteps, sounded like marbles rolling on the ground and jumping or running.
Probably won’t return to this place because of neighbor. Lucky for me I had to get up at that time anyways to go to the airport"

Stayed one night",This location was unfortunately subpar. It does not feel safe even though you are close to Fells Point. The place is across from a gas station and next door to a condemned building. When we arrived to check in there were men loitering on the sidewalk outside of the gate so we didn’t even stop. We went to dinner and actually planned to just go back home but decided to swing back by on our way out of town. When we went back the people were gone so we took our chances and stayed there. The room itself is okay but it wasn’t worth being in that area & having to worry about our car / who would be outside the gate in the morning - next time I’d get a hotel for the peace of mind. Hate to leave a bad review but I was fooled by all the positive reviews into thinking this was going to be a great place to stay and wished someone would have commented on how sketchy it is.

Little Italy is the next street over. Harbor/Fell's Point is a few lovely blocks away.
I was hoping there would be a fan to use, it was a little stuffy during the day...even with the AC on high. Also I couldn't figure out how to turn the heated floors on in the bathroom.
Oh and you can definitely hear people walking (sounded like stomping) above you, so if that bothers you.
Otherwise...clean & good location"

Stayed one night","My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night. It's good walking distance to a lot of local shops, and is fairly close to Fells Point, which we liked. For being on a busy street, the room we had was in the back across the patio, so we didn't hear any city noise which was great. You can however hear every footstep from above, which can be annoying (especially since my bf is a light sleeper). The place also seems to be battling ants, we killed 1-2 in bed, and the AC does not cool the place down enough. There is no TV, but WIFI, which was appreciated. The bed is also super comfortable. For what the place used to be it's a nice small, clean place to crash for a night if you need something in the city."

The bed is comfy and the WiFi is great. My biggest issues were the dampness of the space (there was a dehumidifier that was full when we arrived), the noisy upstairs neighbors, and it was very toasty! There is an AC unit, but I'm not sure it's super efficient against the hot nights of summer.
Overall, this is an affordable space in a great spot. Cute little shared courtyard, which I enjoyed."

And communication was easy and thorough. The space was nice and modern, and perfect for people looking to explore the city with a comfy spot to come back to. There were a couple points where the neighbors above were a bit loud, but it was rare and in no way anything to ruin the experience. We would (and just might) stay there again for how convenient and accessible it was."

Stayed a few nights","The location offered by Scott and Jen is simple and secluded a tender nook to escape some of the noise of the inner harbor and rest easy. We were able to interact with a lovely couple who were also staying under Jen and Scott. The room is modern and quaint a perfect place to unwind and disconnect after a long day exploring the sights and tastes the inner harbor has to offer and the many locations offered by our gracious hosts. The bathroom has a heated floor and was peaceful with a great shower. We did have a little bit of trouble with ants and a leak above the toilet. However, this is not a reflection of the comfort and sincerity for which Jen and Scott care for their residents. Jen was professionally and quickly responsive to any issue and I would be happy to stay with them anytime in the future."

The space was exactly as described in the pictures — I was actually impressed by the size of the bathroom and the laundry/storage room which did not come across in the photos. The studio was absolutely charming and really made me wistful/nostalgic for Baltimore (I wish I lived there when I was in the city!). The bed, couch, etc were all very comfy and well designed and prepared for the guest.
Lastly, John was incredibly thoughtful and proactive. When I asked for a possible luggage storage situation upon checkout, he really went out of his way to see if this was possible and called me as well. A+ service on top of being available by text regularly.
Thanks for a great stay and hope to be back soon!"

Check-in was easy, thanks to step by step instructions in the app that somehow very few hosts actually use. A parking spot is available but we were able to park on the street directly in front of the apartment. And we had our bikes with us and were able to take them off the car and store them in the (locked) stairwell. The decor of the apartment is so well thought out, with neat antique furniture mixed with contemporary pieces. The bed was incredibly comfortable - my husband slept a full two hours later than he does at home! And there were thoughtful touches throughout. We walked to a couple neighborhood bars and then a recommended cafe the next morning for breakfast - loved the places and the neighborhood. We don’t live far from Baltimore and totally take for granted that we can go anytime - and then we don’t! We can’t wait to come back soon and stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","Very comfortable and spacious apartment. One of the best beds ever - hands down. Wish all Airbnb listings took their beds seriously. Super soft and comfy. Amazing shower. On a main road, but no worries about that - the windows were nearly soundproof. I slept great. Kitchen is small but well-appointed and I had everything I needed and more. Wonderful that this host does not charge a cleaning fee - I wish more would offer that! Great location in town. I didn't get to explore much, as I was there for a seminar which lasted all day, but the apartment is in a great location - close to everything, but safe and quiet. Temperature was perfect - nice and warm. Loved the fireplace. Highly recommend. John is friendly and responsive."

Stayed one night","I wanted to avoid boring so this was the place for me - stylish, comfy, super clean, well thought out - had everything I needed and then some. The row house neighborhood in old Baltimore was great! I was charmed by the festive strings of lights most of the neighborhood had strung over the sidewalks from house to tree to house and again all down the blocks. It felt like a little party walking to a very nice restaurant 3 blocks away.
Street parking was easy arriving before 4pm, parked right in front of the door.
John’s communication was top notch - super responsive, proactive, everything about the stay was clear.
Stay here - you’ll enjoy it!"

It's an easy 40 min ish walk that gives you time to explore the neighborhoods. Autumn in Baltimore is soon beautiful! We loved being right next to Patterson Park. John was a communicative and clear.

He was always available, and responded right away. Most helpful though: we had a messed up transportation arrangement, and needed a place to store our luggage a whole day after AM check out. He helped us without charging a fee. we are thankful, his hospitality really made our trip sorry free.
The apartment was an amazing beautiful loft studio. Super clean. double shower was really cool. The bed was really big and comfy. We enjoyed evenings relaxing on the comfy couch watching some TV.
The kitchen looks small, but it's fully stocked. Even got some nice sparkling water for free.
Location is great, it's in a safe neighborhood, we can walk or bus to the harbor and art museum, etc
I loved the no cleaning fee feature. Personally I don't mind doing some light cleaning as an appreciation and respect for the host.
I highly recommend John's place!"

Stayed about a week","John is an absolute gem and Saint of a person. He was extremely accommodating for me as I was traveling to Baltimore for a surgery and didn’t have a date to be heading home yet so he allowed me to extend if I needed to. He was very kind and supportive as well.
The apartment itself was perfect! The stairs were a little steeper than I expected but doable. The shower was my favorite part (2 shower heads and a built in shower chair!) all the furniture was comfy and the whole place just immediately felt like home to us. The kitchen is perfect for basic meals and re-heating things and even had all the basic condiments. The coffee grinder was a life saver because we forgot ours! Oh also, go walk around Patterson Park it is across the street basically and beautiful!
Highly recommend John’s place. You will love it."

Stayed one night","Location was perfect for what I needed the fireplace was warm and inviting the kitchen was properly stocked with things I needed, Go to super sweet he had the Britta water filter a few beverages even a adult beverage waiting on me in the refrigerator I didn’t drink but that was very kind.
One piece of feedback I will add and this could just be particular to me because I’m not a custom to sleeping in the city I would flip the room arrangement around to have the bed at the other end of the room so that you were not on the street side with the noise. I got used to but it did take me a minute to fall asleep again could just be totally my experience and most people that live in the city or visit the city would not find this unusual it would not keep me from staying there again just some food for thought. Wonderful host and very Cozy bed;)"

From the moment I arrived, John was responsive to any questions I may of had to make sure I had a stress-free experience. The apartment itself was very stylish and modern, with all the amenities I could possibly need.
John was also very generous and kind when I accidentally left my watch in the apartment. He quickly contacted me to let me know he had found it and was willing to return it to me. I was so grateful for his thoughtfulness and kindness.
Overall, my stay at John’s apartment was an excellent experience. His hospitality, generosity, and attention to detail made the stay very enjoyable. I would highly recommend John’s apartment to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish place to stay."

restaurants, but there are some restaurants sparsely sprinkled very close by. John arranged for private parking but we hardly used it because street parking was generally available. Traffic street noise was a small drawback, otherwise wonderful in every other way. Great place to feel and live like a local."

Stayed one night","John's place in Baltimore is awesome!! First of all, I love the neighborhood. My cousins used to live nearby, so I've always loved this area, but wow, it's gotten so beautiful over the last few years.
Stayed here with a Girlfriend for a night out in Baltimore. The apartment was so great and comfortable. Parking super easy across the street. We had a glass of wine on the fabulous and very comfortable sofa with the fire going and music before we ubered to dinner in Fells Point...after which we had a lovely walk home, hitting some perfectly Baltimore dive on the way back.
The King bed was so comfortable and for two girls sharing...we had no notice of the other one in the bed...there was an extra blanket in the blanket box, so we each had our own. So many lovely touches like this made it such a perfect stay...tons of amenities in the little kitchenette as well.
We walked a couple blocks to a cute coffee place in the morning and then walked with our coffees in Patterson Park....just a glorious and perfect stay. Thanks John!"

Stayed a few nights","John’s place is incredible. I think the pictures don’t really do it justice… it is very nice, clean, and cozy. 😁
I had a little trouble opening the lock box at first— but probably because I never used a lock box before 🙃 just have to push the button in and slide down the small door first, then put in the combination, then push down the little lever to open the whole thing. I was just confused… & this is a heads up for anyone who plans to stay here.
Other than that, this place was PERFECT for the incredible weekend I had. The fire is remote controlled, so I was able to go to bed with the fire still going and then turn it down/off from the bed. 😊 The lighting is amazing— most of the lights have dimmers so you can create your own ambience. Then there’s a surround sound system— I was blasting Christmas music while I got ready for the events I had. 😁🎄🎶 the bathroom was nice & clean and stocked with shampoo, soap, tp, towels… anything you could need. There’s even a laundry room with a washer & dryer— I was able to do some laundry :) so convenient!!
Oh, AND, it’s very close to so many shops, restaurants, Fells Point Harbor… all of it. Great location!! I had a wedding by the harbor and it took less than 10 minutes to get there.
5 stars all across the board, 10/10 would recommend, def will book again the next time I go to Baltimore. :)"

It was the perfect location. The rental is on the second floor so you will have to climb some stairs. Once there you’ll find a charming environment with ambient lighting and wonderful architecture. The rental is large and very well equipped and the king bed was the most comfortable we’ve had in an Airbnb. John was super nice and very responsive. We plan to go back for a more fun occasion. Great value, highly recommend."

You can easily drive or Uber anywhere in the city and can walk to Fells, Canton, etc. The kitchen is well appointed and stocked. The shower is luxurious. The bed is blissful. The design is hip.
