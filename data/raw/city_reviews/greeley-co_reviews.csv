Stayed one night","Thank you! I really enjoyed staying in a beautiful place in a historical town. One downside is the wifi is sometimes slow and you can hear people from other rooms, but it didn’t bother me very much. The bathroom was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I’m willing to stay here again"

Stayed one night","I overall loved this room, just that there was alot of banging above us that started at like 6 a.m and so it woke us up and we were not able to get back to sleep so we just got up and left. Also not a super bad thing or anything but our TV remote didn't work, we figured the batteries were probably dead but it's ok we just left the TV off. Other then that the room was nice and clean."

They have little baked goods and drinks run on an honor system of paying cash or digital payment. Lafayette Creperie is inside of the B&B, although I didn’t get a chance to try it because of the event I had to get to so early in the morning. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb certainly was a great value for visiting friends & family in Greeley & taking advantage of all that surrounds the area including Rocky Mountain Nat’l Park, Loveland, Fort Collins and Boulder! I didn’t get to try the breakfast spot but was happy to have a frig, coffee maker & coffee & microwave in room! Big bathroom. Shower door could use repair. Not fancy but cozy and comfortable. Window AC prevented opening window for fresh air.
I’d recommend this Airbnb to anybody on a budget that needs a quiet place to sleep within walking distance to downtown Greeley. I even discovered a cute French bakery a couple of blocks away!"

Stayed one night","This is a charming hotel with a great location. It was the perfect place to stay for my one night visit. The porch/veranda circling the hotel was a great spot to relax in the shade after a long, hot day. I loved the antique decor and the historical information about the many individuals the rooms are named after.
I would give this place a full 5 star rating except for two glitches. When I got out of the shower with wet hair, I could not get the hair drier to work. Luckily, it's summer in Colorado, so everything dries fast. Also, no glasses or cups were in the room even though there were cup lids, coffee and a coffee maker. So I just went downstairs to the main level where there was a gorgeous old cabinet filled with glassware and helped myself to one off the glasses in there.
I would definitely stay there again."

Stayed over a week","I was here for several days while I was attending a summer program at UNC, which is close by. It is a comfortable stay and I appreciated the downstairs area is mostly empty at night so it's like an extra wide open study area. I also made use of the huge lovely wrap around porch with rocking chairs. Being able to have breakfast in the morning (with a 20% hotel discount) is a plus! One thing to note--the picture doesn't show it, but the room now has a mini-refrigerator, microwave and a coffee maker which I was grateful to have since I was staying long-term. The co-host, Marcus, was always nice and helpful when I need a restock on supplies. I'd stay here again!"

Truly, very clean, but with the wear and tear you would expect for an old hotel! (I personally found it all very charming.) I would stay again in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","The Currier Inn and the Boyd Room were both amazing! We loved the atmosphere and the coziness of the room. The location was also amazing, its a walking distance to almost everything you could need. We were afraid that since it was an old building that noise would be an issue, but we never heard the other guests. The inside of the building is also gorgeous.
There are a couple of ""negatives"" one of which isn't a negative, but something to clarify. This BnB used to actually have a full complimentary breakfast. The Inn was taken over by new management in May and they no longer offer this. This isn't a deal breaker for me as I always overslept breakfast anyway, but for anyone who reads past reviews and sees that breakfast is offered, know that it isn't. The only real negative I have is that since this property was acquired recently there is some work being done on it currently. We experience hammering as early as 9:30 AM all the way up to 2:00 PM. I don't expect this to last long, but it was a nuisance to me, as I said above, I like to sleep in.
I would totally recommend staying here and plan on staying here again myself!"

The front porch was perfect for my studying, and my husband was happy about the cable options. We stayed in Boyd for two nights, and had to extend our stay for a third night, Steve accommodated us in Shawsheen. Both rooms were unique and beautiful. Everything worked perfectly, we had everything we needed. I have never been to Greeley before this, and Steve’s place made it feel like home."

From the great parking & big garage to the jacuzzi jetted-tub to the fantastic record player, it was everything we needed, PLUS an assortment of extras like a washer and dryer, several teas, an abundance of space and work stations, a great grill, dreamy-cozy beds, cotton sheets, perfect pillows, and excellent, immediate communication. The notes were good, helpful instructions for things like the classic record player and where to find towels and extra pillows. Both of us said to each other “this would be sweet to come back to for non-work relaxation.” 100%+ recommend."

We were travelling with our two dogs and were delighted to find that not only do Dave and Stacy allow dogs, but the dogs were included in the welcome message.
When we walked into the house there was a message on the blackboard saying, ""Welcome Patricia, guest and pups"". They also left a special treat container with doggie treats. We felt very welcome.
The house included everything that was shown and more. The neighbors are super friendly and helpful too.
Next time we come to Colorado we plan to get with Stacy and Dave and stay here again.
I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a convenient, quiet place to stay."

We came into town suddenly and they were able to accommodate our needs. I only wish I could spend more time at this Airbnb and just relax because it’s fully equipped to do just that.
It was very clean and comfortable and close to everything.

Stacy was an excellent communicator and gave us very quick responses to any questions we posed. Instructions were carefully posted. All furnishings were top notch. I don't think the photos do the home justice. Yes, the home is great for families with children, (the loft bedroom would be great fun) but we also found it a lovely and romantic stay during our 43rd anniversary week. The stereo and nice collection of vinyl added to the whole package."

I’ve never stayed at an Airbnb where someone took as much time to make you feel welcome. As far as space goes, our family of 6 had more than enough and that’s saying a lot! Big bonus that they let you use the garage! Most places you stay always tell you the garage is off limits, not this one!! The big deal for me, communication. Stacy and her husband communicated often and effectively. I can’t say enough positive things about this listing, so all I can say is…. stay here, it’s worth your time and money."

Nice to have a garage, although it wasn't used, in case of severe weather which had been threatening but never arrived. Pleasant interactions with Stacy. Highly recommended."

We look forward to staying here again!!! Until next time

Stayed a few nights","This was a great little house for our group. Our group of four was quite comfortable.
The house was as advertised.
The hosts were great communicators. They went out of their way to make our stay nice. Well-organized guest handbook with a wealth of helpful information.
The weather was unseasonably hot, but the window unit air conditioners did a pretty good job of keeping the house cool. Well stocked with Considerate touches throughout. Very clean. Full garage for parking a vehicle.
The location is great for visiting UNCO.
A very good value, with no unreasonable added fees or demands.
Absolutely hoping to stay here again in the future."

The area was so peaceful and quiet during the night.
I got to meet the hosts and they were so sweet, they are landscaping so they let us know they would be coming over for a second to water the plants.
Stacy was very responsive and answered promptly. I would recommend this stay."

We came to Greeley for the night from Denver for a soccer tournament and I told my wife that I preferred to stay in a hotel because I thought all of the AirBNB options would be disappointing. Fortunately, she persuaded me otherwise. As soon as I walked in the front door, I was blown away at every aspect of this apartment. The modern design, incredible sunlight, historic architecture, cleanliness, walkability....the list goes on an on. You would think you had just rented an apartment in Brooklyn....not Greeley. Cute coffeeshop on the lower level. Amazing french bakery down the block. Everything within walking distance. Seriously, we may do a weekend in Greeley just to stay in this apartment again. Stay here. You won't be disappointed."

Beds are comfortable, amenities were great -- we weren't there long enough to really utilize the kitchen, but it is well equipped with nice dishware/knives/glasses, etc. It is clearly an older building - the floors are very creaky and there is no elevator, so if stairs are an issue, then this isn't the place for you. But, the coffee shop below and the French bakery just down a few doors, are outstanding! I had some mostly user-error issues when getting into the unit, and Brad was extremely responsive to my text message, called me right away and got me straightened out. I would definitely recommend Brad & Christa as hosts!"

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay at Mark's place. The set up of the house is fantastic. It's a beautiful home, and the neighborhood is so quiet and peaceful at night. The rooms are big and beds are comfy. In the ad they say they have 2 dogs, but I can honestly say we never heard them not one time. lots of pots and pans and a nice roomy kitchen. I recommend their home to anyone looking for a quiet, comfy family stay."

Stayed about a week","This was a lovely home away from home for my son and me. Great location close to the UNC campus, and I love the neighborhood – took lots of walks around Glenwood Park. The hosts are very responsive and accommodating; I had made a special request which they were willing to accommodate, and when there was an issue, the response was immediate.
The house is very nicely remodeled, with safe parking on the street - no surprises, it looks just like the photos. The beds are comfortable, nice kitchen, living room area, and outdoor patio. And the air conditioner was great. It could use a few more fixes in the kitchen (anchor the dishwasher, hot-water pressure), and ventilation in the bathroom to prevent mildew.
The hosts live on-site, but the way the home is divided, it is private and works really well with no shared spaces. I worked from home, using the desk in one of the bedrooms. I stayed for over a week and had everything I needed.
Thank you!"

Great to have a full kitchen and a yard as well. I would definitely look to stay here again when I'm back visiting this area.
The home is in a very nice neighborhood, I really enjoyed walking around the lake in the park which is right around the corner. The park will appeal to fellow bird lovers. I was surprised to find families of cormorants living there, a great blue heron wading and 3 white pelicans floating peacefully around the lake. There's a fun playground for families at the park as well."

Stayed a few nights","Generally an awesome place. Loved the old small town building feel of the place. We found instructions and parking very easy and the managers very easy to work with. Functional and well laid out. The heater is loud but its part of the old town building feel and didn't bother us. During the day you can slightly hear music from the Restaurant below but we did not find that an issue at all. I would have preferred curtains that are not see through to block the morning sun and for privacy.
Loved the nostalgic feel of the building and for us the perfect location. We'd be very happy to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","First of all, Brad was super helpful and very quick to respond to all of our questions. Not only that he was extremely considerate towards us and we appreciate his communication and kindness. Due to his action, I would feel comfortable working with him again.
However, there seemed to be some kind of miscommunication with the building manager and cleaner when we first arrived and the apartment was dirty and we ultimately did not end up staying there as planned. This did not seem to be Brad’s fault and as I said, he was extremely helpful in getting the situation resolved and quick to issue a refund and even covered our hotel stay.
Overall the space was very cute and if it were not for our initial impression we would have really enjoyed staying there! I think we just had a bit of bad luck, but I really can’t stress enough how helpful Brad was."

We were awoken at 1am by loud noises that sounded like our door opening but no one was there. Also keep hearing a thumping noise from in the loft that sounded like an ice machine but the fridge doesn’t have one? Suddenly heard a clock ticking really loud then just stopped? Kinda spooky especially because it’s an old building. Overall nice but noises are scary- and we’re not light sleepers or believers in ghosts…

I could have spent a lot more time there.
we had our 4yo with us during this stay. I spent a lot of energy worrying about how much noise she was making, or telling her to not touch something. I wouldn't suggest this loft for travelers with a small child."

The original property we booked had issues with its AC which made the temperature uncomfortable. So in response to this, Brad and Christa spent much of the day prior to us arriving trying to make the temperature as comfortable as possible. When this issue came up, They communicated everything to us and assured us that if the temperature was too uncomfortable that he would move us to another property of theirs closeby with no additional charge. Brad and Christa's impeccable communication when navigating this complication as well as their genuine hospitality made them more than superhosts!!"

Stayed a few nights","I gave this listing 3 stars because:
First of all it is a beautiful, spacious and clean apartment. It looks like something out of a magazine. Brad was very responsive to texts and phone calls. It was also fun to have a coffee shop downstairs and the building itself was quiet. If this was all there was to our stay, I would have given it 5 stars but...
the furnace and air conditioner are mounted on the ceiling close to the bedroom with no sound deafening whatsoever. Trying to sleep was like trying to sleep beside a 747 taking off. Also, it does not work well so the coil froze up and we had a night with no AC. Brad was very quick to respond but that didn't decrease the noise at all.
Secondly, keep in mind that it is an apartment and there are 2 flights of steps to climb up and down so be prepared to haul luggage and your tired self up those stairs.
Finally, the parking spot is safe for your car but to get out, you have to back out of an alley and back out onto a busy city street.
I wish that I could of rated this higher as Brad is a really nice guy but..."

The glowing reviews on their loft apartment are all true: bright, spacious loft-style apartment, exceptionally clean, very fast and stable Wi-Fi, great furnishings and style. Everything that could possibly have been done to make our family of four comfortable for our two-night stay was taken care of, and our hosts were careful to check in occasionally to see if there was anything we needed. But there wasn't! Everything had been thought of ahead of time. We slept very comfortably and really felt as though the loft was our home away from home during our time in Greeley."

The kitchen was well stocked and made it easy for us to cook. The location and the vibe was great! My daughter slept on one of the roll away beds that were provided. The only flaw for us is that the ceiling furnace unit is fairly noisy especially for someone like me that is a light sleeper. A pair of earplugs would probably help with that. A bonus was how communicative and responsive Brad & Christa were. A plus on customer service!

This place is most definitely a great spot for couples and adventure seekers. The apartment was nicely cleaned and is very spacious.
The loft and the apartment are great outdoors environments for a stay in the lush area. The apartment is in a loft building where you will stay in a comfortable and fixed up apartment decorated with a comfortable but very jazzy vibe and in an outdoors feel away from the cities.
I stayed during the summer where everything was very relaxing and calm. I believe this would also be amazing in the winter, especially after being outdoors all day. I would recommend this place as an experience in the countryside of the mountains."

They had almost everything at the loft we only had to bring ourselves,luggage and food to cook. I appreciate that they informed us of the entry way, that really shouldn't discourage anyone from renting this place. Once you see the inside you can see past how the outside looks. we had a good amount of privacy I will definitely be coming back to this place! again thank you for hosting my husband and I we had such a lovely time at your loft and in Colorado!"

Stayed with kids","It was a true pleasure to stay at Brad & Christa’s loft for a week! The listing photos are completely accurate. It is a beautifully updated and decorated unit in a charming historical building. You’re next door to a great local coffee shop (the loft’s wonderful balcony directly overlooks their twinkle-lighted back garden) and walking distance to many restaurants. Do yourself a favor and go around the corner to the amazing French bakery! The building is across the street from the UNC campus, a perfect base to visit a student if you have one. That being said, we had no issues with any neighborhood noise. We felt like we were on the best corner to hang out on in Greeley.
The unit is very well equipped, especially the kitchen. The hosts have thought of, and provided, everything you will need. We utilized the two rollaway beds pushed together for our young daughter and they worked great. There was plenty of room in the living area for both. The main bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the blackout curtains in the bedroom.
There is a dedicated parking spot in the back which was great. (Yes, near the dumpster, but this was a non-issue for us). Be aware if you have significant mobility issues that the apartment is up two short flights of stairs.
Communication with the hosts was great and we would happily book the loft again."

Stayed with kids","we booked this location for our Rocky Mountain vacation in August. we will say the Hosts are very nice and reply quickly when we have any issues. the main problems are the location and equipment of apartment itself. it is a kind of old apartment on the 2nd floor above some commercial units, such as tattoo bar and restaurant. we arrived on Friday, and unfortunately, that night is a disaster with pretty loud music sound and singing until 4 am. But, it was not such bad thereafter on Saturday and Sunday. The hardware in the apartment is good and it is clean. however, the outside is indeed not very welcome. the parking lot is near to the waste bin, and the building entrance and stairs are dirty. the most unhappy part is the AC. it is very loud, almost unacceptable during night. so we have to stop it before going to the bed. however, it stopped work on Sunday and was not able to lower the temperature. it reached 83F before we went to bed. it was bad experience for those two nights."

Amy is very communicative and even invited us to tour the upper level of this historic house along with a complimentary beer! We would definitely stay at her place again while visiting Greeley and would highly recommend it to others."

Stayed one night","Came up to visit our daughter at UNC. Very close, 5 minute drive from her dorm. Beautifully decorated, clean, comfy and roomy. Park on street in front or back alley. Well lit, security cameras, door key pad and internal alarm system. You're in the basement with upper windows. They use the upstairs for events and games. Amy lets you know what's going on at the house. What to expect. Private entrance. No one was there for the night we stayed.
Kitchen has microwave, sink, mini-fridge, beverage cooler, plenty of utensils and such. King bed in one room, queen in another. Large TV sitting area with lots of channels/streaming. Small bathroom with shower, plenty of hot water.
1889 historic home, across the street from the Greeley High School. Plenty of restaurants nearby. We love Pinocchio's. Doubletree and their restaurant couple blocks over. Natural Grocer nearby.
Amy's very helpful for what you need. Fun place; interesting sprinkler. We'll be back to stay and play!"

It’s super cute and comfortable and a nice quiet spot for us to take a break from all the peopleing. Added bonus it’s close to bars and restaurants, a liquor store, and a peaceful park across the street. It had everything we needed including cozy throws for relaxing on the couch and watching Netflix, which we never have time for at home. I would 100% recommend it to other folks with similar needs. And Amy is friendly and available for any assistance you might need. Know that it is a few steps down to the Suite and may not be the best place for someone who needs ambulatory assistance. Thanks Amy! It was just perfect!"

My admiration is such that I've taken lots of photos to guide me when I get to finishing my basement, I never thought one could be so wonderful to look at and live in. A happy place.

Amy met us on property when we arrived and was so friendly. She gave us local recommendations (The Stampede Rodeo was a highlight) and a lay of the land. We had contact a few times during our stay and she was always quick to respond and very helpful. If ever back in the area this is exactly where we will stay!"

The walls are paper thin so you can hear every outside sound and the basement neighbors as well as the dogs that live on either side of the house. Mostly the house was clean. Except for the kitchen counters which had dried coffee and such on them. our biggest concern was the dishes. Every cup in the cabinet had dried coffee, food, lip stains and finger prints. Most of the silverware was dirty and several of the plates had food on them. We did let the homeowner know as I’m guessing this is a cleaning company issue and not an owner issue. The owners were responsive to questions and allowed us to check in a bit early which was very helpful. Greeley is a cute city with lots of Art and good food. We will for sure visit again."

The host was the speediest responder I’ve ever experienced - which was truly impressive! We grew to be quite fond of the vintage bungalow with the beautiful butterfly garden front yard. The only thing we would have changed - more linens and towels, please."

Be sure to pull the door closed tightly and double check that it closed properly after pushing the lock button. The host is very specific about controls (thermostat, TV, dishwasher) but flexible when explicitly asked to make an adjustment.
There is a downstairs apartment and if there are tenants while you are there then quiet quickly becomes a luxury. As it is an older home, it can sound like they are in the same space as you are."

Upon arrival I had a question for him and Jerry appeared within minutes as he lives close by. We highly recommend the Cozy Craftsman!"

It was easy to access, close to the event I was in town for, comfortable, and had all the things one needs to feel at home. It was also quiet. I am thankful Seth allowed me to bring my dog, as it was really perfect for the two of us. I will say my dog’s paws are on the smaller side so I had to carry him up and down the stairs due to the stairs being metal grating. I didn’t find it to be a problem and it wouldn’t stop me from renting the place again. If ever I’m in Greeley again I will see if this place is available before looking anywhere else."

Stayed over a week","We lived there for two months while our house is being remodeled and enjoyed it very much. Supplies were generous and we didn't have to shop for tp, paper towels, cleaning products, and so on. Pots, pans, dishes, cutlery were quality, as was everything else.
On the upper floor, there were quite a few stairs to walk up, which I appreciated for exercise after eating at so many close-by restaurants! It really is close to local entertainment, restaurants, and shops.
I'd read in another review that employees of the management company in the building were not always mindful of their volume while speaking outside and allowed doors to slam--I'd been concerned about that, but we never had that happen during our two months there.
We were sad to leave but other reservations had been made while we were staying there and it was not always available during the following months; if I'd known we were going to be out of our house for so long, I would have made our initial reservation for longer."

Stayed a few nights","This private studio-apartment was accommodating. Located in downtown Greeley, you have walking distance access to dining, and many other options are just a short drive away. The space itself was kept clean and organized. It is attached to what seems like some kind of management office, and if I were to make any negative commentary about my stay, it was that the employees were not always mindful of their volume while speaking outside or allowing doors to slam. This became a bit aggravating when trying to relax in the space. Aside from that, communication was simple, check in/out was easy, and the space provided for my needs."

The apartment is a short walk to an excellent pizza spot and the Nerd shop (Game store). There was an assortment of teas and coffees but we also enjoyed the local coffee shops. The location is close proximity to Windsor/Loveland/Fort Collins. We were even able to do a load of laundry! All around a phenomenal stay!

We were 1/2 block from the park hosting a craft/art show and a block from the neat little downtown. It was a nice location to be part of Greeley downtown and a great jumping off location for day trips.
There is a homeless population, which was not a problem for us. We got stopped by a gentleman one time who appeared to be homeless and had some questions. He was harmless.
Just a heads up you might see this.
I would recommend this place to anyone that likes to be near where things are happening. Yummy restaurants, fun stores, and local breweries all in walking distance.
The kitchen was great and well supplied with cooking needs."

My fiancé and I enjoyed morning coffee on the patio and movie nights by the fire were a hit. Having the garage made entering the home and securing our vehicles a breeze. This is also the ONLY stay that I’ve encountered that charges a cleaning fee and does NOT assign duties to be done before check out (although we still do our own clean because that’s how we were raised, it’s nice to not have the pressure of getting everything done). I would stay here again any time!"

If you are traveling with kids there is a neighborhood park directly across the street from the townhome! The house comes fully furnished with your standard hotel room supplies.

Stayed about a week","Absolutely LOVED our stay in the Evans/Greeley townhouse. Ana has thought of everything to make your stay like home.
-The beds were very comfortable
-the townhouse was extremely clean
- there are dishes, cookware, a toaster oven, and the stove is also an airfryer!
-this is a new home with garage parking
- shampoo, conditioner, body wash, laundry supplies, etc are
all provided
-wonderful patio sitting area with a grill(we didnt use, but it was nice to know it was there should we want to)
- Ana even provided snacks, coffee , and tea choices
- limited mountain view, but centrally located to get to all the hot spots in Colorado. 2 hours to Rocky Mountain Nat Park, 40 minutes to Fort Collins, an hour or so to Denver or Colorado Springs(Pikes Peak), 2.5 hours to Mt Evans, 1.5 hours to Estes Park via Loveland.
The drive through the Loveland Canyon Pass to Estes is heavenly. We did it 3 times during our week stay. Even saw a bear on our drive through!
-pet friendly! We were able to bring our yorkie and chihuahua with us on vacation without exorbitant pet fees!
Ana checked in with us during our stay just to make sure all was good and see if anything was needed.
Honestly, you cant go wrong staying in this home!"

Stayed with kids","We were in town for a volleyball tournament, and could not have found a better place to stay! Besides being clean and appearing to be a brand new townhouse, everything we needed was there. The beds were very comfortable. This was one time we actually didn’t miss our bed at home! The bathrooms were stocked with everything you may need, from shampoo and conditioner to toothbrushes and toothpaste. The kitchen was very well stocked with everything you’d need. I was very impressed! If you want a beautiful, comfortable place to stay this is it!"

Stayed with kids","What a great, beautifully decorated townhouse we stayed at January 15th–17th!! It was easy to find given the directions that was sent to us! We appreciated all the toys, games and books that were available for our 2 1/2 year-old granddaughter! We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Greeley!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is AMAZING! Not only is it beautiful ,but squeaky clean. House is equipped with everything you could need and more. It is in a great location where we felt very safe. It's at walking distance from shopping/restaurants. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to family/friends. Thanks Pyper!❤️"
