Stayed a few nights","I was so happy I came across this gem of a place when looking for a place to stay while visiting my sister in Tennessee. The cottage was lovely, clean and had the every thing we needed during our stay . We felt at home. This was our first Air bnb stay and we will definitely look at a Abnb next time we travel. Our host, Brittany always responded quickly to any questions and request. If we find ourselves traveling near Dayton Tennessee again . I would love to stay here again.
Thank You Brittany and Jake."

They have made such great use of their space. My very favorite is the front porch. We love walking actions the street for dinner and down the street for coffee. We can’t wait to come back. Thank you for everything!!

This place also has plenty of space for a family or in our case a group of friends. It was walkable to a Monkey town brewing and restaurant which was a nice place to get a bite of food and relax."

Stayed a few nights","Brittany was awesome! And Trinity cottage is awesome!
We come every year so my wife can photograph the Sandhill cranes. Unfortunately, this year a winter storm came blanketing the roads with snow & ice on the dates we had booked. Brittany was fantastic in working with us in these circumstances out of our control.
I HIGHLY recommend Brittany & Trinity Cottage. When we are planning a trip to Dayton we will shift our plans to make sure we can stay at Trinity - the only place to stay in Dayton, TN!"

Stayed with kids","My family and I were in Dayton to visit family for Christmas, and this cottage suited our group of 6 perfectly. It’s in a quiet downtown area, and had tons of space inside and out that allowed for an even greater experience of peace and privacy. Everything was very clean, well-stocked, maintained, and the furniture was comfortable and clean. We’ve stayed at other AirBNBs within a 10-mile radius of here, and this is one is by far the best and most family friendly. Brittany personally made sure that we were happy with our stay and went above and beyond to accommodate us, and that’s worth more than the rest. If it’s available next Christmas, we will certainly be back."

Stayed with kids","This was our second stay at Trinity Cottage. My family loves this place. It truly feels like home.
Brittany was super responsive and kind. She even invited us over to the chapel so my little boy could take a look at the Christmas decorations.
It is fairly child-friendly (I have a 4 year old and a 1 year old). I put up a portable baby gate for the stairs to keep my one year old from climbing up.
It’s also a great location. Walking distance from Harmony House coffee house and just across the road from a really good pizza place.
A very comfortable stay, and I would highly recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","Brittany accommodated our 700 mile by motorcycle travel schedule and helped us gain entry just as soon as we arrived. The entire place, inside and outside was well kept and organized. Little extras like coffee, creamer and snacks made us feel right at home as soon as we entered. We stayed for a week and the grass was always mowed. All linens, pillows, bathrooms and kitchen were clean and organized with everything a long road trip traveler may ever need upon arrival. So much better than a hotel where stop 1 is unpacking, stop 2 is to the store to get necessities. At Brittany’s Airbnb, no need for a 2nd stop as there is everything you need upon arrival. All appliances worked and were in great condition. TV (so much to do down there, we didn’t watch much), and Wi-Fi worked seamlessly. Our trip was for 2 however the cottage could easily a accommodate a larger family and bonus, cook in and save the expense of eating out. Brittany’s cottage is an excellent value! We’ll be back!"

There are multiple little touches that make the cottage feel special, from the thoughtful decor to the books and games on the upstairs shelf (and everything in between). There were plenty of towels in each of the three bathrooms and the hot water never ran out! My children and I loved every minute we spent in this charming, comfortable, and beautiful cottage!"

Location was great.
Check in & out was simple & awesome.
Communication was great.
Local recommendations were also greatly appreciated before arrival.
Place was everything we needed to bring 2 boats & 2 trucks with 4 adults.
Clean, roomy, wifi, everything worked as you’d hope once inside or outside.
Front porch & back porch were also relaxing to sit & talk outside.
Provided downstairs gfci plugs for charging boat batteries between fishing trips at Chickamauga.
Would easily re-book for our next trip to that lake.
Thanks again Katie."

On cloudless nights it is dark enough to see the stars. We are nature lovers and there is plenty to do around the area. Pocket wilderness is just a short drive away and was perfect for our 15 month old to walk. The house also has a bunch of games which we totally took advantage of and had a blast doing so. It really felt like we were at home.
Katie had great recommendations and was super responsive. We would definitely stay here again."

Group trip","Our family traveled to Dayton, TN for our daughter's graduation from a local college. I found Katie's place and booked it immediately in January. Katie promptly responded to my booking. The day prior to our arrival Katie provided detailed information about check-in, local places to eat, as well as an additional contact in case we need it.
The property itself is absolutely amazing and the pictures do not do it justice. It is serene and quiet with great views of the mountains. The residence is nicely decorated with modern appliances and comfortable furniture. The covered porch off the living room was incredible and made morning coffee taste that much better.
When it came time for checkout, Katie texted instructions that made checkout a breeze. If and when I return to Dayton, I will definitely book Katie's home again. Our stay was flawless, and it truly was a home away from home! I highly recommend this location!"

It would be a great place for fishermen as well, lots of parking room on a private drive, so everything is secure. Only a 10 min drive to either end of town via a back way with no stop lights! House looks exactly like the pics with high quality bedding and towels. All you need to get started is provided. We’ll be back to stay again for sure!"

There is a relaxing atmosphere that feels like you're in the Smokey Mountains somewhere. Lots of space to enjoy the indoors with two living room areas. And it was really hard to decide which outdoor space we loved more, the upstairs front deck or the back patio. We spent lots of time on both just taking in the trees and mountain scenery. It was everything we expected, highly recommend."

The location was quiet and right next to green woods, but it was only a short drive into town.

The pictures didn’t even do it justice. We travel a lot and have stayed in a lot of places, and I would rate this the absolute cleanest property we have ever stayed at. The furnishings were both stylish and comfortable. We saw deer in the yard from the big living room window. We only cooked once, but the kitchen was fully stocked which made it easy.
Also, the lovely hosts left small toiletries, snacks, coffee and water which came in really handy and was such a thoughtful touch. We arrived after dark, and they had even left a light on for us!
This property is clearly one in which the hosts are focused on client comfort and satisfaction. I wish all hosts were this on top of things!

Stayed over a week","Fantastic stay at Gina’s place. We were in town for a large fishing tournament out of Dayton Boat Dock. This place is quite literally a stone throw away from the dock, only a couple miles away. There is also a huge tackle shop near the boat dock. This unit is brand new and you can truly see all the details and time that went into perfecting this air bnb. We were so pleased with everything about our stay. They even moved their cars on the lawn so we could park our rental car in the driveway. There is also a huge concrete slab separate for boats. Lastly it is very easy to check in with a key code entry as well as a large bright spot light at the entrance so when you pull in it lights the whole area up. Nice quiet neighborhood as well 👍🏻"

Lots of seating and sleeping space. No TV in the bedrooms, and no coffee. The ice maker doesn'twork. But the kitchen is large and would be easy to work in. Overall, a nice place to visit. If you have a large group, you'll probably enjoy all the space here."

Stayed with a pet","This home is exactly what we needed at the time we needed it. We have much loved pets, and we were forced out of our home due to a house fire. As an owner of a beach condo that I AirBnB, the fact that she allowed our furry friends (I don’t) sealed the deal. We left a few days early, and the owner held us to the full two weeks that we reserved it for on AirBnB. Keep that in mind if you decide to stay here. You will likely pay for the entire stay, even if something pops up and you need to leave early. Those are her rules.
Bottom line…if you need a place to stay with pets, this one may work well for you. It did for us. The view is nice!"

Stayed with kids","This home is very spacious and open. The pictures don't convey how much room there really is. Ulyana was a great host and very prompt in answering the questions we had before and during our stay. The view was beautiful. We had six in our group with my elderly parents using the master bedroom and bath. The Jack and Jill bathroom sandwiched between the other bedrooms was a little tricky as once those in the rooms went to bed, others would need to tiptoe through to use the bathroom. Also, the entrance from the driveway is up many wooden stairs (17) and may be difficult for some. But overall, the house was lovely and provided plenty of space for each family member to spread out and do their own thing. Thanks, Ulyana."

Stayed with a pet","The property is beautiful and the views are out of this world spectacular. Ulyana had impeccable response times. The bedrooms were gorgeous and comfortable. There were towels and extra sheets supplied. Checking in and out was a breeze. The home has a large amount of comfortable seating and a large table for dining with a beautiful view of Lake Chickamauga. Just a few important things to know: There are many loose dogs (who approach) in the neighborhood which isn't ideal for those traveling with dogs. It would be helpful to state this openly to prepare people for the dogs that come running up to your car. The entry points of the home are steep and not easy for older folks to navigate as easily, just a heads up for those traveling with limited mobility. The backyard is right up against the cliff ledge so you can not walk down to the water's edge, the images made it seem like you could. The yard is on the side of the home, not behind it, and has a relatively steep slant. The lower-floor back porch butts right up to the cliff edge and is not ""finished"" so it's not ideal for pets and small kids. Sliding glass doors had some gapping that let in bugs in the evenings which was not ideal. The dryer was also not working and had wet clothes still in it. Overall the home is beautiful and we had an amazing vacation."

Neighborhood is nice and is close to Zombies ice cream and other shopping nearby. We plan to stay here again in the future. House is pet friendly and to keep this wonderful option open, please leave as nice as found. Just for awareness, there is some leveling in the floors (the house is on hill), but nothing to worry about."

The home had a smell of sewage during our stay that was stronger in the bedroom areas but less so in the main living area. She did not offer any price adjustments for this. Otherwise it is a lovely home. The view is affected this time of the year as they drain the water below.

Dirty bathrooms, bedrooms and food left in fridge. I told Ulyna who did apologize and I told her we were leaving and ask for a full refund. As we left she called me back and said her cleaning girl can come now and we could wait. This house is big and we were not in the mood to be sitting around while someone cleans. Keep in mind the entire house has to be cleaned and that would not be a quick clean. She said she would have Airbnb refund my money but 2 weeks later nothing. Ulyna has washed her hands of this and told me to call Airbnb to find out what’s going on with my refund. At this point I just filed a dispute with my bank."

My favorite room was the sun room - I spent my mornings in that room reading my book and looking at the amazing view. I brought both of my dogs which was nice because they love traveling with us. However, I wish I had known the neighborhood dogs roam free on the street. I took my dog for a walk but had to run back to the house because my dog is aggressive and as soon as it saw the other dogs off their leashes coming toward us he freaked out. Still, no complaints just thought others should be aware! I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed about a week","What a great house and a great view with my morning coffee! This was our pet-friendly home over the Christmas holiday, and we could not have asked for a more comfortable stay. Plenty of space for myself and two teens. They also set up a small Christmas tree which was such a nice touch. Thank you! Be sure to check out the Laurel-Snow Cumberland Trail which is only 15 mins down the road. Chattanooga was only a short and scenic 40 minute drive. We will always stay here when in the area."

Three different living areas, large kitchen equipped with about anything you could think of. Thoughtful extras like board games, high chair, a few kids toys, gigantic TV, fast WiFi. Large main floor laundry. Clean and well stocked with towels, etc. Two minor things -- very steep driveway, and bathrooms are situated one in the master and the second a jack-and-jill arrangement between the other two bedrooms, so a little awkward if you are hosting guests or a party. Overall though, we loved it and would definitely come back."

The local towns were easily accessible, we went to visit family on Lake Chickamauga at his AirBnb and had a great time. Another family member lives in Soddy Daisy TN. Visited there also, had a fun hike at Soddy Daisy Big Gulf - highly recommend this.

Stayed about a week","Sometimes properties don't quite live up to the listing or pics. The Loft exceeds, packing a lot of value into a relatively small space.
We drove from TX for a week of kayak/wade fishing. The Loft was perfect for the two of us. Plenty of room for us and gear (but no wasted space) and a convenient, safe parking spot. Very clean and neat, with every amenity we needed, including washer/dryer and wi-fi. The bed is comfortably firm with good linens/covers. The ac/heater unit above the bed allowed complete tuning of the space's environment and provided ideal white noise. There's storage and hanging space for clothing, etc.
The view from the deck is relaxing, including the henhouse where the fresh eggs in your fridge are produced. Plenty of water, snacks and coffee.
Heather is the consummate host, providing clear, concise instructions for check-in/out. Very responsive but leaves you alone aside from a few good pro-active notices. We plan to stay again our next trip to east TN."

The loft is very cozy and felt like home away from home. The provided snacks, water & coffee was an added bonus. I highly recommend the loft.

We watched and listened to the chickens and she even shared their eggs. Even their cat was friendly! Would definitely stay there again. I miss it! Any activity she mentioned having, she invited us to: church, work out, etc. Checked in with us several times to make sure we didn’t need anything. She was like a fairy dropping the items off. Thank you Heather!"

So much thought went into every detail and truly makes the loft the perfect little get-away! The entire space was immaculately clean and stocked with everything you could possibly need and then some. Drinking coffee on the balcony in the mornings and looking out over the property was an added bonus as well! The property is on a quite street and felt very safe! I can’t say enough how much we enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","Heather’s Loft was so cute! My husband and I stayed two nights to be able to rock climb at Dayton’s Pocket. The trailhead was only ten minutes away so it was SUPER convenient for us. Heathers loft was so comfy to come back to at the end of the day and had any pots and pans I needed to be able to cook that evening. Running into the little animals outside on her property was so adorable. Very calming, relaxing and private. We will 100% stay again when we venture back out that way. Thanks Heather!"

The bed was very comfortable, and the linens were beautiful. We kept our boat tied up at the dock which was a very short distance from the house. This enabled us to fish from dawn to dusk. With the walk out sliding doors to the outside area it felt very private and led to a beautiful outside seating area with an amazing view of the lake. We even fished off of the dock at night. Would highly recommend this for anyone looking for beautiful place to stay on Lake Chickamauga!"

Note there are times during the fall/winter season when the lake is lowered as a precaution to avoid flooding in the spring. The water is not accessible via the dock. You can do a wet start but it was pretty muddy when we were there."

Group trip","Ms. Katherine is a fabulous host. Was very quick to respond to our questions. Her home is beautiful and exactly as described. We would definitely recommend this home. From this home it’s only about 45 min to white water rafting on the Ocoee river.
Downtown Dayton is lovely to walk around.
Very quick to Chattanooga downtown as well."

My family was excited to see lightning bugs in the back yard, haven't seen any since we moved to Texas from Michigan. Overall, it was very nice. The property and the home are very well cared for.

Consideration for families (even provided puzzles and board games). Wifi worked. About 1hr from Chattanooga. Nice touches. You MUST try the cute pizza place- 1st avenue pizza was the most delicious. And they were all very friendly and welcoming. Nice town. Make sure you go grocery shopping prior to arriving if you like a lot of options. There is a train nearby. But even with that it wasn’t too disruptive. This is upstairs and downstairs (townhouse). Just keep in mind if you have little ones who aren’t used to stairs. Bring your own baby gate if you’re concerned about that. AC worked well. Water was hot in the tub."

Stayed a few nights","From what I understand, Anthony & Lisa are turning this house from their primary residence into an AirBnB. They are still somewhat in the process of making the switch, and we were their first guest. I suspect there are still a few things they plan to do as they complete the change over. However, we were very comfortable and at home here! There was plenty of space, including 3 bedrooms (although one of the beds was terribly squeaky), 2.5 baths, a laundry room, and an extra family room in the basement. We cooked quite a bit in the kitchen- it had everything we needed to make full meals. We enjoyed watching the goats (I don’t know if they will remain at the residence, but they are pretty cool characters). And the location of the house, up the hill at the end of the road, made for a peaceful stay. The best part for us was the close proximity to Bryan College (5 minutes), since we were visiting our daughter there! I would not hesitate to stay again (and probably will)!"

Stayed one night","This tiny home was super nice. Very peaceful and private. It’s brand new and very clean. Autumn is very responsive to any questions or concerns. We stayed for 1 night on our way home from PCB. It was exactly how its pictures look and is described. Just an fyi… there’s no stove or oven. Only grill outside. Also small electric griddle and microwave inside. So there’s ways to cook or heat things up. But don’t plan on anything you must bake or boil. Which was fine with us. Grilling was perfect! Also there’s no coverage or shelter from the sun/rain outside( except for a little tree shade off to the side) But I did suggest some sort of porch, awning or umbrella. Autumn appreciated the suggestion and said she’d be getting something put up. So I would definitely stay here again. 10/10 HIGHLY recommend!! It was a perfect little hidden gem and the hot tub made for a restful nights sleep ❤️"

The space was very clean and cozy. The only things stopping this from being 5 stars is my husband and I are taller people and this space is rather small and low. My husband is 6’4 and his head touched the ceiling at times based on specific parts of the floor where it was uneven. We also wished there was a door in between the bedroom and living space because we had our toddler with us and with no door, it was a little difficult to keep her asleep since it is a rather small space (as advertised :)) there wasn’t many options to put her.
While you could squeeze your own air mattress into the living room, it would be difficult to sleep 4 people."

Stayed a few nights","Planning a last-minute anniversary trip during a pandemic is risky and challenging. Honestly, Dayton wasn’t even on our radar when we started searching. Uncomfortable with the thought of a hotel stay and waiting until the last minute caused us to search outside our intended radius. What an unexpected blessing to find this gem! If you’re searching for quiet and relaxing, this is a county setting is off the beaten path (but still convenient to Dayton). I guarantee your hotel stay could not be this peaceful. Linda’s personal touches little extras, and a super comfy bed made it feel like home. This is definitely on the visit again list!"

Stayed with a pet","Fantastic communication and little house was just as described. Except for the 2nd step located in the bedroom by the back door. My fault that I didn't notice it as I was looking for an outlet for my charger and fell. Internet can get spotty at times but Jeremy let me know to just unplug the cable by the AC, wait then replug it in. Worked great after that. He actually let us check in a little earlier than 3 and the house was so warm and welcoming and smelled wonderful.
There was a Keurig basket with popcorn and a delicious candy set up with some yummy chocolates that I'll definitely be ordering some of. Kitchen is stocked with plenty of dishes for anyone wanting to cook and there's plenty of games on top of the fridge. There wasn't a bunch of strict rules like I've heard some Airbnbs have. All he asked was for the garbage to be taken out to the dumpster across the road.
I highly recommend anyone to stay here. Super easy to get to but very private and quiet area."

I stayed a week and every day I would walk in and enjoy the aroma. the kitchen and living quarters are spacious and clean, laundry area was definitely a plus. tucked into the woods in a quiet neighborhood with a police as a neighbor so I felt safe. the couch was comfy and I slept on the couch since there was no TV in the bedroom. the only thing I didn't love was the bedroom without a TV. the owner answered my questions quickly. I enjoyed the stay"

It is more of a rustic cabin and keep in mind that there are quite a few different levels throughout the house. This was not ideal for our family due to my 10 month old being able to wander and crawl around. The cabin overall was very clean but I have sensitive allergies as well.

The bed room was way to small . The back door Is in the bedroom and when u come in the back door their is a real steep step that u have to step up on and what is really bad about it is the bed is right their where u have to step up at and to get around to the right side of the bed u have to literally walk side ways and be very cautious not to step off of it and fall . I would say u only got maybe 12in in between the foot of the bed and the step that drops off that goes to the back door that is dangerous and unsafe. I did accidentally not paying attention how close I was to the step and stepped off of it and fell. It all so had them little aunts in their and one time they somehow got all in my purse. We also seen a couple of roaches we killed the ones we saw. It was just a bad experience for us . The bed was real noisy getting on it and off of it and it was not a real stable bed"

They also left a box of toys and coloring books for our children, which was much appreciated also."

Stayed one night",We enjoyed this eclectic cottage. It was a nice alternative to a hotel with a full kitchen and living room area and still convenient to visit our daughter at Bryan College.

Stayed one night","This cottage is a fantastic spot to get away. The location is great, it’s not far from food not to mention Dayton boat ramp is about 5 minute later away which is nice considering I come to Dayton to fish lake chickamaugau. Wether you are coming for a nice getaway or looking to enjoy the lake I would highly recommend checking this place out. It’s very affordable and the area is nice."

Stayed a few nights","Besides the beds, we have no any complaints about this cottage . The mattresses are too noisy to sleep(the quality isn’t good we think ). We stayed there for 3 nights. That’s a big issue.
The country road outside of cottage is a little surprise, rarely vehicles drive by.It’s good for running.
Btw, host is very thoughtful, prepared some snacks and small useful items,and opened ac in advance, we were appreciated."

Stayed a few nights",The place was very clean and comfortable. It was close to town and major roads for traveling around. The Tennessee river is also close. The barbeque that Dave owns right down the street is great. There is also a good mexican restaurant clise. We would stay again if we come back to the area.

Stayed one night",We rented Jeremy's place as an emergency stop due to weather on our way home from Washington DC and Pigeon Forge. It was an amazing little hideaway and we were actually happy the weather forced us to stop. We would love to stay there again any time.
