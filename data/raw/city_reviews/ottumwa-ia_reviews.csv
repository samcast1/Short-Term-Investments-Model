Stayed a few nights","We visited Ottumwa for our daughter’s graduation and stumbled upon this listing, which turned out to be perfect for us. Renting it was smooth, with our host being very responsive and informative. Leading up to check-in, they provided helpful details about the house and the town. Checking in was easy, and the house exceeded our expectations, especially with its updated ground floor and beautiful, functional kitchen. We loved the peaceful, well-kept backyard and enjoyed using the BBQ and patio seating. The retro upper floor and basement were charmingly refurbished, with great color schemes throughout. Overall, we had a fantastic time, and even though our daughter has graduated, we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if we’re ever back in the area."

Open porch to keep hunting gear so it won’t pick up human smells, not to far from Iowa state land for out of towners, and if you see nothing during your hunt then the deer are waiting for you in the yard to tease you when you return. We’ll be returning."

It was very peaceful and relaxing. The weather was terrific for this time of year. It reminded us of the day we got married on 41 years ago. Sunday we celebrated our 41st Anniversary.
Thank you for a wonderful experience.

Stayed with kids","Wow! It's hard to put into words what an amazing place this is. I can't recommend it enough! Our family was in town for some difficult reasons and Karissa's compassion and kindness stood out from the very beginning when I reached out. Her communication was outstanding and lightning-fast! When we needed to extend our stay, she was more than happy to accommodate us. The home was incredibly peaceful and restful; we sat on the porch each day for hours watching the beautiful birds and most days we had deer for visitors. Though it's very close to all that you might need (gas station, groceries, etc), the home feels like you're on a retreat in the woods. Zero hesitations in recommending this place whole-heartedly!"

Stayed with kids","Best host I've dealt with. One of her chairs broke when my 16 year old son sat in it. Her first response was to ask if he was ok. I didn't even mention that he was autistic. So I immediately knew she was a very kind person. She messaged me before I got there to ask if there was anything I needed. Very on top of things. Gave recommendations for restaurants, which I thought was nice. I'm originally from there, but haven't lived there in years, so it's nice to know what's new. Place was very clean and extremely roomy (I wish my bedroom was that big lol). Loved the basement area. Just wish we had more time to spend there, it was a short trip. Thank you so much. Definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights",This is a wonderful place to stay for a family or small group in Ottumwa. It is very private at the end of a road that looks out onto the woods and a beautiful view. We enjoyed sitting out on the back deck and watching the deer and the birds. The kitchen and dining room are also great for cooking meals and hanging out. The king bed in the primary bedroom is super comfortable and there is also a bunkbed in another bedroom and a sweet bedroom downstairs. The downstairs could be its own rental and I am so glad they did not divide it up since it is so great to be able to rent the whole thing. This place is a winner! We hope to stay there again.

The house was perfect for our family and allowed as to spend more time together as we were traveling from different locations and wanted to maximize our time together (a hotel would not have done this). The house was clean and the setting was nice. The linens were nice and we had plenty of nice towels. The kitchen is a good size and we enjoyed having it available to prepare our favorite breakfast. The house was decorated for the holidays which was a nice touch. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for us to spend time together but also enjoy our own space and privacy when needed. Karissa was very responsive, although we didnt really have any questions or needs during our visit. This is a do over for us! I highly recommend this for anyone staying in Ottumwa and/or visiting family and friends in southeast Iowa."

It was extremely clean, fresh, up to date, and decorated very tastefully. We especially enjoyed the coziness of the living room, the spaciousness of the well equipped kitchen, the inviting dining area, and the great view from all the windows. The weather allowed for only a little hiking and use of the deck, but the natural setting is beautiful. This stay allowed our family to be together for Thanksgiving in a perfect setting, and it will be one of our most memorable. Thank you!"

Place was close to downtown and had a little wooded area with different kinds of wildlife (even seen a beaver!). Apartment was extremely clean and I felt it was bigger than the picture portrayed and was remodeled with higher end finishes. Tons of towels and washer and dryer was huge plus. (Shampoo, conditioner, & body wash was available). Full size kitchen with enough stuff to cook a meal but limited plates. Only thing I would say is that there was cameras on the building that I did not see listed in the ad, if that matters to anyone. Overall really great place!"

There was plenty of seating and a concrete drive that was a great asset also. It was a good deal for the money. We will be using this service again when visiting our family.

We found Albia to be a quiet and quaint town with people who take pride in the maintenance of their downtown area which dates back to the 1850's. We also met several locals who were friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. Stores and restaurants were close by making it convenient when needed.
Had an overall great stay and wouldn't hesitate to re-book again!"

The location was perfect—close to everything we wanted to do. Our family who live nearby were all very jealous of our cozy accommodations.
We highly recommend this carriage house to anyone looking for a great place to stay. Thank you to our hosts for making our trip so enjoyable!"

Stayed a few nights","Quaint historical property. Enjoyed it quite a bit and the airbnb was pretty well set up. The few negatives were the computer area takes up a lot of room, there is an old truck with cobwebs/dust just sitting in right where you park by the airbnb plus the yard of the house is full of items and several vehicles taking up space, making the overall area fairly junkier than the pictures indicate…also, did not receive any communication from the host leading up to or after our stay. All hosts I have dealt with at least reach out the day of, if not before, to introduce themselves and then upon arrival, follow up to see if we need anything. I did not receive any of that from Erica. Nothing against them personally but there was definitely a lack of communication and I was quite surprised and a little frustrated."

Stayed one night","I drove in at night and Erica had the lights on for me. The town square of Bloomfield was charming with its historic courthouse and holiday lights around the square -it's also only two or so blocks away so easy to walk over. The bnb is a detached carriage house next to an old home, all rather historic. The interior is funky in a fun way. Erica had holiday lights on to add to the spirit of things. I had two beds to choose from (traveling alone), a kitchen with all the necessities, and plenty of space. There was also water, coffee, yogurt and home made granola -I don't eat sugar, but Erica sent me the recipe, and so I disobeyed the doctor just this once to try some on my breakfast yogurt :-). One thing a new guest may want to consider is that the bathroom is on the first floor and the rest on the second, so if navigating stairs is an issue for you, the carriage house probably isn't your best bet. For me, it was no problem. Really neat place to stay -feels like stepping into history."

The abode was beyond spacious! And it included a bath, kitchen, and laundry room. The bath was luxurious, complete with soaps, shampoos, hair dryer. The kitchen had all of the condiments you could need. And the laundry had both a washer and dryer. Plus, there were extra blankets, sheets, and pillows. The only 2 things that I would recommend adding would be a full length mirror and a dish washer. (Although we had no need for a dish washer during our stay.)
Thank you Samantha!"

Group trip","I must say I loved not having neighbors lol even though it was old folks mainly on this trip. We came here to attend my brothers only son high school graduation and everything was great. One family member complained about not having a tv in every room but we were hardly there anyway. I love the updated remodeling of the home and once again property was very nice and my mom is 70 plus years old and she admired all of the older furniture. If you want a quiet, clean and up to date space for the weekend this is the place. Also, it’s a Walmart probably 6 minutes away and further down the street it’s a few restaurants such as kfc, subway etc. my nephew will being going to college soon and I hope this place is available when we come back for the next graduation! Thank you for having us!"

The hosts were so sweet and welcoming and even went out of their way to come support the local football team and that was a very cool experience getting to meet them!

We especially enjoyed the rooftop hot-tub, where we were able to enjoy the Fourth of July fireworks. The apartment features non-toxic building materials and was noticeably free from allergens.
Can’t wait to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",Aaron was a wonderful host and the space was magnificent! He was very responsive to messages and always accommodating. We had an issue with the air conditioning (the first hot weekend of the spring so no one has probably used it yet) and he had someone out to fix it within an hour or so on Memorial day weekend! Just goes to show he will go out of his way to make sure his guests are comfortable and taken care of. He had great local recommendations. The indoor space itself is gorgeous and very luxurious. The rooftop and hot tub (filled with new water upon arrival!) area was also very nice and private. The instructions on how to use everything were clear and even included QR codes to videos! If you're spending time in Fairfield I would whole-heartedly recommend staying here!

The loft has everything you would need to make your stay comfortable and cozy. It is beautifully decorated and provides an open and accommodating feel.
There are about 30 steps up a staircase to the door. Something to keep in mind while considering this stay.
Aaron is incredibly responsive and thoughtful. They want to ensure your stay is perfect! If you’re thinking about booking, DO IT! You’ll love the rest and relaxation this space will provide you."

Stayed a few nights","Aaron and Melanny’s loft in Fairfield is a hidden gem!! ✨ Their Airbnb is by far the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. The entrance to the loft is through an ally, up a long flight of stairs, and down a hallway. This journey is worth it, I promise. All of the amenities in the loft are high end - the open tiled shower, claw foot tub, heated bathroom floor, open kitchen, comfortable beds, remote controlled black out curtains, projector tv screen, and best of all the rooftop deck. Don’t be intimidated by the roof hatch, we found it very simple to use. Once you make your way through the hatch you will transported to an outdoor oasis. We enjoyed using the hot tub and soaking up the sun on the turf. Aaron did a great job labeling everything and giving clear instructions for all of the amenities throughout the loft. We’d like to keep this loft a well kept secret but that will be difficult due to the wonderful time we had. Thanks Aaron and Melanny for your hospitality! We hope to be back soon!"

Aaron was attentive to any questions we had and he is just a really chill guy. Our first impressions walking in was that it was super clean, spacious, and had the vibes of luxury and relaxation! Bathroom was top notch! The rooftop hot tub and turf area made this air bnb feel like a destination instead of just an overnight pit stop. We enjoyed some time in the morning soaking up the sun and drinking a espresso while on the rooftop….ah, We could’ve stayed for a couple more days! We tried out 6 of the local restaurants/coffee shops and all had outstanding food! We highly recommend Aaron as a host and the loft!"

Stayed a few nights","Hosts are pleasant enough, and mean well. Location is easy to find and easy to access. Laundry room/entry smells like dead mops. Poor lighting there with black doors. Window unit in main room worked well - but the stand-alone unit in bedroom was LOUD and pretty useless. Very hot in the room until 3:AM Weird sheets and plasticized mattress cover made the hot room worse.
Low ceilings and doorways make it a head banger. Kitchen light hangs right in walking path, hit my head repeatedly there. More safety: There is NO smoke detector in the place, light switches hard to find and no railing on stair to bedroom.
Bathroom tub shower did not drain AT ALL. Yucky standing in my dirty shower water. Host said they would look into it, but no change. Hosts have indicated that they really will fix this issue after my second complaint.
Coffee table filthy. Host expects you to wash the linens and towels at end. Uh. $50 cleaning fee is for what? Really not a pleasant or restful stay, for me..."

I was grateful that they allowed my cats there! Sasha and Tesla had a great time exploring...and found the bed and living room couch irresistible. 😸😸
Location-wise, it is about 45 minutes from Pella, where an awesome annual tulip festival is held. I didn't try many of the restaurants in Ottumwa itself, but Bubba's was good, and Mike's Pizza made the best calzones I've ever had.
I'm already plotting with my husband to come out again next spring!"

We didn’t find it to be quite as clean as other reviewers mentioned, but found it to be workable. The steep stairs they mention shouldn’t be taken lightly, and there is no railing into the bedroom, so if you find stairs difficult it might not be the place for you. All in all we found it to be an okay spot, and appreciated that they had kitchen basics so we could cook a few meals."

Stayed a few nights","At first glance, this place looked very nice. They hung a sign outside the entrance “Blue Fern Hotel”. Its a house. Not a hotel. Its location is nice...during the day. The hosts seemed nice when I asked them if this place would fit my needs. In that Iowa friendly way they assured me it would.
However, the reality of this listing is it’s just a pretty picture. The most concerning report is the unsafe shallow steps on the stairway that is not built to code and has a railing not secured into studs properly, and the illegal bedroom without fire egress as well as hanging hot lightbulbs in the kitchen that a person has to walk around not to hit.
The hosts claimed it would accommodate myself and 2 teen sons and service dog. It did not.
The safety railing was not anchored into the wall when you enter the house. They used wood screws and just screwed it into the drywall. The futon had very little padding and several cross bars the made it impossible for anyone to sleep on.
The bedroom is up a few unguarded steps into a room with a very hard, full size bed and hard lumpy pillows. The bedroom is very small and the pitch of the roof is too close to the bed so that people hit their head getting in and out of bed. There are no windows in the bedroom which I discovered is illegal in Iowa.
The whole level of the main room is off and feels like you’re walking in a funny house.
I came into town to care for my ailing mother and could only sleep there for 2 nights of a 10 day stay. My sons slept there the first 2 nights and complained of how uncomfortable it was and they are boy scouts used to roughing it.
I stayed the following 2 nights while my boys stayed with my parents and agreed. We found much better accommodations and canceled the rest of the stay.
When I made my complaint to airbnb and the hosts, the hosts offered to reimburse the whole stay and make the repairs and I regained respect for the hosts and planned on checking out their other listing in the lower level of the house for future stays and to recommend to friends coming up to visit over the summer.
Then the hosts blamed the builders for the hand railing and did not care that the stairs are so steeply pitched and shallow they are difficult for anyone to use. They clearly dont care about their guest’s safety or comfort.
They became defensive saying no one else complained.
Even though the hosts offered to reimburse the whole stay, I was still charged. The only change they made to the place was to edit the occupancy listing from 3 to 2.
The photos of Ottumwa are heavily photoshopped. There are plenty of natural areas and bike riding trails to promote honestly without creative photography schemes to make Ottumwa look like something it is not.
Now, If you like narrow doorways, low ceilings, scary stairs and wonky floors a sober person feels drunk walking on, and you dont care if you fall down steps in the middle of the night to get to the bathroom after sleeping on a rock hard bed with lumpy pillows, that neighbors fire off guns or fireworks and sell drugs a few houses down and all for the low price of $51 a night...this is the place for you. By all means, enjoy.
On a positive note, this above garage and attic space death trap was clean and tidy."

They could not do all the stairs. Scary at night to go down 5 stairs and no handrail from the bedroom to main living area. Great response on questions but here again no mention that they did not at least have local television channels.

Stayed a few nights","This is the BEST place to stay in Ottumwa if you need a little extra space. I've always stayed at hotels with my 4 kids and this is a game changer! The place is cute, tidy, clean, and peaceful. The space is nice so the kids can get away from each other if needed. Check in and check out was easy. The best part? Brice and Brielle had EXCELLENT communication througout the whole process! We were rear ended on the 12 hour road trip on the way, and they were genuinely concerned for us. It was nice to have a peaceful, quiet place to sort out the after affects of the wreck and dealing with insurance while on my vacation. I will never stay anywhere else when I go back to visit my family in Ottumwa, this is my new home away from home. If you're not sure if you should rent the place, spend the extra money and DO IT!"

Stayed a few nights","I'm so grateful for the opportunity to stay at Bryce and Brielle's. The neighborhood was nice and quiet--exactly what were were looking for. Parking was easy and convenient in the driveway--along with self-checkin keypad. Ottumwa had hot weather during our visit--and as soon as we walked into the house, we were greeted with refreshingly cool air from the AC--very much appreciated! The two bedrooms were perfect for my mom and me--with blinds and curtains to fully darken the rooms at night. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our meals--and also a nice dining area/ table. Living room and couches were also very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and spacious with updated amenities. In addition, there were incredibly sweet little touches around...delicious chocolates on the dining table, extra toothbrush/travel kits in the bathroom, a binder of local attractions, lovely landscaping....ect. Bryce and Brielle were easy to connect with (I used the texting feature on the Airbnb app) and kind, conscientious hosts. Overall, we well taken care of...and came away from our stay feeling enriched:))"

Stayed one night","I hadn’t been home to Ottumwa in 16 years. Not only did I have a magnificent time, but to walk into such a beautiful Airbnb, just made the trip that much better. I took many pictures because I do a lot of write ups on Google (over 10 million views), and wanted to spread the word on this beautiful location. Clean, updated and very well decorated. Full of “necessities” like coffee, snacks, and other food stuff just in case. Lots of fresh towels, clean pillows, small blankets. I’ll now be working to book this every time I come home, and I don’t plan on it being in another 10+ years. Thank you for responding to my text questions quickly."

Served our needs perfectly. Plenty of room, very clean, exactly what we needed to meet the needs of our family. Now when we visit Ottumwa there is no doubt where we will want to stay. Excellent value and landlords very considerate to work with when issues arise. Such a great place for a family trip to

Luckily the other side did and there were only 2 of us. So it worked out and we just didn’t utilize that side.

Walking distance to restaurants and shops, very quiet and peaceful. Kid friendly, our son spent our whole stay jumping on the trampoline. Very spacious and we loved the jacuzzi. A few eccentricities (definitely an old building), but it just added to the charming character. Host was very friendly and responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
