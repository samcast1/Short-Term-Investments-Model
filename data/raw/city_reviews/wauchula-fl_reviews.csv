Stayed a few nights","This is an excellent place for a quiet getaway. The view of the lake from the backyard is beautiful and peaceful. My stay was for a business trip, so I couldn't take advantage of the lake or the boats they have to use, but I'm sure it would be fun. The house is old but clean, functional, and comfortable. The couches in the living area are comfortable and offer a great view of the backyard and the lake, and the pool table would be great entertainment for a family or small group of friends."

Stayed with a pet","This was our second time staying here and we would definitely come back again. The scenery is beautiful, great views and wildlife would always visit on the dock. It’s like a home away from home. Great space and pretty comfortable. They were extremely communicative and check in was easy, even though we didn’t get there until after 8:30pm/9pm the night of check in. I would recommend this host to anyone and would definitely recommend this home for anyone needing a place to stay in the area. It’s close to everything you would need and not fair at all from Sebring that has even more to offer (15 mins if that from Publix)."

Stayed a few nights","Weather was cloudy and it drizzled during my stay, but it didn't damper anything. I enjoyed it even more without the beating sun and didn't need to turn on the ac. The air was clean inside and out. Picture-perfect view of the lake and beautiful moss-covered, large oak trees from the comfort of the cozy and spacious family room's nearly wall-to-wall windows--great layout. I saw a group of cute ducks in the morning dunking their heads in the water for food and shaking their tails in the air. There is sand and the water is clear. Plenty of equipment for fishing and spending time on the lake. Overall, very serenely peaceful and ultra-relaxing and the hosts are a friendly and responsive couple."

Stayed a few nights","This was our 3rd stay at the lake House. We always enjoy our selfs with all there is to do. Fishing early mornings, Bass and bluegill. Horse shoes on beach and corn hole. Game of pool at night. Enjoying the nature, owl, Sandhill Cranes. Our Greyhound loves the full fenced yard and laying on the beach. The house is always clean and comfortable. I personally just love this this place! Being from Michigan it reminds me of going up north to the cottage. clean and comfortable..
Thank you
Phil and Sonya
Ice always in the freezer and stocked with bags. Don’t forget your beach towels. We always put a foot rinse bucket on the back porch. :) see you next time."

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our relaxing time at this lakehouse. The inside was a bit dated, but fine and comfortable for a low key trip and very consistent with the advertised pictures. The owner communicated upfront about the fact that the dock was unusable due to damage from Hurricane Ian. The provided kayaks were also a bonus. We cooked most of our meals at the house and didn't find that we were missing anything essential in the kitchen. There was also a separate wet bar area in the living room with a sink and mini-fridge which made for a nice place to make coffee and keep drinks cold. Overall, we will likely plan to come back for another stay in the future."

The new pool table was great fun and the sunsets were so gorgeous over the lake. Phil and Sonya were extremely helpful when the heat wasn't working on Christmas eve. They made a special trip to come and check everything out for us and it turned out to be an easy fix. They even brought extra blankets and a space heater just in case. We loved our time there!

Phil & Sonia were great hosts! Responded very quickly, and were very accommodating. Sonia was also great at communicating with us and checked we were OK during our stay. I mean we couldn’t ask for better!!! Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful, the house was also clean. Overall a wonderful place; we would stay here again easily!

Stayed with a pet","This lake house is very comfortable and has great amenities such as floats, yard games, a hammock under the trees. The lake is beautiful and there are several canoes, kayaks and a little John boat. The dock is large, private and covered which makes it the perfect place to catch that lake breeze on the dock swing. The front and back yard are fully fenced (my German Shepherd could jump the fence so if you have an escape artist…). There were no close neighbor dogs when we were there if you have a reactive pup. The kitchen is fully furnished with kitchenware, even a crockpot and air fryer. The outside grill is small so if you want to grill meat and sides for a family of four, you may need to cook in batches. The beds are super comfortable, the furniture in the den cozy. There is traffic noise from the road which is my only complaint but it’s not heard in the house. Our family spent a whole week there and rarely had to leave. It was our home away from home and we really enjoyed staying there."

Stayed with kids","This lovely lake house is more than what I expected. I was hesitant to book it as I thought lake Letta is not big enough😀 . But it turned out that Lake Letta is the best as the water is so clean and the whole lake is so tranquil (it is big) the whole time. The lake house stands out with the beautiful dock and my family enjoyed a lot with fishing and sunsets sightseeing on it. The lake house has more than enough amenities to give us what we need during the stay. The house was built many years ago but has been maintained very well and spotless. Highlights: My puppy got so excited running in the huge fenced front yard; fishing and got big size bass and crappie, and cook fish over fire pit; amazing sunset and sunrise; placid lake with lots of privacy; quick and easy communication! Thanks a lot for sharing your beautiful lake house!"

Stayed a few nights","Our experience with host, Phil Rasmussen was very accommodating in every way with anything we needed.

The Lakehouse was clean and had a dehumidifier so there were absolutely no issues with air quality or odors. For those with allergies, like me, that is always a concern; but the place was free of any odors or mold or musty smells. Was just perfect.

My husband was recuperating from kidney stone surgery and so it was a great place to just relax with no stress. I was able to cook for us and watch TV and just chill which is what we both needed. And stores in town were not far and easy to get to.

The sunsets at the dock were breathtaking and so I took many amazing g photos. I had my 84 yr old mother with me and she thoroughly enjoyed herself and claimed the recliner in front of the TV as ""her spot.""

We have two dogs and even though we kept them on leash when outside, the fenced in yard was reassuring. A great place for families and also a very cool Tree House for kids to enjoy.

The wildlife was plentiful including a hawk on the fence the first morning watching the squirrels play. Thought he might have one for breakfast but he was just enjoying watching them run around the yard...they were great entertainment.

There were also blue herons and red crested sand hill cranes and fish jumping in Lake Letta.

I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.

Thank you for your hospitality, Rasmussen's. We'll DEFINITELY be back!!!!!

Sincerely,

Tom & Rachael Streifel

Stayed over a week","My wife and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Lake Letta house. We felt right at home the moment we arrived. Very quiet and relaxing. Everything we needed was there. It reminded me of going to my grandparent's house. The dock and the lake were wonderful and we spent every evening out there until bedtime.

We just got home yesterday and I've already requested another week in July. Can't wait!"

We hope to return again someday :)"

The house was very large and comfortable. More than enough for two, but easily accommodating four or six. The lake is beautiful and the dock offers a wonderful view. Phil and Sonya were excellent hosts. We spoke to them on arrival via phone. They were very hospitable. At one point during our trip we had a small issue, but they were very quick to resolve it. Overall the experience was very pleasant and we would definitely go back. Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","The Lake Letta Lakehouse was a perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I, and the house itself was very comfortable. What was meant to be a relaxing weekend spent by the lake ended up as so much more. As Avon Park and Sebring are both very close to the house, and both were offering festivities during the weekend we were there. The sunsets from the dock are amazing and the view from the house is also great. Phil was a great host, with simple instructions for check in and check out as well as instructions for things around the house. I would highly recommend the Lakehouse for a great vacation or getaway. Oh, and by the way, the girlfriend I mentioned earlier became my fiance on the swing in the dock."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was absolutely phenomenal. The location was easy to find, & the perfect distance from my nieces graduation and Sebring shopping/dining.
There was house warming charm as soon as we walked in. My dad noticed the record player aknits instantly & put on some tunes! -Haven’t seen him smile like that in a while! The flexible check in was my first point of pleasure, the cleanliness and “right at home” feel was by far my favorite. Plenty of yard space and more than enough room inside for family gatherings. Made me want to bring my whole family back when we come to visit my sister! 🥰 The bathrooms were clean and stocked with anything if we forgot something (but I don’t pack light. 😉)
-Our host Micheal was always responding almost instantly with anything I asked. He was very friendly, and very flexible with us, and that I am extremely thankful for! The location is in a nice quiet neighborhood and is so beautiful at night! The price was unbelievable!
100/10

After a little frustration trying to figure out why, discovered the TV system was left unplugged from wall outlet. Water had an odd odor and horrible taste. Had to purchase bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth. Suspect this is public water system issue."

Stayed with kids","My family stayed for the weekend to visit family in the area in July 2023. We have two small kids (19 months and 6 years old) and we could not have been anymore pleased with the house. It was centrally located, well maintained, and very clean. My wife and I felt that our kids were safe and that Kendall's home was well sanitized. The linens were very nice and bright white and the beds were very nice and comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer during our stay was amazing! The house had more than enough space and furniture to accommodate a family of four, but could just as easily have accommodated a family twice our size. Kendall was very easy to work with and was very responsive. It is nice to see a host that takes care of their property and goes above and beyond to make their guests feel welcomed. As mentioned before, we have family in the area and frequently make the trip to Arcadia. We will definitely be booking this house in the future if it is available!"

The home had a lot of natural lighting from the windows and high ceilings with an open airy floor plan. Only personal issue I had was the house smelling like FeBreze when we first entered. I do not do well with perfume smells. But once I opened the windows it was all aired out in no time. Most probably would not even been bothered with this, but it was my only complaint. I still give the place 5 stars."

We were very thankful this host thought of keeping a cork screw here since we forgot ours.
Very clean and adorable decorations too! we just over the place and the area. It was very quiet and safe neighborhood and the public beach was 1 minute down the road, which was very nice. Water was refreshing after laying out in sun.
Not a lot to do but there was an age throwing place and some really good restaurant's like Dee's place we went to for breakfast and Sunset Bar & Grille on the water again just like 5 mins if that from the cottage."

The kitchen provided all that we needed to prepare all of our meals. The private and secluded screened-in back patio was heavenly for morning coffee.

From the moment you walk in you’re greeted with an open floor plan, that matches exactly the pictures on the listing. 2 living rooms gave my family plenty of space to stretch out and relax. The kitchen was fully stocked, and when I mean fully I mean everything you could possibly need to prepare a meal, from dishes, to cups, utensils, to coffee and creamer, and seasonings, pots and pans, a cutting board, peeler, blender, toaster, microwave, you name it, this kitchen has. The beds were super comfortable. Lots of towels that smelled freshly washed. The home has a washer and dryer which came in handy for us after a long day on the lake. Overall we highly enjoyed our stay and experience. We will definitely stay here again when we come back into town. Love this house!"

The bed in he master bedroom was so comfortable and we really enjoyed the large kitchen.
Outside we enjoyed bumping the volleyball with each other and wandering through the orange grove.
Oh, and the coffee cake was delish! If we are in the area we will definitely stay again. We had such a fun and relaxing time."

Stayed with kids","The hosts were very responsive and helpful at all times. We arrived late night so it was dark to get to but they left the outside and some inside lights on for us. Getting into the house was very easy, the parking spot is super close to the entrance. Once we made it inside, there was a nice handwritten note along with freshly baked coffee cake on the table for us. That was the cherry on top, what a sweet gesture! The house was very clean, they literally had everything we needed, they were very accommodating as well. In the morning we went out to walk around and see the area, a golden retriever came to us (from a neighbors house, I assume) and was so friendly! It was a great surprise.
Overall, the place was great, comfortable, peaceful and everything we needed for our stay. We definitely wish we could’ve stayed another night. Amazing hosts, thank you for being great and loving what you do!!!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at the Grovehouse! What a perfect spot in Arcadia. When we arrived, we were greeted with a warm cinnamon coffee cake on the kitchen table. It was delicious! The 2-story apartment/house gave us plenty of room to spread out. The upstairs area was perfect for our 2 teenage boys with twin beds, 2 sofas and a foosball table. (The stairs are steep and probably not suitable for small children.) Downstairs we enjoyed a very comfortable queen bed, beautiful kitchen, full size washer and dryer, and clean bathroom. It was very quiet and peaceful the entire time we were there. We enjoyed dinner at the outside table. Each morning a group of beautiful peahens would come through the property foraging for insects. We really had a great time and would stay here again next time we are in Arcadia!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my first time visiting Central Florida. Now I know where all of the Oranges and Beef comes from. There are miles of farm land in this area. The location in Arcadia is a little remote but did work for my visit with just a 40min drive to my weekend destination. The apartment was very clean and modern. Exactly as described and just like to photos. There is no TV...which at first I was not sure about but didn't effect my stay as I was able to catch up on much needed sleep in the peace and quiet of the surroundings and the super comfy queen size bed. There were way more amenities in the apartment than I needed for my short stay but I really appreciated the coffee bar and the nice home baked cinnamon coffee cake waiting for me when I checked in. Thanks Kendall, if I get back to this area again I will certainty try and stay at the Grove again."

We would’ve loved to relax and watch a movie. It was super convenient having a washer and dryer, everything was clean and the upstairs was fun with the games. The steps are a little shallow so be careful on those middle of the night bathroom runs but overall the place was great. We left a small BBQ for the next family to enjoy!"

I do wish I had brought a chair and umbrella in order to sit outside. There’s no where to really be outside other than in the ant infested yard. (No porch) Don’t forget to pack books and board games. I understood there was no tv before check in but there really isn’t anything for entertainment, so bring your own.
I would describe this place as a not-so-quiet country get away.
I would prefer being out that far in the country to be alone and not be sharing the building/ yard with other people. Or the feeling of being surrounded by people which this place very much has."

You will find water, fruits, oil, cheese, selection of sauces in the refrigerator and signature cinnamon pie on the table so if you arrived without visiting a store you will survive. The first floor is traditional with top quality of everything: from refrigerator-washer/dryer to lines and mattress. On the second floor you will find a sort of sophisticated country style design. Have you ever seen chandelier made from old spring mattress? :-) You will also find kids corner on the second floor and table football to play. The location is 1 h drive from beaches of crowded Sarasota and not very far from Orlando and other destinations in Central Florida. Perfect peaceful retreat both for businessman and family tired from big city."

Enormous property with full access down to the river. Cows, horses, wildlife and just a huge open space in rural Florida. Not fancy but certainly comfortable. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","Ana was very friendly and responsive to our needs. I do think there could be a few improvements. I would suggest a dresser in each bedroom. There wasn't anyplace to put your suitcase down. Although there were hangers in the closets, we like to take a few things out of our suitcases. ie. personal products, blow dryer, make up, hairbrush etc. There was just no place to set these item down. (We like to unpack). We were visiting friends in the area so were planning to have them for dinner and there were shortcomings in the kitchen which Ana and I resolved. I went to the store and she reimbursed me immediately. The step down to the dining room I would say could be a problem. All of us tripped at least once. I wish I had some yellow duct tape to mark the step. The bathroom is old and in need of a good scrubbing or renovation. I feel like she is just starting out and is trying really hard to make it nice. We wish her all the best."

Stayed with kids","We arrived at the home after dark and were feeling a little uneasy about the location. It was the last house on a street of some cluttered and junky homes. Not being from the area, we just weren’t sure about the safety of the area. And with it being dark, it was hard to get a good feel. However, after staying for a few days we felt that it was a safe area and the neighbors were friendly and kind! The house looked just as the pictures. It was simple and roomy - perfect for our family of 4. The home has basic essentials but nothing extra. And that was just fine for what we needed. It was clean, orderly, and open. The beds were comfortable, and it was nice to have access to Netflix for our kids to watch some shows. The host was responsive to a couple of our questions and very friendly. Check out instructions were simple and to the point. Overall, we are glad we stayed at Ana’s home and are thankful that we had it as an option while in Wauchula!"

Don't let the outside fool you, the home is very roomy and Ana was a wonderful hostess. She checked in on my team to be sure they got in OK and to see if we needed anything. She also provided an air mattress as we had 4 team members deployed during the time we rented Ana's home.
We would definitely reach out to Ana in the future to rent this quaint home if ever deployed in the area again.

There is an amazing outdoor area where there is a barbecue place, pool table, ping pong table , dart game and lots of entertainment for the whole family. There was a big swing outside that was a hit for the kids. Extremely picture worthy for the gram! There’s a library section that’s outdoors and so nice specially for photographers !

The property has a lot of things to keep you occupied without getting bored. Plenty of games, the outdoor play area is super cool, the kitchen has all the necessary supplies, plenty of plates, silverware, mugs, cups even wine glasses 👍🏻. We were greeted with a nice basket of snacks and 2 bottles of wine, perfect to kick off our new year’s weekend. There are a lot of lakes very close to the property (we visited lake placid) and it was very cool. Supermarkets 10-15min away. Very private property. Overall….. family approved! Thank you Betsy!"

Great shower too. Shaina was very quick to communicate with me. Location felt safe and private. Easy to find, park and access. Everything was as described, but even better!! All around great time! Would highly recommend this Airbnb!
Thank You!"

The kitchen is completely stocked with any type of cookware you may want to cook with during your stay. I did have a little trouble finding a comfortable setting for the shower. It seemed extremely hot or extremely cold. But, that may have been me not being used to my settings at home. Overall, everything was awesome. And I would highly recommend Shania and Kyle's place. I would definitely choose to stay again."

We were able to check in early and get to the wedding on time with no issues. Inside was very cozy and had everything we needed. If you are looking for a pet friendly accommodation with all the comforts of home, don’t hesitate to book here!"

Shaina was super friendly and communicated promptly when we had any questions. I loved that there was a full kitchen with plenty of supplies to make our own meals especially since we came to escape a hurricane! The best part was we could bring our fur babies with us! Definitely a great place to stay . Five stars for me !

Stayed one night","I had a little difficulty getting in but only because I couldn't get into my AirBnB account. Shaina sent me several emails and texts but it took a while for her to respond as she was out of town. She eventually let me in remotely and sent me a text with the door code.
The room was spotless and had everything I needed. My only issue was the softness of the bed. I have a bad back and prefer to sleep on a hard mattress. The King bed was a quality one... just too soft for my back. If you have a similar issue, a back board would probably resolve the issue.
Highly reccommended."

Stayed a few nights","Cottage was very clean, cozy and comfortable. The porch is super cute and very peaceful.
The back road to use to get to the parking space was a little confusing since it doesn't really look like a road, but made sense once I found it.
Houses around cottage could use some TLC, but it was very quiet and the police station is pretty much next door.
Traveling alone I tend to have my guard up more, but I have to say that there was no point where I didn't feel secure at Shaina's place.
Now if only there were some restaurant's, pubs and shops on Main St., it would be awesome since you can easily walk there in a matter of minutes.
Will definitely stay there again."

Thanks again for a great stay.

We didn’t use the kitchen but it looked like it would have been a good place to cook. Towels and all bathroom necessities were provided as well as some extras. I appreciated the trays of ice in the freezer very much (I’m an ice hog). We did not hear any roosters (for that I was grateful!😜!). Peaceful place to have coffee on the porch in the morning before heading out for the day.

Stayed about a week","For visiting relatives in a nearby RV park, Shaina’s place worked out very well. My husband and I were both able to work all week while my in-laws visited and we caught up with everyone at night. Shaina’s had plenty of room for 2 people. King bed, nice bathroom, full kitchen, and a screened porch with washer/dryer. It was very clean and comfortable. It was 10 min from the RV park. There is not much to do in the area so I wouldn’t just choose Wachula as my vacation spot. However, I’m sure we’ll visit the relatives next winter/spring and I will definitely hope to stay at Shaina’s again!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is amazing and exactly as described. Shaina was quick to respond on arrival day and even left the light on for me as I was delayed getting there. While this place is attached to Shaina's house you would never know it. The bedroom / living room is good sized with a comfy bed and a reclining love seat along with a good sized TV. The room also has a window unit and a ceiling fan that keeps the room quite comfortable. The bathroom is good sized and stocked with everything you need and the water pressure in the full size shower is more than adequate along with the water temp. I didn't use the kitchen but everything is there that you could need along with a full size fridge. By far the coolest part was the screened in porch that had a washer and dryer, which I didn't use, but also had a table and chairs where I could sit and drink a cold adult beverage while answering emails after a long day. I can't say enough about this place as it was a great choice in a quaint small town."

Stayed with a pet","The Craftsman on 8th in Wauchula, Fl. is a great, clean and very comfortable. My 94 year old father lives in Wauchula and we always love staying here. Shaina and Kyle are so friendly and helpful but also gives their guest the quietness during our stay. Friday night we walked to the cute downtown Main Street to enjoy the Friday Fun night. Games for kids and music through the streets.
You will not be disappointed in staying here. Very clean!
We will return soon as my dad will be 95 in April.

After searching with no success, they drove to a store and purchased a new one that evening even though we insisted it wasn’t necessary! Their guest suite is located in a quiet neighborhood. Shaina has equipped it with many comforts you have in your home. The screened patio is a pleasant place for meals/coffee. The bed is very comfortable and we slept soundly. Thank you Shaina & Kyle for a relaxing stay."

Stayed with a pet","I can’t even begin to express our gratitude to Shaina. We booked her Craftsman to flee from the worst hurricane this country has ever experienced. She and her husband welcomed us and our two dogs, gave us detailed check-in info (with pictures) and provided everything one could possibly need, including snacks, condiments and canned goods.
They promptly answered every single question.
Then the real test of a Superhost!
We learned that neighbors of ours from Port Charlotte were heading north with 5 birds, 3 dogs and a cat. Shaina agreed we could help them, but also sent us full shelter information for them. They ended up with a whole classroom and bath of their own at a local shelter. Meanwhile, from her mom’s house, Shaina recommended that we go shelter, too, because their historic bungalow is surrounded by tall trees. We took a chance and got through the night safely. Shaina even told us, the next morning, that we could stay, but we headed home."
