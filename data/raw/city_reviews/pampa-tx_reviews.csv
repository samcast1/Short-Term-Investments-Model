Stayed a few nights",This was the most comfortable Airbnb I’ve even stayed in. It was comfortable clean and so peaceful. I loved the surrounding in the country. The bed was great and just a little plus I have to get me a shower like theirs. Check in was easy. I can’t say enough good things I hope I’ll be traveling through again. I might even go out of my way to stay there. I’m not a big dog person but when I went in the back yard to see the chickens Dolly stole my heart right away. If you ever get the chance don’t miss out on staying here.

Stayed a few nights","Beds were great, comfortable, clean,!
House was very nice just like pictures, shower had an amazing shower head !
Could use a few more items in the kitchen. A few more Plates, utensils, and sharp knife would be great. We made it work since my boys have pocket knife’s 🤣.
Curb appeal needs some work. But that was not why we were there. We were in town for a family wedding so most of our time was at the there Ranch.
We needed a place our son in wheelchair could manage, two steps though the garage was manageable and yes he was able to get in the master bathroom with his chair and the hardwood floors made it very easy to maneuver and we needed a place to sleep and clean up.
BUT # 1 thing was comfortable beds and clean house I would give it 5 stars. Harold was very responsive host as well.
Would stay again if we are back in Pampa!"

The neighbors where quiet and the place felt really safe. My 10 year old son told me it was his favorite place and asked if we would please stay there again. It was a perfect fit for our family. I would highly recommend. The soaking tub was my favorite. Will will definitely be back!

I enjoyed sitting on the porch, listening to the birds, and watching the wildlife. Inside, the place is so inviting, the perfect escape from the busyness and stress of the city. The furniture was perfect for the setting and the bed was very comfortable. Nik and Dusty were so hospitable. They were great at communicating and had all kinds of clear instructions and helpful recommendations in the welcome notebook when I arrived. I'd love to visit again sometime in the future when I'm on my way to or returning from the mountains of Colorado or New Mexico."

Stayed a few nights","This is truly a special place. A charmingly converted metal barn frame in the beautiful habitat of the Texas panhandle. Many thoughtful touches with this place. Though the owners say the wireless internet is slow, we were able to stream on multiple devices with little difficulty. The bed was extremely comfortable.
But really, if you want a remote quiet place to enjoy the nature the panhandle brings, book this place immediately. Sitting out on the covered porch at sunrise and sunset is truly a magical experience. On our last night we put out some of the provided deer corn and were able to watch a very hungry, pregnant doe have a nice snack.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat."

Stayed about a week","Nik and Dusty are about as nice as you’re going to find as hosts anywhere. Communicative and caring, their home will make you feel cared for and valued, something special!
We had a wonderful time there. Peaceful, relaxing, the kitchen and all that when with it was perfect. Their electric grill was great, and being barbecue folks ourselves it went without a hitch.
The home, (“barndominium”), is very cozy yet well insulated from both cold, wind, and heat. A/C great and heaters a plenty (propane and two electric ~ and a good fan) for the ever changing weather of the Texas Panhandle! Plenty of pillows, comfortable couches, and big king-sized bed along with patio chairs to look at the stars at night and relax.
This lovely establishment is located close to both Cap Rock Canyon S.P. home of Texas’s bison herd (actually established from Charles Goodnight’s own bison stock) and the well known Palo Duro Canyon S.P. We easily traveled to both several days and hiked.
You can’t go wrong here!!"

Stayed one night","As an Airbnb superhost myself who has traveled to many other beautiful Airbnb spots around the world, I have to say this was the most unique I've ever been in. Straight to the point, if it's available book it before it's too late!
The place has the most amazing combination of modern comforts with a full kitchen, TV, very big and comfortable bed, think of sleeping on clouds (I can't stress this enough). The space is ample and can accommodate a nice size group or even just for a cozy and romantic couple. The bathroom and a nice vintage bath with a place setter for a book or a glass of wine which was a nice touch.
The outdoor balcony was one of my favorite spaces of the property with a BBQ, table and seating. The views are just pristine. I can't give this property even justice to how great it is.
I'll never forget the time I spent here and truly appreciate the attentiveness that Nik and Dusty have given and the opportunity to experience such a great and unique place!"

Stayed a few nights",Wow… incredible place. If you’re looking somewhere central for hiking Palo dura and caprock - look no more. It’s nestled in the plains about an hour from each. Well appointed cabin with all that you would need to cook meals. Bed is super comfy. Cabin is warm and fantastically decorated and open concept with small attention to details. The deer come visit every evening and morning. THE STARS at night are something not to miss. We had a crazy thunderstorm the first night and slept to the sound of rain on the metal roof. Hosts are super friendly and responsive. This is what Airbnb is all about - and Nik and Dusty are well traveled and know their craft. Thanks again for helping make Matt and my last hoorah (for awhile) so special.

The location is quiet and remote yet accessible. They warned us about rough roads, but they were not bad at all.
Additionally they left detailed information not only above the hideaway, but about the surrounding area.
Our only regret was the cloud cover at night. This would be an excellent place to star gaze."

Stayed a few nights","Fell in love with Nik & Dusty's Airbnb when I found it online, in fact I think I changed our itinerary to be able to include it.
On arrival it exceeded expectations - it was rustic, quirky & amazingly comfortable. The porch area was a lovely place to sit out at any time.
Nik & Dusty are brilliant hosts who went out of their way to solve a problem with our hire car - many thanks.
Finally, don't hesitate in booking this place as it is truly wonderful."

Stayed one night","You can only say about this place that the reviews so far are right in every way, and most importantly, the number of points reached is about how sensational this wood is.
Not only were we lucky with the weather because it was extremely windy at night, and yet we felt very safe.
After all, however, we had a wonderful sunset, and were able to enjoy it on the terrace after eating our home-cooked dinner on the same.
The bed was great, and our kids stayed on the couch and slept well there too.
Too bad we were passing through and only there one night.
Even though this place is in the entire desert, we hope to come back here one day."

Stayed one night","As before (I've stayed here 4 or 5 times), I planned the timing of my entire cross-country trip around the availability at The Hideout. It gets harder and harder to find open dates here, since this is such an awesome place in one of the most amazing settings, and word has apparently gotten out. But my experience this time was every bit as fantastic as each previous stay. Still absolutely spotless- the cleanest airbnb of my trip by far! New and lovely farm-themed art on the walls! And as always, perfectly quiet and peaceful. Nik and Dusty were fantastic hosts, again, replied to my questions immediately, and were so welcoming. I can't wait until my next chance to stay at The Hideout, assuming someone else hasn't beaten me to it!"

Traveling as two 25 year old females safety is always on your mind, we felt so safe and taken care of by Nik and Dusty. One thing I have to shout of on top of their unmatched kindness and welcoming aura is the fact that they had the lights on and AC going! You’d be surprised how common it is to get to spot for the night on road trips in unfamiliar areas and you can’t see anything and having hot flashes from carrying everything😂 Not here, we really appreciated that touch! Thank you again and I HIGHLY recommend this stay!!!"

Stayed one night","First off, I want to say that any difficulties I encountered getting to the Airbnb was 100% my fault. It was getting dark, I was in a rush, exhausted from 12 hours of driving on a 1st time solo road/moving trip, I had only quickly read the instructions and didn’t remember it exactly, only vaguely.
So I got in trouble when at Sailfish St. I turned the wrong way (following GPS — do not follow GPS here) and ended up with my van stuck in a rocky ditch at 8pm. Nik & Dusty were out of town but thankfully left Mary their mother’s number and she came to my rescue, recruiting several local friends to help me. They towed me out at no charge and fixed the damage to my car for a reasonable price. All throughout Nik and Dusty were in touch despite being away and I never felt so cared for by strangers! They were all so kind and assuring when I was so worried. So that’s just the people.
On top of that, the Airbnb itself was FABULOUS, immaculate. Howardwick is a special place, you won’t regret it!"

It was a peaceful location and a great spot to just relax. The neighborhood felt safe. Roads were a bit bumpy getting there, so following the directions they give you is definitely the best way! Make sure you sit outside at night and look at the stars for a bit - it was the most stars we’ve ever seen!"

Also they had delicious home made cookies waiting for us upon arrival which put a big smile on my face after a long drive 😍😍"

Stayed one night","This is really off the beaten path! Navigating to the location was a little tough because it's so remote not all of the roads are intact anymore. The roads are very rough, too. No problem for me in an AWD SUV, but if you have a small car low to the ground, you're in for a bumpy trip.
The barn itself is fairly nice. It's decorated in a cozy way, and because I mentioned we were traveling for my birthday they left me a nice little treat. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of insulation, and there's only a window unit A/C. We arrived on a cooler day, and the large ceiling fans were good enough. It had been very rainy, and water was seeping in at the floor. Not enough to pool, but you could see the dampness. There were also some drips coming from one spot in the ceiling near the side door. Because of this, the interior felt humid (but not uncomfortable).
Overall, this was a cute place that I enjoyed visiting. We got to watch some cute wildlife and enjoy the sound of silence."

Stayed a few nights","Nik and Dusty’s place was outstanding! As hosts, Nik and Dusty were extremely quick to respond to any messages and/or requests. The place was clean, spacious, quiet, had a well stocked kitchen, and had everything you would want for a weekend trip. The covered porch has a great overlooking view with a convenient electric grill, and the carport gives you a little ‘peace of mind’ for your vehicle in case there is bad weather. The lake is low, so it is a pretty good hike down to the shoreline, but definitely worth it. If your into fishing, it is well worth driving around to the dam side of the lake and paying the $5 per person entry fee. Overall, Nik and Dusty’s place is a 10 out 10, and I can’t wait to go back someday soon!"

If you’re visiting during colder months prepare to bundle up and cozy down in the bed. The bathroom is provided with a space heater and you’re going to want to use it. The stars are something you will never be able to get over, simply amazing!!! Everything in the house was beautiful and homey. While we didn’t feed any of the wildlife, there is an opportunity to feed the deer some corn. My absolutely favorite part was having ample amount of cooking utensils provided by our lovely hosts.

The beauty leaves you speechless at all ours of the day. Whether it’s the sunrise cup of coffee on the porch or the coyote howls in the evening, you will value this slice of Heaven. Nik and Dusty are amazing hosts and truly make you feel like you belong. It’s starts with the great cookies homemade for you as you walk into the door followed by the Texas southwest vibe your immersed in as you begin your stay then ending with if there is anything you need please don’t hesitate to ask, and truth behind it. Each time a question was asked, they were right there with an answer. If it wasn’t for them our honeymoon wouldn’t of been half of what it turned out to be and with that we now have a memory we will take with us in the start of a lifelong relationship we can always look back and a smile to. Thank you Nik and Dusty!!!!!!!! We will keep in touch as we will be coming back!!!!!!!! Also please safe travels in your own journey and if you have any recommendations for amazing travel spots reach out."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Nik and Dusty’s was such a great experience. From the detailed communication to ensure easy access to their place, to the beautiful natural environment in which the The Hideout at Old Saints Roost is situated, this was hands down one of our best Airbnb experiences ever. An excellent stop to rest and restore from the 16 hour drive between Colorado and our home in Austin. I especially loved a long soak in their claw foot tub and the star gazing once the sun set. The kids went wild for the homemade chocolate chip cookies that greeted us and immediately commandeered the king size bed. Lol.
These generous hosts share all that they love about this part of Texas with their guests, which is the thing about Airbnb that can be so special. Fun Fact: After we booked, we learned Nik and Dusty also have their own travel show on PBS called ‘Two for the Road’. We settled into their couch (which was sooooo comfy) and tuned into to watch the show on their huge smart TV while enjoying the meal we cooked in their fully stocked kitchen. We learned a lot from the episode on the Texas Panhandle where the Hideout sits. The Panhandle is a beautiful part of this huge state and it’s often underestimated and under appreciated. Out stay at the Hideout taught us just how special this part of Texas is.
Much love and respect for these cool adventurous hosts. We’ll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","If your looking for a great place to stay and enjoy the area, you need to stay at The Hideout at Old Saints Roost. Nik and Dusty kept us informed as soon as we booked the place. We were sent information about the place and detailed driving instructions since you do have to drive a ways into the neighborhood and there are limited lights if you are arriving at night. This is actually one of the things we loved about the area. At night you can enjoy nature with the sights and sounds of the country. The sitting area on the porch at night is perfect for star gazing and in the morning/evening for watching the deer and birds. Nik and Dusty have thought of everything by leaving deer corn to feed the deer, cookies for a snack upon your arrival, water, juice and breakfast for the morning, and everything in place for you to just settle in and enjoy yourselves. They even leave a binder with details about the place, things to do in the area and information about the area. We explored and took hikes to see the lake, which parts have dried up due to the drought. If you like to look for shells you can walk out onto the dried up lake bed and find some great ones. The price is also worth it with all the extras that you get and you have the entire house and patio area to enjoy your stay and especially considering the cost of the hotels in the area. The place is quiet and there are few neighbors to interrupt your stay. You won't regret choosing this place. We definitely will be back whenever we are in the area."

Stayed one night","Driving across Texas, which I do a few times a year, used to be tedious and rather dreadful, but The Hideout at Howardwick has changed this for me. Now, to the best of my ability, I plan my driving trips through Texas around availability at The Hideout, and start looking forward to the trip as soon as I've confirmed a booking there! I've definitely been spoiled by the unmatched privacy, safety, cleanliness, quiet, and extraordinary setting. After 3 stays, I've still just started to explore the 'beaches' at the lake, and the trails through the beautiful vegetation in what feels like a private nature preserve. Add to this two of the most accommodating hosts you could imagine, Nik and Dusty- thanks again to both of you! I sure hope The Hideout will be available the next time I pass through Texas!"

Communication with Nik & Dusty was quick, clear but thorough, and unfailingly friendly. Our arrival late in the evening was one of the most unique we have had at an Airbnb, between the endless starry sky, the deer poking their head out of the bushes, and the howls of coyotes filling the night. Walking into the property was a big wow. Nik & Dusty have thought of everything, and it is just the most welcoming and cozy space. While we didn’t have time to explore the area around the property, it sits in such a unique setting that we will certainly do that on our next visit.
Bottom line: everything about the experience had that magic that comes from the combination of wonderful natural hospitality, which Nik & Dusty have in spades, and the effort and attention to every little detail they clearly have put in.
I highly recommend this property!"

Stayed one night","This was such an incredible stay. When I look for what I want when booking on Airbnb, this place had it all...peace and quiet, beautiful views and an open sky for stargazing. I was not disappointed. The wild beauty of the location and watching the sunset and sunrise on the front porch was amazing and I can't even express in words how awesome it was to sit out under the night sky and see the million stars that I never have a chance to see in the city. It was very cold that night but then we got to come in and warm up by the fireplace that kept the cabin quite toasty. The place was decorated beautifully and the bed was very comfortable. It was the perfect stay to end our small trip coming back home from New Mexico. The hosts were very nice and accommodating and left us fresh baked cookies for when we arrived...and breakfast for us in the refrigerator! My husband and I loved this place and wished we could have stayed more than one night. It was very special and I highly recommend this place for anyone that wants to get away for a few days. Oh, and another plus was the sweet cat that would come visit!"

Did you see that bathtub?!?!!? Bring a bath bomb and wine! (you can borrow a book from the book exchange in the living room)
Stunning views! The view of the sunset from the front porch or the park bench on the lighted path is breathtaking and is part of what makes this part of the world famous. Bring your camera!

We loved learning about Nik and Dusty’s travel show on PBS and learning about the fascinating history of Howardwick and Saints’ Roost.
Some extras that I loved: the soaking tub (I brought Epsom salts to soak after a long day of driving); the special lights inside and out, the morning sun on the patio for doing yoga, the pure quiet of nature all around, the walk to the lake w our coffee and the noon CK out as often we are rushing to get out - so it was relaxing getting on the road.
It’s Airbnb’s like this that truly stand out above the fray. A 5 Star in the Lone Star State!"

Peaceful and quiet and so much thought put in to the smallest details! The dishes, the cow art (gotta love cow art!), the amazing and much needed bath tub, and of course, the comfy bed surrounded by tinkling lights. Just loved the decor.
The breakfast supplies were very much appreciated.
I didn't want to leave!
The setting was beautiful. The outdoors and the walk to the lake, was gorgeous. Not to mention the great sunset from the patio.

Stayed one night","This may be the most wonderful, unique and special air b&b that we've ever stayed in!! Everything - and I do mean everything - was perfect! From the minute we made our reservation Nik and Dusty made themselves available for any and all questions, and were incredibly friendly and welcoming in their communications. That alone deserves a 5 star review! And then it gets even better once you arrive. The quiet, remote location was the perfect ending to our road trip to Colorado. Sitting on that porch, watching both the sunset and sunrise, listening to the birds and frogs and crickets, and getting a morning visit from a timid deer was just what we needed before re-entering the 'real' world. And yet, we love our creature comforts too (right?)... Inside is the most comfortable, beautifully designed and appointed place we've ever stayed in. The photos are 100% accurate! Every attention to detail is met - right down to the personalized welcome book, to the homemade cookies, to the very special wedding anniversary wishes, to the full breakfast waiting to be cooked the next morning. We didn't want to leave, which means we'll definitely be back! Thanks so much Nik and Dusty! We're so happy we found your oasis!"

Every corner of the house exudes care and attention, from the meticulously chosen decor to the well-stocked cabinets filled with everything one could possibly need. Whether it's a late-night snack or a forgotten toiletry item, Carol has thought of it all, ensuring that guests feel not just welcomed, but truly cared for during their stay.
It is private, clean, and absolutely worth it! :) (She waved us goodbye, so sweetly from her porch)"

That’s what caused me to look for an alternative place to stay. What will keep me coming back? Carol and her husband are delightful. She is thoughtful in every way and a wonderful host. I ended up staying two nights and was thrilled to be back the second night! My truck battery went dead overnight the first night and Carol/her husband helped me jump my battery to get going. Another guest talked about the kitchen being stocked with food for folks who roll in late. That was true for me too—I arrived late and Carol was very accommodating but also had plenty of options for me to put something yummy together for dinner. I made pancakes! Amazing place and people! I will be back! Thank you Carol!

Stayed a few nights","Carol is a great host. She lives next door to the listing so she greeted us when we arrived and checked in. The apartment was clean and welcoming and cool because Carol had turned on the air so it would be ready for our arrival. The beds were comfy and the shower was awesome because it’s a claw foot tub with shower. The kitchen has a few snacks and coffee maker with coffee and sugar and Carol even provided a full gallon of milk in the fridge and she also supplied eggs from her chickens she has in her backyard.
Miami is a very small town and it’s the perfect setting for a relaxing holiday weekend away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. All in all Carol’s place was a great stay and I would recommend it to anyone.
I’ll certainly book again if I’m traveling through this area again."

Quiet neighborhood.The place is only 1 hour away from Amarillo which is convenient if you don’t want to stay in the city but need to go to it. And although there are local places to shop (we’re vegetarian so we couldn’t really try much lol) there is another city 20-25 min. away with major stores which is convenient for people like me who need something such as the craft store for my business or who have a specialty diet. I would highly recommend her place.

Stayed over a week","Written from Jeff and Tracey.
Carol and Mark are just the nicest! They excel in communication, they are determined to make sure your stay is excellent and that you have everything you need, and they will go above and beyond. You get farm fresh eggs 🥚 from the chickens 🐔 that run around the enclosed garden area. The garden is very large and peaceful to sit in the evening when the Texas summer temperatures cool off. There are bunnies 🐰 that you get to enjoy (not to eat but to watch lol), and the town is so quiet where you can take a walk or bike ride and not worry about speeding cars or safety. It's just wonderful! The a/c works great in the airbnb, the kitchen and bathroom are well stocked (thank you for that awesome coffee, milk, and sweetener every morning), the king bed is very comfortable, and there is the ability to have Carol do your laundry (we chose to go to Pampa and make a day outing out of it). There is a pool and park a few blocks from the airbnb and a very small but well stocked store in town for any emergency needs, and Pampa is only 30 minutes away. We truly enjoyed our time here and we are grateful we were able to stay for a few weeks while Jeff worked. Thank you!"

The bed was comfortable and Carol was kind enough to crank up the window unit before we arrived as my husband keeps our home in the 60’s. He slept great. I loved the quite town as we where trying to avoid the city of Amarillo all together on our journey North. I will venture back to Carol’s place in Miami anytime we have need to travel through (Zoe really avoid) Amarillo. Well worth venturing off the beaten path. I loved the Apricot tree out front as well. Everything was a charming surprise for the value.

(The pics in the listing far underrate the value as other reviews pointed out). I loved how remote Miami is, nestled between vast Texas farmland and beautiful cap-rocks. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a restorative and soul nourishing adventure."

Stayed one night","Our stay was great! Everything was setup so nice for us, and the apartment was so clean! We met Carol and she is such a nice person! The only thing negative that I feel I need to add is that although the Airbnb listing stated that breakfast was served, this is not the case, and was a little misleading. It stated that breakfast is provided by request under ""the space"" and is also listed under Amenities for dining as ""breakfast is provided"". This was one of the main reasons we choose a bed and breakfast over a hotel/motel. Carol did recommend a fantastic cafe (The Sage Matt) where we had our breakfast the next morning...it was great! All-in-all, this was a very nice experience and we both would like to thank you again, Carol."

Outdoor deck so lovely & fantastic 2 get some important sun for me & my service animals. Since I’m in a power wheelchair & manual wheelchair, the long wheelchair ramp is a huge help 2 me. House decor is pretty & comfortable elegance but yet fits in with pretty outdoors. When I was being abused by the male driver that was supposed 2 help load & transport my animals, supplies & wheelchairs 2 next Airbnb,I was thankful that Lauri & husband showed up & helped me feel safer (I’m a victim of major crimes & so are my service animals) &they helped take out my belongings so driver Randy would then load it up in vehicles. Laurie & her husband were complementary of me & made me feel safer with the situation. During my stay they contacted me & asked me if I need anything from town or 2 hall off trash etc. They are kind, sweet & easy 2 talk with. Pretty area/place.

Lauri was more than accommodating, offering her house early to us. Of the 8 houses we’ve been at this trip, Lauri is hands down our favorite host!
We also experienced wind like I’ve never experienced before. We chased $93 a man let fly away as lost because it moved too fast across a highway. I felt like my 5 year old was going to fly away if she let go of my hand. The bunker next to the entrance was a huge relief to someone like me… inexperienced in tornadoes (it was just wind and not a tornado).
Aside from all that the house was clean and comfortable. Would definitely book again!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was very pleasant. Plenty of room for all the family. Spent early Christmas with family and had plenty of room even for the little ones. Might want to invest in a few more kitchen essentials, like pots and pans and mixing bowls. Because mixing 12 eggs in a single cereal bowl was difficult. over all the stay was perfect."

Group trip","The location was very peaceful and private. The cabin was nicely decorated and clean. The building is rather old and has a musty smell throughout. But, it was definitely not dirty at all. The beds were very comfortable with fresh smelling clean linens. There was no outdoor trash receptacle to put bags taken out from the kitchen. We were told to just leave them on the porch and I was afraid animals were going to get into the bags.
Would benefit from large outside trash bin.
The appliances in the kitchen were on the newer side and fully functional/clean, however ... the other kitchen equipment available..... mixing bowls, pots and pans, cooking utensils were very lacking and some not in good shape. All in all....we would stay here again and was a decent value for the cost. Just probably bring some of your own kitchen equipment if u plan to do much cooking onsite."

The home was beautiful decorated. I liked the thought behind small details like the kitchen cabinet handles were deer, or the knobs in the bathroom were fish. Snacks were absolutely appreciated. Each room was decorated perfectly, and everything was so clean. We very much enjoyed our stay and wishes we were staying longer than just one night. Lauiri's place exceeded my expectations, by far."

Our trip got off to a rough start (caught someone trying to break into our U-Haul, then someone smashed our rearview mirror 5 mins before we were supposed to leave) so we had to adjust our plans and Lauri was extremely accommodating and made a very stressful situation much better. It also didn't hurt arriving to home made cookies and wide open spaces for our dogs! Highly recommend this home for your stay :)"

Stayed with a pet","This is a great house not far at all from the Interstate, but located in a peaceful setting with lots of space. Ramp makes it easy to offload your luggage. On a cold day the wall heater makes the place cozy. Well equipped large kitchen and lots of room if you have a large party. Host was responsive and it was a nice place to stop on my trip. I didn't go to the lake but it wasn't far. Nice sunset!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed here on our way to go skiing. Super clean, with everything you need. Communication and check-in was great. The kids loved the bunk beds, they each claimed a top bunk and played with their ipads.
Fantastic views of the night skies from the large deck, and the lonesome song of the coyotes took me back in time. I will stay here again.

Stayed with kids","Staying at the Pine Shed felt like staying with a friend who wasn’t there. It was early evening on a crisp winter day when we arrived. The house was warm, inviting and smelled amazing. We came prepared with food for the weekend and had everything we needed in the kitchen. And the grill was great for burgers and steaks (that we picked up at Sunrise Convenience Store). The place was peaceful and our time was restful. It really made for a great getaway for us!"

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at the Pine Shed! The place was comfy and had everything we needed for our quick overnight stay alone a road trip! Our toddlers had room for their packnplays in one of the bunk rooms, which allowed us some adult time after their bedtime which was really nice. We cooked an awesome dinner and the kitchen was fully stocked with all the tools and utensils, even for the kiddos. The fresh cookies that were left for us really hit the spot. We will definitely stop by again and wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the beautiful deck and even lake. Thank you for the great experience, Lauri."

We've stayed here multiple times and appreciate the owner's consistency and attention to detail. There are very few lodging options in this area -- this one is a keeper. Also highly recommend Jinda Cafe - a Lao/Thai restaurant run by a lovely family on Highway 287 in nearby Clarendon, TX. Order ahead, the food is terrific and fresh! They even have a drivethru for pickup..."

We were literally only there for one night(traveling cross country) but it was the nicest place I stayed the entire trip. House is huge and could fit a family no problem. And a bonus is Lauri makes you baked goods that are waiting for you when you arrive! Only place I would stay at the tip of Texas!

My wife is so picky and OCD about cleanliness, especially about bathrooms, and she is still talking about how amazing the shower was! Host went above and beyond, and even gifted my wife a special something for our wedding anniversary! The pool table was the perfect addition to the experience. The greenhouse directly next to the home is an aesthetically pleasing feature that we enjoyed walking through! The flowers were almost as gorgeous as my wife! Overall, the home surpassed all expectations and it felt like a home away from home. We are immensely grateful to the host for providing this amazing experience! We hope to return again soon."
