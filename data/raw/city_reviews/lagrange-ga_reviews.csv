Beds were the most comfortable we've slept in...and so are the couches. This is the kind of place you want to just move into and live in forever."

Right out the door we could run a local path to the park, explore the cute downtown, shop and eat. We definitely want to stay again!"

I would like to make a STRONG recommendation, that you place black out curtains in the master bedroom. I was not able to sleep in that room the entire trip due t the BLAIRING lights that come into the room all night and morning. Having an option to close a curtain would have been extremely helpful as it is so bright in that room."

Stayed a few nights","The Loft was a great place to stay, right on the main square in downtown LaGrange. The Loft has an open floor plan with high ceilings and plenty of space to spread out and relax. A note for those who are light sleepers (and not in any way a negative review on the our stay). Trash pickup on the Square occurred at 4 am one morning. On another morning, street sweepers went by 4x at 3 am and then the gardening staff mowed and edged the lawn as well as cut the hedges in the Square at 4 am on the same morning. Despite this, we enjoyed our stay in the Loft and would definitely stay there again."

Stayed with kids","The place was fine. It was very clean and well decorated.
The house does not have a TV. Granted a TV was not listed in the amenities, but in 2024 I feel like at least one TV is a given. Also the hot water heater is too small for the house two out of three of us took unexpected cold plunges in the morning. Very trendy right now I know, but not the experience I was hoping for in my Airbnb shower. Lastly the linens, towels, sheets, and pillows, were very poor quality.
It fit our needs for the night, but we will not be back for our next stay."

Stayed one night","Great location for what we wanted, great set up as far as the interior and exterior of the home. The furniture and decor was very nice and modern, would be great for a photo shoot. ONLY COMPLAINTS- there is not blinds or curtains for all the windows; it’s in a good location but still on a main road and has neighbors, there is a slight step up to the front entrance that can be dangerous for clumsy people or someone not paying attention; maybe paint it orange or black to make it noticeable, and no tv; I get it getting away and relaxing leaving technology behind but it would have been nice to have one even if small and wall mounted. Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves; bed was super comfy and the couch in the living room as well. Parking was easy and the outside fire pit really adds a nice touch."

Now I’ve stayed in pet friendly homes before and there’s normally smell like there’s been an animal in the home but this place smelled amazing. It was super clean and they had items in the house I didn’t even know I needed. Plus it’s less than 5 minutes away from Great Wolf Lodge so 10/10
Our host was sweet and responded timely"

The deck out front is a comfortable spot to have coffee and enjoy the view. The dock is peaceful: I sat in a chair and read a book and listened to the fish jumping.
The lake and surroundings are beautiful.
The host, Vivian, has provided ample amenities: coffee and all that is needed to suit your tastes, mini-fridge, bottles of chilled water, TV with Roku that signs you out of your accounts at the end of your stay, microwave, towels (including for a swim in the lake), and more.
IMPORTANT: The bed is comfy. (I have back problems, and I was comfy.)
In short, you certainly will enjoy your stay."

The property was clean and there were so many thoughtful accommodations inside. We were very comfortable there and we know that anyone looking to have a weekend away from busyness and city life will definitely enjoy this stay.

Stayed a few nights","Very nice guest house with a beautiful view. The lake was peaceful and the bed was amazing.
We saw there was no kitchen but missed the part where guests could not bring their own stove or grill. We packed a stove and all our food so when we checked in and went to cook, we were pretty bummed. Every meal we had to pack up, drive somewhere, cook and eat. The host made this clear, it was just buried down in the house rules and I missed it. Wish it had been posted higher up but it’s my fault!
Hosts were very kind and welcoming and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, quiet getaway."

Accommodations were exactly as described. If you aren’t planning a trip to relax , eat out and enjoy finding the cool spots in this cute little town , then maybe this isn’t your rental.
Bed was super comfy, spacious bathroom and plenty of room in the converted boat house! 🥰
We were able to paddle out on the lake ( low traffic and super quiet! ) and find several beach area including a public one for swimming within ten minutes of the dock.
Wonderful family and if your lucky you might even get to met their sweet three legged girl Lucy.
Most definitely recommend and will plan a stay again!

Stayed with kids",Maya has a beautiful home and it is very well maintained with plenty of linens and things to do. It was great having the games and ping pong table for the children. My only complaint was the noise. Apparently there was some event in a park area which was almost directly behind the home and it started early. There were also trains running all night long using their horns coming through the intersections. It made for sleepless nights. But if this doesn't bother you - it is a great place to stay.

The only slight negative, isn’t something the host can control. At night we could hear the horns of freight trains in the distance. It only seemed to affect very light sleepers in our group. I slept fine.

Stayed with kids","I started planning a trip for the Great Wolf Waterpark but we wanted full amenities- mainly full kitchen. I found this lovely home located less than 10 minutes away so we booked it after seeing the reviews for this location and Maya’s as a super host. She was in fact awesome. Sent us all details needed for the trip in advance. Our first day we played ping pong/other games at the property. We spent the next day at the water park, came back for lunch and then finished off with a lovely dinner outside. The neighborhood didn’t have a lot of traffic. It is located near a railway but It wasn’t obnoxiously loud. We had two adults, two teens, and a 6 year old for this trip. We were so comfortable and relaxed. Beds slept amazing. It was colder temps when we arrived and the heat/ac was perfect. Communication is key with one restroom and we made it work. It was half the cost of staying at the GW lodge plus we saved with food cost. Over all this was a major hit. 10/10 Maya and Property"

The neighborhood was quiet. Our family had an absolutely wonderful stay in Maya’s home. I mostly appreciated her quick communication. The linens and pillows were fabulous. The home has a very well stocked kitchen. The board games was a family favorite. I can’t recommend this place highly enough. A stay to remember! Thank you so much! 😊"

I simply cannot say enough about how wonderful our visit was! David was very responsive, even came to help us within 5 minutes upon our arrival, and super accommodating to our requests.
The house was spotless, with a kitchen equipped for all of our needs. The bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival was an excellent touch after a 12 hour drive to get from Texas! My favorite spots in the house were the screened in porch (coffee in the mornings with a beautiful view of the lake ❤️), the master bathroom (amazing space and the shower was everyone’s favorite) and finally the billiard room (lots of use from our family!).
We would absolutely stay here again!"

The master suite is delightful; comfortable bed, impressive shower, and vanities. Again, it was so nice to have such a lovely place to prepare for wedding festivities. The entire house was clean, spacious and so comfortable. I would highly recommend this venue and hope to return one day for a vacation.
A must stay!

Group trip","I originally booked this place because it was easy to get to from Atlanta (less than an hour and a half from midtown), spacious (3 king beds, 1 queen bed, all in separate rooms) and had easy access to a private dock sitting on the lake, as well as downtown LaGrange. Not only did all of these features turn out to be true, the home was also lovely with giant windows viewing the lake, huge with 3 separate sitting areas and a kitchen that comfortably hosted me and my seven guests as we took turns cooking and chatting, luxurious with a master bedroom that had an apartment sized bathroom with both a giant tub and a shower/sauna that could house a football team, and filled with amenities from a full sized tennis court to a billiards room that is bigger than most people's living room. In addition, the host was super easy to work with, very responsive, and generally easy to talk to. Could not recommend this place more!"

Our annual veterans trip was a success and we were blown away with the homes amenities! David is so kind, helpful and a pleasure to work with. 3 days was not enough to enjoy what this place has to offer for all ages!
A quiet cove, ideal fishing, well appointed kitchen for large meals, the billiards room and optional other rooms gave everyone space to be comfortable all day. We spent a great deal of time exploring wildlife and rocks around the cove, swinging on the porch while grilling, enjoying stories with belly aching laugher to resolve with a comfortable night's rest after amazing custom showers! A+, 100%, This home does not disappoint!!!!"

It was the perfect place for a peaceful and relaxing trip to the lake. We also loved how close it was to downtown LaGrange’s restaurants and breweries.
David was a great host and answered all the questions we had promptly. He left a guide to the area which was very helpful. Communication from check in to check out was easy. was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures
I would 100% recommend a stay here. We hope we can find time to stay again in the future."

My husband and daughter also enjoyed the well-stocked game shelf in the living room. Bedrooms are large with walk-in closets and comfortable beds. The bathrooms were beautiful. The kitchen is well appointed. I must give special attention to the design and lighting scheme along the concrete driveway and outside the home. This required vision (and a lot of work) to create such an inviting ambience! Even the walk path down to the dock (by far the finest we saw) has been carefully and thoughtfully maintained. It is steep in some areas so wear good shoes. It's well worth the walk to see and enjoy the lake, which was blissfully quiet. An osprey stopped by to showoff his aerial skills before snatching its prey from the cool water and flying off to enjoy his lunch. Highly recommend this lovely home and peaceful setting!"

The dock is a pretty steep walk, but it rained all weekend so we enjoyed the “flamingo lounge” during nap time without worry of waking the babies! We tried out the grill and do feel the outdoor space is deserving of a good grill, compared to what’s there- but it did the job! Maya was fantastic with responding and being so helpful!"

Charles was helpful, friendly and responsive. the building is some 10 yards fromthe main house and other homes on the street, whichis on the drive to the Hills and Dale's gardens, making it lovely and also near the college campus so quote walkable. we were glad to have our little dogs with us. The media room is full of curious and historical family treasures and there are plenty of tvs and furniture. Things were clean and the very small ""kitchen"" stocked with water and coffee. I would have liked more kitchen counter space and a sink in the same room, so we wound up eating out more than we planned.
Overall, quite novel and fascinating while clean and comfortable. The small, historical building gives a farmhouse feel to the experience of being on someone's manor."

Stayed with a pet","There was no AC. It was almost 80 degrees when we got there at 4pm, so we turned it to 70 and went to dinner. We also cleaned up a bunch of dead bugs on the carpet. The host came and said nothing was wrong with the AC, but it kept sitting at 77 to 75 for hrs, & we felt no air from the vents. I assumed it only cooled a few degrees because it was night time. So, we called AirBNB. The host then said it would be sometime the next day, and we could wait on workmen to fix it. We then packed up and left driving 4hrs home to Columbia SC, covered in heat rash, at 10pm at night. The final temp was 77°. Callaway Gardens still is refusing to refund our tickets we purchased online (roughly 78$), & AirBNB could not find us comparable accomodations. They did inform us that the AC not working had been mentioned by another person staying at this location (after the fact in a complaint), so check that the AC is working before unpacking, & call AIRBNB immediately, or you won't get your money back."

We absolutely feel blessed for this being our first time using AirBnB and encountering this gem. For a ""Couple+small senior dog"", this is a drive-plus10-hrs-destination-for-a-5-day-stay MUST experience. We spent hours admiring the place when we first arrived, we felt both at-home but also on a movie set (no other way to describe it). I honestly wished I could spend a week, dare I say month, here. Remember the proper light switch for the Keurig, be sure to set aside time for moments for yourself at the piano, bring your favorite chilled beverages (there is plenty of room), and absolutely spend 8 minutes in ""the chair"" on setting B while watching an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond. You will leave better than you arrived.
Heaven, will do again, 10 out of 10."

It’s located in a beautiful neighborhood and only steps away from the historic Hills and Dales estate which is well worth a visit. The cottage offers a clean and interesting setting with a comfortable bed, good WiFi, and several tv options including Netflix.
It’s also a quiet neighborhood so peaceful sleep is likely!
Charles provides bottled water, sodas, and coffee in the dorm style kitchen which has a microwave and small refrigerator. He also responds promptly to any questions. One of his tips I followed was dining at Mare Sol on Main Street. Delicious meal of braised pork shanks and a great beer selection. The menu offered many good choices.
My dog and I had a fine visit and enjoyed the friendliness of everyone we met in LaGrange."

The neighborhood was very quiet so my family and I were able to sleep and relax as we pleased. But when we wanted to go out there was plenty to do and see. The perfect balance.
The part I found most comforting was that Charles was VERY responsive. Whenever I messaged him he answered quickly and was VERY kind! I also very much appreciated the flexibility of the check in and more importantly the check out times. I traveled with my elderly parents and checking out at 11am is difficult to do with them. The flexibility of checkout gave me one less thing to stress about.
Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this place."

There was coffee and other munchies supplied by the host which was such a thoughtful touch. There is a very large walk in closet and plenty of drawer space. We very much enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning when we have more time to explore the LaGrange area.

Stayed one night","Charles' home was perfect for the nature of our trip- a quick and spontaneous weekend adventure. It was about an easy, hour-long drive to Atlanta, which we did the first day. The second day we went hiking in Pine Mountain (FDR State Park) and that was about a 45 minute commute as well. The location of Charles' home is ideal for someone looking for a quaint and beautiful place to stay for 2-3 people, but be prepared to drive a bit if you plan on going anywhere outside of LaGrange. The only drawback was that it was quite dusty on the inside and not very clean in the living room, but I will say that the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and neat. We would definitely stay here again if we ever ventured back to LaGrange!"

It is a work in progress, which we knew going in. This AirBnb is a good option if you are looking in this area for a quiet, uncluttered place to get a good night's sleep."

The bottle of wine, fire log, and snacks were a nice touch and were fully consumed! We renewed our marriage vows under the canopy of trees near the lake and it was the perfect setting. We definitely plan on returning next year - perhaps in the spring. Our stay there exceeded our expectations. It was a wonderful weekend."

It was chilly at night and Roy proactively asked if they needed to bring a space heater!
The kitchen had all I needed. The shower is a dream. And the sofa and bed were so comfortable I hated to leave!
Don’t hesitate to make this your home away from home!"

The cabin felt brand new, had everything we needed, beds were comfortable, the decor was tasteful, the kayaks were such a blessing. I could live there. I highly recommend it! Roy thought of everything. The wine, mini toiletries, chocolate, coffee and popcorn. He left a starter fire log in case we needed it but we had plenty of pine needles, twigs and wood to have a nice fire in the fire pit to have our s’mores. Fabulous place! So clean, odor free. Answered all of my questions, and I can be annoying.
We hated to leave. Please stay at Roy’s! If we are ever back in the area we will! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Carol's place should be renamed Pearson Pines Perfection. It surpassed all our expectations. The property is better in person than in the photos, with beautifully maintained grounds and a tastefully decorated interior. Every room was immaculate and thoughtfully appointed.
The beds were comfy, and everyone slept great. We cooked several full meals for the family, and the kitchen had everything we needed. Thoughtful touches like clearly labeled switches and appliances made the home easy to navigate. The wifi was strong and consistent. They do request that you leave your shoes at the door, so it might be a good idea to pack some slippers in cooler months.
Carol was a joy to work with. Her proactive approach was evident when she swiftly resolved a minor booking issue for us (from the Airbnb side), displaying grace and professionalism.
This was truly the best Airbnb we've encountered to date -- perfect for our family! Thank you, Carol."

It was easy to prepare all our meals in the well-appointed kitchen. The laundry closet had a state-of-the-art washer/dryer as well. The bathrooms are luxurious with everything we needed.

I stayed by myself and left feeling very tranquil from the breathtaking views. There was plenty of room for my family which I plan to bring next time that I come. Day 1: I ordered food and on day 2: I drove a few minutes up the road to Calloway Gardens for the Spring Festival and take out and came back as quickly as possible in order to continue to enjoy the space.
This is a stay that I will not soon forget!"

What makes this place SUPER special is the BACK YARD with the beautiful wooded area and a private access to the lake. Pictures of the listing do not justify this beauty, so you have to come here and personally experience it. To describe his back yard with one word - SERENITY (from the dusk to the dawn). Pure heaven!!! David was extremely quick to respond to our questions (via SMS) about the grocery shopping etc. I am grateful to the previous reviewer who mentioned the neighbor's large unleashed dogs because they surrounded our car when we first arrived at David's house. They are so cute and friendly, so please do NOT be afraid of them bc they only crave to be pat by anybody After sniffing you upon arrival, they will definitely not bother you again; you will even feel secured knowing that they are near you to protect you. My 8 year son was so trilled to see them around."

Stayed a few nights","We had a phenomenal stay! It’s super close to Atlanta but really nice and secluded. We made use of the backporch, the wonderful open living room, and the short stroll to the lake. We are able to enjoy tranquil sunrises, beautiful sunsets, and starry night skies. I’d definitely recommend David’s place!!"

Stayed a few nights","If you would like to experience a little piece of heaven, go to David's place!! The home is spacious, clean, homelike, and nestled in a lovely wooded area with a view of the lake. You are truly one with nature! The path leading to the lake is so pretty - at the first of the path are stones and landscaping. I loved sitting on the little private beach area listening to the birds sing - so relaxing!! Also enjoyed exploring the lake with my son, on the kayak. David's place has special touches that make you feel at home - we loved lighting the candles, and loved the decorative lights on the deck. The kitchen is extremely well stocked - perfect for cooking all your meals while there. There are also 2 very sweet dogs that came to visit us routinely (from next door) and accompanied us on our walks to the lake. These dogs are large, but so gentle! The checkim-in / out process We will definitely be going back"

Stayed a few nights","This place is breath taking ! The lake is unexplainable . It’s so relaxing, so calming and a much needed get away
. If I had to rate this place on a scale of 1-10 I couldn’t, I’d need a larger scale!
David, was kind, informative, responsive ! I recommend this place to EVERYONE ! I enjoyed it so much I didn’t touch my phone Unless it was to take a photo of the scenery to seize the moment!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved David’s place! David was always quick to reply and very accommodating.
The view from the lake was stunning. We also loved the layout of the house. It was perfect for socializing and made for a wonderful weekend getaway. We cooked a lot and the kitchen had everything we needed.
The neighbor’s dogs also were so sweet and made for some fun extra company! Can’t wait to be back!"

Stayed with kids","We had a lovely weekend and the communication with David was great. The location is unique and very quiet! It can sometimes be disturbed by the many boats and jet skis on the lake. The house has everything you need and more!
We wished there were more work space in the kitchen and the beds were too soft for us! But that depends on your needs.😃 Thank you very much!!"

Stayed with kids",We absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful oasis. It was such a peaceful place to relax. The home had everything we needed and more. We loved being on the lake and spent every afternoon out there on the dock. It is the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of life. We would definitely love to stay here again.

Stayed with a pet","This waterfront home was comfortable, peaceful, and everything I was looking for. The home had countless thoughtful touches like: fishing poles, spotlight, blankets, fluffy towels for both the shower and the lake, paper plates, coffee, trash bags… It would take a long time to list all the extra touches that we were grateful for and not expecting to find. The home is beautiful, clean, and pet friendly. We hope to stay again soon."

Stayed with kids",This was an amazing place to stay! Had everything you need for an enjoyable and relaxing vacation. We were able to bring our boat and had a blast fishing. Our kids really enjoyed their spring break. David was very helpful and quick to answer any questions. Would highly recommend this place!
