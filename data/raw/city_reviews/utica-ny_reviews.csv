The AirBnB looked exactly as it had been pictured and described. Nick was proactive in making sure that we were ready to check in and was available to answer any questions we had during our stay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","It was a very good apartment for me to stay in. There is a very good pizza restaurant on the first floor with very good food and the owner and employees are great to talk with. Short walk to other great restaurants and pubs. Overnight parking was a short walk away. Antonina was very responsive and followed up very quickly to a few questions.
If you are looking for a comfortable stay while in Utica, I recommend this apartment. Very clean and comfortable and I felt I was in a safe community. Just keep in mind, the apartment is in a city, it is a walk up, there are stairs, and there are other people who live in the floor above. Normal things you will encounter when living in the city."

Stayed a few nights","The loft is very nicely done, spacious, comfortable, and super clean. And in a great area. Antonina was very responsive—Unfortunately she was responsive because of her absurdly loud upstairs neighbor, who decided to vacuum at 11pm, then stay up until 4am, loudly moving about. She was tremendously apologetic and even gave us a discount (that we didn’t ask for, so that was nice). So if you’re sensitive to noise or go to bed early, I’d suggest earplugs in case the neighbor is around. Otherwise the place was great."

Stayed with a pet","My husband used to work in Utica & stayed very close to where this apartment is located, so we already knew the area well. Our host was extremely responsive & proactive. I felt catered-to, honestly.
The apartment looked just like the photos, and we truly enjoyed our stay! We had our dog with us, and she was entertained both while we were there and I suspect while we were away, thanks to the exact position of the bed next to the windows. She loved the ability to look out the window, and if the dog's happy, everyone is happy!
We had been on the road a lot the last couple of days, and Antonina's place was like an oasis for us weary travelers: Comfortable, clean, accommodating, and a very upscale feeling. No details were left out from the furniture to the bedding to the faucets and decor. I wasn't going to wash my hair until I got home, but then stepped into that shower & just had to when I saw the shampoo and conditioner!
Thank you for such a lovely stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Antonia’s place is in a great location - walkable to 2 great coffee shops and one of the best dinners I’ve eaten ANYWHERE in a really long time (Tailor & the Cook). The pizza place also a delicious lunch spot with super friendly staff.
Perhaps because we stayed in the winter, we didn’t experience any of the loud outside house mentioned in other reviews. It was quiet at night other than regular traffic noises. And we didn’t find the music from the pizza place very loud at all (and does turn off around 10PM); perhaps the play it more loudly during the summer?
The place was super clean, beautifully decorated, and the wifi was speedy!
Comfortable bed; plenty of towels and very nice products in the bathroom!
If you are planning on doing a lot of cooking, just know that the kitchen is stocked with (nice) basics, but you might need to procure some other items.
Antonia was friendly, super responsive, and helpful! Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great host, very responsive. We stayed during a cold spell after Christmas and the apartment was warm. We were able to adjust heat ourselves. Apartment is what you would consider a quintessential Airbnb. Clean, snacks, small knickknacks, no clutter, sparse cupboards, clean efficient bathroom, spotless fridge and kitchen, large tv with all the streamers. Overall wonderful stay!
Some notes: needs warming up with rugs and/or pillows. The upstairs neighbors are very active at night (8p-4a) and they like to stomp, bang, run, talk loudly. The sound echos in the apartment because there aren’t fabrics to absorb the sound. The speaker outside the pizza place is obnoxious. It blasted music until 10:30p.
Location: The neighborhood isn’t quite there yet and feels a little unsafe. We did eat at The Tailor and the Cook (very good) and had coffee at Utica coffee (ok)."

Stayed a few nights","This studio apartment was very clean, welcoming, and well decorated! It is located very close to many things and we could walk to coffee and dinner very close by. Because of this, I would love to give the place 5 stars…however, it was incredibly loud outside the apartment (the windows face the street) throughout both nights we were there. We stayed there in the month of July and the weather was really nice, so maybe people were out on the street more than usual. Sadly, there were people partying until all hours of the morning on the sidewalk below. Notably, there is a gentleman’s club below the apartment (that may or may not be closed) that may have led to an increased number of folks outside.
In addition, there is a pizza place under the apartment that has a speaker facing the sidewalk. They were playing the music very loud until 10pm. Finally, there are apartments above and below this property, and you can hear people walking and dogs barking.
We’ve stayed (and live) in urban areas, but this felt unusually loud. If this kind of thing doesn’t bother you, you should stay here! It is a really great apartment aside from all the noise."

There is a downtown type ambiance with sounds from neighbors and music from the surrounding restaurants, but for us, it was nice. It is on the third floor and not handicap accessible, but if you’re able to make a few flights of stairs, Antonina’s loft is an amazing place to spend time at."

The bed is comfortable with lots of pillows and extra blankets. It is on a fun strip with a great coffee shop. There are a lot of stairs to get to the apartment and, being in the middle of the action, it isn’t very quiet. Antonina was a very responsive host and the whole experience was completely enjoyable."

The apartment is beautifully decorated, and has everything needed. Antonina is very thoughtful. Even had green plants, coffee/tea bags/Keurig machine, and bowlful of snacks waiting for us. Truly home away from home.
Pros:
- extremely comfortable bed
- shower is amazing. Great water pressure
- huge TV with Netflix and Disney already installed and logged in
- downstairs are the city’s best coffee shop (Utica Roasting Co), best pizza (Johnny’s), and best fine dining (Tailor and Cooks). We are foodies, and we were in heaven.
Cons:
- not handicap accessible. Not an issue for us, but would not be a good fit for people can’t walk up stairs."

Stayed a few nights","If you're staying in Utica this is the perfect location. Situated one block from the train station it is walking distance from downtown and literally right above a gourmet restaurant, a great coffee shop, and little local pizza joint. A one block walk will find you at the cool Baggs Square Brewery and less than a mile walk will get you to the fun restaurants and pubs and nightlife along Varick Street.
As for the room it was impeccably clean and very well appointed with some nice amenities like plenty of local coffee and some light snacks and gourmet candies. It is secure and private and very spacious and has everything you could need for a one night stay or a full extended stay.
The only concern for some (though I kind of liked it) was the cliched Italian music wafting up from the pizza joint two stories below. It is a bit loud and could be a problem for some if you go to sleep early. But by 11 PM it was dead quiet up there.
I for sure will stay here again if I can next time I find myself in Utica."

Laura is the most thoughtful SUPER Host I’ve met thus far. Don’t worry if you forget any cosmetics at home, because Laura’s place comes equip with all the small things you can easily forget at home.
Laura’s place will definitely be my go to when I’m in Utica.
Laura, thanks for such a great experience."

Stayed a few nights","Laura is INCREDIBLE. She is the absolute BEST host I've ever had on airbnb or anywhere else. She was so responsive, went ABOVE AND BEYOND, became almost like family and her home a ""home away from home."" I absolutely adore Laura and wouldn't stay anywhere else when I'm in Utica. Her home is the only place I would ever stay when I return. Not booking with her is a MISTAKE. RUN DON'T WALK and stay in her cozy airbnbs.
Thanks Laura <3"

There was nothing that was not provided, which was great for a 2 day stay, and when you don't have time to fuss with a trip to the store. Lots of nice restaurants in the area to choose from. Definitely a 5 star stay!"

Laura is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She provided me with all the information we needed and showed me around. The penthouse is just perfect! The kitchen is a modern and beautiful design that contains everything one needs, plus! The beds were comfortable. The living room furniture was cozy. Bathrooms are excellent. Location is incredible. Communication was great too.
Laura was extremely welcoming and was of great help. She went way beyond to make my weekend comfortable and memorable. I have already (highly) recommended Laura’s penthouse to friends and I am looking forward to the next time I can stay!"

Laura is a phenomenal host. Her apartment is beautifully decorated and kitted out with any amenity you could imagine. She really pays attention to the details. She followed up after we checked in and made sure that there were fun things for our 11 year old to do. We enjoyed waking up and tasting local Utica favorites while sipping espresso.
We'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Utica!"

Stayed with kids","The inside of this place was absolutely immaculate, the cleaning service didn’t just clean. They deep clean. The kitchen was extremely functionable. We were able to save money by making them majority of our meals in the home. I took my 11-year-old son with me and we got to watch my cousin play for the USA women’s national hockey team And had a really good time. I was ‘that guy’ and asked a lot of questions and got extremely fast responses. The location is very close to downtown Utica about 3 minutes by car, no highways. The beds were comfortable and the linens and towels were very clean , well kept bathroom. I packed my son‘s PlayStation and the seating in the family room was also very comfortable with cupholders and we enjoyed some bonding comfortably together in that room. I did have a small concern, when it was brought up, it was handled immediately and satisfied. I am a small business owner, and it was nice to see how they handled this situation ethically as I would have done. :)"

Main floor spacious, comfortable rooms; everyone had a different spot in the mornings to sit and enjoy coffee and check their scocial media. WIFI was good.
Kitchen and pantry have everything you would need. Robby even left some Utica coffee for us to try Delicious! Bed linens, towels and pillows are all high quality and beds very comfortable. Ensuites off bedrooms, all with showers and lots of hot water.
House is located in older section near downtown where several revitalization projects are going on. It is in a mixed neighbourhood but we did not feel unsafe and sat on front porch and in backyard on the nice days. It was a five minute drive to the arena and about the same for other attractions in Utica."

Stayed with kids","I was born in Utica and even though we haven't lived in Utica for over 40 years, have spent almost every Christmas. Now that our own children are married with children, we needed a place to be comfortable to just hang out before seeing both sides of the family...this was the perfect place. The bedrooms are sooo comfortable and luxurious that I felt like I was in a five star hotel.
I was able to cook dinner for our family of 8. The stove was so clean I almost hated to use it. The refrigerator was very spacious and we had a LOT of food to fill it. The dining room is enormous and we had a couple of meals there. TV and living rooms were really comfy to hang out in also.
There was enough hot water for all of us to shower and the bathrooms are very comfortable.
As far as the area, we never felt unsafe and my husband even found a playground two houses away for my 3 year old grandson to play in. Too many plusses to name. I could go on and on."

The house is beautifully restored and represents an art piece more than a home. The interior exerted a modern twist to its historical structure. It is cozy and spotless. I have never seen an airbnb this clean before and can tell how much effort Robby has put into the home. He was super accommodating to my request to check out later due to an event at my university. There was a lot of space in the home and allowed pets. I had booked this airbnb last minute and Robby took the time to meet me at the airbnb to give me a tour. He is very passionate about his work and always strives to improve his guests’ experience. The hospitality Robby has shown cannot be compared to previous experiences. I would definitely come back the next time I am around this area!"

Stayed with kids","Robby’s place was amazing! The pictures do not do it justice. It is a beautifully restored and decorated historic home that is bigger and better than it appears on the listing. It has gorgeous woodwork and built-ins throughout. The floors were a bit squeaky, but that’s because they are original wood floors with lovely details, so we didn’t mind it. The immediate neighborhood is not great and needs a little love and attention. However, we felt very safe the whole time we were there and found good places for food shopping and dining out just 5-10 minutes away by car. They also had a fully-stocked kitchen with everything you can think of, so we easily made some homemade meals.
Robby was very friendly, responsive and accommodating. It seems he thought of every possible detail to make our stay wonderful. It was perfect for our multigenerational family, and we look forward to booking this place again whenever we are in the area. This is one of the best AirBnB stays we’ve ever had!"

The house is impeccable, the neighborhood has some work in terms of feeling safe to walk at night. I never felt unsafe though. There's so much attention to detail, down to coffee makers, first aid kit, and soap. There is enough space for a larger party to spread out VERY comfortably. The beds were crazy comfortable. And Robby was available very easily. I think he was actually concerned that he hadn't heard from ME more, but the accommodations were so great and everything already attended to that I didn't have a need! I wouldn't hesitate on this if it is available for your dates of travel."

He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. The house is so spacious that it could accommodate even more people and still be comfortable."

The house is gorgeously renovated and well stocked with the advertised amenities. Robby greeted us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the house and was very responsive and accommodating throughout our stay. Would definitely stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","This was by far the best AirBnB experience I've had. The pictures do not do this place justice. Every room had a new charm and beautiful craftsmanship. My favorite room was the linen closet room! I never wanted to leave. The pictures all over the house show the care taken to restore the house to its former glory. My friends and I were curling in a tournament that weekend and ended up showing multiple other teams the house because we were so blown away. Each bathroom had its toiletries, each bed had multiple (fluffy) pillows, everything was clean, the coffee and tea were stocked - it was amazing. 12/10 could not do more to recommend, except that I always want to come back here and not have this house booked every day of the year. Robby was also extremely helpful and allowed us to check out late when we won our game on Sunday morning. He was quick to respond and very flexible, which made the tournament stress free for us."

Group trip","We spent five nights at Robby's beautiful house while visiting our son for Christmas. The house offered plenty of space with lots of different rooms for everyone to spread out. The house is very tastefully decorated and well stocked with linens, dishes, glassware, platters, etc. Everything in the house worked well and was in really good condition. The house has a huge dining room table that was great for our holiday dinners. There were also lots of great books about the local area.
Robby was very responsive before and during our stay. He sent a ton of local recommendations which were very appreciated. We did not go exploring too much but we did enjoy a visit to the zoo, a private 2 hour ""learn to curl"" session at the Utica Curling Club and a nice dinner at Nola's in the town of Clinton. If you have a larger group visiting Utica I would highly recommend renting Robby's house."

Stayed with kids","Wow…. If there was a model for what AirBNB hosts should be, Robby is the poster child. Accommodating doesn’t begin to explain the lengths that Robby went to to make our stay as comfortable as possible and was extremely communicative, friendly and prompt in responding to requests and questions.
This house is a great place for entertaining larger groups, people with babies or children of any age. We enjoyed the huge dining room table as well as the thoughtfully designed kitchen and multiple living areas.
The home is a small piece of Utica history and Robby is dedicated to preserving and promoting that story. You’ll note the art on the walls featuring local artists, decorations that pay homage to Utica history, the various accoutrements throughout the home supporting local manufacturers and makers, and (my favorite) the fresh Utica Club and Saranac beers in the fridge upon arrival!! As a former son of Utica that has moved away, it’s refreshing and inspiring to see the pride Robby has shown my native home.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. We will see you again soon!"

Stayed with kids","I booked because the ad said ""Entire Home"" and the price was decent, but when I arrive it was clear that this is an apartment on the first floor of a two family property. I was a disappointed because I'm a light sleeper and would have preferred a 2nd floor apartment. I heard people walking around on the first evening and second day, and on the first morning, their dog's barking woke me up. I'm a light sleeper so that was not good. It would have been great to have some blackout curtains in the bedrooms and a key to the back door, or to have the main entrance as the back door since parking is in the rear. Other than the aforementioned, the apartment was clean and had literally everything I needed for my stay, and that was awesome. The location was superb, as it is right across the street from the park. I grew up in Utica so that was nostalgic, great for walking and a perfect place for my toddler to play. Overall this was a good stay and I would possibly stay there again."

The house itself was located just across the street from the Park which was great to have for walking our dogs. The house was very clean and neat and Medina was a delight to work with. Would stay again, in hopes that the tenant had a night shift instead of a day shift so it would be quieter to sleep."

It was clean and well-appointed. I am from the area, and my family is walking distance away. Medina had great communication and was very friendly. it was easy to find, park, and get in the apartment. We had no problems during the stay. I was sick during my visit, so I got to spend more time inside the apartment than I planned. Very cozy, electric tea kettle for hot tea, and a large front window to people watch the park across the street.
My only note is that this is an apartment and someone does live upstairs. I did not realize that. If you or someone in your group is a light sleeper, please note that. The upstairs occupant was quiet, but you can hear one another.
The kitchen has everything you need to cook a great meal. if you are looking to go out, there is a great restaurant called the Willows within walking distance. Everything they make is delicious and the service is wonderful!"

Location was great, the Loft was beautiful, very big with lots of room to spread out. The amenities were perfect. Antonia was so easy to work with, always available and quick to respond. Never had a problem with our six day stay in Utica. Got to know the entire crew from Nina's Pizza next door. The food was great, so convenient, and the staff was awesome. Thank you Jonny, Nate and Matty for making our stay so enjoyable, while we added on a few pounds eating all that Nina's had to offer. Utica Coffee Roasting Company also next door, another great place we enjoyed. Lastly a shout out to Chesterfield's Tavolo, absolutely great Italian restaurant and bar.
If/when we go back to Utica we will definitely be booking the Loft again with Antonia. Thanks again for providing such a great stay.

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely beautiful apartment with very comfortable furniture and even more comfortable beds. Full and conveniently arranged kitchen. Amazing views of the downtown Utica area. Building was secure as can be, and filled with very friendly tenants. And there are no words to adequately describe how welcoming, thoughtful, considerate, and obliging Laura was. Truly a remarkable host & property. We came to town for the birth of our first grandchild, and Laura made this event even more amazing by providing amazing accommodations and making us feel more welcome than we have ever felt at any hotel. Upon hearing our reason for visiting the area, she even left a bottle of Prosecco chilling in the refrigerator with a card congratulating us on becoming grandparents. My wife & I are eternally grateful, and highly recommend staying at any of her properties. This was our first Airbnb experience, and certainly the gold standard for us for future Airbnb stays."

It is a large unit and beautifully decorated. Great views from the 5th floor and location is great. Laura was an awesome host. She gave great details in how to get in and where to park. Great suggestions on places to eat and have a beer. We will stay in the future. This place is worth it.

Stayed a few nights","Wow!! Let's start with that. We have rented many AirBNBs and this by far was the BEST! We went to Utica, NY to watch my son play hockey at the Nexus Center. And when we arrived Laura was there to greet us. Very secure building and a 5 min walk from the Center. The Penthouse is as pictured on her site, big with beautiful decor. Laura walked us around, showed us everything there was to offer and then some. We stayed for week and I was able to work in a quiet atmosphere. We also used the beautiful, clean gym on the first floor. She didn't stop there. On the first night she sent a list of restaurants to try and we went to all of them! On the second night we were treated to local treats for desert. And if we did not want to go out, she had everything you needed so you could cook. We loved it so much, my wife and I took a picture in the living room before we left. I can say we have never done that before. If you are going to Utica you have to rent here. Thank You Laura!"

Group trip","We were in the area with my family and parents for my son's graduation from college. This Airbnb is so conveniently located to both SUNY Poly as well as Utica College and the downtown area. We needed a place not only to stay but hang out with family and this place delivered.
The living space is very comfortable and was perfect for hanging. The TV is da bomb and the dining table was a perfect spot for cards and games. The kitchen was well stocked and even had an amazing variety of spices and staples. There are some really fun features like the light on the faucet in the downstairs bathroom, the dining room lights, and the fireplaces in living room area and in an upstairs bedroom. The key feature that will have me back are the comfortable beds. If you've got the princess back that I do, you'll appreciate that every bed (mattress and bedding) felt heavenly. Overall, it was just really well done."

Directions for getting in were very helpful. The studio was exactly as described and pictured, and was everything was immaculate. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The kitchen was well supplied, save maybe for a teapot. There were great dining choices within the immediate area and others just a short walk away. The wifi worked perfectly and we were easily able to get the television set up for our streaming service. The pricing was quite reasonable. We enjoyed our stay.

The parking access is a nice bonus because there’s never any trouble finding a spot in the lot and I’m able to see my car from the studio. The tenants of the building are very nice anytime we crossed paths. I have one minor complaint and it’s that the studio can get quite warm, but cracking the window(s) open creates an instant breeze. Cheers!"

It was convenient to my work in downtown Utica and to the thruway for when I had to make a couple of runs into Syracuse. This was better than a hotel and more affordable. This is where I’ll stay on future work trips for sure. Honestly, even if the majority of my work is in Syracuse next trip, I’ll probably still stay here. It was that good that I would rather stay there and have a bit of a commute than in a hotel suite in Syracuse."

Stayed a few nights","I had never been to Utica before so all this was a first time experience. The location was an easy access driving in and it was pretty well located. It was awesome to have access to the building's parking and overall neighbors were friendly and quiet. Although the Airbnb is located near Utica's Amtrak station, train traffic wasn't too crazy. The brewery in the lower level of the building was a great place to chat with people and had some killer wings. The living space was great for me spending a long weekend for a wedding in Central New York. I think a couple would definitely have a comfortable time was well. Some amenities that are sometimes expected were not included, and they were listed as such. It didn't really impact the overall experience. I'd stay in this listing again if my travels take me back to Utica."

Shower was great; the bed really comfortable. Bath towns plenty and soft. Enjoyed the high ceilings and large ceiling fan. Nice to have the private parking area outside. The kitchen was clean; plenty of cooking pots and utensils. I’d suggest megan add a few full sized plates and bowls, if one wanted to cook meals or make salads during their stay. Found some soap under the bathroom cabinet. But had to purchase my own toilet paper, dishwashing liquid and garbage bags."

Stayed a few nights","Friendly hosts and a convenient location in a renovated historic building... this was a great place to base our short stay in Utica.
The bed was full size, so a bit snug for two adults, especially if one is very tall. But the room had other nice touches, like free Netflix already set up on the smart tv, which pivots conveniently on its mount directly in front of the bed. There were plenty of extra towels in the large closet, for anyone staying longer. Kitchen was equipped with utensils and cookware and had modern appliances.
Parking was fantastic and check-in was so quick and easy. Our trip was short so we didn’t use all the amenities, such as the gym, but it’s nice that they offer them.
Building is pet-friendly and even has a dog wash area off the main lobby. They are working on building out an on-site brewery/restaurant, but there are really good local options very nearby as well - don’t miss the local bakery down the street.
It was really nice to stay in a place with local character as opposed to a holiday inn or similar hotel, and at a great value."

The owner was more than willing to let us check-in early. He even gave a little tour of the building and the apartment. Our only complaint was how hot the apartment was. Since the apartment is on the second floor, all the heat from the building rose and with our a/c was set to 65, the temperature was still at 72. We like the cold. All together, it was a great apartment. We'd stay there again, even with the heat. Highly recommend."

I had to put the code in 3 times or more for the door to actually unlock. The heat was also an issue for me. The apartment never seemed to get warm enough for me. Nothing a small heater couldn't fix. The owner also came to welcolme me by knocking on the door. I did not like this because he did not reach out via the app and I normally travel alone but my husband came to check on me.

The first day they cleared the walkway to our car. The second day had heavy snow and they shoveled the driveway in the morning so we could exit easier.
The Airbnb was extremely clean and it’s a quiet area. The shower and toilet area are small.
The general area seemed to us to be in a bit of a rough area. The driveway had multiple cameras where you park your car, so that made us feel better. The parking area is deep between two houses, so your car is out of sight. There were no incidents or problems during our five day stay."

Stayed a few nights","This little Air B&B was exactly what I was looking for. Small, very clean, and a lot of character. For the price I saved a LOT of money VS staying at a motel. I was able to make meals for my trip and save even more. Angel and family was great to communicate with. If you are in the Utica NY area, I would strongly suggest!"

Stayed a few nights","When you arrive the area does not look great, homes weren’t well maintained in the area, it’s a very dead town . Luckily I only came to Utica to visit family, but I would never voluntarily choose to vacation there. The shower was extremely small but had great water pressure but be prepared to not be able to move around in the shower. You’re honestly getting what you paid for in the apartment and if you’re only staying for a few nights it’s much more cost effective than a hotel."

Stayed a few nights",I stayed here for work. My work had me walking through the woods in the hot and humid weather. The host was very accommodating allowing me to check out late so I could take a shower before heading home. Will definitely stay here again if my work takes me back to Utica.

Stayed about a week",Fresh apartment and very central. Everything needed in the kitchen was there. The only downside was that it was responsive from the apartment above and that there were no real windows to look out of the apartment without windows with frosted glass only. But great location in the city and included parking.

Stayed a few nights","Excellent value in downtown Utica. Area is a little rough but we knew that beforehand. (Hopefully, the hospital spurs redevelopment in the downtown.) The apartment was quite nice - updated and clean. Check in was clear, easy and convenient. I would recommend this airbnb in Utica."

Stayed about a week","The host was amazing from start to finish. Communication was excellent, any concerns that came up was quickly addressed and fixed. The place was spotless and is equipped with everything you will need to cook including pots, pans cutlery, baking sheets etc. The pictures do not do it justice. it much nicer in person. it looks small in photos but is much bigger then it looks. Parking pass is included if you need it. The exercise room open 24/7 and is a very quiet building. you do hear little feet from ceiling since it is a condo so if this is a problem for you i would not stay here. this did not bother us. It is right downtown. there is pizza , small restaurants and pub just few steps from location. if you want a grocery store you will have to drive or take local transit. We walk everywhere so was not an issue for us. Nothing bad to say about this place. We will be book anytime i am in Utica."
