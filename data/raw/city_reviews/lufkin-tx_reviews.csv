Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I had a beautiful time at this studio! It was peaceful, clean, big enough for the 2 of us, and had everything we needed! When we reached out to our hosts they were quick to respond and fulfilled our needs! The studio is near the town so getting food and doing things were a short drive! Overall this place was perfect for what we needed! We definitely recommend to anyone who wants a peaceful place to stay! God bless!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a very great stay! It’s far enough away from the main highways, but also close enough to the city. Best of both worlds if you are looking for things to do, but also having some privacy. Andrew and Mary-Beth were super responsive and quick to communicate. They gave great instructions and suggestions. The space was well kept and clean when we arrived, and they were there cleaning as soon as we left. Overall great stay!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for a month and it was quite lovely! Plenty of privacy and quiet if that’s what you’re looking for, it’s maybe 10 minutes driving into town or so.
It can be a little tricky to find the correct turn of the farm to market road when it’s dark, but there’s a little sign with lights indicated where to turn for the Airbnb, quite helpful! Also I was sort of unsure how it would go having the bed/common space all in the same room essentially, but the divider really does help make it feel like 2 separate spaces, so it worked well.
The hosts responded pretty quick usually and helped me out with the couple questions I had, it was a solid place to stay for a few weeks!"

The space is well organized and designed with tremendous natural light. The area felt private as well. Light sleepers may notice the road noise but that didn't bother me a bit.

The house was well equipped with everything that you could possibly need and then some. All of my packages where delivered very timely. Great communication from the hosts. Easy check-in and easy to find just take an immediate right once you turn into the driveway. All and all a great place to stay and I would highly recommend that you give it a try when you are in the area.

This location is pretty close to the road (behind the tree line), so what little traffic does come through does cut some of the peace of this very serene area of Texas. All in all, this place was absolutely worth it's cost and the hosts were very considerate and kind in any correspondence to us."

The minimalistic design, the natural light, the privacy, the fire-pit, the tv, the shower, the work/writing table with a view, the pond w kayak. Andrew and Mary-Beth were super responsive to some minor internet issues that came up (they actually upgraded their system to ensure I had reliable internet for my work) and they went above and beyond to make sure my stay was enjoyable- they brought over a fire-pit, stocked me up on firewood, and even upgraded the TV while I was there. They do good business and were very kind to me. If I come back through the area I would definitely stay again!"

- Providing an electric generator for an hour a day
- Providing me with a supply of bottled water
- Providing me with a thermal sleeping bag
- Upgrading me to another of his listings for free
- Offering to refund the days I was without power
Andrew is a great guy and this is a great place to stay. It's a peaceful forested area not too far from the city."

Stayed over a week","I recently moved to the area and decided to do a year of AirBnB's. This Lufkin Tiny Home was my second place. It was so lovely. I have had a fascination with Tiny Homes for awhile and Andrew and Mary-Beth's place was a great first experience! They have set the place up in such a cute, retro, minimalistic way. I loved the simplicity. The design allowed for the Tiny Home to feel quite spacious- beautiful open shower, tall ceilings, shelves instead of cabinets, and lots of windows. I could absolutely live here full time. And it would be the perfect getaway for anyone who needs to restore. My favorite touch was the work desk that was set up at the window. I am a writer so I considered it ""my (temporary) writing table"". The view of the trees with the visiting birds was just the inspiration I needed. I was blessed to be in this Tiny Home when the 2021 East Texas snow storm hit. What an unusual treat. The views of the snow falling from this Tiny Home were something I will never forget. I highly recommend this place for your own memory making!"

Stayed a few nights",Charming space just off the path but close enough to everything in town. We traveled in for a wedding and absolutely loved our stay. The furniture pieces are cute and have an antique vintage feel that really adds to the space. The hosts responded very quickly to any questions we had and were very warm. We will 100% come back again!

It is secluded down a little gravel road in the woods right off a highway and easy to find. If you are a night nurse bring a mask for your eyes cause the natural light brilliantly peeks through the windows! Great last stay in Lufkin for me.

The hosts were friendly and communicative about anything that affected my stay; they even delivered bottled water when the city water was shutoff due to pipe maintenance miles from the studio.
Just be sure to remember the route to the studio otherwise you can miss your turn."

Very quiet and peaceful too. We cook. When travel and plenty kitchen items. Even fresh breakfast items were there from the host. Nice big shower. Quality natural soaps and toilet paper. Comfortable bed and linens. We love having Netflix- it works! WiFi did too. Covered porch with chairs to enjoy outdoors - but the many windows make you feel outside. Perfect set up. Could move divider if wanted to- but works great with open curtains giving privacy to bed and bath area. Place to hang clothes, hair dryer, bathroom items if needed. Two great space heaters. The host responded immediately to any questions. Very close to town but feels country. Place to relax or just if need a place to stay."

A couple of things to be aware of: we found the bed too firm for our taste but we did sleep well. Also the studio is about 50 feet from the FM road which makes road noise noticable but not too disturbing. Communication with the hosts was quick and easy. We had an enjoyable time and would book this place again.

I did think the place would be more isolated based on the photos, but it is near a road so you can hear cars passing at night! However, it was not an issue for me.

Make sure to read up on the ""directions"" to get there. Once you've turned off the main road, the driveway to the studio is a quick right turn (approx 10 Yards). It was marked but I missed it the first time.

Highly recommend the tiny house for any occasion it's close to many things but secluded enough for the perfect getaway. Overall very pleased with our stay!

The location is basically 5 to 10 minutes away from wherever you might want to go in Lufkin. Access and parking is so easy and you don’t have to back out into traffic, although the traffic isn’t bad, which we really appreciated with a conversion van. We would definitely stay there again."

Jerry was very responsive to one minor issue with a door code and was very helpful assisting me with a delivery. I felt comfortable contacting him with any need. I would recommend to anyone needing a place to be in Lufkin."

Even had a vehicle situation and Jerry came to help. Most genuine person ever and I was grateful (and still am). I was here with just my dog and totally felt safe as well. I would definitely rent from Jerry and Patsy and stay here again!!

Our daughters enjoyed playing the piano & we had a fun time guessing the songs. I especially enjoyed sitting in the courtyard in the morning before everyone woke up with a cup of coffee listening to all the different birds singing away, even saw a woodpecker. 😆 It was really peaceful & much needed. Our furbabies really enjoyed the backyard too!! A lot for them to take in. ☺️ The house has some really neat history that we enjoyed reading about in a binder they put together. That was a really nice touch for the guests. I wish we could’ve stayed longer & had time to go for a walk around the neighborhood. It has so many beautiful trees & older homes with so much character. Kevin & Becky are wonderful hosts that really took care of our needs. We look forward to visiting again. 🥰"

Stayed with a pet","When I drove the fam down the street my wife said 'wow that house is gorgeous'. I pulled up in the spacious pass thru drive way and told her it's where we are staying for the next 3 nights. Well done me I suppose.
House is a spacious, historic midcentury with to die floor entry and back doors with brick main flooring and 3 massive outdoor spaces. It's close enough to walk to downtown ~ 1 mile but I'd prefer to drive as long as parking downtown is free which is a bonus in Lufkin's charming First Street area.
Our host was responsive and courteous, provided concise instructions and offered local advice which led us to a great downtown coffee shop and a few more quaint stores on First Street. We dropped a bit of coin at Becker Art Studio. These are great folks that deserve our patronage.
The house was 30 minutes to hiking in Davy Crockett National Forest and only 10 minutes more to Mission Tejas state park which I highly recommend.
I can't recommend this place enough. Enjoy."

The furniture is very comfy. The master bed is very cozy. The kitchen has everything for cooking or serving. There are two refrigerators which is nice.

The regular AC was nice and cool and we could regulate it very easy with a smart thermostat. The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, dishes and keurig coffee maker. There are two refrigerators which is very helpful if you are entertaining or staying a week. The king size bed was very comfy. The bathroom was clean with a great selection of towels. The living room was cozy and had pretty decor. There is a washer and dryer and dishwasher that we loved. If we could give 10 stars we would. We are looking forward to returning in the future!"

Stayed with a pet",Kevin and Becky were so kind and helpful during my stay. They checked in on me often and allowed me to extend my stay several times. The house was beautiful and perfect for myself and 2 dogs to stay in while I was waiting for my new rental to be available to move in. I would highly recommend staying there if you ever need a place to stay in Lufkin! I can't speak highly enough of them as hosts and am so grateful I was able to stay there.

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay here. The property has a small patch of woods to wander through, as well as a small pond. The cabin was very cute and mostly clean, though it could use a good deep clean to remove built up dust, stains, etc. It looked like some previous renters had spilled a drink down the wall behind the table by the bed and it was covered in dust, as well as cobwebs in the corners, on the ceiling and on the top of the rafters/half bathroom wall. Also, the ac spit a bunch of black stuff all over the bed when I turned it on, so I suppose it had been a while since it was used. As I am a single woman and was staying alone, I moved the couch in front of the door at night as it only had the one keyed deadbolt. The bed is VERY tall for a shortie (I'm 5'2"") and I almost couldn't get in it, so a step stool for short people would be nice. LOL. All in all, I enjoyed my stay here and would stay again! Terri was very nice and accommodating!"

Stayed a few nights",First I would like to say that Terri was an amazing host! Very proactive in reaching out and communicating. The place was super clean and cute! We informed her we would be arriving late and she left the light on and started cooling the place with the A/C!! Super sweet! The only thing (keep in mind we are BIG CITY people) dark roads are scary to us and the long drive down the driveway was scary 😂 but in the morning the view and peacefulness is amazing 💓 also if you hate bugs this may not be the place for you but as a bug freak I got to see the coolest bugs hanging around the porch lights including a huge spider eating her prey. 10/10 will book again when we are back in East Texas 🫶🏼 Thank you so much Terri!!!!

Stayed a few nights","Terri's cabins are 1 mile from the loop in Lufkin but feel like they are way out in the country. Her cabins are close to lots of great restaurants, downtown shopping, and close to local hospitals. The location is very convenient.
Terri's cabins have a walking trail, a small personal pond for fishing, and lots of wildlife and nature. The Farmhouse Cottage has a comfortable seating area on the front porch where you can sip your coffee in the mornings or sit and visit in the evenings overlooking the pond and nature. Inside the cabin is a complete set up to accommodate an individual or a couple. A comfortable full-size bed, a reclining loveseat, desk/table with chair, tv with lots of streaming options, a kitchenette and a full bath with lots of toiletries and linens.
My son and I came to town to visit family. We rented both cabins allowing each of us our own space. We were both very comfortable and enjoyed our visit. Terri even came down to say hello. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Great stay on a beautiful property. I loved just sitting on the porch and taking in the sounds of nature. WiFi worked well enough that I was able to stream movies from my laptop on the porch as well!
Terri was a great host, offering to have me stay in her guest room when some bad storms were passing through. The little house took the storms like a champ though and I never felt unsafe!
A couple things to note that you can’t tell from the pictures: this cabin sits right next to the other cabin on the property, but the porches do not face each other so it still feels private. The view from this porch includes the back of the other cabin and the driveway, so it isn’t the most scenic but it’s still nice. Also, the shower is quite small: think RV shower. I am an average sized female and it felt cramped for me, so something to keep in mind if you are a larger person."

Stayed a few nights","If either one of Terri’s cabins are available for dates you need to stay in/near Lufkin, I strongly recommend booking it immediately. It would be difficult to find a more hospitable host, with such a cozy cabin, on as beautiful of property as hers.
Terri was going above & beyond before I arrived- she informed me of a vacancy in her 2nd cabin for the extra day I needed and graciously allowed me to switch my reservation(I didn’t have to stay at a hotel the 1st night in town this way.) She also communicated the option to check-in early, yet had a safe/easy check-in option for arriving after dark.
The house was stocked with everything one would need for a short stay plus added amenities like snacks, wine, and my favorite: fresh eggs from Terri’s hens.
My girlfriend not only appreciated the cute decor that made the cabin warm & cozy, but she had no issue getting ready for a wedding in the tiny, but strategically-designed, bathroom space
I received permission to bring my dog and he loved running the property and swimming in the pond with Terri’s dog- the covered front porch was a favorite spot for dogs & humans alike to enjoy the peaceful ETX outdoors.
In case you needed more convincing that this is the space for a solo traveler or a cuddly couple, I spent my last morning packing my things, planning another reason to have a weekend getaway at one of Terri’s cabins."

Stayed a few nights","Hidden Treasure! We found this great place while searching for a new little get away spot. The price was amazing and we couldn’t wait to get there. Upon arrival we found a beautiful cottage on a amazing property surrounded with wild natural beauty. The cottage was spotless and the snacks and fresh eggs were so thoughtful! We were immediately welcomed by Terri and she is an absolute sweetheart! We spent the weekend fishing on the pond, hiking through Davy Crockett National Forest and having a blast! The local H‑E‑B had a good selection of steaks and we grilled on the brand new grill outside. We had a nice fire and slept in a very cozy bed, the pillows smelled amazing! We had such a great time and hoping to go back soon! Thank you Terri for sharing your home and your beautiful property!"

It was the cutest little cottage with such stylish coziness like Joanna Gaines herself had decorated it! It was sparkling clean and stocked with such thoughtful little touches! The property was beautiful, peaceful, serene, and felt like paradise! I had one of the most relaxing and fun weekends! Terri and her crew are all amazing people! We had such a fun night hanging out around the big bonfire laughing talking listening to music and dancing! Terri was an absolute angel and such a joy to hang out with! I am making this my permanent little cozy cottage getaway from now until eternity! I didn’t want to leave! Seriously Terri if you ever consider wanting a full time tenant hit me up! 😜🥰 Loved every second of my stay!!!!!!! If I could give her a million stars I would!!!! 5 stars times infinity! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

There are new upgraded appliances (including washer and dryer), comfortable beds, spacious bedrooms, and a large bathroom with double sinks. There is a huge backyard. The neighborhood is very quiet and we felt safe. Azucena is very responsive and responds right away with answers to questions. My kids loved having 3 TVs so they did not have to share. She has thought of everything. If you forget something at home, she has you covered! She is also very thoughtful. We were visiting for a funeral and she had a beautiful token of her condolences waiting for us when we arrived. I will definitely recommend this beautiful home to family and friends and we will definitely be staying here again. Book with her. You will not be disappointed!"

My wife really appreciated the light switches being labeled…it’s the little things. The home smelled new and refreshing. The home is close to Morris Frank Park, Chic Fil-A, La Unica, Brookshire Bros and 5ish minute drive to downtown Lufkin. So it’s very convenient.
Check-in was very easy, owners were responsive, and the home has all the necessities you would need if you were doing an extended stay.
As someone who constantly visits Lufkin, it’s very nice to see a new listing on Airbnb. Already booked this place for the next visit."

The house was easy to find with plenty of parking space. We had a large group of ladies and they were all very impressed with the house. It is even nicer in person than the pictures show! Plenty of places to sleep without the rooms feeling cramped, lots of room to spread out or gather together to fellowship in the large living room. Wi-fi worked great! The place just had a really welcoming feel to it and made it easy for every person to settle in and relax. Check in and out was very easy. House rules were clear. Several commented how much they liked staying in the house together than in separate hotel rooms. The house is conveniently located close to local restaurants, grocery stores and general shopping. We were very impressed with this rental and definitely recommend it!"

It was lovely sitting on the back porch with a big lot of land, bird feeders, and pond. We chatted with our friends and James came to say hello and check on us! Brenda knew we might play board games so she let us know where an extra card table was.
Lovely visit and would highly recommend! I'll be looking for this place again when we need to visit Lufkin!"

Verizon cell service doesn’t work well in the house but does work. They said AT&T gets the best service - it may be helpful to bring a service booster with you 😊

I thought we were going get to try the fire pit out this time but didn’t get a chance. Charles and Patricia are always looking out for us. Last time we were my grandson left his stuff horse Ms Patricia found it and saved it for him. He was so excited to get it back. Once again thank y’all so very much for a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","We would give them 10 stars if we could! My husband and I brought our two young children for a little weekend getaway and couldn’t have chosen a better location!
We met the owners right upon arriving and were welcomed with friendliness and generosity and helpful tips for our stay. They keep the fridge and freezer stocked with some extra goodies (drinks, snacks, desserts, etc - small fees for each thing, but well worth it!).
The house was clean and exactly as pictured. The property was beautiful! It was chilly so we didn’t get to do quite as much outside exploring/play time as we wanted, but still took a walk around the pond to see the ducks and collect pine cones :) our little ones were in heaven!
Charles and Patricia communicated proactively and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. We both agreed they were the kindest, most generous Airbnb hosts we’ve ever encountered. We would recommend this place highly and plan to visit again!"

Stayed with a pet","This home is out in the country and is very peaceful. It was accessed by a short 1/4 mile drive down a dirt road from a paved road. It was immaculately clean and Charles provides some beverages and snacks for a fee, in case you didn't bring those things with you. He adds extra touches like kleenex, dish soap and paper towels which were much appreciated. The towels were thick and fluffy and there were washcloths too. Even though he and his wife live on the property, there is a building in between that provides privacy and the windows overlook the fields on the other side of the home. My husband greatly enjoyed the catch and release fish pond. This is a working farm so he drove by a few times on his tractor, but it wasn't invasive at all. The house is very well appointed and we enjoyed our time there!"

Stayed a few nights","I’m very happy we selected this Airbnb location. Mr. Charles was very friendly and responsive. He greeted us upon arrival and gave us a tour of his lovely rental. The location is super rural and secluded. The space is calm, quiet, cozy and most important—CLEAN. Every accommodation was covered—we loved the soft bamboo sheets and the shower was relaxing with great water pressure. It was a treat to see deer freely roaming the property.
I struggled not to drink the alcohol available for purchase!! I resisted the temptation of using the Bartesian maker, but it’s a cool machine for those who consume alcohol.
I would love to return if I ever travel to Lufkin again. This is a five star retreat I’m my opinion."

Stayed with a pet","Our family felt so at home at Cashrock Farm. We thought travelling for a funeral would be somber but watching Stranger Things on Netflix with our kiddos & walking in the mornings to the pond with our pup made it a wonderful vacation.
We brought our 19 pound terrier rescue & he loved morning walks to the pond. We had to leave our dog at the property for a funeral and reception. We travelled with our dogs kennel, this made things so much easier for us because he likes to sleep there and we made sure to be respectful of the hosts space while we were away for a few hours.
Some might describe the exaughst fan to help reduce condensation as noisy. We live in a city so it didn't bother us at all. And the temperature in this house while it was well over 100 degrees in the summer outside was so cool, a little rattle noise is well worth the comfort.
Our southern realtives all overwhelmed our aunt with food & we saved the day by storing food in the generous fridge at the property and we all had a big leftover dinner in the evening.
things we loved:
the bedding was so comfy & space clean.
location was easy to find & visit Southern Lufkin from our home base
the cleaning supplies available allowed us to keep everything tidy as we were there with teens for many days.
the hard cider was my wife's fav part of stay.
the washer and dryer was such a luxury & appreciated
small things we have experienced at other AirBnBs that might improve future stays:
A small box fan for the bunk bed room as that room gets stuffy with two teenagers.
list of local things like Rays drive in & the natural history museum that folks with kids might enjoy (we loved it)
More than one place to hang towels mb a hook behind door. The wet towel situation was tricky with 4 people and only one towel rack
We have stayed with a lot of hosts and this tops our list as a family favorite. 10/10 would stay again."

The white rocking chairs on the front porch are perfect for watching the deer in the early mornings and evenings. The home was impeccably clean and fully stocked with everything you may need. The mattress is very firm and the linens are luxurious. By far one of my best Airbnb experiences! Front door parking and high speed Internet."

The AC struggled to keep the house under 80° until well into the night. I think it ran the entire length of our stay, even when we turned it up, as the directions say, when we left the house for the day.
Also, if you have a lower vehicle you might want to park in the street. Our SUV struggled to get down the driveway.
All in all, we would stay here again, just maybe not in the summer."

Rebekah’s communication was precise, the home was clean and well stocked, and the location is convenient to the museum, downtown shops, and the zoo."

Stayed a few nights","One of the best Air BnB we have ever stayed in. The home exceeded our expectations. Beautiful home. The pictures did not do this place justice. All the special touches provided made us feel so at home. Beds were very comfortable, plush linens, cozy family room, a quaint little coffee nook for morning coffee, and lots of room for a family. Perfect walking distance to downtown, coffee shops, brewery, wine bar and shops. We LOVED this place! ❤️"

Stayed with kids","My wife and I have stayed here twice while visiting family. The house has charm, history, and everything you could ask for in a home away from home. Seriously, the owners have curated a place that could give you a glimpse into the history of Lufkin from pictures throughout the house to the books in the living area. I can’t recommend this place enough. It’s close to downtown Lufkin which makes for a nice evening walk and close to what is one of my favorite coffee shops in general in Standpipe. Sold! Can’t wait till our next stay at this home."

The history behind the home was so interesting to read out in the welcome binder and there were even original photos of the house which everyone in my family loved.

Stayed with kids","Pictures don’t even do this sweet gem justice!! My in-laws live in the Lufkin, Alto area & this was our 2nd attempt at staying at an AirbnB while visiting. The first was not a pleasant experience. Rebekah is truly a “super hostess”. She thought of everything! From the convenient keyless entry to the informative binder full of shopping, restaurant suggestions & easy to understand instructions for the home & the cutest coffee nook, this was such a memorable experience for our family. Super clean & beds were cozy! On top of that we were arriving early & Rebekah allowed us to check in early & check out late (we just didn’t want our stay to end).
Will definitely be booking again for our next visit!"
