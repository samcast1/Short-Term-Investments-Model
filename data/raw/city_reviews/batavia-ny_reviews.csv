Stayed with kids","Megan's Place was absolutely perfect for my needs! Not only did the place totally live up to the pictures, it exceeded my expectations. Megan truly paid attention to every small detail that makes your stay comfortable. From something as small as the new sponge at the sink to the yummy smelling shampoo and conditioner, soft towels (a lot of them), the comfy beds to the way she communicated - I would 100% recommend Megan's Place to anyone.
We visited the U.S from Canada and selected Megan's place for the price, proximity and cleanliness. It's a bargain in comparison to the nearby hotels and blows the state of those hotels out of the water! From the moment we arrived it was easy to find, simple to unlock the door, everything we needed was in the rooms and it was just SO clean and homely.
Megan, thank you for making this stay completely painless and being so kind, thoughtful and responsive. When we end up visiting these relatives again, I know where I'm staying!"

Stayed with kids","The beds are comfy, the sheets are soft and the house is set up for everything you need. I however would not stay here again.
There is a green water above ground pool out back. With a toddler staying with us, the gate was very easy to unlatch and VERY UNSAFE.
The owner stopped by everyday to complain about how we parked. Don’t try to fit 3 or 4 vehicles here.
There is someone living in the basement. The listing just states no basement. We were not made aware of this and left early because of it.
There are a lot of spiders in the house.
The location is great but there are items that need work. I wouldn’t stay here again."

Bed was a little small for my husband and I but that's mostly due to us being used to a king. Bed was still comfortable. Overall I would recommend if needing a place in the area.

Perfect central location to anywhere in Genesee County or Buffalo. The apartment was stocked with water and cooking supplies and the design touches made it feel modern and comfortable. The fireplace and heated floors made the March weather a little more bearable, too! I was even able to get a late check out which was super helpful as I had to work remotely. Much appreciated. Highly recommend and will save this to my list for the next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Great, clean and cozy place to say when I came with my daughter to see Hamilton in Rochester and to explore the area for her 16th birthday! It was great having a location that was central to Rochester and Niagara Falls!
The apartment was very clean, warm (for these North Carolinians), and beautiful! Exactly as described. The kitchen was especially beautiful and well-supplied, although we never used it. The only thing I wish I’d been prepared for was the road noise; however, the White Noise app on my phone was an easy remedy. The bed was very comfortable!
As an aside, I thought I’d recommend The Coffee Press for excellent coffee and food/wine if you need breakfast or lunch out while in Batavia. And Roman’s on Main had delicious food and wine for dinner, with gluten-free options!"

We really enjoyed the space as it was prefect for two and quite quaint. Note that you are located off a main road to and from Batavia, so there is some road noise, but not enough to disrupt our sleep. While we did not use any appliances or watch any TV, those items are there and of good quality. It was a quick stay, but a very good one.
Thanks for everything, Bruce!"

I spent two weeks here while visiting family and it was my home away from home. So comfortable and it didn't hurt that it looked good as my Zoom meeting background. Bruce is an attentive host, providing basics in the apt that I wasn't expecting (coffee! drinks!) and a thoughtful surprise basket of treats. Never saw him, he was like a magic elf, so had my privacy--but if I needed something, it appeared shortly thereafter. Will definitely come back and have already recommend this place to friends and family."

We especially appreciated the herbal tea, bottled waters, comfy bed, Apple TV (so we could finish watching Ted Lasso) and quiet country setting. It's not far from Rt. 90 and is close to D &R Depot Restaurant, a favorite for some good home-cooking. We plan to make this a regular stop on our trips east."

Desa herself is a gem of a person! I had ever changing agendas and she was so accomidating, working hard to help me in any way that she could! She was very patient with me! Lol
Upon arrival she came by to greet me and we shared an amazing conversation!
Once she knew i was leaving, she even left a little gift in the patio chair, waiting for me to find!
I highly recommended this place if yoir looking for a quiet, peacful place to stay. The stars are amazing, the firepit is right there and the wildlife is ever present!

Jessica was extremely responsive. We had an oops with the breaker due to the air fryer and she told us exactly where to find the box. Simple flip of the switch and we were back up and running.
The home was extremely clean and very well updated for being an older building. We have friends in the area, which is what brought us to Batavia. Will definitely be staying here again when we return!"

Also she gives great recommendations for places to visit like I recommend trying Pub Coffee Hub its in walking distance and makes really good breakfast burritos (my favorite is the M.F.B.A with both sausage and bacon) and if yur a fan of Friends the show yu'll love their selection!! Again can't thank Jessica enough for making us feel at home we had a great time and hope to do it again soon 💙

This newly renovated apartment is better than other places we’ve stayed where the work was done to minimal standards - to the contrary the kitchen and bathroom were solidly built and well-done. Photos and description were completely accurate.
Our family of 4 was very comfortable here - beds were just right and our school-aged kids loved having their own twin beds in a separate room.
Overall, a wonderful new option - we’ll be back."

Yes, there is street noise, mostly early in the morning when people are going to work. Before 7a, it is not too bad...maybe a truck going through at 5:30a but not steady traffic. I would suggest using the white noise machine or getting ear plugs. Sometimes late in the evening, after 9a, there can be noise. er
Jessica is very responsive if you need something and very considerate to one's privacy."

Incredibly clean and I’m picky about this. Enjoyed being within walking distance to Dewitt Park for our morning exercise. I’ve stayed at more than a dozen listings and not many would I say I would revisit again if in the area, but I definitely would for this one."

The multiple candles (battery operated of course) are a nice touch and create a relaxed environment. The bathroom and shower were very well done and everything throughout was new, clean, and well maintained. There can be a bit of traffic noise but there's even a sound machine in the bedroom (we didn't need it but it's there if you wanted). Thank you, Jessica, it's clear that you've worked hard to create and maintain a great space for your guests. We would certainly stay here again."

Nice to sit on dock and watch the fish, couldn't swim off dock due to a lot of weeds. We went to swimming area on other side of lake. The only negative would be there wasn't a lot of room in the refrigerator due to food left there and the counters had to be cleaned a lot of food crumbs all over. Other than that it's a very nice place and great for a getta way."

We made the trip up to Western New York to visit nearby family for Thanksgiving and Ed's home offered all the amenities we needed and more. Ed provided some nonperishable food items that were available to us, a coffee machine, and just about any essentials you would need to make a comfortable stay. The home was very clean, which is a plus!! The pictures of this home do not do it justice, it is peaceful, a nice size for 2-3 people, cozy, beautiful home on the lake. I would stay at Ed's place again and again! The only other thing that should be noted is that there is no Wifi at Ed's home and only basic cable. This was no issue for us as we still did have cell service and utilized our hotspot. I would suggest bringing DVD's if you plan on having a movie night in. (DVD provided at Ed's). Everything else was amazing! We had a great stay at A Little Piece of Heaven!!"

It’s so warm and inviting we will definitely be going back. If we could stay half the year at the cabin and half home we would. Check out came too soon.

Even though the weather was cool and rainy I was able to enjoy the outside view while sipping a nice hot cup of hot chocolate, stretched out on a window seat overlooking the lake. The furnishings are ample and comfortable. Ed contacted me the day of my arrival with clear instructions. I highly recommend this ‘Little Piece of Heaven’."

Stayed a few nights","We spent 2 nights at Ed's cottage, to celebrate my husband's birthday and had a few things to do in the near by area (obstacle event & hockey game in BUF), Ed's cottage was a good location for a ""base"", as we live 2 hours in the opposite direction. The first night, we sat lake side with a glass of wine and a small fire, Ed left us enough fire wood to last an hour....it was very relaxing for the next day's busy schedule. The area had an unexpected heat wave the weekend we were there and although the cottage doesn't have a/c, we brought a fan (there's one in the cottage too) and survived, but didn't sleep good (we might be spoiled, as we have central a/c at home). I don't know the area well, and maybe we just caught the schedule just right, but there were freight trains at all hours through the night, that went through the area that can be heard, so if you're a light sleeper please keep this in mind. Otherwise, the cottage has everything you need, Ed is very easy to contact, check-in & check-out is super easy and sitting on the deck in the morning while we had our morning coffee was perfect. Per our future needs, we would consider Ed's cottage again."

Stayed one night","Ed's house was fantastic! The house was very clean and welcoming, the view of the lake behind the house was gorgeous and serene. We had a little trouble finding the house at first because we checked in at night but Ed answered the phone right away and talked us through how to find the right place. He sincerely wanted us to enjoy our stay and that was evident in our conversation over the phone and the tidiness of his home. We were just traveling down I-90 and needed a place to stop and after 1 night we wished we had more days to spend there. Thank you for a fantastic stay! I would recommend this home to couples needing a quiet getaway or families with young kids (there are plenty of beds) :)"

Ed is a fantastic host and he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and more for a great stay. It is not a new structure but it met my expectations for an older lake cottage. The house felt comfortable with the windows open and fan on though there is no air conditioning. We also enjoyed access to the beach swimming area too which had a diving board and slide. I would stay again.

It fit our needs of being close to family in the Batavia NY area.

We arrived to him greeting us warmly with whatever we might need. Our stay didn't disappoint - the serene frozen lake and beautiful view was a joy and ended up being the mini break we never expected.
Practically speaking, everything you might need is here! The bed is very comfortable, the linens are lovely, and the sofa faces out a wall of windows over the lake. We currently live in an apartment, and we so loved the peace and serenity of Ed's place; something we don't get at home."

The amenities are over and above what is expected including ice cream and ice cream treats in the freezers of both refrigerators. The air conditioning was fine for both floors for the weekend in July we spent. Linda and Philip were always available to answer any questions we had.

In front of the house there is a small fireplace with firewood and on the balcony there is a large gas grill. The beds are very comfortable.
The area is very quiet and you sleep very deeply here even with the windows open.
There is nothing lacking in the kitchen. The hosts are quite wonderful people. We had a nice longer conversation with them.
We wish Linda and phil always the best guests and still much joy with the farmhouse. Thank you!!!"

They have thought of everything that you need (plus things we didn't think of). The upstairs deck was a perfect place to sit and have coffee, taking in the scenery and watching the horses. The house is immaculately kept. It is a quiet area and a short drive to get to so many activities and sights. They had a great selection of brochures and guides for things to do in the area. I cannot say enough great things about this place. Highly recommend is an understatement. Thank you so so much to Linda for hosting our small group of Aerialists!

It’s about 1 hour 30 min away from Niagara Falls in Canada and 15 minutes away from Batavia NY where you can have a nice dinner and live music .
The only downside is that there are no food shopping markets close by, the closest is in Batavia NY, however I will definitely go back.

Everything was booked because of the PGA Tour & the Lilac Festival. Luckily this new listing came up & I booked it quickly. I almost cried when I walked into the house because it was even nicer than the photos looked - the house is open & bright! There was enough space for us to spread out plus space to gather as a family. On the main level is kitchen (just minus a stove/oven but includes microwave), a bedroom with a daybed style bed & trundle pull out, a 1/2 bath, laundry, open dining/living room/sitting area with electric fireplace. Upstairs is 2 bedrooms w/queen beds, full kitchen & full bath off the primary bedroom which also opens onto a deck with table & grill. Everything looked new & spotless. The kitchen was better stocked than my own including pots & pans, spices, dishes & utensils. The property was private & had a view of horses. 1.25 hour drive to Niagara Falls."

The kitchens are both well equipped, with most items you would require for cooking. As an animal lover, the only thing I did not like about this place is that I couldn't touch the horses, but, definitely understand :).

This was the nicest Airbnb we have ever stayed in, and we have stayed many places in both Batavia NY and San Diego CA. We will be back...next week!"

Stayed a few nights","Really enjoyed the stay in Batavia over the Christmas weekend. The place was clean, lots of lighting, and very comfortable. Had plenty of space to make a full meal and open some presents under a cute little tree he had so kindly set up. Made great use of the hot tub, even in the cold! It was a wonderful house and would book here again if we come up next year."

Stayed with kids","We travel often and rent many homes. Joey’s place was hands down the cleanest and most well appointed we ever stayed in. We had the pleasure of meeting him and his parents and they were super friendly and told us to call if we needed anything at all. The beds were very comfortable, hot tub and patio wonderful, we loved watching the deer outback in am and on. Thankyou again for sharing your home with us."

Stayed with kids","The house was nice and clean. Joey was friendly and great with communication. Big & little kids both enjoyed arcade machine. Downside there were four of us & living room only sat three. From the pictures, we assumed the setup allowed for a more private use of the pool. Though, in fairness, the online description does say shared pool/hot tub."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood. They went all out with amenities and making your stay comfortable. Access to hot tub and pool was a great bonus for the hot summer vacation. (This is a rare find in Batavia). We didn’t realize the grill, hot tub and pool were shared and others may be using it. This was awkward at times. There was no outdoor fire pit. Overall, the vacation was still great. We enjoyed seeing deer and Fox in the backyard. The arcade game was a blast for all ages. Joey was very responsive and friendly!!"
