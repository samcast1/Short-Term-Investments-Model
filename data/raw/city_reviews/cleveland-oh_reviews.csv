Stayed one night","I absolutely loved my stay here, and might be one of my favorite Airbnb's! The decorations are so great, and everything is thoughtfully placed. very very original artwork and decor, and everything is spotlessly clean. The bed is super comfortable, and the kitchen had all the amenities you needed! looking forward to staying again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Great space and a great host. Rare to find hosts that actively communicate as much to make sure everything is good. Only negative is the parking garage that’s nearest is not attached, it’s in bad shape, and expensive. The overnight rate for my days was 27/night. Obviously not the hosts fault and simply some of the issues with being downtown in any city.
At the end of the day, I’d stay here again given how convenient the location. Walking distance to ballpark, Cavs arena, many bars and restaurants. All said, great space with a great host!"

The view was beautiful! Golden hour really made the place stand out. Check in was a little bit of an issue, but Anthony was VERY responsive and took no time to communicate. I would highly recommend his space for anyone looking to enjoy Cleveland. It makes me excited to visit again now that I got the lay of the land a little. Thank you again for the experience!"

Stayed a few nights","So, if you're not from this area, then you might be surprised at how loud the location is. it is in an apartment complex right about the Flats of Cleveland. this area has a lot of bars and usually live bands playing. the apartment does not shy away from the music. it is loud, so if you're looking for quiet weekend you will not get that here. however, the location was perfect for us. my husband and I used it for our wedding weekend. some of the bridesmaid and I stayed there Friday night night (there was 4 of us) and then we got ready there the morning of. there was a total of 15 of us in there for hair and make up (2 make up 2 hair stations, 2 photographers) and it still felt very roomy in there. it was perfect for us."

Great restaurants and views and lots of good people watching out of the huge windows. Place was immaculate. Only minor thing that could use improvement was low water pressure but I know that's not really in host's control. Will definitely be back!

With it being located in The Flats, there is lots to do and see and many places to eat. Being above clubs, next to the railroad tracks and next to a lifting bridge, be sure to bring some earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Anthony was a very communicative host and had great details to make it easy to check in and out."

Apartment was somewhat bear bones, not super comfy for hanging in, but good to drop bag and go out.
The listing indicates that you can drop bags early in the day, which was a big draw for us flying in early. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case. The front desk staff was very sweet and understanding, tried to help out in any way they could. Really more of a problem with the listing itself."

Stayed a few nights","Anthony’s condo was outstanding. Very clean in a newer building with the front desk staffed 24/7. The parking garage had 24/7 security. The view from the apartment was exceptional. Outstanding communication from Anthony. WiFi is excellent.
The City of Cleveland has invested substantial money in the area known as “The Flats”. The city worked with developers to build restaurants, entertainment venues and housing. It is a combination of renovations of older buildings and building of new structures. There is a boardwalk along the river.
The location of Anthony’s condo is part of that development. The location was perfect. At least 10 restaurants within walking distance. Several of the restaurants had views of the river. Constantino’s Market is close and caters to apartment dwellers. Be sure to stop at ""The 27 Club"" coffee house. Ask about their story.
Highly recommend Anthony's place."

Stayed a few nights","Wished we could stay longer. Was in for a wedding so not at the place too much but it was sooo nice. Would def stay again. The only downsides (I’m not even sure they are downsides just something to note when looking) were that the elevators were trashed by the end of the night and the outside nightlife noise was super loud until 2am. I mean the location is incredible right in the mix of things so that’s understandable but bring earplugs if you’re trying to sleep before 2am.
The inside is the apartment is beautiful and the view amazing. There’s so much room and open floor plan. All the amenities you need. Clean and minimalist decor.
Would def stay again."

The condo is on the seventh floor so far from the street although you will hear some noise from the restaurants below into the evening. The train and boats also make noise so bring ear plugs if you're noise sensitive however the noise did not bother us in the least. The bed is super comfortable, we slept like a rock.
Thank you Anthony for a wonderful experience we will plan to return to your space the next time we are in the area."

Stayed with kids","On Anthony’s Space: Anthony’s space was fantastic! Anthony was a clear and prompt communicator. Love how easy it was once we got inside. Handwritten envelope appreciated! The middle closet area could use some attention. The furniture looks great in the picture but in person… The place is nice, but it feels empty/ bachelor-like. Great if you want a simple solitude or a business focused aesthetic. Less great if you want warmth, intimacy, and high energy for your trip.
On non-refundable policy: Disappointed the booking was still non-refundable after booking an incorrect number of nights. Wanted to book another night, but the following night needed was unavailable on the calendar which is understandable.
Still…$230 for 9 hours of use. Terrible deal with a listing at $98/night. After this experience, Highly unlikely to book properties with non-refundable option that doesn’t account for booking errors on tight schedules."

Stayed one night","The Host place is Stylish&Classy. Very spacious and Relaxing. Similar to being in a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ hotel. Only Better because for the $ you get WHOLE HOUSE and More. This is A Great Get Away. And the Large window night lights scenery is Spectacular Indeed!! Also large screen tv in both front and bedroom. Last but not least the bed and pillows felt Remarkably Comfortable. Its Very Much Worth the trip and Money. My people were Astonished with compliments and Luxury Indeed. Anthony and his place Is A+ Awesome. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Down!! Thank You Anthony. I Love Me Some Airbnb's.❤️

Stayed a few nights","Awesome place to stay for a weekend on the flats. Went for girlfriends birthday. Check in can be confusing (especially since it was my first time in the flats) but overall worth it. His check in instructions are clear, I just didn’t know the area at first.Place has a beautiful view and is located right above all the bar life in the flats. Tho being so close to the bars, it is very sound proof and peaceful. Would recommend for a special occasion going out with friends. Close to the bars and a scooter distance from downtown. No need to drive and no worries."

Lamp’s remote didn’t have battery cover which made me afraid of damages blame. Host could have been nicer and kinder in his messages.
Overall good stay. Nice view of the lake. A bit loud. Would stay again tho."

Stayed one night","Great place if you love nightlife! Very Easy Check in and private parking spot which was nice for how busy the area was. Everything you could want to do is within walking distance. A lot of fun restaurants and bars. Apartment was very clean and just as pictured. My only “complaint” is that Shampoo/Body wash are listed as available, but only Body wash was found. Not a huge deal by any means but unfortunate because I didn’t bring my backup stuff. A warning to some who may care- there is a night club near by that didn’t close until 2am. Very Loud but eventually I was able to fall asleep. I come from the country so not something I’m used to- but honestly was a great place. No major complaints or concerns at all. Anthony was super friendly and very quick to respond to my messages. Would recommend"

As some of the other reviews have mentioned the location was quite noisy come night time (Memorial Day Weekend). Due to its proximity to the club and Flats scene in Cleveland there was excessive noise late into the night. This is not Anthony's fault and he is a great host! It was just not what we were looking for for our weekend away."

The place is very clean, however not a lot of furniture or other items. True basic necessities. In the listing it shows an air mattress in the unit, however it was present upon arrival. Through messaging the quick host he responded saying it’s available upon request only. So keep that in mind when booking and prior to checking in. Otherwise great place, wonderful view and a great spot to be in with the nightlife just downstairs."

Stayed a few nights","Great place - awesome host ! We were on a trip from Illinois so that I could escort my parents to dad's Cleveland Clinic appointments for the week. My girlfriend and I stayed at Anthony's place - once I brought my parents up, they were sold on staying here or similar next time instead of the expensive hotel room.
My girlfriend and I love craft brews - easy walks to several of these and Good restaurants. Despite this, my girlfriend rarely left the place during the day while I was with my parents at the clinic. She was appreciating the spacious living area as well as the views of Cleveland Harbor and Lake Erie from the balcony of the bedroom.
It was an easy 15 min, no traffic drive to Cleveland Clinic each day.
Anthony went above and beyond to accommodate a special request and was very prompt with communications. Easy check-in. Would look forward to staying again."

Stayed a few nights","Exceptional! Evelyn’s place provides you with a quiet hideout within a cozy neighborhood with everything you could ever need to make a short or long stay comfortable. I enjoy cooking every time I stay in an airbnb and she had all the utensils (plus a collection of snacks and great teas/ coffee, and spices). I think my 3 favorite experiences in the airbnb were ogling the plants, enjoying breakfast on the outdoor patio, and having some of the most restful naps/ nights of rest on the couch and bed. She went above and beyond to make sure that all the tiny touches were added so that I’d feel right at home. I would definitely recommend this place and gladly stay again."

Stayed with a pet","We have been to the Cleveland area 3 times now and have stayed at a new place each time. The hosts have always been great and the places were okay, but it was never “good enough” for us to be returning guest. That changes with Evelyn’s place! We will be returning to the area at least once a year for years to come and we are already hoping Evelyn’s place will be available each and every time.
We communicated ahead a time confirming it would be okay to bring our two paralyzed cats. We know most host expect dogs as companions but Evelyn didn’t skip a beat in allowing us to stay. Not only that, she went out and got a brand new cat toy for our cats and had it waiting on us! That was so unexpected and kind.
The place was easy to find, easy parking, easy entry, and super great of an area to get in and out of.
Communication was always quick and super kind. Couldn’t recommend this place more for your future stay. Unless it’s when we want to be there, then please don’t book (lol)!"

I’ve stayed at countless airbnbs and have noticed over the years that the warmth and hospitality has disappeared as of late. Evelyn reminded me of the earlier years of airbnb where you truly felt you were at home. Highly recommend this listing and I hope to stay again in the future."

Stayed one night","Evelyn’s spot offered a feeling of home while on the road. It truly felt like we were staying at a friend’s house. The house was immaculate: both in details of design & cleanliness. They also considered many small details: cough drops, q-tips, an essential oil diffuser. The plants give the space a welcoming warmth. The bed is firm, but I like that. Truth be told I fell asleep on the couch, unintentionally, after an 18 hour day that involved much driving and other semi-stressful logistics. I was out like a light for the night, which only goes to show that the couch is also very comfortable. Access was easy, communication was clear… would absolutely stay with them again."

Stayed a few nights","we came for a weekend trip from Buffalo and Evelyn was very welcoming 😊 her home is BEAUTIFUL! we met friends for one of their birthdays and planned to do a lot of exploring but we were so cozy we ended up parked on the couch watching tv wrapped in all the cozy blankets! it was nice to have the option of coffee or tea in the morning (both delicious) and the option of a non dairy creamer in the fridge! we had some pretty crazy wind for our trip so we lost power several times and she had to send her husband to tie the gate back after the latch broke - still no problem! towels are fluffy, soaps smell AMAZING, bed and pillows A++,driveway parking! easy house to find if you forget things like us and use doordash or to order dinner in like we did 😊 LOTS of food options around as well as gas stations, vape shops (would recommend planet of the vapes), cafes and more within like 5 miles of this Air BnB. also pretty close to the thruway, if we find ourselves in cleveland we’ll be back for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Title: Fantastic Stay in a Clean and Serene Apartment
Review:
I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this apartment and would give it 5 stars without any hesitation. The apartment was immaculately clean and well-maintained, making it a comfortable and inviting space to relax in.
Located in a lovely and peaceful neighborhood, this apartment provided the perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. The quiet surroundings made for a restful stay, and I appreciated the tranquility it offered.
The host was incredibly friendly and welcoming.
I stayed here while attending a friend’s wedding. I went with my mom and friend and we all enjoyed our stay.
I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a peaceful and comfortable retreat. Thank you to the host for a fantastic experience!"

Stayed one night","I had to come into town to get some medical testing done at Fairview Hospital so I was pleased when I reached out to the host and learned it was only 12-16 minutes away from this rental. The price was great, they called to let me know the cleaner would be stopping by before we arrived, and when we got there it was spotless. The road is a bit broken up, but it's a quiet area with a little public park just down the street. Perfect location for hospital visits, great communication, and there's even a nice sitting area in the backyard! Only thing I didn't love was getting a bit warm in the middle of the night and needing to crack the windows and wait for it to cool down a bit in there. Would totally book again!"

The place is on a dead end road that is not the best paved road. But overall the Airbnb did not disappoint. We were 5-15 minute drives from most of the restaurants/attractions we did so not walking distance but still quite convenient. The host was great and responded quickly! Overall a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","I was in town for a wedding and needed someplace close to the airport that wouldn't break the bank. This was the perfect little place for one person, although it would be just fine for a couple as well. I didn't use the kitchen at all so I can't speak to that although it looked to be pretty bare bones. The bathroom was roomy with a full-length mirror and good water pressure. The couch was very clean, Netflix worked without any issues, and the memory foam bed was very comfortable! John was very responsive to my inquiries, even before I booked. He worked with his cleaner to let me check in a bit early so that I could get ready for the wedding, and he was communicative throughout my stay. The studio is on the backside of a house, which did not have any renters when I was there so I had no issues with noise. It's in a more industrial area near the freeway but it's on a dead end street so it felt safe and quiet. My only suggestion is to provide more pillows!"

It does seem like me a two-unit house, so there is a noise machine set up in the kitchen area to try and mitigate any noise getting across from one unit to the other but it definitely gives the impression that it’s best for a quiet stay. Check in is really easy with the touch code entry too which is nice. We really only had to contact our hosts once during our stay as there was some water damage on the bathroom ceiling that wasn’t shown in the photos, and they were quick to respond."

Stayed one night","VERY clean. Comfortable bed. Little attention to decorating. Amenities moderate. Needs attention to how to use free space in the room to add comfort for guests, i.e. an end table or coffee table for the sofa space. Note that one house rule forbids eating in bed (where the bedside tables reside) so if one wants to relax somewhere other than the kitchen table, one has no place to put one’s water glass.
Parking for this unit is generally on the street. I was allowed to park in the driveway because the other unit was not occupied. I would have been less comfortable leaving my full car on the street.
The host was very generous in letting me know prior to my arrival that an issue in the adjoining unit might affect my unit. It didn’t sound too onerous, and in fact it did not affect me. I appreciated the heads up and the potential for me to cancel my stay.
If you are looking for an overnight stay, this offering is perfectly adequate."

Stayed a few nights","We are originally from the Cleveland area and return often. We have some favorite restaurants in the Tremont and surrounding areas.
When we return we like to stay somewhere safe and central and again we stayed in Tremont. This condo and location was absolutely perfect. Extremely easy access to freeway ramps, incredible view of the Cleveland skyline (from roof top deck), and very peaceful for great night rest.
Great area to walk, coffee shops, dine, and enjoy night life.
We prepared a dish for a family gathering and everything in the kitchen was operational, oven/stove top was gas and very nice. Everything we needed was available!
Dishware / glassware was nice as well. We enjoyed wine and some Great Lakes beer while on the roof top deck.
We used the washer/dryer for a quick load of laundry…and the stacked units worked great.
We will definitely return here…possibly this summer for a Tremont Art Walk.
Brians team was great to work with - highly recommend!"

The most notable issue was the smell, and after a couple of days we discovered there was something sitting in the bottom of the garbage disposal that was the likely culprit. Also the bed was not very comfortable. The host was fairly responsive and definitely was kind, but the cumbersome 3rd party app for identity verification and check in made check in a little harder than it needed to be."

Then you walk outside to the seating/fireplace overlooking the river, and you will never want to leave. Valhalla is worth a visit if you're ever in the area looking for a place to stay.

We stayed during springtime, but I imagine the view overlooking the river is a treat in any of the other 3 seasons. There was quite a bit of wildlife, including 3 deer crossing the river for the perfect viewing. We absolutely loved the deck overlooking the river.
Ryan was extremely responsive in communicating. My wife and I had such a comfortable stay that surpassed all expectations. I am sure we will be returning."

The bed was comfortable and the entire house was clean. The wood burning fireplace (a very unique item) was used nightly as it snowed while we were there.
The sunroom with floor to ceiling windows created the most relaxing environment as you sip your coffee and take in the river.

Ryan’s is also en excellent host. I was in town for a trade show and we had a pretty big snowstorm blow thru so there was a lot of snow on the ground.
He made sure the driveway was safe and accessible so I could get in and out for the show. He was out there shoveling snow at 8am in the morning marking sure I wouldn’t have any issues. That is good customer service!
Overall, excellent experience. Would highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","From the pictures and description, we knew this AirBnb was going to work well for our visit. But, Ryan’s home was more beautiful than we ever expected. The furniture was incredibly comfortable and the décor was elegant. I loved the many soft blankets placed around the livingroom and sitting room. We all agreed that our beds were super comfy. The backyard was so calming with the rushing river and the wildlife. We saw eagles!
Ryan was at our service as needed with questions and we had him stop by to show us how to use the fireplace. Don’t miss that! The closeness of the airport was a plus for us and though the planes flew over, the house itself seems to be well insulated against the noise.
I can’t say enough. Our stay was perfect. Thank you, Ryan, for all the extra caring touches and your hospitality."

Stayed with kids",We can’t say enough wonderful things about this property or Ryan as a host. Every minute of our stay was special and comfortable and relaxing. The setting was stunning and so peaceful and such a pleasant surprise. We booked super last min for a last min family get away to the National park and expected a nice place but we were blown away when we got there. We even booked another stay in November bc we’ll be visiting family in Solon for thanksgiving and wanted to add on another visit to this special place. Can’t wait to go back. It truly was like heaven for our whole family. Kids loved it too!! Only wish we had more time to enjoy the outside amenities which were amazing. Thank you Ryan!!

Group trip","This home is hard to explain but if you like the pictures then just imagine 10 times better in person. The property is incredible and the interior of the home is such a beautiful yet comfy vibe. You have a beautiful private view of the falls and are still only a 5 minute drive to stores, pharmacies, and a ton of food! A tree fell the day we arrived and the power was out for the first night and most of our 2nd day at the home, but Ryan was amazing and got us candles and flashlights and checked in on us to make sure we were ok! The home and property is so incredible that even having no power didn’t hinder our visit! We are so excited for our next excuse to visit! Don’t think twice about booking this place, especially if you are celebrating or want a romantic getaway! The master bedroom is far away from the upstairs bedrooms, so there is plenty of space to have a romantic getaway, even if you bring friends, family, or kids! 100000/10!"

Stayed with kids","Ryan's place is an unexpected hidden gem tucked away in a nice neighborhood. It is accurately described and depicted and has everything you could possibly need. You can see the thought put into making it feel like home, in comforts like throw blankets, a well stocked kitchen and pantry, toys for kids and plenty of extra items-you may need or forgot to pack. Really thoughtful touches, throughout.
The setting is tranquil on the rivers edge and beautifully landscaped/decorated, with many outdoor seating options to enjoy.
This was a much needed respite from our current reality at home where our island has recently suffered devastating wildfires. We are grateful for this time and wonderful space to rest, grieve and allow our Ohio family a place to staycation with us, together. The kids had a great time too with plenty of space and toys to keep them entertained.
Ryan is a great, responsive and proactive host. I appreciate our genuine exchanges and his generosity. We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","Ryan’s house is beautiful. The backyard is one of kind and peaceful.
Host was initially considerate and helpful, allowing an hour early check-in. However, issues occurred the first night of our stay, with Ryan wanting to charge $240 extra for visitors to have a two hour dinner (i.e. wanting to charge a visitor as an overnight guest additional fee). We had 3 adults and 1 infant in this large home listed for 8 for two nights as guests, and host wanted to charge us to have 5 family members join for a 2 hour dinner one evening.
Ryan texted my personal phone and messaged on Airbnb app quite frequently during my stay with concerns and questions he had. The communications could be unpleasant in tone. This unfortunately negatively impacted our stay and overall vacation. Host also monitored the outdoor cameras throughout our stay, taking away from any outdoor privacy during our stay.
Beautiful outdoor area. There was loud overhead noise from being near airport/flight path."

Stayed a few nights","Pictures do not do it justice. This home is a true gem. We thought it was too good to be true when I saw it on Airbnb. I never knew such home existed in Olmstead Falls. We all lit up upon entering. The view of the river is spectacular. It is tastefully furnished with a blend of old-world charm and a modern twist. The openness of the layout and the abundance windows provide an inviting space for family gatherings while enjoying the stunning grounds. There are multiple outdoor spaces to lounge, but our favorite is hanging out on the deck that cantilevers over the river while enjoying the scene and sound of the river. Our family appreciated the ensuite bedrooms and the grand kitchen and its amenities.
This is a home and not just an estate so please be respectful to the owner.
Ryan was very responsive and accommodating. We also had the honor of meeting his son, Jett, who’s spirits just radiate this home even when he’s not around. Thank Ryan and Jett, for sharing your home!"

Matthias recommended a perfect spot within walking distance of his unit and even loaned us chairs to use. He also graciously packed up and mailed my husband's iPad that he'd left behind. Matthias's unit was exactly as described in his listing and it was nice to find a supply of coffee in the kitchenette. We took advantage of a couple of his useful restaurant recommendations. We felt the bed was too soft for our aging bodies, however. And the price was quite high, but given how packed Cleveland was at that time, not surprisingly so."

Very nice wide open space. Overall it was a nice place.

Stayed one night",Stayed here for one night only but it was such a great stay! Location is close to many restaurants and bars. Went to a couple places Matthias recommended and had such a fun time. Street parking is very easy and the neighborhood is quiet. Would stay here again if we’re ever back in the area!

Stayed one night","Nice night in Ohio City! Tho we didn’t spend the evening in Ohio city, it’s clear that it would’ve been a short and convenient walk there or to Tremont. From the street you can see a number of the skyscrapers across the way which was a cool. The place was clean and just enough room for the night. Communication was great and the shower head was high quality.
Just a few complaints/areas to improve.
The description of the place does state this, but the unit is below a main house. Could hear others walking in the morning. It wasn’t loud, but it is a different feel compared to other place’s guest houses. I got into the place pretty late. I spent a good amount of time walking around looking for the house number. It’s pretty visible during the day, however. Also we were given two towels and hand towels but no washrags. Lastly, mini shampoo bottles were provided but there was no soap or body wash that we could find. I would expect those things to be available. Otherwise it was a great stay!"

Matthias's place was easy to find and the instructions for getting inside were simple. The location was great -- walkable to downtown, Ohio City, and Tremont neighborhoods. There was plenty of room on the street to park. The space itself (which is like a completely separate and furnished downstairs basement) was clean and had plenty of space for 2 people. The bed and the couch were both very comfortable. I appreciate Matthias's hospitality and would definitely stay again the next time I visit Cleveland."

It was easy to get into the accommodation. AND when I locked us out of the side door (as there weren't instructions on how to lock up as we left, the host graciously/quickly let us back in as he was home upstairs).
The bed was comfortable and the shower was wonderful.
However, it was odd to me that instead of a double/queen-sized bed spread, there were two twin covers that my partner and I used (felt like we were in two beds/didn't have enough covers."

Located in a nice area with convenient public transit; the Cleveland RTA Red Line train has a stop several blocks away and this train line goes directly to the airport (about 7 stops away) and to downtown (1 stop away). Check-in was simple. A couple of packets were provided with information on the Airbnb and things to do nearby. The Airbnb was well-furnished and well-decorated with amenities provided as described. One of the few downsides was the lack of a washer. However, this may not be an issue for shorter stays. Otherwise I went to a local laundromat that took about 15 min to get to (walking to bus stop + taking the bus)."

Three windows allow daylight into the unit which is furnished with a comfortable bed, convertible sofa, and desk area along with a kitchenette area and full, private bathroom. We were able to walk to restaurants and to Progressive Field for a few Guardians' games. Matthias is a great host; very responsive and helpful before and during our stay. I hope to stay here again for future trips to Cleveland!"

The shower was a favorite - so many cool jets. The bed was comfortable. There's a cool park across the street - fun to swing on the swing set. The location was near downtown without being downtown. I will definitely try to rebook if I come back to Cleveland."

Stayed a few nights","Brandi's place is a block away from Playhouse Square, so if you're looking to be close to the theaters this is the place to be. That said, the bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned (yellow-brown stains on the floor), and the bedroom was very hard to sleep in. The apartment has builder basic metal blinds, that block out very little light. That wouldn't be so bad, except there are extremely bright street lights right outside the wall-sized windows. It was bright enough to read a book without issue. The brightness, combined with the street noise (unavoidable in any downtown area), made it nearly impossible to get good sleep. Had I known, I would have brought an eye mask. It was also a challenge to find parking nearby, and the street signs were really unclear as to when it was legal to park. If you're wanting to rest well and easily, I would look elsewhere."

Stayed a few nights","have to say the hosts were lovely. But need to warn those out these. This is not a nice neighborhood, I go to school in Cleveland and came here to visit to see some friends. Parking lot is in a sketchy alleyway, although secure, entire building has the same code, fairly easy to guess. Whole complex smelled of weed and lots of noises throughout the place. There is no table, that was shown in the photos and the carpet and bedding had lots of stains. The floors also seemed to be coated in something sticky. However the bathroom was nice and the hosts were very receptive to the comment I provided for them. However it was a cheap place, so I understand it’s okay for what I paid for. That considered the photos were misleading. But there are cleaners and some of this is totally out of the owners control, just need to state this for future guests"

My husband, 8-yr-old son, and I loved that we could walk to Little Italy and the Cleveland Museum of Art as well as to the train station to go downtown. This is a no-frills apartment in an old building that’s a little rough around the edges (e.g., signs of water damage, slowly draining bathtub) but the apartment is clean, the bed was comfy, and the hosts were very responsive. We rented it to see the eclipse so the rates were understandably higher than normal for us, otherwise I think it is usually a good deal especially due to the location."

I would book here again if we came back.
Only feedback: We had asked for a second queen air bed to be set up ahead of our arrival, which was missing and we had to check with them. It would have been nice if they had inflated it and given sheets and a comforter for the additional bed. They dropped off the bed after pinging them once we arrived."

Next time, I will book this spot for just myself and husband. The space is super clean with lovely decoration and detail. Well equipped kitchen which is something I always worry about. We left in such a hurry that I gave no thought to breakfast so the fact that there were english muffins, eggs, yogurts, fruit and soda water was such a nice treat! The dedicated parking spot in front is the best and the location is central to anything CLE you might want to do. I see in the reviews that there are repeat guests at this property and we will certainly join their ranks."

They provide breakfast foods, drinks, and fruit in the fridge in addition to the many other amenities. The flat is very clean and comfortable and there is a lovely private outdoor space to sit and read or enjoy a glass of wine. The bed and linens make for a great sleep, and the shower is great. I love walking in the neighborhood and Gordon Square offers a number of good restaurants and some shops as well as a movie theater all in walking distance. You can also walk or ride a bicycle on a path along Lake Erie that is a short walk or ride from Eve's place. Eve's place is also a short drive to Ohio City, the Westside Market, and the Tremont neighborhood. I'm so grateful for this home away from home in Cleveland and hope to return."

Her home was just like the pictures, but way better in person. The home is beautifully updated and has all of the touches of home. It was sparkling clean and adorable. The bathroom looks like it is right out of a magazine and it was the best shower of my life! I loved that she had extra amenities like make up wipes, ibuprofen, and body wash. I loved the body wash! The bed was super comfortable too!
We had a few questions about the location and Eve was amazing at responding quickly and giving us great recommendations.
After dinner, we went to her recommended bar- Stone Mad. The bar was walkable and super fun! We had a great time.
The place is beautiful, located in a great neighborhood, and close to everything! We will definitely be back! Thanks Eve!"

The place is even bigger & BETTER than the pictures, and there are so many extra touches that take a lot of the “friction” away and make it feel like a restful stay (examples: staple food & beverages pre-stocked in the kitchen, same for toiletries). My wife, who is scrupulous about cleanliness, declared it “the cleanest place we’ve ever stayed.” Neighborhood is great as well - lots of restaurants in walking distance, or at most a short drive.

The apartment itself was lovely with thoughtful amenities that aren't expensive but I somehow forget to bring (swabs, bandaids, makeup remover wipes).

Stayed one night","The home is an inspiring beauty. We stayed overnight on our road trip to the East Coast, and it was such a clean, and comfy space. The bed was so comfortable, we slept like babies.
The only issue with the home was that the microwave didn’t work, which was unfortunate because as vegans we had our own food pre-made that we had hoped to heat up quickly after a long drive. However the stove and oven quickly fixed that problem.
I would definitely stay again. And would love to take advantage of the back yard, which looked so cute. For neighborhood amenities, I highly recommend Gypsy Beans for walkable treats, like great lattes and delicious bagels.
Overall, a gem of an AirBnb! Don’t hesitate to book your trip today!"

There was also a binder of helpful information about places to eat and we were able to borrow bikes from Eve to ride around town. My husband enjoyed talking to Chris who designed everything and my son enjoyed talking around in the huge yard. All-in-all this may be one of the best Airbnb we have stayed at. We felt right at home!

Great neighborhood and really close to Edgewater Park, restaurants, breweries, etc. We were bicycle riding the OTET Trail from Cleveland to Cincy, and we stayed here the night before our departure. It couldn't have been more perfect. We walked a block to a lovely dinner, and the next morning we packed up and rode our bikes a very short distance to the start of the trail at Edgewater Park. Very clean, modern and well-appointed. A very good experience and highly recommended."

My sister (and MOH) worked with Eve who let her in early so she could decorate before I and the others arrived. This was sooo nice because it helped my sister pull off a total surprise for me.

Stayed a few nights","Me and my BFF made plans to run the Cleveland Christmas run but a few weeks before, it was cancelled. We decided to go to Cleveland for the weekend anyway even though Keith has a super flexible cancellation policy.
We had a great time! Keith gave detailed instructions to get us into the building and apartment as well as the inside scoop on parking. We had no problems.
The apartment is perfectly located between Public Square and the waterfront. We walked everywhere. There is a coffee shop a block away and Insomnia Cookies was just around the corner. For an apartment building, it was astonishingly quiet and I didn't notice any street noise either.
The space has a definite steam punk vibe with cool light switches and fixtures. The layout of the apartment was nice and big windows overlook the street. The murphy bed was fun and comfy and the kitchen had what we needed. The space was clean and tidy. Overall, we loved our stay and would stay at Keith's again!"

I would absolutely recommend based on this alone, but I should mention that Keith was the perfect host. He was available and responded immediately to all my messages, but kept to himself otherwise.

The Convention Center, Rock and Roll Hall of fame, USS Cod, and Progressive Field were a few places we walked to.
Keith was kind enough to check in on us the morning after our arrival to ensure all was well and made some great recommendations for things to do in the area.
The space itself was clean and comfortable. I could easily have spent more time in the space if the weather had not been great enough to be out exploring the city. Large enough for 4 people comfortably.
Overall, I would definitely recommend and will try to stay here again if I ever return to Cleveland."

Keith was always responsive with a lot of information about the check in process and parking in the area. Parking was $30 a night on all the lots around it and the are parking spaces on the street across the building that might be cheaper, so be prepared and take lots of coins with you.
We would definitely recommend this apartment and it will be our first choice next time we visit the city."

Stayed a few nights","What an awesome location! Super easy to get into. Parking was extremely easy, but did have to pay like noted in the post. Most everything is walking distance from the place. Very clean and homey! As noted it can be noisy at night around 230 it was loud but it quieted down quickly. Overall everything explained was true, very happy with our stay!"

If you stay on a warm Saturday night beware: the hot rods and motorcycles will be loud and going by once a minute until 3:15 AM. This made it impossible for me to sleep. Colder Friday night was fine though."

Stayed a few nights","This place was great! Right in the middle of all the action. This place was perfect for four adults. Easy walk to the science museum , rock and roll hall of fame, and all of the stadiums. It has everything you will need for your stay. There is comfortable furniture and good TV if you need to relax at home. The pace is clean and Kieth was very considerate and quick to respond."

Stayed with kids",Great stay. Keith was very communicative and everything went as expected. The location was fantastic and the unit was clean with a view of Terminal Tower. You do need to pay to park in a public lot over night but I didn’t see this as too much of a problem- just add that in to your cost of stay.

Stayed a few nights","Keith was a great host and very responsive with a smooth check-in. The spot is in great proximity to the so may attractions, many within reasonable walking distance. There were also many electric scooters and rental bikes spotted around that would have been a great option to get around in warmer months. Adjacent parking was a bit pricey for overnights during our stay, but was very secure with an attendant on site and even had an EV charger for us."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay. Location is just perfect and walk distance to everything we had planned and wanted to do. The place is absolutely adorable. There is everything you need to cook if you want to go to the store tomorrow a meal. There is a market close by, lots of options of restaurants and things to do. Keith was super helpful as well and communication was easy. Thank you for the wine waiting for us. :)
Parking is also easy as there is a paid parking next door to the building and across the street. Also plenty parking meters around that could be an option. We parked our cars for the weekend and just walked the whole time.
Would love to come back again and stay there.
Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","This place is so cute and quaint. Extremely well decorated and comfortable. Very convenient, I’m glad we didn’t have a car. We took the train from the airport (an entire adventure in it’s self) to Tower City and walked through the park to the unit. Super easy even in the cold. Food places open around 4 on Saturday so something to consider. We took Lyft everywhere and was way cheaper than a rental. Our favorite part were the privacy shades. Slept in late to a pitch black apartment you can’t beat that. Plenty of tv options if you want to stay in. Host was very helpful and responsive. I could say more but I’ll just say it was almost the best thing we experienced in Cleveland 🤷🏾‍♂️"

Stayed a few nights","Keith's loft ticks all the boxes for a great Cleveland stay. The check in and communication were seamless and Keith is super friendly, with lots of great recommendations. The space itself if spotlessly clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. A well stocked kitchen , good coffee , lush towels, a very comfortable bed. The area could not be better situated with many good neighbourhood bars and restaurants within walking distance. The loft itself is very spacious and artfully decorated. The building is quiet and parking is very convenient. All in all , a great stay. Would definitely highly recommend and can't wait to visit again."

Stayed a few nights","Keith was a great host! Very easy to reach if anything came up. The space was clean & stylish & fun & very centrally located -- it was super easy to get around. My only complaint would be the noise that we experienced from a street facing apartment and loud neighbors. I would not recommend staying here if you are looking for a extremely quiet getaway. If you're looking to experience the hustle and bustle of a downtown apartment on the other hand, this place might be better suited for you."

Stayed a few nights","It’s a very nice, cute little space. It’s nicely decorated, very touristy. Everything was very clean. The bed is a full so two people can sleep in there but fulls are fulls.
They also have a bed in a closet for additional sleep room. The kitchen was also a full kitchen, it even has some extra stuff too. The location was nice, you are centered between a lot of things. The only downside is you do have to pay for parking but you can park majority of the time on the street. He’s also great on the communication side, any questions I had were answered relatively fast."
