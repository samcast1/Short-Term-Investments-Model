Stayed with kids","Expectations were high. Expectations were blown away when we arrived! We absolutely loved this house and all the amenities. From the layout of the lagoon to the huge wide open living space to the plentiful space to sleep! The lagoon was just awesome with the rope swing, hottub, waterslide, swim up bar!!! Endless entertainment for all 3 families. We had a couple of excursions (grand canyon only 2 hours away, and a boat day) but honestly didn’t really feel like we wanted to leave the house. Kamryn was an amazing host as well with help with a couple minor functional issues. Of note: We had 3 senior boys with us that the casita was perfect for including the pool table in there with them. Would defintely rent this again. 6 stars no doubt!"

The pool and landscape are even more incredible in-person and we were enjoying the water everyday. The location is perfectly close to both bars and the beach. The house was equipped for everything we needed! Would definitely recommend booking a stay!"

Group trip","From looking at the photos and descriptions alone, we already had high expectations. When we arrived at the property, our expectations were blown away. We stayed at this property with 12 guests, and it easily accommodated all of us. The kitchen was huge and had everything we could've needed, the living room was also very spacious and easily fit all of us. The outdoor and pool area were absolutely amazing. From booking our stay all the way to checkout, Kamryn was always responsive and worked with us the whole way, always being available for any questions or anything we may have needed. I would 100 percent stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone who is considering a stay out here. Thank you Chris and Kamryn!"

Group trip","We stayed at Lake Havasu Lagoon for our daughter’s 14th birthday. this home is absolutely gorgeous and the pool is out of this world! The pool boasts a hot tub, a bridge with a rope to swing on, and a very beautiful water feature with a waterslide. This property is extremely luxurious with amenities for everyone! The home was large enough to easily accommodate our family and several friends. This home comes with everything you could possibly need, including a fully stocked, gourmet kitchen, an outdoor kitchen perfect for entertaining, with a large black stone griddle, sink, stovetop, and large TV. The spacious living room has two large TVs perfect for football. above the outdoor kitchen is a large gazebo with plenty of seating for enjoying morning coffee and enjoying the amazing Havasu sunsets with an amazing backdrop of the mountains and lake!! Large spacious bedrooms and huge casita with game room. So many amazing features to this Home! Lake Havasu Lagoon is the perfect get away!!"

We had numerous couples at the home and everyone had their own private area! The kitchen is huge and everything you need is there to cook at home. The teenagers (and adults) could not get out of the pool! The host was super amazing and responsive! I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could. Perfect experience. Perfect home. Perfect host!"

Stayed with kids","My husband had to go to Havasu for a small welding project so we decided to make a quick trip out of it. I am so happy that I booked with Alexis!! This home exceeded my expectations. Lots of entertainment for my 4 boys. The air hockey table, arcade games and swimming pool are just to name a few. I was ecstatic about the massage chairs..after the long car ride there they were very much needed. This place is very family friendly. I was worried about staying at a home with a pool because of my young children but all the doors had alarms that you could switch on/off which was very comforting knowing those were available. Kitchen was beautiful, as well as the rest of the home. If you have a baby this place has not 1 but 2 high chairs and all the baby necessities as well. Alexis was an amazing host. We will definitely be coming back to this place soon🙌🏽"

Stayed with kids","Our family vacation and stay at Lake Havesu was great! Prior to arrival Alexis was very quick to respond to questions about the house and amenities. I asked about alarms on the doors to the pool area and she responded that they did not currently but were already considering it, and that she'd try to have them installed before our stay. They were installed and ready by the time we checked in about 2 weeks later! The extra safety with having 3 young children was priceless and so much appreciated! Check in was easy, and the house is beautiful and very clean. It is spacious and well equipped. The pool and spa is perfect, my kids swam for hours and we relaxed in the hot tub after bed time. Grill and patio area is spacious, comfortable, and very private. The arcade and theater/projector was a fun bonus and made it easy for us to have a little peaceful coffee time in the morning! Overall a great stay, excellent hostess, and beautiful home! We will not hesitate to book again!"

Group trip","We stayed 5 weeks at Alexis' house and overall it was perfect for our group and roughly 15 minutes from downtown . The house is nice, clean and as described. The layout worked for our family, with the master on one side of the house.
All rooms are large and spacious and beds are comfortable. Kitchen has simple basics for cooking, lots of bath & pool towels. The back yard, living room and theatre room are all as described and were great for hanging out and relaxing. It was too cool for us to use the pool however we used the spa every day and it was a nice feature to have. The other great feature is the garage access. It's nice to have your vehicle secure and climate controlled and makes for easy packing/unpacking of groceries and your luggage.
There was a very minor issue with the house upon arrival and with a simple message to Alexis she had it fixed immediately. She checked in mid-stay to ensure we were comfortable, and all around she was a great host."

When we entered the home the house was at a nice 73 degrees 😁 A big thank you ! To top is off we were welcomed with a pack of cookies and cinnamon rolls 🤤 It’s the little things to make you feel welcomed. The house was perfect. The rooms are a nice size plenty of room so you are not all in one sitting area . Pool is clean and refreshing. We parked inside the RV parking (which is air conditioned) another thank you . Easy to unload and pack up. The arcade/movie room wow talk about a good time. Kids had so much fun . You can tell Alexis really put thought into what a family may need and how to make their stay comfortable. We will definitely be booking again in the future!
Thank you Alexis see you next year :)"

Thank you so much! The coffee bar was my favorite part they provided everything needed for Vice and there was even hot teas and hot chocolate. I forgot to bring a swing for my 3 month old and found out there was a swing which made my trip even better! The awesome accommodations for little ones was amazing. We definitely took advantage all amenities this home had to offer. Everything about this house and host made our stay as if we were home. The house was sparkling clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. This will be my go to house for my annual family vacation.

Stayed with kids","LOOK NO FURTHER, (seriously stop searching, you found your place😊). This is the BEST AIRBNB we’ve ever stayed in.
My family and I were so pleased with our stay at Alexis’s place, we didn’t want to leave. Everything was perfect. We were in a super quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. The house was gorgeous, inside and out!!! The house felt safe and inviting and there is so much to do! I had more fun in the arcade than my kids. 😂 The beds were so comfortable and we all felt rested.
The pool and outdoor space felt like we were at a luxury resort. It was clean, beautiful and relaxing.
Pro tip: Enjoy a cup of coffee on the patio and watch the hillside come to life with beautiful doves, quails, roadrunners.
The spa was perfect, especially in the evenings with the color changing LED’s.
Alexis was so kind. She went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. It’s hosts like her that make me choose an Airbnb over a hotel. Our family is grateful we stayed here. Seriously, book it!"

Stayed with kids","Visiting as a multi-family group, we were very lucky to find this property. Alexis was a fantastic host, very quick to respond throughout the entire process and very accommodating making it very easy for us to enjoy our vacation getaway. We fell in love with this place as it was extremely peaceful especially for five children/infants (ages 1-5). Alexis went above and beyond to ensure we had enough high chairs/pack-n-plays available which helped with planning for space constraints in our vehicles. It was a perfect hot weekend to jump in the pool and use the RV garage to keep our vehicles cool. The game room was popular with access to every app we utilize and the massage chairs were needed after spending all day on the lake. Will definitely return on our next trip!"

Stayed with kids","We rented Alexis’s property in April of 2023 for a multi-family vacation. Alexis was extremely responsive, even when we were just inquiring about her home prior to booking, and remained so through our entire planning process and the length of our stay. We had a total group of 14 (2 sets of parents and all of our children ranging in ages from 10-23), and this home worked perfectly for us. The kitchen/dining/living areas in the center of the home were even bigger than expected-plenty of storage space in kitchen and refrigerator/freezer and lots of counter space for cooking/eating.
The game room with massage chairs was a huge hit for our whole group, but especially the 4 boys. Backyard with patio dining, pool and hot tub was the favorite spot for all of us to enjoy the sun, and forget about Northern MN winter that hasn’t yet quit.
Alexis went above and beyond for our group, and the attention to detail in her property speaks so much. Cannot wait to return to this gem of a space!"

Stayed with kids","Wow, our family just had the best vacation ever thanks to Alexis's beautiful home. It was like having our own private resort. She is an amazing host and had a nice treat and hand written card waiting for us when we arrived after a long drive from Utah. The house was everything she described in her listing. She even had a welcome booklet in each room to acclimate us to the house and area which provided some good options as to where to shop and dine. The home theater was the best ever and included leather massage chairs to smooth sore muscles after a long day of biking and kayaking on the lake. The location was better than expected and just far enough away from stores to have maximum privacy. In fact, we rode our electric bikes from the house to the London Bride and back. I wouldn't recommend on mountain bikes due to the long hill climb on the way back. We will definitely be staying here again as there is no need to look further."

Stayed with kids","We were so pleased with our stay at Alexis’s place. We were her first guests and were so impressed with Alexis as a host and with the Airbnb. The home was perfect for our group of 4 adults and 6 kids. The kitchen had the essentials we needed and an impressive coffee bar. We appreciated the extra family friendly items like a high chair, playpen, and board games, and the welcome treats. The weather wasn’t ideal so we appreciated having the spa and the option to pay extra to have the pool heated - the pool is beautiful and the kids loved being able to swim. Due to the low temperatures we did have a minor issue with the pool heat one day, but Alexis was so good with proactively communicating with us and making arrangements to have it fixed ASAP, as well as refunding is a portion of the heating costs. The games + movie theatre room in the garage was a highlight for our kids. Alexis was so responsive to all messages and amazing to deal with. We highly recommend her place!"

It was tight inside, especially from the fridge back to the bedroom, but he was able to make it work. Kitchen and bathroom are both nicely updated. The bed was soft and we thought it was comfortable.
We were in town visiting an event near the London Bridge. It was nice to drive to the end of the island where it was much more quiet, at least in January."

Steven's place has to be one of the best locations in Havasu. Both sunsets and rises from the porch were amazing, the view of the lake is unbelievable, and while the area was quiet at night, you're still very close to town and all the restaurants/bars/action etc.
The cabin itself is small, but very comfortable and cozy, with a very nice kitchen and bathroom setup, multiple large smart TVs and a comfortable large bed. And who are we kidding, you'll be spending most of your time out on the deck anyway!
The lounge area on said deck was super comfortable and even had mounted fans if the heat got too bad, plus easy access outdoor outlets for various gizmos. The jacuzzi on the porch gives a feeling of pure luxury and was very welcome after exploring the lake all day.
All in all this is a rental you won't regret visiting. It really is a gem."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful view on a great deck & although a bit rocky & unkept, direct water access - the location was nice. It was a last minute trip, wanted water access from the spot we picked, and not many options available. While we did get that, at over $500 a night I also expected the place itself to be a bit better; it felt not ready for us. It was not very clean, personal items around & the outside area where we wanted to be more needs new/cleaned up furniture. The furniture was all stained and some pcs broken. The host was nice, stays near by and did assist when asked. He allows pets too, which is a super plus for us! For a bit less per night the location makes it worth it."

It was our first time. The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. The large deck was the best feature. We loved the view, the comfortable seating, and the hot tub. The community was very safe and friendly. We explored the neighborhood on the golf cart provided. The small issue we had was quickly addressed by Steven who was a very nice and caring host. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you rent a boat for your stay. We rented a Pontoon boat and traveled around the Lake and River and it was one of the best parts of our trip (besides the deck)!

It’s our second time renting the home and it was better than the first time. The star gazing at night is so relaxing . You can even see the Milky Way and some shooting stars on a clear night.
It’s fun to watch boaters and jet skiers go by and wave at them. Just below is your own private little oasis swimming area . The resort as a whole has everything you need. There is a marina just 5 min down the road if you want to rent out boats or jet skis.
The space was so clean. The bed is super comfy. The shades in the living room are super helpful if someone is sleeping on the pull out couch and
Keeps the room dark.
It’s worth every penny. Don’t hesitate to book the space , you will be happy you did!!"

There is a misting system on the porch so you can relax in the heat, every type of utensil and pot/pan you need to cook with. (I’ve stayed at a few Airbnb’s that literally had 2 glasses and 1 was broken kinda deal) the a/c keeps the rooms freezing cold in the heat and the bed and pillows couldn’t have been more comfortable.

Stayed one night","What a gem! This was an amazing spot to stay if you are looking to relax in Havasu. I only booked a day with my 16 year old twins for my birthday and we enjoyed every minute of our stay! The view from the deck was amazing and you have your own little private beach area! Highly recommend staying here. My twins and I didn’t wanna leave! We normally go out there with watercraft but we enjoyed floating on the river relaxing. Next door neighbor Chuck was so sweet to offer my daughters his floating mats that they enjoyed so much! You don’t need a boat or personal watercraft to have fun!
That sunset and sunrise view was breathtaking! We’ll definitely be back! Thank you, Steven!"

Stayed a few nights",My husband and I have been coming to Havasu for 10 years and this year I thought I would do something special for him and this place was it. My husband sat all morning and in the evenings on the patio looking at all the boats and admiring the lake view. Very comfortable and relaxing. The views are amazing! This place was super cute and cozy. Very clean. My puppy enjoyed himself too. Steven was very accommodating to our situation when we needed to reschedule. This place is a great getaway!

We launched our kayak right from the property. Power boats could be parked very close by in the resort. The home is updated with modern kitchen and bath, and appliances. We were pleasantly surprised with the RO filtered water in the kitchen. There are plenty of AC units in the house to keep it cold in the summer heat. The deck is half covered and uncovered, which was perfect for any time of day or weather condition. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Lake Havasu."

We circled the island on jet skis and didn’t see a single property that looked like a nicer spot than this! Not only was the location spot on, the interior was beautiful as well. Sleek updated kitchen and the shower was to die for. My husband and I are now shopping for a new shower unit that we didn’t even know we needed until we enjoyed this one! We’re looking forward to enjoying this special place again in the future. You won’t be disappointed."

Stayed with kids","I would have just sat on the deck and enjoyed the view for the 2 days/nights & had been happy! Luckily my husband and children got me moving. We didn’t bring a boat but we did have inflatable inner tubes which were great fun in the community pool AND the lake which has access just steps down from Steven’s place. (Swim shoes may be helpful for little ones.)
We took a sunset cruise tour, from the London Bridge area, around the lake which was relaxing and beautiful. Staying in summer meant high temps BUT no crowds and it cools down nicely as the sun sets. Sitting on the deck there’s shady spots and often a cooling breeze. Friendly resort employees and residents. Quiet! It’s an easy drive off the island to any grocery store or the downtown area for picking up a great read or ice cream from Scoops. There’s a walking and bike path on the island. Steven responded right away with a few questions we had. AC works great and the sofa bed was comfy for the kiddos, just need blinds on the sliding door so sunrise doesn’t wake them too early!"

A small, clean, newly remodeled place with a huge outside deck overlooking the lake. We had coffee watching the sunrise and dinner watching the sunset...and we couldn't have been happier. The mobile home park has boat slips available so no pulling the boat in and out of the water everyday, and a golf cart was available to get our stuff to/from the dock. A staircase leads down to a little rocky shoreline with a patio with two chairs where we could jump in the water for a quick dip. When we had questions Steven was quick to respond and problem-solve. Upon leaving, my husband and I both said we couldn't wait to come back!"

The first day we arrived we were blown away by the view from the deck of the beautiful lake and mountains. Seven has his patio furniture perfectly placed on his deck. There is access to the lake from the dock by a stairway it’s kind of like a hidden beach tucked away in mangroves! No need to go to a public beach when you have your private one right here! The inside is beautifully remodeled I can tell all the love and care that went in to the remodel. The place was comfortable the air conditioning worked great all tho we did not need it much with the breeze off the lake. The shower is a league of its own just wanted to keep staying under there. Our stay was so wonderful I’m definitely finding out my next days off so we can getaway here agin.

As the home is out over lake the living room slider is east facing and with no blinds it does get bright in the room very early. While our kids didn't seem to mind, some adults might?

Group trip","Michelles place was amazing, we had our boats and two skies. We were able to park in the driveway with no issues there was plenty of space and also an RV parking. The place was so clean and the ac was already turned on before we arrived. We arrived early in the morning and went to straight to lake our checkin was at 3pm but by 10am Michelle told us place was ready for us and we could check-in early free of any charges. Pool is amazing the bar area is perfect with speakers and a fridge. The house was just amazing kitchen is full of kitchenware. This home is everything you need for a perfect get away. Will stay again"

The location and value is phenomenal and the place is clean with such a wonderful host and the most friendly Corgis (she didn’t let them out until we said it was okay!) This place is well beyond stocked with everything you could possibly think of…which is such a bonus if you’re like me and always forget a few things! Amy communicated so well throughout our stay and the check in was detailed and easy. The pool was so refreshing to be in with plenty of pool toys and floaties. We didn’t use the BBQ but it was nice to have if needed. My husband and I would gladly stay here again. The host and her husband are both such kind people!

I can’t think of anything to complain about even if I tried! It was incredibly clean, had everything you possibly need which for somebody who hates packing, I really appreciated that, it’s in a beautiful neighborhood, the house was gorgeous, parking was very accessible and convenient which is hard to come across when you drive a flat bed work truck, and Amy was always super quick to respond and even gave us a 15 minute extension on our checkout when we needed it. I’m very satisfied with our stay and will most definitely be returning at least once every 2 weeks for work!"

The apartment is tastefully appointed with modern flooring, countertops, furniture and decor. The quality of towels, linens, kitchen appliances and gadgets, etc., was notable. The hosts provided nice touches, like snacks and a vase of fresh flowers. We had no problems preparing a curry dinner and pancake breakfast in a nicely appointed full kitchen. The bed was really comfortable, and it was quiet at night for a good night’s sleep. There was more than ample onsite parking for our Sprinter van. The apartment is in a nice safe residential neighborhood."

The room was super clean, comfortable, cute, had everything we needed, and far better than imagined. My husband and I after staying in 4 other airbnbs in the past two weeks both agreed that this one was by far the best one. We loved swimming in the pool and my husband and I enjoyed our late night snacks (that were provided) after putting our toddler to bed. We stayed at the HOTTEST time of the year, but we slept like babies both nights because the air condition and fan worked amazing. I have nothing but good to say about this place. Both Amy and her husband and doggos are all just the sweetest. We will be back!
Thank you so much for everything!"

Amy and her husband, her daughter and their 3 little corgis are some of the kindest and most hospitable they are. They are friendly, you feel like your talking to friends. And then there’s the Corgis, Bolt, our pool lifeguard, sweet girl Echo, and new little baby Joey who stole my heart. From beginning to end it’s always so great. This will be the only place I stay if I can while in Havasu. This place is A+++++! Amy thinks if all the touches, from kitchen spices, napkins, cold bottles of water, snacks, and so much more and that’s just the kitchen. They bedroom and bathroom are amazing. She thinks if everything again from black wash cloths for those who are taking off make up. Bandaids, shampoo, hair dryer, sun block, pool towels and more. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Amy for an amazing place that was so peaceful! Can’t say thank you enough!"

I almost don’t wanna recommend it to others because I don’t want it to get booked out and I can’t ever go back lol😅 Our stay at Amy’s place was a dream!!! She really made sure that the place felt like a home, and so it’s such a relaxing and comfortable stay no matter the occasion. It’s very close to literally everything so that was a great bonus🤩🙌🏽 Amy also had the whole entire place stocked up with everything you could possibly need, from seasonings to Aloe Vera gel for when you get burnt. We also got to meet her adorable doggies, Bolt and Echo, as well as heralded and her husband. They are some of the most genuine and down to earth people I’ve ever met!!! We’re for sure going to be coming back no questions asked!!! Loved it so much, thanks again to Amy and her family for the amazing place, that just put a cherry on top of our trip💕"

We have a great bed at home, and so, most Airbnb's fall short when it comes to bed comfort. However, Amy's listing had a bed just as comfortable as ours. We had two regrets: not bringing our swimsuits and not opening up the windows when we slept. The nights seemed cold to the local folk but great weather for us Minnesota folk. Many thanks to Amy for her little bungalow and for all the hard work she does."

I didn’t realize the dates changed until after I applied the payment very frustrating. It did end up being a very bad weekend to go to Lake Havasu because all the tour companies are not running. So I ended up canceling my trip altogether. Amy was great and very understanding and allowed me to cancel the reservation with no penalties.

Her place was spotless, cozy, comfortable and inviting. Just when you think she has had filled every need, you find something more thoughtful. From snacks, water, luxurious towels, linens and pillows to a first aid kit and sun tan lotion. Her pool was just as spotless and the night swims were the best. This was my first Airbnb experience and it will be hard to find anything even close to this place. And of course you can’t not mention Echo and Bolt, the 2 resident Corgis who were just as delightful! I would give this place and people a perfect ten!"

The sunsets were simply BREATHTAKING. The tiered lounge pool that spilled into the main swimming pool was a nice touch! Plenty of pool deck space covered and uncovered. The open concept kitchen connected to the living room (which lead to the pool) via a large high top bar counter gave it such an open an inviting feel. Large bedrooms, 2 of which with ensuites, 1 with a fully working large jacuzzi, so fight amongst yourselves for that. My host Brittany was wonderful, very accommodating, very responsive and pleasant. I had an absolute wonderful stay and I highly recommend this property."

Stayed with kids","This is a very clean, thoughtfully furnished and stylishly decorated home in an awesome location. We were beyond comfortable with a very responsive host and a fantastic house to use as home base as we explored the lake and the area. We especially loved the pool / jacuzzi! We actually never ate out but made meals at home and after being out all day had a ritual of a nice swim and a family movie on the Smart TV every night, it was fantastic! (If you're going in the off season I would definitely pay to have the pool & jacuzzi heated, it was AMAZING!) Plenty of storage and space in the kitchen to cook - also really appreciated the stocked supplies with toilet paper, dishwasher soap, extra blankets, etc. -Always a bummer when you get to an airbnb and they've left you one dishwasher tablet & one garbage bag for the week. It felt that the host really wanted to provide a wonderful Airbnb experience and we had a perfect stay because of it. Very highly recommended. Thank you Nicholas!"

While I didn't use the TV much I did appreciate how large it was. What impressed me most about my stay were the brand new memory foam mattresses. These weren't some cheap junk either, I liked the mattress so much I googled it and it was over $700 for a full!! That is a shockingly expensive mattress to find in an AirBnB and all of the rooms had them inluding the 4 full beds in the third room. Suffice it to say me and my friends all slept like babies. The living room & backyard furniture also seemed top notch and the backyard easily accomodated all of us. Oh yeah, and the AC worked great and was easy to use, very improtant! I would definately stay here again."

Google Maps hasnt updated the satellite image yet. Nick was very supportive to assure me this was a rebuild with new pics that matched the address posted.
They did a great job creating a modern, simple, inviting and clean experience. All of us slept so well and thought the beds were comfy. The backyard is inviting and nicely done.
The living room chairs and couch are very nice. They have a beautiful leather couch that I was careful and covered with blankets to be safe. The girls actually preferred to hang out in the bunk room mostly as it had larger Full size beds top and bottom.
Check in was super intuitive with the code they provided and keyless. Nick was always very responsive, super understanding, and quick to reply. We had a few issues with our van rental breaking down, and hiccups with our trip. He was a gracious host. When Plan B happened it was nice to have a refreshing, cool place to enjoy and refuel our energy at. Lake Havasu is always a good time."

Group trip","The house was absolutely beautiful. However, I will never stay here again. The host requested $100.00 for a little mark on a sheet and pillow which can easily be removed with a simple wash. Furthermore, the host said I left the house messy which is simply not true as I left the house spotless. I even swept and mopped. I asked for him to show me proof and photos of whatever was “messy” which he failed to do so. Appears this host just wants to make a quick buck by falsely claiming damages. Sadly, I simply do not understand the excessive cleaning fees if it doesn’t pertain to the most simplest cleaning."

Nicholas was a great host! He was extremely fast with responding and went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible!!"

Stayed one night","This place is our last and the 8th Airbnb stay during our Route 66 trip. We had some bad experience from the previous night, so we crossed figure and wish this last Airbnb can be a good one. It happens to be one of the guests’ birthday and we hoped that there is enough cooking stuffs and big dinning table so that we could cook and celebrate the friend’s birthday in the house. When we arrived, we were so happy and it has everything we need. We were able to cook very delicious food and celebrate together. Rooms are all spacious, each room has the full mirrors for ladies. Beds are very comfortable. The whole house is very clean, stylish. There is outside patio and chairs for us to relax and enjoy the outside comfort at night. The house is located at nice area also. We feel regret that we don’t have time to stay here longer to enjoy the beautiful Lake Havasu. We all agree this is the best of the 8 airbnb places that we stayed to go through Route 66."

The livingroom is spacious and cozy for family tv or the large games of jinga or connect 4. The back yard is quiet and a nice place to sit and read or chat. We didn't use the grill or fire pits which were there and I am sure adds to the backyard fun. The beds were all clean and very comfortable. The bedrooms were quiet even when others were still up. The bathrooms are spacious and allow plenty of space to get ready in. The neighborhood was quiet and the neighbors didn't seem to think twice about us being there. The house isnt far from the London Bridge. The hospital is minutes away should you need it. Stores and restaurants are also very close. The house is easy to find.

That is unheard of in the Airbnb world. Wow! The place is a GEM! Everything you will need is there. We love it. It's beautiful and comfortable. It's in a very safe neighborhood and close to everywhere. And you can't beat the price! We hope to come back in the near future. We enjoyed our stay very much.

We especially appreciated that there was a pack and play and high chair available for our youngest daughter. Vincent was a great host and we will certainly try to rent this house again when we're back in Lake Havasu! Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","Great find. Vincent was very easy to communicate with and made our stay feel like home. I visited for my daughters birthday and my family fell in love with his home. It’s in a great location, very spacious and extremely peaceful. You have literally everything you need at your finger tips. Vincent was such a great host that he also took the time to have his cleaning crew locate items we accidentally left at his home when checking out and returned them back to us out of state. If you are looking for a great place to kick back and relax you’ve come to the right spot. I will definitely be returning next year. This home is a gem!"

Vincent was super accommodating allowing us to check in as early as we needed. Vincent even offered a late check out to help out even though it was not needed. I am super appreciative of Vincent. Quick communication and a beautiful home made this trip super easy on my family.
