Stayed a few nights","My Wife’s parents live near Tupelo so we wanted to stay somewhere close to visit them plus have a quiet vacation.
We had a very enjoyable time. The Apiary home and property are beautiful and secluded…yet within 10-15 mins of everything. My wife and I enjoyed interacting with the animals, having morning coffee on the front porch with the friendly roosters and relaxing out at the pond.
The crowing rooster and symphonic buzz of the Cicadas added to the calm, peaceful setting.
Justin is a great host, I highly recommend staying here. Thank you for having us and we’d definitely come back."

Stayed one night","Justin's house is simply stunning! Our blues band pulled in late after a show in Memphis and he left the lights on and made it easy to get in. In the morning after a great night's sleep, we walked outside to find a beautiful pond, donkeys to pet, and gorgeous scenery to enjoy our coffee. Inside, the house was clean and so comfortable! There is no doubt that we'll stay here again should our travels take us through Tupelo!"

Group trip","We loved our short stay at The Apiary. Our group had so much fun loving on and feeding the animals, sitting by a fire near the lake, swinging on the porch swing, and playing the piano and the games that were provided. The home was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The upper level was a perfect space for our group of teens. Justin and Laura Beth were excellent hosts and responded quickly when we had a question. It was an overall great experience and we definitely hope to come back!"

Stayed with kids","Justin’s farmhouse is a great getaway place for privacy, outdoor activities and fun for the kids. Kids had a great fun at the pond and with interacting with the farm animals sheep donkey, chicken/roosters. Our almost 4 year old child ￼loved the playground area and man-made swing. Justin was great. He answered all the questions immediately. When we forgot something valuable, he made sure to find it right away to get back to us :)"

Group trip","This farm house is very adorable. I needed a private, relaxing location to serve as a home away from home while we dealt with a death in the family. It was perfect. The property is secluded from the surrounding area and other homes, so once you arrive you feel as if you have escaped to a private get away. The animals are a lovely distraction. A walk around the pond is a good daily exercise. The fire pit was nice a warm during this late January stay. My only reservation is the bathroom situation: There is only one bedroom with an attached bath. The other bath is very small and a stand alone to be shared with the rest of the house. So, just make sure that works for your group. Lastly, my Dad wants to go back and try fishing in the pond, as he didn't bring a pole this trip. He loved it. Thanks Justin!"

Stayed with kids","Justin and Laura were excellent hosts. We bought a fire starter and fire log for the fire pit by the lake, as well as a wonderful bottle of wine that we’re waiting for us upon check in. They were very responsive and were helpful with anything we needed. The house was pristine, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook dinner. Our favorite thing we’re the animals! There was food available to feed the roosters, chickens, donkeys, goats, and sheep. You don’t need an alarm set on your phone, because the sweet roosters will let you know when it’s time to wake up by hanging around the front door or windows and singing us a good morning song - we thought it was hilarious! It was close to town, but still isolated and private to enjoy time together. We will definitely be back!"

Group trip","This was a great place to meet with family. We enjoyed visiting with the animals and cooking together in the big open living area. The dining table is perfect for a big dinner or playing board games.
The only issue is that the check in is on the later side, check out is on the earlier side, and the chore list is on the longer side.
We’d stay with a big group again!"

The farm animals were all friendly, and you can’t hear them from inside of the house which was a plus for our group. 10ish minutes from Downtown Tupelo makes it a great location.
We will stay here again in the future!"

Stayed with kids","We have an annual family reunion/vacation, and this year we were excited to stay at the farm which was perfect for our family of ten. The house is not only beautiful but spacious inside and out. It was perfect for what we were looking for and our exterior surroundings were peaceful and lovely with a variety of outdoor spaces to enjoy. We loved coming together in the open living/kitchen/dining areas for breakfasts, dinners, board games and/or to watch movies together. Everyone, especially the kiddos enjoyed the animals, playing outside, and fishing was a huge hit for all. Shopping/Dining/Downtown was just a short driving distance away. We enjoyed the fresh eggs and we also picked fresh berries. Blueberries for pancakes and a blueberry/blackberry pastry. Our host was very friendly, helpful and quick to respond if needed. Thank you Justin, for allowing us to create special memories together. It was truly a wonderful experience my family will never forget."

Group trip",The place was great and very clean. Location was close enough to town to get to everything we need yet far enough away to not be bothered. Justin came out to feed the animals and he was very friendly. My only complaint is that there are not televisions in the bedroom and the beds are full size. We were several couple and a queen size bed would have been easier to sleep. Justin was very accommodating with check in/out and the entire house was very clean. The animals are a joy to see. We loved drinking coffee and having the chickens come up to us each morning. Would 100% recommend this place to friends and family.

Lots of places for people to gather and chill. Only thing I would change would be to switch the double bed for a queen, but we knew that when we booked it. We would love to stay again!"

I would seek out his airbnb should it be available. Our family just felt free and at home."

The kid’s playground in the back and the adorable baby animals made it even better! The host was quick to respond and helped in more ways than 1. Be sure to bring quarters to purchase animal feed and it gives a petting zoo feel.
The perfect farmhouse! Would absolutely return if given the opportunity."

Stayed with kids","This was one of the nicest AirBNB’s we have ever stayed in! It was so spacious for our family of seven. The property was so beautiful. Our grand kids had an absolute ball playing on the playground, trampoline, saucer swing, and rope swing. They were so excited to get to feed the chickens, and goats, and to pet the sheep and donkey! When it rained, they enjoyed playing with all the games and toys in the huge upstairs bedroom/ playroom. The giant chalk board wall was their favorite activity!
We were in Tupelo for a family funeral and it was just wonderful to have a place so spacious that we could invite relatives to come out and re-connect with each other.
The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare an impromptu family meal for ourselves and extended family.
Justin was a wonderful host who was always available for anything we needed. I highly recommend The Apiary Farm to anyone who wants a uniquely perfect place to stay !"

Stayed a few nights","The Apiary is truly something special and for the price, you just can’t beat it. The home is well appointed, extremely comfortable and the farm animals in the front yard make this a must AIRbnb. Justin was very responsive to all of my communications. It was just my wife and I, but this place essentially has four separate bedrooms and can accommodate a large family. We we there for only two nights and the weather horrible with constant rain. We wished we could have enjoyed the outdoor amenities, like morning coffee on the front porch to enjoy the view of the animals. If you are visiting Tupelo, MS, look no further than The Apiary for a memorable stay."

We were just passing through for 1 night and we were so bummed we didn't have more time! We were going to extend our day and even add another night but severe weather was coming through and we didn't want to risk it. Justin was so kind and understanding and was quick to communicate during that stressful morning of us trying to figure out what to do about the storms rolling in. I appreciated his kindness and flexibility so much.
Every piece of furniture in the entire house was beyond comfortable! Once I sat down somwhere or laid in the bed I didn't want to move. They have curated and amazing space and it was classy, comfortable, and cozy all at the same time.
Bring quarters to feed the sheep, donkey, goats, and chickens!
I can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to return for a longer visit!!"

Greeted with a handwritten card, fresh chicken eggs and local coffee, this place was just what we needed to escape to. There are plenty of board games, a playground area, karaoke machine, corn hole, fire pit and other wonderful surprises to keep the kiddos busy.

Though the area surrounding the area is a mix of commercial and industrial, the street on which the house is located is quaint and welcoming. The house is clean and as described in the listing. As noted, it is within walking distance of downtown, with restaurants, coffee shops, bakery etc. The location is convenient to everything! Ample off-street parking was a plus! We liked the open floor plan with kitchen, dining area and living room all together in one space. The beds were comfortable and we slept well at the end of our days exploring the area."

Stayed one night",We loved our stay in Tupelo. The house is situated on the edge of a small cliff above a bayou running past an old mill. The cicadas sing from the small forest in the backyard. All the homes on the quiet street have large front porches. We enjoyed a massive thunder and lightning storm from our porch. The house was gorgeous inside with a wonderful deck beyond the master. There could not be more southern charm here! Thank you for an amazing first visit to Mississippi!

Stayed a few nights","My 3 bicycling buddies and I were on our annual bike adventure when we stayed in Tupelo. Rebecca's place, in the old district was perfect for our 2 day stay. Oodles of room for 4 unrelated grumpy males, great water pressure and even a deep bathtub, perfect for a soak after 45 miles of biking, The beds were very comfortable, and I appreciated the very plush towels. One of my buddies commented on how friendly all the folks in this peaceful neighborhood were. Rebecca clearly has great attention to detail; we wanted for nothing. While it is doubtful I'll pass through Tupelo again, if I do I'll try to stay here for sure!"

She let us check in early after an issue arose and let us come back after check out time to retrieve our things since we were there for tennis matches. The house was outstanding. She had coffee, chips, snacks for us to enjoy and I can’t say enough about the house. The beds were outstanding. This house has a master somewhat separated and we loved that!! Everything couldn’t have been more perfect!!! Thank you and we WILL be back!"

I reached out to Rebecca because we were checking out a day early and I needed to know what I need to do before leaving. She told me to just leave because I had enough to deal with. Our one night was awesome and I'm very grateful for her getting back to me within a matter of minutes even though she had 24 hours to do so. Definitely would stay there again.

Stayed with kids","Rebecca’s home was truly amazing. Such a unique and special home with so much character and lots of love — a true southern gem of a home! A very welcoming, spacious and comfortable place to rest while we were traveling. She was very responsive and kind to us. We were traveling with a 4 and 1 year old and the house had plenty of room for them to stretch their legs for the night. I couldn’t recommend this stay enough if traveling through Tupelo! The master bathroom alone is something to note… promise! :) We even got to catch a cool lightning storm while sitting on the front porch. It was a great experience all around. Thank you endlessly, Rebecca!"

Some have mentioned the noise of the train. I can say we didn’t hear it one time at night. Rebecca provided us with sound machines as she knew we had three kids under 6. THIS IS THE PLACE TO STAY IN TUPELO!

Everything was very clean. We have stayed in a different Airbnb in this neighborhood before so we knew about the train being in close proximity, but we slept through it because we were so worn out from Fourth of July weekend festivities. If you have kids in your group, definitely check out the fountain at Fair Park and the playground there. Walmart neighborhood market is very close by for groceries.
Rebecca was kind enough to contact me about an item we left behind and she’s mailing it to me!"

Nice that you can check in by 2 pm. another huge plus for my son and myself was the park is literally across the street, and we played a lot of catch with the football. the place is on a busy road with a stop light, so there is a lot of traffic that you hear, but you are close to everything. just minutes from Downtown. we had a great time, and we love Tupelo and its history. I hope someday we finally get to move there. As for the house, it is 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a really cool split shower with a slider door and laundry on the otherside it's pretty cool and clever. The kitchen was very good as well. We had a wonderful time, and Ken and Helen were wonderful hosts and lived just a few houses down. we can't wait to come back to Tupelo next year!"

Stayed with a pet","Out of all my stays at a property, I gave this review much thought. Thank you John for offering this place most of all, but these words are for future guests.
If you are travelling with a pet, or you require 1st floor access, this place is a perfect. Otherwise there are many other options that will probably meet your needs at a more reasonable price.
Improvements here must include better bedding and pillows, plus cleaning of the towels so that they are not sour. My wife's allergies flared up and left as early as possible the next day, as we could not identify the source.
Think of this stay as more of a motel and you will not be disappointed."

We enjoyed our short stay and would stay here again. The only thing that I think should be mentioned is that there is a police training facility very near by and by 8am you could hear their target practice and tons of cop cars speeding out of the road near the house. It didn't bother me too much but some people may get nervous or scared hearing gunshots constantly."

It's a little off the beaten path, and there's a shooting range nearby that had activity in the early morning, but that didn't bother me and I'd absolutely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This was my first Airbnb stay and I wasn't sure what to expect. The place was great. Far better than any motel or hotel I have ever stayed in. The house was clean, in a quiet safe neighborhood and a peaceful setting. In town but out of the rat race. The house is within 10 minutes or less of good places to eat. Lori is a great host. I will try to stay with Lori the next time I am in town. The house has a nice deck with chairs and a table. You won't go wrong staying at this place. The house came with coffee and the feeling of home. Lori is a great host. What more could I ask for? Nothing as it was a great stay!"

We didn't really use the kitchen much, bit it looked well stocked, beds and furniture were comfy. we also were able to do a drive by of Elvis' home since it was only about 2.5 miles away. Lori was communicative and pleasant. She offered local suggestions. We would definitely stay here again if we're came back to the area."

Stayed a few nights","I was delighted with this cute little house, which perfectly fit my needs when I was in Tupelo visiting friends and also working remotely. The house is clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable. Lori responded promptly to a few questions that I had.
The house is in a primarily residential area, but it should be noted that it's near a law enforcement training center and sometimes during the daytime hours I could hear shots from the police shooting range. The house is far enough away so that it wasn't loud and it didn't bother me, and I note it only for those people who might be sensitive to that kind of noise.
I definitely plan to stay at The Tupelo Honey House again the next time I visit Tupelo."

Stayed one night","Very great responsive host. She left us honey! Yummy! And chocolate! Very cozy place. I came here from Alabama for a place to stay traveling. It is very close to Elvis’s birthplace which is cool. However, I give the location rating a four as it was right in front of a police training range and we kept hearing gun fire. Place had tide pods for us to use. Thank you! 🙏 overall I really really really enjoyed the stay but some nitpicks: no oven mits to take hot pan out of oven, place doesn’t really have three beds. It has one bed in the master bedroom, then a couch like bed in the other room. And other the couch type bed, it had roll away mattress that sat low to the ground. It has three mattresses, not beds. Also the deck is dry rotted in one place and my friend fell through it, which is a safety concern. Please get that fixed. Also no towel rack in bathroom. But very little nitpicks I loved staying here!"

We stayed on the way to our Thanksgiving trip and on the way back as it is a half way point for our family. In between stays, Lori had the Christmas decorations put up. It was so joyful to arrive and the kids see the little Christmas tree in the house. Tupelo Honey is so cozy, the linens and beds are comfy, and the decor is chic and timeless! We will continue to return because we always feel we get even more than what we pay for. Love that there are always coffee pods and creamer ready for us, bottled water in the fridge and a little Tupelo happy from Lori's family. I save all the little cards from her! Stay in this home if you are passing through or make a point to come check out this adorable home and this precious Southern town.

Our pets were also welcome, with two dog bowls awaiting. The back porch, patio, and private back yard was an oasis for the pets and us. Moreover, on our second night we experienced a power outage and Lori was quick to respond. She offered us many options and kept us informed of the situation.

Her counter featured a candy jar filled with pink starbursts. The “honey house” is filled with all kinds of pink starbursts: the small jar of honey left on the counter, the quality soap in the bathroom, the thoughtful decor touches…. The attention to detail in the house and host’s friendly communication at this AirBnB epitomize southern hospitality. This was one of the best experiences we’ve had on this app."

Washer and dryer come in handy if needed. Responsive host if you run into any issues. One and only downside is the police training academy down the hill. If they are training cadets then you will hear the gun fire until dark which dis scare our pup for 20 minutes then she got use to it and fell asleep. That was the only con. The deck was great for sitting and having dinner or coffee. We would definitely stay again if back in the area.

Bedrooms were comfortable and had plenty of room. The outside area was phenomenal. Location was also perfect since everything you could need was less than a 15 minute drive away. Host was very responsive and flexible. On our next trip up to Tupelo we will definitely be trying to book this place again.

Good place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","Overall the house was ok. The queen bed had a broken box spring, so it was very uncomfortable. The pillows were awful. The bed sheets were wrinkled and had hair on them. The dining room table was falling apart. There were stains on the walls. There were dried splotches of who knows what on the floors. The caulking in the bathrooms had large cracks and mold. The lock on the door was automatic and would not stay unlocked. If you had not learned the 8 character code you would get locked outside. Don’t waste your money. If you can’t find an Airbnb stay in a hotel."

Arrived with no hiccups! The house has plenty of space, awesome back patio area. The bedrooms were perfect, bathrooms spotless, the temperature stayed consistent throughout the house which was a BIG plus in cold weather. Very peaceful, quiet, neighborhood. In the morning, go out back and soak in the fantastic trees and view. This home made this virgin Air BnB user sold on this experience!
Will definitely recommend to friends and family! If in Tupelo, MS this is the place to stay."

Our big kids loved playing in the backyard and racing their bikes up and down the driveway - the carport was PERFECT for that!

When I walked in there was beautiful music playing, the home smelled amazing and very clean! We are so grateful for this memory made."

From the moment we arrived, after a stressful week of dealing with the expiration of my best dog of 17 years, though he didnt know he was a ‘dog’, we were already booked for a wedding weekend, and missing it was not an option. This amazing, comfortable, clean and classy abode, was the exact spot we needed to relax, reflect and celebrate in a style I didn’t expect. Hands down, the best spot she and I have stayed."

Beautiful french antiques mixed-in with some fun, creative flair. Everything was finished-out beautifully, especially the bathroom. Great attention to details and loved all of the modern amenities like the LED mirrors and shower with all of the different sprayers. Chris was also very responsive and communicative. We went out to dinner but the kitchen was awesome. Wish we could have used. Great for staying in and cooking. He allowed me bring my two small dogs which I appreciated. There was a pet-fee but I thought that was reasonable, as dogs can be hard on homes! The bed needs a new mattress though. I have a bad neck and am particularly sensitive to this. Otherwise it was a lovely stay and would absolutely recommend to even the most persnickety of folks! As long as mattress get’s replaced!"

Every amenity you would expect and then so many more that you never would have expected. The outdoor space was as delightful as the indoors. Great seating spaces with a light breeze making the Mississippi heat enjoyable.

This place was nothing short of remarkable. Offers an unparalleled blend of sophistication and coziness, instantly creating a sense of 'home away from home'.
The property charmed us right from the start, with its thoughtful design standing out. The host has invested considerable effort into crafting a space that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also
functional. It was spotless throughout, with meticulous attention to detail visible in every corner.
Every need has been anticipated. From plush bedding to well-equipped kitchen facilities, ""Rare"" was a haven of comfort. Every amenity felt like it was handpicked, providing an elevated stay. This is one of the best places we have stayed. It is a place where charm, cleanliness, and comfort blend to offer an outstanding accommodation experience. We look forward to revisiting Tupelo, knowing we have a perfect home waiting for us there!!"

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb is aptly named: RARE. Rarely have I been in a place I felt so instantly at home. I noticed two things simultaneously when I opened the door for the first time: the beautifully framed art work on the wall to my right and the incredible smell of the room.
The rest of the space was equally lovely. The pictures can’t tell the whole story; it has to be seen. The bed linens were soft and the bed comfy; Ample coffee in the well-stocked kitchen; The adorable pink toaster! As another reviewer mentioned, the bathroom alone is it’s own experience, complete with provided bubble bath and bath salts.
But perhaps the highest praise I can offer is this: I walked barefoot the entirety of my stay. I don’t do that anywhere that is not my own home; I’m just weird about cleanliness that way. This home is not just clean, “it’s MONICA clean!”
Thank you for such a perfectly RARE experience.!"

It was that comfortable! It was worth the money in every single way! It’s all the LUX for me! We did manage to make it to the Blue Canoe bc it’s ALWAYS on the list when we’re in town! Bathroom is top tier! Slept like a baby, everything there we needed, check in/out is a breeze, location is perfect, it’s just ALL THE THINGS! And I’m kind of like a Airbnb snob so there’s that! Our thing we do together is take random trips all over and pick a cool place to stay so it’s always a competition to nail a good stay! So thanks Chris for the win! We would definitely stay again!"

While close to the downtown area and other restaurants, shops, etc., it’s also located in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. The closed in patio and backyard was perfect for the kids to run around and play in, and also allowed for a wonderful place to spend family time together. Anthony was also extremely helpful and flexible on check in given we had an unpredictable schedule from a long road trip. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here the next time we visit."

He let us check in early , he was so responsive if we needed him. We are so thankful to have picked him as our host. The house itself was PERFECT in every way. Spacious , extremely clean , decorated nicely very current in their style. Everything seemed fresh and new! The outside was a nice surprise. The size of the screened porch and the separate outdoor patio with a nice island bar to sit at. This house is perfect for all families and groups.

My Guests who visited fell in love with the place. One actually said if they could build that’s the layout they would want. The house is a nice size without being too much. Uber and Door Dash found me with ease and Rhonda and her husband were the most responsive, helpful hosts. It was my first time in Tupelo and we plan to go back for another sorority function.

Stayed with a pet","I Like the name Sugar Shack but this place was no shack at all😊😍 I would have called it the little Oasis. It was such a beautiful place in a deserted/ unattractive looking neighborhood. Very safe but unattractive. Everything else you could need in a home was at your fingertips in the Sugar Shack. Very very clean and well kept. Beds comfortable and slept well. 🤔 Did I say BEAUTIFUL❓the decor is the 💣 .com😍it’s close to the downtown area and anything you would need is fairly close to the location. There’s a nice little park across the street from the house and the locals ❤️ their pickle ball. The only negative thing about that is there’s no good parking so they’ll block the driveway, which makes it hard for you to come and go. A sign saying don’t block drive would definitely help. I hope the next guest treats the Sugar Shack as good as my family did because we will be coming back Ms. Rhonda"

Group trip","Sugar Shack is such a quaint and eccentrically decorated house. We loved exploring everything. Every corner had special touches. The beds were very comfortable, everything was super clean, and the hot tub was an added bonus. We stayed for a weekend getaway for my 14 year old daughter's birthday. They surprised her with a birthday balloon and Crumbl cookie upon check in. We will be staying here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Check-in was easy and the host was very responsive with questions. House was very clean and everything was perfect. Pickle ball courts across the street are a plus if that's your thing. Layout of the house was good. Kitchen was well stocked with any cooking utensil you could need, better stocked than other kitchens at places I've stayed in the past. We had a great stay and would stay here again."

Stayed one night",This is a hidden gem. Would highly recommend it. The house is decorated so cute. Loved it all. Everything was so clean. Owner left us a note with a loaf of homemade bread that was to die for. Enjoyed the hot tub. Will definitely be back. Don’t hesitate if you are looking for a place to stay. It’s very spacious.

Stayed a few nights","The house looks like brand new rehab. Everything was sparkling clean. Kitchen was more than adequately stocked and first time I’ve had an air fryer. It came in quite handy. Pickleball court directly across. They take the courts down after so not open to public, but players were very nice. Only slight complaint might be a little too much “decor,” but it was fun and homey. Loved the homemade bread and snacks!! Really wonderful place. Location was close to downtown. I’d definitely stay again."

Stayed with kids","Very nice place, very clean, beds were very comfortable, hot tub was great and they even left a loaf of what seemed to be homemade bread! We also loved the record player! We had to get in late and leave at a odd hour because we were there for our sons swim meet and Rhonda was very accommodating! close to downtown and if you are into pickle ball there’s brand new courts across the street! Highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Great place!!! Very clean, beds were very comfortable, new appliances, and the hot tub was awesome. All the amenities of home. Close to everything downtown and Great restaurants! The owners were very accommodating. We had to check in and out at odd hours because we were in town for my sons state swim meet. There’s pickle ball courts across the street if you like that and we loved the record player. 10 out of 10 would recommend!!!!!
P.s. we loved the homemade loaf of bread that was left for us."
