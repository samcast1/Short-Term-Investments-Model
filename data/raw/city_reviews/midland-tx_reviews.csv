Stayed a few nights","We have a 1 year old and we had Thanksgiving with my family. This place was absolutely lovely and a great getaway from too much family time. My daughter was able to stay on her schedule away from home. This place gave us a little cozy home to come to and my husband and I could watch TV or play a video game while our slept peacefully in the room. Terri’s place literally at everything. We forgot our Pack and Play at home and she had one. Totally saved us from having to buy another one. Terri and I kept up great communication. She was very responsive to messages. We asked if we could check out an hour later since we all slept in and Terri had no problem with this request. Next time we visit family in Midland, I hope this place is available. Thank you so much Terri, truly."

It was difficult for me to sleep while breathing those chemicals in all night."

Stayed a few nights","The condo was exactly like the photos, absolutely spotless, and spacious for a 1 bed/1 bath. Very well decorated and supplied. I really appreciated the thoughtfulness of details like extra power plugs at the bedside table, toiletries in the shower, and a well stocked kitchen. I had a small issue with the check-in code, but the host responded immediately and got everything resolved. I also appreciated the grocery shopping recommendations and having stores within walking distance. Parking is covered but may be a tight squeeze for oversized vehicles. You can hear sound from the parking lot/street at night so if you are a light sleeper I suggest packing earplugs/your preferred sleep aid. Overall I highly recommend this Airbnb for a solo traveler or couple. The quality, convenience, and host responsiveness earn 5 stars!"

Stayed one night","We had a fantastic stay at this lovely cottage! From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed by a fresh and pleasant smell, which made us feel right at home. The cottage was really spacious and super clean, with everything we could possibly need.
Our favorite part was definitely the shower. It was huge and felt really luxurious, making our getting ready time extra special. We also appreciated how safe we felt during our stay. The neighborhood is quiet, and having a driveway to park on was a big plus.
Overall, we absolutely loved our time here and can't wait to come back. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing and comfortable getaway!"

We did not want to get a hotel but were worried about accommodations and this exceeded our expectations!! If we return to Midland we will definitely be returning to this beautiful home! Clean and feels just like home! My infant was so comfortable and slept great! Thank you!!"

Other's reviews are important to me. The reviews were spot on. Have recommended to siblings visiting the area. It felt like we were in our own home. Our dog didn't cry when placed in her crate as she too felt at home. Jenifer is phenomenal. Thanks again!!

Stayed one night","There are lots of positives to this property, and then there are a handful of downfalls. I stay in AirB&B’s quite often, and have had a mixed bag of experiences.
The pros:
-Scott, the host, is awesome. He is very responsive, helpful, and kind.
-the bedroom itself is great. Comfy bed, nice furniture, good space, comfy linens.
-Kitchen and bathroom have been somewhat renovated and updated. Some parts of both were really nice.
The cons:
-the property itself is separate, but not the most private. It is connected to an upstairs unit. While it is locked off and not accessible from inside the unit, the two units share a backyard entry. This isn’t a big deal, except there are no curtains on the large windows and sliding glass door in the unit… therefore anyone that is climbing the stairs outside can see into the downstairs unit.
-because of the unit upstairs, you can hear noise and footsteps quite often.
-the kitchen is terribly stocked if you’re looking to cook. Old pots and pans!!"

Stayed one night","The main thing stopping me from giving five stars is the shared staircase. I understand it is not meant to be used, but when you described the place as “no shared space” I was expecting everything to be completely closed off with no way for other guests to enter either portion of the house. As soon as my husband and I walked through the front door we noticed the staircase and could hear the other guests conversations from upstairs. We ended up sleeping with the bedroom door locked because of the possibility anyone could walk downstairs any minute."

Stayed a few nights","Just phenomenal..
I travel from DFW to the Midland/Odessa area on a regular basis for work, and after losing my patience with the decline in service at overpriced hotels, I finally wised up and started using Airbnb for business trips, instead of just personal trips. And this was my first time doing so. And it did not disappoint!! I have zero regret, other than I didn’t start sooner!
This place was amazing, to say the very least. The workspace in the bedroom is absolutely perfect. The desk looks classic and is made from beautiful, real wood.. but has all the new technology hidden inside of it! It raises and lowers automatically to allow for standing or sitting, which allowed me to continue working without having to take standing breaks, due to my lower back pain. And to top it off, the view from the desk through the gorgeous, wide open windows into the back yard, full of REAL grass and shaded by big oak trees, was a breath of fresh air. The squirrels running around added some entertainment. Reminded me of home.
The bedroom itself was very spacious and comfortable. Nice cozy bed and bedding, with very nice bedside tables. And me being used to having a large tv in the bedroom at home, it was nice to have that there as well. And the bathroom was perfect. Loved the shower, loved the design, the closet, literally everything.
I really enjoyed the big open concept in the living and dining room, with the large windows letting in all the light and providing the nice view of the backyard. All the furniture, decor, and nice big TV was much better than I had expected! Very comfortable and welcoming environment. Hope to put the fireplace to use next time!
And the kitchen was incredible. Very updated with all stainless appliances, and everything you need to cook a meal if you choose to do so. Including a very nice gas range.
And last, but definitely not least, the backyard…. The backyard is not shared, so you have the entire covered back patio area, as well as the whole yard, all to yourself. And it is the perfect spot to kick back and have coffee in the mornings and get the wheels turning, and also an adult beverage in the evenings to wind down. The neighborhood is quiet, and the only things running wild are the squirrels. And they are fun to watch. They stay busy collecting acorns until nighttime every day, lol.
I highly recommend Runway 25. It’s the perfect home away from home, and made my business trip a much more pleasant trip than I could ever ask for. Scott is the most responsive, communicative, and friendly host I’ve ever had the pleasure of dealing with. 5 stars all around!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Spacious home (and this is just the ground floor of the house) in a quiet residential neighborhood. Kitchen, dining room, living room, and bedroom were all of a good size and comfortable.
The location was fine for us for one night, though I don't know Midland well enough to compare. The single best feature for us was probably the fenced back yard —our dog was so happy to get out of the car that he ran around and around in circles and slept peacefully. There is a very attractive park just a block away, another good feature whether you are traveling with a dog or not."

Quality bed and linens, convenient location, and a snack basket for an extra touch. There were a few issues we had (fridge trips off when outside lights were on, toilet tank would not fill after flushing, mouse dropping in one kitchen drawer under stove) but Scott was immediately very responsive. This is a two story home; we rented the bottom floor. There was a gate at the bottom blocking the staircase going up."

The property itself is also very thoughtfully and well designed, with enough items and appliances to make the space suitable for a long term rental. You can really feel the pride from the owner in this property, which adds a warm feeling to the entire space. We loved having access to a back yard, a real sitting/standing desk (awesome for us digital nomads!), plenty of light, and a nice big kitchen. The dining table and super comfy couch (and delicious king bed) were cherrys on the cake!
Scott is also a fabulous host who was incredible responsive.

He put them on his front porch for my sister to go pick up. He tried to contact us before we left Midland that we had left them, but I didn't see it until we got back to north Texas.

Stayed a few nights","The house was in a nice neighborhood and quiet. The house was clean and plenty of beds and space for everyone to stretch out in. The only things we did not like was there were security cameras everywhere, in the bedrooms (except master), in living room, kitchen, all down the front of the house and the backyard. We did not feel like we had privacy. The backyard was not very welcoming as there was a vehicle parked in the bad and some debris next to it as well so we did not feel comfortable letting our children play in the backyard and could not bbq for that reason as well, so we had to spend the weekend inside. Other than that the house was good."

Unfortunately the house is little off the beaten path, the first day we found out the walls are a little thin and you can hear your neighbors quite a bit. We complained to the host about unruly neighbors and they rectified the situation very quickly. The walls weren’t paper thin so much just super loud neighbors. Overall the place is beautiful and the host are super amazing and responsive. Worth the money definitely"

Coffee and snacks were even provided. The rooms were all spacious and welcoming. The location was perfect for us to be near our kids and grandchildren. The house is on the corner of a busy thoroughfare but was not loud, and shops and restaurants were nearby. It was an extremely safe area. The house lock was genius, much easier than others we’ve used. There was a beautiful backyard space divided into a seating area and a yard for play. We had a son, DIL and three grandchildren in the house with me and my husband and there was room for us all to be comfortable. We will be back even if it’s just the two of us! Thank you for the perfect Easter stay!"

Stayed over a week","I will for sure use Thomas's place again. My husband had to have emergency heart surgery while working in Midland, Tx. So, we really needed a place like Thomas's to stay at. It was very clean, easy to fine, very peaceful neighborhood, beds were so comfortable, and had everything we needed to stay there. My husband recovered well. Few shops and restaurants just minutes away which was nice. Thomas was very helpful when I needed something. 10/10 host!!

We had a little trouble finding the place initially because we didn’t know it was a duplex and the unit number was not provided in the address. Once we found the unit it was easy to get in. Thomas was responsive.

The house had amazing canvas photos which Thomas captured on his travels, really cool artwork and authentic decor. My husband and I travel for work with our 2 children, my service dog and 1 pet dog and this place was absolutely cozy for our little family! The backyard was perfect for my kids to get some sun and the doggies to stretch. The doggie door on the back door was a huge plus! Thomas was very communicative throughout our stay and since we had such an awesome experience here this house has been added to our favorites and we will definitely be returning soon!"

Thomas provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash and the washer and dryer were a plus! He even provided tide pods. The backyard is cute and clean, it has a doggy door to go outside and it is safe and secured. I couldn’t find how to get into the garage but it’s there and is an option. The shower was amazing! Great pressure, it was very relaxing. One has a nice tub and one is a walk in shower. Plenty of towels. Overall great stay, thank you Thomas for letting us rest at your home."

Highly recommend this to anyone visiting Midland, Texas looking for a comfortable stay. Everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Thomas was the most thoughtful, gracious host. Our travel from Mississippi to Texas was eleven hours. When we arrived in Texas it was too early to check in, however, Thomas was very understanding and allowed us to do an early check in.
He provided us with all the information we needed. The house was a home away from home. The Kitchen was perfect and contains everything one needs. The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace are excellent. Thomas home was also pet friendly. Perfect for our small Poodle. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and I will definitely return."

Stayed with kids",Esther’s place was perfect for 2 families to stay while in town for thanksgiving. We had lots of room to spread out. The toys at the place were a huge hit for our 4 kiddos too. The place was very clean and convenient to come and go from for the 4 days we were there! It was too chilly for us to enjoy the patio but I bet it’s amazing when the weather is nice. Would recommend to anyone in the area and will stay at again when we’re in the area!

Very easy checkin and out with Esther readily available for any questions. Was so much nicer having our three families together in a comfortable home with toys for the kids, etc., rather than three hotel rooms, which probably would have cost about the same."

For example, I wish I could take the ""blue room"" home with me. All the rooms are spacious and comfortable. However, some of the cushions in the living room have seen better days. I need to shout out the accessibility of the place. My wife has MS, and she had no problem getting in and around the home. We appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and wonderful dining room for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was memorable. The only issue was the dishwasher would not drain. Still, this place was one of the best places I have ever rented. It was good food, good times, and a great place!"

This house is extremely clean, fun decor, in a safe location , with thoughtful amenities, comfortable beds, and good water pressure and hot showers.

The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is the perfect size to prepare a meal or bake some cookies. My favorite is that Ali keeps essential things to cook in the pantry. Things like spices, oil, sugar and flour and more, that I many times I forget at home. There is plenty of towels for us and the kitchen as well. Laundry detergent and other cleaners are something I’m always grateful too. So we really feel at home!"

Stayed with kids","Derek's place was a great stay with our kids and dogs. The house was clean, secure, and we had plenty of room for our family of four. The location was great! With it being just a bit off of Loop 250, there was ease of access to shopping, groceries and restaurants. We could get to anything we needed within a few a minutes. The pros of the house are: the AC works great, comfortable beds, plenty of paper towels and GOOD toilet paper, cleanliness in every room, new carpet in 2nd and 3rd bedrooms, large closets, comfortable couches, great dining table, updated throughout, new appliances in the kitchen....you can tell the hosts have put some love into the house. The cons are very few: there were only two wash cloths in the house (plenty of bath towels though) and the backyard could use some TLC to match the inside. Overall, we loved the place and would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is perfect! It was exactly as advertised. Clean and super comfortable. We love to cook and found everything we needed and more in this kitchen. And the pantry is large enough to accommodate all the groceries we needed for a week.
The bathrooms are stocked with more towels that you can use in a few days.
Derek and Ali were very friendly and helpful. They were prompt to answer any questions and went out of their way to bring anything extra (like paper goods) plus snacks!
My family was very comfortable. This place is close to lots of restaurants and fun places for the whole family to enjoy even when on a business trip. We felt at home. This is the best fit for our family that we have found in our many trips to midland. I hope they will be available when we return."

Stayed with a pet","This was a great place for us to stay - over 2 months as temporary housing as we were moving to Midland. The house was just right for our family of 4. The office & garage were spacious and nice adds. It was also helpful that Derek’s house allowed us to bring our cats with us. With so many issues to deal with in a move, it was a tremendous benefit to have a nice comfortable house to come home to. The location is good too - walking distance to Wal Mart, Chik Fil A, etc. Highly recommended!"

Stayed with a pet","Derek's place is nicely appointed and in a nice quiet neighborhood. A little expensive, but ok. The beds and bedding were ok, but could be improved. The biggest problem we had was that it wasn't ready at checkin time. We know someone else who stayed there and had the same problem. We went in while the cleaning person was still working and the people before us had left a big mess, it appears.
But I would definitely stay there again, just plan that it might not be ready at checkin time."

Derek was very responsive to every request and concern. The master bed was very comfortable. There were weights, an elliptical, and a stationary bike in the garage gym! The yard is small but big enough for the dogs to go potty in. There’s a great park close by for the kids."

However, it was extremely quiet inside the house. The beds were very comfortable and the neighborhood was so quiet. Never stayed at a cleaner house, it was spotless. Would have been nice to have known there is not a working ice maker. Would definitely choose Janie’s home again!"
