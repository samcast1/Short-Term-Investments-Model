the place smelled like smoke and the neighborhood had abandoned buildings next door and across the street … would have liked to know that walking from downtown (which is close) was unsafe/unsmart at night"

Super Comfy bed and nicely appointed apartment with all we needed for a home away from home. I was given recommendations for local eatieries and events. very very responsive host as we arrived later and they made sure all was OK.

Stayed over a week","This was exactly what I needed for the few months I was in Huntington. The space felt just like home. Robert and Meredith were super hosts! I had one issue with one of the ac units shutting down and they had someone over that day to fix it. They were beyond kind and helpful but also respected my privacy as I was there for three months. They even went the extra mile to hang black out curtains in the bedroom when they found out I was working nights. The area is quiet during the day with some foot traffic. It can get a little busier on the street as the sun sets but I never felt unsafe. The kitchen has the basic cooking equipment, salt, pepper and cooking spray. The bathroom is awesome! Huge shower, soft fluffy towels and the bathroom heater is a total game changer! The bed and pillows were super soft. The TV has cable but no streaming capabilities, I just bought a cheap Roku and was set! If I ever find myself in Huntington I will absolutely be staying here again!"

The only complaint would be people stomping upstairs at 6am (just a warning for light sleepers). Also the shower was cold-ish/lukewarm, might want to look into that. Otherwise a very pleasant stay."

Stayed a few nights","Very clean, easy to find and easy check in/out. Some people mentioned the neighborhood is sketchy- I wouldn’t say sketchy—I wasn’t nervous- there are nice older homes all around and some run down building being renovated. Did hear some overhead footsteps from upstairs neighbors (very minimal- didn’t bother me at all). The only thing that bothered me was the bright light on the thermostat at night- if you like to sleep in complete darkness like me bring a sleep mask. Otherwise- no complaints. Bed is firm, but wonderful bedding and soft pillows! Highly recommend Bahnhof for dinner (1/2 mile away) and Hillbilly Hotdogs (several miles away- but worth the drive) for lunch! Great weekend getaway!"

Stayed one night","Super clean and minimally/tastefully decorated. I was just stopping through on my way through town on a long drive, it was spacious and comfortable, I felt like a queen! I did have to put a ‘W’ at the end of the street address to find the correct location, but the hosts were very helpful. Also to note, I was far too tired to unload my items in my car and it was not bothered on the street, appears to be a nice safe area. Would definitely stay again if passing through."

Stayed one night","Everything was great. There was an issue when we tried to use hot water, at first there was none and the water in kitchen and bath was barely warm. I contacted the owners and they called me and offered to cancel the trip or provide a partial refund in the morning (we didn't check in until midnight). Thankfully we tried again a few hours later and it was hot. the neighborhood seems a little shady but we were fine. The shower handle is kinds weird and confusing, so just turn it to 3:00 for hot water."

Stayed one night","I spent a nice evening in Huntington and enjoyed Meredith's house. For some, the outside of the house and the surrounding neighborhood may seem a bit sketchy, but the inside is perfect, and the neighborhood felt very safe. I walked a mile to ""The Market"" and had a salad and ice cream, which were both excellent, then walked back. It is a very interesting town, so much beautiful old architecture with original windows and details, much in disrepair but not spoiled by bad updates. The house is set up extremely well and had everything I needed. I would stay here again."

Super tidy and clean. Quiet, safe neighborhood and just up the hill from the main drag of restaurants and stores. We didn’t take our dog but would have been a good place for a pet. Our crazy GPS took us to the wrong house in the rain and dark, thankfully Melissa was quick to respond to our SOS. We really appreciated that! Would be our first choice when we return."

The location is also perfect. Quick access to route 60 and 64. Ample grocery stores within minutes. And only ten minutes to Marshall, Ritter Park, downtown Huntington. Ubers were also readily available.
Communication was on point and Melissa was so friendly and always fast to reply.

We even took a handful of acorns with us to plant at home. 😊We really appreciate the fact that she offers a PET-FRIENDLY place to stay when in the area, and you wouldn't even know other pets have been there because it is so clean!"

The beds were very comfortable there were lot's of options for restaurants within a 10 minute drive and also some very nice parks for dog walking.

Lots of extras, better than a hotel, like bath bombs, qtips, all the bath products, etc.
We were able to log into all of the streaming services easily with the account already set up. My only recommendation would be to put a spotlight on the address over the garage, or hang a house number on the fence near the road. It was dark, so we had trouble seeing the house number. Other than that it was perfect!"

Overall, the only issue I had was that the door was a little bit tricky to lock when you left, but my sister was able to help me out, so that’s more than likely a skill issue on my part.
If you need a place to stay in Huntington, definitely do not hesitate to stay here!"

We had our dogs with us and it was a great house for them, too, especially with the fenced in yard. Room sizes felt just right to be cozy and feel at home-not too big and not too small. We were not far from a dog park, which was a good spot in the middle of a lovely larger park. While we didn’t take advantage of them since we were headed to the eclipse in Ohio, it appeared from the map that there were a number of popular local restaurants nearby, as well. Wendy was a great host, providing all the info we needed. While we didn’t have questions during our stay, her responsiveness in general made us feel like she would be quickly available if we needed anything."

It was a cute and cozy home with all instructions clearly labeled or in the binder. Both checking in and out were simple and easy, and the checkout list was common sense items. The back yard and the porch was great for my dog; I had a convenient and sheltered spot to watch my dog while she inspected the surroundings (she approves by the way!) Snacks and coffee were also available, which was really great to have handy instead of running out or Door Dashing something while I’m getting my things together. Oh, and I loved the decor! Totally spotted a small flowerpot painted like Isabelle from Animal Crossing along with other nerdy items and thought “My people!” lol!
I had a great stay, and I plan on looking for this spot to be reservable for any future visits. Thanks again Wendy!"

The kitchen was stocked with cooking utensils so we didn’t have to eat out every day. Definitely would use recommend and go stay again!

Stayed with a pet","This is our third year staying at the Dollhouse and we plan to stay again on our next trip to Huntington. Wendy's Airbnb is comfortable and homey. It is very clean and complete with everything you need, including kitchen utensils, pots/pans, spices, etc. She provides a basket of snacks on the kitchen table and also has coffee. We haven't slept in the guest room, but the king sized mattress in the main bedroom is very comfortable. The sofas in the family room are also very comfortable. Wendy's decorations are always fun to look at. She has decorated in an eclectic manner and I always notice something new. The location is great. Ritter park is close by, Marshall and downtown Huntington are not far away. Access to I-64 and restaurants are also close by. The only ""negative"" is that there is only street parking available, but we never had an issue parking directly in front of the house. Wendy is an exceptional hostess and extremely responsive. I highly recommend her home!"

Her coffee station and snacks were so amazing and very welcome after a long day of travel! I will be staying here again every trip I make home - it was the perfect location !!!

Host was very quick to respond anytime I reached out and also allowed us an early check in as our plane landed at 1130 and we had no where to go until 3. All in all itwas a great stay and an amazing trip.

Street is cobblestone - charming but kidney jarring and with all having to park in the street, it’s tough passing and driving through. King bed was comfy and TVs, wifi worked great. Great location to drive to Mothman Festival! Would definitely recommend. 😊 Brickyard Pizza & Raw Bar was our favorite. Hibachi Japanese was okay. Lots of precarious steps in and out. Coffee and snacks provided were nice."

The kitchen always has everything we need, there are lots of little extras in the bathroom in case you forgot anything. The beds are comfortable, and there’s plenty of space to spread out. There’s a nice work area in the living room, but my husband still works at the kitchen table. He says that’s comfortable, too. Our little dog enjoys the back yard immensely. I don’t remember if I mentioned this after our last visit, but Wendy updated the bathtub and it is LOVELY. I would definitely take a sit down bath in there now! I know others had commented on it, but it is amazing now!!

Stayed one night","My family and I enjoyed our short stay at the Dollhouse. The house was spotless and hooked up with current technology (digital thermostat, WiFi, smart tvs). The back porch was really impressive with built in benches and a gazebo style structure. We were only there for one night but it would be a comfortable stay for several nights if needed. I did find the decor a little confusing. It’s called the dollhouse but doesn’t resemble one at all. Each room had some decor from different countries (UK, France, and Thailand?) but also had some doctor who and Alice in wonderland decor as well. I did really like some of the vintage pieces but overall, it didn’t all seem to go together. The outdoors areas could use some TLC. A good pressure washing and landscaping would really bring the backyard to its full potential."

Stayed with a pet","This is our second time staying at this property. Having stayed at several AirBnBs, this property is by far the cleanest and most homey one we have stayed in. The sofas and beds are comfortable. The host adds welcoming touches like a snack basket with goodies and fruit. The kitchen is very well stocked with utensils, pots, pans, spices, condiments and more. There are plenty of towels, a full size washer and dryer, laundry detergent, etc. There are also plenty of shampoos, conditioners, body washes, toilet paper, etc. Dogs are allowed and there is a fenced yard. The house is one the cleanest I have stayed in. The house cleaner does an excellent job! Wendy was quickly responsive when I reached out to her.
The only potential “negatives” for some may be that you have to park on the street in front of the house and there are some steps to climb so if you have more than one vehicle, have trouble parallel parking or trouble with steps, you would need to consider these things."

She had the coffee bar stocked and a welcome basket of snacks. Wendy had the necessary cooking items, including casserole dishes. Especially enjoyed the easy use television streaming for all the games with Hulu Live(nice feature). Parking was never a problem in front of the home. Dollhouse allowed easy access to downtown especially our favorites, Butter it Up and Austin’s. Our fur balls were model guests and enjoyed the backyard and all its’ prior visitors."

Stayed with a pet","I felt myself becoming genderfluid when I walked into this remodeled bungalow, as I looked down to my dog and said, “Wow bud, this place is so cute!” This is by far the best Air BnB I’ve ever stayed at. I usually look for the bargains, but decided to treat myself a little bit more while I was in my Nana’s hometown. I’ve been traveling as I move across the country, and I had stopped in Huntington to spread my Nana’s ashes. When Wendy found out about this by communicating with me through the app, she did everything possible to help me in finding where my Nana’s actual home neighborhood was, and she was of great help! I never met her in person, but she was very kind and helpful throughout our stay, and she has also made this listing extremely accommodating. I could go into detail, but it’s so much more fun to see how lovely the place is yourself. Also: anyone who has FILMMAKER MODE as the default picture setting on the TV as well as David Foster Wallace on the bookshelf has extremely good taste. I plan on settling down in North Carolina to live, but we will definitely come back to this bungalow for a little vacation if it is still available in the near-future!"

Lack of television channels or ability to use a smart device. nice to have been able to relax and watch some TV while I worked. I say this because of the price comparison alone.

Aside from that this place is awesome. Very well put together. I definitely plan to come here again. The local hotels should take notes on his cleanliness"

Stayed with kids","Overall our stay was fine. I wish Geanina had mentioned how narrow of an alley way it was to a very steep stairwell to get to the apartment. Also, the stairs and outside door are black which got very hot to the touch due to sun exposure. The listing also mentioned a sofa bed but in fact it was just a futon. A very uncomfortable futon at that. We also noticed the subfloor in the bathroom had a lot of give to it which could be a safety concern in the future. The photos also made the space seem bigger than it was. Overall I probably would not stay again due to the space size, narrow alleyway, and uncomfortable futon. But it was very clean and had freebies like water and soaps."

Garrett's place had everything I needed EXCEPT a recycling container. I noticed the neighbors and public places I went to during my stay did have recycling, so I am hopeful that this airbnb can provide that for future guests.

Group trip","The location of this house is close to a beautiful park, but the backyard faces an alleyway and the trash from that building. Parking is really tight. The house has a very small driveway but it was mud covered so not useable during our stay. I would recommend this place to someone traveling for work with plans to eat at restaurants and not for a family planning to cook. We had to go out and buy bowls and serving spoons and a can opener and had to toast our bagels in the oven because the house doesn’t have a toaster. The appliances that were provided were fine and toiletries were provided, which was nice. The table seats 6. The heating was pretty typical of an old house, so it was not the same temperature downstairs and upstairs but space heaters do make the upstairs comfortable."

The neighborhood was quiet, and I loved the proximity to Ritter Park. Just make sure that you keep a watchful eye on your dog when they're in the backyard because in the wintertime, there is a significant gap in the fencing which most likely isn't an issue in the summer because it would fully grown up there."

Our only complaint was the temperature! The high temp that day was 31. When we walked into the house it was 63 and took a long time to heat up the space. Two space heaters are provided in the bedrooms which was listed in the description but we assumed it was in addition to central heat. There is NO central heat upstairs. Sleeping in cooler rooms is fine but the evening programmable thermostat of 63 downstairs is a bit chilly and even cooler upstairs. No extra blankets were provided with only a sheet and light bed covering to keep warm. We moved the smaller space heater to the bathroom to take a shower. I slept on the sofa downstairs with our own dog blankets and layers of clothing. Kept waking up all night to reprogram the thermostat to 72."

Stayed one night","Huntington is a city with a lot of history and Garrett has a lovely house in a historic neighborhood. Garrett has kept a lot of the cool features of the house like the narrow width oak floors and claw-foot bathtub, but updated the bathrooms and kitchen. We had an easy check in, walked through Ritter Park, enjoyed dinner at the Nawab Fine Indian restaurant downtown and then slept great. A big plus for us was that we could keep our bicycles in the house overnight!"

We came in for a concert at the Arena and it was a convenient, easy location, we were able to be away from the chaos but close enough to get there and back quickly. It’s a nice part of town and close to the fountain at Ritter park. The off street parking was nice, as the neighborhood streets are tight. All the amenities you need for a quick stay are here. Beds and bedding are super comfy and we all slept very soundly. TIP: It was a hot, hot day when we arrived, so turn the air conditioners on upstairs upon arrival to give it time to cool. Garret was great to work with and we are glad we chose an Airbnb instead of a hotel. We would definitely come back if we come this way again."

Stayed a few nights","We definitely recommend Garrett's House. I wish this review allowed us to give Garrett more then five stars. Garrett's communication and service were much more than we expected. Garrett went beyond the extra mile to ensure we had everything we needed for a successful stay.
The house was comfortable, clean, and quiet. We were very close to local coffee houses and restaurants. We were also within walking distance of a beautiful park and Pickleballs courts. We had everything we needed."

Group trip","Lovely place to stay!
Full disclosure: this was my grandparents house for decades; they left in 1992 for sunnier climes and to be close to their adult children as they aged.
The home has been renovated and updated; now very light-filled, especially on the main floor. Some of the original character is maintained, such as the original claw-foot bathtub.
The host is very responsive; check-in is a breeze. Superb location for proximity to Ritter Park and downtown; the Marshall crash site for Southern Flt 932 is easily reached and worth visiting.
I visited with my sister to make a “family heritage pilgrimage” one last time. Until my generation, both sides of my family for many generations were born and raised in Huntington.
Choose this place to stay no matter the reason for your visit. It’s extremely comfortable, safe, and convenient for whatever you’ll be doing."

The house is nothing short of cute and quaint, an absolute gem, with a touch of warmth, and some amazing art pieces. The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance to a beautiful park. The house itself has everything you would need to be comfortable. There is an updated kitchen, a large dining room table, and a papasan chair in a little nook that instantly became my favorite place to sit. The bathrooms were spotless, as were the bedrooms. I have nothing bad to say about it and I would 10/10 book this house again!"

Safe, quiet neighborhood within just steps of Ritter Park to take nice walks. Our hosts were communicative and provided a spotlessly clean place to stay. Just a short few minute drive to some great coffee and food spots All in all couldn’t say anything negative even if we wanted to."

It is a beautiful older home with lots of charm. The beds are extremely comfortable and the house has everything you could need. We took several of Garrett’s recommendations on places to visit and were beyond satisfied with them all. Garrett was a pleasure to communicate with, he was always quick to respond and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I sent him a message asking if he had something at the house and he had it delivered to us during our stay. I would definitely recommend Garrett’s place and would stay again if in the area."

Both bedrooms had A/C and idk about the main floor, but it was 90 degrees out and we were always comfortable. But, we were also only there in the evening and overnight. Lots of fun creative art, felt like we got to see the host's personal quirky style. (one of my fave parts about staying in AirBNBs). The house isn't in the most immaculate condition (a couple cracks in the paint, some wood warping), but it was clean and comfy. We only stayed one night, and it was around $145. Considering the amount of space, cleanliness, location and quality, we thought it was perfectly priced."

Parking is convenient with a driveway/carport. On the corner there is a cute local store with a deli/bakery which we easily walked to for coffee. Just a mile or two in the other direction there are several antique shops and cafes/restaurants along Central City. As for the space, it was thoughtfully and beautifully decorated and had unique touches such as a wireless printer and Roomba to keep floors clean that made the stay stand out and made us feel right at home. The gas stove in the kitchen is a dream, sad we didn’t have more time to use it. The house was very clean and the king bed/bedding so comfortable I want to buy the sheets. Hosts were super nice, always very responsive and provided a local guide. I have more good things to say but am running out of space. We would be delighted to stay again and will be back!

The history about the location was fascinating & Chessie the cat was everywhere you turned 😊!
I was nervous about returning in the dark with the steps & being located around back but this was not a issue. There were many lights to light our way. Bright Lights Everywhere!
River & park are directly across the street w/walkways, river swings, amphitheater w/hopes of next time to be able to enjoy more.
The Outside steps going to the second story to enter are grated and you can see through them. A little frightening for someone like me who is afraid of heights but it wasn’t terrible. The mat on the top step was very helpful.

Stayed with kids","This was a great spot for traveling with two small kids. Parking was very easy and convenient. There’s no neighbors other than the candle store downstairs. The space was not huge but perfect for a small group or couple traveling. We used the pullout couch in the living room and closed the door between the bedroom & living room at night for privacy/to accommodate kids early bed time. The kitchenette had a mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker. So we were comfortable just hanging out. The location is within walking distance to a ton of shops and restaurants. We loved the patio at Taps At Heritage."

Stayed a few nights","The Chessie Room is cozy, convenient, and charming. If you have business or pleasure plans in downtown Huntington, this spot is perfect. Leave your vehicle and walk anywhere you need to go — shops, bars, convention areas, restaurants, entertainment, sightseeing. The bed is comfortable. The claw foot tub/shower is relaxing. And the historic railroad-themed decor is nicely suited to the feel of the surrounding area. Loved the fireplace and chairs, coffee bar, and the subtle ways Chessie’s adorable smile (on art, mugs, and towels — no real cat) made us feel welcome and comfortable. Glad we didn’t bring the kids, but if we had there would have been room for them, too. Excellent host! (Visitors should be aware that climbing steps is necessary to enter this historic and lovely room.)"

If you’re getting married at Heritage Station, be sure to book the Chessie room for not only the day/night of your wedding, but also the night before!! (There’s no early morning check in available if someone stays the previous night.) I hadn’t thought about this ahead of time and ended up with no place to get ready the morning of my wedding 🤦🏼‍♀️ so I wanted to share for the next bride so she could be better prepared!!"

My husband and I needed a date night close to home and Chessie room was just an hour away with many choices for a relaxing and fun night. The room itself was the perfect set up. As well as cozy and comfortable. The host, Stephen, was great with communication and check in was easy and convenient. If you choose one of the restaurants listed in his details make sure to call and make reservations, we chose one and we didn’t call and reserve and sadly we missed out on that experience. We will know for the next time! Highly recommend Chessie and all its quaint charm!!!"

There are stairs leading up to the entrance so keep that in mind if you have difficulty with stairs. This space is perfect for a couples get away or special occasion. It is not for the traveler looking for a budget friendly stay. We would stay here again."

Stayed one night",The Chessie B&B is such a charming place with wonderful appointments and amenities. Stephen has thought of everything -down to details that many hosts forget about. The coffee in the room is delicious-it’s a special blend which we raved about. The kitchen was perfect for our purposes and the bathroom was very clean with top shelf toiletries and towels. This b&b was meticulously cleaned and we so loved the location. We had a very short stay but still had time to walk on the nearby river walk and get in a bit of exercise after driving all day. The breakfast (included!) from a nearby cafe was so good we wanted to stay for lunch! The bed was comfy and this spot feels like a cozy home but with the right amount of sophistication. We are very pleased and would visit again.

The place is clean and very well decorated. You’ll love the claw foot tub and the bed is very comfortable. The location is perfect if you enjoy craft beers, wine, or whiskey since it’s only a few feet away from Taps and Sip which are two of my favorite places in town. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Huntington you’ll not find a nicer place."

Stayed about a week","What a superb stay we had at the Chessie B room!! We were in visiting my family for the holidays, and it was so nice to have our own space while in town. It is so nicely appointed and everything about it welcomes you in like a ‘warm hug’ :-)
Stephen is such a wonderful host. He was super responsive to all of my questions and messages, and he was very accommodating when we requested an early check-in at the last minute. He met us upon our arrival to make sure everything was to our liking and to point out where everything essential was located. He provided lots of recommendations for restaurants both within walking distance and those a bit farther away, as well as pointing out the wine and whiskey bar and tap room that are just a stone’s throw away. He made sure to provide extra towels and linens, if needed, as we were staying for a week.
The location of the Chessie B room is so ideal. It is located in Heritage Station, which is a historic train station in downtown Huntington that is now filled with small, local businesses (including the wine and whiskey bar I mentioned above, as well a lovely local bakery and gift shop). Pullman Plaza is just a little over a block away, and the downtown businesses are well within walking distance.
The apartment is very comfortable and is so quiet........it allowed us to have a peaceful space for working while in town. It was sparkling clean upon our arrival, and our kitchenette was stocked with essentials such as coffee, tea and bottled water. Lots of interesting bits of history are found throughout, and there are some beautiful antique pieces throughout the space. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and plenty of towels. There is also plenty of free parking at hand in the parking lot for Heritage Station.
We loved our stay at the Chessie B room and hope to stay again whenever we are back in a Huntington :-)"

Stayed a few nights","This place is BEAUTIFUL... so tastefully decorated, immaculately clean, has soft blankets, thoughtful amenities, great location, easy to find, good parking, very quiet. I arrived very late due to traffic issues but everything was well-lit and I felt safe getting my things into the apartment. Stephen checked on me the next morning, which was a nice touch. It was truly a peaceful refuge and wonderful relaxing home away from home while traveling on business. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","After having lived in this town for years and seeing it grow even after leaving, this cute little BnB is a great addition! Enough space for the two of us and for some friends to come hang out before we left to go to dinner in town. We even got to enjoy a live music show right next door on our last night. Stephen provided us with coupons for two tasty coffee shops right downstairs which was a very sweet amenity. He was very quick to respond and answer any questions we had. I know we will definitely come back here anytime we come to visit. Can't wait!"

Group trip","The house was beautiful and clean. There were a few things that I was disappointed with. First, we were not allowed to use the back yard due to another attendant renting an apartment in the back of the house. Second, we received a message from the host regarding the noise level, stating that there was a noise meter in the house in which we exceeded. I thought this was really ridiculous being that we did not play any music nor watch tv, only laughing and talking with family. The other thing about this location is that the host lives across the street, nothing like feeling watched the entire visit. We found this out after the host saw that a family member smokes and she offered to bring us a chair, which she did not. We did not feel like this was a location to make you feel like “A home away from home “ like the airbnb motto states. So if you have a loud family like mine, this is not the place for you."

There was no outside space, but we knew that when booking. The sidewalks were nice to get out and take a walk.
Everything was well explained, even the coffee pot (for those of us who’ve never used a keurig 😆) and the heating/cooling system.
Initially, We couldn’t get into the door because the number didn’t save properly- but Debra was quick to fix it, very responsive- even though she was in Walmart at the time ❤️
We had cruddy weather, but she send me some great ideas to do with the kids."

The host has labels all over the home, and it made it easy to move right in and feel like we were in our own home. The beds were amazing and extremely comfortable!!! The kitchen was setup with everything we needed. We loved having the Roku TVs. They were super convenient. The washer and dryer were super helpful since we stayed for an entire week. The only slightly negative issue for us was that there seemed to be some lingering smoke. We reached out to the host right away, and she tried to help us feel comfortable in the home. Other than that, we have absolutely no complaints at all. We would definitely consider staying there again in the future! Thank you for the wonderful home away from home!!"

I can say without a doubt this property is above expectations and the host definitely goes out of the way to make sure her guests have everything they would need. For example: I completely forgot to bring my cell phone charger with me. There was a Wireless Charging pad on the nightstand that came in clutch! This listing is highly recommended if you are ever in the Huntington area. 10/10"

Stayed with kids","We checked in with ease very late at night after a long drive. The porch light and the light on in the living room made the house easy to find on a relatively dark street, and check-in was simple. The home was great and exactly as described. We utilized all three bedrooms, and both the bed linens and bath towels were pristine. The hosts have provided a great coffee/tea bar and snacks. There are very nice touches, like a wireless charger for a phone in one bedroom, water and ice maker in the fridge, and clearly labeled amenties throughout. If you are TV watchers, 2 of the 3 bedrooms also have TVs.
We were in town to visit Marshall University, and it was a quick 10 minute drive. We ate dinner one night at the Marshall Cafe, one of Debbie's recommended spots, clearly frequented by local families and students.
Overall, Debbie was a gracious host, and if our son chooses Marshall, this will be our go-to spot!"

She’s also done a great job at decorating the rooms and making it easy to “navigate” the house - like labeling the contents of the drawers and cabinets in the kitchen.

She was instantly on it and proactive. After a few messages, a cleaner arrived with a new key. Also, the AC had to be reset, and she showed me step by step. The outside porch is wonderful to sit at. The color scheme is beautiful(I love Teal). Everything you need is in the kitchen. The tub is a nice size, and the BEDS were seriously comfortable!! 5 stars across the board. I work for a property management group, and this is the type of service that should be had. If I'm ever in Huntington again, this is where I would stay."

Stayed one night","The place is super cute and given the chance to stay here again I probably would. However, I didn’t give it 5 stars for a few reasons, which were: the air unit was broke in the living room and would leak whenever it was on (which was an issue that was being addressed by the owner however not until after our stay due to availability of someone to fix it). In addition, it took 4 or 5 times to get into the unit from the outside door. The instructions are clear, the lock on the door just moves quickly if you don’t open it right away. Also, the gate was difficult to open from the inside. Aside from those things, the place really was a nice stay. The beds and couch were comfortable. The amenities were nice, particularly the complimentary streaming services and full kitchen. And the host was very communicative."

LOVE THE UPSTAIRS PORCH!!! I grew up in Brooklyn, and I literally forgot how nice it is to sit on a FRONT Porch and just chill. All in all just a great place. If life ever brings us back to Huntington, we will be staying here again."

Stayed with kids","This was a great spot to stay in Huntington, and we really appreciated the host's responsiveness! There was a small HVAC issue when we arrived that required us to reset a breaker, but C walked us through it clearly and quickly, allowing us to resolve it first thing and have a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights",This was one of the most enjoyable airbnb stays I've ever had. C was an awesome host. She answered all my questions with a quickness. Everything was very clean and had every amenity you could ever need during your stay. Beds are comfortable. The balcony was also very nice. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends and Co workers. 20/10 will be staying again if ever in the area again!! Thank you C!

Stayed one night",This apartment was very nice and was well stocked. It is a second floor apartment with no elevator access which could be difficult for some people. It worked well for our family of three. You have to park on the street. We would recommend this apartment for a stay.

Group trip","Terrific Teal was a cute & cozy place to stay. The owner was very hospitable, did a great job with the place and furnished everything we needed to stay for a long weekend. The apartment was clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen was well-equipped. There was hardly any traffic there and the road noise was minimal so we enjoyed a lot of our daytime outdoors on the spacious covered porch. I would definitely return to this location. I can tell the owner takes great pride in ensuring a comfortable stay and the location is quite convenient to everything."

Stayed one night","It's a very clean and fun place. The decor is not ""warm"" to me but that's ok. Very cute spaces and I wish I had been able to use it for a longer period. Interesting building that it's in. We (3 of us) couldn't get the wall-unit HVACs to work. Just beep to turn on but no fan/temp changes. In fairness to the host, we were there late and didn't try to rectify the problem. We used a space heater in one room but ended up getting too hot. :-D Overall a fun place."

Stayed over a week","I stayed at C’s place for a long term rental as a travel nurse and I will say it was perfect. Close to the hospital, close to restaurants, grocery store, etc. C is a great host! She is quick to respond and to get whatever you need! The place is cozy and has an awesome balcony! I would recommend C’s place to anyone looking for a short, fun weekend or long term stay!"

Stayed a few nights",I was C’s first guest and was able to book last minute when my initial place was no longer available. I really enjoyed my stay and she was very responsive and helpful throughout. Her place is well located and you can walk to most places. A Kroger grocery store is only a seven minute walk. I enjoyed cooking on the gas stove (wish I had my own). I recommend her place to anyone needing accommodations in the Huntington area. I’ll for sure keep it in mind if I’m ever back that way.
