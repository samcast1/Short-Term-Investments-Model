Stayed a few nights","Antiria’s place was exactly as it was described. Small, but perfect for a solo traveler. There was a full kitchen, so I was able to save some money by cooking there which I appreciated. She was very responsive - I extended my trip an extra day. The bed was incredibly comfortable as well and I slept like a baby."

Stayed with kids",Emilee was such a great host as I gave her short notice on a one night stay from Ohio to Florida. As far as the property it’s one of the nicest of not the nicest places we have ever stayed at. Lots of room for at least 6. I could go on and on about every little detail but all I can say is I had my wife and 2 kids tell me it was amazing and they wanted to go back sometime when we weren’t in such a rush.

Stayed one night",I had a smile on my face the instant I pulled into the driveway. This place looked great in the advertisement but exceeded expectations in person. The home and property are gorgeous. Inside and outside are immaculate. There is no lack of attention to detail with the layout. It has just about everything you could want in a secluded getaway. The host was always responsive and helpful. I had a very enjoyable time. This is the kind of place I would love to have when I retire. I would highly recommend.

Stayed with a pet","When we walked into this place it literally looked like we were walking into an HGTV dream home. This house is so beautifully decorated and impeccably clean. Pictures don't do it justice. Emilee provided soft linens & towels, super comfortable beds, state of the art appliances, and a serene outdoor living space. She also sent a personal text on our way there. Really nice touch. We loved it so much we wanted to move in. : )
We can't wait to come back!"

Emilee and Tony are both two of the kindest, most welcoming people I think I have ever met. I stay at a whole lot of Airbnb’s, as I travel weekly, with my company. I have had a whole lot of great experiences, but these two, are simply amazing.
Everything is just perfect. I don’t know how else to put it. I can say that pictures, cannot do justice, to how this home actually is. I will definitely be back. Thank you Emilee and Tony.
I’ll never forget your kindness."

Stayed a few nights","This place is amazing, I would not hesitate to stay here ever time I am in the area. It’s beautiful designed, the two beds give you an option of either soft or a more firm bed. Having back issues this was definitely a plus. There is a nice deck on the back, with a table and umbrella, some beautiful lighting other than the porch which makes a nice feel to have a nice dinner out there. I highly recommend this place. The host is an outstanding hostess and she has other properties which I have stayed at one of the other properties. And the condition of that other property is just as fabulous."

Stayed about a week","Corey went above & beyond for my family. As we were preparing for the loss of my grandmother, he was extremely flexible with check-in and check-out. That relieved a lot of stress during a very stressful personal period.
The place was definitely a home. We felt right at home nearly right away. The kitchen has most of the modern needs. The air conditioning was great for days above 95 degrees F / 35 degrees C.
The host was extremely responsive before, during, and after our stay (left earrings behind). I highly recommend this location to any traveler in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Booking and communicating with Corey prior to check in was easy and prompt. Corey's place was perfect for our weekend stay for my daughter's graduation. Wish I realized this place was avaliable years ago, I would've continued booked Corey's place instead of a hotel. The area was under severe weather warnings the day of our arrival, Corey took time out of his day that day to notify me. Many small things noted within the unit to help with your stay, snacks, travel size amenities if you forgot yours, etc. The only negative thing I can say is, it smells like cat pee when you first walk up. The unit itself does not though. Highly recommend."

The small dining area was cute with a coffee theme. The living room set up was nice, with the TV in a prominent location, along with an assortment of books.
Getting into and out of the condo was easy and safe, due to clear instructions. We did communicate with Corey A., and he promptly responded.
This was a great location to get away and enjoy Americus and Plains."

Stayed over a week","The condo is everything promised in the description. It was clean, located in a good area and had everything needed for a perfect vacation. I had one major issue that made my rating low. I am travel nurse and rented the entire unit for one month. I never had company and only left the occupancy to go to work and to get something to eat. I allowed another female travel nurse to stay for a little over a week as she transitioned to a new nursing assignment. Corey inquired about the occupant because he voted the cameras and noticed her car there. I explained the situation to him, asked if I needed to provide her information and told her that she would not be there long. He told me that this would be alright. She left for a weekend then came back to finish her last shift at the hospital. After looking in the cameras and seeing her car in the driveway again, he have me an ultimatum to pay an additional $1000+ or vacate the premises in 4 days. He explained that the increase in price was to cover him for liability of she was hurt on the premises or her car was broken into (both of which should be covered by insurance). He also informed me that he was aware of our comings and goings and had dates and time stamps on his camera. I am single woman traveling in a new city so I was very concerned to learn that my every move was being watched. I was also concerned about the increase in price when I clearly paid for the entire unit and not per person. I decided to take him up on his offer and leave early. He reimbursed my money quickly and contacted Airbnb to make sure that everything was resolved appropriately. I heard of people increasing prices for Airbnb for travel nurses but I never experienced this until now. I had to make other preparations to find another place to stay (currently a hotel) which was a huge inconvenience. Most concerning to me was the constant monitoring of the cameras, the unexpected price increase for a guest staying for a week and being asked to leave after I offered to give him the information on the guest when he initially asked for it."

Stayed with kids",Place was great. Location was on a beautiful street lined with amazing homes. Large parks within walking distance. If your not against walking most everything is within a 10-20 min walk. Home has everything you could want and more- you’d want for nothing. Beds were little stiff for my liking but that more a matter of preference than anything specifically wrong with the place. Would definitely recommend and would definitely consider staying again whenever I plan another trip back to Americus. Thanks Corey!!

Stayed a few nights","The place was fine -- except -- that queen bed just isn't very comfy. Also, microwave didn't work. Mattress is one of the older style with interior springs and it made noise with every tiny little movement on my side. There were enough other pillows where we could substitute for the plasticized-covered ones too. Great location to see Plains, Providence Canyon, and Andersonville. We never met Corey or Edna, but communication was easy, check-in and out simple."

Stayed with kids","Corey's place is delightful! It is truly a gem in the middle of Americus. We could not have asked for a better stay.
The location of the condo is great. It is in a lovely neighborhood that is easy to walk. You are close enough to the downtown area if you're a walker and a about a 5 - 8 minute drive if you are not. And, you are also an 8 minute drive from the ""main strip"" where you'll find all of the major stores/amenities for the are.
The condo complex is quiet, and the parking area is more than enough for 2 cars. Inside the unit, the decor is simple and modern. Everything is just enough to make it feel like home. The kitchen is well appointed and includes a Keurig. There is a washer and dryer which is always a plus when traveling with a family. Had we stayed longer, we definitely would have taken advantage of the back patio. The condo is VERY CLEAN. As a picky mom, this was very important to me. The beds are comfortable. All of the basics are provided (e.g., towels, linens, etc.).
Corey is an excellent communicator. He was very responsive to all of my inquiries. He was even able to accommodate our late check-out. And, when I realized that I'd left a few personal items, he offered to mail them back to me.
Should we come back to see President Carter again or just for a weekend away from the hustle and bustle of Atlanta, Corey's condo is where we'll be when in Americus!"

They are friendly and helpful, meeting us on arrival and helping us get settled, walking us through the ins and out of the camper and even offered us extra supplies with our stay being during some of the coldest nights in winter! It was awesome to bring my pups along for the trip!"

Stayed one night","Farah and Brian offer a one of a kind Airbnb, and a one of a kind location, with one of a kind hosts!
The pecan orchard is such a serene and unique location, if you leave without feeling centered, and at peace, that’s own fault! 😂 they secluded sound of silent nature, the friendly flock of pasture chickens clucking around, a crackling fire in the orchard fire pit and the zip line in the woods… You read that right… Make for one of the best days I’ve ever had at an Airbnb.
Above this beautiful space, the accurately described and comfortable camper, the genuine customer service and plenty of room to roam around…I hope they don’t mind us coming back for an escape every time we can!
For fellow writers, readers, people/families trying to escape the grind or to just take a break to find a peace of mind, The Pecan Orchard is just for you.
Y’all save a couple weekends for us! ♥️❤️♥️"

Stayed with a pet","The trailer was perfect for a one night stay. More than big enough! The surrounding area was peaceful among the pecan trees. There is a large bunk room to house 4 kids. Not big enough for grown adults. Full size couch which was comfortable along with a queen bedroom. There was an outside area lit up with rope and strand lights, but we did not utilize this area during our stay.
The bathroom is small (as with all trailers) and looks a bit intimidating at first. My husband says the shower was more than suitable to move around in. The water lasted awhile too.
Perfectly nice hosts. Came down to explain the trailer switches for lights and shower “booster heater” to keep the water hotter for longer."

Stayed with a pet","went to America's for my brother's funeral, was looking for something that would be relaxing and quiet after a couple of really rough days. I am first time Air BNB user so while looking for hotels that were pet friendly I got an Airbnb ad so I thought I would check it out. I am so glad I did.Farah and her family could not have been any better host. She went above and beyond anything we even imagined a host would do.
she and her family were very attentive to our needs, very nicely answered the millions of questions I had for her and was very gracious about it.
The scenery was beautiful and we loved the chickens that live on the property. this whole experience made a very sad trip quite a bit better.
I highly recommend the pecan orchard campground to anyone that wants to get away from all the hustle and bustle and noise and just enjoy the beautiful peace and quiet of the country.
I would give Farah a thousand stars review if I could"

It’s a very short drive to a superwalmart which has plenty of groceries and anything else you might want to have during your stay.
My family and I felt right at home and the location is great for visiting downtown Americus. Radium springs is also a short drive away. A lot to learn about in the area if you enjoy history. We will definitely stay here again if we are visiting Americus."

Stayed a few nights","Dana was amazing! We had change in plans for check and she was so accommodating! She even came and introduced herself! The house was immaculate! Everything you need or could ever want. Snacks and water upon arrival, the bathroom was stocked so even if you forgot something she had it! Every nock and cranny had a beautiful decoration and the outside was beautiful with flowers , swing and birds chirping!
Even though there was no WIFI in some parts of the house I could get some reception. Peaceful and quiet and so very relaxing. We came to watch some baseball at GSW and it took us less than 15 min to get to town.
Thanks Dana we will definitely rebook if we come back up!"

Stayed with kids",Dana was very nice . The barn was smaller than expected but it was super cute and very clean. It was close to Dana’s house but they did not disturb us at all. Dana was very gracious and had snacks for us. It was extremely quiet and peaceful. Would love to have been there in winter as there was a cute fireplace . Dish tv was a plus . Wish I could have spent more time there and walked the massive property . It’s close to the city of Americus and not too far from Plains Ga the home of Jimmy Carter. Wish the property was a bit cheaper as I’d love to stay again.

Mrs. Dana was very polite and even took it upon herself to check in on us. A very cozy place, would recommend to anyone who wanted to stay away from constant traffic zooming by (hotels) but not wanting to stay 30-40 minutes away from town to do so. It was also very easy to find and just a few simple roads so no worries in getting lost."

It was affordable, cute, comfortable, and homey. The temperature was excellent inside, not hot at all in the summer heat.

Bedroom is very roomy. Bathroom is also fine except it takes time for the hot water to come out. Bed is comfortable. Bedroom could be better with a bedside table with reading lamp. I also gave Margaret some feedback regarding the outward appearance from the street.
I came here because I wanted to visit Plains, President Carter's home and birthplace. It is just 10 miles away so Margaret's was a perfect spot. It is also not far from Andersonville, a notorious Confederate prison during the Civil War. Worth a visit if you are into history. There is also a good Mexican restaurant downtown.
Overall a very good value."

my first experience with vacasa, when asked for assistance with a potential left item I was met with extra fees and no personal touch. $25 just to look for a pair of headphones. during this last experience I tried to change the dates of our stay by one day and was immediately told that that was not within their allowable rules. as I said, quite rigid. not what I am used to with most airbnb hosts. otherwise a good experience."

Stayed with kids","We had a great time on our two nights stay. Jennifer was a great host and the place was clean with plenty of towels and extras. First night we loved using the fire pit to roast hotdogs and marshmallows. We brought our own wood but there was a huge stack already available. Next day we went to Providence Canyon (the reason for the trip) and it was a quick 25 minute drive. A most do, it’s beautiful. On the way back we stopped by Richland Rum Distillery and did a tour and tasting. Loved hearing how the rum was made and of course the tasting was great. The best part about this place was waking up in the morning and sitting on the back porch with a cup of coffee. The view is beautiful and relaxing. Oh and the beds were super comfortable too. I recommend Jennifer’s place. Looks just like the photos. I would come again if visiting this area."

Group trip","Jennifer was a great host. We had a wifi issue due to a storm that had just passed and she and her husband came by to help trouble shoot, call the Internet Company and it was all up and running in a few hours. Wifi worked amazingly well after that. House is super clean and has everything you need for your stay. Only thing that was a bit annoying is that there’s a lot of flys and bugs but that’s not her fault. We are in the middle of Summer and that tends to Happen around this time of year. We got to see deers from the back porch which was super Cool and a must do is the providence canyon. IT’S HUGEEE!!! Very beautiful scenery. Thank you Jennifer for great stay ❤️"

Stayed with a pet","Husband, two furbabies and I did a road trip that included a brief stop in Providence Canyon. It was very hard to find a clean and affordable place that allowed dogs. Every place we checked and allowed dogs had very questionable reviews and pictures on the cleanliness and it was super small for the price. That being said after weeks of searching somehow we came across this gem. YES A GEM! The place is as described, SUPER CLEAN and the host provides plenty of towels and cleaning supplies for your comfort and more essentials that you can take advantage of. The location is secluded as expected. We finished exploring Providence Canyon quicker than expected and needed something to do. I reached out to the host and she GUIDED ME in the right direction. We had amazing and TASTY peanut butter ice cream, and boiled peanuts, we visited the Rum Distillery and ended up eating at a Mexican Restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in this area stop looking this is exactly what you need."

Stayed a few nights","I go to AirBnBs quite regularly as I love to explore in my free time and I also have a job that requires travel very regularly.
Usually, AirBnBs will be set up similarly to hotel rooms - they will have Towels, ToiletPaper, Coffee, AFewMugs, AFewPlates, and a SetOfLinens.
This AirBnb is nothing like that. This place feels like a house that is meant to be lived in. It is fully stocked in every way. Additionally, there were many accessories in this AirBnB that I have never seen in others - like placemats, coasters to set hot pans on, and a hook by the door for keys.
The home is immaculately sealed, as I did not see a single bug or fly or any creature otherwise during my entire stay.
The vibe is more like staying at a family member's home while they are out of town, as opposed to crashing in a motel. Truthfully, it is perhaps the most well thought-out AirBnB I have ever been to. The host is prompt, kind, and very informative. I have no complaints!"

Stayed a few nights","My son and I came up for father’s day trip from Pensacola to hike Providence Canyon and to visit the POW Museum at Andersonville. We found our accommodations just as described. It is an older manufactured home, but don’t judge the book by the cover! Inside was clean and well-supplied, all the stuff works, and it was very comfortable. Kitchen was stocked with coffee(!) and condiments, and toiletries were provided. We really enjoyed sitting out on the back deck, it’s totally private and faces a farm field, where we saw deer and a variety of birds. We were very happy with the place."

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean, UT the terrible mold smell in the entire house, and the linen closet was insane. I booked it for 3 days, and if I slept 8 hrs from the entire trip, it was a lot. The host told me first the smell, probably from the old wood from the trailer being that its old and vintage and then told me they had no idea. Between candles and febreeze, it made a difference."

The icing on the cake was flavored coffee cream in the fridge chilling. That was awesome. The place had a charming Georgian feel as we experienced the sunrise on the back porch. She also provided a battery boost when our truck battery died as we were getting ready to leave, without a long wait. I recommend this place to anyone coming through this area and need a place to stay that is quiet, warm, and welcoming. Thanks Jennifer you are a super duper host. We will be back."

Her house is cozy and comfy and our favorite was definitely the front porch me and my children loved sitting outside and listening to the rain on the tin roof. Everything was clean and everything we needed was there. Jennifer herself is just one of the most pleasant hosts I have ever experienced, she goes above and beyond to make sure we are settled and have everything that we need. She definitely gets an A+ for her kindness. I highly recommend Jennifer's place and will definitely stay again!! 😁😁"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy place that had everything and more than I could ever need. The place was spotless and Jennifer was kind enough to leave the lights and AC on for me because I was arriving late in the evening. It was very easy to find. It was about 20 minutes or so away from my son’s college- all country roads, so no traffic. Do not let the look of the yard turn you away. This place is well worth staying at. The backyard is surrounded by beautiful woods, and there is a nice front and back porch. I was in and out at night and never saw any of the neighbors. I’m hoping to stay there again when I find out, for sure, when my son’s school is having parents weekend. I was going to stay at a hotel right down the street from my son’s school , but ended up having to take my mom’s dog with me because she was hospitalized. There was plenty of room for the dog to go about his business. You could even park a vehicle pulling a boat in the yard if you needed to. But, plan on taking groceries with you because there is nothing open nearby as far as restaurants/pizza in the late evening. But, hey, it’s out in the country, what else would you expect??!!"

Very convenient to Providence Canyon, Andersonville, Jimmy Carter’s home in Plains and Richland Rum distillery. I would definitely recommend!"

Stayed over a week","We are here for work so we are having to stay for a long period of time. We wanted something that was very homelike because we have a small child and also something pet friendly. I found this place and we absolutely love it! It’s so peaceful. Very clean! Very neat! It has all the things you need to live other than groceries of course! Every evening my fiancé and son like to watch the deer from the porch. Mrs. Jennifer and Mr. Joey are great people and have helped us with anything we needed. Once our stay is up, if we are ever in the area again, we will definitely choose this one!!"

I would note that there is no dishwasher, and not a lot of dinnerware provided, so you may consider paper and plastic. Overall, very basic kitchen items provided— we did not see a toaster provided. There were several lightbulbs out upon arrival along with used, wet washcloth and towels in the kitchen. I’d also note that the carport pole on the ground along the front sidewalk was a tripping hazard, especially at night. A reflective strip may be helpful."

Stayed a few nights","The house is a great size with lots of space. If that is what you are looking for then this is good. If you are looking for the air bnb that has the cute little added touches while being far from home, you will not find that here. I think with a little more work this will be a great airbnb , its just not there yet. We unfortuately had a storm while we were there and lost electricity for more then 24 hours, there were no flashlights which put us in an uncomfortable position. We lost the food we had in the fridge and had to find somewhere that had power so that we could shower. Because we flew into the area we did not travel with household items and were a little taken back that you are responsible for your own trash bags, I think knowing that you should come completely prepared we would of stopped before getting there, overall the house is nice, just missing some essentials. I will say that Keena did respond promptly whenever I sent her a message."
