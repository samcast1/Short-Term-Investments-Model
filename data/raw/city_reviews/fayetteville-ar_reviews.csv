Stayed a few nights","This was a lovely place to stay for a weekend getaway. 15 minutes from Fayetteville fun, yet totally secluded and feels like you're in a much more isolated place. David and Alison were very responsive. This cabin is off grid, which aside from running a back up generator for a couple hours each night we stayed, we were very comfortable even with outdoor temps hitting 110 degrees. We were really impressed with the setup and couldn't believe we were in an off-grid cabin. Can't wait to stay here again!"

Helped us out with directions in the area, recommended a few trails, was very upfront with everything relating to the cabin. I will definitely be looking to stay the next time I come to NWA."

It is hidden away from the road so it feels private. Our favorite thing about it was that we were close to the Razorback Greenway for a bike ride, and we were able to walk to most places that we wanted. It was very relaxing and it was an easy process checking in and out."

I was afraid it wouldn’t get accepted in time, but it was very quick! I didn’t get in town until after dark, so it was a little tricky to find. The instructions helped a lot with pinpointing where the pull in was. It is a very small place, but it was perfect for what I was needing! The location was great! I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy walking and the nearby restaurants. The only “negative” was finding the key box! The instructions clearly stated where it’s at, but after dark it was very hard for me to find. I walked up and down with my phone light looking for it. It was on the other side of the rail and I just missed it since it was black. I wish there was a light or something to make it more noticeable. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to book again in the future!"

Definitely would stay at one of Nes' places again!!"

Stayed one night","The place was filthy &the host was terrible! From dirty floors/trashcans, hair in the shower, bugs on the bathroom mat, a filthy toilet &dried urine splatter all on the bathroom floor-which my sock got stuck in! I sent a msg to the host requesting a refund & he told me he could come over &clean (it was late at night &I was by myself and did not feel comfortable with that) or I could go down the cove to another place he’d been working from all day &he was “pretty sure the beds were made &everything was clean” I told him I’d prefer a refund when he told me he’d give me one ONLY IF I LEFT A 5STAR REVIEW. Which is extortion &against Airbnb policy. When I left he approached me while I was loading my luggage in my car & told me this had happened before in the past &he gave ppl a refund but then they still left him a bad review so I would have to take his word that I’d get my money back after I leave him a great review. I wouldn’t believe a single good review about this place!!"

Stayed one night","This place was super cute and comfortable! Looked just like the pictures and was super close to a bunch of good restaurants and bars. My only complaint was an Intoxicating strong smell of hard liquor, not sure if the people before me spilled a bottle or maybe it was the cleaning products? The wifi also wouldn’t work so I wasn’t able to watch TV or anything which kinda sucked. And the Keurig was broken. Other than that it was a cute place to stay!"

There were some pretty decent thunderstorms that rolled through in middle of the night that made for an interesting vibe, but the space itself was more than enough acting as my solo base camp. Nes was prompt with responses and check-in simple and stress free."

Their recommendations for dining were fantastic!
Most of all, we had a medical emergency that required one guest to push her flight to late afternoon and Gabe and Hayden accommodated her with a super late check out so that she could get the sleep she needed.
Outstanding hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","The Art House was so beautiful on the inside and felt very private, surrounded by a big yard and lots of mature trees. The finishes inside the house are lovely and things are designed tastefully. Honestly, I could have easily lived there and been comfortable. I especially liked the large claw foot soaking tub and the back porch fire pit. We played family games at both the dining table and outdoor back patio table. Everyone had their own sleeping space and the beds were super comfy.
We enjoyed the close proximity to good restaurants and shops, yet tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Having plenty of parking available was nice. You need to be able to take several stairs down to the house.
We had an issue/problem and Hayden and Gabe responded quickly and were very attentive, accommodating and resolved it above and beyond. We’d definitely return, if we get the chance."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at Gabe & Hayden's place. This was our 34th anniversary, and wanted a peaceful getaway. They are located on a shady street, where I enjoyed morning walks. This street didn't have a lot of traffic, yet it was so close to the things we were interested in seeing/doing. We decided to walk to a local grocery store, too, which was only about a 10-15 minute walk. We had thought to bring a cooler bag to bring items home in. The walk was especially nice due to the beautiful homes on Lafayette Street (picture New Orleans)! Saturday morning, we went to the Farmer's Market - a 5-minute drive (I think). This is one of the best Farmer's Markets I've experienced - 3 street musicians playing on the corners of the square! We bought fresh veggies to bring home and cook. Gabe & Hayden have a good amount of cookware, a nice gas stove, a darling ""vintage-like"" fridge, knives, oils, spices, vinegar. We brought our Foodi (Ninja's version of the Instapot) to use, too. But, we hardly needed it. The beds/bedding were super comfortable, the internet was FAST, the smart TV was available, and they have a very nice shower. In the room with the king-sized beds, I think they might have black-out curtains because the room was nice and dark. My husband and I both especially loved how they decorated their bathroom! A couple of other Fayetteville happenings we enjoyed were the Walton Arts Center to see a broadway musical and the public library is BIG with covered parking and a deli (also 5-10 minute drive). We would definitely enjoy a return trip here."

The home was very clean and decorated beautifully, and gave off a relaxing atmosphere. We enjoyed the different games available for the guests. It was almost like staying in a nature preserve as we saw deer and three fawns, with lots of trees surrounding the home. The home is on a quiet street which is great for taking walks. We will definitely book their home again when in Fayetteville."

A few standout features are a very comfy, King sized bed, Keurig w/ frother and complimentary coffee, and the nifty books they leave for guests to read. The book left on the living room coffee table had my wife and I spellbound.

It is welcoming and comfortable on a quiet street among the beautiful maple trees. A quiet street within walking distance to Dickson Street and the UofA and the Co-Op is a must. We will back!

We have a 3 year-old and a 1 year-old that are pretty busy. We had to do some easy baby proofing but the space was really great for kids! We could fit two pack in plays in one of the rooms. The kitchen had everything we needed and everything was so beautiful. A very beautiful interior design and this place smelled AMAZING! I sometimes worry about booking older homes but this place was perfectly updated and again smelled so good!

The interior is very stylish and is comfortable for two couples or a family. We stay in a lot of Airbnb’s, this one is one of our favorites now while coming to Fayetteville."

After arriving Ashley’s place I just wanted to stay and enjoy this amazing house by the architect Fay Jones! Beautiful house and had everything we needed! We all enjoyed it and appreciated every detail throughout. Especially the outside porch with all the trees and nature around it. So relaxing! The house is secluded but it’s just a couple of blocks to the university and the town. I couldn’t have stayed in a better place and we truly got the best experience of Fayetteville. It’s a hidden gem! Thank you Ashley for letting us stay and sharing your amazing house with us! We will definitely be back!!

Stayed one night","If you’re familiar with the award-winning architect Fay Jones, then you won’t need any convincing to stay at this beautifully restored mid-century modern. If you’re not, this is your chance to learn more and experience the best of the 1950s with all the conveniences of today (especially better bathrooms). Jones was an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright and the house is unique in reflecting Usonian (US) design characteristics. The property is expansive, with an upper terrace that stretches into the trees and offers a lovely view of city lights at night.
The home is very convenient to the University of Arkansas yet feels miles away. The McKees are delightful to work with and we had the good fortune to meet David McKee, a Jones’ apprentice and the force behind restoring Fay on Gray, and his lovely wife Alice. Would happily stay again, only longer!"

The back deck is so peaceful with a beautiful view of the tree canopy and gorgeous sunsets. The light changes throughout the day all over the house. We loved our time here! Ashley was very helpful and accessible whenever we had questions. Would highly recommend for art /
architecture buffs or anyone looking for a truly unique experience! The house is also well suited for mountain bikers with a basement area to securely store bikes and bike wash area outside."

We arrived late because there were accidents on the highway and the host was accomodating when we notified her of our late arrival by leaving the lights on for us. The location was great because it was close to everything we might need Including quaint coffee shops, parks, and trails. Our event was at 5pm so since we were so close to everything we got to check out much of the town before we had to go. The room had its own bathroom with a shower water temperature and presure were great. Overall it was 5 stars for us when we come back for a visit we would love to stay here again."

Walked to a Thai restaurant for dinner that was Very close by. Took a lovely walk in the park- which is about a minute or two from the house walking. Spring flowers everywhere. I will definitely come back should I need simple and cozy accommodation in a historic neighborhood.

We did not need full kitchen accommodations nor much room for sitting/relaxing. Melissa's neighborhood and home are gorgeous - old town Fayetteville, close to the university and downtown area. The room and bathroom were clean well equipped, just as advertised. It most definitely met our needs and expectations. I have one cautionary note, NOT a complaint! The walk from the street parking to the room is uphill, using beautiful stone steps. I'm 77 years old and had no trouble, except when I was carrying suitcases! Might want to take that in consideration depending on age and physical condition. If I get to return to Fayetteville I will definitely consider staying here again."

Easy to get in (yay) and I knew if I had a question, Melissa would have a helpful answer or solution. Here I felt I could do the work I needed to and rest while I was there. There is a water-filter pitcher which is nice to make tea using the kettle provided. I like the pretty view from the windows. I just discovered a little shoe tray that I was oblivious about the first time so I kept my tennis shoes there this time! The little writing table and chair is just the right size. And a faux fireplace which really is so charming even though I did not know how to use it, other than turning on the light feature. There is a little mini fridge if you have items you need to keep cool like beverages, yogurt or salad. The temperature of the space was just right. The shower is lovely and I had enough towels being tall and having longish hair, This is my second great time here :)"

Stayed a few nights","This place won't blow your mind by any means, but you can't beat it for the price. It's a small room ideal for one person, but two petite people could share it. The yard and neighborhood are gorgeous, and it's a fairly short distance from campus and Dickson St. If you require the utmost in elegance, modernity, and luxury, this probably isn't the place for you; however, if you aren't fussy and need a quick spot for a night or two, this is a great choice.
Best thing(s) about the place: price and easy check-in
Worst thing about the place: bed is pretty low to the ground and the walkway to the room is long and cobblestone style. If you have mobility issues, I wouldn't choose this place."

With all this said, I wish there had been a few more pictures to give me a better sense of where I was staying. I don’t mean to be so critical but this place could be so much more with a few cosmetic changes and upgrades."

There was a kettle, a microwave, mini fridge, shampoo and a comfy bed with fluffy pillows. The space from free of harsh chemical sprays/fracgrances (yay!). The lighting was calm and natural rather than too bright LEDs/florescents. The shower floor has beautiful crafted tilework that seems historic. Nice view of nature form the windows.
One challenge with the online map, it did not show me the correct house. The online map showed me the downhill house across the street To make sure you have the right location, you might want to get the longitude latitude coordinates and make sure your GPS shows up correctly and/or ask Melissa if the screen capture of the image on the map app.
I had travel delays and fortunately Melissa was able to be flexible. She is a gem. God bless this woman!"

Stayed one night","We stayed at Melissa's on a college visit to the University of Arkansas. It was perfect for the one night we were in town. The space is clean and quaint. A cute little cottagey room and bathroom with a pretty view. The bed was super comfy and we absolutely appreciated the bottle of filtered water to refill our hydroflasks. Melissa was so helpful when I couldn't figure out the door lock and gave us great suggestions for dinner places. We are keeping this bookmarked for any future visits to Fayetteville.
There are beautiful old stone steps and a path up to the door that we had a little trouble pulling our large suitcases up, so if you can, pack a small suitcase or just bring what you need for the night up to the room. I can't imagine how funny we looked to the neighbors trying to pull our giant suitcases up the stone steps. (6 colleges and 6 states in 14 days)."

I'm a walker, so it was nice to be fairly close to the center of town, but I would not necessarily recommend doing that ~1mi walk in June! Lol... super cute space, would stay here again!"

The instructions were clear on where to park and the pictures were exactly as the room looked. She is super centrally located. We brought microwave food with us but forgot plates. There were plates provided already. Also there was coffee, creamer, tea, filtered water, and hygiene items in case we needed it. The cheapest hotel was $68 and was pretty sketchy. This room was way cheaper and in a beautiful area. You can’t beat the value. No complaints at all."

The bed is comfy but very very squeaky. I found myself trying to move in calculated slow-motion so as not to wake my sleeping bed buddy. Her little private room would be a breeze though for someone traveling solo. I’d for sure try to stay
again when I need to drop my son off at UArk.
If you are very picky about shower water pressure like my husband is, be forewarned the water pressure is weak. But again, not a deal-breaker. Melissa provides body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and plenty of towels.
Melissa is quick to respond helpfully and we liked the little neighborhood just north of campus. Simple and easy!"

Stayed one night","This room has all the essentials and was worth the price that I paid; however, there were two main issues. The first issue was the pubic hair I found on the clean, folded washcloth. Fortunately I was able to find one without a pubic hair upon it, but upon further inspection the shower that I had not used also had hair in it. The main issue was being awoken at about nine am to the sound of a vacuum right outside the door that connected to the rest of the house, accompanied by loud voices. I understand this is her home, but she was fully aware there were people paying her to stay in that room. We were courteous and tried to keep the noise down as much as possible, and I feel that she should have done the same."

The home was beautiful, quiet, and clean. It was a lifesaver to have such a lovely safe landing spot after long hard days. We stayed there a week while we were dealing with some family urgencies and we are so appreciative of the awesome spot and proximity to everything!
Brandy and Jeremy were lovely to chat with and get to know, and we were lucky enough to enjoy their company one of the evenings. We will be renting this magic place when we are in town visiting our Dad, as much as we can!"

I rode a 48-mile loop that was 54/46 gravel/tarmac, and it was fun. There's more to ride depending on which way you turn. Good place if you're heading to the Chinkapin Hollow gravel grinder in October. Wedington or Hwy 16 has everything you will need if you turn east. Great space and location. I highly recommend."

It’s a short drive to get of the hustle and bustle of Fayetteville but still close to enjoy all the amenities. You can tell there was a lot of nice touches.

And there are so many flashing bits of lights welcoming us back at night. (My wife told me that they are fireflies. ) Early in the morning, when I look through the glass on the door, it is such a beautiful picture painted by nature. Thank you for providing this warm and wonderful place."

Nicholas was extremely responsive and easy going. I misunderstood how to lock the door and he was there in 15m or less. Absolutely great guy, and the door was totally my fault and wasn't any maintenance issue. The living space is great for working on the laptop or enjoying the spacious TV. The bed was comfortable and the arrival package thoughtful. Upon checking out I had a chance to speak with the co host and we had quite a bit in common association wise through Quartz! Truly a great place for an incredibly fair price. Being a short drive from Fayetteville, you are able to stay busy doing a multitude of activities without issue. Highly recommend these Hosts. So close to town yet so peaceful and restorative. 👍"

We arrived during bad weather but had no problems staying in because it was cozy and inviting. I really enjoyed the little creek in the back and how quiet and peaceful the surrounding area is. We had an SUV so getting up the mountain wasn't an issue, but can definately see how it could be with a smaller car. I would absolutely recommend staying and wish we could have stayed longer. Nick is very responsive and a very detailed oriented host, which is perfect. Thank you for a wonderful stay! It is a true gem and a beautiful property."

Stayed a few nights","My girlfriend and I stayed at Nicholas's AirBNB for three nights. Overall, we are happy with our choice; the apartment was cozy, meticulously clean (save for some old coffee grounds left in a French press by a previous guest who doesn't know how to dismantle it for cleaning 🙂), and Nicholas was excellent at communicating. The only reason I'm giving four stars rather than five is because of the driveway / access. It is very rough in some places and steep in others; an unusually heavy rainstorm during our visit flooded a low point in the driveway, which blocked the passage up to our food, clothing, and medicine. This forced us to park our car by the road and wade through shin-deep water and hike up the rest of the way. Obviously, the hosts have no control over the rain, but I feel the planned maintenance on the drive should be expedited to provide a better overall experience for guests. I would *highly* recommend this listing for anyone with a 4x4 or AWD vehicle!"

The unit is stocked with everything you could need for a short stay. It's close to everything we wanted to do but getting to and from the unit is a challenge given the steep gravel driveway. While I appreciate that pets were allowed, it wasn't the most pet friendly due to a lack of potty areas and the steep stairs with nails sticking out. Overall an enjoyable stay with some minor issues."

Communicating with Nicolas was great. He was responsive, accommodating and friendly. I enjoyed staying over so much, I ended up extending my stay."

With Airbnb hosts increasingly relying on third parties, this place was a breath of fresh air. Who knew there were still hosts that communicate personally, offer affordable prices, and invest in the property.
As far as the surroundings and space go, the land was gorgeous—the running stream was my favorite part. The inside was super stylish, cozy and functional…and the shower was AMAZING.
It was also just a 5 minute drive to stores and restaurants.
Overall this Airbnb experience went beyond my expectations. I will be back again!"

I do wish that the description of the driveway was a little more detailed, because while it is described as steep in too places and to be made of gravel, it is extremely difficult to drive in the dark and a bit of a worry for winter travel.
Would stay again, but perhaps with the understanding of the driveway being so secluded and rough and a different type of vehicle."

Fayettville is a really cool town....except I'm a UT grad. I did not wear my burnt orange. 😁 She gave excellent information on nearby things to do. Very specific instructions for parking and getting inside her place which was very helpful. Parking just outside the unit. No need to carry items up stairs or far from parking spot. Everything very convenient. Loved the lights coming on without needing to search for a light switch in some rooms. Very responsive host!

We loved everything, including the coffee bar, the comfy furniture, the easy check-in and the pristine cleanliness. If you need a place to stay in Fayetteville, choose the Nellie. It’s amazing!"

It is a on quiet street in walking distance of great tea, coffee, restaurants and local shopping. A highlight in this house was the coffee set up. Nespresso, Keurig, Filter and tea was also available. Although really good coffee is also within a 10 minute walk. Beds were very comfortable-tempur style. Linens were lovely. The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked. This house would host 6 guests very comfortably. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Doug, we loved your house so much, great location near the Square on a quiet street. My son and I moved my daughter into her first apartment at The University of Arkansas for her sophomore year and we all enjoyed our time at The Nellie before heading back to Houston.
The minute we walked in, we fell in love and noticed it was so clean, new, and smelled good!! The kitchen and living room decor was so cozy, modern, and pretty. The kitchen had every amenity we could need, how did you know we love waffles?! Bonus, the waffle iron, mix, and syrup are provided. The coffee bar was cute, and had everything we could need!! Morning Nespressos were the best! Wish we had more time to chill on the two patios!
Appreciated the washer and dryer and detergent to do a few loads. Upstairs bedrooms were cozy and comfortable. Loved the bathrooms with plenty of towels. We can’t wait to stay here again. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home! Woo Pig Sooie!"

Group trip","Harlin’s place is no doubt a bargain, especially for 5 people. Things were overall cleaned well, although under the bed was very dusty (I dropped something which forced me to look). Beds were creaky, and the fan in our bedroom made a banging noise when on because it seemed to not be well attached to the ceiling and was rattling around. The biggest issue was that the “sofa bed” isn’t a bed at all - just a sofa that *may* be long enough for your body and is quite hard. So it’s not the best option as a bed, despite what’s advertised. Also, this one’s on us, but make sure to check the building number before approaching a random door marked 4 lol"

Group trip","I enjoyed the stay & was so grateful at first at how fast the hosts responses were until I mentioned a leak from one of the showers.
No response for 3 days, until the afternoon before we left.
…That’s why reviews before mentioned only one shower, LOL, even though the listing shows 2 bathrooms.
It would have been nice to receive an apologetic response about the non functional shower or would have been nice to know ahead of time. I know it’s BS that they had barely gotten a notification 3 days later, after replying constantly within 5-10 minutes to previous messages.
Anyways, not bad for the price & location in Fayetteville."

Stayed a few nights","This condo is in a building of five - the end unit, with ground entry and parking very close in front. For a winter stay during the week, it was very quiet. The small kitchen is very workable with most equipment needed for simple meals. Two bedrooms are the same size with attached bathrooms (all bathrooms upstairs). The memory foam mattresses are newer and ours was medium firmness. All linens were very nice with extra pillows. Baths both have tub and shower and worked well. The TV was good. The heating was good, although the upstairs gets rather warm. The furniture was fairly comfortable. The area felt safe. This is a great place for a family or two couples. Coming from 49, our GPS’s final instruction was to turn onto Elm, which is behind the condo complex. So turn in drive before Elm that has two large “Bradford Place” community signs. Harlan was an excellent host – very accommodating, helpful, and responsive. Highly recommend!"

The host is very kind and very clear with instructions and expectations.

This was the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had. The kitchen was equipped with all of the utensils needed to cook a full meal. The house was clean, tidy, and well decorated. The beds were comfortable and the deck perfect for morning coffee and evening cocktails.
There was a hiccup at check-in. It was addressed immediately and it was smooth sailing from there.
We were there for graduation weekend, so paid a premium. I don’t fault the host. He’s charging what the market will bare. I will definitely book again."

The beds and pillows were great, there are throw blankets (which a lot of airbnbs don’t have), and games in the living room. Beautifully decorated home that was very walkable to our daughter’s sorority house, Dixon Street, and campus. Super close to Wilson Park (that is so pretty)! The dogwood and red bud trees were blooming - so lovely to look at in the back yard area and out the very large kitchen window."

Everything was top notch - the bedding, towels, kitchen equipment, all of it. The owners clearly put so much thought and care into this house. Justin was a great host and communicated very well.

Stayed a few nights","This is the most darling house and it felt like I was coming ‘home’ somehow! The owners have obviously put a lot of love, time and money into decorating it beautifully and giving homage to its Wilson Family Farmhouse roots, while having fun with darling touches of school spirit honoring the university! It all creates a warm and welcoming home to stay in while in Fayetteville.
Everything was very clean and the home had everything I needed (and more) for my stay. It was located in great proximity to restaurants, coffeehouses, shopping, a great park etc… I found I could drive or walk to my destinations, depending on what was needed. But that it was close enough to walk to places is such a nice feature!
The bed was incredibly comfortable and cozy and I found myself falling asleep quicker than I expected each night because I was so comfy!
The hosts were really great to work with and I would definitely recommend this home and look forward to renting it again the next time I’m in town!"

The character of this home is so adorable - we loved the history behind the house and all of the original touches and unique Razorback items in the home. We ABSOLUTELY will be back! Highly recommend this little gem for anyone headed to Fayetteville!"
