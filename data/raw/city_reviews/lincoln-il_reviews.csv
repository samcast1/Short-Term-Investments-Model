Stayed a few nights","The house was truly a home. Upon entering , you immediately felt at home. Comfortable furniture, fully equipped kitchen and spotless ! Beds were comfy. Bathroom was pristine, plenty of towels, soaps, etc and the washer & dryer. Super convenient. The special touch in the house was the numerous wood -art images that were perfectly displayed in every room . Darcy's father was the creative force that produced these amazing pieces of art. Neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. All in all, Darcy has provided a very cozy , comfortable and clean home that we will use again when we return for another family visit."

Group trip","This was one of my favorite places to stay. The house was amazing. Lots to do from ski-ball to arcade games. We even used the movie room, great sound!
The secret rooms were pretty neat a well. One of us actually slept under the stairs! LOL.. The garage was just as fun, with a game of pool.
One of the most thought up places ever. Was hard to leave the house that evening after check in.
The host Elizabeth was amazing! She answered every message, even though I was probably a pain. And she was super polite and welcoming.
I will definitely look to stay there again next year. Oh, we even spent some time out back relaxing! Great time all together!"

The highlights were that my son got the high score on Pac-Man, I won our family pool tournament and we watched five movies on the big screen! Elizabeth shines her light, not only through the rental, but through her communication and love of being the host. Her husband also helped get my daughter going on the ski ball. We are so grateful to God for a time in this rental."

Group trip","We rented this location to host my female relatives and (future) female in laws so they could finally meet and help me pick my wedding dress! The space was large enough for everyone to sleep comfortably (and the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable), get to know each other, and relax. It was absolutely perfect! Elizabeth was extremely responsive and helpful during our stay (nothing went wrong, but a package was delivered). My only suggestion is to add a rug at the bottom of the stairs on the main floor - the last step blends in with the main floor and more than one of us missed the last step multiple times lol."

Stayed with kids","This home is amazing!! We live in Springfield but 2 years ago decided to downsize for retirement. We rented this home for our family Christmas. It lacked NOTHING!!
It is so lovely and spotless!! There is so much space and so much to entertain every age!!
I have little grandkids and teenage grandkids. It was perfect for all ages!!
The arcade room was such a hit and the hideaway places for the little kids to crawl through and explore. I can’t forget the theater room!!!
We were so sad we only had one night. But we will book early for next year and make this a new family tradition!!
What Elizabeth and her family have here in this home is rare!! We travel a lot and have stayed in many Airbnb’s this one is on our list of the favorites!!! It’s even in our home town!!
You will not regret staying here!!"

The accommodations were just as described and I loved that there were 2 rooms with King beds to choose from. The sheets, bedspread, and pillows were luxurious and I also loved the noise machine supplied in the primary bedroom!
It was very clean and new. There were TVs in every room and lots of extra pillows, towels, blankets, etc.
The kitchen had everything I needed and the living space was super comfy. We used the gas fireplace as much as possible because it made the living room so cozy.
It's a big house! There are even tunnels for the kids and a really fun theater room and game room in the basement. Perfect for the whole family!
I would 100% stay here again! I didn't get to use the hot tub so we have to come back."

However being as we were embarking on a long road trip we weren’t prepared for the loud bar noise, car with loud muffler zooming up and down the street at 1:00 am, the building light that shined right in the bedroom, or the fast moving train that seemed to pass by often. It was too stimulating to sleep 🛌. That was the only reason I didn’t give this a 5 plus star review! Would have been great for a gals night on the town or a date night! Just didn’t get the restorative sleep we were hoping for."

Stayed a few nights","Charming 3-bedroom home that felt newly renovated. Located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac in a peaceful neighborhood.
Very clean, tidy and uncluttered. My two friends from high school and I chose this lodging for our annual ""Girls' Weekend"" and it did not disappoint. House smelled fresh and clean the day we checked in and every time we came back from being out exploring the area. We enjoyed the location right off historic Route 66 and took the opportunity to drive up to Atlanta to visit shops (such as a quirky and fun place called Midway 154) and the new American Giants Museum. Living room with the two long couches was the perfect place for these three ladies to hang out and talk for hours on end. Would recommend this lodging to anyone having a reason to visit Lincoln, IL or looking for lodging off historic Route 66."

Stayed with kids","Amy’s place was one of the cleanest and most functional short term rentals we’ve ever stayed in. After a long trip from Seattle-to-Chicago-to-Lincoln, it was so nice to walk into a “move-in ready” space where all we had to do was drag our bags in and put up our feet. The home is very well decorated with the right balance of “stuff” inside, which made it an inviting and comfortable place to stay for a long weekend. Live plants, modern cookbooks, and natural cleaning products were really nice touches. The backyard was fenced and equipped with a patio set, making it the perfect space to relax with a glass of wine while our two little kids played. The neighborhood was quiet, so going for a run or walk was easy. To top it off, Amy was an extremely responsive and gracious host. Little gestures like offering to pick up groceries before we got into town, complimentary drink cards to the local coffee shop, insight on local restaurants, and extended check out time all made our trip one to remember."

The actual layout and structure was so unique and beautiful. everything was super comfortable the bed the chairs. The bathroom was spacious. The kitchen had everything you can possibly need and more and there are little details all around that make this place amazing. They think of anything you may need. We stayed here for an early trial the next day so we arrived late at night. Parking was easy and getting in the house was straight forward. I was a little upset we didn’t get there earlier to enjoy the space more we will definitely be booking this again for just a weekend escape. It’s the smallest air bnb I’ve ever booked but definitely has the most amenities of most places. Love love this place definitely stay here they deserve the money we spend for sure."

Excellently designed and arranged with a comprehensive kitchen and quality appliances, despite the space limitations. Only 5 minutes from downtown Springfield, but when you're inside, you can swear you're in a cozy back woods cabin.
Steve was readily responsive to all our questions. All his communications and directions were clear and his guest book had useful information.
I cannot recommend a stay here highly enough. Should I return to Springfield, I hope to plan my trip around a stay in the Tiny Home Cabin."

The “tiny cabin” was quite roomy and open and I loved all the features that made it feel spacious. Plus every amenity one would need, even snacks! The loft would be fun for kids too. Or for an extra space for reading."

He recommended The Winner’s Circle and the ribeye sandwich was delicious! This cabin that felt like a perfect home away from home. It gave me some of my own space, and my teenager his own space after exploring. I hope we can return at some point in the future! I would definitely recommend this cabin to anyone!

This modest looking cottage on the outside is extremely well-thought out on the inside, impeccably clean, super comfortable, and is well-stocked with everything one needs. This property is like “Great Wolf Lodge” meets “Tiny Homes” with a beautifully decorated lake/hunting cabin feel. When you enter, you will be amazed with a beautiful downstairs bed and linens, a fully functional kitchen and cabinet space, Wi-Fi, TV and a super clean full bath. There is a comfy upstairs loft bedroom which further gives the property the cottage feel. Steve was a super communicator and if ever in Springfield, IL again, this will be our first place to reserve. The cottage is perfect for a couple or small family to enjoy. Thank you Steve for making your property available."

He had all kinds of complimentary snacks which we enjoyed as we relaxed and watched a movie at the end of a busy day. Everything was spotlessly clean. Steve provided all the extra amenities we could possibly need. All the thoughtfulness and attention to care did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. The cabin had a cozy woods feel. It was on a quiet street but was just minutes from the downtown area where we were sightseeing. Steve was available at all times for any need we had. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Springfield area!

Encountered a deer passing through later in the evening, she seemed unbothered by me and just mosied along. Also did have a few of the complimentary snacks since they were better than my own snacks I brought....

It through us off at first that there was not an official door for the toilet upstairs so make sure your traveling with people you like! lol.
I was so excited to have an Airbnb that had decent shades and at least one room you could sleep in if you wanted to.
Both bathrooms were very clean and very large with plenty of space to spread out.
Thanks for an amazing stay."

Bathroom was fantastic, he's probably going to demo ours to look and function as this one! He's 6'8"" and said the shower was the most roomy he's been in.

The only thing that may bother some guests is the lack of privacy for the master bedroom, it has no door, leaving it open to the rest of the house and there is no bathroom, toilet, or shower door either. This was definitely not a real issue for our family of 4, but may be for others. Overall totally worth the experience!"

The house is beautiful, the colors are on point, and the open concept was cozy and made it easy to keep an eye on the kids.
Also, our host was very helpful, responsive, and very accommodating.
I would definitely recommend staying here. Such a great find, and if you’re a fan of the movie or the show like we are, you’ll find yourself taking pictures of every nook and cranny to show off to your friends and family."

Very close to plenty of restaurants and shopping. If we come back to town for the Apple and Pork Festival we will definitely be staying here, if it's available, as it's far enough away to avoid all of the crowds but close enough to be just a few minutes from the festival. It will also be great for summer visits because it is so close to Clinton Lake. The hosts were really great too. They made sure we had everything we needed for a great stay!"

The hosts are warm, responsive and have put much time & thought into making this a truly beautiful & unique stay!

Group trip","We had a lovely stay at the cottage (spacious house actually). It was so adorable when you walked in, nicer than the pictures. Plenty of room to spread out and enjoy ourselves. Spacious bedrooms, huge living room and large dining area. Bathrooms were great. Loved the kitchen and the tile work. Easy to work with multiple people in the kitchen making meals. You can tell a lot of love and effort went into setting up the home. Had fun shopping and wine/beer tasting in the little downtown Elkhart area. You could also get ice cream! There are a couple of local eateries too. The bar in town serves fried chicken on Wednesday's and fish on Friday's plus a nice salad bar. Support the local businesses while staying at the relaxing cottage!"

Stayed a few nights","Such a beautiful bucolic setting! So quiet and peaceful that we were able to truly relax and reset ourselves for the next work week. Waking to the birdsong (and the occasional crowing of the farm’s rooster) was an absolute delight. We have missed the country and definitely got a dose of it, with the cows across the way in the pastures, the swallows darting in between the barns and the lovely sunsets across the fields and vineyards.
The porch was the perfect spot for our morning coffee and a glass of wine in the evening. The beds were comfortable, the living room furniture was as well and all the amenities were well thought out and made our stay a delight. Our hosts were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed meeting them both, as well as the farm’s lovable dog George.
There is no doubt that we will make the return trip from Chicago again many times over!"

Stayed with kids","The cottage is an absolute gem! My family chose to get together here and stay over a long weekend because it’s in the middle between where several of us live so the location is ideal. But the farm went well beyond our expectations. The pictures can’t convey how relaxing it is to stay here. We were able to both connect as a family and unplug from the world. The kids enjoyed watching the tractor in the field across from cottage, and everyone enjoyed the visit from the dog.
The front porch is a retreat unto itself. Everyone loved sitting on the porch. Even when it rained, it was a lovely place to gather.
The Elkhart General Store is also a place you should stop in and visit if you stay. So many different unique finds. We loved shopping there!
We would all love to come back some day!"

The Conn Family and everyone involved in the Elkhart Hill Farm that we interacted with couldn't have been more friendly and kind. There is so much to take in and explore that 6 days just wasn't enough. If you have the opportunity to stay here don't hesitate. I know we will be back again.

The house is thoughtfully decorated and very clean. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything needed to make and serve your meals. The owners are very generous with the property, allowing guests to roam and explore, as well as befriend their animals. Our favorites were Hero (a horse), Cupcake (a goat), Sis (a sheep), and best of all… Tom (a sweet, gentle Turkey). This whole trip had us feeling like we were existing in a beautifully written children’s novel. All three of us would certainly recommend visiting this magical place."

The owner gave us a lovely tour of the grounds and provided firewood which we used to make smores. The guest house was completely remodeled recently and is clean and modern. The farm is conveniently located near Springfield to check out the Lincoln historical sites.

Stayed with kids","The Elkhart Cottage on Old Gillett Farm (managed by Inn at 835) was a really amazing get-away from Chicago for our family of 4. Our kids (8 and 6) absolutely loved being so close to the horses, cows, chickens and the turkey. They even got to feed the horses carrots. And our hosts (Court and Karen) were kind enough to bring a two week old baby lamb down so the kids could see her. The cottage is jus a short drive from Springfield where we went during the days and were able to pack in some educational sites for our kids' spring break, such as seeing the state capital building, visiting the Lincoln Museum and the Illinois State Museum, as well as walking around Lincoln's old home and the Lincoln New Salem village and the Lincoln Memorial Gardens. We learned a lot about Lincoln! And Illinois! It was also relaxing for the grown-ups to sit on the porch with our morning coffee and to cook some nice family meals in the well-appointed kitchen. Would definitely recommend it! The hosts were so kind and gracious and the location was fabulous. We'll definitely book it again for future trips!"

Stayed a few nights",Court and his team were thoughtful and gracious hosts. Even though we (two couples) live only 15 miles away we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend getaway on Elkhart hill. The house has been recently remodeled and it was cozy and very clean. Court took time to show us the house when we checked in and gave us a brief history of the property. He even gave us a dozen fresh eggs from his free-range chickens. We very much enjoyed our country retreat on the hill!

This beautiful newly remodeled farm house has a lot of character and is situated in a quiet location on a large property. Cattle, horses, and chickens close by but on a short walk around the main residence and caretaker's house. We enjoyed quiet solitude that it afforded us. We plan on coming back in the spring to see how Court's newly planted vineyard and orchard comes along."

Court, the owner, was welcoming and responsive; the setting is peaceful and serene. The cottage has been impeccably refurbished and has plenty of space. We cooked meals in the well-appointed kitchen and used the grill in the back for a delicious steak dinner. We enjoyed seeing the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in nearby Springfield and ate lunch outside at a brew pub owned by Court. The porch was a pleasant spot for a glass of wine and conversation. You will not be disappointed!"

The lovely breezes and adorable white wicker furniture, and nightly cow parades make the porch a one of the best features of the cottage. The kitchen has retained much of its original charm, but has all top appliances and extra counter space. The antique claw foot tub has a view of the orchard, and the toilet has a separate closet. The furniture is comfortable and beautiful. The hosts provided us with produce from the garden, and couldn't have been more responsive. We also went to their beer garden in Springfield and loved it. Downtown Elkhart has 3 antique stores and provided some fun shopping and great finds."

The Conn family was wonderful and obviously cares very much about their guests. I'm looking forward to getting back to Elkhart and Springfield to check out their other properties.

This little cottage can be your home away from home. It is well off the beaten path, and provides a great view of the night sky. There is so little light pollution that I was able to take photos of the stars with my cell phone. They have just planted an orchard on one side, and a vineyard on the other. The horse pasture is right in the backyard. You can sit on the rear patio and watch their horses, or bring your own watch them all.
We are in love with this property!!!"

The caboose itself was a marvel. Wonderfully restored, it maintained its charming historic essence while providing all the modern comforts. It was spotlessly clean and well cared for.
What truly sets this place apart was the warmth and coziness. The small touches made a huge difference; cups of hot chocolate, candy canes and s’mores kits for the kids added a delightfully homey feel. Furthermore, the hosts were kind enough to throw a log on the indoor fireplace and set the outdoor fire pit as well.
All in all, our stay (just for a night) was simply wonderful. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique and cozy getaway."

The construction of the whole place is restored so well with the floors, metal, little cafe seats, and the wood slatted walls give a woodsy scent to the place. The bed and bedding was comfy, soft, clean, and on theme.
We came in town to see Andy Grammer at the Devon in Decatur and it's a nice drive. Just under 15 minutes. It stayed cool inside even with the temperatures being over 90°F. We loved all the little thoughts put into the stay with the campfire, guest parking sign, etc. We really enjoyed s'mores in the quiet night out back. It rained and had the best sound at night. The wind can get a little noisy, but luckily that didn't last long.
Our host was very nice and didn't have too many clean up requirements. I feel like this place would be especially nice in the fall with the campfire. We spotted a bunch of baby deer playing close by too."

We could tell thought went into every detail; they clearly are thinking of their guests and wanting to provide the best experience. From the fresh potted flowers beside the fire pit to the plush throw blanket, we loved all the unexpected “extras”. We were looking for a peaceful and unique place to relax and found it here!"

All the personal touches and cozy decor made for a truly memorable experience! Aaron was super helpful and accommodating. We had a romantic, quiet and unique quick getaway and enjoyed hiking in Allerton Park nearby."

Stayed one night","This caboose was very well redone to be very comfortable! We loved our stay and had everything we needed to disconnect from the outside world and connect with each other. We really enjoyed the thoughtfulness that was put into our stay. There were games we could play with each other, fun train related books to read, and we were greeted with a radio that we played during our stay. Overall it was tastefully done with modern conveniences that looked like they were from the 1960s when the caboose was in operation. Host was responsive and the place was better than the pictures and descriptions, which is saying a lot!"

Stayed a few nights","The thoughtful design of this place impressed me - for example efficient use of space in the bathroom and kitchen. The view from front windows is ag fields to the horizon - something you appreciate if you have any experience in Central Illinois. However, I was not anticipating the array of windmills occupying those fields! We had a little bit of road noise from adjecent Route 121. However, the ""hut"" was much more peaceful that the hotels we usually patronize in the Decatur area. Although located on the edge of Warrensburg, it feels like there is plenty of separation from the neighboring residences. We never needed to contact the owners. The only minor issue we had was attempting to understand the high tech thermostat. Although slow on the learning curve, we eventually figured it out. Despite its relatively rural location, the drive to Decatur only takes about 10 minutes. Overall, very comfortable and peaceful."

No problem leaving our bike on top of the car here at night. Nice and quiet (there was some occasional road noise with trucks going by, but that didn't bother us). We enjoyed sitting on the covered back deck on a rainy day watching the birds. While we were there, the internet was really slow, but Joe and Staci are working to fix it. If fast internet is important to you, you might want to inquire before you book."

Stayed about a week","Had to travel to area for a wedding so found Joe and Staci's place to be a pretty good fit for my needs. They have included everything one would pretty much need to cook, clean, bath, and even do laundry if one needed to. This was a nice gesture that you seldom find offered at many Airbnb stays. The bed was extremely comfortable so my back was appreciative of that. Many extra blankets were available as well as plenty of storage with extra things like a small fan and bathroom travel size offerings such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, and toothpaste. The kitchen had some nice quality pots and skillets and utensils to cook many things and had many glasses, cups, and plates to use as well. I found the table was useful to dine or work at and the TV was a decent size with most streaming options and local channels as well. The setting is pretty rural but the house does sit on Hwy 121 right between a change from 40 to 55 mph so at times semi trucks could be heard downshifting or upshifting pretty loudly but I mostly got used to that and the vehicle traffic subsides a lot during the sleeping hours. Communication was great before check-in and instructions were clear upon checkout. They did a nice job fixing up and older building and I think its a great value for a private Airbnb stay."

Such a pleasant space and thoughtfully designed within a cabin concept, form and function both in great order.
Joe and Staci were even kind to remove snow from the property during a winter storm!
Interior aesthetics are very appealing while the views out the window to the open prairie are an incredible bonus.
Full kitchen was updated and extremely useful. Dedicated laundry room.
The house does reside on a moderately busy state route with frequent heavy truck traffic. However, the road sounds did not affect my sleep.
Worthy of longterm residency. Additionally interesting to inhabit a modified quonset hut!"

The bed is super comfy. We were able to cook simple meals in the well appointed kitchen. This is a much better option than a hotel when we come to Lincoln to visit family. We’ll definitely be back’

Stayed a few nights","What an incredible restored property!!! I am born and raised in Lincoln, IL. Of course I had driven by the yellow stucco building throughout my life. I do know it fell into bad disrepair. What Terry did is truly spectacular. This building is historic and Terry lovingly restored it to its pristine original condition. The pictures absolutely do not do it justice. You have to see all the original woodwork and architectural features that he restored in person to truly appreciate what he did with the property. I was so comfortable staying there and I actually got a bit excited to walk through the door each day. The updated part of the renovation is also very tasteful. The modernized kitchen, bathrooms, etc. made it even more inviting. The bed was also very comfortable and the sheets and duvet were luxurious. I absolutely will be staying in this property again!!!"

Stayed one night","Review
This stylish prohibition-era inspired loft is more than your typical Air B&B experience. This location provides modern amenities and comforts with an added bit of interest and fun. Everything we needed for our stay was provided, the beds were comfortable and the TV was pre loaded with Netflix to keep our little ones entertained while we got situated. The place was clean, organized and easy to quickly settle into. Megan was very responsive and clear with instructions so there were no lingering questions or concerns as everything was provided up front.
We had 3 adults and three kids (7, 5 and 2), all slept comfortably. We did notice the baby gate below the stairs which was a nice consideration. The upstairs area slept my 5 and 7 year old with no problem. I am 6’1” and had to duck my head about an inch to walk around but watching a movie or playing poker at the table, you wouldn’t have to worry about that. The remainder of the space was open and very comfortable.
The loft is conveniently located within walking distance of a several food and drink options and a park/playground. Overnight parking is not allowed at curbside but there is a public lot around the corner. I was a little nervous about it at first but I awoke in the morning to find my van plus a handful of other cars there, all untouched. Overall, I felt the area was safe despite some of the surrounding buildings and homes being in disrepair. That said, there are several places like Lincoln’s Loft as well as Mama’s Arcade Cafe and The Guest House Coffee Shop which lead me to believe Lincoln may be on the cusp of re-emerging as a community deeply rooted in its own history while altogether writing a vibrant new chapter. I highly recommend."

It's also close to the park, IGA, ice cream shop, and a few bars. The apartment itself was nice - the photos are accurate, and it's spacious and airy. It was nice to have a few rooms + a loft so our baby could be in his own room and my mom could stay with us as well. It's worth noting that there's no bathtub (only really matters if you have a baby/kids like us). I really appreciate that Megan left a pack n play & high chair for us to use during our stay. She is a great communicator. We hope to come back and stay again!"

I wish this loft could be my apartment! It is so fun! It was super clean, everything we could have possibly needed while we were there. Plenty of blankets, pillows, towels, etc. Next time we are in town we are going to stay an extra day to explore the little town.
This loft is just incredible, and we will definitely be back to stay! Thanks for the great stay, Megan!"

We would definitely return and hope to do so. It was very conveniently located to everything you could want to get to downtown. Yes, the trains are loud, but we took our noise machines, and the white noise drowned it all out through the night. Washing my son's college laundry was a breeze in the nice machines as well."

Stayed one night","Great place. Clean, comfortable, greatly decorated and quite roomy. However, I did not notice under the “health and safety - you must also acknowledge” page that parking is off premises since the “what this place offers” stated “on premises” parking. You can not park in the front of the loft from 2am to 5am and have a 3-4 minute walk around the corner and down a block or so. Going into a strange town and having to walk to the loft after dark was not my cup of tea, especially with a rowdy bar with people walking around a short ways down."

It was nice to have drinks and be able to walk home. Very safe area too. We left to come home well before the sun came up and was happy to see police driving around checking on things. It was only my husband and I but you could have 8 to 10 people and never feel crowded. Megan was a great host and I cannot recommend this place enough!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is amazing! Communication was great during, before, and after the stay. The place was VERY clean which we appreciated during this time. There was plenty of room for our party of 10. Loved the location and it seemed the other suites would be a great place to stay as well. There was not enough silverware or plates for a group of 10 but that was not a problem for us sine we had most of our meals out (just want to mention in case there are parties looking as big as ours). This places has not been open long so there many be plans to add more place settings in the future. And we could not find as great of a place anywhere near this area for the price! I would recommend any of Megan's suites to anyone interested in seeing the Lincoln, Springfield area. We has the best time and many lifelong memories were made. Thank you Megan!"

After a long road trip with four teens, we appreciated the bottled waters in the fridge & access to a washer/dryer. Having two sitting spaces worked great with our teenagers while we visited with our friends. My kids loved the record player...so fun! We enjoyed dinner at Guzzardos, and breakfast at Flossie & Delena’s. Bought some fun things from the antique & Hallmark shops. Great town & everything within walking distance! If we had more time (and no kids) we would have checked out the fun pubs! Excellent communication & clear/easy instructions. We definitely plan to return when we visit our friends again, and visit the Lincoln museums next time. Thank you for going above & beyond for your guests!"

Group trip","We went to this property for a quick trip downstate to enjoy getting out of the city for a while. The property comfortably slept 7 adult men (with a few guys on couches). The space is even bigger than it looks on the listing and is in great condition. We enjoyed being able to walk to several bars and restaurants around the town square, and it is walking distance to a grocery store as well. Several of us arrived via Amtrak which also was walking distance to the property.
The train noise mentioned in the listing was not really noticeable to us. We all felt that the value was incredible for such a large space. The municipal (free) parking was nearby and easy to find as well. This was such a great getaway for a weekend. We also had the pleasure of meeting the host in-person and it was so fun to hear about the history of the town including some cool associations with Al Capone."

There is also two parks within walking distance for kids. There is train tracks super close that I was worried about, but never heard any at night (I’m a light sleeper and so is my little) , and any trains that went by in the day were barely noticed. Super neat place. We would definitely stay here again. Also Megan was super quick to reply and very helpful."
