Group trip","Our family had a wonderful experience at Lil’ Nauti. The hosts were incredibly kind and gave great instructions before our stay, during and at check out time.
The home was clean, welcoming and right by the water! The home is very well stocked. The extra towels, blankets and pillows were nice to have. Our family loved using the kayaks and rafts that were provided. We also enjoyed the fire pit in the evenings.
The location was great. Very close to restaurants, stores and golf courses.
Our family was hoping for a relaxing, comfortable week and that’s exactly what we got! We would recommend staying at Lil’ Nauti!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Lil Nauti! The cottage is clean and modern and located right on the waterfront. It's perfect for kayaking, floating around in inflatables, or just relaxing on the deck. We saw beautiful moonrises over the water at night. And there was a family of ducks who visited us every day. Such a delight!"

Brie was quick to reply to messages and answered questions that we had. The view of the water is incredible!! It was great being so close to the water but also very close to restaurants and stores. Our favorite place we went was The Social for ice cream. We hope to come back in the summer to enjoy the water more!

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay here and the location was so peaceful. It was great to be able to easily pull in the provided kayaks and sit in the chairs by the water to relax. The only downside was we didn't have any wifi and very spotty cellular. As this is a place to relax and unwind it wasn't a big deal, however, I had to finish some work items, so had to drive down the road a bit to get a connection.
I'd love to come back again and kayak through to the other lakes. The channel had a log down, so we didn't try to go through, but look forward to it in the future. Great location!! We were able to run into Angola just a few minutes away and eat at some great local places. We ran over to Pokagon State Park to hike which is also very close. So overall, great location to food, hiking and of course the kayaking at your doorstep. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","SECOND VISIT. LOVED IT! We enjoyed our visit here last year, and we were so happy to be able to come back. The location right on the lake is a wonderful vacation. We enjoyed the view of the lake from the back screened-in porch and had many meals there. We kayaked up to Little Bower Lake and Mud Lake. The little connections in between the lakes are beautiful. We also enjoyed kayaking upstream where we saw many cute turtles. We used the fire ring every day. The home is exactly as described. It’s clean, comfortable, and has great amenities. We never felt a need to leave. Tammy, Rex, and their daughters were all super helpful. We enjoyed catching up when they took us out on a boat ride. We hope we can return next year! Thanks!!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

Stayed a few nights","Tammy's place was just what we were looking for - a family cottage on a small lake. We had the chance to meet Tammy & her spouse (both are super friendly), and found out that the space was totally redone in the last few years, and it shows, with a new but lived-in sort of quality - welcoming, I would say. Along with multiple other reviews, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights",Everything about our stay was great. The house was great and a wonderful place for a weekend getaway. The screened in porch is a great feature to enjoy on the cool fall mornings while being able to look out over the lake. As the day warmed up being able to be out on the deck enjoying the same view and peaceful surroundings as the screened in porch made the days very enjoyable. The house is on a dead end road so there wasn't much traffic making for quiet nights and with very little light pollution in the area going out to enjoy the stars at night was a bonus. I would recommend anyone who wants to get away for a relaxing weekend check out this location.

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at the cabin. We were in town for a wedding in Angola and thought this would give us more room and a better view for the weekend. Met Tammy and Rex one night and they helped us start a bonfire and took us on a ride around the lake. Very nice people. The cabin was absolutely spotlessly clean and had little extras (tea, popcorn, bottled water) waiting for us. Well stocked kitchen, comfortable beds. Sunday morning went to downtown Pleasant Lake to see the steam trains. Would definitely consider for a future trip. 5/5."

The home was super clean and included helpful directions and great information about the area. The hosts very kindly accommodated a special request for us. We loved sitting on the screened in porch and even enjoyed a few meals there. The lake is a quiet, calm place to enjoy some kayaking, swimming or just sitting on the bench while enjoying the area and watching wildlife. We used the kayaks that the hosts provided and our own inflatable kayak. The lake activity was low, so the water was calm, not choppy like other larger lakes with more activity. We were often the only ones on the lake. We also explored the river connection that leads to other lakes. We would love to stay again!!!"

The deck off of the master bedroom is awesome as is the screened in deck off of the living room.
We had so much fun kayaking and enjoying the water......we are already planning on going back next June for sure and maybe even this fall if we can fit it in.
The hosts are the nicest people ever, we enjoyed meeting and chit chatting for a little while, communication was awesome and very timely.
Thank you Tammy for sharing your little slice of heaven with us!

The bathroom had all the towels you’d ever need and toiletries like shampoo/bath gel. The beds were very comfy and the view from the main bedroom overlooks the lake which was really nice. There is no wifi but there is a DVD player so we rented through Redbox. The fridge has filtered water so we didn’t have to worry about buying any extra drinking water. Tammy was nice enough to guide us through using the kayaks. I would definitely take advantage of them if the weather permits. There are multiple lakes to explore. Overall wonderful stay!

Stayed a few nights","Sisters stayed here mid-Sept and we really loved the quaint, lake setting. The deck overlooking the lake was wonderful, we used it a lot, the outside table was big enough to eat at or play games. It is very quiet on the lake. The large kitchen was very nice, and the rustic dining room table was great too. Beds were comfy & plenty of dressers. Entry & exit was flawless. Weather kept us from using kayaks more than a couple times. Walked the narrow road back & forth daily for a little exercise, can’t go too far in either direction. Went to Hartland Winery one day, was in beautiful setting. This is a great, quiet lake house, I would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Fantastic place to get away and enjoy incredible views, gorgeous wildlife, wonderful kayaking/boating/fishing, and the best hosts in Indiana! Tammy and Rex keep this modern, comfortable cottage spic and span and well-stocked with everything you'll need for a great stay. Beds are clean and comfortable, kitchen has all the basics, and you'll have plenty of firewood, charcoal and seating.
We had a perfect throwback vacation, and we were thankful for no wi-fi because it made us slow down for s'mores, reading in the sunshine, campfires, board games, morning coffee while gazing out at the lake, peaceful kayaking every day, hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill, and early-to-bed-early-to-rise so we didn't miss a moment.
Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention just how wonderful Tammy and Rex are. They greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the property, chatted with our boy, and went way above and beyond by taking us on a boat ride around the lake, then teaching us how to get their kayaks in and out of the water. Tammy even shared fresh veggies from her garden for our stay! Really impressive hospitality, and a perfect lake house vacation. We can't wait to come back."

I stayed for four nights by myself and it rained on and off most days but I still was able to very much enjoy my time there. I went kayaking four times and went for an 11-mile hike in nearby Pokagon State Park. The nearby city of Angola has many stores, restaurants, etc., and I spent some time there during the rainy times. I visited several boutiques (Libby’s, The Bent Fork, The Boathouse Boutique, and The Shabby Chic Boutique) and came across some great finds. I had breakfast one day at Little Chef’s Pancake House. The service was friendly and fast and the food was tasty. I also checked out a couple breweries (Chapman’s Brewing Company and Mad Anthony Lakeview Ale House). It was a nice balance of relaxing by the lake and also getting in some socializing with the locals. I would definitely stay here again!!!"

My only criticisms are that having the local tv channels and no internetonly was challenging for me, and the mattress on the master bed is extremely soft and was hard on my back. But overall, this is a really special place and I highly recommend it."

The house was amazingly clean, and the backyard/lake access was wonderful. In addition, the hosts provided some nice surprises like cookies on check in, charcoal and firestarters and firewood, current magazines, etc. I highly recommend, and we will certainly be going back in 2021 to relax and enjoy. Also, the kayaks/paddles/life jackets are in great shape, and the lake is perfect for kayaking and fishing."

We loved the big outdoor space for evening bonfires and lawn games, and we made good use of both the kayaks and the row boats. The hosts have a home next door, and it was a pleasure to meet them. Would recommend this listing whole-heartedly for folks looking for a quiet getaway. The kitchen was plenty large enough for us to bring all of our own groceries, but the nearby town of Angola, IN has plenty of grocery stores (as well as restaurants, mini golf, and a lovely state park)."

Stayed a few nights","Tammy's Long Lake cottage was a delightful home away from home! It was everything we needed and more! We have stayed a a few ABBs and this was much better than others! It was pristine clean, comfortable (even the beds), and so well thought out! She really has everything you need- even in the kitchen (spices, utencils, etc.). Because of that, we could have packed much lighter! The kayaks were great, and we had a blast on the lake,and going down the chain of lakes for a couple hours. It was so relaxing to have coffee on the porch and play catch in the back yard, have a bond fire at night and grill dinners.
The lake is not great for swimming because of the weeds off the shore a ways (you can deal with it) but the Pokagon state park is 15 mins away and has great beaches! We went and enjoyed ourselves in the sun two days there. We would definitely like to come back and stay here!"

We were able to use the kayaks and row boat to get out on the lake with the kids. The lake is peaceful and quiet and a great place to relax. The property is great because there is a lot of space for kids to play and the cottage is set back from the lake so we didn’t have to worry about our kids getting too close to the water. We used the grill to make some great meals and enjoyed the fire pit in the evenings. We look forward to making this a regular stay for years to come!"

The kids loved seeing all the wildlife (deer, turtles, herons, etc). We did day trips to the state parks for hikes and to the car museum. If you are looking for a quiet/low key get away, then this is the place.
Only issue we had was with the mosquitoes (as to be expected being by the water).

Stayed with kids","I would rate Tyler's home 10/10. I'm truly not sure why there are so many 4 star ratings (all saying everything was great). First off, the TV in the living room is GIANT, which isn't listed so that was a pleasant surprise to watch football. The home was clean, the bedding was soft, and the shower was good. (Despite being located on the lake, the water did not smell and the water pressure was great! I always look for reviews about water pressure so that's another plus.)
Another review mentioned the bunkbed room had no door in 2022, but there is now a door for complete privacy.
Tyler was very responsive and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again in the future and recommend this place to friends."

The foosball table was a source of great fun for our whole family. The kids thought it was a real treat to have a TV in their rooms. Even though “off season” for summer lake life, this was a great family getaway for us for the President’s Day weekend. It was warm enough one evening for us to grill out on the front porch. A super fun place to stay. If we are looking for another getaway we look forward to booking again in the summer! That way we can wait in line for the world famous donuts down the street! 🥰Thanks, Tyler!"

Someone came within 10 minutes to blow out the driveway and put down salt again. Tyler was an excellent host and eager to make sure our experience was enjoyable."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed Tyler’s bungalow. It was as described. The stairs are quite steep and a bit slippery so plan accordingly if stairs hard a challenge for someone in your group.
We were there in the winter to go tobogganing at Pokagon State Park. It was a good location for that. Not a ton of really close restaurants open in the winter but we enjoyed Curuso’s. We also ventured into Angola for Tom’s Donuts and Sutton’s Deli."

Stayed a few nights",Me and my partner stayed here a few days after Christmas. The scenery was wonderful. The couch was cozy and the amenities were nice. There were different types of mattresses when it came to firmness which is a big plus for me because I have back issues which make sleep finicky. Plenty of light in the morning. There is a beautiful kitchen which my partner made me a scrumptious dinner in. Foosball table was a nice touch. There is a Walmart and other shops about 15 min away. Tyler was nice enough to send over flowers for us! It was a great stay.

But it was perfect for our quick winter getaway. We are looking forward go back in the future.

Stayed a few nights","Cute lake house in great location. A few friends and I enjoyed a peaceful weekend retreat together at Hilltop Bungalow. We loved the feel of the place: great decor and amenities. The comfortable beds in 3 1/2 rooms gave us good sleep and space for alone time as needed. You can see the lake from the house, which is situated in a peaceful waterfront neighborhood. Very close to the corner restaurants where we enjoyed a seafood dinner and famous donuts. The house is 15 minutes from Pokagon State Park, which has gorgeous lake views and trails. When I contacted Tyler about a couple of issues (a smell coming from the pipes in the laundry room, a rocking toilet, and some bees in the house), he was very approachable and helpful. One thing to note: the bunk bedroom is more like a loft with no door, so keep that in mind for privacy. All in all it was a great little getaway and I’m glad Tyler shared his place. I would stay here again and may bring my family back for a weekend at some point."

We tried contacting the host, but got no response, so we had to contact airbnb support. After waiting outside for almost an hour, we finally got a response from the host and were able to get inside. The host was nice, and this was probably a fluke accident, but we wouldn't risk staying at an airbnb hosted by the same person again."

The A/C is a little wonky ... it's pumped into the living room (not Central Air) which does a good job of cooling off the Living Room and Kitchen. But, the Bedrooms were a little warm when we checked in. They did cool off as the night went on. Also, this is located next to a fairly busy street with a school across the way. It's pretty busy and noisy in the mornings. Otherwise, there are no complaints and I would stay here again."

I did have a problem with vehicle noise during the night and especially in the wee hours of the morning but had brought earplugs with me which worked very well to block out street noise. It's not a really busy street and I'm a light sleeper, so it didn't bother my roommates. I highly recommend it and Jonathan was very prompt to reply to questions. Thank you, Jonathan - I've already recommended it to my cousin and his wife."

Do bring earplugs if you’re a light sleeper as there is some noise from the adjacent road, but overall, I highly recommend a stay here. Lots of great little touches!"

I told my husband multiple times, when we come up to visit our son this is where we are going to try to stay every time! The coffee bar in the kitchen was a huge hit for me!!! The beds was very comfortable and we ended up turning the heat on late at night because it did get cold. We drove about 15 mins up the road into Michigan for dinner. My only complaint is there was no TV in the bedrooms, and no washer or dryer but for a one night stay that’s not a issue!! We will definitely stay again!!!"

The house was basically brand new construction and very tasteful done. We really didn’t get to spend much time there but it was an excellent way to relax after back to back games in some miserable weather. 100% would recommend and look forward to staying here if his journey crosses this way.

Stayed a few nights","The cottage is lovely and had a great view of the lake. Karon was extremely responsive to questions and provided accurate and helpful information. Check in was a breeze. Our ONLY ""issue"" is that there were several spider webs with spiders in them in various spots inside, and on Saturday morning while I was eating my breakfast I saw a live cockroach inside a glass on top of a cabinet next to the table.
Other than that the cottage was well appointed, and even had things in the kitchen I didn't think it would have (like a crockpot and full set of knives)."

Stayed a few nights","Such a cozy cottage! Comfortable beds, a very well-stocked kitchen, and lots of hooks to hang things on. We had a rainy weekend so we mostly stayed inside and cooked and watched movies, TV has Netflix and prime. We would like to come back in the warmer weather so that we can enjoy the patio and the sun porch. The porch is warm enough to use because the windows are covered in plastic during the cold months but it does disrupt the view. The state park is very close, be aware that there are no Ubers list or taxis in the area. Karon really went above and beyond, even sending me a beautiful bouquet of flowers since I had such a difficult travel day en route to my aunt's funeral, an incredibly kind host."

There is a beach nearby that you can walk to, it takes you through a short hiking trail (no pets allowed on the beach). We had a very short stay so we did not fully explore the lake and water activities available nearby...Waterfront Bistro and Tom’s Donuts were cute...

Stayed a few nights","We really liked our stay here on Lake George. The view from their home is got to be the best on the entire lake! Truly worth the cost of admission. If you want a million dollar view, this is your place. The space is clean and roomy; having ample room to spread out. The amenities are everything as described on the website.
Now, we learned something that might be a ""con"" for some people that I think is fair to share: Since you are connected to the upstairs family home, you can expect foot noise traffic while staying. While most people will likely not be affected by this, people who are seeking extreme quiet and solitude to relax might find it a little taxing. Also, you definitely will be smelling whatever the hosts are cooking for dinner each night. Again, just a function of how the spaces are connected.
In any event, we very much enjoyed our stay and really loved the area because there are lakes everywhere you turn. Plus a couple really good restaurants. Thank you."

The snacks and the bottled water were also a nice touch we rarely see at other air b and bs. I also appreciate the New Zealand theme, books and trivia since I am a LOR enthusiast and hope to visit their one day. Thank you Lori!"

Stayed a few nights","We've stayed here before and loved it! We rebooked for our anniversary and had a great time! Lori's place is cozy, peaceful and perfect for a quiet time away from our day to day routine! There is plenty to do in the area if you're wanting to go do stuff. The weather did not cooperate very well either time we stayed so we did not use the outdoor amenities, but they look very inviting! The view of Lake James is gorgeous and they have a beautiful sitting area to enjoy it. Private patio off the space and nice area for a bonfire! This space has everything you can imagine. Lori was super responsive and accommodated us well! This is a great space for a couple! We highly recommend it and will stay again!!"

Stayed a few nights","The Cozy Kiwi has the best view of Lake James. The sunsets were gorgeous from the patio facing the lake. I received detailed instructions before arrival. Check-in & check-out we’re easy.
The kitchen was well stocked. The bed is comfortable. There are plenty of extra pillows & blankets. I slept well each night. On top of all that, the hospitality was exceptional! I spent time with Lori & Patrick & enjoyed every minute of it. If you want privacy, they will give it to you. But I’m glad for the time that I had with them.
They made my birthday get-away a memorable experience. I enjoyed Pokagon State Park & a 2 hour boat tour with Corey (Lake James Tours).
I was also able to enjoy a Sea Plane Splash In at the State Park during my stay.
This is an outstanding place to stay!"

The suite, Cozy Kiwi, is cozy but also actually quite large and was more than perfect for my daughter and me. Lori has it stylishly decorated with local touches from her roots in New Zealand. We also had the chance to meet and briefly chat with her, and she was lovely and exceedingly welcoming. This Airbnb is without doubt a find."

The vanity area outside was a nice touch to put toiletries, etc. Also the little office nook was a nice secluded spot for someone to do work if needed.

Stayed one night","The Cozy Kiwi was ideal for our 30th wedding anniversary. Met Lori when we arrived. She was busy with a family gathering but took time to show us to our suite. Everything was very clean, updated and modern.....very cute decor and more room than expected. Bed was very comfortable. There was a full kitchen with bottled water in the refrigerator.....as well as breakfast sandwiches in the freezer and a basket of snacks which both turned out to be a relief when we needed some food for a low blood sugar situation......thankful we didn't need to go out to find a grocery or convenience store. The deck in front of the house looked out onto Lake James. It was very relaxing and fun to watch the boats along with a great sunset experience. We loved our stay and highly recommend the Cozy Kiwi should you find the need for a top tier AirBnB in northern Indiana as well as a friendly and responsive host."

Stayed a few nights","This is the best Airbnb we've ever encountered!
You expect a nice room, a comfy bed, and access to a private bath.
But this is an apartment! A fine gathering room/dining area, a spacious, well appointed bedroom with a very comfy bed, a bath and a small but very functional kitchen!
Our host, Lori, clearly understands that details make a great Airbnb experience into a truly outstanding one! Small appointments, a snack basket, cold water in the fridge, a Keurig with pods and real half and half, etc. Every detail was attended to.
When she saw us checking in, she came just to say hello and make sure we were in okay. We were happy to meet her and spent some time chatting, but, as she says in her listing, if we wanted to be off by ourselves, she'd be cool with that also.
Later, after our boat ride around Lake James (Lori can hook you up), we joined Lori and Patrick on the upper deck (there are three decks including one just outside the apartment door and exclusively ours - although we enjoyed chatting and joking with Lori and Patrick.
Five stars is not enough! We were celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary, We honeymooned on Lake James and wanted to reprise the experience. We had a fabulous honeymoon on Lake James 55 years ago and, thanks to Lori, we had a fabulous 55th anniversary!"

Stayed with kids","During our family’s move from NY to CA, Lori’s was our first stop. We were blown away by the incredible view. The space was clean, comfy, and functional for traveling as a family. Lori was an incredible host who was very willing to help us figure out where to park our large trailer and even offered a basket of toys for our kids. We were very lucky to find Lori’s place!"

Stayed with kids","The Cozy Kiwi is hands down the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The unit was super clean, well designed, and packed with unexpected extras. The time and thought that went into the tiny details (bedside chargers, proximity lights outside and in the hallways, snacks, a soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the shower, and so on) really shows - Lori really has gone above and way beyond the standard hospitality expected from an Airbnb. I really can't say enough good things about the Cozi Kiwi.
I stayed with my family and we explored Pokagon state park (which is also excellent) and the surrounding areas. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to experience the Tobbogan Run with the kids. Thanks, Lori!"

We checked ourselves in-and-out, which was nice because we ended up arriving a lot later than we originally planned.

The kitchen was well-arranged and gave us the ability to make breakfasts while there. A big plus was the Casper mattress; firm, yet the best night’s sleep for these two “old backs” Had a great conversation with them on Sun before leaving.

The beds, linens and towels were comfy. We also appreciated nice quality toilet paper & tissues. The two reclining sofas in the living room was a great hangout spot for conversation, tv watching and family time. We also spent time at the dining table for meals, snacks & late night card games; the extra folding chairs came in handy. The game room in the basement was great as bonus space. We were grateful for the pack n play and kid dishes. We didn't cook much, but there was plenty of dishes, platters and glassware for us. We spent lots of time on the beautiful patio & deck along with the yard under the shade trees. The dock was great for swimming & we also enjoyed the kayaks. The house is just a short drive to restaurants nearby. Jaime was a great host and communicated well with lots of tips and info. Definitely recommend!"

Palatial Master Suite with gorgeous view of the lake. Jaime knows the owner of Lake James Tour Co. personally and we highly recommend his tour. Fortunately, he was already on the lake; He picked us up right from the home's private dock!
Jaime is an outstanding host. Every aspect of our visit was planned flawlessly - her Guidebook to the house and area is the best we've ever seen.
The spring-fed lake is exceptionally clean. During the week, we had the lake nearly to ourselves. Morning cruises usually included a stop at the private slips of Tom's Donuts. There are several places to launch boats; The one directly across from the house is free and less-crowded than those in commercial areas.
There are very few short-term rental homes on this lake, so booking this hidden gem early is a must."

Hope others enjoy them as much as we did! I also suggest taking a nap in the sun room! Sooo peaceful! Richard was very responsive & informative! This is a hidden little gem. Richard and his family did a great thing here allowing others to enjoy their home. Please take good care of it!
We can’t wait to come back!"

Get up early and watch the sunrise either from the bedrooms with a lakeview, or from the large screen porch. Richard's place was perfect for our weekend getaway, and would be perfect for a family looking to relax and unwind."

Nice open floorplan was great for meal preparation and hanging out. There are 4 ample bedrooms and 2 bathrooms upstairs, which is a great layout. Highly recommend."

Some of us are from Michigan and some from Indiana. The open floor plan worked well for us and the kitchen was perfect for cooking and serving a holiday meal. The generous seating was nice for everyone to have a place. With 3 full bathrooms and 4 bedrooms, it was exactly what we needed. The lake is right there almost always in view. We really enjoyed our stay and made many new memories."

Stayed a few nights",This place was exceptional! We had a great mini-vacation / reunion here. The house is beautiful and allowed us to have our own bedrooms. We ate breakfast on the three-season porch overlooking the lake each morning. The kitchen had all the appliances we needed plus more and allowed us to sit around the island and chat while munching on snacks. We walked around the lake and neighborhood and enjoyed some kayaking. The host was very responsive to our questions. We would definitely come back again!

The firepit across the street was cozy, the outside sitting area behind the house by the lake very nice, and a large dining room table was perfect for all our meals and card games. We'd definitely recommend Richard and his place if you are looking for a low stress and comfortable place."

We spent a lot of time in the sunroom and on the patio enjoying the breathtaking view! The openness of the first floor, with the double sliding doors to the sunroom, gave us the perfect spot to hang out, spread out and relax. We visited Hartland Winery during our stay and had a wonderful time on their outdoor patio. I can't say enough wonderful things about Richard's place!"

It was cozy and homey and just invited you to come in and relax. The lake view was beautiful -even in waning winter. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. Richard was quick to respond to messages and made the whole process so easy. We would definitely stay again.

There is also plenty of seating and a very large dining table plus 4 seats at the kitchen island. Communication with Richard was immediate and the place was very clean.

Stayed with kids","You walk into this home and there is the lake, right there. What a view! As others have mentioned, the view from two upstairs bedrooms is also lovely.
We went right after Christmas so the open living room with gas fireplace/kitchen/dining area felt like home… and was decorated festively!
The kitchen was very well stocked with lots of pots/pans/baking pans/utensils etc etc. It was better stocked than my own!
There is a nice porch for summer use as well.
Lovely to have four bedrooms and our two granddaughters ( age 8 and 5) were so pleased to find toys/games to play with!
We went to Pokagon State Park for the Tobaggon Run and it was the highlight of the trip. But then it snowed and our Florida grandchildren loved it! Built a snowman in the yard and even had a snowball fight with granddad.
We loved this place and would definitely stay again. I am hoping to rent next fall with my girlfriends :)
Our host was very responsive and answered in a timely manner. This is definitely 5 stars or more ⭐️"
