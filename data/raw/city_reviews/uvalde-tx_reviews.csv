Stayed a few nights","Liia's place is a charming vintage gem set in a lovely walkable neighborhood with awesome trees. We had everything we needed except a garbage disposal in the kitchen sink & a dishwasher - but that's just part of the old world charm! AC units kept the place very comfortable. Liia is a great host. She answered all our questions and was easy to reach. The house is lovely, everything was clean and we really enjoyed our stay. Deer came to visit the spacious backyard in the evenings, and there were magical fireflies in a nearby park (we live in the arid Southwest and hadn't seen those in ages). Location is convenient to exploring the town. Parks, groceries, restaurants are all nearby."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay, we only had two issues with our stay but considering it’s an older home it’s understandable. The first being a security issue since a couple of windows were unable to be locked. The second being bugs, both dead and alive throughout the house. Other than that we enjoyed our stay, it was in a good location and was near everything. We had no issues with check-in or parking and the host was generous enough to leave a stocked medicine cabinet and complimentary drinks in the fridge. The rental did have lots of space and was decorated well."

Stayed over a week","This is a nice little place that is part of a duplex in a great area of town. It is decorated really cute with some vintage and Texas style decor. The kitchen is a little small and you could get the job done if you needed to cook, but is pretty minimal so we didn't utilize it too much. There is a nice yard to enjoy. The neighbor was quiet and friendly. It is a nice little gem for Uvalde and I'd happily stay here again. The office in the back of the house was a great spot to work remotely from and was surrounded by windows with lovely lighting. I saw deer several days in the back yard. Liia was great to work with."

We own 25 acres we use for hunting just down the rd and we even talked about booking this for when we come down during hunting season. The home was beautiful and the kids loved the play space everything was very clean simple and organized. It was close driving distance to

Stayed a few nights","My family and I were looking for a nice getaway to see the April eclipse. We wanted a peaceful and quiet place away from city nice and the crowds that would be coming to Texas. This house was perfect. We love the outdoors & the property surrounding the house had a wide variety of plant species including mountain laurel, prickly pear cactus, several flower species including bluebonnets, cedar & mesquite trees. The house was super clean & has 2 nice sized bedrooms, a very large living room space, a nice kitchen with modern appliances, great storage for lengthy stays if needed, a nice mudroom that houses a washer & dryer if needed & a spacious loft area upstairs. The bathroom was just right with a tile accented tub/shower. I spent a lot of time walking the grounds around the house, and on the large half wrap around porch in the mornings with my coffee listening to the birds. I'll definitely be back for another stay. Highly recommended for a nice quiet getaway with real Texas views."

Only thing I’d say is that if you’re planning on using the full amount of beds that are listed as bed in the Airbnb you might want to reconsider or plan on getting air mattresses, given that two of the “twin beds” are made from fold out green velvet chairs and they definitely don’t work as a bed unless you have something under each end of them to prop them up to make it flat."

We’d like to visit again when the weather is cooler so we can enjoy the deck. The only reason for a 4 star on the cleanliness was the floor. We don’t wear shoes indoors and we were consistently wiping our feet off. Otherwise, a great stay and the water pressure is AMAZING! Wish I had that pressure at home. Would definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Review is for Krystyn's Continental Loft in Uvalde, TX
Traveled with two associates on business. This was a fabulous place to stay. Very, very clean, comfortable and spacious. Would give 10 stars for the value and Krystyn's hospitality. We were traveling on business and the loft fully met our needs. Krystyn communicated very well with our small group was wonderful to work with. The community memorials in town were very heartfelt, our sympathies go out to this community and the families of those involved in the recent tragic event. Wonderful community."

Group trip","I booked four rooms with Krystyn at the Benson Guest House, and also the loft across the street. All four accommodations were spectacular, according to my guests who stayed there. They had all come in from out of town, from Houston, Denver, and San Antonio, and all fell in love. All also said they would want to stay again. The ambiance, the comfy beds, and the peace and quiet were all things they pointed out. Krystyn was also clear in her instructions in terms of checking in and out, and was very friendly in her correspondence. If you have a larger party, try renting the loft. It's spacious, and the privacy/outdoor patio is extremely convenient. The location in charming downtown Uvalde was also a huge bonus. We will be booking/staying here in the near- and long-term future."

There aren’t many options in this area to stay so it was nice to stay at this location. krystyn made directions simple and pretty straight forward. One thing to recommend is the twin chairs that turn into a bed were a little bit tough to get comfy in but maybe if there is family in the area you can just inflate an air mattress and it works just as great!

It was a straight shot to float the river. We wish we had time to walk around the local boutiques. The master bedroom bed is super firm. Sounded like there was some light construction outside our window. Just a heads up on those two things. In case you like fluffy beds and absolute peace and quiet. Plenty of fast food restaurants, HEB grocery store, Walgreens, etc within 5 minutes or less. Our group consisted of 4 adults and 1 child. Everyone was comfortable. Would stay again!"

There’s a TV in every room if you need to relax after a long day on the river, and the AC works great and is completely silent. We originally booked here at the loft, but changed to the Benson Guest House because a displaced family still needed the loft. We didn’t mind, and Krystyn was still more than accommodating and gave us a gift card for some of the local restaurants."

Stayed a few nights","Julie is a great host, especially she will provide you the things you need during your vacation plans in Uvalde Texas.
4.5 out of 5 stars!
Pros:
it has everything you need to cook, sit and relax, go online on your devices, use the bathroom especially has well, it has a heater and air condition for summer in winter, a pool & jacuzzi, & it has a memory foam bed to relax and sleep.
Cons:
The internet Wi-Fi is kind of lacking, especially it's not very strong to reach the bedroom for a long period of time, while you're online on your devices, but I hope Julie in the future can fix these issue, especially to add a Wi-Fi box router to make sure it connects to the bedroom and everywhere else in the backyard.
I wish the toilet and shower will be a little bit more cleaner, especially for the hot water to last a bit much more way longer as well.
& it would be nice to have a smart TV in the room while you're on online streaming shows.
All in all I had a very good time at Julie place! 🙂😉👍"

Stayed a few nights","After so many great reviews, I looked forward to staying at the Tiny Casita. Their Golden was a friendly dog and well trained not to jump on people. The first night the dog kept me awake barking. He was left out all night. I emailed Julie the next day and she apologized. The dog was inside the second night and I had a great sound sleep. The third and last night of my stay, the dog was left out again. At 12:45 AM I was awakened from a sound sleep with the barking. At 2:15 AM, again, the barking started. Both times, I had to go to the door and command him to stop. I am an exhausted and very disappointed guest."

Stayed one night","What a wonderful retreat in Uvalde. When we arrived at the casita, the hosts left a heater on in anticipation of our arrival - it was such a welcoming gesture, especially arriving on an unnaturally cool day in Uvalde and after a very long drive. We had a wonderful sleep on the super comfortable bed. However, what stands out the most is the friendliness of the host, Julie. She was super responsive, kind and just an overall great human. It is obvious that this casita is owned by a lovely young family. It is a cozy space, perfect for 1-2 people. It is small, but comfortable and great for a short stay."

It might be barebones for now but had everything I needed for my one night stay. Julie also provided a great dinner recommendation on short notice for that night!

He also has other rentals adjacent to this guesthouse and I would say they are worth the stay. If you’re looking for a unique, thoughtful, and safe stay in Uvalde or surrounding area, I recommend booking with Marco."

We arrived late and looked into a place last minute, his place was available and even though it was late into the night he responded promptly. When we arrived, I needed a assistance and he again replied and offered assistance over the phone. It was a quiet and private area to stay at. I have to add that I was not comfortable with considering renting an Airbnb due to traveling with my 18 month old grandson. Once there it was clear that he would be comfortable as well to play in the cabin with his toys without me worried about him knocking something over, which was of great relief. We will consider staying there again, because of our peaceful experience."

Stayed with a pet","We didn’t get to stay at this place as it was somehow double-booked. It was quite disappointing as we made a 4+ hr drive to get there and found out someone else was already staying there. Marco did however give us the option of staying in another one of his properties, which was in the back but it was a lot smaller (not a full kitchen/oven, much smaller refrigerator, water seeped in when it rained that night), than what we had originally booked. The least he could do was to reimburse after the experience we had, but we haven’t heard anything yet."

Stayed a few nights","When we arrived we were greeted by Marco who was not only very welcoming and hospitable, but also eager to ensure we were comfortable from the get go. We had a great chat. While many we've met thru AirBnB have gotten an attitude that they are doing us a favor by providing lodging, Marco and Leigh were polar opposite. They really made us feel that we were true guests and immediate friends. Read the reviews. Often it's about the facilities. Marco's and Leigh's reviews focus on their kindness. It made the stay a cozy one - like you're visiting old friends - and yet, they give you the privacy your looking for.
At this time, Marco and Leigh have two units available on AirBnB. While we had booked one, Marco invited us to view the other in case we ever come back and 'our' unit was booked. Both are very special and different. Our unit is a man cave but cozy for the girls too. It was well arranged and clean and is equipped with everything you need. It was important for us to have a good Internet connection for Zoom meetings; they went smoothly.
The other unit - I don't want to give too much away - is a newly remodeled comfortable get away. Which ever is available or which every you choose, you will definitely find it relaxing and a home away from home.
Thanks to Marco and Leigh for your kindness and generosity!!
Happy Travels"

Stayed a few nights","Marco saved us when we had to go to Batesville from Houston for Uncle’s funeral. Hotel were booked, but miraculously, he had a cancellation, so we got to stay at his place! Fun place to look at-had everything we needed-even a little bottle of hairspray-I left without packing mine and needed some due to wind at gravesite. Never had that sample at any of the airbnbs we’ve stayed in! Just a thoughtful touch. Also, full length mirror on door. When you’re in small towns for weddings or funerals, you’d like to see the entire outfit! Those special touches were more than we’ve seen at the other places we’ve stayed-even one where we stayed for stepson’s wedding didn’t have full length mirror. If anyone ever runs into that, Walmart has cheap ones! Had to get in Fburg, but Marco and Leigh thought of all that! Iron, board and hairdryer also. Thanks for all the special touches, especially on such an emotional weekend. We would always recommend to friends going in that direction!"

Stayed with kids","Just spent 3 days at the Gonzalez Guesthouse with my 9 yr old and loved it. We booked the trip very short notice (the night before) to tube the Frio River for the first time and explore the surrounding area. The property was easy to find if you follow Marco’s directions once you get off 83. I would simplify them even more to R on Elm, L on Homestead, R on Uvalde Oaks Drive, and the guesthouse is on the L #303. Just look for the big yellow Harley Davidson sign. You can’t miss it. Marco loves his bikes! The owners live right next door to the guesthouse. We were greeted upon arrival by Marco’s lovely wife Leigh and their adorable little dog Cheeky. To call Leigh warm and accommodating would be the understatement of the year. It’s people like Marco and Leigh that give Airbnb a good name. The guesthouse is as cool, funky and eclectic as it looks in the photos. The decor has something for everyone. My kiddo had great fun asking “What’s your favorite decoration/sign?” each day. The beds are very comfortable. We both slept peacefully all three nights. The A/C works great plus there’s a ceiling fan above the beds. The combo kept us cool for our entire stay. The shower works great too. Everything you need is provided but if you could think of anything they’ve missed, they’d get it for you pronto anyway. Marco and Leigh made great recommendations for local dining which I’ll list at the end, and Leigh helped prepare us for tubing the Frio as first-timers. We used Andy’s on the River, who provide a shuttle service to pick you up once you’re done. We tubed both days and it was wonderful - sunscreen is a must and needs to be reapplied often for protection as you’re out there for 3 hours or more. It’s an easy 25 minute drive from the guesthouse to the river. By the time we left we had made friends for life of Marco and Leigh. They are great hosts and their hospitality and easy going south Texas nature is a winning combo. My kiddo got so attached to Leigh and Cheeky that she shed tears for 30 minutes once we hit the road and made me promise we’ll be back. We will 😉
The following restaurants were all suggested by Marco and Leigh and are excellent.
Julio’s Grill for breakfast. Uvalde.
Broadway 830 Artisan Pizza. Uvalde.
Hippie Chicks River Shack for burgers, chicken etc on the river. Concan.
The Frio Float for ice cream, shakes, house made chocolate, & gifts. Concan.
Enjoy!"

There are 3 buildings on the beautiful property and this one is the one on the right. Coded doorknob. It is a charming and spacious place. Good AC, fridge and stove, giant TV. Nice."

Stayed a few nights","The cabin was great, it was perfect for what we needed and served us well! Convenient location, fairly priced and the hosts were very kind to accommodate our third (small) dog. The space was very clean, cozy and safe. The only complaint to be had was that we arrived to a very hot and muggy cabin. (The AC unit was turned off.) After a long morning of traveling, we were really looking forward to relaxing and maybe getting cleaned up to go out for dinner. It took hours for the cabin to cool off and those plans were out the window. Overall, it was a great experience."

Stayed one night","Gonzales’s Guesthouse is the type of AirBnB I hate to review because I want it to be available next time I’m in Uvalde, TX. It’s probably one of the best AirBnB experiences I’ve ever had. Leigh was there to greet us and show us the ropes. We are birders and we’re allowed to bird anywhere on their property. The guesthouse was very clean, spacious, and had everything you would need. The room is huge and very comfortable. Had a great nights
sleep in the most comfortable bed. We just stayed one night, but next time we will definitely be staying longer. Don’t hesitate to book this GREAT place."

We would stay there again. Probably the only issue they we had particularly was walking our dog. The road was busy and filled with things that interested our dog so we had a hard time getting her to potty. But we worked that out and she (and we) were fine. The place had been cleaned spotlessly and we settled in quickly. Plenty of hot water and heat (we were there in the winter)."

We almost always stay in Airbnb's when we are staying somewhere for a week or more. With the current situation we decided we would rather be in a private property by ourselves rather than a public hotel. Marco's place with just what we needed and would have worked fine for more than a couple of nights, although that's all we needed this time. It had a full kitchen, Netflix and some nice outdoor area for Chief to stretch his leg's. Marco helped us out during check in and was very helpful during our stay. We will stay there again when we come back...

Stayed a few nights","This cabin was a lot of fun to stay in. This was our first experience using Air BnB. We flew in to Houston from from Ohio to do some stargazing and needed a place to stay near to a dark sky sanctuary. This was the perfect spot and even did some stargazing in their back yard. We stayed 2 days and enjoyed the rustic and eclectic cabin that has such a history. It was just a few minutes from the Uvalde complete with a Walmart and lots of places to eat and shop in case you forgot something along the way. Driving in from Houston, we wondered about cell service in this rural part of town, but T-Mobile did not disappoint. We surprisingly had strong 4G cell service all along the way from Houston and for miles around, even in the dark sky sanctuary. The host provided several extra touches including a history of the cabin, the use of some directors chairs and anything else we overlooked or needed. Over the top! The host was very welcoming and friendly too and loved their friendly dogs too! We would definitely return and recommend this place for those wanting a different experience."

Stayed one night","My friend and I stayed here for one night before driving to Lost Maples park. It was difficult to find the cabin in the dark because the address isn't correct on Google Maps, so try to check in during the day if you can. The guesthouse was adorable and the heat was on when we got there (it was freezing outside!). Comfy beds, small but usable kitchen, and cute furniture and decor. Our car was extremely low on gas, and the owners were kind enough to give us a bit to get on the road in the morning. We'd definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Marco’s home is the best place anywhere around Uvalde to either get a jump to the rivers or just to sit back and watch the sun go down (we did both). If you’re looking for a peaceful, homey, and stylish cabin to rest in between river trips, this is the place! It had all the comforts we needed, and the way it was styled was so cool that we just enjoyed sitting around inside or lounging on the patio looking out at the goats. It’s close enough to town that you can drive right in to get what you need, but Marco’s place is far enough out that you’ll fit right in with the south Texas countryside. He and his family were a pleasure to meet as well, and anyone would be lucky to have them as hosts and as friends. Until next time amigo!"

They gave us fresh eggs- a super welcoming touch- and made sure we had everything we needed. Our pups loved having room to roam. Mornings were wonderful with lots of dove calls - felt like being in the middle of nowhere but HEB is just down the road. We loved that the cabin was made from all reclaimed and repurposed materials. We highly recommend staying with them and hope to return again in the fall!

All the listed amenities that we needed and tried worked flawlessly. It is very close to the walkable part of downtown Uvalde. It was close to the restaurants in town that we enjoy, the local H-E-B grocery store, and other key functions of day-to-day living. Neighborhood was safe and quiet. This is exactly what my bride and I were looking for in a booking for a couple of days to do some photography in the local area. And it would have been great for a longer stay. We visit Uvalde nearly yearly. I will be heartbroken if this property is not available when we come back next year."

We were grateful to be able to bring our ESA dog with us. The cottage was conveniently located close to the historic area and the main street, which had plenty of restaurants and shops. Although the cottage was situated in an alley near older homes, it was a peaceful and pleasant place to stay. However, the bathtub was outdated. There were a couple of minor issues such as a strong Febreze smell and a lack of toiletries in the shower, but overall, we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Place was cute n very peaceful.. tho check out time was not communicated right , the email said 11am & book in house said 10am ..i never looked at book .. anyways i had the cleaning personal knock on door to notify me that check out time was at 10am and it was around 10:20 or so ..so she proceeded to tell me she needs to come in and start the laundry cause she got other homes to clean.. I was I guess .. I felt rushed to leave ..
Then after i left i thought why did i let her in i dont know who she is she didn't give me her name and i didn't even ask it happened so fast .. anyways i was out by 11am and i would definitely stay again.. just know for next time check out time is 10am .. thank u.."

I didn't even have to get in contact with Lilly because everything from my arrival to my departure was so seamless. The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe. It's in the center of everything Uvalde. This was my first time visiting the town and I will definitely be back. When I return, I hope this place is available. It made me feel like I was home even though I wasn't. Thank you for being such a thoughtful host, Lilly. We'll surely be back!"

Stayed one night","The place was inspiring. We loved the layout design and that ithad everything that we needed in our stay. More than some of the hotels that we’ve stayed in. Thank you for the detailed instructions on the keypad.
We did unplug the scent. It was a bit too strong for us but we put it back before we left.
The temp display on the AC unit was a little bright at night. We didn’t find the button to turn the light off until the next morning. Maybe add that to the checkin text to your next guests."

The area was peaceful and quiet, very important to get a good night sleep. The apartment was so clean and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was well stocked and the kitchen had everything we needed to make our quick breakfast in the morning. The towels were so nice and soft and the entire apartment smelled clean and fresh. The living room and kitchen was a great place for us to entertain our friends in between the events we attended. Thank you for making our stay in Uvalde very pleasurable, this was way much better than staying in a hotel. I hope your ""A Time Away"" apartment will be available next time we visit friends in Uvalde. Great job with the place!"

The only thing to note is that the home lacks some basic kitchen essentials like seasonings and coffee (which I believe was advertised in the listing but I could be wrong) but that wasn’t a huge deal and we were happy to go get our own supplies for that and we would still come back for sure!"

As someone preparing for an exam, I couldn't have asked for a better place to concentrate and focus. The country loft itself was beautifully decorated and had everything we needed and more. We had a great time feeding carrots to the horses and getting up close with the goats and longhorn cows. It was exactly what we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable visit. We are excited to come back and bring our kids along. We were fortunate to have Mike and Jenny as our hosts. Not only did they provide a wonderful accommodation, but they also went above and beyond to assist us when we encountered car trouble. Their genuine hospitality and willingness to help made our experience even more memorable. We are truly grateful for their kindness and highly recommend staying at their Airbnb."

I have been working in Texas for sometime and my girlfriend flew from New Jersey to visit me. We stayed here to try to relax and take our minds away from work. I can’t remember the last time I was able to sleep as good as I did here, definitely grateful for being able to spend our time here. We purchased groceries our first day in Uvalde and basically grilled food, there was really no need to eat out. There is a binder in the living room with instructions and places to eat as well as things to do. There’s also board games in the closet and even a massage chair in the bedroom. Overall, this place is amazing if you are looking for relaxation away from the city as well as privacy."

Upon arrival Mike met with me in front with a big ol howdy (Texan way of saying welcome). He took the time to make sure that I had a pleasant travel and showed me around their beautiful house. When I say that they have gone above and beyond to make everyone feel comfortable and at home they have covered everything! The pool was wonderful to relax in and enjoy sitting outside and take in the country view and sounds. The bed was very comfortable and there is even a massage chair that helped me relax. Definitely the best host and home for a getaway. They are definitely an Angel sent from GOD. Thank y’all again!

Every time I walked in I thought to myself, “This place smells great!” Everything was so clean and organized with new electronics and modern/updated rooms. The massage chair was amazing! The shower was unbelievable! The bed was very comfortable with the softest sheets. This place has everything you need. There were carrots in the fridge to feed the horses. The pool was available. We really liked that it was private, but never felt neglected. The weather was rough one night. As Mike was cleaning up the next day, he made sure to check on us. He always made us feel at home! My best experience with Air-bnb! Highly recommended and I will stay here again when in the area."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at The Country Loft hosted by Mike & Jenny for our 1 year anniversary and it was fabulous! There spot was so peaceful in addition to Mike & Jenny being the most incredible hosts. I can’t say there’s much locally that was impressive for restaurants so we just shopped in town at the grocery store and cooked at our Country Loft that had everything we needed. The pool is just right for 2 people, my husband’s knees are really bad but he could manage the stairs just fine; they are solid with a good railing and wide. I love the shower, wish that could have come home with us. The farm animals were rockstars and every detail was thought of. FYI - from this spot you can drive 30 to 45 min in just about any direction and find an awesome swimming hole. This was just what we needed for some R&R and I couldn’t brag on Mike & Jenny’s and their Country Loft enough!!"

Uvalde is a centralized location to lots of places like San Antonio and Fredericksburg. I won’t stay anywhere else. Mike and Jenny have an awesome spot. Fully Stocked. Pool. Horses & Goats. Very nice and comfortable. Feels like home away from home.

It was beautiful, peaceful and having the horses out the back door was a delight. Everything in the cottage was pristine and well-tended and Mike and Jenny were so helpful. Cannot recommend enough for anyone wanting a calming escape in the Uvalde area."

The house has all of the necessary appliances one would need for a great meal, along with dual AC which keeps the house very cool, even on the hottest days. The bathroom appears newly remodeled and everything in the home is upscale."

Stayed about a week","The best Airbnb I have stayed in to date. It will be hard to top this one for me. I am coming from a large city, so I started getting concerned because it is in a rural area outside a small town. I got over that rather quickly when I saw how beautiful the scenery is. When I turned into the drive (more like private road to the house) an expanse of hills and green farmland. The home was midway up a hill and Mike greeted me. He and his wife are genuine folks. They made me feel right at home. Mike had me park in the covered parking and gave me a quick tour. The place is a true working farm/ranch. I met their ponies and heard of goats (cuteness overload by the way). The guest house by the pool are the accommodations and top notch, and you have a private patio with access to watch and hang out with the ponies. Most Airbnb’s charge high cleaning fee’s which can double the price per night, and yet I still have to clean them myself after check in. Not to mention they barely want to leave you any clean towels. Both are my biggest complaints of Airbnb. You don’t have to worry about that here. The loft was immaculate and beautifully decorated. By far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The upstairs loft is the bedroom. Very large space with a breathtaking view. Great place to watch the sunset.. What better than to watch ponies during a beautiful sunset. So serene. You also have a pool
right outside your door. If you need an escape from the hectic rat race of life, reconnect with yourself and get some rest than this is the place. Thank you Mike and Jenny for a great experience."

The road lead you precisely to your covered garage. The loft is impeccably clean and exceptionally appointed. You will find everything you need to cook in a great stove. We liked the decoration on the south Texas style. Comfy armchairs on the living. Then the swimming pool very near your front door and charcoal and gas grills with tools and charcoal (this is a first) for your use. Then the rear deck for seeing the stars at night or by the one of two fire pits available. Mike and Jenny were very friendly and attentive and we thank them so much for being the perfect hosts. We already want to get back there again and will when we get the chance."

These hosts left no stone unturned regarding anything you could want. Such a great place to land between our wildlife/bird guided photography tours at La Lomita. I was hoping to jump into the pool one evening, but we were too tuckered out. However, we enjoyed loving on the horses and goats. Great visit with Mike. If ever in the area again we'll be here, hopefully with more time to relax and enjoy this great guesthouse. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Mike & Jenny’s place is absolutely fantastic. We were looking for a nice place for a weekend getaway in the country and we found it! All questions we had were answered quickly and clearly. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Mike. Speaking with him while we fed carrots to the horses was a real pleasure. Mike is a fascinating person and a joy to talk to.
The house was spotless and beautifully designed and built. All of the amenities were top notch. Mike and Jenny’s attention to detail is immediately noticeable.
We stopped by Dziuk’s Meat Market in Castroville (highly recommended) and picked up a few Texas quality ribeye cuts. Mike made sure we had enough mesquite wood for grilling and lit the fire. Nothing like Texas beef cooked over mesquite in the country to make for a good night.
The bathroom was immaculate and exceeded expectations. The shower was spotless and well designed. We spent the rest of the evening in the comfortable classic chairs on the main level playing scrabble and soaking in the Mike and Jenny’s modern-rustic designed home.
The bed was so comfortable we are probably going to replace our mattress at home with the same model! Can’t wait to go back for another enjoyable weekend. Book a stay with confidence. You won’t regret it!"

I mean, everything was top notch - from the shower to the bed (super comfy) to the outside spaces and the thoughtful touches (snacks, drinks, and carrots for the horses). Two things stand out even more than the rest - getting to spend time with the horses and goats (there were the most adorable baby goats!) and Mike and Jenny's genuine hospitality. Mike was willing to share some of his extensive knowledge about the area and horses and farming in general, and we learned so much! Jenny is so friendly and funny - had us laughing!

Stayed one night","Mike and Jenny were very welcoming and friendly hosts. The farm stay was amazing and location was just outside of town so getting around was very easy. The loft was very clean and made you feel at home. We had fun swimming in the pool, using the BBQ pit, petting the sweet horses and cute goats. The best part for us was being able to view the stars at night. I definitely recommend staying here if you want to experience a country yet modern getaway."

Stayed a few nights","This was the best air bnb my Husband and I have ever stayed at. Mike was so kind and welcoming. The place was beautiful and spotless. I loved the horses, we got to feed them carrots and apples. The turkey was so beautiful and the goats were adorable. This place is about 30 minutes from the frio river so it’s a perfect location if you want to be close enough to the frio but not so close that you have all the traffic and stuff. Main Street is about a 10 minute drive and they have an HEB, Starbucks, ad whataburger, everything a Texas girl needs. I can’t wait to go back again."

The host were very helpful although the app made it difficult for us to communicate they accommodated us with all of the issues the app gave us. The horses are beautiful along with all of the other great personal amenities. The place gives off a modern farm feel peaceful and quaint. Will definitely come back just to enjoy it all over again we didn’t want to leave. 10/10 recommend !!

Stayed a few nights","First off, this is a true escape from the city life. Jenny and Mike are incredibly kind and inviting. It almost feels like you are taking over their ranch and they are the guests.
It felt like they did everything in their power to make our stay feel like a home away from home. This is one of those locations where you enjoy running into your hosts because the conversations we had were great.
They have plenty of animals that you can interact with if you’d like.
As far as location, I think it’s just perfect with how far out of town it is (maybe 10 minutes to downtown). Even if you are trying to go to Garner State Park or the Frio, I preferred to stay near Uvalde since there is a little more to do town wise.
We will definitely be coming back when we get the chance.
Thank you Mike and Jenny!"

They also have goats, some cattle, and a turkey with a lot of character, haha! The home is stunning, felt so cozy, and extremely clean. Mike is extremely friendly and stayed up until 1 AM to help us find this place as we weren’t from the area. If you are questioning if you should book this place...book it. You will not regret it."

A/C worked great, was nice to come back to a cool house .
Just a few minutes drive into Uvalde, but feels like a different world when you get to the ranch.
We had a water pump go out during our stay. Austin and Sarah had people out the same evening to get it running. Great helpful hosts."

Close enough to town if we needed something, but far enough away from everything to enjoy the serenity and awesomeness of the great outdoors. All of the positive reviews previously shared are warranted - thank you for having us at War Horse Ranch and hope to return sometime in the future! The ONLY thing we were bummed about was that we never received a visit from the Ranch dog(s), but will look to capture that next time."

Stayed a few nights","The place is awesome and area was very quiet.
Thats why i rented the house because of location. But there were a few problems, the front lock didn't work to get in so we had to get in the house thru the garage. Every time we left we had to open and close garage door. Second the toilet in main restroom kept running so we would have to take top off and push plunger down so it would fill up. Third we weren't the only tenets in the house, mice invaded the house and the first night we had to throw out our food that we left on the counter. We were watching tv and they would come out and run around the living room. My wife cleaned kitchen and by the morning mouse droppings were all over counter. I know it is country living but there are solutions for this!"

We had plenty of room for the six of us to enjoy resting and having family meals together. This home has nice touches that make it feel like a resort including comfortable beds, beautiful furnishings, and amazing soap and lotion. We had plenty of towels, kitchen supplies, and toiletries for our stay. The house stayed really cool during the day, despite the Texas sun. While visiting, one of our favorite things to do was sit on the front porch watching the wildlife. We saw rabbits, axis deer, whitetail deer, hawks, and birds. The stars at night were amazing. We used stargazer apps to locate constellations, identify planets, and enjoyed the breeze and peace and quiet, all from the front porch. We spent time in Uvalde (about 5 minutes to town) and at Garner State Park (about 40 minutes away) during our trip. Austin & Sarah are great hosts. They were quick to respond to questions and thought out every detail to make our stay incredible. The home is easy to find with the directions they provided. This was an amazing stay.

Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay at the Warhorse Ranch. The property was beautiful and the home is just spacious enough. The property is also located inside a gated property . We enjoyed cooking out on the grill and the quiet evenings. The property had every amenity you would expect and some very unique touches. War Horse ranch is a wonderful secluded place to stay. Quite and peaceful yet close enough to Uvalde and easy to get to.

No noise and just nature at is best. The home was spotless clean. From every room indoors and outdoors. Wal-Mart and Heb down the road. It is so close to everything really. We have never been to Uvalde or the Frio River. This was our first time we spend most of times in Garner park and Chalk Buff Park. We cooked meals and breakfast at the house. Austin and Sarah where amazing in responding to any questions we had. This is definitely and amazing place to stay. Mornings we where greated with deer wich was amazing. If you want to disconect from city this is the place to be. Wish we had more time untill next time.

The place was sparkling clean, like CLEAN! All the linens - pillows, towels, everything down to the mattress smelled fresh.
The property was so big! Since we have a lifted truck and off road tires, we decided to drive through the trails and saw so much wild life. They have little watering holes everywhere, we saw a Bobcat, deer, ground birds and I think a turkey or some kind of large ground bird, and tons of bunnies.
Host communications were quick and accurate.
We absolutely loved this property and are looking forward to returning in the near future."

The style of the house is a perfect blend of stylish modern and rustic vibes without being too rustic. Water pressure is a bit low but that’s expected for being on a well. Such a great recharge space. Excited to see it in all seasons.

Stayed with kids","Seeing nature’s beauty and the wildlife from the front porch was stunning. It’s always so refreshing to walk into a home that’s sparkling clean. The lodge gave us the secluded feel, but the drive into town was only about 10 minutes. After our 6.5 hour drive to Uvalde, I used Wal-Mart pickup and brought our groceries to the lodge. Make sure to pickup some fresh tortillas, salsa, and chips at H‑E‑B though ;) It’s impossible for my family to travel without a washer and dryer, which was one of the many reasons we chose War Horse Lodge. The washer and dryer were extremely efficient and clean! One of my favorite things about War Horse Lodge was the organic homemade soap provided. Sarah and Austin were very responsive to any questions or concerns we had. I would definitely add Garner State Park as a must see in the area, it was a stunning experience to fish, swim, hike and explore. I would recommend War Horse Lodge to everyone looking to stay in or around Uvalde."

The house is absolutely beautiful and was very clean! We enjoyed the variety of wild life (especially the bunnies). We even saw a porcupine! Each morning we enjoyed hikes and playing family games outside. Our hosts gave us great suggestions for eating out, which we enjoyed thoroughly. Hot afternoons were spent indoors playing board games, working puzzles and watching shows on a giant tv. We grilled out at night, but we didn't get to use the kiva (a bit too warm still). Austin & Sarah were wonderful hosts and we were blessed to stay in their amazing home!"

Speaking of nights, I highly recommend for guests who visit to step outside at night with all the exterior lights of the house turned off. It will be dark and you'll be able to see so many stars that can't be seen in the big cities. Seeing so many shooting stars at night was a the highlight of the weekend our city kids. And being 10 minutes from town (with restaurants and grocery stores) made this a wonderful location for a relaxing getaway. We'll definitely return."

It is obvious that Sarah and Austin have put great thought and care into making guests feel welcome and taken care of! It is a beautiful location bordered by the river where there is a pristine (private) spring fed water hole to relax, swim or even fish. The kiva is a beautiful space as well! We drank coffee and watched the sun come up every morning. In the evening we watched the deer, rabbits, birds and other wildlife while enjoying the breeze! I can’t wait to visit again when the weather is cooler so we can build a fire! It was perfect! Only 10 minutes from town and 30 minutes from Concan (if you like crowds) and yet we felt totally secluded and shielded from the outside world!
Thank you Sarah and Austin! Hope to see you again soon!"

Situated just outside of Uvalde on a delightfully rural ranch, Adobe Lodge offers the best of both worlds: modern convenience and natural, west Texas beauty. Clean and comfortable, gorgeously appointed, with sprawling natural landscapes and abundant wildlife, Adobe Lodge exceeded our expectations. It's close enough to town to pick up groceries and only half an hour away from Garner State Park. Enjoy a lovely sunrise while drinking a cup of coffee in the quaint courtyard garden in the morning while rabbits scamper in the yard and birds sing, then end the day with a tall glass of cold, sweet tea while the moon comes up and resident deer graze yards away from the front porch. Adobe Lodge is spectacular and we cannot wait to go back!"

The only negative review here on Airbnb is the roosters, but the first one didn't crow for us until 11 am. I found it cute rather than annoying. You put a lot of effort into the table setting and have a very well equipped bathroom (and also a kitchen, but we only used the fridge for water and coke). In Uvalde we got everything we needed at the H-E-B nearby."

The one and only reason I didn't leave a 5 star rating is that the place is surrounded by Roosters that start crowing at 3 am and we stayed on the weekend and the neighbors blasted music that started at 10pm and ended at 4am and ran their motors super loud. I understand this is out of the hosts hands. Even with that being said, I would stay here again in the future."

Stayed one night","Absolutely impressed! Lilly’s place is safe and pristine! It is extremely clean and well stocked and maintained. When you walk in you can smell and feel how clean it is. Each room had extra amenities from the utensils to the kitchen to the extra towels in the bathroom. There are also extra blankets, robes, and light fixtures. I appreciate this bc I prefer dim lighting. The outside space is relaxing and spacious. This is the most comfortable, clean, and impressive place I have stayed at. I felt as though I was staying at a luxurious bungalow. I had a restful sleep which is rare when I travel. I was impressed with the extra privacy; curtains for the back door and the front translucent windows. This place is decorated with warm and welcoming decor. Every guest comfort and need is reflected in the decor, ambience, and amenity. My only regret is I didn’t stay longer! I’ll book here in the summer for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Sunny Days was absolutely wonderful. Lilly was very responsive to our question even before we booked the stay.
The decor was lovely and the cottage was very cozy. The coffee bar was such a nice treat and the ice maker was full. Amenities were first class and bed/mattress was very comfortable. We visited family so we didn’t use the kitchen but I saw it was well stocked. It was a great experience! I hope to visit again. Thank you Lilly for sharing your cottage."

Stayed a few nights","Good location, great bathroom space. Super comfy bed. Very clean, nice and comfy.
Make sure to look closely for the amenities you are going to need, the place might not have those things.
The place is located behind a business, so be on the lookout for that when getting there.
Downside: when you open the main door people from the parking lot in front are able to see straight to the inside, all the way to the bed. That was a little off.
Other than that, it was really good."

The accommodations were very clean and comfortable. The location in downtown Uvalde was extremely convenient to restaurants and shopping."

Jennifer was extremely fast and responsive and changed the whole bedding with a brand new set. She was super quick in response and was a wonderful host. 10/10 would definitely stay again! The place was so cute and next door is a fun bar that opens late ($4 and $5 cocktails specials!)"

The linens were clean and comfortable. The shower was amazing. I loved the towels they had so much I ordered a set of my own before I left. The snacks and coffee were great, also the selection of bathroom toiletries if you forgot something was spot on. The space is small but everything is curated perfectly. Wish I had more time to enjoy this space, but next time I'm in Uvalde this will definitely be the place I stay at. I can easily say Jennifer truly cares that you have a great stay, and we did!"

The room smelt amazing! The linens and Queen bed were comfortable. Towels were high quality. AC was super quiet and blew super cold. Beautiful shower! WiFi, TV, Microwave, Coffee Maker, fridge, and sink. We loved the decor! They did a really good job with this place and it can't be beat. There is great parking right in front of the Casita and if you are pulling a trailer or extra vehicle there is a public parking lot right behind the site. The host was super friendly and very responsive, giving us local restaurant recommendations and making sure we were as comfortable as possible. Host gave us complimentary snacks, drinks, and a nice personal note. Check in and check out was also super easy. We will stay here next time we are in the area. I would recommend you choose this place over any local hotel."
