Stayed a few nights","Cade was super responsive and super clear with instructions. He checked with us more than once on our stay to make sure everything was okay. The only down of our stay was that the pictures did not match exactly what was in the apartment. furniture was moved around, taken out, or completely different. it was a little disappointing but we made it work. it was overall a clean and good for what we needed."

Stayed a few nights","Cade was amazing at responding and being attentive throughout the entire stay! We had a little issue getting inside, but Cade was fast-responding and solved the problem immediately! Everything was clean and tidy and easy parking! The walls are a little thin, so you can hear the people in surrounding the other apartments, but nothing too overbearing! Just something to keep in mind when booking, but I would definitely book with Cade again!"

Stayed one night","Cades space is super cute and has a warm feeling. I loved the old furniture! I did not personally have a good experience, but blame most of it on the unusually cold weather in Texas. When I arrived at 9:00 my space was freezing and continued to be so throughout the night and the next morning. This definitely put a damper on my stay. Cade was kind in communication, but there wasn’t much he could do at 10 o’clock at night."

Stayed a few nights","I was unable to get into my air bnb, and contacted the host via Airbnb message, phone call, and text and did not receive a response for 3 hours. As it was later in the night, I had to find other accommodations. Cade eventually did respond and refunded me for that night without hassle. The stay after that was very pleasant. The space is very nice and beautifully decorated. I did enjoy my stay over all, although the check in was difficult. The location was perfect, right next to ACU and HSU, and very close to downtown. I would recommend contacting the host well before you check in if you are going to stay here."

A bit too hot to walk, but a short drive to restaurants (Front Porch for coffee/ breakfast was good) and convenient for I20. Street parking was easy and right outside the door. Nice neighborhood. Would definitely stay again if passing through again."

I did meet Michael upon our arrival and he was a very friendly and warm fellow, and was very considerate regarding the parking spaces to allow us to use his driveway because we had two vehicles that would not have fit comfortably on the curb out front otherwise.
The apartment was very clean and extremely cozy. It is absolutely perfect for a single traveler or a couple such as ourselves. We could tell they take great pride in their AirBnB and want their guests to be comfortable and relaxed. They clearly pay great attention to detail and left little handwritten notes pointing out coffee they had left for us or additional charging ports for electronic devices. The location is great, as we were only a couple miles from Abilene’s downtown area yet still very private!We would highly recommend this spot for future travelers!! You will not be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay in this clean, beautiful, cozy, historic home!
I was traveling with my 78-year-old mom and my 17-year-old son, for a visit to ACU.
My mom joined us because she was born and grew up in Abilene. The house was full of history, and lots of thoughtful touches that showcased Abilene, and my mom absolutely loved all of the memorabilia and unique features!
Even better, there were lots of ￼neat things in the house, like an etch-a-sketch, and an old fashioned game called Shoot the Moon. We LOVED that my teenager was excited to try these out and challenge himself! We enjoyed so much unplugged family time!
The house is in pristine shape, and obviously well cared for and cleaned! We really enjoyed it, and would definitely definitely return!
The neighborhood is peaceful, quiet, and well-maintained. there’s a beautiful church across the street from the house. We got to watch a bride take her wedding portraits outside the church, and loved the Sunday morning bells!"

Thank you Laura for working with us in several directions!
You’ll be our go to when in the Abilene area.

Beds were really comfortable, too. The big backyard had a couple of good tables for drinking morning coffee (or eating a meal if you wanted to). The nice, safe, quiet neighborhood was a big plus."

Stayed one night","Not often do you stumble upon a place so perfectly, perfect. My words may not do this space justice, but here goes:
Laura's place was not only immaculate, the over one hundred year old home has great bones.
Solid. Stable. Quiet, friendly neighborhood.
Laura has remodeled the home with thoughtful intention. It reminded me of the place I grew up in.
Such attention to detail. I have stayed in nearly 100 Airbnbs and I slept better in this place than any other.
Everything about this place was divine. There was no kitch, no over the top cookie cutter decor, or fluff, instead, the ambiance was a throwback from the time where families gathered and enjoyed their time together.
The beds were so comfy, the quality of the linens and kitchen amenities was exceptional. Even though it was 110 degrees in Abilene, the temperature inside remained consistently cool.
The hourly chime from the church across the street was reminiscent of simpler times. Sweet nostalgia for me."

There is also a large park an easy 1/2 mile walk away with a great playground and tennis courts. The house itself is very charming and comfortable and the outdoor spaces in front and back are very inviting. Loved it!

Stayed with kids","Wow! What a wonderful home to stay in - perfect for a family like ours! My husband and I stayed in the room with the attached bathroom. The room with the white-framed full size bed connected to our room with a door, so was perfect for our 10 month old son to stay in with his travel crib. Laura also has a pack and play that was perfect for the living room area to contain our son while we needed to pack up. The 3rd bedroom was perfect for our cousin staying with us and was far enough from the baby’s room in case of noise :).
It was so nice to be able to do laundry the night before we left and the amenities were so nice in general! Loved the snacks and Keurig available as well. Super clean with lovely decor and historical Abilene information all around the house in the form of books, fun photos, etc. We will definitely look to stay here again when we visit family. It was a home away from home for us as it was similar in size to our house too. Really spectacular value and a gem of an AirBnB in Abilene!!"

Stayed a few nights","This has been my very favorite Air Bnb as of yet. We travel the world and this house has been my only place that truly feels like home. The amount of thought into this lovely, charismatic, inviting and historical! home is just perfect. You will walk in, and will never feel you need to leave. I found the Green Gables because it was minutes from downtown (which surprisingly the downtown is new and awesome! I’m a Houstonian and past London resident, and wow, there is so much to eat, drink, shop and explore now in Abilene! Who knew?? Make sure to see the standout Grace Museum and the new boutiques for both men and women downtown. All walkable. You can grab a drink at the Pour House and stroll the whole downtown.
Besides the history of the beautiful house and the impeccable cleanliness and soft towels and sheets-
It’s the surprising touches that make this destination home unusual. They have a rock garden! I wonder where they found so many different varieties of rocks and stones?? Such an amazingly serene backyard. I ate dinner on the back patio, cooked lunch to eat on the side terrace and could not BELIEVE I heard an assembly of bagpipes, over my evening wine, practicing on the lawn of the gorgeous Gothic-inspired architectural church a few doors down. On a morning coffee walk, I actually laid on the grass below the spires of the massive bell tower and took the most amazing sunset pics! Neighbors would walk their pups by on the street and say hello as I drank coffee and they told me stories of the historic neighborhood.
The in-town hosts were available for every odd question I had! I actually never needed anything, but it was so nice to know they were readily available and so kind to my (probably too constant) texts.
This home was too well stocked. You will see. It’s too much to type but I read two of their amazing books, I tried different coffees, placed beautiful rocks on top of their piles and secretly looked over the beautiful fence at the little chickens next door! Don’t do that.
Honestly, it is the place you will come back to. I never repeat a vacation or experience because I believe in- learning more! But I excuse myself on this one.
I just wish I knew all of the stories and history behind the fascinating art, newspaper articles and furnishings.
Perfect place for a single business trip, a family needing 3 bedrooms or a fun girl’s trip to check out the new Abilene."

The host was friendly and gave us detailed instructions that made checking-in and checking-out easy. The place itself was cozy and fun!

They are both so kind and interesting people. The place was clean, quiet, and the small things added up. From the bluetooth speaker, the shampoo , conditioner, and body wash, kcups, games, and them even inviting me over to join them for a conversation next to the firepit on their back porch. They also have 2 small dogs that made my heart so happy to play with. They made me feel very welcome and I will definitely stay here again if ever I need to pass through Abilene."

Counters, bathroom and loft area. Very comfortable. It is truly a tiny little house. Perfect for 2 people. Danny also was very responsive. Had a question, he answered it. Needed something. Before I knew it, it was sitting on the chair outside my door. I told him he moves faster than FedEx.lol. The hot chocolate and snacks were great too. It was cold outside so a hot drink was just what the doctor ordered. Also the space heater and multi level unit keep the place cozy and warm. The neighbor was very nice and quite. I slept like a baby. The price was well worth the services. Great for a weekend getaway.
Very satisfied customer,

The loft seems small, but I was surprised at how comfy and spacious it was. The shower is a very unique addition and added to the rustic feel. Place was clean and so close to downtown!"

Stayed one night","This is one of those ""must have"" places on your travel list! The drive up, signage and fence are all welcoming, and inside felt like enough space. It is a small area but every piece and placement of furniture is so intentional that it creates a smooth and crisp experience of hospitality. I loved the upper loft! The ladder is thick and sturdy. The space below the ladder has ample room to store luggage and the bathroom is awesome! Love the hinge door. The kitchenette counter felt like enough space, and the shelves above the kitchenette greatly complimented the living area. Again, perfect flow of space, things, accents and utility! The fire pit/outdoor seating area is also ""just right"" like the indoor space. I adored the outdoor birdhouses along the back fence, and, soaking in the backdrop of the gentle, open, pink sky of Abilene! Ah, most importantly, Danny was welcoming, available and I felt like a valued guest. Come check this place out!"

Danny and Suzanne were terrific hosts. Quick to respond, thoroughwith instructions, even left tips and tricks notes in the bnb. The backyard and covered patio space was beautiful. The only things I was a bit bummed by was not getting to meet the dogs! Lol. Parking was pretty easy, thanks to the detailed instruction. Overall a great stay! [ps: curly haired potential visitors, they supplied a diffuser with their blow dryer!!!] I hope to stay again on my next visit to town."

The loft and bathroom are very fun and one of a kind. The instructions for arriving were very clear and easy. The hosts were very easy to communicate with and some of the most fun to talk to. I can't say enough great things about the space and Danny and Suzanne. I highly recommend and will definitely be choosing this space again for my next visit. Thank you guys again for your wonderfulness!

Probably not suitable for larger people. The bedroom is in the loft so not a lot of headroom and the shower is pretty tight. But it’s a tiny house! And it’s cute! Thoughtful touches throughout."

Stayed a few nights","Our second stay in this location, and we have nothing bad to say about either experience. Ceci has made thoughtful updates to the house to make it charming and very comfortable. Linens and towels are clean, furniture and beds are comfortable, and the house feels very accommodating and welcoming. We love that there is driveway parking and the house is on a very quiet cul de sac, close to some of our favorite restaurants from college (we recommend Little Panda and Sharky’s!). Will continue to book with Ceci as often as possible."

We will definitely look for availability here on future trips to see our daughter at ACU!

We had space to have family over to visit before and after the wedding. And it’s a fabulously well stocked kitchen! The flatware is even heavy and nice like you would have in your home, not that sharp edged lightweight stuff. The third bedroom was far enough away from the other two that we were able to invite my father to stay over with us for one night and not be awakened by his snores. Three of my older relatives kept exclaiming about how nice it was, and they had no idea that this was available through Airbnb… Some of the children complained to their parents they weren’t staying in as nice a place."

Efficient air conditioning kept the place very cool despite ~110F outside. The front bedroom with very high ceiling feels particularly special.

The home slept 8 very comfortably, and had a great stocked kitchen (which we used a lot.) Instacart and crumble cookies delivered to the property. The proximity to the community lake and playground/pool area was a bonus as we had kids with us, including one who caught 2 great catfish in the pond (we could watch them from the living room.) The property was minutes from Walmart and Walgreens, which was very convenient. The owners responded to our questions almost immediately, and were so sweet to work with. There were little nice touches all over the home, including laundry soap (in case you forgot it like I did!) and there were even cute little Christmasy decorations. Overall a great stay with no issues. Thanks again!"

Cleverly decorated, it's located in a quiet neighborhood where you can go for a walk and then go for a swim in the community pool. You are minutes away from delicious restaurants, either by Abilene Christian University or anywhere else in Abilene.
The hosts were most responsive to any need or question we had. They welcomed us as we first arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. They also made recommendations of things to do and places to eat. Who doesn't love that when you're new to town? If we needed something, it was delivered or the question was answered very quickly.
Definitely 5 stars for this Airbnb! We will stay here again the next time we're in Abilene!"

Group trip","This home was the perfect spot for our family weekend in Abilene. It's in a neighborhood that is off the beaten path so it peaceful and quite, yet easy to access. The setup was great for what we needed. There is no ""master suite"" which is actually a HUGE benefit for a larger group. 2 bedrooms share a jack-n-jill bathroom on both sides of the house with a 1/2 bath in the hallway that divides the house. There isn't a dining room but the kitchen bar area gave plenty of seating for what we needed. The parking is wonderful in the back of the house if you have multiple cars. The decor is done so well and very interesting to read about Abilene athletes who have excelled in various sports....thus the name: Hall of Fame House. The owners are so kind and brought a crock pot for us to use in the kitchen during our stay. Will definitely stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful new home in a quiet neighborhood within a ten minute drive (or less) to everything Abilene has to offer. We loved everything about our stay. The owners have thought about every detail to ensure an enjoyable stay. We appreciated the layout of the home. One side of the house had two bedrooms each with queen beds and a connected shared bath. The other side of the house had two bedrooms, one with a queen bed, the other with two twins beds and they shared a connected bath. There is also a half bath in the hallway next to the huge laundry room! Great layout for two families. The kitchen and living room are beautiful with plenty of room for conversations. There is not a kitchen table but plenty of dining space for six with a large island with stools and a bar with stools. Also a patio table in the side yard just off the kitchen. The community pool was a nice reprieve from the Texas summer heat. Owners are quick to respond with any question you may have. Will definitely be back!!!"

Stayed with kids","This is probably the best rental experience we’ve ever had, and we rent vacation homes often! This home is fresh and clean, decorated beautifully, and has tons of special touches - luxury towels and bedding, treats for the guests, extra toiletries just in case. The house is wonderful, and the location is super close to ACU.
One thing to note - there is not a master bedroom. There are two rooms connected with a Jack-n-Jill bathroom on each side of the house. We didn’t mind sharing a bathroom with our children, and all the bedrooms are large and feel luxurious (really!), so we didn’t mind, but it is something some might want to know.
Probably one of my favorite things - they do not require you to do a million things before you leave. I really hate it when owners charge a cleaning fee but then require guests to spend an hour cleaning before check out. This owner requires very little, so it really does feel more like a B&B or hotel experience. I appreciate that so much.
All in all, we loved this home and would love to stay any time we’re in town."
