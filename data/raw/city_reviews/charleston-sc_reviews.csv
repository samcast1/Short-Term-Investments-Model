Stayed a few nights","Wow. There are no other words to describe this classy & pristine beach house. We stayed to celebrate my son's 21st birthday. He is a Citadel Cadet, so finding a nice place to stay for us was very important. This amazing house was perfect. It was spotless, amazing view, and beautiful accommodations, and the beds were just perfect. The view - and the beach - simply perfect. We were able to relax and still enjoy all the amenities that Folly Beach offers. Amazing hosts. Awesome recommendations. WE WILL BE BACK. JUST BOOK IT!"

Stayed with a pet","My boyfriend and I came down to this property for a long weekend for his birthday. We were able to bring our dog and it was such a restful time away from the hustle and bustle of every day. The dog thoroughly enjoyed the fenced yard, and because of the time of the year, we were able to to take him down to Folly Beach to play in the water, via direct beach access from the house.
The property was in mint condition, which is great to see, considering they do allow animals on site. Everything was very clean, very good instructions, very easy, and the host was very accommodating.
It was a quick drive to downtown Charleston, which was perfect for us to go during the day and sightsee, but come back to the restfulness and peacefulness of the ocean front property at night. When looking at a map, it does say about a 30 minute drive to downtown, but keep in mind 10 of those minutes is just to get from the house to downtown Folly Beach. From there it's a quick shot to the highway.
We would recommend this property, hands-down, any day. Well worth the cost!"

Stayed a few nights","I was searching for a place near Charleston and ended up coming across The Sandy Dog Beach House. This was the perfect spot for my family, and I was so happy to find a place where I was allowed to bring my pups along with us! Being steps from the beach was a dream come true. We could walk right outside with our son and play in the sand, and the dogs enjoyed stretching their legs in the fenced-in yard. The views from the balconies were so beautiful, especially catching the sunrise over the water! We will definitely stay here again when we make a trip back next year! The hosts were very responsive and kind."

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The furnishings and beds (and pillows) were extremely comfortable. Communication was good. The house is away from the bustle of town which makes for a relaxing stay. The only complaint is that they do not offer beach chairs or towels. I would expect at a beach house these items would be offered, especially at the price. They suggest a rental company for this but who wants to be bothered with that on an expensive beach vacation? Other than that the house was lovely and would recommend."

Stayed a few nights","The house has a well-equipped kitchen. Check-in is easy and the bathrooms all has soap shampoo and body wash. There were plenty of fluffy white towels and special black make up towels. They do not provide any beach towels or beach chairs so be sure to bring your own. This is a pet friendly house, and we did not bring any pets but be aware there were places in the yard that previous people did not clean up after their pets. Yuck! There are 2 nice porches on the front of the house but the house in front of this one has really strong flood lights that automatically come on from dusk until dawn and it makes it impossible to sit outside at night without feeling like you are in an interrogation room. they also light up the master bedroom at night and can be annoying."

Stayed with kids","My family and I had a blast at the Sandy Dog Beach house. The moment we arrived everything was sparkling clean and laid out exactly like the pictures. The beach is only steps away and that proximity was a game changer for us. Jane and Dave as well as Duvet were so responsive when we had any questions.
Our stay in Folly Beach at the Sandy Dog was without a doubt one of the best family vacations we have ever been on. The house is absolutely beautiful and interior is very well designed with the fresh modern look and with updated appliances. The sectional with the chaise lounge was our favorite spot to unwind after a great day at the beach. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this special place!
Thank you, Jane and Dave!"

Stayed a few nights","We prefer to stay in Folly Beach bc it's beautiful and quaint. This house was perfect for our family to relax, play games, walk on the beach, and go back and forth from Charleston, Mt Pleasant and Sullivan's Island. We looked forward to our evenings together by the ocean. The one sunny day, we spent a few hours on the deck drinking coffee and chatting. The other 2 days were rainy but the house was comfy and we didn't mind at all. We didn't rent a golf cart this time so we had to drive to Taco Boy and Berts, but there was no trouble parking bc of the time of year. Stay Duvet made plenty of towels, toilet paper, soaps, etc available. We never needed to replace any paper products or toiletries. We will stay again next time we are in the Charleston area.🌴"

It is perfectly situated so that all the popular spots are in walking distance, yet it’s far enough that you get privacy and no noise at night. Tim was a fantastic host, he reached out to let us know that he was available if we needed something. I ended up breaking something and felt terrible about it, I sent the pictures to Tim but he told me that it was ok and he would take care of it. The house is extremely comfy and cozy, and Tim goes over the top to make your experience one you will never forget. Tim had coffee, wine, snacks, band-aids, Tums, and even an Alexa device to guide you with restaurants, shopping and other touristy things to do. When I come back, I’ll stay here again!"

The beds are so incredibly comfy, the kitchen has anything you’d ever need and the sunny bright rooms are so inviting. The dedicated parking space is a huge bonus as we were doing lots of errands for the wedding. My favorite part though, is the outside patio where we sipped morning coffee and afternoon wine and friends stopped by to say hello. We will DEFINITELY be back. Thanks Tim!"

Instructions for everything were super clear and he was proactive and responsive in his communication. The location couldn't have been better. It's in a quiet part of the historic district of Charleston and walkable to everything we wanted to do. The farthest we walked was 30 minutes to restaurants and most attractions were at most a 15 minute walk. We were always grateful after a busy day to get back to Tim's quiet, beautiful place. I highly recommend the nearby Queen Street Grocery for breakfast or lunch."

We loved and appreciated all of the extras such as coffee, cream, wine, snacks, plenty of towels, umbrellas… He thought of everything. From Tim’s we walked to restaurants, shopping, and cocktails. Our only driving was to the beaches. We sat on the cute patio in the front yard by the fountain and enjoyed visiting with each other and the passersby. My only regret is that we forgot to sign the guest book!"

We used the house bikes to explore, and followed several of the suggestions in his iPad guide. The house was thoughtfully stocked with coffee, snacks, and even wine! He got back to us immediately when we had questions, let us check in early, and did everything possible to make our stay easy. We loved it and will definitely try to stay here again next time we visit, and have already recommended it to friends. Thank you, Tim!!"

The house is in the historic residential area, and thus was very quiet in the evening. The location provided an easy walk to all the major restaurants, shopping, and numerous historic sites. The Battery and Ashley River was also in proximity.
We would highly recommend Tim’s apartment and would stay there again if given the opportunity."

Having a dedicated parking spot was a huge plus. It was also very nice to have a washer and dryer available to us. Tim was very responsive.

Stayed with kids","We weren't sure where to stay in town but were very thankful we found Tim's place. It's close enough for easy walking to good food, restaurants, a small grocery, and most charming parts of the city. It's also relaxing to come back to, being quiet and off the main drags.
It's a cool, historic building that shows its age in a good way. Everything was clean and there was plenty of space. Tim provided everything we needed, gave us enough privacy to make the place feel like ours, and even dropped off coffee filters 5 minutes after messaging him about them.
I would highly recommend Tim's place for the location if you want a calm and quiet base to explore and aren't expecting a thriving bar scene a block away. The house and the host make it a great combo."

All the amenities were provided, clean, new, etc. There's even cookware, an instant-pot if you felt like cooking, although, with the awesome restaurant scene in Charleston, who would?! Everything functioned as it should, the AC was nice and cold, fans, lights, wi-fi all worked flawlessly. The windows are a little thin, so you do hear outside noise, which isn't an issue for me, but my wife hears everything. She brought a white noise machine (she brings it everywhere we go) and had no problems. The parking spot is 1 ft from the door, seriously. I was literally handing suitcases from the trunk, to my wife, standing at the door. It couldn't be any easier, and with most places having street or valet, this was a HUGE benefit. A wonderful stay and certainly wouldn't hesitate to return."

The location cannot be beat - you don’t have to use a car your whole trip, walking distance to everything we wanted to see! Tim’s place was impeccably clean. The place also has everything you could ever need - Tim includes travel sizes of every toiletry you need (including makeup wipes and mouthwash!), the kitchen is fully stocked, including with snack bars, coffee pods, individual creamers, and all cookware and utensils - and even 2 bottles of wine! The location is pretty quiet, but Tim still included a sound machine for the occasional passerby. The beds and pillows were so comfortable and sheets were so soft. Tim was also so accommodating with early checkin and late checkout, and so friendly and willing to help when needed. 10/10 would come here again."

We had no need for a rental car, as all of Charleston's numerous historic sites, shops and restaurants were easy walking distance from Tim's. We can't say enough great things about our stay, or about Tim, who was a warm and gracious host! The apartment combined modern comfort with the lovely architectural details one would expect in an historic Charleston home. The neighborhood was extremely safe, and very quiet at night. We are already looking forward to our next stay at Tim's wonderful home."

This wonderful home and Tim's attention to our every need enabled us to feel like we were living in Charleston as opposed to visiting this glorious city. From the snacks, wine, super comfortable beds and furnishings to a kitchen that was equipped to fit every need from a casual snack to a complete meal, this house had it all. We walked everywhere, used Tim's suggestions for dining opportunities and casual bites, and drove easily to North Charleston, and the islands.

The king sized bed was as nice as any I have ever slept on. A sitting area out front was a nice place to have a cocktail and enjoy the passers by.

It’s located a perfect distance from King St

Has a private parking spot that our guests and Ubers utilized a few times
It is extremely well air conditioned, which was critical during the days we were there
The kitchen is great and seats 6 comfortably… Sbux coffee (Keurig) and light snacks were generously provided
It’s extremely private, first floor rear entrance
Comfortable beds, couches, pillows, sheets, etc… also had beach towels which we also utilized
Our host was fantastic and very accommodating, I’d go back and I’d highly recommend it.
And I have to say that I think our group had pretty high standards, and they were exceeded.

My mom and I had the best time and will definitely stay here during our next visit to Charleston!"

Easy walk to restaurants, rooftop bars, waterfont. But quiet neighborhood without late-night craziness. We greeted each day eager to explore a new neighborhood. Wine at day's end in front courtyard with peaceful fountain. Rare parking spot. Tim was an angel host. Highly recommend."

The convenient location, the linens, and towels, the French press, a kitchen with everything, washer dryer, ROKU, consistent comfortable temperature, front brick patio, and free parking. So much better than a hotel room because you can spread out and do your own thing or gather together. Tim. was always responsive and attentive. I will go back as soon as I can."

Stayed a few nights","This unit and Tim were both fantastic! A real home away from home in the heart of Charleston. The house is so charming, with tons of historic character. The floors are a little slanted in some places, but I found that it just adds to the character.
My husband and I stayed 5 nights and fell in love with this charming space. There is a gigantic master bedroom with king size bed, closet, and dresser. The second ""bedroom"" is a sunroom off the back entrance/kitchen with a full wall of windows on two sides and a curtain to close it off (no door). It's at the opposite end of the unit from the other bedroom, so it still feels private. Since there were just 2 of us, we used the second bedroom space for storing our things. The master bed was comfortable, as was the bedding. I didn't test out the second bed, but it looked comfy as well.
The bathroom had plenty of storage and counter space and the provided toiletries were good quality. We had plenty of towels and those were nice too.
The kitchen was amazing and well appointed. There was even an instant pot! The coffee maker is a Keurig and the host provided a good supply of k-cups. There were little coffee mates in the fridge for creamer as well. There is on-demand hot water at the kitchen sink for tea, and a French press for ground coffee. The fridge and freezer were huge and had plenty of storage space for a week's worth of groceries. There were even snacks and wine for us in the welcome basket. Such a great touch!
The living room was very comfortable, with a big couch and comfortable chair and a large TV and coffee table. The TV has a Roku device, so you can sign in to apps you use at home like Netflix or Hulu.
There is a full size washer and dryer in a little nook off the living room, which we were happy to take advantage of to wash our sandy beach towels and bathing suits! Tim even provided laundry pods under the bathroom sink.
The location of this unit is perfect if you want to get out and explore Charleston on foot. Several times each day, the horse drawn carriage tours come down the street. It's a quick walk to King Street, if that's your thing. There is a beautiful little lake just about 2 blocks away, and you're very close to the waterfront for amazing sunset views. Queen Street Grocery is just a block away and is a great spot to pop in for breakfast or lunch to go. The off-street parking was easy to access, and we liked that our car was just outside the door so we could keep an eye on it. The area feels very safe, but I'm always wary of street parking.
The one tip I'd give anyone staying here is that the shower temperature is really tricky to get right. The first day I took a scalding hot shower because I could only get it to be either full blast hot or ice cold. By the second day, we figured out that if you leave both the rain shower head AND the shower wand on (use the knob to find the spot where they both are on as high as they'll go), you can get a good hot-but-not-scalding mix.
Overall this place is a 10/10 and I will DEFINITELY be back. If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Charleston, book this place now!"

Tim was great with recos but also totally gave us space to do our own thing. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone coming to Charleston for any length of time. We were there a week but could’ve stayed a month!! Such a restful place - a home away from home! Thank you so much Tim!"

The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on and Tim was always available in case we needed anything. We did have a bit of a difficult time getting the water temperature right in the shower, but Tim is so on top of things that I highly doubt this would be an issue for anyone in the future.

The apartment is very well appointed and the furniture and bedding were comfortable. The neighborhood is very quiet even though it's a short walk to the hustle and bustle of downtown.
Tim was always quick to respond to messages and reached out during our stay to make sure everything was going well and if we needed any recommendations. He was also very accommodating to a schedule change we had.
Altogether an amazing location and relaxing stay."

And amenities such as wine, snacks and toiletries for the guests. 163 Queen St is a great location surrounded by beautiful homes and gardens and easy access to shopping and restaurants. We will return for sure! Thank you Tim for being such a great host!"

Stayed a few nights","Where do I start? First off, Tim was an amazing host whose home exceeded our expectations in every way!!!
We had high expectations going into it, having read the dazzling reviews from other guests as well as the beautiful photos which can only tell you part of the story, and it did not disappoint!!!
Tim’s place was clean as a whistle, tastefully designed, and really smelled good too which is something my wife and I are big on!!! The house is really charming , having that “it” factor that is hard to capture, even with effort.
The kitchen was stocked with coffee (and condiments), snacks and both red and white wine! So much thought and consideration went into everything that was provided by Tim!
Lastly, Tim was able to provide my wife and I with amazing dining suggestions in Charleston which were on the money and really helped to steer us in the right direction!"

The owners (who live in the carriage house behind) were super friendly, fun and responsive, yet didn’t intrude on our privacy unless invited. Bonus … we got to visit with their adorable little dog, Sullivan. The neighborhood is adorable, with quaint old houses and beautiful gardens. Although the traffic is rather crazy around Charleston, we found it easy enough to navigate the area and lots of parking ramps in town. Would highly recommend this cute little house."

The house has it's own charm and unique flare. The beds are extremely comfortable! My favorite feature were the walk-in showers! The house is located towards the end of the neighborhood and was pretty quiet and calm. Jessie was super flexible and allowed us to rearrange the patio furniture to accommodate our family of 2 boys and a dog, which is awesome for anyone traveling with little ones. She was kind enough to recommend walkable parks in the area. The only thing to note, is that there is no direct access to the courtyard from the house, but its easy to walk through the gate. There are tons of walkable options for food, coffee and more."

Only thing that we were wrong in our assumption was the fenced in yard. We assumed the house opened up to the fenced yard but you have to exit the home and then go into the gate to the fenced area which is the owners front yard. But it still worked out for us and our pup, even got to use the black stone one night for amazing steaks in! We would definitely stay here again when we travel back to Charleston."

Stayed with a pet","The host did an unbelievable renovation on this home. Gorgeous interior, beautiful porch, luxurious features - fantastic bed, pillows, linens, glassware, etc - 5 star hotel worthy. Excellent communication and check in/out process. Very good neighborhood restaurants to explore - xbb and pink cactus. And a gorgeous park, Hampton park, to the north.
The considerations:
- You are 1+ mi from the traditional Charleston visitor sites, check your map closely or bring your walking shoes.
- The block is the last block before the neighborhood ends (into the highway), most homes on this block are not maintained like this one.
- The fenced backyard area pictured, with patio furniture, is where the host lives. They invite you to enter, but you’re basically sitting on their front stoop, so I did not feel comfortable. I thought I was booking a fenced backyard for my pup, but that’s actually their pups yard.
This may all be fine for you, but I wasn’t completely clear when I booked, so honest feedback. I prefer renting from hosts vs property companies, and top-notch dog-friendly places are hard to come by, so would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","A lovely house with tons of windows and natural light, beautifully renovated and with surprisingly awesome beds, pillows, sheets, and towels that, while usually an afterthought to me, absolutely made the experience more luxurious. The open floor plan with the freestanding fireplace and beautiful furnishings made the house just really fun to hang out in, and we enjoyed renting a movie through the Roku and watching it on the big screen.
Having two rooms with king sized beds, two full bathrooms and a nice kitchen for cooking meals at the house were a rare combination and made this a really easy, comfortable, low-stress trip for my husband and me, my parents and our two dogs. During the pandemic that’s worth a whole lot. To boot, I had just recovered from omicron and my isolation time threw off the whole trip, and Jessie was very accommodating and fair to find a solution for adjusting our dates a bit.
The house is in an especially convenient location if you have a car and want to visit beaches and other outlying areas, and as long as you like to walk (which is really my favorite thing to do in Charleston.) There are some great restaurants nearby too, and this is a nice quiet neighborhood street. We really enjoyed relaxing on the porches even though we didn’t have nearly the amount of time for it that I would have liked.
The back courtyard is especially great given the pandemic — reservations at places with spaced outdoor seating are hard to come by so we had to default to takeout a couple of times and having a nice place to eat it outside by the beautiful little orange trees and burbling fountain was much appreciated. I’ll also note that there isn’t a full dining table for 4 inside, just 3 seats each at the table and the island, but a full dining table is quite rare at this price point in the historic district anyway, especially in combination with multiple king sized beds. There’s just not space for that in most of these old houses, so having space for 4 outside was great.
Jessie was extremely responsive and helpful and shared some great restaurant recommendations. Overall a delightful experience and we hope to return soon."

Jessie did a great job with the decorations- the house was absolutely beautiful l. We even took some pictures of some of the decor to add to our own home. The house came fully stocked with appliances, utensils, and any cooking ware that you could think of. It was spotless and the bedding and towels smelled so clean. The neighborhood is located in a pretty central location to most of the main hotspots. Everything was within a couple of miles from the house. We would definitely go back and stay here."

Jessie and Robin were so accommodating to us and we were able to check in an hour early to make an early dinner reservation. We loved the cottage and decor! So nicely updated and chic. I couldn't have been happier with the shower water pressure, as well. It's the little things that really make for a great stay. I highly recommend this cottage for a great time in the city. Would use them again without reservation."

Nan's place was exactly as described and we had a wonderful time! It was so cozy and comfy and we had a lot of time to relax and chill as well.
The weather was up and down and it would be lovely to be here in the Spring/Summer/Fall & take advantage of the outdoor shower and the front porch to just chill and hang out.
We had the three of us there and were never without hot water, the beds were comfy and there were ample linens and towels for everyone.
The kitchen was stocked with everything you need to cook and there were also some snacks provided as well.
Great location and close to downtown, Folly and West Ashley. A short walk to beautiful parks and also to see the mini horses Stormy & Winnie down the road as well.
You will love this cottage and Nan is one of the nicest hosts we have met!! 10 Stars!!"

With a car, it was very easy to get to and around Charleston proper. Once we were acclimated, it seemed like it took very little time to get where we wanted to go. Coming from Seattle, I was very happy with the small amount of traffic and shockingly well-mannered and patient drivers around!

Stayed a few nights","Definitely agree with others that the cottage is even cuter in person. These are hosts that take a lot of care and pride in to making their Airbnb welcoming. From fresh flowers on the table to snacks and little cooking essentials like olive oil/salt/pepper they really thought about how to make the place feel warm. Very quiet neighborhood and a quick drive to downtown or the beach. We had to leave a day early because of Idalia and they even refunded us immediately without us even asking for it.
My tip for other guests is if you like firmer supportive pillows the ones there are perfect for you. If you like squishy down you’ll want to bring your own.
The owners are in this to be great hosts, not just make a big margin, and that is lovely to experience. You can confidently book."

Our host were very friendly and very helpful, but they also gave us our privacy.
We will definitely be staying here again, I will tell you make sure to bring bug repellent."

Stayed a few nights","The location was perfect, serene, and very homey and comfortable. Check-in was very easy, and the house had plenty of kitchen utensils/appliances/furnishings. There is a washing machine but no dryer (we assume because things are line dried), as well as an iron and ironing board. The only ""complaints"" we had were the bugs that managed to come out at night that closely resembled winged termites. They did fly into the sheets when we slept. Nan assured us they were not termites and they came out every spring. The beds are very comfortable and firm, but also loud if you move at all when you sleep. Other than keeping the bugs out, and noisy beds, the place was terrific. In the South Carolina heat and humidity the house stayed very cool and comfortable. We really enjoyed the porch furniture and scenery as well. The reviews that show Nan responds in about 2 hours is accurate. She also recommended a local park we could use for a family function that was *absolutely gorgeous*."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect little cottage in a fantastic location. It was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The neighborhood is quiet and the natural landscape is so peaceful and beautiful. We loved relaxing on the front porch early in the morning admiring the natural beauty surrounding us. Downtown Charleston is very close by, so this cottage is a perfect location for those who want a bit of peace and quiet while being just a short distance from all the tourist attractions. Nan and Mark were kind and courteous hosts and came by to introduce themselves and make sure we had everything we needed shortly after we arrived. If you’re looking to see the Charleston sights while enjoying the natural beauty and tranquility of South Carolina, I highly recommend staying at this lovely cottage. Thanks again for a perfect stay, Nan and Mark!"

Stayed one night","This little cottage in the woods is just off a quiet street and not far from a park and tennis courts. The vibe is nearly magical and the place exudes a wonderful peacefulness and feeling of welcome I haven't seen beat elsewhere. The cottage, with two bedrooms, cute sitting and dining area, a front porch, small side porch and galley-style kitchen is cozy and wonderfully decorated--you can see attention to detail and culture throughout. Nan and Mark are lovely and popped by to introduce themselves and let us know there were bikes at our disposal and that, if we needed anything, they were just the next house over. The island is packed with history--the thing we missed out on was exploring because Nan's place was only a brief stop along our path. We'll know better for next time!"

The person on site who cleans was most welcoming making sure I had everything I needed. I loved sitting out on the lovely porch enjoying a cup of great coffee. I would stay again. The only comment I have is that is about a half mile from King street where most of the shops are so I suggest you be comfortable walking. I walked there and back with no issues. It is a quiet neighborhood.

Group trip","This house was one of the nicest homes that I have stayed in but unfortunately we left exhausted due to the noise that kept us awake until 4am and then again due to the loading dock at the College which started at 7 am. (Note: it was College of Charleston graduation weekend. Other times of the year could be quieter). The city has a noise ordinance but what's the use in calling when the door to a bar and a dance club is within earshot. We did love the home and I am sorry to be writing a not so favorable review because Lisa has really put some effort into this home. Lot's of nice touches such as fluffy towels and nice kitchenware. The courtyard is perfection and the parking for 4 cars is a huge added benefit! But, we knew we were in trouble when we saw a noise machine, earplugs and fans in the bedrooms. The owners know it's a problem and I just wish they had given us a discount on the fee. This was not a cheap home to rent and we had elderly grandparents with us."

Group trip","Gorgeous Home/Perfect Location!
Home was perfect in every way. We were in town hosting our son’s wedding and stayed here for a week.
The 4 parking spots it offered came in handy and were very much appreciated.
Easy entry; safe area.
Enter to living room which is beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable, and very clean. Both dining room and kitchen were the same. Very roomy and well stocked with lovely furnishings. Outside courtyard was a bonus, it was both private and comfortable for our entire family to relax and enjoy together. All of the bedrooms were clean with extremely comfortable bedding and linens. And, the endless hot water was just wonderful!
Lisa thought of everything when stocking her home and the importance of making sure it was clean and comfortable for her guests is obvious.
This was an amazing rental. Better than we could have imagined. Oh, did I mention the location? Around the corner from Marion Square and walkable to everything downtown! Highly recommend."

Beautifully appointed without being fussy. Just a pleasure to live in for a few days. Lisa was a very responsive host, generous about check-in, check-out times when she could be. If/when we return to Charleston, this will be our go-to if available. We have a large family so we also rented Lisa's 2 bedroom cottage on the same property. I'll review that separately but it too met or exceeded all expectations."

The bathrooms were stocked with plush towels and great bath products. The house was described accurately and was even more lovely than expected. Perfect location. I highly recommend this house! Extra bonus was the awesome parking. So convenient.

We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful springtime Charleston weather. Ear plugs and sound machines were provided just in case the noise of the city might be an issue. It wasn't for us and we didn't need the ear plugs. Lisa has created a welcoming, classic home away from home."

Stayed with kids","We very much enjoyed our stay in this lovely, historic home! Everything was very clean, & the home was well furnished. There were excellent toiletries, fluffy white towels, and the beds are very comfortable.
The location is fantastic! Half a block from King Street, we were able to walk to Market Street, the Battery, and a variety of great restaurants & excellent shopping.
As a few reviews had mentioned, it was a bit loud on the weekend nights, but the sound machine provided allowed us to sleep well!
We definitely recommend this home, and Lisa (whom we met upon arrival & who gave us some great local recommendations) as a hostess. Can’t wait to visit again!!"

Group trip","Lisa’s home is exactly as published but better. Space was fantastic. Everyone had their own space that were guests plus the groomsmen for my sons wedding had plenty of space to ready themselves. Location was top notch, right in the middle of it all! Parking was a huge plus. She had waters, coffee, shampoo, soap, hairdryers plus everything you need to have a meal in. The carriage house was a huge plus for my brothers family so we had the entire compound. I recommend anyone looking for a rental in Charleston to consider this one, you will not be sorry! We will be back the next time we are in town. Lisa was super responsive leading up to our reservation even allowing us to check in 30 min early:). We never reached out to her during our stay but feel sure she would have been equally responsive. Great host, great space and great town. Thank you so much for sharing your space with our family for our special occasion."

Lisa was amazing, quick to respond to questions. A great hostess!

Group trip","We had a wonderful 5-night stay at 20 Burns Lane! It was the perfect home for my family to stay while we were in Charleston for our son's wedding festivities. I was originally concerned about the parking, but we never had a problem. We actually walked to most places. The location was perfect! It was so nice to have other family members (who were out walking around town) to pop in and visit for a while. I was impressed that EVERY INCH of the home was used to the max. Every bedroom had a bathroom, plus an extra half bath by the laundry room. The bathroom sinks were tiny, but efficient... and an amazing use of space! The make-up mirrors, sound machines, coffee maker AND Keurig, fluffy pillows, comfy beds, plus two luggage racks in each bedroom ...were all such nice extras that helped to keep this Mother of the Groom calm, cool and collected. We hated to leave and hope to visit again. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us."

Group trip","Greatest location available for a Charleston vacation! In the heart of Charleston just off King St. Walking distance to all the best restaurants and historic sites. We came to town for a Citadel homecoming weekend, walked and road bikes all over the city & had less than an 8 min Uber to campus. Right across the street from Marion Square, but tucked away where foot traffic is minimal. Lisa thought of every detail and then some. My wife and I stayed with two couples comfortably as we each had our own bath/shower. Each room has white noise machines and ear plugs plus fans and a fantastic air conditioning system! The courtyard was a house favorite for storing our bikes. The kitchen was perfect and had all we needed for several meals. The parking is tight for multiple full sized vehicles but we made it work with three full sized trucks and mid-size SUV. Lisa made check-in and check-out a breeze. Everything about this house and host was easy from beginning to end and in between! So grateful for Lisa and looking forward to our next visit. We’ll stay here for years to come!"

Stayed a few nights","We booked Lisa’s house for a girls trip and the house was perfect for our needs. We did not have a car, so choosing a location that was in walking distance to most things was important to us. The house is about 1 block from King Street, where shopping and restaurants can be found, and easy to get Ubers for trips out to the plantations and other site seeing.
There are several reviews that speak to the noise, and we knew that it could be noisy when we booked. Staying during the week after the college term probably made a difference as we only experienced limited noise from the bar across the way into the evening hours. More noise came from the garbage collection than anything else for us. But there are sound machines and ear plugs in the bedrooms should you need them.
The house is very well appointed with pretty much everything we needed. Comfortable bedrooms with very nice linens, duel system air conditioning (lower level and upper level) ceiling fans, outdoor enclosed area for breakfast or other meals. Lisa supplied a variety of kureg coffees, tea and creamers which made it easy for coffee at home, which was very lovely especially on our first morning. It's an old house so the bathrooms are small, but were fine for us, with plenty of towels.
Lisa was very helpful answering questions pre booking and during our stay. If I were traveling again to Charleston, with another couple I would not hesitate to book again."

Group trip","Absolutely stunning home in the heart of it all in Charleston. The home was sparkling clean and folks in our group said they had their best nights’ sleep ever on the comfy bedding. The location was absolutely perfect for all of our activities and Lisa was a dream to work with before, during and after our stay. The surrounding noise levels were a non-factor for us and everything was comfy and easily accessible. Will definitely book again."

If you are very sensitive to sound, there can be noise at night. It's in a lively downtown neighborhood. But this is completely out of the host's control. The trade-off is walking distance to shops, restaurants and the historic quarter!"

This 1802 brick home is a terrific home in the heart of Charleston. Lisa is a great host and did a great job decorating and outfitting this home for Airbnb guests. This home is very comfortable and perfect for three couples.
This is certainly one of the nicest Airbnb homes we have ever stayed in. We will definitely try to stay here again next time we are in Charleston."

Group trip","What a great house. It was so clean and nicely equipped for cooking or reheating . Our group of adults found the beds are very comfortable with good linens and towels. We were a short walk to King St. & other direction to Meeting St. Walked to shop, catch tours so almost didn’t need a car. Nice parking, too. ONLY downside is noise factor at night because you are surrounded by College of Charleston. Ear plugs and noise machines are provided. (This was college drop off week so students were probably rowdier than normal). Burns Alley Bar needs to comply with ordinances. Sound carries."

Group trip","Booking Lisas property was the best decision we made for our Charleston trip. It is located on Kings rd and you can literally walk anywhere. The only Ubers we took was to and from the airport. There is also private parking in front of the property should you choose to rent a vehicle. The home itself was charming, clean, and there was so much attention to detail. From ear plugs, to water bottles, to coffee all available to you. This home has so much charm in every corner you turn. Each bedroom had their own bathroom and an additional one on the main level. There is no keys necessary for this home, she will let you decide a four digit code, you and your party can use that code to enter the home. This is nice because you don’t have to worry about losing keys or if someone needs to return to the house they wont need to worry about who has the key in their possession, you can simply go and come as you please. The location is extremely safe, we were all girls on the trip and did not feel worried at all. Do not think twice booking this property, just do it now before its too late for you to experience this beautiful Charleston Colonial Home."

With city traffic often loud these extra amenities were helpful! The host was great at communicating with us and handling any questions! Very convenient location that includes 4 parking spots! We could walk everywhere- no Uber or taxi’s necessary. Well worth a little bit extra cost for the convenience and lovely home.

Stayed a few nights","This house is a wonderful place to stay if you are looking for a true “heart of Charleston” spot. Everything from historical sites to upscale shopping are within walking distance. The house is exactly the way it is presented by the host. It is beautiful and comfortable. And the host has thought of everything to make you feel welcome. From the Keurig coffee selection and the water bottles in the refrigerator to the board game selection, this house has it all. Check-in and communications were effortless and Lisa was quick to answer our questions (although we only had a few because instructions and helpful information were readily available throughout the home). She even provided sleep aids if you are not accustomed to city noises. But as previously stated, you are in the heart of where it is all happening in Charleston. My husband and I were there for 4 days with our daughter and son-in-law. Everyone had a great time and you will too if you visit Lisa’s charming home."

The only time we used a car was to visit Boone Hall outside of Charleston. Lisa has a decorators eye and each room is thoughtfully appointed especially notable are the luxurious bed and bath linens. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an exceptional Airbnb experience.

Group trip","If you need quiet to sleep, don't stay here, especially on a weekend (more on that later). The house is fantastically stocked, with plenty of plates and cutlery for 6, as well as cooking pots and some basic spices. The 3 bedrooms with en suite baths are great for 3 couples, and the courtyard makes an excellent addition for al fresco dining or visiting. Use of a washer and dryer was greatly appreciated by our group. Lots of towels were provided, and everything was sparkling clean.
As I mentioned at first, a major downside to the location (that the host can do nothing about) is the presence of a bar behind the house that plays loud music with a driving beat until 1-2am on weekends. Amazingly, it seemed that the sound /beat was amplified in the house, especially the bedrooms, in contrast to the living room in the house, or even the courtyard. You definitely need the earplugs and sound machine kindly provided by the host in each bedroom, to try and muffle the noise so you can sleep.
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay (only 1/2 block off of King!), but trying to get to sleep on Fri and Sat nights was a real issue. If not for the noise, this is definitely a 5 star stay! All restaurants we went to, were within 16-17 minutes walk, and we otherwise explored Charlestown completely on foot."

The interior of the home is just as described with plenty of room for everyone. The outside space includes an adorable courtyard for outdoor dining and parking which is so hard to find in Charleston. As disclosed, there is noise from nearby bars and clubs, but it was drowned out by the sound machine and ear plugs thoughtfully provided by our host. Overall a fantastic stay! Lisa is one of the best hosts I have encountered so far with Airbnb."

The house is near a nightclub so the weekend nights were loud. This is out of Lisa’s control, and she does ensure every room has fans, white noise machines, and ear plugs. So if you are a light sleeper beware if there in a weekend. If you are not a light sleeper then rent this house without hesitation, because it is otherwise fantastic."

Lots of nice touches such as coffee pods, hand sanitizer, fluffy towels, shampoo/conditioner in the showers. The only con is the noise - it's located off an alley, and we had garbage trucks with unbelievably loud beeping and banging at 2am on Friday and 4 am on Monday mornings. We were all woken up a various times throughout our 4 day stay. Clubs right nearby with loud music. There is a noise ordinance in place at 11pm so the bars/music shut down at that point, but the other activity did not. They do provide noise machines and earplugs, which helped some."

The kitchen is well-appointed and beautiful, with coffee, coffee-maker and Keureg with some starter cups available. The home is stylish and comfortable, and was spotless when we arrived. We were able to spread out to the 3 large bedrooms with their own attached full bathrooms and then were able to easily share the common area living room downstairs. The bedrooms and bathrooms have considerate special touches, such as hairdryers, shampoo & conditioner, soap, and extra towels. There are hand-sanitizer stations amply place throughout the house, and it is clean, clean, clean!

Not only was she quick to respond but was also very accommodating and great with communicating any details and needs with me, which was very helpful. The house was super clean and even had little ""sanitizing stations"" though-out which was a touch not overlooked. The little details throughout the home made for a very comfortable stay: games, 1st aid kits, sound machines in the bedrooms, stocked coffee, barware, local magazines & reads, etc...anything you could need Lisa had though through! The lay out of the home lended itself well to our small group as the central living room and kitchen are centralized for gathering yet the sleeping areas are spread apart and each contain their own bathroom which was key! The location was perfect and central to being able to walk to restaurants & shops. We barley had to get into our cars once we arrived.

There was a gorgeous bouquet of flowers on the kitchen counter upon my arrival. The house is on a quiet residential street, but within a half mile of Trader Joe’s, Walgreens, Whole Foods, and more. Plus there is an amazing coffee shop just down the road. Sean and Rebecca were kind to accommodate me on short notice. Such a wonderful stay!"

The home had everything we needed. We really appreciated the attention to detail, design of the home, fresh flowers upon our arrival, and ease of check-in and check-out. Sean and Rebecca were wonderful hosts. We'd love to come back sometime!"

Stayed with kids","The Treehouse is a private and delightful space that makes you feel like you’re staying with a family friend. Park right outside your door in a safe, residential neighborhood that is super easy to hop over the bridge to Charleston, Sullivan’s Island or IOP. A cooler, koozies, beach towels and beach chairs (on request) make you feel like a local on the beach. A walk-in closet with washer/dryer were icing on the cake. Thanks for the hospitality, Sean and Rebecca, we enjoyed your dining recommendations and links for things to do."

Very convenient for the wedding we attended downtown. Nice and spacious in the home, bed was comfortable and felt comfortable and homey. Communication was good from the owners as well. Since the stay is a bit more expensive than others, would have liked some additional amenities such as snacks, welcome basket, drinks, small toiletries etc. Only other comment would be that the check out process took a little longer than I would have liked with several specific instructions. Overall, very lovely stay and we appreciate the hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are planning a relaxing vacation (or work-vacation) for a couple like us, book Sean and Rebecca's *treehouse* without hesitation! We were thinking about staying in Charleston but many places were going to be loud at night. I can sleep through anything but my husband really wanted a quiet place where he can sleep well yet still close enough to the historic Charleston and restaurants. The treehouse perfectly fit the bill! Very clean (we do not wear shoes inside, and felt totally comfortable barefoot), quiet, and well-appointed, in a nice neighborhood. We biked to Trader Joe's and whole foods for grocery runs (Walgreens is also next-door) and visited Metto coffee every morning (6 minute walk). A quick Uber ride to Charleston ($10-15 Uber in Apr 2022) across the bridge made it very easy to plan each day. We would go for a run in the morning, get ready for the day in the Charleston, and return in the evening after dinner. There are also nice restaurants in Mt. Pleasant - Highly recommend Nico if you love oysters (FYI half-price oysters on Mondays). I am an over-packer, but did not need to do so because there was every amenity available in the treehouse: shampoo/conditioner, laundry detergent/dryer sheets, even cooking oils/sprays. Unexpected nice features: Filtered water and ice dispenser in the fridge and Netflix installed in the TV with a guest account (even though I have a netflix account, it was a nice touch). Internet is reasonably fast.
We biked around with the bikes Sean and Rebecca provided (with helmets), and on our last day we tried to bike to the sullivan Island (supposedly 25 minute ride). Oh well, the chain popped out as we were almost at the Island, so after trying to fix it unsuccessfully we ended up taking the bikes back in an Uber XL (a very nice driver to let us do that). It will be a story to laugh about for years to come! Rebecca was so sweet about it even though we should have known better not to take on an adventure like that.
There are steps to the Treehouse (the unit is built above a stand-alone garage, a brilliant idea) so if you have mobility issues it is something to keep in mind. I can see myself bringing kids here (we have two under 4) with a travel stroller, although the bed is pretty high so if your kid is a wild sleeper then I recommend bringing an inflatable toddler bed and/or pack-and-play.
Our flight out of Charleston was not until 6pm so we asked for a late check-out, and Sean and Rebecca kindly offered a 2pm checkout. Our stay was nothing but comfortable and relaxing from the beginning to the end. Can't wait to come back here!"

Stayed with kids","My husband, six month old baby, and I stayed here for a short two day trip while passing through on our way to Savannah. We have stayed in other listings in the Charleston area previously but Sean and Rebecca’s place was different in a great way. We enjoyed staying in the Mount Pleasant area for many reasons: 1. It is a quiet, safe neighborhood away from the often loud, chaotic downtown scene. 2. It is only a quick 5-10 minute drive into downtown Charleston which is accommodating. 3. We thoroughly enjoyed driving over the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge every time we went into Charleston!
Some standout characteristics:
+ so clean.
+ accommodating with essentials such as towels, soaps/shower supplies, laundry needs, etc.
+ gorgeous marble countertops and bathroom shower was large, and lovely!
+ easy check-in/out and good communication with hosts.
+ the place is close to MANY stores. Literally a Trader Joe’s one minute down the road.
A few things to consider before booking:
+ pretty small space however it is furnished in such a way that allows for as much room as possible.
+ bed is not the most comfortable. I understand this is just my opinion and it is arbitrary but I still feel like I needed to mention that.
+ the shades do not allow for full darkness in the bedroom at night. There was also a motion sensor light turned on at the main property that just clicked on and off all night which got to be a little annoying.
Overall, this place is a wonderful option for a couple or small family. Our daughter does not have much of an opinion of things yet, but she seemed to enjoy rolling around on the carpet in the living room. :)"

Only complaint was day of check in was informed there was a leak from adjoining unit that buckled up the flooring in the kitchen that had not been repaired yet which made it so you couldn’t close the bathroom door off the kitchen and even though we were made aware day of check in we both tripped over the buckled up boards a few times throughout the stay. Once the flooring is fixed it would be 5 stars all the way.
I would definitely return as long as the flooring was fixed."

We parked the car in the surface lot just one block away and did not drive it again until we left for Daniel Island. We easily spent the days we were there strolling the city and discovering other tasty places to eat seafood and beautiful boutiques to shop .
The loft is pristine, beautifully appointed and well stocked with all the things you need to make a stay free of issues. Comfortable bed, gorgeous bathrooms and the living room was a great place to relax on the couch each night after walking the day away.

Very appreciative with the attention to detail and amenities. Lacy & Jesse had a full coffee selection, iron + iron board, steamer, extra linens/towels, and pots and pans if you wanted to cook in the kitchen. The location was great and so close to some of the most famous Charleston areas such as Rainbow Row and The Battery. We were also within 15 min of walking distance to the most amazing restaurants. So lovely to be able to see Charleston and explore instead of driving through! The bed was so comfy and big. You can tell Lacy & Jesse takes pride in the space.
The only downfall is that the place does NOT come with a designated parking spot. Jesse suggested a few nearby garages that had a flat rate of $20/day so keep that in mind if you're looking to stay here. Despite that, I would definitely book my stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Couldn’t have been happier with Lacy’s place. My wife and I were down celebrating our 16th anniversary and we wanted to park upon arrival and just be able to walk everywhere. Lacy’s place was perfect for just that (parking garage is located a block towards the port). Located on East Bay near a ton of restaurants and galleries, the markets and a short walk to the battery etc. It couldn’t be more centrally located.
As for the house, it was perfect for the two of us. Kitchen was well equipped - though we never used it. Bed was comfortable. Wifi worked reliably. And the courtyard was always a welcome sight as we headed out for the day.
We would absolutely stay here again."

The only negative thing I'd say isn't with the property but with the Inn right next to it. The Lodge Alley Inn had some speakers on the back courtyard that played music at all hours. I'm not sure if they just forgot to turn it off at a certain point the nights we were there or if that's the standard but, you can hear it from inside the room."

Stayed a few nights","The loft was perfect! Immaculate, tastefully and beautifully decorated, well stocked with anything you might need, and located in the heart of downtown. We walked everywhere, finding some of the best restaurants and bars, waterfront park, and shopping. Jesse was a great communicator and made us feel so welcome :)
My husband and I are so glad we found this gem for our trip to Charleston!"
