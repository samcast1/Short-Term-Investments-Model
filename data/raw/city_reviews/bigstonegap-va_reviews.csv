Stayed a few nights","The place was bigger than I expected. The town of Big Stone Gap is rather quaint and the area around town is beautiful.
The only thing to be aware of with this stay is that it's right above a bar. they had live music on Saturday night, and it was loud enough to keep me awake. however, the food and microbrew beer downstairs were good enough to go when it was too loud upstairs."

Josh’s space a was prefect for a weekend away with my husband, we had everything we needed. On top of that, the space was easy to access, there was pleanty of street parking, and communication with Josh was easy.
I would definitely stay again!"

Big Cherry Brewing downstairs is fun and the burgers are awesome. Josh was thoughtful and left a dining coupon. The apartment was spacious and clean and beds were comfy. It was nice to have a full-size washer/dryer. The sofa is different/smaller than what was pictured but was fine for us. The tv in the living room is huge and great for football games! I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","The home is lovely, spacious. Though we were a party of two with our dog, I can see where a party of ten would have plenty of room (we only used the first floor). There are many 'old' touches that date to the period of the home. Beautiful wood floors with just the right amount of gentle creaking.
The yard had plenty of space for our dog to fetch his ball - his daily morning exercise routine. Loved having the cows close by and listening to their occasional bellowing. We appreciated that our dog was permitted.
The kitchen stove was not working properly, fortunately we ate out as was our plan. We had to contact Karen late one night, and she responded quickly answering our question."

The house isn't too far from Big Stone Gap which has so much to offer for a small town. Four Seasons Restaurant even delivers to the house! We enjoyed venturing into Big Stone Gap during the first part of the day and enjoying the home and all its coziness for the rest of the day. Everything was honestly so wonderful. Karen and her family did an amazing job restoring the home, and the decor was perfect.
The bathrooms were updated and clean. The beds were SO COMFORTABLE! The kitchen was updated but held some rustic charm. Will definitely try to stay here again if we ever find our way back to Big Stone Gap."

There is a ton of room. There is a railroad track that runs in front of the house, and two nights in a row a train did go by in the middle of the night and woke us up. However, I really like trains so it did not bother me. I just wanted to make mention of that as I did not see that in any reviews, or maybe I just missed it. The house was such a great place to stay, and our dogs enjoyed the large front yard to play fetch. We will definitely stay here again."

I particularly enjoyed reading the old articles and learning about the unique items in the home that had description tags placed on the item itself. The bedrooms were very cozy and spacious. The kitchen was packed with necessities that made our stay even easier. We woke up early each morning to a beautiful sunrise and spent lazy evenings on the front porch watching the children catch fireflies, playing a game if football or throwing a frisbee. This was the perfect place to connect with our family. We had space to spread out but plenty of space to eat our meals together. The children enjoyed watched the cows graze the fields and saw a deer a few times. On our last night the train came through and gave our extended weekend the perfect touch. Herbert & Karen were quick to respond and gave us our space to explore and enjoy. This home is well cared for and is the perfect place to witness the beauty of nature.

We had the opportunity to observe the farm in operation and loved hearing the rooster and the cows. The people working the farm were warm and welcoming to the children and enhanced their experience tenfold. The porch is a wonderful place to sit and watch the sunrise, the kids loved raking the leaves, and everyone enjoyed walking along the train tracks and exploring the area. This home is highly recommended and we look forward to staying here again."

Stayed with kids","We returned to Herbert and Karen's lovely home for a family reunion of sorts. It was perfect for a group of six adults and a child, and we loved spending time on the screened porch and playing board games at the table. The fall foliage was gorgeous this time of year, and it was so quiet and peaceful. The beds are so comfortable there, and this house is quickly becoming one of the places we know we'll return to for future trips. Herbert and Karen made so many thoughtful touches with the fall decor for the home, and provided great amenities for our stay, like hot cocoa, tea, and water. Come and stay at this house--you won't regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I were delighted to stay at this home to celebrate our six year wedding anniversary. We arrived to find an immaculately clean home with so many unique personal touches throughout to explore. This is truly a historic home, with many items that preserve the history of the area, and even family heirlooms. The hosts provided everything we could possibly need, including extra touches like a book about the restoration and repair of the home, and answered every question promptly. We enjoyed a few nights of watching spectacular sunsets from the screened in porch, and explored the property directly around the home on a beautiful foggy morning. The beds and furniture are so comfortable, and the area is quiet and peaceful. We loved watching the cows meander every day as we were coming and going. My husband and I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a flawless stay in VA, and we can't wait to return this fall! Thanks for all you did to make our weekend unforgettable Herbert and Karen!"

Stayed with kids","This gem of a home was recently remodeled and has a ton of character. The pictures don't do it justice. It's in a fairly remote location, though there's a dollar general within site of the house. It suited our purposes perfectly, as my family from Mississippi met me halfway from my Pennsylvania home. This house was a great home away from home for those who want a quaint old home in which to spend time together. The kitchen is outfitted with whatever you might need to cook, and the place was very clean and inviting. It was unfortunately quite cold during our stay, so we weren't able to take full advantage of the gracious porch or the grill, but this would be a great place to enjoy the outdoors. Highly recommend the Natural Tunnel State Park, which is about a 30 minute drive from here."

The large screened in porch was a favorite of our family, and having two full bathrooms was very appreciated. Karen was very responsive to our needs and questions, and had graciously prepared the house, stocking it with everything we could need.

Group trip","The place was wonderful. The house was gorgeous. All the kitchen things that you might need as well as water, coffee and tea and a grill outside was a nice bonus. A washer and dryer with detergent/dryer sheets. As well as toiletries in the bathroom if you forgot anything. The porch was wonderful to sit out at night time and there was plenty of yard space for the dogs to run around. Also, they have internet and cable which I don't think it shows online. Other great advantages was that the house feels very secluded but there is still a Dollar General within walking distance and a Walmart about 15 minutes away. It was a great getaway from Hurricane Irma!! Will come back in the future!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Back door and storm door were open. Host said maybe it had been open since cleaner was there 2-3 days ago. I felt unsafe & left immediately. She said she would check, called over an hour later. She blew off my concerns. Claimed there was no storm door. I cancelled without ever spending more than 5 minutes in the home. I got a hotel room. We received a refund of only 25% of our rental. I wrote her this was unfair and would shorten the time we could stay after my father in laws' funeral. Jennifer Johnson (host) continues to message and harass me. She rudely remarked:
""And it’s also odd that I knocked your husband out of spending time at his father’s gravesite but you just arrived in time for the funeral. Was he already buried? Late this evening?"" WHO TALKS TO A GRIEVING FAMILY THIS WAY? No respect, no business decorum, and apparently no conscience. I would not deal with her again for any reason. She kept the money and I just want her to stop messaging me!"

I had a couple of questions throughout the weekend, and she was very prompt in responding. The kitchen was great, and we made coffee every morning. Also enjoyed the living/TV room, and a cozy sectional with two automatic recliners. We definitely want to stay again. Very reasonable. Thanks, Jennifer, for a great weekend."

Stayed with a pet","The place was just as described and pictured! As the pictures clearly show, there are a lot of stairs leading to the house. It's a steeper incline with somewhat limited handrails leading to the house - just something to be mindful of if you have knee or stability issues. The house was very clean, and we felt very safe in the peaceful, quiet neighborhood. We discovered the town by chance when searching for a last-minute place to stay for another event. The town is very cute and has a lot of charm. The scenery is beautiful, and we, of course, had to check out the ""Woodbooger."" You are close to some local restaurants as well as a fast food option and pharmacy - all easily walkable with nice well-lit sidewalks. It's about a 10-minute drive to larger stores like Walmart should you need anything else. Jennifer was very friendly and quick to respond. We really enjoyed our stay at the house and the town!"

Stayed a few nights","Norton was my father's home town and my parents, as well as a sister, are at the Highlands Cemetery in Norton. We try NOT to stay in hotels when travelling. We use to stay at what was the Holiday Inn and the last visit, pre-COVID, it was going down hill. We found Jennifer's place and were excited to give it a shot.
We loved it! No issues at all. It was clean and had everything we needed. Very important to us is good mattresses on the beds. We had good nights of sleeping and woke up with no back aches. BIG PLUS! Shower had very good water pressure!
I had my doubts about the AC units but were impressed at how well they work. It was a WARM weekend.
Location was great for walking to the restaraunts. Food City and Walmart are a short drive away.
Stairs could be a challenge fo some but we had no issues with them. Knowing the landscape of the area it is what we expected.
All in all a great AirNB and highly recommend. We would not hesitate to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","It was an awesome experience being in Norton, VA for the July 4th weekend. Giant American flags hanging all over Main Street. The town had a parade with fireworks that were amazing. You could walk out the back door and sit and watch the fireworks very clearly. The house stayed cool while we were out during the day so it was great to come back and rest. We went to Wood Boogers grill which was awesome! Visited Flag Rock which was an amazing and beautiful overlook. Main Street is loaded with shops and beautiful to walk. Everyone in this are was so nice and welcoming. We met several neighbors and enjoyed talking with them. We got to see several coal operations which the kids thought were awesome. The house could have been cleaner, there were black hairs in the tub after the first shower I took, and I have blonde hair. When I went to make coffee the first morning we were there, a dirty used coffee filter and grounds were still in the pot. I also found used deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, and a brush with hair in it left in a drawer in the bathroom…. It definitely was not ours. They provided Olay soap in an unopened box, however shampoo and conditioner were in bulk bottles in the shower, so several people have used them prior to us. I did bring my own. There were condiments and food others had left behind in the cabinets and the coffee provided was in a huge foldgers plastic tub that who knows how many people have put there hands in. I just went and ordered online grocery pick up from Walmart about 10 min away versus using what was there. The couch is amazingly comfortable! Like where can I buy one just like it? It was awesome to sit on the front porch and just enjoy coffee or a drink after supper. The house is located on a pretty steep hill and there are several steps to get up to the house. One of the steps that have been redone is loose so you just have to be careful. The backyard is nice, easiest to access from the second floor where there is a walk out right into the back yard. The house has that old mountain town charm. Norton was like stepping back 20 years, even the prices on things, except gas lol. The fast food joints were even super nice! Being from the Richmond area it was so nice lol. I would 100% come back and stay in the house for the 4th of July weekend! Tons of outdoor stuff to do around the area. Only 30 min or so to Kentucky and Tennessee. Cheaper than any hotel and you have all the amenities of home."

Stayed with kids","Jennifers house was the perfect spot for our visit. We had plenty of room for our family of 4, and the house had everything you could need to be comfortable during the stay (included cleaning supplies, dish and dishwasher soap, paper towels, toilet paper, etc) and the gas fire place in the living room was lovely. the kitchen was recently updated and it was perfect for cooking meals at the house. My only warnings are that you need to park on the street and there are quite a lot of stairs to enter the home. Not a problem for us, but could be for some. Also, the home was heated by a room heater in the dining room and upstairs hallway. Therefore the bathrooms were quite chilly, and the bedrooms were cold unless you warmed them up by leaving the doors open during the day to warm up the rooms. The master bedroom was a bit chillier than the 2nd bedroom. But, overall a great stay and we would definitely stay here again for our next visit to town."

The only word of caution I would provide is that since only street parking is available, you must enter and exit through the front using the stairs in the photos which might be a challenge for anyone with a mobility issue. The backyard is also a very steep hill so do not plan on any COVID friendly outdoor gatherings. Otherwise, this is a lovely home. We will book this again next time we are in town!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my first Airbnb. My son was graduating from HS and I needed a place for family to stay. Communication with was great and very comfortable. It felt more like communicating with a friend. One of the reasons I selected this house was because it seemed bright. It really was! This was well lit, bright and cheerful. It was very open allowing many family things simultaneously. If someone was working in the kitchen they were still a part of the other things in the house, especially the family conversations.
Everything was very clean. The information shared with us made it easy to locate blankets and pillows when my daughter surprised us. The kitchen had everything we needed for our quick weekend. I liked the two tables in the kitchen area. There was lots of counter space and the extra table made a nice place to set things like the cake and without losing game space.
The views from all directions were wonderful especially watching the mist rise in the morning."

We had lots of greenery to see, birds chirping, cows and steers grazing in the expansive pastures, as well as all the dogs and the cutest puppies ever. The horses, sheep, and chickens, oh my!!!! And then we saw the very private guesthouse with 2 large decks and a smaller deck, set up with rockers, a swing, and a gas grill along with a fire pit. The serenity was outstanding!!! Our host, Edee, was the most gracious and friendly person, making sure several times checking on us that all was in order and if we needed anything at all and referred us to eateries in the area. The guesthouse was in pristine condition, very clean and inviting, a comfortable home away from home!!! Myself and my party of 4 others loved it and we enjoyed our stay immensely!!! Two people in my party were handicapped and in scooters, Edee made sure there was a ramp in place for them to get in and everything else was accessible!!"

Edee left us fresh muffins from a local bakery as a small welcome that were to die for! We went into town, Big Stone, which was a straight shot ten minutes up there road and had everything we needed. The property itself is honestly unbelievable in the best way! We were mesmerized by the animals every morning and all agreed how peaceful and at home we felt. Until next year, we will definitely be looking forward to our next stay! Book it!"

There were fresh muffins and flowers in the home for us when we arrived. We have a three year old and we were very comfortable with him moving around the house and grounds safely. The animals that were on the property were awesome and we fed the horses apples from apple trees in the yard. The nearby town of Big Stone Gap was fun to walk around with a cute pottery shop and coffee shop, among other shops and restaurants.
This is a great location for hiking at Devil’s Bathtub and Breaks Interstate Park- both of which we did during our stay. Having a washer and dryer was great for after hikes so we weren’t lugging home a mess of laundry.
Edee sent us home with homemade apple butter and so much kindness. We will definitely stay here again on our adventures!"

The house and area are very neat and clean, and all modern amenities. Spotless and very fresh smelling. Lots of natural light through the expansive windows, but effective shades if you'd like to sleep in. Handy decks around the house for relaxing.
While winding down after the trip and funeral, we really enjoyed some naked eye stargazing from the front deck. Saw the Big Dipper, Sagittarius, the Scorpion, the Northern Cross, the International Space Station, some satellites, and even a great view of the summer Milky Way.
While the facilities were great, Edee really made the stay outstanding! She was very helpful to make our hectic trip and events work out, and very friendly and pleasant to work with. This was greatly appreciated, as it was a very stressful time. Great visit, and we hope to stay again."

As mentioned from a previous guest, the drive up is steep-so be prepared for that. I was thankful that I hadn’t driven my standard shift Mini Cooper. However, you don’t need a 4 wheel drive. I made it up in a sedan- slow and easy is the trick.
Once arriving, two days were not long enough- we could have easily stayed a week. The “Retreat” is spotless, lovely and comfortable from the soak in the tub to the foam top mattresses. We also had excellent internet service.
The Owner has truly put a lot of thought into the decor and making it a special place for his guests.
Thank you so much for making our bittersweet weekend not so bitter."

I would definitely stay here again, next time for a little bit more R&R than I got this time around as we were there for my wedding and all the last-minute preparations. The property is very serene and I enjoyed walking down to the river. All kinds of little wildlife to observe, as well as seeing some deer.
Privacy: the only room with blinds on the windows was the Main Bedroom, and while an extremely secluded and private location, having blinds in the main living area or bathroom (especially) would've been nice. Amenities: While well stocked with the basics, didn't have much beyond that, measuring cups, but no measuring spoons, only two rolls of toilet paper and one paper towel roll for the week, etc. So we had to purchase/bring several items.
The host did a great job checking in on us, and ensuring our stay went smooth."

The beds were all very comfortable and we were pleased with how the kitchen was stocked. Had a wonderful hike nearby at Natural Tunnel state park.
A few things to note - there is only one mirror in the entire place which is in the bathroom and is hung too high for a child or shorter adult to see themselves. Also, there IS heat and hot water, which we noticed were not mentioned in the listing but thankfully the house does have. Lastly, the last portion of the gravel driveway may not be suitable for small cars. The steep gravel road had deep ruts and we could feel the gravel in the middle of the road scraping the bottom of the car. Driving an SUV would be advised!"

Stayed about a week","I’ve enjoyed many mountain, beach, and city rentals. This one now tops the list by far. Spent seven memory-making days and nights in this mountain paradise. The home was perfect. Beautiful, pristinely clean, peaceful, comfortable, and cozy. Kitchen is modern, functional, and well-equipped. Dining area was spacious and convenient. Bathroom is the most attractive and pleasing I’ve experienced in a rental. Bedroom was comfortable and spacious. Good closet space. Living room was very relaxing. The large windows and surrounding gorgeous scenery made for the most extraordinary comfort. Back deck is long, wide, and attractive. The acreage is beautifully maintained and wildlife was plentiful every morning. I was sad to leave this little piece of heaven. Cannot wait to enjoy the sweet country life in this beautiful home again soon!"

Stayed a few nights",My wife and I was looking for a quiet place with beautiful views. The place was that and more. I found the walking trail to a nice spot on the river. We had turkey and deer in the backyard one afternoon. My wife loved the house. We would definitely come back again. I will say the road coming to the house made me feel lost but it was marked. I thought we were trespassing on someone’s farm. We kept following the green arrows til we arrived.

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful home in a very private spot - perfect place to get away to reset. Very nice linens and amenities. The coffee pods were a nice touch. Kitchen utensils only included the bare minimum - no baking dishes or sheet pans. The driveway is best navigated by a vehicle that does not sit low to the ground, although 4WD is not necessary. It's very peaceful to sit on the porch and watch for wildlife or the neighbor dog to come visit. A few low-key places to visit within 10 min drive. Would definitely recommend this spot and would love to visit again."

Stayed with a pet","Alicia's place was as described, charming , comfortable and you felt like you were at your grandmothers home in the country. The neighbor had ducks and chickens, dogs and cats and they wondered but were not intrusive but entertaining. If you are looking for a modern home with sterile, sleek monochromatic this is not for you. But if you are comfortable with being at your grandmothers and feeling that homey, welcoming feeling you will enjoy her property. I will tell you Alicia is still updating and doing work on the property but nothing that would affect your stay. The property is located in a great location. Natural Tunnel is almost across the road, Cumberland Gap is a short drive and incredibly beautiful, the history that surrounds that location will give you constantly something to do. Our stay was perfect for what we were there for and if invited we will be back"

The home was so comfortable and welcoming that even my husband who doesn’t like to stay in places that are not home, found himself settling in and saying that he couldn’t wait for another visit back. There is so much thoughtfulness incorporated in “Mamaw’s house” like the dirt table to plant flowers, stocked craft area, Epsom salts for the bath, DVDs, board games, bird seed to feed birds, a relaxing outdoor fireplace with marshmallow roasting sticks, and really so much more. The home was decorated for the holidays with vintage decorations that really went well with the theme. She asked which direction we were traveling from and gave us excellent restaurant suggestions along the way as well as local events that we could check out. It really reminded me of visiting a Hallmark style home and town! Highly recommend!"

I am so glad we didn't stay at a hotel, our time was not long enough-three nights. There are so many thoughtful and unique touches that make this house so incredibly special. You can paint, draw, feed the birds, sit on the beautiful porch, build a fire in the fire pit, plant, create in the rock garden and so much more. The decor is unquestionably my favorite of all Airbnb/VRBO houses/condos I have stayed in. So much attention to detail, and I just found myself taking it in. We arrived to farm fresh eggs, little debbie cakes and immediate comfort. The house was clean, beds comfortable and Alicia has thought of everything- hats, backpacks, local information, a coupon for the state park. Seriously I could just go on and on. Communication was top notch, and I already wanna come back to this peaceful paradise!"

I was able to do some of those things because the weather did not cooperate every day. The cottage was clean as a pin. There was a grocery near and anything I needed was close by. The electric went out for awhile, but I am an adult and know those things happen when you have a storm. Alicia, the host, came over and provided me with flashlights and solar lights so I didn't have any trouble adjusting to the circumstances. I wasn't far from the cemeteries that I waned to visit and leave flowers and not too far from Gate City where I visited an antigue store.
I was by myself and was very comfortable. I like being able to do my own cooking, or not. I would call on this ABNB again

I was glad that we got to stay in a house like this where I grew up so my daughter could see how peaceful and slow things are there. The house contained antiques and things that I remember from growing up there including the cows (they were outside though). I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants a taste of the country life and a true escape from the real world. I stayed in the master bedroom and it was extremely soft. I slept like a brick! Thanks for the hospitality Harold. This is a true hidden gem! I hope I can visit again sometime.

Harold was easy to get in touch with for checking in. We did not have any issues so there was no other reason to contact him but if there had been I’m sure he would have been very accommodating. I highly recommend both the place and the host."

We loved waking up to the cows mooing outside of our window. No light pollution from the city, it’s nice and dark at night. This house was beautiful and felt like a home. It has been well cared for, and it shows. My wife and I fell in love with the property.
Harold was very responsive, between his home and his communication this was our best Airbnb experience we have ever had."

The furnishings are absolutely beautiful and the entire house is full of charm.. We loved the mixture of antiques and special pieces that made the entire house so welcoming.
Our host, Harold, could not have been any nicer. He was immediately available for any questions we had, and his personality is perfect for a host. He was very welcoming, and combined with a beautiful home made our stay such a pleasure. We are already planning another trip to The Home Place."

The only problem we had was the back bedroom and bathroom (where we stayed) was colder than the rest of the house. We took advantage of the extra blankets but ended up both sleeping with socks on due to being cold. We left on Saturday evening rather than Sunday. Not because house but because my husband wanted to go back home for his family Christmas.
Thank you for the wonderful hospitality!"

A lot of times, the rules for a rental are a mile long and it feels like you are walking on eggshells to make sure everything is perfect... but it didn't feel that way here. We felt welcome. We felt comfortable. We had great nights of sleep. The house has everything you could need. My only complaint, and it may have been because I couldn't find it, but we only had 2 rolls of toilet paper. I couldn't find any extra under the vanity. But, no big deal. We went and bought some down the road, as stores are very close.
We will definitely visit again when we come down to see family.
Thanks for a great experience!"

Group trip","Serenity Meadows, a name given that fits perfectly for it's private, calmn, peaceful location with a country living feel, but close to restaurants, stores & shopping should you need to run into ""town"". This home offers lots of great space for any size families. Clean, cozy, organized & well stocked. The gas grill & fire pit are wonderful & thoughtful little extra amenities. House had everything we needed. We love the country & Serenity Meadows truly made our visit relaxing & rejuvenating. Checking in & out was very easy and convenient. Denver was a great communicator and responsive. We really enjoyed our stay and will book again when the time allows. Would highly recommend Serenity Meadows, especially if you want to get away from all the hustle and bustle. We appreciate Denver hosting our family!"

I don't see that well at night, especially in the country, just be aware of the entrance is straight off Rock Bar road. once I figured it out, it's really easy. My mom and I found the home to be super cozy, and comfortable. The beds are so comfortable we slept so well! Will definitely stay again next time I'm in Wise! Thank you for the kind hospitality Denver!"

Stayed over a week","Beware, of not cleaning the grill, even though there is no grill cleaning tools. It will cost you 20 dollars, after you use the grill for 15 mins, the gas will run out. You call the host, he graciously offers to refil the gas but you must replace the tank yourself. Then you get a request to pay a 20 dollar grill cleaning fee. Bring your own toilet paper. 2 rolls per toilet for a 2 week stay.
Bring your own trash bags, 2 kitchen trash bags left for a 2 week stay.
The place is as described. It is very dated, the main big living room, furniture is completely worn out. The nice big screen tv has no remote. The den tv near the kitchen is fine. The host is friendly while communicating during the stay. But doesn't hesitate to hit you for a 20 buck grill cleaning fee, even though there is no cleaning utensils for the grill, he mentions taking apart the grill and spraying with a hose. Not a lot of options for houses around,host may want to just include his grill ""cleaning"" fee into theprice"

My Daughter, Grand-daughter and Son-in-law live in the area and we had a great visit with them. The home has wonderful amenities, outdoor living, grill, fire-pit and more. We didn't have a chance to take advantage of the fire-pit and grill this visit, but we'll be back to stay here in the future.
Our visit included a day-trip to Natural Tunnel state park, 30 minutes or so south, well worth your time if you get an opportunity to go.
Thanks so much Denver, we can't wait to come back."

One thing to keep in mind in booking here is that while you the place is advertised both by the room and as an “entire home,” someone lives in the basement. This was my fourth or fifth stay and it was as lovely as always.

The house is clearly a home, with lots of family photos spread throughout the house, and the owners’ food in the refrigerator. The instructions left in the house were very clear and easy to follow. Betsy and Art were not there during our stay so we did not have the opportunity to enjoy Betsy’s cooking which was mentioned in many of the reviews. They did offer for one of the neighbors to make breakfast but it felt unnecessary to have someone cook for just the two of us when we could just go the local coffee shop."

That’s the first thing that comes to mind after staying at this house! The house itself was so beautiful, extremely clean, The pictures do not truly give this place the justice it deserves! Finding it was a treat in its self to… we drove in from Ohio so by the time we arrived in Lynch we were excited as you can imagine after being on the road all day.. you go through a quaint little town at least the way we came ( or a winding whimsical Road) and then up on a hill sits this Magical home it feels like it’s welcoming you from the minute you pull in the driveway! But honestly that wasn’t even the best part Dave and his wife The sweetest neighbors ever made us feel like we had known them forever, Amazing food, great conversation and knowledge!

This trip, it was only four of us, but when we return, we hope to bring grandkids and sons-in-laws, who loved our previous stay. Venturing out, some of us went to Lilley Cornett Woods, as well as to Appalachia, VA where they saw a bear.

Seven adult members of our family stayed there and four of us stayed nearby, gathered there for meals, playing games, rendezvousing to set off on our sightseeing ventures. I highly recommend families or friends consider doing the same. We ranged in ages from 10 to 76, and everyone loved the beauty of the mountains, the hikes, cultural sites (Benham Mining Museum, Portal 31, AppalShop), the Little Shepherd Trail, Kingdom Come State Park, and Lilley Cornett Woods. So much to do! We hope to return and hike Blanton Forest and bike along the old railroad bed - and get more delicious barbecue and doughnuts from the food truck, coffee and pastries from the Lamphouse Coffee Shop, and try some of the cute restaurants, shop at the neat shops....as I said, so much to do!"

Stayed about a week","We got to ride on some of the best roads in the East. Twisty curvy mountain roads with little traffic and great pavement. The house was exactly as described and taken care of. The amenities of having breakfast provided each morning was an EXCELLENT value and a great time saver for our group. It allowed us to get on the road earlier and spend more time on some well kept roads in the area. Quiet, Secluded and off the beaten path on a newly paved highway made this a great place for our group to get together and relax for the week."

Stayed with kids",A beautiful private setting in a very small town in the middle of the mountains. The views from the mountain tops coming in are phenomenal! If you decide to go out to dinner in the evening and go off the mountain make sure to be back before dark because those mountain roads coming in from Virginia are tough to navigate in the dark.

Stayed with kids","Lovely, quiet place to stay, we absolutely loved it. Nanci was great and the breakfasts were super tasty. We enjoyed just hanging out at the house when we needed down time. All the places we wanted to visit were within, reasonable to us, driving distance. If we want to take a day trip we highly recommend Cumberland Falls State Park to see the waterfall and from there heading the half hour to Yahoo Falls. When you get to the top of Yahoo Falls keep following the trail to the left and it brings you down to the actual falls with a water hole that has the most amazing rock cavern. We spent a good hour there with kids. Definitely worth it! We are already talking about coming back to visit some other places that looked interesting. I would say between the fabulous hospitality and gorgeous scenery this was one of my best ever vacations. Thanks again and can’t wait to come back!"

We enjoyed sitting on the patio in the morning with our coffee, listening to Looney Creek & watching the birds!"

Stayed a few nights","To anyone who is considering a Bed and Breakfast in the LYNCH, Kentucky area you would be hard pressed to find a finer place to stay than: TRANQUILITY IN THE MOUNTAINS. Not only would meet the finest hostess of a wonderful and Happy Home, well located between Green Mountain and Black Mountain. There are beautiful views and vistas from several vantage points near by. Lynch is a Historic town that was engineered and built by UNITED STATES STEEL CORP, in early 1900's. Almost all homes there were built by USS for the employees of the corporation from the Project Manager right down to the lowliest miner. The entire project was engineered and built and maintained by USS for the benefit of the Corporation and it's employees. Homes, Businesses, Company Stores, Churches, Library, Schools, Athletic Facilities/Fields, Hospital and Medical offices and the last to let you down; The Mortuary.
The area is called; ""The Three City area,"" The Three Cities being Cumberland, Benham and Lynch.
The mining companies hired tradesmen from world-wide locations. There were English, African, German, Italian, Portuguese, Asian, Central and South America natives. Families, Married couples, Singles. The Company even Hired and Maintained their own Police Department, their own Fire Department. There was lots of activity in that small area and much of the work was unseen.
There are some sites worth seeing relative to the Coal Companies. There's a Museum, Portal 31 a Mine site and there are Guided excursions and tours available there.
If that's not your cup of Tea you can always sit on the Covered Patio at Tranquility in The Mountains and just enjoy the peaceful solitude while listening to the babbling creek and watching the abundant wildlife."

Stayed with kids","One of our best vacation rental stays we have experienced. Lynch, Cumberland, and Benham - the tri-town area near the rental, has about 2000 people in all. It was a very interesting exploration through the smallest of towns. Highly recommend visiting Portal 31 about a mile down the road, one of the largest mines in the US; and Nick, the director is very accommodating and friendly. I recommend calling them in advance and leaving a voicemail to arrange a ""disney-like"" tram-tour through the mine. The free breakfast every morning made by Nanci was an amazing touch you don't see anymore in the hospitality world. When you walk outside, you can just hear the creek, the breeze, the trees in the wind; it is just a beautiful tranquil getaway and well worth the visit. To get there you will be driving over a steep winding mountain from either side (from the west is an easier drive). The house has 4 separate bedrooms for privacy, just one TV (with many of the services - Directv, netflix, disney plus, hulu, etc), fireplace, fully stocked kitchen, 3.5 bathrooms (2 private, 1 jack and jill, and 1 guest without shower/bath). All in all, highly recommended stay and excellent value."

The location in the mountains was actual tranquility. The towns close by were amazing and we very much enjoyed ice cream at the Dairy Hut each day after exploring. My oldest daughter and I even found some cool trails right across the street that gave us breathtaking views of the waterfalls. On top of all this, the place was sparkly clean, the fridge was stocked with water for our daily adventures, coffee each morning was delicious, and there was plenty of space for our family of 6! It was my favorite AirBnB to date! Thank you for such an amazing visit!"

We all had a bedroom and there’s plenty of room in the house for quiet time to read or have a private phone conversation. The breakfast was amazing! Try to have just one biscuit, I don’t believe it’s possible! The location is as peaceful as it gets. We spent the mornings sipping amazing coffee on the covered patio as we listened to the creek. We spent the evenings on the patio as well. The place is named “Tranquility In The Mountains” and is definitely named appropriately. We hope to go back for a stay next year!"

We spent three very enjoyable nights here, filling our time with everything from butterfly watching from the large porch to touring across the mountains into Virginia.

There is a small stream nearby and a variety of plant life for folks like us who enjoy exploring. The trip to the house was real bonus, as we would have likely never driven up the mountain to find the many overlooks in the high elevations. Beautiful, never-ending sea of mountains that blend into the sky that make for great photos all to be found in the area."

Stayed a few nights","It was my second staycation at the cabin. It is everything you could want and more. We enjoyed early morning coffee on the front porch swing & rocking chairs while listening to the running creek, watching a couple of bunnies in the yard, a deer passing by, the faint sound of a woodpecker, beautiful song birds and a hummingbird enjoying the flowers right in front of you. Then late in the evening, roasting marshmallows for s’mores at the ready to start fire pit. Went out during the day to enjoy the picturesque mtn views nearby. The cabin is very clean and cutely decorated. It’s spacious enough to have privacy, yet cozy enough to enjoy family. Plenty of cookware to make meals and colorful dishes to enjoy it on. Everything needed for cleanup. Huge dining room table to enjoy your meals together, as well as game time after. Felt so blessed to be at a place that felt like home away from home. The neighborhood is pleasant and makes you feel safe, without being crowded. Highly recommend!"

There’s even a thrift shop over the bridge that all the proceeds go towards helping the small community of Eolia. Amy was an incredible host and extremely responsive to anything we needed.

The house was clean but could be little cleaner such as the tub and showers. But no sign of any bugs and that’s what really matters lol There is also a lot of wasp swarming the outside and twice had to get them out of the house. The very bare minimum of stuff provided, but lots of cabinet space for you to bring stuff. Overall great stay, great price, great communication. We seen a wild turkey with three babies in the field behind us but no other wild animals at the house. We did see a bear and three cubs as well when we were out hiking in the surrounding towns. We had a great stay. Thank you for providing this house for us! Would definitely return!"

Stayed about a week","We travelled here from Minnesota to visit family and study family geneology. This location was in the middle of our paths to Letcher County Kentucky and Wise County Virginia. It was a lovely time experiencing the spring season in this area, which is earlier than ours! The home was clean and dust free, if you have allergies. No carpets, only wood floors and a few rugs. The kitchen was well stocked and all the appliances worked well. The porch and fireside chairs outside were idyllic and restful, with an abundance of birds singing and a babbling brook running alongside the property! We were happy to have found this restful home, after our days of visiting relatives, searching cemeteries, and researching records in nearby towns. This is the area of past generations, and a rural home experience in the vicinity of family roots was perfect.
Communication was complete and easy, we had no issues. There is a small general store nearby that provided what little items we needed, take out sandwiches for picnicking, and a few gifts for grandchildren and friends. We appreciate some flexibility in scheduling, since we needed to add another day to our stay here. Since this was our first stay with an Airbnb, we will be happy to use this again."

Beautiful, clean spot to get away from it all. I will be recommending this spot if friends are looking for a get away— family or romantic!"

Stayed with kids","This was the 4th stay and I’m always amazed each time we book here. Extremely clean and roomy cabin for our family of 3. The colors of fall were present in every direction and the views are breathtaking! We never eat out while staying here because the kitchen is equipped with absolutely everything you need. We enjoyed paddle boating and hiking at Kingdom Come State Park, Little Shepard’s Trail, the Coal museum and Black Mountain Thunder zip line. All of these attractions are very close to the cabin. Mark and Amy are gracious as always and the best hosts ever. Book this cabin y’all, you won’t be sorry."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely wonderful stay! I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Very comfortable, felt just like home. The view from the house was beautiful, the little town was perfect! Not to mention, the store up front, was so neat! Found several goodies to take back home and in walking distance to the house. Owners of the house were very welcoming, and friendly. Made a few stops at local parks around the area and met several people in the community. Enjoyed swinging on the porch listening to the creek and watching the deer. We had a family of 4 with one who has a walker/wheelchair, accommodated everyone very well! Walk-in shower was great, along with the ramp, both allowed easy access. Kitchen was full size and well equipped with cooking supplies, enjoyed being able to stock up on groceries and cook dinner, made it very comfortable. Overall, the house was very clean, well kept in/out and included plenty of parking outside. Highly suggest booking this house for your next family vacation!!"

Stayed a few nights","Me and my wife stayed here for our anniversary. We were looking for a quiet place to get away and we were not disappointed. The cabin was beautiful and a joy to stay in. If you like hiking like we do, there are a number of trails near by that you can take advantage of. This is also a great place if you like wild life as our first morning we were treated to a black bear on the property. Check in and check out could not be simpler. We will most likely return in the near future."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place to get away from it all, relax, connect with nature, and recharge this is the rental for you. I was coming to town from Texas and Mark was exceptionally easy to plan arrangements with, by rapidly responding to every message I sent. The location is perfectly placed with stunning mountain views from the front porch swing. You can hear the creek running alongside the property and there's easy access if you want to dip your toes. The pictures do not do this rental justice. It comes well equipped with everything you need for a short weekend away or a vacation. I would recommend this for Couples, families-- Easily accommodating both small and large. I was in town for a few days for funeral, an emotional time, and this was a nice place to come ""home"" to each evening."

Stayed a few nights","Mark and Amy were amazing hosts that set the bar for other AirBnB hosts. There hospitality and generousity went above and beyond. The cabin was spotless and has everything you could possibly need for your stay. No details are overlooked , from firewood for the fire pit to clean towels and washcloths in the bathroom and kitchen. Mark and Amy were always available if you needed anything or to answer our questions. The location offers solitude while being close enough to many state parks with amazing wildlife and waterfalls. My wife and I wish we could have stayed on the front porch swing forever. We can't wait to visit again and won't hesitate to stay with Mark at his amazing property in the future."

The kitchen seemed sparse but we were only staying 1 night so it wasn't an issue but could be for a long stay. The host was great with communication and very nice. Friendly neighbors too.
