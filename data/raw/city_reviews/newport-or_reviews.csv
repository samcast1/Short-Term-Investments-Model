Stayed one night","We loved our stay at this beach cottage. It was perfect for our family of 4, including 2 older teenagers. The view is amazing and we loved sitting on the bench in front of the cabin to gaze at the beach and ocean. The location was great. An easy walk to shops, restaurants, and beach access. The neighborhood is so close to everything in Newport but quiet. The cottage had everything we needed and was very clean. We made a simple meal while we were there and had everything we needed. Gina was very responsive and worked with us to make check-in and check-out easy. We will be back again!"

Stayed one night","We had a great stay: short but very satisfying! Everything was top notch. Beach has to be accessed by leaving the property and going 100 yards or so to get to stairs! It's physically taxing so be prepared!
EVERYTHING was very convenient! The amenities are well thought out: the various chargers, folding chairs, a frisbee and the supplies of basics, bathroom was immaculate!
Highest marks! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","The view the view the view!!!! Gina’s place was very clean , had all the amenities you could need, very cozy with nice touches, but the view was the star. I don’t think we ever closed the curtains. From sitting at the window staring out to sitting on the bench outside watching the sunset the view was so spectacular. Area was super walkable with tons of shops, restaurants, and cafes. Will definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Beach Bum Bungalow #7 was very clean and matched the description/pictures perfectly. The view was outstanding and the area was great for walking around town. Gina was extremely fast with responding to questions, which was very appreciated. The only negative is that the shower is small and tight for those that are tall or larger built. My teen son is 6'1"" and had to shower on his knees to fit under the showerhead. While it made us chuckle, it may not be that easy for others to handle. Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay! Thank you for such a lovely place."

Stayed a few nights",we booked this place for my dad and younger son. This was my dad's first trip since my mom died two years ago. The Oregon Coastbis full of memories for him so we did not know if even his adult grandsons could lure him out here (we live here). This bungalow was the icing on the cake. A beautiful peaceful place he had never stayed where he could build new memories. The quiet calm location so close to amazing restaraunts and the beach is absolutely perfect. The cozy homelike atmosphere in this historic cottage with indescribably stunning views and a kind thoughtful host makes this a place our family will book again and again.

Stayed a few nights","This is our second visit to the Beach Bum Cottages. The view from the living room window is AMAZING...so even if it's raining and windy, you can sit inside and watch and listen to the waves. If it's dry, there's a little bench outside that keeps you warm in the radiant sunshine.
It's super cozy and cute.
The beds are comfortable. We were there for almost a week and our back didn't hurt. (YAY!)
The kitchen is small but very functional and well stocked. We cooked several meals and ate looking at the ocean.
It's a short walk to a paved trail down to the sand. You can walk all the to the Agate Beach area or you can walk to the Harbor.
The Nye Beach area is quaint and not as commercial as the rest of Newport.
THANK YOU for a great stay! I am confident we will be back."

Main bed was not able to be walked around both sides so it can be awkward to climb over your partner. It is a small house/cabin; if you are a larger person you may be claustrophobic in the bathroom."

Stayed a few nights","This cottage was amazing. We loved the vintage feel of the space, the incredible picture window with a view of the Pacific Ocean that will never disappoint. The owner takes great pride in her home, and it shows. If you want to visit Newport, historic Nye Beach is the place to be located. You will be able to easily and quickly walk to many wonderful restaurants, shops and the beach is just steps away. Off street parking was great, and the area felt very safe and secure.
We stayed 3 nights and was honestly sad to leave. The space is perfect for two, but it could also easily accommodate a third traveler (just note as another reviewer indicated there are no doors on the bedrooms - which was not a problem for us!) If we were to return to the area, we would love to book this cottage again - for us it was perfect and exactly as advertised."

Stayed a few nights","All the expectations were met from the minute we arrived! Convenient private parking, easy access, very neat and clean, and we were absolutely blown away by the view in #7! What a beautiful place to stay on our mini vacation! There were so many things to see just by walking a short distance in and around Nye Beach... but we spent most of our days taking long walks up and down the beach, and then returning to our cozy retreat in the evening, playing guitar, reading books and enjoying delectable meals from our local finds in Nye Beach. We also took a short drive to Yaquina Head Lighthouse, then down to visit shops-n-sea lions down on the bay front, stopped for some fish-n-chips, and had to sample some decadent chocolate from the confectionery. As we began our drive home, we felt refreshed and ready for the coming week, fondly reminiscing, and thinking about when we will make our next visit!"

The whole place has a nautical theme with some pirate touches that the kids loved. The house is small and close to original from 1910 but that was part of the charm. It worked great for our family of 4. The town was fun to explore and the beach is beautiful. You feel like you have your own private beach house overlooking the bluff. We would certainly stay here again. Thank you Gina for the great experience."

We walked multiple times daily to the beach, plunged into the refreshingly crisp ocean, buried our bodies in the softest sands, listened to the roar of the ocean every night, and drank coffees and took in the tides from the tranquil serene seats right on the bluff overlooking the ocean. It was a homerun in everyway."

Stayed one night","We loved our one night stay. The place had everything we needed, was super clean, cozy, and had a beautiful view. The place worked well for 4 of us with one sleeping on the fold out. We parked and walked to restaurants for dinner and breakfast.
A couple of things to know that we didn't realize before staying there...there are no doors on the bedrooms, there are curtains across the doorways. You get to the beach by walking a block or two from the house and then heading down. Athough it looks like you can get there by walking out the behind the house, it's a high cliff."

Stayed a few nights","Gina is a wonderful host. the views are awesome. But as me and my mom are around 5 foot tall we had a hard time reaching the pull string for most of the lights. Also the fire extinguishers are about 3 years out of date, they need to be taken in. The fire detector in the living room kept going off in the night saying it needs a new battery. the tv has lots of options,but we couldn't get SlingTv or local channels or Netflix to work; so no tv for the duration of our trip. My mom thought the beach was walk-able right out the door,but you have to walk around the corner to get beach access, not far, but not right out the door. The location is good, walking distance to shopping and food. We did enjoy our trip overall."

We had anything we could need for our cooking and kitchen needs, the linens and towels were sparkling clean, and it was just a comfortable place!

Comfortable and equipped with everything you might need.

Stayed a few nights","I had the best vacation of my life. The bungalow was everything I could have asked for. AND THE VIEW from the bungalow was to die for. They thought of every detail possible. From a stocked kitchen utensils, to amazing bedding (so important after a long day of exploring), there is nothing that they have not thought of. The cabin was so clean and comfortable. We relaxed our first night and ordered Abbeys Legendary Pizza. OMGOSH.
Sitting in that dining room window, drinking some wine, and eating that phenomenal pizza, with the view will make your stay worth while.
I am from Nebraska, this vacation made my entire life. I’ve only dreamed of a vacation like this. I couldn’t be more life fulfilled after staying at their bungalow. The town is great, the food was PHENOMENAL, and the attractions are everywhere! We even saw whales (from the bungalow and at Depoe Bay)!
I promise you that you won’t have any qualms after staying here! There’s nothing that will compare. It was amazing. And I even cried a little when I had to leave.
Total 5 stars. I’d leave a 5 star every day of the stay if I could.
I will be back next summer for sure."

There's a grocery store right up the street and it's super close to a bunch of adorable shops, great restaurants, and getting down to the beach. Highly recommend going to check out the Yaquina Lighthouse, which you can see from the Cabin. It's about a 5 minute drive and costs $7 to see the whole area, which includes gorgeous tidal pools. P.S. If you have a National Parks pass, the Lighthouse is free!"

Minutes walk to the Performing Arts Center, the Visual Arts Center, Historic Nye Beach, Galleries, kitschy beach shops, and at least a dozen phenomenal restaurants. Plus it's well above the Tsunami Inundation Zone (You know...just in case)."

Not only are the cottages within walking distance of the beach and shops and restaurants, but Nye Beach is centrally located on the coast. You're within reasonable driving distance of many of the coast's attractions. We'll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Nice, clean cottage in a great location. I've stayed in other cottages in this complex before and enjoy the location and the dog-friendliness. This cottage was very dark - there are no lights in the main living/dining area - only over the kitchen counters along the back wall. There's a nice ceiling fan over the couch but it's not a model that has a light included. My daughter was excited to see the jigsaw puzzles in the cottage but with no light at all in in the dining nook it was too dark in the evenings to do anything at the table or even at the coffee table in the living room.
Kitchen was clean and nice size. It's a little more bare-bones than other airbnb's I've stayed at. We couldn't find a baking sheet and only a small pot for cooking pasta. Bed was comfy and we enjoyed the little deck with chairs off the bedroom. There's even a little peek-a-boo view of the ocean if you look closely. Wish the checkout time were a little later. 10am is earlier than many other places"

Mattress or mattress pad smelled very bad of body odor, through the clean sheets. Both my sensitive-nosed partner & unbothered me noticed immediately upon getting into bed. We slept with our feet to the headboard and an extra blanket under us to limit the smell. A frustrating situation- I recommend to the homeowner to replace. Everything else was very clean."

Stayed a few nights","The house is situated close to everything Nye Beach has to offer, within walking distance. We visited for the Newport Marathon, and the Start Line was only a 1.1 mile walk. Plus, it's right on the course through the Nye Beach section, so my wife got to cheer on our entire team, just about 50 steps out the door. The area is close enough to highway 101 for larger stores or other needs, but very quiet when coming back to relax or when sleeping at night. We had a few teammates stop by after the race, and all of them wished they'd found a place like this. Everything in the house worked as expected, and the provided amenities and consumables were more than adequate. We also enjoyed the fact that our unit had a small but cozy and relaxing deck off the bedroom. We'd definitely stay here again for it's proximity to Nye Beach, and it's location just close enough to downtown Newport, but much quieter."

I intend to return and am looking forward to checking out the other units on the property. There are two things I would recommend for Cottage A. Better lighting over the table for card players, and a warning label on the bubble bath. This jetted tub is as deep as I have experienced and I swear I put in a tiny bit of the product supplied by the hosts (all great) and then had to fight the foam when I turned on the jets. It was comical, never overflowed, and no one to take my “like a movie” moment. I would suggest less than half a teaspoon, if you want to enjoy the jets for any length of time, before you have to turn them off. My friend from Bend told me about these units, and she was right. Praise worthy, and affordable. We will be back."

Me and my boyfriend felt at home from the moment we walked in. The very spacious kitchen was great for preparing dinner after a full day of exploring, and the fantastic gas stove in the living room was a definite highlight. Not only did it add a wonderful ambiance to the space, but it warmed up the entire cottage extremely well! We would love to stay at the cottage again on a future trip to Newport!"

The kitchen has everything to cook and serve full meals. The bed was comfortable. The gas fireplace kept us nice and warm. The bathroom was spotless and clean, with a roomy bathtub/shower. Great location! Easy to find, and close to grocery stores, restaurants, the beach and attractions. Leslie was very quick to respond to text messages. We couldn't have been happier with our stay, and can't wait to go back! Thank you Leslie and Anthony!"

There you also find nice touristy stores, restaurants (Nana's Irish Pub and the Tabhouse were great), Cafes ... you name it. I definitely would recomment this place, also for a longer stay.

Super clean and well-stocked with those little extras for cooking in such as spices, cooking oil, foil. Soft, cushy bed and even the person who slept on the fold out said it was quite comfortable. It was cool when we arrived but there was just a bit of heat on and a warm, cozy smell made it so welcoming after driving. Quiet neighborhood with lots of little shops for food, coffee (essential for morning walks on the beach) and dessert! Leslie and Anthony are very responsive hosts. We'll stay here again at the first opportunity!"

A big plus for us was having a washer/dryer since we had been on the road for a while and it was great to leave with clean clothes!

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely a fantastic cottage that is located a quick five minute walk to the beach, downtown Nye beach, and 45 minutes to Lincoln city.
This cabin was dog friendly, they even provided dog bowls for food and water, chair covers in case your pooches jump up on the furniture, and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was well accessorized and a very pretty home with a lot of cute decor. The enclosed gas fireplace in the living room was amazing, and had all the advantages of your own fireplace, minus having to light it, add wood, or worry about smoke— it kept us super warm while it was snowing, and it also made us feel like we were in the mountains sitting next to a warm fireplace.
The cottage also had all of the channels you could need on its Roku TV: Netflix, Amazon prime, Apple TV— plenty to watch and keep us busy when it was snowing outside.
Also, Plenty kitchen Necessities needed to cook your own meals, and very clean. All in all this is one of the best air BNBs I’ve ever stayed in. (This was my second time staying in these cottages, and this one was even better than the first one. We will be back!)"

The location would be absolutely amazing on sunny days. View of the ocean and eagles flying above. Being Oregon, it rained for a good portion of our time. Being Oregonians, we went out and adventured anyway. Just what we needed for our recharge weekend."

Stayed one night","I wish I could give 6 stars! Even 10! Absolutely the best stay I’ve had anywhere ever. This place is beautiful even beyond what the pictures capture. The unit itself was spotlessly clean, smelled great, beautifully furnished, the perfect space for our 3-person party. The site is amazingly private - a quarter-mile trail loop in the back that’s easily walkable but not trampled-through like many public trails can be, and the woods themselves were gorgeous. The location was perfect - right across the road from Moolack beach, which isn’t crowded at all, and under a 10 min drive to downtown Newport. Walter was an amazing host - communicative, accommodating, extremely helpful, friendly and happy to talk, and even cleared out the fire pit and set it up for us to use! We will be coming back many times, and if you’re wondering if this is the spot for you: it is, book it now!"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely vacation property in a beautiful private setting close to the ocean. Walter was very welcoming. The apartment was adorable, comfortable, clean and well stocked. It was the perfect size for two of us to relax upstairs and downstairs, and the location is perfect for exploring from Depoe Bay to Yachats and beyond. Unfortunately, we had two problems during our stay. The heater didn't work and it was cold inside. The power also went out for about 24 hrs. Although there were some delays in communications, we appreciate Walter's efforts to handle these unexpected problems. Next time we would communicate only through the AirBNB app rather than trying to call or text directly. Despite these issues, we had a great time here."

The location is perfect with the beach just a short walk away and it's just a quick drive into Newport. This lovely unit was spotless, had everything we needed as well as very comfortable beds. Walter was a wonderful host, available to answer questions or to make suggestions regarding the area. He even made sure to direct our attention to a tree top where ""George,"" one of the resident bald eagles, sat watching from above. Overall, our stay was truly enjoyable.

The side yard for pets was perfect and the main reason why this listing was chosen, one thing to consider is other peoples dogs we did have someone who would leave their dog on the provided running line for extended hours of the day, as well as move it to their personal porch, this did not cause any issues as there are other places to take your dog potty right by the cottages and there is a large trash can in the parking lot for doggie bags. i would definitely recommend this airbnb to any couples looking for a getaway.
Beds and couches were SUPER comfy, extra towels provided, small kid toy basket/sand castle materials, doggy supplies (poo bags and bowls!)"

Wanting to sleep in a little on vacation, eat breakfast, pack up, morning walk etc. is a lot to squeeze in. I would absolutely stay again and maybe next time see if I could do an extended checkout. No one wants to feel rushed on the beach :) thanks!"

We have stayed at several hotels and Airbnb's over the last 2 years and many have had a terrible mattress making it hard to sleep. Full kitchen was a plus but we would have liked more counter space. The couch was also comfy but I would say that the chairs at the kitchen table were very hard and our guests had to bring a chair over as there were only 3. The bathroom was small but adorable with a great shower. Overall, we would definitely come back again."

Perfect for our dog who can be easily disturbed. Walk to the beach and store and restaurants. Exactly what was needed. Slept pretty great too!!!Thank you!

Stayed with a pet","We booked this place for a weekend getaway with our dogs and it was fine. The location is great and it was easy to find, walkable to the beach, restaurants, etc. it was pretty clean, though I did find a can of chew on the floor. The communication is a little inhospitable, we were told not to even ask for an early check in or late checkout, and warned to keep our dogs on leashes at all times AND that there was a camera, ostensibly to see if we weren’t. Of course we are more than happy to abide by the rules, keep our dogs leashed, etc. but feeling like we are under surveillance isn’t a great welcome. I guess they must have had problems in the past.
It is affordable, quiet, and has everything you need for a short stay."

It's ideal if you're looking for a nice home base to park the car and explore on foot or by bike. For two people and a dog, this was more than enough room. We're really glad we found it and even more glad they didn't have a multi-night stay minimum -- which made it perfect for a quick weekend getaway."

Very cozy with thoughtful touches like dog treats, snacks, waters, plenty of towels and blankets, etc. assigned parking, and designated dog relief areas right outside.

Stayed with a pet","pros: comfortable bed, close to beautiful beach and downtown Nye, all surfaces were clean, plenty of space for 2 people & dog, newer appliances in kitchen.
cons: This unit is less of a ""cabin"" and more of an ""efficiency"". There was a musty smell (mold?) unless we kept windows open (which was not a good option since they open to the parking lot). TBH, the smell bothered me more than my husband, who does not have allergies. This is 1 of 7 units in an area that feels like it should be 1 lot. There is nowhere to sit outside. People parked & walked right in front of the window at all times of day & night. The space does not feel homey/ cozy; it feels like it's run by a company. For a quick visit, I would stay here again if it weren't for the musty smell."

We had everything we needed to support cooking meals in the kitchenette & Gina even leaves out a snack basket and coffee for guests to have. She was extremely responsive and helpful to a few questions I had. The location is awesome- walkable to parks, the beach, shops and restaurants.

I didn’t know about the two units in front with ocean views, otherwise I would have booked one of those, but it’s just a stones throw walk down a funky “beachy” path to the cliff that overlooks the ocean. The carpet in the living room has some really large stains and there is a strong deodorizer smell that was bothersome, otherwise I’d have given it 5 stars.
I used to live in Newport so Nye Beach is close to everything I came to see including great friends. The weather was as always a little of everything and gorgeous. Plenty of hiking, eating and shopping for a great few days away from the office.
If you’re looking for a place to stay that’s more fun than a plain wrap hotel or motel, this is a great place."

Stayed about a week","There is a lot to recommend this sweet little bungalow. It's clean, well stocked & Gina was very responsive. The location is great, easy walking distance to the beach & half a dozen excellent restaurants, bakeries, coffee cafes. Plus, quick vehicle access to the Bay Front, Coast Hi. & everything the coast has to offer.
Two things made our stay less than five stars:
The metal frame of the pullout couch is quite prominent through the thin mattress. It protrudes uncomfortably against backbone and ribs.
The bungalow has a gas fireplace. We didn't need it in summer, but it's probably wonderful in the winter. The prob is, even in the off position it emits heat; the thermostat was set at 55, but registered 75 as the day went on. When we were present in the afternoon/evening we found ourselves leaving the exterior door open to cool the room down.
The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable; great mattress, quality linens, & a bedroom window that opens to the sounds of the waves."

Stayed a few nights","My son and I spend a weekend at Gina's place after his college orientation. Gina's place worked out perfectly for the two of us: I had the master bed, and he had the pull-out couch, which was very comfortable. Gina's cabin had everything necessary for a comfortable stay, and more. We enjoyed the books about the area, the recommendations in the binder, the coffee available in the kitchen and nice soap/shampoo in the bathroom. It was lovely to walk a few block to go pick up breakfast while my son lounged in bed, and to walk to the beach in 3 min. It was fun to see, perched on the bluff, the fires lit up on the beach when dusk fell. We had a great stay and would stay at Gina's cabin again. Thank you!"

Inside our bungalow was everything one can hope for. Windows are all new, tight, easy to open, and spotless. One could not have the blues with the cheerful seaside decor throughout. Gina has gathered darling accessories over the years. We felt so welcomed. And the best part: a truly comfortable bed. Another bonus: our car was safe and just a few steps away!

The couch was actually quite comfortable without being pulled out into a bed. The whole unit was clean and tidy upon arrival.

Shower water pressure and warmth was we're both great. The bed has a nice pillow topper which makes it a medium firmness.
All of this is enough to get a great review but the location is WONDERFUL! Overlooking the beach.....like you walk out of your door and see/hear the ocean. A path down to the beach is about 5 minutes walk away. Just wonderful.

We shared a five course meal after following the smell to Pacific Kitchen and giggled at the corner table until people started to stare… delicious even if we did miss the ribeye. We gazed and talked and connected and breathed life into weary bodies. We ‘met’ Gina and learned of her family’s history. We listened to the waves. We listened to each other. We rolled dice and rolled our eyes and rolled on the floor like best friends wrestling on the ground. We spoke of the future and of the past as though the two were connected by us… We chose love. We chose sleep and laughter and longing. We chose fun and familiarity. And now we choose to do it thousands more times. If you can swing it, stay here with someone you adore. You won’t regret it."

Stayed a few nights","An inviting cottage with a short early morning walk to the best view of the ocean. The cottage is cozy, beautifully decorated and has absolutely anything a guest could want or need to make their stay absolutely perfect. We will recommend this host and the cottage to others, too. So convenient to visit the entire Nye Beach area with its quaint shops and delicious foods.
A real delight!"

The house itself was sweet and homey— very clean and a perfect fit for me and my friends. The two bathrooms are also great!
We loved the back porch and the super comfy couch.
I was traveling for work while I stayed there and it felt like I was right at home.
Also, a HUGE plus is that the kitchen is actually stocked with all the basics, so you don’t have to buy every little thing just to stay somewhere for the weekend.
Loved loved loved!
She even let me check in a few hours early which was really considerate and flexible"

The bed is very comfortable. The windows downstairs and upstairs open to allow the evening light breezes and seaside air inside to refresh and embellish the living spaces. Bath towels are plush and are plentiful. She has even provided additional towels for beach use. And the parking space is directly in front of the rental to allow ease of transferring your belongings into/out of the property--that feature is very convenient."

I found Dana's place about 8 months in advance and she was really responsive to my brief questions. She also sent directions to the space several months in advance. Once we were in the space, she responded to communication within minutes of a message.
The space itself is great with all the amenities promised and more. It was the perfect accommodation for our brief stay. It is only a few blocks from the beach and a downtown area. We spent every morning walking on the beach before the wedding festivities.
Overall, this was a 5 star space that had a great location, price, and amenities included. It was the perfect spot for our brief trip to the Oregon Coast!"

I intended to catch up on some paperwork while secluded in this ""treehouse"" but instead I got out my yoga mat and spent the time there meditating and grounding. Beach is close for surfside walks. Nye beach shops.and cafes are close also. I found Cypress Cottage to be the perfect place to unwwind and regroup. The kitchen is well equipped and the place spotless. Wish I could have spent more time there."

We booked it because the photos looked like a little treehouse in the sky with lots of windows and it seemed aesthetically pleasing - and it was all of those things! This was a very last minute booking as we decided to try to outrun bad weather a day prior to the start of our holiday weekend, and it worked out perfectly. The location was great, easy to get to and very walkable to the ocean, shops and cafes. We weren't there long enough to use many of the amenities, but everything was exactly as pictured."

Dana had non-slip stickers on the stairs that led up to the bedroom, which was a thoughtful touch to the whole place. She has cute signs to show where to park, where to find the closest beach, and what the wifi password was.
It's a sweet little space, but extremely clean, open, and has a lot of windows that bring in beautiful ocean air. I enjoyed staying at Dana's a lot and she was so kind when I accidentally left my water bottle and helped find a way to return it to me after check out ✨️"

Stayed a few nights","A beautiful, light-filled, peaceful, quiet place within comfortable walking distance to the center of Nye Beach— lovely attention to detail; thoughtful, soothing decor; comfortable furniture; kitchenette set-up just right (we missed having a microwave for a late night popcorn craving, but otherwise we had everything we needed); very responsive communication from Dana. The view over rooftops to the ocean was a nice bonus. Only frustration was being outsmarted by the smart tv (Dana did her gracious best to try to help us find a solution. It’s likely the issue was our unfamiliarity with the system).
We had a couple tasty meals in Nye Beach (Cafe Stephanie and Nye Beach Cafe); our very favorite Newport eatery is Local Ocean—amazing food and beautiful view of the bay from the upstairs seating.
Dana has created a really wonderful place for relaxing and enjoying all that Newport has to offer!"

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I enjoyed our stay! We were here for two nights at the tail end of spring break, and it was very peaceful and quiet on this forested street. It was the best of both worlds: we were within walking distance of shops and restaurants as well! Dana also offered great tips for restaurants and was super friendly and communicative.
The place itself was very comfortable and just as described/pictured in the listing. Super cozy and felt like a treehouse in the upstairs bedroom! Lots of thoughtful touches throughout, a nice blue/teal color scheme, and a comfortable bed.
The only thing that might be a dealbreaker for some people is the steepness of the stairs in the unit. That may pose an issue for folks with mobility issues. On the plus side, the stairs had good traction!
We’d be glad to visit again and highly recommend this cozy AirBnB!"

The private beach access was an added luxury. Everything was clean and comfortable. We felt right at home. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a getaway at the beach. Definitely saving this one for future trips!

Stayed with kids","I booked this stay for my daughter and I to spend a day in Newport and for experience of staying on the beach and Richard’s condo did not disappoint. I truly appreciated how the amenities and attention to detail made us feel like it was our home even if it was just for one night.
We were offered an early check in which was awesome! Entering the unit was easy and the first thing that caught our eyes, was the view! We quickly made our way to the beach which was easy. We also enjoyed being able to do dinner and breakfast at the condo as all of the kitchen amenities were available. We loved it so much and hope to visit again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","This is my favorite place to stay while visiting Newport, I give it 5 stars all around! Samantha is so accommodating with great communications from check-in to check out and anything in between that you might need. Super clean and nicely updated with everything you could possible want for your stay. I Especially loved cooking in the kitchen as it was well equipped for any meal. The bed was comfortable and linens were extra nice. Having Netflix and Amazon services on the TV made my stay even better for my evening entertainment. I loved dinners on the balcony as I watched the sun go down and waking up to the sound of the ocean was so amazing!
I hope to revisit again soon."

The windows and balcony of the place had a picture perfect view, my partner and I spent plenty of time out there. We were able to see a beautiful sunset, stars at night, and even the occasional paraglider flying by. We would definitely stay again."

The espresso maker!!!!! Moving into the main area you see an incredible view of the ocean and when stepping out on the porch the crash of the waves send you into bliss. The bed was soft and the pillows were newer and still soft. We spent both evenings enjoying a movie on their smart tv. I would recommend this place for sure. The area was also great for some light shopping and also sported a few places to eat within walking distance. Wow!

We had a concern when we got there and Samantha was very quick to respond and resolve everything. The condo was well stocked for cooking and even some fun things you wouldn’t think about like binoculars, usb chargers and other home type needs. The bed, arguably the most important part of staying away from home, was firm enough to be supportive and soft enough it didn’t cause hip and shoulder pain, perfect mid range. The view was absolutely phenomenal and falling asleep to the sound of the waves was just beyond compare. The pool and hot tub were on the smaller side but clean and fun to use. Overall, we definitely recommend."

Took a walk down by the beach as soon as we woke up, can’t think of a better way to start off the AM.
Samantha was awesome and very responsive!
Just a short drive away you have Thor’s Well, Devil’s Churn, Cape Cove Beach & Yaquina Lighthouse- all amazing stops.

Stayed one night","This studio condo has it’s own vibrant soul and was perfect for my wife’s birthday weekend getaway. The location is exceptional; it’s within walking distance to a bunch of amazing shops, restaurants, and markets. The guest book has character—reading through some of the experiences others had can give people new to the area ideas. Although the host does a great job at communicating favorite places nearby in the welcome booklet inside the condo. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you’d need if you were planning on cooking during your stay. The shower was refreshing and had good water pressure, the bed was comfortable, and the view was amazing. Sleeping to the sound of the waves was darn near therapeutic. I would highly recommend this studio condo, and if it’s available next time we visit Newport, we’ll be staying here again. The hosts were great and communicated very well with nearly instant response time. If I could rate the place higher I would. We loved our stay!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Some people may think this unit is a bit on the small side, but my partner and I felt it was the perfect. Of course we both spend a lot of time in New York City in tiny accommodations, so that may expose our bias.
We loved everything about this unit - beachfront location, clean, well-appointed, super-comfy bed, easy check-in, great balcony views, fairly quiet (except for a number of dog-barking episodes in a nearby unit, which made us wonder why it didn't drive the dog's owner nuts too).
What we really appreciated most was the size and layout. Perfect for two, HUGE kitchen, but the bed is the unit's central feature, great for enjoying the ocean views/sounds and watching TV.
Would stay here again. Highly recommended."

Our stay was very comfortable and the communication with the co-host was very timely and prompt. For people who are worried about beach access, you don't need to use the steep stairs, you can walk two blocks and get to the beach without any steps. Pool nor Spa was closed but we weren't interested in anyway. We'll definitely go back."

Stayed a few nights","We just returned from 3 nights at Sea Grass Studio and it was the perfect birthday celebration getaway weekend! The location is great - within a few blocks of the cafes, restaurants, and shops in Nye Beach. The views from the condo are fantastic! We slept with the windows open and listened to the waves crashing all night - just lovely! A short walk down the stairs and you are on on the beach and can walk for miles in either direction....perfect for running too! The condo had a fully stocked kitchen with everything you need. Bathroom was nice (great shower!), king bed was comfortable, and they provided throw blankets for curling up on the balcony on cool days (it is the Oregon coast after all!), beach towels, beach chairs...everything you need! We would stay there again in a heartbeat!"

Nice bed and bedding, excellent lighting throughout, well stocked kitchen, and a roomy shower with great water pressure. Best of all the Wi-Fi was amazing which was such a relief after being at a resort they had awful Wi-Fi. The balcony was very nice and looks Right out to the ocean which unfortunately super foggy when we stayed. If there was any downside, I would say the pool and spa area which looked a bit sketchy and were closed. Very enjoyable stay."

The beach access was great but this old babe had to go down 144 steps to enjoy the sunset magic.... and then walk up the steps afterward! It's never clear with some rentals if you are on the beach or above the beach. We were also walking distance to a variety of delightful restaurants. It was a very quiet, safe and tranquil stay."

The shower and the water pressure is wonderful:) Location-wise is only two minutes to Nye Beach cafes and restaurants and only few minutes drive to the bay front.

The studio was very clean and we loved how it was fully stocked (pots, pans, dishes, silverware, plenty of towels, detergent, even down to flashlights.) It seemed like they thought of every detail to make a great stay. only recommendations we have are maybe a fan available or an updated AC unit as we had issues adjusting it. it was set on 50 (lowest) but very hot like the heater was on and we couldn't figure out how to adjust it. We also couldn't sign the guest book because we didn't have any pens or pencils to write with and we couldn't find any either! so sad we missed out on that. But overall we had such a great time and I would definitely return and recommend to my friends and family!"
