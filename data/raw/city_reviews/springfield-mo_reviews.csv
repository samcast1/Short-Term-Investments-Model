Stayed with a pet","This was our second stay. The house is exactly as pictured/described. It is perfect for us as an overnight with 2 dogs during travel, but would be equally good for someone staying longer in Springfield. Thank you Libby for making the house so welcoming after a long day in the car."

Stayed one night","Libby's place was just as beautiful as the photos! Our group was only in Springfield for one night, however, I wish we had more time there specifically to enjoy the great backyard space. Beautifully lit with string lights, plenty of seating, and a fireplace. Would definitely recommend this place for your stay in Springfield!"

Stayed one night",One of the best places we have stayed! Peaceful and very modern and many thoughtful updates. Our family of four was able to visit on quaint front porch and beautiful backyard and loved the interior too. We didn’t bring our dogs this visit but would be perfect place for them to enjoy on our next visit. Thanks Libby!

Stayed one night",Libby’s place is one of our new favorites. It’s a delightful and cozy retreat in a walkable and beautiful neighborhood. It’s spotlessly clean and supplied with everything you could possibly need for a comfortable and memorable stay. 5 stars seems somehow inadequate. We’ll for sure be back.

Stayed with a pet",Libby is an exceptional host. Her place was immaculate and felt so welcoming with lights on and fire going when we arrived after dark. She had even left out treats and a cat toy and basket for our traveling companion! The place was spotless and so well-equipped with additional amenities too. Our daughter was particularly excited to learn that there was a unicorn chair in the closet just for her. Libby was accommodating with our check out time and communicated well prior to and during our stay. It was nice to sit out in the sunny garden on departure morning. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend and wished we could have stayed an extra night - it was the most comfortable bed on our week long road trip relocating across the country!

Fully stocked kitchen. Coffee on hand so it’s there the first morning g while you figure out groceries you might need. ☺️Bedrooms comfortable. The couch great for TV watching.

Stayed with a pet","Such a cozy and homey place! My husband and I stayed during the coldest weekend and it was so nice having the electric fireplace in the living room and a good heating system in the house. It stayed toasty warm inside and there were plenty of blankets - we felt right at home.
The location is great! We were never more than 15 minutes from all the restaurants and shops we wanted to go to. Loved that downtown and C Street were 5 minutes away.
Libby is an excellent hostess with attention to detail and lovely decor/style throughout the home. We had everything we needed for our weekend getaway. A few spots were a little dusty (under bed & coffee maker) and could use a wipe down, but overall the home was clean.
Loved the thoughtful touches for our dog! She loved the pet bed and toys. She also loved the big fenced in backyard.
We enjoyed our stay and would absolutely book again!"

It's like if your best friend (who's a fabulous decorator) said you could use their home. There were so many details - from many appliances, coffees, snacks, candies, adorable little emery boards to just name a few - that made it so special.
And it was so comfortable, easy to use, and livable, Libby's home makes you want to stay longer.
Thanks! it was delightful!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at SO many Airbnb’s Libby’s by far is the nicest!! Clean, cozy and SO comfortable. It is like a paradise! We preferred to stay in more than going out because it was like a vacation home. She had anything and everything you can think of for the house! The cherry on top is it is very dog friendly which is so hard to find! Libby also had great recommendations on places to eat loved the extra touches of gifts for the pups and welcoming music when we walked in along with making sure the lights were on for us. It is truly nicest gestures! Libby also had snacks and tons of coffee/tea options. This is 100% worth the stay and we plan to stay every year we can!! Thanks Libby for sharing your little slice of paradise with us and the pups!"

Beautifully done with plenty of comfortable seating. The flowers everywhere were just gorgeous and made it feel so homey. Libby went above and beyond making our fur babies feel at home. I have stayed at lots of AirBnBs and this one definitely makes the top 5!
Libby was extremely responsive and was flexible with our check-in time which we soooo appreciated since we needed to get our dogs situated before we had to attend a wedding.
Great location, near plenty of restaurants. I would definitely recommend and I am saving the listing to my favorites in case we’re back in the area."

Libby is next door readily available to answer questions and make recommendations but never intrusive. All the above made our 7-day stay at the Dryer House the best Airbnb experiment my husband and I have ever had. Libby even had the kiddie pool in the backyard filled with cool water for our poodles on arrival!"

Stayed with a pet","I cannot say enough about this beautiful location.
You are greeted by a stunning porch with beautiful ferns and sitting spots where design and comfort come together spectacularly. It feels as though the house is giving a hug as you walk in the front door. Every single detail was well thought out and considered.
The beds are amazing! The bathrooms gorgeous. The photos really don’t do it justice. The location is perfect in a neighborhood of old houses and front porches. Tons to do right near by and easy off the highway. The owner is delightful and so accommodating. It is what Airbnb was intended to be. We added an unexpected extra night when our plans changed last minute and it was so easy. If you are in the area do yourself a favor and book at least two nights here because when you wake up from the first night you won’t want to leave!"

My dogs felt right at home with the dog bed and toys for them to play with. They also loved running around the stunning backyard. I couldn’t get enough of the the backyard and how cozy it was. We asked for recommendations on dinner and Libby was friendly enough to assist. She also had some magazines on the table with local dining and activity options. If we find ourselves back in the area again we’ll definitely be looking up this place! Thanks for giving us a lovely little getaway."

An overflowing basket of human treats on the counter and relaxing music playing on the speaker all created such a nice first impression.

The transformation is quite impressive! I love that she has before pictures displayed so you can see the detail that went into this remodel! From the driveway to the back yard, you will find that this home is tastefully designed with YOU in mind! This gem is not only an exquisite find, but clean, furnished and staged unlike any other Airbnb that I have found in my stays! The guest basket and banana bread were over the top and very inviting!

They let us know several hours early that the house Was ready, and very accommodating to us And our requests. The house is truly a three bedroom two full bath, a fenced in backyard, nice grill on the patio. This is in a family residential neighborhood and was quiet. We took a walk around on all the many sidewalks after our long drive and felt safe. The house was fully stocked and beautifully decorated. There was a closet full of toys for children. A baby bed. Really they thought of everything. The location was nice and easy to get to most everything in Springfield. We took the kids to Rutledge Farm,(literally right around the corner from the house) which is run by the public park system. Amazing what Missouri does for its citizens. The park was over the top. I recommend going to casey’s convenience store down the street for breakfast pizza. Yum Great place!"

Stayed with kids",We had a wonderful girls' trip here and enjoyed every minute! Great location. The extra mattresses available that are mentioned in the listing are not air mattresses they are the real deal and kept for use in the master closet. Michael and Lu even told us we were welcome to park inside the garage which was amazing due to the bad weather one night. You can tell they have really taken care of their home. We will definitely look them up again on our next visit to Springfield!

It’s close to the Rutledge-Wilson Farm Park which the kids loved. It’s a short drive to restaurants and the Bass Pro Shops. The house was very clean and in great condition.

Place was clean and we enjoyed our stay. Back road was was a bit busy behind house and at times seemed a bit noisy and you can hear plans taking off from nearby airport, but most noise was early morning or later, so did not disrupt sleep times. Only thing I would ask more for is a bit more cooking utensils. But would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This house is spotless! Check in with keyless entry was a breeze. It was a bonus to be able to park in the garage. House was filled with details, like a Keurig and cups, plenty of dinnerware and silverware, and extra linens. This was a multi-generation girls trip and we had plenty of room with my mom, sister, niece, and me.
The house is located in a neighborhood with a feeling of being rural, yet having access to stores and restaurants within 5 minutes.
Noise level at night inside the house was low. The house backs up to a main road and is at the entrance of the subdivision. We could hear a train horn in the distance throughout the evening, and some airplanes overhead, with the airport about 10 miles away. We did not sit outside or use the yard.
The master bedroom was extremely bright early in the morning. There are blinds, but not curtains. If you like to sleep in past daybreak, you will need a sleep mask.
Communication with the hosts was very prompt and courteous. I would recommend this place!"

Michael even provided a bedroom alarm clock before we arrived when I asked if there was one in the house. This home was immaculately clean, well-stocked, in a safe quiet neighborhood, and at a very reasonable cost. They provided eggs, bottled water, coffee, and snacks. The home is very “kid-friendly” as so many items were available for small children. We felt as if the owners lived there and just left for the week and let us stay. It was a perfect location for our trips between Bolivar and Branson. Next time we visit Springfield – this will definitely be our “go-to” place. Thanks so much to Michael and Lu!!"

They also responded very quickly to us when we had to ask about something while there. In addition, the bed was very comfortable, which makes a huge difference to us! We would definitely look to stay there again on future trips. Highly recommend this place."

The owners provide lots of special touches. There was coffee, milk, juice, some frozen treats and food, some candy and snack items... Also extra items, that could get forgotten... like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and soaps, even q-tips, plenty of toilet paper, laundry supplies, etc. We could have been comfortable to stay much longer than the one night we were there. The hosts were also great to respond right away, and communicate very well. I felt they were extremely hospitable, and easy to work with. They were even able to offer an early check-in for us. We have no complaints at all - and loved our stay in this home!💯"

Stayed with kids","Wonderful place that's better than the photos!
The main common area was the big draw for us and it was wonderful. We visited family, had 4 generations from 96 yo to 18 months and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
With the fireplace in the center of the common area, you have a large open space but just enough of a divider that activities can be in the kitchen and living room areas. It's spacious, well-stocked and the fireplace isn't just for looks - it really heated the place! And it like the rest of Anastasiya's home, it's beautiful.
Wish we'd had more time, we could have had a movie night or even two... esp w massively large TV in main bedroom! Everyone loved the ""Best Seat in the House"" and the ample closet space was a plus. We were in love w the screened-in porch even though it was a bit cool to be out there.
It's a comfortable, beautiful, spacious home. If you want to have time together, this is the place!
Host Anastasiya was helpful and proactive - Thank you!"

The host was very responsive and proactive about all information. The microwave was broken so we couldn’t reheat any of our food. That really sucked. The home was extremely clean. Lots of towels were provided. There’s a HEATED toilet seat! The kitchen was stocked with great supplies. There’s no blinds in the home at all. That was the only thing that I disliked.

Don't be startled by the automatic-cleaning toilet in the master bathroom. It will automatically raise the lid when you get near, and runs a cleaning cycle in the middle of the night.
The windows are huge and amazing, making for a light and bright home during the day. But know that there are no window coverings so people can see in at night. Just something to be aware of. :)"

The pictures don’t do this home justice it is truly amazing in person. We loved the option of being able to use the kitchen and laundry room, it was especially helpful with all the kids clothing we had to clean. A beautiful and very thought out floor plan with many items at your disposal. We loved the shampoo, condition, and body soap in the restrooms. One of the best seats in the house was the master bathroom toilet. I definitely want to purchase one of those for our home. The heated seats were magnificent! The best amenity in the home was hands down the espresso machine. I have a similar model at home so I was able to use it with no problem at all. We enjoyed all the extras to make our fancy coffee drinks as well. The caramel drizzle was fantastic! The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. Overall, the stay was nothing short of fantastic. We appreciate greatly the last minute reservation and the clear communication throughout the whole process. We will gladly be returning if we ever come back to Springfield. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone! 10/10 stars 🌟"

It’s in a very safe and quiet neighborhood but it’s close to everything. Also, check in is at 3pm, earlier than most airbnbs, and the check out was at 3pm, way later than any Airbnb I’ve ever seen!! The hosts obviously thought everything through very well to make it as accommodating and comfortable as possible! My fav Airbnb so far!! Can’t recommend it enough!!"

Stayed one night","Kathleen was an absolutely lovely host! Staying with her was like dropping by an Aunt's house for the weekend whilst in town for other things. She made me feel so welcome, and she was readily available for any conversation or questions. But she also made me feel very free to come and go as needed, at any hour of the day, with no need to ""check-in"" or let them know my schedule throughout the day. I had my own code for the front door which worked perfectly, my own bathroom to use, and the bedroom/bathroom were at the front of the house so I didn't need to worry about walking through the rest of the property and disturbing anyone (nor did anyone disturb the area where I was staying.)
Our son just finished his Freshman year at Missouri State in Springfield, and we'll be making a lot of visits to the city. I hope that we will be able to stay with Kathleen and Bob for many of those visits to come!"

Stayed a few nights",Kathleen and Bob were wonderful hosts! They made me feel welcome and cared for. They touched my heart and were more than just hosts. They made me feel like family I came to visit. It was an unforgettable experience and meant more to me than I could ever express. I appreciate the comfort and love I felt meeting them and being able to spend time with them.

Stayed a few nights","My sig other and I were in town for 2 nights for business. Typically we stay at hotels and this was our first time ever at a shared space. The room was perfectly comfortable, equipped with all we needed and easy to access as was the private bathroom. We didn’t even see our hosts the first day though they were quick to respond once notified we had arrived. I met them in person the next afternoon and they gave me a quick tour of the other space on the property, which was detached and larger. I got to hear and share stories with them and hearing about their travels and why they did it said so much about who they are and makes me want to help support them any way possible! They are so kind and giving! They had towels set out, toiletries, very clean accommodations and I cannot wait until our next visit. Above and beyond gracious hosts!"

As for the space, the home is mitiscually maintained. The bed is super comfy and I had one of the best, nights of sleep.
The dog, which is named happy in Vietnamese, is also joy and so sweet. I was able to play fetch and unwind from the road. It was one the best host experiences I have had in a long time.
As long as you follow the hosts, simple rules, you will have the best time like I did. I will definitely be back ,when I am in the area."

While I appreciate the last minute availability, I was disappointed the whirl pool tub didn’t work given the $115 cleaning fee.
All and all, it was a nice stay. Much more quiet than I expected."

In a nice downtown area with great food. Only caution is the lack of privacy between the bedrooms as the ceiling is open so you can hear everything between the downstairs bedrooms. Plenty of parking behind the loft. We had a truck and trailer and fit just fine. Melinda was responsive and helpful.

Street parking was a bit of a challenge arriving at midday on Saturday - we had to park a block away, but were able to move our cars closer later in the day when shops had closed and things were less busy. The place is super cute, but the wood floors are old and very creaky! We all heard each other getting up to go to the bathroom throughout the night. Also train track right behind the building - I like some white noise so it didn’t bother me much but between that and creaky floors, light sleepers might want to bring ear plugs !"

This is right next to the railroad so the cars sometimes sound like thunder but it's less noticeable in the Queen bunk area off the kitchen or the smaller bedroom on the main floor. We also had my Grandparents with us and while there were many stairs (24 stairs to reach the floor of the entrance that leads to the guest & master bedrooms plus another 10, a landing and then 12 to reach the queen bunks, kitchen & living room) it was manageable for them with the sturdy rails! It's a great location and I think your family will love it too!!"

I got married across the street, so it was a perfect place for my bridesmaids and I to hang out and get ready. My now-husband and I spent our wedding night here as well and wished we could have stayed longer. As an interior designer myself, the boho and eclectic vibes completely matched my own tastes.
Highly recommend, 10/10."

We love the little shops all around, having a warm drink and breakfast down the stairs at Big Momma’s and the best pizza at Pizza House! I’ve used it to be close by my daughter’s place at MSU and for family gatherings during holiday and graduation. Plenty of space having living area both downstairs and upstairs. Cute decor with counter swings and a wonderful kitchen area to dine in. I sleep with noise canceling ear pods so I don’t hear the train at night, but both husband and son-in-law comment on train for sleep so maybe pack earplugs. I love it though!!! Melinda is an amazing host with prompt wonderful communication you can count on at any time! You’ll not be disappointed!"

My husband and I, our son, our daughter and her husband stayed here over Christmas week. I was concerned about the proximity to the railroad tracks as I can be a bit sensitive to sound at night, but surprisingly the walls and windows blocked out the sound very well. This place was great for our family. It would also be great for a girls or guys trip. Not sure how well it would be with small kiddos, but I know I would have been able to make it work. I hope we get the opportunity to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Fun place to stay in a historic building. Everything has been redone and is one of the most unique place I've stayed in an Airbnb. Was not an issue for me but the master is quite bright in the morning but luckily the couple in there always bring eye masks when traveling so it wasn't a big deal - plus the room is lovely. We were a bit worried because the train track was so close but this wasn't an issue at all. Rooms are a bit lacking in privacy, but again it's an older building so that's part of its uniqueness. Fun bars within walking distance and we had a late breakfast and coffee at Big Momma's next door a couple of times - really good and fantastic service. Other restaurants are down the street but we didn't have time to try them out. If you enjoy eclectic places then you need to stay here when visiting Springfield."

This loft is the perfect place to host groups! Its very spacious, very comfortable, appointed nicely and also allows some private spaces within it. Not to mention the beds and pillows are really really comfy! Great place to have friends and family congregate. You and your family will enjoy the swings as much as we did! The location can't be beat. C street is the happening place to be in Springfield as there are wonderful restaurants and fun shops right out the front door! It is a short drive to a multitude of things to do, as well as a quick drive from the Airport. Another unexpected bonus, the trains directly out back. Very interesting to watch this activity as well and they also lulled us to sleep every night. We will stay here again!"

The house has real character.
It is small but as advertised but for one night and for a driving Pit Stop it was perfect.
The bed was comfy and sheets and towels soft, although we only had one set of towels.
Plenty of coffee, creamer etc as well as bathroom products.
Parking was directly outside the house and very safe.
The Neighbourhood was very quiet and we slept well.
its about a 10-15 mins to some great restaurants and bars.
We ate in Black Sheep and was fabulous if you like burgers and shakes!
(Hands down best I've ever had)
While it's unlikely we'll return as were from England and this road trip is a one off, if I was in the area I'd stay here again and recommend staying here also."

Upon arriving, super flexible check-in and allowed me privacy. The place was tiny, creatively decorated and still held some historical architecture on the inside. I loved the place and found it to be very cozy. I had my dog with me and the yard was tiny so it would be a little more crowded with a big puppy. I would still recommend for anyone visiting as a couple or just 2 occupants, any more would be very crowded. Great access to other areas of Springfield and worth the money I spent."

I've paid much more for a hotel overnight in Springfield that gave me much less. This was private, easy load and unload, plenty of space, proper accommodations and all for less than a cheap hotel. Wonderful neighborhood and felt safe and comfortable. there was even a picnic area and relaxing space, both in the shade and in the Sun. Great place and I highly recommend it.
I'll definitely be back on my many trips to see grandkids and family and friends."

He was always quick to respond and he was also very interesting and a talented guy… it was an added perk to meet him! Great place for an overnight with your furry friend at a reasonable price!

Can’t do too much better than a 1920s gas station. The decorations were an added plus. It was a great location, especially if you want to be close to downtown and restaurants. If you are a light sleeper may not be best for you as the traffic is a bit loud BUT it’s a 1920s gas station within walking distance of downtown so for us worth the extra noise. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed our stay."

Stayed one night","Kelley’s Place has a lot going for it. First of all, the neighborhood is just beautiful. I took a long walk down two of the country roads and you wouldn’t think you’re near a city. This home and the other homes in the area are unique, upscale and located on lovely lots. Neighborhood is peaceful and very quiet. I didn’t use the deck but it would be a nice place to sit and read a book or enjoy a cup of coffee.
The private entry/access was nice, the bed was comfy and the shower was great with plenty of hot water. The wall-mounted HVAC unit was ultra quiet (silent really) and provided a nice, even heat. It’s really a perfect apartment for one or two people.
This is a pet friendly unit and I should have paid more attention to that when I booked. As such, I noticed a mild, doggie aroma as well as dog hairs on my socks when I walked around without shoes."

Away from crowded city area of Springfield, but easy access to restaurants and shops. Only complaint is that there are two street lights right outside the windows of the cottage which made it too bright at night. Bring a sleep mask if you like it dark at night.

Kelley was awesome, as I rolled in at around 2am, they made sure all the lights were left on inside and out. If you’re looking for a quiet, clean, nice place, that’s close to a lot but is tucked away and peaceful this is it."

I would definitely like to stay here the next time I visit Springfield."

Stayed with a pet","This is a clean and stylish studio in an upscale neighborhood. Kelley's communication was excellent and she allowed us to check in early. My husband and I, along with our little dog, were in town to take our daughter to a college visit. This location is an easy drive to colleges, restaurants, etc. The weather was very windy with some rain and the temperatures ranged from the 30's to the 50's. The only minor negatives we found is there is no dishwasher in this unit, and turning around in the parking area with our big truck was a little tight, but those were not big issues for us. This would be a safe place to stay for a single person traveling alone. It is also suitable for a couple or a someone with a small pet. I highly recommend Kelley's Airbnb."

Nice to have the tile floor so I wasn’t worried about me or my dog tracking anything in onto a carpet in the wet weather. (But especially if you do bring your pup, I suggest bringing a couple towels or something to step onto when you come inside for drying paws/leaving shoes as there are no floor mats at all inside.)
It was extremely cold for my stay, but I’m sure In warmer months the back deck would be a lovely spot to sit out. As it were, it was great to be by the wooded area to take my dog out to stretch etc. Thanks for the lovely place, Kelley!"

Stayed one night",My husband and I stayed to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. We had great communication with our host and the house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood. The room was clean and had a nicely stocked kitchen with the basics. There’s also a grill and a fire pit but we did not use those because it had rained. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay again.

The space was clean and comfortable, Kelley was communicative, and the location was perfect (situated just outside the business district of Springfield). Thanks for having us (furry friend included)!"

Stayed one night","Staying at Kelley’s place was so convenient and comfortable. We stopped here on our road-trip and had to check in late, but it was no problem because of the self check-in process. The place itself was very clean and comfortable. We brought our dog and had no issues, especially with the space in the backyard for him to potty and fetch. Kelley was very quick to answer all my questions and concerns. We would stay here again!"
