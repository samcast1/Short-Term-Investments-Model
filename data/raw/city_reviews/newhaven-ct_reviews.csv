Just a note…would have loved a door between main bedroom and living area (we had our kid with us and could have used a bit more privacy 😉)
But the place was impeccable and clean and we felt sooooooo taken care of. 10/10 would absolutely stay again."

Hosts are extremely responsive and helpful. This is a fabulous place to stay for a few days or a month! Love it!"

Stayed a few nights","Naomi's cottage is simply lovely. Sparkling clean, nicely furnished with a whimsical flair. Too many extra nice touches to list here (thick towels, parking, high quality kitchen appliances, umbrellas, comfortable bed, washer/dryer..I could go on). Anything we might need during our stay was there already. Very convenient to Yale campus (we walked there more than we drove). It is definitely now our favorite place to stay in New Haven! We were so comfortable during our stay. I have only good things to say and overall give it a 5/5 star review!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely LOVED this space and my stay! Beautiful! Peaceful! The space is warm and welcoming and was a lovely spot to call home away from home for a few days…I honestly would move in if I could. Also loved all the technology throughout…and….make toast at some point during your stay! :) Communication with co-host Aljon was a pleasure…he was so kind, understanding and helpful for any questions I had. I also had the pleasure (briefly) of meeting other folks who care for the property too and everyone was phenomenal and kind.
Adored the wonderfully walkable and public transit accessible neighborhood. If you want to be dazzled by flowers and plants, check out the botanical gardens nearby too!"

Stayed about a week","This is the most comfortable room we have stayed in New Haven, fully equipped with not only laundry and cooking, but also fully equipped with everything you need for office.To say the only deficiency, it may be that the small animals behind the house and the quietness caused by the fallen fruit in this season, the sound of the fruit is slightly affected by sleep.Everything else is very satisfactory!Thank you for your help during our stay and look forward to staying again next time."

Aljon provided timely communications with clear instructions. The cottage was clean, organized and impeccably decorated, and had all of the latest technology. Even the toaster had a digital display! There’s an outside patio which we thoroughly enjoyed for meals, coffee and playing board games (which were also included). The hosts had bicycles available for us to use to explore the city.
We highly recommend staying here if ever you’re in New Haven or nearby. We’ll definitely look to stay here on our next New Haven adventure."

Stayed a few nights","This place is one of the best Air bNb places we ever stayed. It was decorated so cute, was clean, and had many special extra touches. There were fresh plants and flowers, a Magnolia cookbook that we made a couple recipes from, a portrait that ended up being the TV, board games, a lovely patio with ceiling fans, canvas grocery bags, umbrellas, and two bicycles. The kitchen was well stocked but also included an instant pot and a high-speed nutibullet blender. The bed was comfortable, and there were lots of throw blankets around. The shower was luxurious along with nice soaps and shampoo. It was conveniently located and easy to find. It was so much better and more comfortable than any hotel. Hosts were responsive. The worst part was we were only there for two nights... I could have stayed all summer. If we come again, this is definitely where we will book to stay again."

Stayed about a week","Sandy was an excellent host. She gave us a wonderful welcome basket. The bathroom was large and was so beautifully decorated it looked like a page from a home decor magazine. The sofa was comfy and we liked the large desk. Internet was good too. She provided a fully stocked kitchen for cooking with a high-quality stove/oven and refrigerator and a freezer with an ice tray. It felt more like home with complete sets of silverware, dinnerware, cookware, glasses, including elegant wine glasses. We loved the nearby water location and easy freeway access.
We didn’t need the loft bedroom for sleeping but it is a good space to escape for reading. The provided board games, cards and books were a thoughtful touch and added to our stay. We used the washer and dryer and appreciated the included detergent."

Stayed a few nights","Sandy and Rob are beautiful humans and wonderful hosts. Their cottage is a perfect blend of comfortability, charm, and coziness. As soon as you step through the door, you get the feeling of being at home. There are 'little touches' everywhere; this speaks to the first-class experience that Sandy and Rob are curating for their guests. Great amenities and the welcome basket was an unexpected nice touch of generosity. The communication during the reservation process was superb and Rob took the time to walk us through the space, making sure that he answered all of our questions.
If you're looking for a place to relax, and enjoy a peaceful stay, this is indubitably a place you should consider booking. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and would also highly recommend checking out Shell & Bone restaurant - incredible food and service."

From the thoughtful welcome basket filled with cookies, flowers and a bottle of wine... to the plush towels and bathrobes, this Airbnb felt more like home than any other we've stayed at.
Our two kids loved sleeping in the loft and running around the backyard or climbing the big tree. We all enjoyed eating dinner outside!
if you stay here you also need to make the 5 minute walk to Shell and Bone restaurant for dinner or brunch! amazing food."

We live locally but needed a quick getaway, both to concentrate on getting some writing done (away from the demands of home), and as a short retreat for us and our preteen kids. Nothing could have been better…. The casita is stylish (reminded me of the Netherlands), peaceful, and extremely cozy. We felt pampered by the gift basket there when we arrived, as well as the hotel-like bathrobes and bathroom. And the beds are amazing. Also, such a cool historic neighborhood, just a block from the marina. Felt like we’d gone to Europe and we were only 10 mins from home!"

Stayed with kids","Our family of 2 adults and 2 rambunctious kids stayed at Sandy's rustic cottage. The cottage is very cozy, airy and styled with vintage finds and contemporary accessories and tech. All of the spaces in the cottage are like new or renovated. The bathroom is spacious and the shower is indulging. We enjoyed cooking in the open, stocked kitchen. There is a beautiful garden outside with birds chirping all day. The beds are comfy: the smaller bed has a firmer mattress, the bigger one is softer. The skylights in the roof fill the rooms with lots of light. Everything was exactly per description and even more charming in person. One note, we did not use the washer and dryer, which were in host's house due to COVID-19 self-isolation precautions.
A marina is a short walk around this area with historic houses. There are many supermarkets and New Haven parks within short drive. We did not check out any restaurants during our stay. Sandy and Rob were very discrete, communicative, and helpful. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Sandy was a great and warm host. The location was close to town but yet situated in a quiet neighborhood. Everything in the cottage was beyond adequate if you like to cook or eat in. Very spacious and tastefully decorated. With a bed room and loft, we had a party of 3 and we were very comfortable there. Sandy also welcomed us with a wonderful snack basket.
We also went for Christmas Eve through Christmas and was just the right place if you just want to get away and have some down time. There are outdoor seatings, great to hang out in. We had our privacy but felt look after by Sandy. We are extremely happy we stayed and to have met Sandy. We also enjoyed New Haven a lot with varieties of local things to do."

Stayed about a week","OK - this is an easy one. Sandy's place is in a gorgeous part of New Haven in historic City Point. Very easy access on and off I-95 but given the historic nature of City Point I didn't hear the freeway. Sandy has missed nothing in raising the bar for an AirBnB stay - the cabin is superbly equipped with all of the latest conveniences. But the ambience is simply stunning - its like living in a mini library with great comfort in the bed rooms and lounge, a great sound system in Amazon's Alexa &internet TV and a 5 star bathroom!
I arrived into this little paradise after a 24 hr flight and to find the amazing Shell & Bones Oyster Bar and Grill only a few hundred metres walk was just perfect. It doesn't get much better. For those of you looking for a run there is quite a nice trail very close to the cabin - if you stick to the path and run to the end of the most eastern wharf you can just make 5 km return if you finish at City Point Kitchen - may as well stay for brunch.
Simply perfect - and I was here for work!"

The apartment is very functional and large enough for a family of 4, the beds are comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need to cook. In addition, everything is very clean, the decoration is perfect and the outdoor courtyard is very good.
Sandy is very nice and responds quickly to the courials.

We were easily able to walk from the cottage to two of the local restaurants down beautifully tree-lined streets, all while smelling the fresh air and listening to the wind off Long Island Sound blow through the trees. If you are looking to dine at any number of the fabulous multi-cultural restaurants in downtown New Haven and near Yale, we found both driving and taking an Uber or Lyft very convenient. There are also a number of markets near Yale to pick up any necessities for the fridge/freezer back at the cottage. Thanks to Sandy, we fell in love with New Haven!"

She couldn't have been a more responsive host, and the amenities from the welcoming basket of wine, cookies, and other treats to the sparkling condition of the house far surpassed our expectations. She and her husband have obviously spent a great deal of effort and care in their design and furnishing of this sweet little casita. We loved the loft area for both sleeping and a play space for our grandson when he visited. The light, live green plants (nothing plastic), comfortable conversation/TV area, and privacy were much appreciated. And we loved exploring the City Point neighborhood. We can't say enough about Sandy's cottage and we look forward to coming back again and again.
Thank you, Sandy!"

This was very much appreciated after a long flight. We were in Connecticut visiting Yale (my daughter was just accepted to Class of 2023-Go Bulldogs!!) and the location of the cottage was perfectly located just a few minute away from campus by car. The cottage is as cute in person as it is in the pictures. Sandy goes above and beyond providing so many extras throughout the cottage. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Connecticut. Thanks Sandy!

Sandy went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and helped with any questions we had. The space was very clean and the complementary snacks and beverages that Sandy provided for us were the icing on the cake—especially the real creamer for coffee, which i ALWAYS forget to grab when on vacay.

One bug-a-boo that I have had with all my Airbnb experiences is that the kitchens had mostly second hand pots, pans, knives, and it would be a stretch to prepare a whole meal. Well, this place has it all and then some. The retro steel sink and cabinets are fantastic as are the professional stove. Every pot imaginable as well as every small utensil that is very useful. I could actually live here. My other bug-a-boo is that all other rentals had knives that were dangerously dull and did not have a sharpener. Well Sandy's is well stocked with sharp knives and good quality as well.
The place is spacious, very tastefully decorated. New bathroom with great hot shower.
And a fire extinguisher! I would highly recommend staying here."

Stayed a few nights","This is a review for the main house rather than cottage as the hosts asked us to stay there during landscaping work.
On the day of arrival we were informed that there was no power in the area due to a storm so had to find an alternative. The hosts did not refund the night that we couldn’t stay, but Airbnb did as a goodwill gesture.
When we arrived we were met by Rob who was trying to resolve an alarm issue in the house due to the power outage - luckily he did so.
In the event we spent 16 hours in the house, but it was very stylish, spacious and comfortable and a shame we couldn’t have been there as long as intended. Everywhere was very clean and the beds were comfortable and bathrooms lovely.
We were able to cook easily as there is a full kitchen and relax with Alexa and Netflix!! The welcome package was also great.
It was especially good for us to be able to leave our rental car in the driveway for 3 days to take a train to New York City and saved us a lot of effort finding secure parking or having to rent two cars.
Highly recommended and wish we could have stayed longer."

Stayed a few nights","This review is for the house instead of the cottage due to some renovations being done to the back patio. Rob and Sandy were thoughtful enough to allow us the use of the larger space in the house so as to avoid some of the noise and clutter in the back yard.
We loved everything about the place, especially all of the stylish furniture and eclectic animal decorations. Rob and Sandy were punctual with all communication over the course of the entire process. Alexa was also very helpful and fun to use while winding down for the evening!
In terms of location, it was very easy to get to downtown New Haven; just a short drive to the lovely Yale campus and surrounding museums. A big thank you to Rob and Sandy for all the extra unexpected amenities and treats! There was so much thought put into welcoming us for our arrival and when we checked out."

It's a great location with a pretty straight shot into the city. Perfect for biking. There is a sketchy neighborhood several blocks away, but that shouldn't be a problem unless you go wandering around at night. We hope to come back!"

They gave us a small tour and told us how to lock up among other things. The house was perfect for us. It came with a comfortable living room and kitchen that was very modern and beautiful. The bed room had a sizable extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was comfortable and had a great shower. The loft room upstairs was a great addition. Sandy's was a 5 minute drive to resturant and supermarkets. We enjoyed our get away and recommend you enjoy yours at sandy and roberts

The casita is well equipped, super clean and tucked away in a secret garden spot. My cousin, sister and I stayed 3 nights and wished we had the time to stay longer. It is located near Yale University, Yale New Haven Hospital, the train station (we were there to attend a concert at Carnegie Hall in NYC) the famous Frank Pepe's Pizza, Little Italy, the Connecticut Shore. The perfect place for a lovely, relaxing get-a-way. Highly recommended. We will returning!!"

Sandy kindly had set up for coffee, fresh fruit, and wine and water for us. The bed was very comfortable, the bath was clean with a great shower and bath linens. We had come for a weekend event for kids at Yale and I foolishly left our registration at home--Sandy was super generous in helping us get these forms printed.

I can tell they put a lot of effort in making this cottage nice and I must say out of all the places I have been to, this cottage has a perfect balance and is within a short 5 min drive to anything you need in New Haven. The biggest surprise to my girlfriend and I was the bath robes they provided. I have never seen that before and being able to sit comfortably in our robes drinking tea as the sun shined through the sky lighting was an experience I have never experienced until now. I would most definitely try and stay here again if I could."

The apartment was comfortable and had everything we needed (and more) for a weekend away, and the location couldn't be beat. It was so great to not need to rent a car for the weekend, and we set about exploring the city on foot, from its wonderful museums to excellent pizza (we managed six pizzas in 72 hours and I'm still now quite sure how!). The apartment truly felt right in the middle of everywhere we wanted to be.
Thanks to the new Avelo flight from our hometown of Charlotte, I'm sure we'll be back someday - and I'm glad to know where to stay when I return!"

Stayed over a week","We stayed in this apartment for a month prior to a full-time move to New Haven. The apartment was exactly as pictured - no unhappy surprises after checking in! It is a 3rd floor walk-up but we didn't find the stairs a burden. All instructions were clear. Everything was spotless, the bathroom in particular is updated and modern, with a great shower. The kitchen has a dishwasher and small fridge, and there are two AC window units, which were handy during one week of high heat and humidity. There is a coin-op washer and dryer in the basement but we opted to take our clothes to a laundromat (the Wash-Tub in East Rock) to save having to do multiple trips walk up and down the stairs, and dig around for quarters. FYI, the neighborhood is close to I-91 so you hear traffic noise. Otherwise, the area is very walkable, and felt quite safe."

It was my first time in New Haven and the city overall didn't feel particularly safe after dark, especially the part of town where the house is (very few people walking, some dark streets in the neighborgood), but walking during the day was perfectly fine, and if you are driving this would probably be much less of an issue.

Stayed a few nights","The house was clean and had ample space for us. I am used to some more essentials and toiletries in Airbnbs, so we had to make a run to the store for basic things like olive oil, pepper, as well as shampoo and soap for showering and laundry detergent for washing a load of clothes. I also would have appreciated extra blankets in the bedrooms. These are just nice, hospitable basics and I think cost the host very little, so I would encourage Paul to have these on hand for future guests."

It was an unfortunate last minute trip for us, but Paul did everything he could to make our stay the least stressful part of our sudden trip. His place was great. Clean, spacious, nicely decorated, and had everything needed....... Coffee, toilet paper, plenty of towels, well stocked kitchen. Great neighbor who is very friendly, the sun room is perfect for enjoying the mornings in. The beach is a short walk, and has a nice park. Paul was an ideal host. Made sure we checked in ok, and left us alone unless we needed anything. The basement is a nice touch with the video games. Plenty of restaurants near by, with no shortage of great pizza. Would stay here again without hesitation, and highly recommend this place."

The home was beautiful, rooms were spacious, and the neighborhood was adorable! My one and only critique would be to offer a few fans to use throughout the rooms, because the comfy down comforters were a little stifling in the moderately warm + humid summer nights. Otherwise, everything was absolutely perfect. Our group of 6 was more than comfortable, and we'd 100% stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Okay, so to begin I am a wife and mother to a 2 year old and a 7 month old. On the spur of the moment my family and I decided to book a getaway , and spend Easter with loved ones in Connecticut. As a family of four we needed to prioritize functional accommodations (remember 2 very little humans) BUT we also wanted a place to stay that would make us never want to leave…. And this is exactly how I would summarize our stay and experience! Our host Paul was INCREDIBLY thoughtful ( he purchased utensils specifically for my kids so we could be completely comfortable and at ease). Paul also made sure to include a playpen and safety gates for his smaller guests . He is gracious and made it clear that he was available for anything that we might need; also, he is a great resource to anyone who might not be familiar with New Haven. In addition to our host, the best part of our stay was of course was this HOUSE! If we didn’t go or do anything else but stay in this house we still would have been very happy. The house is beautifully styled and furnished, with artistically modern touches. Geometrical and steel light fixtures adorn the walls and ceilings throughout the house, and bedrooms can be distinguished by the musically and sci-fi inspired art decor ( we stayed in the “Jimi Hendrix room”) You can rest your head next to Pink Floyd’ album cover or wake up with Darth Vader’s dark side to greet you. Not tired because your 2 year old decides she’s too excited for you to sleep? That’s cool, pass Jim Morrison on the way to the heated screen room where you can sit and relax while she is distracted by the sweet greenery. Hungry much? Obviously and always is the answer in my family. The kitchen has every amenity/utensil created or imagined. It comes prepared for every walk of human; from the grill master to the microwave chef, it will have everything you need to prepare, cook, serve and enjoy your meals. My above all else feature that I loved about the house? The sunshine. Natural sunlight pours in and lights up every single room, but it can also be dialed back and effectively muted all together. On mornings when we weren’t quite ready to be conscious, we could simply leave the shades down until the coffee did it’s job. Overall, we are thrilled that we discovered this gem in New Haven, and look forward to planning our next stay here (if it’s available:)"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very good value. I had no issues during my stay.
There's ample street parking, but it can get tight on street sweeping days. The southbound side sweeps on Mondays from 7 AM-3 PM. The northbound side sweeps on Tuesdays from 7 AM-3 PM. On those days, you'll need to exercise care in parallel parking and avoid blocking driveways.
Entering and leaving the property requires going up and down stairs both inside and outside the property. These aren't well lit in the dark, so be careful negotiating them."

I come to the area often now for work, and this has been like a second home. Just an extrmely comfortable clean home, and as I said in an earler review, Katy and Bill are great hosts and are there quickly if you need anything.
If want to visit downtown it is a quick Uber ride and cheap. There were occasional guests there at times, and sometimes was completly alone for days. The guests were always respectable of the space, and I look forward to returning here as much as I am in the area.
Love the laundry on site too!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for a few weeks for work.
The good:
-Katy is very nice and responsive / in the building and comes by to check in.
-Secure keypad/lock that is easy for check in
-Window unit ac (it was hot!)
-Nice kitchen facilities
The ok:
-This is a shared airbnb with several other guests. It's good value for money (which is why I gave it a mostly very high rating) but if you're a light sleeper, it's a roll of the dice who you will get as housemates. Week 1 was great. Week 2 one housemate kept weird hours and I slept very badly (yes I use earplugs). There are a few bedrooms - mine was #6 and was between the kitchen and bathroom so you really heard it when folks moved around. The other rooms might be a bit quieter.
-The bugs bite at night - Not sure how they get in - the front door? Gaps in the window ac? Cracked bathroom window? but I always woke up with many bites. New Haven / not airbnb's fault but pack long sleeves/pants to sleep in.
All in all - good place and would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","First of all, the place has everything with everything and shows that the host is respectful and professional. My room (n. 6) was simple and spacious. The common areas were clean and commodious, I felt very comfortable. The communication with the host was exceptional. Kate responded to my many questions immediately.
Beware of the narrow stairs, a bit difficult when carrying heavy luggage.
I am only a bit reluctant about the neighborhood, it didn't feel very safe, so we avoided walking after 7 and always used Uber (the house has cameras though, and I didn't feel unsafe while being there) and the linen, which didn't feel very fresh. Apart from I was very happy with my stay.
Overall, the price is excellent for what you get and I would stay again: it is generally close to the center, the host is great, the interior is very well maintened and equipped."

Bill was kind enough to help me with my luggage, and Katy gave me a heads up notice one of my days there about moving my car to avoid getting a parking ticket (which I ended up getting on account of me, smh). Besides that snafu, my stay was nothing short of wonderful. Bill and Katy made some great recommendations for restaurants (included in a lovely welcome card that they left for me), parking (for the most part) was easy-breezy (I was able to park directly in front of the house, a house up or down, or across the street), washer/dryer (coin-based) is located right in the basement and included detergent/dryer sheets, my roommates/flat mates were super friendly (usually Yale students, employees, or hospital staff), location is ideal and convenient, and the place is 100% clean and smells fresh. You will absolutely enjoy your stay, and I recommend 100%!

Stayed over a week","We stayed at Michael’s place for 10 days and that was our best AirBnb experience ever. Every aspect of our visit exceeded our expectations.
The apartment’s decor left us truly impressed. The thoughtful design choices and the attention to detail in each room enhanced our overall comfort and made our stay all the more enjoyable.
Michale provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay. From the well-stocked kitchen to the extra amenities that anticipated guests’ needs, it was evident that he went above and beyond to ensure his guests felt at home.
The location of the apartment was ideal for our needs. A Yale shuttle stop is a 2-minute walk away. The off street parking is very convenient and safe.
We highly recommend Michael’s place to anyone visiting New Haven!"

Although we brought most of our own food supplies, the kitchen is stocked with everything we would have needed for our 3 nights of snacks, coffee, tea, juices, milk, eggs, condiments and a bottle of wine - as well as a few meal options. Everything from the decor to the supplies and accessories is first class, clean and professionally decorated. It appears to have been recently remodeled and is as clean and comfortable as anyone could ever hope for. Beds are comfortable and bedding impeccable. Parking is conveniently located at the side rental entrance and is well lighted with security motion lamps. Door locks and overall security is top notch.... 2 1/2 baths are a total plus for a two-bedroom rental with large well stocked walk in showers and closets. It's an easy 1.5 mile walk to the center of Yale/downtown restaurants and theaters. I will stay here again if and when I'm in the area. Thank you Michael."

Super clean and beautiful decorated space. On top of everything, Michael had included a few essential groceries- above and beyond what I’ve seen any host do. It was so extremely helpful esp with little ones to not have to make a trip to the supermarket while getting settled in. If I’m back in the new haven area, I would stay here without a doubt.

Stayed over a week","To me, a perfect Aibnb property stikes the balance between the space and comfort of staying in a friend's home and the touches and amenities of a luxury hotel. Michael's property nails this. The home is spacious, and well-appointed with great linens, towels, and a kitchen that contains just the right amount of items without being cluttered. The baths are really well done and stocked with Tommy Bahamas toiletries and little touches like a nightlight, shower cap, cotton balls, etc. Check in and entry to the home is really easy with a keypad. Great Tvs and other extras like extra pillows, blankets, iron, and luggage racks-- there's even bikes and helmets if you want to venture out. Oh...and everything you need for your first breakfast in the home without having to visit the grocery store. Definitely one of the most well-appointed properties I've had the pleasure to visit. And Michael is very responsive if you have a question. Will definitely return to when I visit New Haven."

It's beautiful and tastefully decorated... very modern and upscale while also being very comfortable. Just the right balance. A few of the things we really loved: all the fun memorabilia and unique furnishings, the luxury toiletries and linens in the bathrooms, the well equipped kitchen, the comfortable beds, and the little notes here and there with clear instructions about how to operate everything from the dimmer switches to the Keurig machine. Nothing was overlooked. What we REALLY appreciated though, were the extra touches. Not only did Michael welcome us with a bottle of wine (so nice after hours in the car) but he also stocked the fridge and cupboards with breakfast essentials and all the fixings for coffee. We highly recommend Michael's home and plan to return at some point ourselves when we're next in CT."

Not to mention the KITCHEN amenities: fully stocked coffee and tea bar, fridge stocked with essentials (eggs, cream, milk, condiments, butter), pantry with essentials (pasta, mac and cheese, oils, spices)...BATHROOM amenities: shampoos, etc., hair dryers, hotel-like products. 3) Location: Perfectly situated right on the edge of Yale's campus, so you can easily walk to the center of the University and also feel a little separated from the night life. Very quiet. 4) Comfort: Beds and living spaces so spacious. Beds were so comfy, and I'm picky :). 5) Communication from owner: Owner was incredibly responsive. Even helped me with a mistake I made with the alarm system so quickly! He checked in on us to make sure we were all good numerous times and was flexible with check in. Wonderful overall.

Stayed a few nights","Billy and Amy’s place is perfect for visiting downtown New Haven and Yale. We live only a few blocks away, and had our parents staying in the apartment while they visited us; the space was central, accessible, and perfectly set up. Though our parents did not use the coworking space, it is also set up extremely thoughtfully and with everything you need for remote work. The bedrooms, bathroom, and kitchen are well appointed and have lots of little touches to make guests feel welcome.
Finally, Billy and Amy were amazing hosts: they were flexible and extremely helpful when my family accidentally left some things behind after checkout. They coordinated with us and did everything possible to make it easy for us to retrieve them; we were extremely grateful.
The apartment has everything you need for an enjoyable, easy, fun stay in downtown New Haven; we would definitely return!"

Stayed a few nights","The location was ideal for visiting Yale with everything being walkable even for my 75 year old mom. It is a busy area with bars and restaurants. I am a light sleeper and was happy to bring my earplugs. The third bedroom allowed 5 of us to use as a living room and the kitchen dining room had seating for all of us to gather. We appreciated having no trash take out, bed stripping and other cleaning requirements besides tidy up if you can. That made check out and getting to the airport much easier. Again for us the location was absolutely the best."

The property's location is in easy walking distance of Yale University hospitals and schools, as well as New Haven eating and shopping spots. Really good cafes, restaurants, and shops are just a few blocks away. Off-street parking is available, which is convenient if you have a car. I would definitely stay here again with my family!"

Clean crisp uncluttered decor. Some spices and coffee and keurigs, syrups and non-dairy creamer supplied, so it felt very welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay!"

The driveway is very skinny and in very bad shape. I had a compact car which fits in, although, any larger cars would be a problem with the trash cans also there. This I think was not well described. The place in general is fine and kitchen is well equipped. Bathroom a little too small and I had WiFi issues the first day connecting. I was there for 4 days and it worked fine the other days. Overall, I felt that the first stay (Mansfield St) property which is right next door was a lot better property and more value for the price. The bedroom and bed were fine and clean. Linens were very good."

Also the desk was perfect for working. Improvements would include unclogging the bathtub drain, providing toilet paper in the bathroom (not just in the bedroom), and blackout curtains in the bedroom. The multiple door codes was a little complicated but manageable - to lock the bedroom door you need to hold the ""#"" key. The hosts were responsive, helpful, and friendly. I felt safe in the neighborhood. Great value, especially if you can get a parking spot."

- Very good location in a neighborhood quiet and close to downtown.
- Very well equipped kitchen
- Very comfortable bed and quiet room
Communication with the owners is excellent and they respond very quickly with solutions.
As negative things I would highlight the inability to use the laundry machine ( panic to go down to that basement) but there is an excellent laundry room nearby. The other thing is that you are lucky with your colleagues as these can be noisy and bothered in the evenings.
In conclusion, a very good place for long stays with good value for money without great luxuries and recommended. I would repeat"

Stayed one night","It may be that rooms this close to Yale (1 mi) always cost $100+, but this is not a good neighborhood. Trash and an abandoned couch from next neighbor on the street blocked the sidewalk.
The THREE locks needed to get to the room are v hard to make work.
Also, we were not expecting to share a bathroom w three other units on the floor. (No doubt I failed to read the description closely.) All in all, I think it is over-priced."

Stayed over a week","I stayed in the Rosemary room for the fall semester. Overall, it is great value. The house is older but has everything needed for a comfortable long-term stay. Naomi was generally quick to respond to requests. I’d recommend this to anyone who is budget conscious and not too fussy about cleanliness."

Not much of a nightlife (I mean we are still in a pandemic) but the neighborhood is quiet and there is a cute little coffee shop right down the hill. But okay, back to the room. There are 2 longer term tenants that are super friendly. It is an older house and things creak so we had tobe mindful of coming and going. All in all would definitely stay here again if I come back to New Haven."

Stayed one night","I'll start by saying that the location is wonderful and the room itself is clean. The kitchen and bathroom were not as clean but we didn't need to use the kitchen so that was fine. For the price, it was a good deal. The permanent resident there is super nice -- he offered us a fan to cool down the room when we arrived to find there was no AC (the listing has AC in the description) and the high temperature for the day was in the 90s. But because the room is located on the top floor, the air felt like 100F. The host did offer to get one for us after we asked for one and was good at responding to our messages quickly."

Stayed a few nights","My review is to be up front in the expectations of this listing. The room is just as described, clean modern furniture. It is a quiet area except for some road noise. It is a room on the 3rd floor with narrow stairs. You are sharing with a permanent tenant and possibly another airbnb guest. There are cameras in the common areas (kitchen and lounge area). The room itself has it's own locked door. The kitchen (I did not use because I didn't need to but probably wouldn't because of some of the cleanliness) and bathroom are shared. The bathroom I had to use but it was not kept for guests. One clean towel per person was provided which was not a problem. I hung them in our room to dry for the next day. No washrags or soap were provided.
The heat did not work. I found a space heater in the closet which sufficed for our room but the bathroom was cool when showering. I messaged Naomi late that evening and she responded the next day. She promptly had someone come fix the heat that day; however, on our third evening it was not working again (old system). We did not report it again since we were leaving.
There was a note taped to the bathroom door explaining that sleep was important, a calm atmosphere is needed, and to reduce the number of times you use the bathroom in the evening unless it is absolutely necessary. I believe the permanent resident posted this note.
All in all, it is a great value for a place to sleep."

The flat was located in a walking distance from Yale uni, restaurants and shops. My daughter and I could walk to many places without any problems. It was a fantastic place to stay for people who come to New Haven for the first time. It was a clean, beautifully decorated room. We felt like we were at home as soon as we stepped into the room.
We recommend this place to everyone. Thank you Katelin. X"

Walkable to the city and so many great restaurants around. You get your own parking spot. There is a coffee machine in the building that we used frequently as it makes different variety of coffee. The amenities here are absolutely amazing.
The bed is very comfortable and the showers water is hot."

The place was absolutely spotless and very nice overall, however, the host needs to at least get a few pans for reheating pizza, as we are in New Haven after all! Lol

Hosting company communicated well and promptly, which I appreciated. Pleasantly decorated, bed was comfy, basic equipment and supplies provided, but would have appreciated a sponge and tea towels in the kitchen and only 2 coffee mugs (even as a single guest I would have preferred a few more). Easy to park next door and easy to get where I was going. The neighbourhood itself is not charming, but I felt perfectly safe, so suitability of location would suit depend on your purpose for visiting."

Lager is good, you are quickly in town, there is a park next door. You feel safe as everything is video-monitored.
At night can get a little louder because there is a hospital nearby and there is just ""Tatütata""…
It is definitely better to book directly with Hyatus and not through Air B&B, so it doesn't save.
However, we were very satisfied!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was wonderful to stay in. There were times throughout our stay when we needed further assistance and they communicated to us right away! They were so friendly and the guide/instructions they give are so clear and helpful! We have stayed in many places before, and their instructions were the clearest we have ever seen! If you go to this location, they have a cute smoothie place Solbol near by and a small park across the street. The apartment was spotless and so organized it was lovely. The kitchen has lots of pots and pans, but you would need to bring baking sheets/cupcake tins if needed. It does get a little loud at night due the hospital being close by and some neighbors upstairs wake up early in the morning. The amenities made this place even more amazing! We went to the 24-hour gym every night and had dinner on the rooftop at sunset it was absolutely gorgeous. I would recommend this stay for anyone who wants to have a relaxing stay this team did a great job! Thank you!"

The apartment is in a great location if you want to be close to the medical school, research labs and hospital.
It is also a few minutes walk from Union Station, city center, Yale University, museums, restaurants,...
The check-in process was easy by following the instructions .
The messages from host Jhanice were clear and charming.
It's a very nice place to feel at home.

I really appreciated all of her help and hospitality! The airbnb itself was beautiful, sunny, clean, well maintained, and stocked with all of our necessities. We could occasionally hear the footsteps of the upstairs neighbors but we had no noise issues at nighttime. The place is in a quiet area, and combined with the blackout curtains, we were able to sleep great. We also appreciated the close proximity to the Yale area (only about a 10-15 minute walk), while being able to come back to the less busy part of town. We will definitely be staying here again and would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Jhanice and Hyatus!"

I had to make a last minute change and they were very accommodating and fair.
Communication was excellent as well.
I felt it was a bit different than other Airbnbs I have stayed, more hotel like in some aspects (but a nice hotel). That makes sense as they are running a business, not renting one unit.
I would not hesitate staying here again due to location. It really checks all the boxes."

Apartment was clean and tidy. Some items needed attention (the sliding closet door was hard to work with!) but it was a nice little garden level apartment, perfect for a couple. We booked on Yale reunion weekend, so was on the pricey side. Easy parking right out front, and great communication from our hosts. It'd be nice if there was another sign above the toilet (instead of the flushing instructions) that was more ""homey"" and gave this apartment more of a unique feel, but that is a minor issue. In the end, it was a nice, clean, simple AirBnb in a good location."

I have daughter who lives in East Rock and it’s really difficult finding a place to stay that doesn’t require driving downtown or getting a cab to stay at a hotel. I could walk everywhere from the guest suite. There are loads of restaurants and businesses close by. I’m just worried that the more people find out about this accommodation , it will be harder for me to book it when I need a place to stay! I will definitely be returning."

Stayed a few nights","This is a cozy, simple basement flat in a convenient area of the East Rock neighborhood of New Haven. Easy walk to the downtown area, plus many bars, restaurants, and cafes in the neighborhood itself. There’s no kitchen, so longer-term stays may be difficult, but the bed is comfortable, the bathroom clean, and the amenities (smart TV, coffee machine, electronic kettle, WiFi, etc.) reliable. Check-in is a breeze, and the hosts were helpful and quick to respond. The only downside is that it’s very easy to hear noise and footsteps from the apartment/home upstairs, which during our stay contained children who woke up very early each day — so maybe bring earplugs if you’re a light sleeper who wants to sleep in!"

This apartment not only enjoys a prime location in a quiet and secure neighborhood but also precisely matches the images shown—offering a cozy, immaculately clean, and tastefully decorated living space complete with all conceivable daily necessities. I was particularly captivated by the skylights, which serve as natural painting frames, showcasing ever-changing, enchanting vistas at various times of the day.
As for the hosts, Colin and Shelley excel in their roles. They are attentive, warm-hearted, and provide crystal-clear instructions for both self check-in and check-out procedures. Throughout my stay, they were incredibly responsive and accommodating to my needs, which were minimal given the apartment's comprehensively stocked amenities.
In summary, my stay was thoroughly enjoyable."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Skylight was just as expected based on the listing. It’s a beautiful, fully appointed, clean and charming place. Our hosts were very helpful and responsive. It’s a little removed from the Yale campus but the neighbourhood is pretty with lots of trees and it’s walkable. Our only complaint would be the construction next door but we were given fair warning about it. We’d definitely stay again!"

It was so relaxing to come back to this bright clean, uncluttered, but cozy home at the end of the day. It is a great location --very walkable, with two beautiful parks in walking distance: East Rock Park and Edgerton Park, and a 5 minute walk to the Yale shuttle, which takes you into downtown and the Yale campus. Also, Colin is always responsive if you have a question or a problem. I highly recommend staying here!"

The house is exceptionally well lit from the natural light coming in and has been beautifully done up in hues of white, beige and light grays which make the space look brighter, more lit up and spacious. The location is also comfortable for a walk/shuttle ride to campus (close to a blue line stop). Would highly recommend the place."

Stayed a few nights","Unit was spotless and exactly as described. Communication and instructions for access and departure was very friendly and comprehensive. Apt was ideal for visiting our son at Yale, walking distance to north side of science campus through quiet residential neighborhood, with safe, well treed and shaded streets. Parking easy on street and behind building. The apartment was obviously renovated with care recently and well furnished with everything we needed, with lots of handy extras like extra bedding, hair care products, a well equipped full kitchen with good assortment of kitchen basics including seasonings, sugar, tea, coffee, etc. All appliances were new and worked well, including full stove with oven as well as microwave, drip coffee maker, toaster, etc. Internet very fast with good TV service. Lots of windows plus multiple skylights with blinds make unit bright and cheerful, with attractive furnishings and hardwood floors. Unit is on third floor which means several stairs up as described accurately, but we had no issues with this; stairs were well lit and again attractive hardwood, and result is you occupy the top unit which is especially bright and quiet. The week we were here New Haven was especially hot and humid, reaching over 95 deg most days, but the new central AC in apartment was brilliant, capable of making the entire space as cool as anyone might want despite high temperatures outside. All in all one of the best apt shares we have found, well done!"

It is beautiful, the beds are super comfy, and the kitchen and living room area a dream. The place is bright and sunny; however, if you don't want the sun in your eyes early in the morning, use the remote to close the high tech shades on the sky lights. Shelley and Colin are also the nicest hosts with excellent communication. Their place is in a quiet neighborhood and close to great restaurants, cafes, and everything Yale. We'd love to stay with them again. Thank you Shelley and Colin!"

The apartment had all the essentials and more. And The kitchen!!!! The kitchen and sunlights is why we booked the place.
The hosts were easy to reach and helpful. They had the top seaming services, usually we end up logging into our accounts, not here.
The place is close (10 min drive) to everything including a target. The hosts had a list of great recommendations which included this amazing ramen spot. And I’m from NYC. Overall it was a lovely stay."

While we were there, one of the door locks malfunctioned, and he fixed it immediately. In addition to the place being so beautiful and relaxing, it is also located near the Yale bus line so it is within a ten minute walk to get to a bus, which will take you to downtown New Haven and Yale. The neighborhood affords a beautiful walk if you are a walker who enjoys historic homes and lovely old trees. Will definitely stay there again on my next trip to New Haven if it is available."

The apartment is beautifully decorated and filled with literally everything I could have needed during the stay. The hosts were super quick to respond when I had an issue connecting to the WiFi and it was nice to know that if I needed anything they would be responsive and quick to help!
The skylights and many windows in the apartment create the most beautiful atmosphere throughout the day and all of the windows and skylights have blinds you can use at night for privacy.
For anyone traveling during the covid-19 era, I felt more than comfortable staying here in terms of this. The unit appears to be on its own hvac unit and is completely separate from the other units in the building with the exception of a shared hallway to get to the door to the unit entrance. The apartment was also sparkling clean when I arrived!
Thank you so much to the hosts for making it such a lovely experience and I hope that I find myself back in CT to stay again sometime!"

Stayed over a week","Shelley's AirBNB is absolutely beautiful! Located about a 3 minute drive from Yale University, this listing really is a hidden gem. We were looking for a nice getaway during New Years and found Shelley's 3rd floor skylight apartment. It completely exceeded our expectations! The inside is beautifully decorated with high ceilings and pleasant décor. Since it's on the top floor, each room has a spacious skylight window in the ceiling that allows a good amount of natural light in but not so much that it's blinding. At night, these skylights can either be closed using a touchpad on the wall which is really convenient, or used to gaze at the stars from the comfort of the apartment. The kitchen is extremely spacious, with plenty of counterspace, a gas stove, a dishwasher, and a fridge with a water/ice dispenser. The living room is definitely the center of the listing, with a nice big Roku TV already equipped with streaming services on it. The couch is comfy and the coffee table is nice and sturdy while you settle in and watch TV. The bedrooms are spacious and both have big, soft beds that are irresistible to just climb into after a long day. The bathroom has a nice sink with good counterspace, and the shower has great water pressure. On top of that, the bathroom has its own skylight right over the shower! There is a driveway with a small back parking lot and there is street parking. While our experience at the AirBNB was amazing, having Shelley as our host made it unforgettable. Shelley was extremely responsive from the moment we booked the listing until the last day. We so appreciated her hospitality and kindness during our stay. She gave us updates about anything that might be going on around/in the house, like gutters being installed or walls in the hallways being painted. She was very transparent about everything and responded to any questions we had within an hour or two. All in all, we absolutely loved our stay there and we'd be so happy to go there again!"

So big and airy and bright, with windows on all sides, including overhead - yes the skylights are real, gorgeous, and there are about 6 of them. The kitchen is dreamy, and everything else is in order. I was there for 3 nights with my partner and it was a perfect escape. We were wary of traveling during covid, but this place felt so clean and trustable. It's tucked away on a quiet street, which was fine because we had a car. The views out the back window at sunset are incredible because you can see for miles. Great view of West Rock. Good couch/tv setup, lots of bathroom amenities and toiletries, good, easy laundry. This was airbnb-ing at its best."

Stayed over a week","This was the best experience I've ever had staying at an Airbnb.
First -- the space. It was spacious without losing any charm, the furniture and decorations were elegantly minimal without feeling dorm-y, and the kitchen was large, gorgeous and so fun to cook in. It's the only experience I've had where the place is even nicer than the pictures. The bedrooms were both large and very comfortable. And for being in a city like New Haven, it was refreshingly and serenely quiet!
As for the host -- Colin was extremely helpful and responsive to everything that came up during our stay. He even brought us a care package. At one point the water was an odd color -- something was going on with the city -- and Colin immediately responded and even offered to bring us whatever. He went above and beyond the call of duty! (The water issue had nothing to do with Colin, but was fixed quickly anyway).
Overall it was the exact restful and restorative place to stay that I was looking for. I can't recommend it enough."
