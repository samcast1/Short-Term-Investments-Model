One regret is that the washing machine was broken, so I only used it a few times, but thank you for the proactive response from the landlord."

Stayed a few nights",I needed a week stay at Ft. Stewart and this place cannot be beat for price and convenience being 5min from the main gate. Very private with its own entrance and driveway. It was extremely clean with a big TV and amazing water pressure in the shower. The only issue I had was when the gate latch broke and the hosts fixed it immediately when I let them know. Overall a great value for anyone needing a place by the base!

Stayed with a pet",Emily was extremely accommodating of our dogs and the yard was great for them to run and play. We had an issue with the air conditioner when we first arrived and Emily had someone out first thing the next morning. Ultimately the unit needed to be replaced which was definitely an inconvenience but Emily had it taken care of as soon as possible and offered a refund for our inconvenience. The location is a perfect halfway point with our friends in Florida. We will definitely book with Emily again! Thank you so much for a great girls weekend!!

Stayed with a pet","This house was nice, clean, well-maintained….it was as advertised. This was not a business trip, so the location was not an issue. It was very nice to have a completely fenced in backyard so that my dog could be outside and not have the worry of having him wander off. The screened in porch was a wonderful place for morning coffee or an evening chat.
I did contact the owners as soon as I checked out the backyard to let them know that there were quite a few cigarette butts in the yard so that I wouldn’t be the one charged for smoking. They said thank you for bringing it to their attention and that I would not be charged for smoking."

Stayed a few nights","Emily was very accommodating and communicated well. The home was as described and had a very large fenced-in backyard. Lots of activities and games were also in the home. I'm only 5'3"", so I was unable to utilize the master bedroom as the bed was quite tall. A step stool would be a great item to add, given the height of the bed. The home is decorated very nicely. Quiet, nice, friendly neighborhood. Pulling out of the driveway is a little challenging as the neighbors have quite a few vehicles. Great value and very spacious. I would definitely recommend and would also stay again."

Group trip","This was a wonderful place to stay. There was plenty of room for all five of us. (All adults) The location was close to where we needed to go. The place was clean and there was lots of fun things to do. We were even able to park two cars in the garage.
On the down side,
-the kitchen was lacking in some of the essentials
-I received many messages from the owner listing all the rules, (and the consequences for not following the rules).
-the master bed was so high we had to borrow a step stool just to get into it.
Overall, we would stay here again, but I would bring along things for cooking and a stepstool."

Stayed over a week","This house is absolutely beautiful. A minimalist approach pulled off beautifully! Everything was clean, working, and I felt absolutely at home in her 4 bedroom, 2 bath home. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. She is super fast at getting back to you if you need her. A few things that we had to deal with was parking. Neighbors had quite a few cars and pulling into the driveway was always a challenge. The dishwasher would not close, we let our host know on the second day there and just started hand washing our dishes. All and all of you are looking for an amazingly clean and safe place to stay I recommend her house for sure. I will definitely look into rebooking if necessary."

The property was clean, the check-in/out process were very easy and her response time was great! If you’re looking for a nice neighborhood, this is it! It’s also close to the Walthourville meat market that has GREAT prices on seafood. Lastly, it’s an easy ride to Jekyll or Tybee so it’s a Win-Win. I would definitely rent from her again!

We traveled from NY to GA and this owner went above and beyond after hearing our story to help us out. His character said a lot to me. The place is simple, clean and open, which is perfect for a family. Fenced in backyard the toddlers loved! Neighbors were kind and lots of kids in the area. We stayed on new years eve and the neighbors shared their firework show with us, it was great. Definitely that southern charm kind of neighborhood. The Jacuzzi off the main room is a bonus and though we didn't get to use it much, the teenagers loved it! With the younger kids, the alarm system keeps you know when any door is open and that kept me sane, made me feel safe. Would absolutely recommend and rent again if we are in the area. Thank you again to the owner!!"

Stayed with kids",My group really enjoyed our stay at this house. We were in town to attend a graduation and this house fit our needs perfectly. The house was clean and comfortable. I would say that it does have the feel of a newer AirBnB in the fact that some cooking odds and ends were not available in the kitchen. Blankets in the bedrooms were also a bit thin/not high quality and only the master had a television. Huge plus was being able to do laundry in the spacious laundry room. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would book this house again.

Stayed a few nights","I had the pleasure of staying at an Airbnb hosted by Hong and I must say, it was an incredible experience. The home itself was absolutely beautiful, with stylish decor and all the amenities one could ask for. From the moment I walked in, I felt right at home.
The neighborhood where the Airbnb was located was equally as stunning. It was a peaceful and picturesque area, with tree-lined streets and charming houses. It was the perfect place to unwind and escape the hustle and bustle of city life.
Hong was a fantastic host, always available to answer any questions and provide recommendations for local attractions and restaurants. Their attention to detail and hospitality truly made my stay memorable.
I was so impressed with my experience that I am already planning to return to this Airbnb in the future. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful home in a peaceful neighborhood. You won't be disappointed!"

She even let us enter early during the hurricane. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again if we are in the area. Beautiful home.

Group trip","Mrs Hong was excellent in every aspect. Her Airbnb was even better than what the description said. She was very professional and made our renting experience very easy. We appreciate her prompt responses and whenever we consider to get away again we will not hesitate to reach out to her.
Lastly, we appreciate her honesty to the highest level. I made the last statement for two reasons. I left something that was very personal to me in her home and her cleaning crew found it. They informed Mrs Hong about what they had found and then she emailed me to let me know. After we communicated, we set up an arrangement for the return of my belongings.
That’s says a lot about what kind of person Mrs Hong is.
Thanks Mrs Hong , You’re the best 🙂"

Stayed a few nights","Carmen’s place looks great in pictures,
however upon inspection, not much cleaning get’s done. The damage to the walls was a bit unsettling as well as the neglected maintenance issues. The combination of these issues with the low income neighborhood made me not feel safe. Further gave me reason to believe that my car would not be safe; nor the personal belongings, therein. You will find ZERO parking. Carmen suggests that you can park off the street. However due to how narrow the street is and the uneven sparse grass area, you can not legitimately park anywhere near the residence. I did not stay at this unit. Due to the safety concerns, cleanliness issues and parking. However, I was only refunded a $35 cleaning fee."

That's the main reason we chose it in these days when airlines push you to carry-on only meaning that for long trips the laundry option is a must. But it was a pleasant surprise. Not huge but plenty big enough with very thoughtful layout and detail and with lots of snacks and everything we needed. Great location, super quiet, on the edge of woodland yet a few minutes from food and shopping places. Very clean and new. We almost didn't book as it's maybe not the prettiest from the outside but look past that as it's a hidden gem and we are glad we did. Will likely be back on future trips."

The attention to detail (like all the USB ports throughout the house) and access to any toiletries we may have forgotten was appreciated. We really enjoyed the generous serving of snacks, variety of coffees and creamers, and the amazingly well-stocked kitchen! There was even a cabinet full of spices for our use.
This home was perfect for our family of five. We also enjoyed all the games, grill, and backyard. With our son stationed at Ft. Stewart for at least the next four years, we definitely see ourselves back at Carrie’s place in the future. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Emily was wonderful from start to finish. The home was very spacious, clean and tidy . The Only downfall was there were only 6 towels for 12 people, the Kitchen supplies were limited to forks and spoons and a few knives. There was no salt or pepper or laundry detergent. BUT Our group didn’t mind at all and we actually went and bought more towels for our stay along with some other standard things like laundry products and some staple seasonings that we were happy to leave them for the next guest. Overall we were very happy and felt at home during our stay.
Thank you Emily!"

Stayed with kids",Although Emily was very nice I must say this was the worst Airbnb I’ve stayed in. All of the beds were very uncomfortable and the house had a terrible smell of animal. The upstairs television did not have a remote and the ceiling fan remote did not work. When we first walked in all of the smoke detectors were going off. We immediately called and she had someone come change the batteries and tightened the back door knob (we discovered it being loose during our walk through) The neighborhood was great and again the host was nice but the beds in all rooms according to my family and I were very uncomfortable! We ended up not staying the last night and just stayed with family 😩

Stayed a few nights","This house is absolutely beautiful. A minimalist approach pulled off beautifully! Everything was clean, working, and I felt absolutely at home in her 4 bedroom, 2 bath home. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. She is super fast at getting back to you if you need her. A few things that we had to deal with was parking. Neighbors had quite a few cars and pulling into the driveway was always a challenge. The dishwasher would not close, we let our host know on the second day there and just started hand washing our dishes. All and all of you are looking for an amazingly clean and safe place to stay I recommend her house for sure. I will definitely look into rebooking if necessary."

Also, rags weren’t in all rooms and they are overly used. Other than that, I wouldn’t complain. Very peaceful and clean."

The first thing that struck us was the sheer size of the home. With its generous layout and well-thought-out design, it provided more than enough space for our entire family. Each member had their own cozy nook to retreat to, ensuring privacy when needed.
Cleanliness was a top priority for us, and we were delighted to find the property impeccably maintained. The attention to detail in every corner was evident, as the home gleamed with cleanliness. We felt instantly comfortable and at ease, knowing that our hosts had taken great care to ensure a pristine environment for our stay."

Group trip","This house was clean, lots of space, comfy beds. Great for a quick stopover on a long drive. Since we were the second ones to stay in this new listing there were some things that we mentioned would've been nice to have there for guests. Garbage cans and bath mats in the bathrooms, coffee filters, coffee, salt and pepper, dish soap etc. We were very understanding that it was a brand new listing so it wasn't a huge deal but just would've been nice to have coffee in the morning :) Emily was very responsive to our messages and appreciated the suggestions and would get those things right away. Also, the backyard is not finished yet, so just dirt. No trampoline or pit fire as stated on the listing...but I am sure those are coming soon and will be fabulous additions! Thanks for a great nights sleep Emily!"

The location is quiet and close to base; which was top priority for my boyfriend. Super easy to find. My daughter who is only 3 loved all the game items even though she was too little to really play them; she made up her own games instead. Living room TV was great! The bedroom had a big TV too; it was a little finicky at times but still worked well. Over all it was a great experience.

I usually spend the first hour of being in an Airbnb wiping down the surfaces because they don't feel clean, but this place was exceptional! She thought of the extras that made traveling easier, like providing soaps and hair products. She also provides extra trash bags, toilet paper , boxes of Kleenex in each room laundry detergent and even a container of Q-tips in each bathroom. All of these extras are so nice! There are plenty of restaurants near by. We recommend Rodeo for Mexican cuisine it is about a 5 minute drive. This was a great stay and if we ever have to come back to the area we will for sure stay at Hong's place."

It was very quiet and peaceful for the most part. The neighbors did have a dog that barked for several hours one day but at least it was during the day when we weren’t trying to sleep."

For a family with young children there is a school at the end of the road with a great playground. Close to the downtown shopping area and restaurants.
Excellent communications with the host. We needed Hong's assistance on two occasions and she responded within 5 minutes and the issues were resolved expeditiously..

The home is nicely decorated. I love the big kitchen and the renovated refrigerator. The dining area was so nicely decorated as was the rest of the house. My favorite is the master bedroom. Beautifully decorated and spacious. Love the hidden ceiling fan in all the rooms.
Our host is very nice and was always available if we needed her. Debra was very helpful in some of the things we needed and very empathetic to what we needed.
This home and host will be our go to home away from home when we need it.

Group trip","I REALLY wanted to love this place! Positives: Newer home in a quiet neighborhood; accurate website description. Minor issues: Confusion with locating the property. The street address of the house is not what was provided. Rather, the address provided is to the business center, and instructions on how to navigate to the house from there were provided. Once we got to the house, we weren’t overly impressed. A couple pieces of furniture were broken, the towel bar and tissue holder in one of the bathrooms were broken, the mattresses were not the most comfortable and the amenities were very basic. Most of the beds were missing mattress covers and flat sheets. We were provided bath towels. No wash cloths. The only bdrm with a TV was the master. Major concerns: Soiled bedding in two of the rooms and a horrible ant infestation. One of the guests had ants crawling on her comforter and mattress pad and she was bitten. We were reimbursed a nominal amount for the inconvenience."

There are several bedrooms (with comfortable beds) and bathrooms to accommodate a family and or friends. The home was neat and clean and had a well stocked kitchen. Even though we brought a lot of wedding decor and food items we still had room spread out and live in the space. It was nice to have a full sized fridge/freezer to help with food prep as well. Although we did not use the backyard, it is a nice sized fenced in yard. We would highly recommend renting this home from Emily."

The home is in a great location….close to Ft Stewart, restaurants, Walmart and other grocery stores and shopping centers in the Hinesville area. The home was very nice and it accommodated my family’s needs during our stay there. We’re glad to know that Emily has a military family. We support our troops and. our veterans. Thank you for hosting my family in your home."

Stayed a few nights",This is my second time staying at Sony's Airbnb. I have stayed at many Airbnbs and this is my favorite place to stay. He is top notch in communication and hospitality. He goes above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. The home is beautiful and the beds are so comfortable. I love the pool as well. When I come to Savannah I will make sure that I always try to book at one of his properties. I wish every host on Airbnb could be as amazing as him. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you Sony for everything!

Stayed with kids","Sony's place was just as described on his page. My family and I traveled to Hinesville for an event in Savannah for my daughter's birthday and she never had a birthday vacation or anything special on her birthday, due to her just turning four years old. I asked Sony to please help me provide a surprise for her when we arrived at the home and he really went above and beyond to make it the best surprise arrival. When we got to the home, it felt like we were right at home. It's located in a quiet area with very friendly neighbors and just walking distance to local restaurants and stores. Sony provided the kids with books, games, and a PS4. What I really loved is that he provided flashcards and learning workbooks, even though the kids were out of school, they still had learning activities. When we started cooking, we realized that we were missing some items and thought we had to run out to the grocery store but Sony had already provided seasoning and a pantry filled. Highly recommended"

He even had charging cables at each night lamp. Our kids loved the pool and the cool lights on the sinks and showers. You really get your bang for your buck with this home.
The neighborhood is quiet and felt safe as well! Great place for a family stay!"

The place is great. I travel alone for work and all I want at the end of the day is a safe, quiet, relaxing space to come home to. This place checks all the boxes.
I only stayed for one night, but I can see people having a great time at this place as a group for a few days. There is a lot to do, the house is full of games and activities.
The pool looks great, I wish I had more time to enjoy it.
Sony was great at responding to messages and was very helpful with everything."

Stayed with kids","Our group of 7 (3 adults and 4 teens) stayed at Peaceful Hideaway on the way home from JAX to NC. We were all exhausted from our trip to Cuba and needed to rest and Sony’s place was perfect. We had plenty of room for the 7 of us to stretch out. The place was squeaky clean. There is a good selection of board games for the kids, Wi-Fi for streaming your favorite shows, a foosball table, nice backyard with fire pit and swimming pool. There are staple kitchen items such as spices, coffee, tea, and even some dry goods such as canned goods. Sony was easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again if we are in the area for any reason."

The first one I looked at I was like ummm no. Well second one I looked at was this place. The pictures didn’t lie. This house was awesome. Clean smelled good. It was nice. From starting off Sony was a great host. Immediate response back, checked to make sure everything was good and even sent some snacks over. This place was awesome. Hopefully my next trip to Hinesville will be here if it’s available"

The back yard is cozy and private but be aware there are biting ants in the grass.
The property is conveniently located only 3 miles from my son's house on the base. If I visit again before he's transferred I'd like to stay here again."
