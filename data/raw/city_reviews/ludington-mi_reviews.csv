Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time in Ludington and wouldn't have changed anything about our stay (except maybe the weather). The Lakeside Oasis was very nice, and far more spacious than we had envisioned it being. The complex is very nice and the location makes it the perfect launch point for anything you plan to get into around Ludington. I highly recommend this booking for someone looking for an extended weekend or vacation in the Ludington area."

Stayed a few nights","Very nice, small home near downtown Ludington! Perfect size for a couple with spacious living/dining/kitchen space that is all modern and updated. Well equipped throughout and very comfortable. The house is not downtown, although a short 2-3min drive (probably would be 15-20min walk to downtown proper) away and very easy to get around and in/out of town. Everything in Ludington is very accessible from the Airbnb, but if you want an easily walkable stay near downtown/beach/etc, this is probably a tad far away. Nonetheless a great space for an escape, and the town itself is well worth the trip!"

We were worried we may have to bring our dogs but we ended up not needing to. Lauren left us a gift and a hand written note when we arrived. Everything we need to responded within minutes. Even before the trip we had tons of questions and she made it so easy for us. Her home was BEAUTIFUL. Made it feel just like home. We will definitely be returning. I can’t thank Lauren enough for making our stay so wonderful during such a difficult time for us. I HIGHLY recommend staying here.

However, the bed frame broke with normal use and the host charged us for the cost to replace the bed despite the reviews online warning that the bed frame was prone to breaking and was of poor quality. Lauren offered us a free night for the trouble of sleeping on the floor when the bed frame broke, but we're opting not to stay with them again because we should not be responsible for a bed frame with no specified weight limit and known to be of poor quality breaking with normal use."

Stayed a few nights","The cons: The portable air conditioner was loud and only kept the living room kind of cold. We interpreted ""air conditioning"" as central air vs 1 single air conditioner. (Bring a fan)
The pros: Too much to list!!! This was one of the nicest Bnb's I've ever had. Truly a home away from home kind of feel. The kitchen was fully stocked with more than just the basics. Keurig, nice Cookware, Knifes/Utensils, SPICES, and more. The location was GREAT, closer to the beach than any chain hotel in the area. Plus there was a nice washer and dryer in the unit!"

Stayed with kids","This was a great last minute stay for us. It is the first floor of an old home that’s at the end of a neighborhood butting up to an industrial area. So, just bear in mind that is what it is. The house looks recently redone, was well decorated and had homey touches everywhere. Melissa thought of everything and had the kitchen fully stocked with everything we needed to cook, etc. My kids loved the window seat in the living room and I enjoyed that space as I had a couple of working days on vacation and worked from there. The backyard area has a grassy space with a fire pit and then another tier with a nice propane grill and picnic table. It was a great spot to eat with a nice water view! The beds were comfortable and we really appreciated that the house was pet friendly. Our dog enjoyed his stay as well. It was close to Ludington and easy to get to the main drag. We loved having the park right across the street (there’s a grassy path next to the big brick building), with playground and awesome splash pad for our kids. Overall, a good find and enjoyable place to stay if you’re exploring the area."

Could sleep 4 comfortably. The AC isn’t in the bedrooms but is in the main family room. The kitchen is fully stocked with very nice appliances! The Netflix already on the tv was a hit with our toddler. Very convenient. Love that!

Stayed with a pet",Had a wonderful time at Melissa’s place. It was just as pictured and Melissa was great at communicating and checking in. There is construction going on down the road from the cottage which makes getting to it a little round about. Didn’t really find it a problem though. It’s about 10 minutes from downtown Ludington.

Its about a 20 minute walk to the beach and less if going to restaurants\shops. Its a bit industrial but there is a water view. Bonus is that there is a new splash pad right across the street in the park. 20 mins drive to silver lake dunes. Quiet, clean, cute."

Stayed a few nights","Betrice took extra care and prepping the West wing for us. My boyfriend has reactive asthma and is very sensitive to fragrances and cleaning products, etc. I notified her in advance and she took care in cleaning with vinegar so there was no odor. I really appreciate this and it helped make the weekend I success. The West Wing is totally awesome. I would stay again for sure. Loved the sauna and hot tub. The location is gorgeous. Only three minutes to town with great restaurants and bars, but we almost didn’t wanna leave because the place was so cozy and comfortable."

Instructions were clear and plentiful, and Beatrice is a quick responding host. The place was spotless and roomy, and the indoor jacuzzi with Lakeview is by far the best amenity. The location is perfect. A couple miles north is the beautiful state park, and a couple miles south is Ludington city and public beach.

The place was very cool, secluded with a great view of the lake. The deck faced to the south looking onto the Lake . the wind was out of the north so we got to sit out on the deck and enjoy the sunshine without the wind. Everything was very cool and decor was coordinated with beach, lighthouses and fish themes. Didn't use the sauna, but the hot tub was awesome and it also was enclosed within the house and looked out over the lake. It was cool to see on the morning of the last day. Two white swans were swimming out in the distance.!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Betrice's place was perfect for my needs. She thinks of your every need and comfort. I went for 6 days of respite. I probably slept 15-18 hours a day. The bed was comfortable. The couch was firm but comfortable with the throw pillows and supplied fuzzy blanket. The kitchen was super well stocked. The furniture was stylish and sturdy. Betrice's decor is lovely, but not over the top. I was there Nov26-Dec2 and she had a little bit of Christmas out that made it fun. The sturdy beautiful high glass topped wood kitchen table was set with simple but stylish placemats, charger plates, beautiful white dishes and silverware. it was large enough for me to set up a sewing machine and serger and have room to layout fabric as well (and the height was perfect for a cutting table). Nothing was or looked cheap. The windows across the back of the place overlooked the large yard and river/lake at the back of it. The hot tub is easily large enough for 8, but wonderful for 1 as well."

Stayed a few nights","It was Great…. I would definitely recommend the location to other couples… Not what I initially expected but definitely still worth it!! This was our first Stay with Airbnb so when using the filter options while using the app, I was searching for specific requirements including ….. In Michigan, Property on a lake and a ""Entire Home""….When we got there it was a Guest Home connected to a Main House…Even though it was definitely still worth the price, extremely gorgeous & peaceful.. It wasn’t exactly what I was looking for.. so I looked at my trip info again, It says ""West Wing"" in Main Listing while also saying ""Entire Home"" in property description… Next time I’ll be more diligent in my research and clarify with Host.. maybe host can change the description.. Anyway, Your property is beautiful, you re an amazing Host and thank you for letting us enjoy your piece of paradise!!!"

The view from the back deck and when you’re in the hot tub is spectacular! We watched swans, geese, and ducks on the lake. There was a buck with a big beautiful rack that walked down to the water. They even have a set of binoculars there to use. It was one of the nicest getaways I’ve been to yet. The hot tub is clean and very comfortable. There’s even a shower right next to it to shower off.

Stayed a few nights","After a stressful couple of weeks for my business, I came to decompress. It was rainy and cool, and the trees were starting to change.
It was beautiful, sitting in the living room cuddled up on the couch with the fireplace going, listening to the owl outside and the patter of the rain on the lake.
The only downside, and it's laughably minor, are the utterly baffling (to me) light switches in the house. There are so many! And almost none of them do what you think they're going to do. But with a lot of on-off-on-off, I got things sorted out.
Super comfy bed, and the jacuzzi is wonderful after a chilly walk down to the lake in the morning."

We appreciated the natural setting with mowed paths leading to the picnic/fire pit area and private dock. The lake view from the patio is terrific and we enjoyed the momma deer and fawns visit every morning. We enjoyed paddling around the lake in the provided kayaks. The apartment itself is quite spacious and has a well furnished kitchen with modern appliances, smart TV with cable, and good internet service. The living area has comfortable furniture and is nicely decorated. The bathroom is decent size and the shower even has a shampoo/soap dispenser. The bedroom is a little snug with the queen size bed, but adequate. Overall this is a great place to stay and puts you within short driving distances to Ludington, the Ludington State Park, and many other attractions."

Note, however, that when we stayed there, there was no door between our space and the main house (where, I take it, the host lived) that locked and latched from our side. (The door to the sauna/spa area on their side locked only from their side, and they occasionally came in without notice to collect trash. The door to the sauna/spa on our side had a lock on our side, but we couldn't get it to stay closed.) This wasn't a big deal given how highly rated the host is; but it was still slightly uncomfortable."

The indoor hot tub and sauna were very convenient as we were traveling with our infant son - this way we could relax knowing we’d hear him when he woke up from his naps. The space was cozy but plenty roomy enough. I can be a little obsessive when it comes to clean towels and bed linens - I’m happy to say they were very clean and fresh. We appreciated how close the stay was to Ludington State Park. It was just around the corner and we visited several times. The best thing was the view - we loved being able to see the lake from wherever we were. The only thing that was less than ideal were the multiple doors connecting the space to the rest of the house. We had no locks on our side of the door to ensure they would stay closed. So it takes a measure of trust, but we of course had no issues whatsoever. We just tend to be more security minded. I would highly recommend this place!"

*It was difficult to achieve full privacy. The windows are floor to ceiling and beautiful! However; there are no blinds. There appeared to be a cover for the back doors but we couldn't figure it out. The main bedroom has beautiful french doors but no coverings and the doors are windowed. There is definitely no privacy for 'adult' time. Just something to keep in mind*"

It was a great little place to spend New Year's Eve. Ludington had a wonderful Local Ball Drop party which was fun. It was a wee bit strange that there are no window coverings, except for the big one that covers the balcony doors. Just caught us off guard. But not a big deal, as the houses are not right on top of each other. So no one is peeping on you. Absolutely loved the hot tub and sauna. Sitting in front of the fireplace was my favorite spot to sit the whole stay. It was just what the two of us needed. We had a great time staying here. I would book this place again for sure.

Stayed with kids","Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! Our stay was wonderful! We were able to make the west wing a perfect get away to the Ludington area for my wife, toddler, and I.
The location is quiet and serene. The view from the back deck overlooking the lake is routinely blessed with a family of 3-6 deer that come in every morning and evening to eat the tall grass and wildflowers growing. A nice pathway is cut through the tall grass to allow access to the canoes/kayaks and dock.
The home has no central air, but the copious windows allow plenty of fresh cool air in. At no point during our stay was the home too warm. A portable air conditioner is set up in the living room but we didn’t need to turn it on.
The hosts were kind and very attentive to our needs.
Many reviews discussed the privacy, and I know it’s been an issue for some people. The guest house is a wing of the main home. It is very private and only connected through the home gym/sauna/spa room. There are multiple doors separating the guest house and the bedrooms are opposite of a second garage not the main home. At only one point did my wife even hear the hosts in their house while we stayed.
We cannot wait to return!"

Stayed about a week","Betrice and her husband rent a clean, smart, and beautifully designed wing to their house overlooking the Lincoln River, accessible for kayaking, fishing, and hanging out. They were very helpful, responding within minutes to our questions re the unit and area. We appreciated being close to town and our son and daughter and their families in a rental near Stearns beach. Nearby, too, was Ludington State Park where we hiked the dunes, woods and strolled next to historic Lincoln River.
We especially enjoyed watching sunrises and sunsets from the deck, sharing moments with a family of deer grazing on native grasses and tree leaves.
We loved our stay here, wishing we had another week in this peaceful place. It was a gift."

Stayed a few nights","What can I say? Ludington is beautiful and the hosts were wonderful people! The pictures in the listing were accurate and the amenities were above and beyond. We packed light and nothing was missing from what they listed.
That said, as a frequent vacation rental user, it's good to share a couple of things. The entire place was spotlessly clean and convenient. However, you might want to consider shower shoes! Though a great design, the floor tile hurts your feet! The water pressure was VERY low, making it difficult to rinse.
Also, if booking in the summer, this place only has a portable AC. It's fine for days under 80. But above that, it stayed pretty humid inside."

All the little amenities too there was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, full kitchen sets, clean soft towels for showers & for the hot tub, it was all just right. The bed was so comfortable too! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. You're close to town and great restaurants and just a few miles away from Ludington State Park which is also spectacular. You will not regret booking this spot. They also have kayaks & fishing poles for you to use. We ran out of time to take advantage of those amenities but would have if we had more time! Thank you Betrice for providing us a wonderful space to celebrate our anniversary and get some time away from the day to day!"

The hot tub and sauna were easy to use, but be aware there are no blinds or curtains in this AirBnb. Again, the outside view is mostly nature but there is a child's playset right outside the window of the hot tub so maybe bring bathrobes. :) There were swans out on the lake, and a hawk that came often and must nest nearby. (there are binoculars by the french doors, such a good idea! We got coffee at Red Rooster Coffee in Ludington, and dinner at Ludington Brewery. Definitely on our list for future repeat-trips!"

The view of the lake from the house is gorgeous, and you can walk down to the dock for a better look. Had it been warmer, we definitely would have used the kayaks! We took a walk through the state park to see the Big Sable Point Lighthouse and it was beautiful, I definitely recommend it. The house had everything we needed. We used the TV, we played some of the board games they had available, and of course we used the hot tub and sauna. There were also pots, pans, a coffee maker, and other kitchen items that we used and really enjoyed having because we do most of our own cooking. Everything was great and Betrice was very kind and available for communication when we needed it. I definitely recommend this place!"

Stayed with kids","It was really a great stay for my family. we enjoyed the view, hot tub and sauna.
Its a good space for 2 adults only.
Few points to consider if you are family with kids (this is purely feedback purposes for others clarity)
1. lack of privacy, no blinds or curtains on the windows, although there was no one outside to peak in, but it felt a bit awkward while stay.
2. The sofa bed was very uncomfortable, not at all useful for sleepover. If you are a family with adults and kids, I would advise you to consider this point. (1 queen bedroom is super tight and has no space for crib or anything)
3. A bit expensive at the price for one bedroom space. (this is subject to market demand etc, but i paid more than other available spaces nearby.) No wonder, the hot tub and sauna was enjoyable. so One can consider that."

The sauna looked wonderful but we didn't have time to use it. The back yard is so lovely and peaceful! It truly feels like you're in your own secluded nature preserve. Lots of birds and wildlife and Lincoln Lake is very quiet, no motorized boats of any sort. Coffee on the deck in the morning was very relaxing! All of the amenities of the space were updated and easy to use. And a great location close to Ludington! Would definitely recommend and would stay again : )"

Stayed about a week","The west wing was exactly that; the west wing of the owners house. This was not clearly noted in the description prior to us booking. It has since been updated. The only major complaint I have is that there were 4 locked closets in the west wing, including one in the bedroom where we slept. We were there for a week and unable unpack any clothes and had to live out of our suitcases. This issue was brought up to the owners and we were told “sorry” and advised to store our suitcases in the office for the week. There are no blinds or curtains as well and the shower floor is cobblestone and rather hard on your feet.
Aside from these issues the place was the perfect distance from the state park and town. We weren’t actually in the unit a whole lot as we were in town for my sisters wedding so the week was pretty jam packed with activities. If the unit was updated to include closet space I would definitely stay here again."

I thoroughly enjoyed pretending that it WAS my home for a few days. The best part is that it is so close to Ludington State Park. My granddaughter and I were able to enjoy our days in the sand, on the beach, kayaking, bike riding and trail hiking just 5 to 10 minutes from our homebase. That made it so much easier to leave for the day without worrying about packing everything and anything we might need. It was easy enough to come home for lunch and head back out to our outdoor Wonderland."

He has a SUPER generous wood pile for use in the firepit, which my family enjoyed every night. I can't say it enough, he really thought of everything and I can't wait to go back. The best part is the peace and quiet. It's located about a 10 minute drive outside downtown Ludington. Hit the reserve button as soon as you see Austin's house available, you will not regret it."

Pantry was very well stocked. There was pancake mixes, jams, syrups, coffee, cereal etc. Firepit, barbeque, outside seating in a very private backyard all was good things to enjoy.

Located in downtown Ludington, near great breweries and restaurants. However, most hosts email me day before or morning of when I am going to get into town with check in instructions. I had to email this host through Airbnb to ask for check in instructions, but they did not respond. This was already after check in time. I had to end up calling them for check in instructions."

It is in walking distance to two great downtown hangouts; The Mitten (Sportsman’s Bar) & Ludington Bay Brewing. There is no shortage of good places to eat nearby. My family really enjoyed being able to take walks along the harbor and the beach.
The loft was very clean and spacious with a large kitchen. The beds were very comfortable! And my wife really liked the decor.

I doubt you can find a space as beautiful as this in the area at this price or any price. Aidan was very responsive and promptly answered all our questions. My girlfriend and I came here to Ludington to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. It was overcast and rainy most of the time so we did not get to do a hike we planned but we had such a great time staying in that it didn't matter. We had a wonderful time cooking, talking, relaxing, and watching a few shows in this beautiful apartment. The space instantly felt like home, that is if your home was designed by Martha Stewart. This is located in the heart of Ludington, you can walk to everything. If I come to Ludington again I will be staying here."

Group trip","Unit 4 is a clean, two-bedroom, two-bathroom, fully-remodeled apartment above a large furniture store on Ludington Avenue. The brickwork and masonry make the building appear historic, but inside the apartments everything is new.
The kitchen and bedrooms are large, and there is a small sitting area with a TV as well as a dining nook. There also may have been a TV and one of the bedrooms. There is a fold-out sofa bed in the sitting area, as well. Everything is bright and cheery.
Finding the location was easy. There was ample street parking nearby. I did not bother using the garage. There is no obvious elevator, so be prepared to ascend one large flight of stairs to arrive at the rental units.
There is quite a bit of road noise, even through the night, so I recommend closing the windows and using the air conditioning, even if it is a cooler night.
Regarding the host, he was accessible and accommodating. I made a mistake with our reservation dates, and when I called the host to request a change—after business hours on a holiday weekend—he immediately appeared in person and graciously amended the reservation at the last minute. Much appreciated.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would go back. Highly recommended."

The two king beds were perfect for my husband, toddler and I. This is the only unit with a tub so traveling with small children its great to have that accessible.
If you are a light sleeper may not be the best unit for you given it faces the main road and tons are gorgeous windows. The space is beautiful so wouldn't let this little thing change your mind on staying just like to note for others."

Stayed with kids","We would highly recommend staying at the Harrington Lofts!
We are two adults who stayed there with our two children (ages 2 and 6) for a long weekend in July. The location of this loft is incredible! It sits above a furniture store which means nighttime is quiet compared to other downtown rentals, but walk across the street and you have nightlife there!
The loft, #4, has two very comfortable king beds and a pullout couch great for kids. Finished such as quartz countertops and high end cabinets add to the upscale/modern feel and the keyed entry to the units adds an element of security (not that we ever felt a need for security but it’s nice to have that feeling of safety when traveling with kids).
We arrived a bit early but were able to check-in and go right to the loft which was great. Private parking is available behind the building but we parked right next to the entry most days which worked out well. This really is the perfect location. Walking distance to shops, restaurants, and bars. A quick 5 minute drive to the beach which could easily be done on bike too!
The only suggestions we have for improving the loft would be to add some area rugs and change from polyester sheets to cotton. We would highly recommend staying here and would come back ourselves."

Withing walking distance of Lake Michigan, and right on the corner of the main drag for easy access to shops and dining. Place is new, spatious, and modern. Kitchen is fully stocked although we ate out most of the time. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Has remote controlled AC. It is located on a busy (for Ludington) corner so if you are sensitive to noise in the morning that might be an issue, although it did not affect us with the fans on. There is one flight of 20 stairs to climb up to the lofts so a caution for some people. Check in is below in the furniture shop. Overall I would highly recommend and I would love to go back!"

She had it well stocked with all the basic necessities, plus many little extras. We were very impressed that a wagon, beach towels and beach toys were there for us to use.

Stayed with kids","Lake View Bluffs has far exceeded our expectations. This home was an experience. The owners have taken extra care to add special touches that make this home feel very luxurious. For example (and this certainly doesn't cover them all) lighting that dims and lights on a gradual delay, the home is consistent with a decorative theme throughout, the guest book/welcome book, is better than what you would find at a 5-star hotel, there were individual toiletry items left for use, ample pillows both decorative and plush ones for sleeping, ample cozy blankets, etc. The driveway is an experience with its whimsical twists and turns next to blossoming trees. The view is amazing, and the home makes great use of the view by incorporating many windows in which to take in Lake Michigan. The master bathroom is amazing with a soaking tub and a roomy shower for two. Even in the shower and bath, you can gaze out to Lake Michigan. Great hosts - Great location - Amazing kitchen - Sparkling clean!"

It is cleaned meticulously, rooms are spacious, decor is well thought out and furnishings make this a 100% property. I have stayed in some properties where you can tell the hosts are in it for the money and nothing more. However, with this stay and in this home, I felt like the hosts actually care about your visit.
The fire pit and picnic area are set up perfectly for intimate evenings by the fire or gazing over the water off the deck.
Truly an impressive property and I’m so incredibly thankful for the memories made this weekend."

Shawna and Chandler were very helpful, proactive and clear with all there instructions. The place was spotless clean, very fun, and very well set up. It was incredibly gorgeous, private, and helped make our day everything we dreamed of and more. As a place to get together with a group for a weekend, this place would be perfect. Beautiful, fun, and lots to do in the area. 10/10, can't recommend enough and would love to go back!"

There was one or two small issues: like the tub stopper didn't work (and though there was a kind of work around it wasn't perfect), and it wasn't clear that the property was really close to the giant hydro-electric plant in Ludington (which you couldn't see for the most part). We would easily stay there again-- hope they add a pool one day!"

There was also no blow dryer which when I email the host she there was one but it got stolen and she just had to replace it. The area was not a good area at all. That was the bummer. The downtown was close by but wouldn’t be comfortable walking there. The area is run down. The state park was beautiful and we had fun in the sand dunes.

There is a neat little wine taste testing establishment called Love Wines, LLC that’s walking distance from the home - def a must go if you stay here.

Not a bad walking distance to the SS Badger and downtown Ludington to go to breweries and such, but there is plenty to do at the lodge, itself. More than sufficient parking (we had 5 vehicles plus a motorcycle and an ATV trailer) and some space for inflatable twin beds in each bedroom if more bed space is needed. Very interesting furniture and decor, as well as some provided background on the location’s historical significance."

We walked downtown and it’s nice and close to everything! Everything was so clean and open! We also loved the decor and the history behind the building. Highly recommend this place to all!

The space was great for our group to hang out and play games for the evening. One suggestion is to bring absolutely everything you would need if you plan to grill or eat in the unit as nothing is provided.

The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms spotless. A bathroom upstairs and one downstairs both have magnifier mirrors--a big plus if you're over 40. We liked having Kurig coffee pods (a whole bunch) to choose from and a huge abundance of bathroom towels. We walked a block and were downtown shopping, dining and enjoying the holiday festivities. We would recommend this place and may just come back in the spring!"

The house was very clean and we were provided with plenty of towels, linens, toiletries, and all the other necessities. Shane also had a ton of other thoughtful touches available such as a candy bowl, bottled water, wine, condiment packets, popsicles, bikes for riding, TVs with streaming available in nearly every room, DVDs, board games, dog toys (pet friendly), etc. The house is within walking distance of lots of Ludington shops and restaurants (we loved ice cream at House of Flavors), including a nice park with playground. There is a nice beach within a 5 min drive of the house. Ludington State Park with gorgeous hikes and a beautiful beach is only a 15 min drive. Definitely a great spot for a family vacation.

Group trip","Jason’s place was clean and checkin was a breeze. He was communicative and was ready to provide us with clothes iron when we couldn’t find one as it was a brand new home , it is a well thought out and designed home. The basement will be a bit colder than the upper level but that’s something for you to keep in mind and is not a deal breaker! The house has 3 full baths. The bedrooms have soft mattresses but was comfortable even though I prefer slightly firmer!if I have to give a recommendation to Jason , it would be keeping better utensils in the kitchen . We do not prefer cooking in Teflon’s (non-stick ones) and definitely a strict No if it’s scratched, having a better option would be stainless steel and it doesn’t have to be expensive!
Also having more pots and pans would be beneficial!
Overall the bedrooms were well organized and stocked with essentials, and there was TV in every room ! Netflix in the living room was amazing, would have appreciated if the couch was comfy/recline!"

The house is arranged in a way that would allow for plenty of people to sleep comfortably and quietly while also providing a large common area on the main floor. At night we could hear the waves of Lake Michigan which lent a real beach feel to the stay and while we didn't make the trip (it was February, after all), it would be a very quick and easy walk to the water. As a host Jason continues to add thoughtful touches like a well-equipped coffee & tea station and baskets in each bathroom with personal items travelers may have forgotten at home. Highly recommended."

Jason checked in with us to make sure all was well.
The champagne and snack basket was very thoughtful.
Some of the pillows were rock hard and the house could have used more boxes of tissue (there was only 1 small box).
That is my only suggestions.

From the beginning, Jason was so accommodating for us with an early check in, the house was even more immaculate and cozy than in the photos, and we had more than enough room for us and our large family to really give us a home away from home feel. The location was absolutely perfect and although we stayed in the winter we would love to come back in the summer months because it’s walkable to pretty much everything including the beach! The amenities and attention to detail were endless from plenty of cookware and utensils, extra bedding, and we even were provided with toiletries and snacks for our convenience. We absolutely LOVED our stay and plan to be back!"

There were ample bathrooms (3 full bathrooms) and sleeping space (can comfortably sleep 8 adults) , and the kitchen was large and well stocked. The location is great as it is a 12 minute walk, or 3 minute drive to downtown Ludington. The arrival instructions and process were seamless and well communicated by Jason. The house had everything we could have needed and more (extra towels, extra linens, firewood, etc...). I highly recommend this house and Jason's hospitality!"

Stayed one night","Blue Dunes was luxurious and spacious and had the most amenities of any AirBnB or hotel I've ever stayed in. Our 3 kids had more than enough space to spread out and seek solitude. The living room and dining room had plenty of seating to accommodate family movies and dinners. The Marina, park, and restaurants were a 10-15 minute walk down the sidewalk. We visited in the middle of a weekend snowstorm and felt warm and spoiled coming home from our sledding and hiking adventures.
Jason was very responsive when I asked to stay an extra night. That was the only time I needed to contact him because the check-in and check-out were seemless and easy. He provides all needed information as well as area resources in a binder.
I will never book anywhere other than Blue Dunes for our future stays in the Ludington area."

Blue Dunes is far and above and beyond the BEST Airbnb we have ever had the pleasure of staying!
The home is amazingly large and beautiful-
Jason supplies all the usual amenities, and then tops it off with all of his many welcoming ""extras""- Welcome basket, toiletries, fully stocked Keurig, abundant plush blankets, extremely comfy beds, 3 large TVs complete with streaming services, and even slippers in the closets and dog food bowls in the pantry!
The location is perfect! A peaceful, quiet neighborhood a few blocks from the Ludington State Beach.
Jason supplies an information book on restaurants, beaches, and upcoming Ludington activities.
The pictures posted on the Airbnb site do not reflect the truly amazing home this is!
Our family has vacationed summers in the Ludington area for the past 30 years. This was our first winter experience- Incredible!!!! I can't wait to return soon!
Thank you Jason for sharing your beautiful home with us. 5 Stars isn't a high enough rating!"

We were lucky to be the first guests in this beautiful home! My husband Ryan, our pug Rocco, and I came to Ludington for a quick Valentine's weekend away. We were blown away by the luxury and comfort of the space.
I have stayed in many many Airbnbs around the world, and this one is by far the most inviting. Jason was an accommodating and friendly host and communicator. I appreciated all of the thoughtful design of the space, gorgeous furnishings and linens, the quality practical necessities, and generous treats offered.
The location of this house couldn't be better. Even in February, it was close enough to walk to downtown and the beach. Just a short drive, and we were at the dog park and trail to walk our pup on a beautiful wooded path.
We appreciated the house manual, the menus for local restaurants, the easy use of the Smart TV and coffee pot, and door locks.
All was perfection!
Thank you so much for hosting and sharing this gem!"

My only caution would be to step carefully down the stairs - we both fell on the first day, which was so odd that we had to investigate. Going down, the rise after the first step after the landing is an inch or so shorter than all the other steps. You get used to it quickly, but it took both me and my husband by surprise on the first trip downstairs."

Having the house stocked with everything from a pack n play to kids dishes made bringing the kids even easier. We didn’t bring our stroller because we didn’t think we’d need it, but the house had one for us and it came in handy. Libbie thought of everything you would need."

Writing this review is just a humble, hopeful husband, friend and in-law who did nothing but book a pleasant-view place that might contain such capacity, and such a place that when said women returned they would be refreshed and deeply inspired by the feminine bonds that came with it……and so it was with Libbie’s place. Having done almost nothing myself, I would still like to thank Libbie for enhancing my marriage, and those of whom I love."

It was cozy, with comfortable seating in the living room and nice beds, and plenty of clean towels to last us the whole week. We made meals at the house every night and the kitchen had all the tools we needed, with a Meijer and other grocery options just a short drive away. We also loved the outdoor space--perfect for dining al fresco and enjoying summer nights. The location is terrific--a short walk into downtown Ludington and a 10-15 minute walk (or even shorter bike ride with one of the bikes Libbie makes available) from a beautiful beach at Stearns Park. It's also a great jumping off point to visit some beautiful nearby spots (Ludington State Park, etc.) or enjoy summertime activities like blueberry picking. The house had a fully stocked chest of board games and shelves full of great books, so there was never a shortage of things to do. We couldn't have had a better time!"

She thought of everything! From the gift basked to the bottles of water and the candy dish, to the quality towels and bedding and perfect private patio, we were very comfortable. I loved being able to walk into the home and not rush out to buy hand soap, trash bags or paper towels, as can often be the case with a vacation rental. The location was ideal, and was a quick walk to the beach, marina and town. I cannot say enough good things about Libbie's house. I highly recommend this rental."

We were only a few blocks from the center of Ludington and a quick 10-12 min walk from Ludington’s beach. We found a pickleball court just north west of the house where we went to play each day.
The house had all the essentials needed for a quiet relaxing weekend. Beyond the beautiful deco, Libbie thought of the most detailed thoughtful touches such as fresh flowers, real plants, and snacks for us. There was even a book on fun facts about Michigan which we got out and read from each night to learn new things about our state we never knew! Last but not least the beds were so comfortable, which is most important in our book to get a good nights rest after a fun filled day at the beach!"

Group trip",Adorable house! It had very nice decor. It was so clean and neat and comfortable. A very nice welcome basket was provided! That was a nice touch. An older home that was remodeled beautifully! I had a question and received a very quick reply. I would definitely recommend!!

Group trip","Lyana provided excellent information and was proactive in her communications leading up to the visit. Policies and check-out instructions were easy to find and clear. The house could not have been better - it had a great aesthetic, was comfortable, was well-appointed with all we needed, and was a short walking distance away from downtown Ludington and the Lake. Our stay could not have been better."

Group trip","Our stay at the William House was wonderful! The house is beautiful and Lyana truly thought of everything someone would need during a vacation stay. The location is excellent, only a ten minute walk to town, and even less to the beach. Lyana was responsive and easy to work with (we had an issue with the booking process through a-bnb). Our group of eight adults enjoyed our stay, and plan to return for our winter get-away next year!"

We were able to walk to the beach and restaurants and it truly felt like a home away from home. There were thoughtful little touches throughout the house. I would highly recommend staying here."

Group trip",Beautiful place with a very well stocked kitchen! We were celebrating a 50th anniversary and wanted to make a cake but no mixer available. Host brought us a brand new mixer in the box within 24 hours. Upstairs was a bit difficult to keep cool. Needed to close the downstairs vents at night and there were fans in each room which helped tremendously. Everything was super clean and lovely. The outdoor space was amazing! Sat by the fire each night and made s’mores with items at the house provided by the host! Appreciated the beach towels and games that were in the house as well. Only snag was a mix up with two entrance codes given at check in. Made it a little stressful when the code wouldn’t work after a late dinner one evening. We found an unlocked window and were able to get in quickly so a potentially lengthy wait was avoided. Overall a wonderfully space!

Group trip","Great place to stay. Everything was just as it is listed. Pictures are exactly what you get. House is well stocked with all the amenities. We didn't need to buy anything except for the food. Kitchen is well stocked with all the dishes and utensils, dish soap, sponge, dishwasher soap and towels. Laundry room has soap for anything you need to wash during your stay. Well stocked with toilet paper and plenty of towels for everyone!
Due to weather, we did not get to take advantage of the outdoor games, gas grill or fire pit - but next time!!
Very quick response time - under an hour every time.
Very accommodating - we arrived about 30 minutes prior to check in and Layna allowed us in a little bit early.
Beautiful place and very comfortable. Fireplace was a pleasure on the cooler rainy days we had.
Close to everything. We walked every day to the House of Flavors for ice cream. Close to downtown and the beach. Quiet neighborhood.
Definitely recommend and will stay here again!"

Group trip","Amazingly clean and comforting place for my family to be in together during a difficult time as we were in town for the funeral of our mother. We were able to all fit and sleep very comfortably in this beautiful, clean home. Soft linens and extra touches in the 3 full baths were perfect and so appreciated as we prepared for the funeral of our Mother, grandmother. I would love to return and stay again in the summer for a happy gathering. I fell in love with the charm and space this place provides. I hope guest respect the thought and effort placed into decorating, cleaning and making you feel at home and do not rent this for a party house. This is not the home or vibe for renters looking for a rental for parties or place to sleep a variety of unrelated people. The quiet street and neighborhood must be respected."
