Stayed a few nights","Jessica's ""Blue Tub"" home was a wonderful stay for my wife and I during our visit to Fargo. The check in was seamless and the home was clean with lots of fun little extras. We are very fortunate to have such a great location to stay in Fargo and would gladly recommend this Airbnb to others."

Stayed a few nights",Loved staying here on a trip to Fargo for a Bison football game. The house was clean and the neighborhood was quiet - despite being close to campus and following a big win from the football team. Jessica left a full assortment of amenities (which came in handy for my severe last minute underpacking). We can’t wait to stay again!

Noah did acknowledge my concern and compensated some, but it just did not fit my needs."

There were lots of really thoughtful touches, like pre-filled ice cube trays and extra blankets. The space was clean and charming, and the bed was comfortable. Noah was very responsive and a great host! It was also close to downtown, which was very nice.
There were limited parking spots one night, but we were able to find one. The other days, parking was no issue at all. We could occasionally hear neighbors (especially those upstairs at night, as well as some outside the window during the day), but that wasn’t a big deal.
Overall a great stay, thank you Noah!"

Only complaint was that there was no air conditioning installed and it was pretty hot. I think that could have been checked before, but the host responded promptly to fix the issue, however I will admit it was inconvenient for maintenance to come in and install it. I would recommend this place for the value, price and comfort."

Felt like coming home and didn’t want to leave
Definitely is better than a hotel as it’s more comfortable and cozy and warm compared to the commercial feel of renting a hotel room
Would definitely do that again
So reasonable
I love the decor
Parking was a slight issue but the cute cozy home vibe made it so worth it
Thank you for a great experience
I don’t want to rent a hotel again since I experienced the coziness of this !!
Thank you again"

Stayed a few nights","The whole building runs on one heating unit in the basement of the building for all 4(?) units… if one apartment chooses HOT youre HOT and nice versa with not enough heat… however… no matter how hot the rest of the apartment would get, the back bedroom kicked our cold air all day… our first 2 days there was -35 with windchill outside, so the first night we couldn’t sleep in back bedroom and then the 2nd night we did but froze with temps in the 30’s to 40’s in back bedroom…
The door to enter the apartment from the back parking lot does not latch properly and other times jams… we left for work one day, shut door, turned key to lock and then twisted and pulled on handle to make sure shut, we then came home that night to the back door hanging wide open(-35 outside) so all of our belongings were wide open for anyone to come in and take and COLD air came in all day… the house had charm and Noah did respond but always with a “thanks we will look into it” rather than a solution"

Stayed one night","I’m going to start by saying we ended up having a good stay. The situation/price could have been better. You can hear people talking through the walls in adjoining apartments. Outside our bedroom window we heard loud talking in Spanish until a little after midnight and obviously noise that was coming from something being moved around on metal…At one point, I opened the curtain and was very surprised to see two guys sitting in the back of a pickup less than 2 feet from bedroom window and one of them looking directly at me. This was about a half hour before they finally went inside. It didn’t seem to bother them at all that they were obviously keeping us up. This isn’t Noah’s fault, but it was a bit creepy. The other thing is that the total cost was I think slightly over $150, which would have given me a very nice hotel chain type room that’s up to date instead of a dated house that I could hear everyone around me through the walls. By the time you get service fees, cleaning fees, Air bnb fees, etc, the price exceeds the value at $150+
The pros? Noah is very responsive and great at communicating to let you know where the place is and how to get in, where to park. The place was clean, and did not smell. You had everything you need and a full size fridge and bathroom supplies. Noah doesn’t control how much Air bnb takes and he has to make a living as well. Location was good and parking was convenient."

Cons:

-pictures of space were misleading (cleanliness, quality)
-minor amenities not accurate
There were some significant cleanliness issues we didn’t see until the morning. Noah was quick to respond and offer solutions. However, with our time frame we didn’t want to wait around for the cleaning people and decided it was better for us to check out a day early."

Stayed with kids","Cons first: one bedroom doesn't buffer traffic noises well, the AC turns on quite loud, some minor cleanliness issues like stains on couches, dust, mold stains, peeling paint, and appliances having bits of food residue.
That being said we would happily stay there again since the Pros outweighed the Cons. This is a lovely small home with tons of natural sunlight. Pull down blinds still give the option for total privacy. The fenced-in yard was perfumed with their blossoming trees and had a fire pit and lighted outdoor dining area. The arcade machine with over 1000 games was a huge hit with our young son. Though small the interior is styled very well with many separate places to spend time either alone or as a family. A game cupboard was stocked with several puzzles and card games. We all had a great night's sleep in the comfy bed! 9.5/10 overall"

We look forward to staying here again, and again, and again ￼!"

Our kids loved the arcade games and it was nice to be able to access our streaming service as well. We also appreciated the recommendation to KidsCo! We went there and it was a great experience! We have stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this was by far my best experience!"

THIS - An unprecedented positive & hospitality-supported check-in experience at AirBNB so I am revelling in it because it meant that much to me at the time which was the midnight hour.

She was very responsive and checked in on our arrival time the day before to make sure the house was ready for us.
Thanks Very Much Reina."

Reina was responsive and kind— she even had the carpets deep cleaned right before we got there because I was worried about my son’s allergies. We also appreciated being able to park our car in the garage. We really were only there overnight and left early the next morning, but I would stay there again—-"

Stayed with kids","This is a great place and a great value for a small extended family stay. We stayed for one night, so we didn't really use the kitchen much, but everything was clean, comfortable, and easy to use. It was a very nice perk that there were no complicated checkout instructions to read or follow - just lock the door and check out!
There were a couple minor things we were wishing for (sweetener for the coffee, or a deck of cards to play a game), but overall we were grateful for all that was provided! Now, the oven did start the bottom of our take-and-bake pizza on fire somehow... we've never had that happen before, but it was an adventure - worked out okay. Not sure if it was the oven, or if we somehow did something wrong - just bake carefully!
Reina was very responsive, and accommodating - thank you! :)"

The only negative thing I would have to say is that the security camera that is stated “at entrance” is actually inside of the home by the entrance doors.
We did contact our host about this and she was very responsive in explaining that it’s for security purposes of people entering in the home but it did make us feel slightly uncomfortable that it was physically inside of the house. Other than that, the house/ stay was great for my family and I."

We loved utilizing the garage for older kids with the games, and there were plenty of toys appropriate for all ages- and we had them newborn- to 18, even the adults were taking part in basketball challenges! Everything was clean, well maintained, and thoughtfully decorated. We would definitely book it again if the opportunity arises! Thank you for your speedy response time to all our questions- and providing a beautiful space for our families to make memories!"

Group trip","Patrick is the most thoughtful, gracious host! And we are very happy his property Ultimate Gathering Pad. Massive 8 bdrm, 6 bath! was available for a whole week, which is a rare luck!
Our team of 15 yo boys, ice-hockey players, who came to Fargo for 4 weeks to practice their skills at the camp, had a fantastic time at Patrick's house! It is very convenient and comfortable, boys spent time in one half of the house and adults could enjoy some peace and rest in the other. The kitchen is very well equipped and stocked and had everything for daily cooking for 12-14 people - it was very important for us. We hope our next time trip to Fargo won't be in the same dates with Wrestling tournament and we'll be able to reserve Patrick's house for the whole period of our stay. Thank you!
P.S. Playstation was a great idea, so we had to buy one when we moved to a different property ))"

Great hot water situation throughout the property.
Love the coffee and tea selections!
Love their inspirational wall decor. Thermostat was locked for temp adjustment. Maybe request for host to unlock while guests are there?
Overall both sides were very nice. Loved the deck and sitting outside Sunday morning for a bit. The ramps on both sides are helpful for post-marathon runners. Great location - everything was a short drive from the house. Neighborhood was nice and quiet as well."

The kitchen is nicely stocked with coffee, tea, stevia and quick breakfast items as well as many small appliances. Comfy beds.

Location is STUNNING, easy to access and right down town! Tons of restaurants and shops within walking distance.
Photos of location are accurate to real life and look exactly as pictured! The kitchen is VERY well stocked and has everything you may need.
Additionally, they included special touches such as ear plugs next to the bed, all the cleaning product you may need, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash. All of which were greatly appreciated!
***One thing I do wanna note to future guests, which has nothing to do with the wonderful hosts… being this location is RIGHT downtown - know ahead of time that it will be very loud and noisy outside until the wee hours of the morning. Especially on Saturday evening.
I highly recommend this unit and the hosts!

Downtown Fargo has amazing shops and restaurants, all a short walk away.
Beyond Running/Outer Most Layer was a great find for shopping and my meal at Pounds was delicious!
Thank you the Paige for all the wonderfully helpful proactive communication. I will definitely stay again when I am back through Fargo!"

Stayed one night","Paige’s unit was a perfect spot for our too-brief intro to Fargo. Comfortable, elegant, and functional, and literally in the center of historic downtown. Our only note for potential visitors (not really a complaint, since it’s the nature of the beast) is that Main Street is just outside the window, which can be a little noisy on busy evenings. This being the case, Paige helpfully provides earplugs in the bedroom :) Thanks again, Paige et al!"

The place itself is cozy but clean and nice and has just enough funky to be fun. Again, the windows are right out to Broadway so they are great for people watching with your morning coffee or a nightcap.
Self check-in had perfect instructions and the guidebook had QR codes for menus. We just Ubered in and we’re able to walk to everything. The price is perfectly reasonable. It was perfect for the trip we had planned."

Nothing within the host's control, but be aware there were several homeless people and many of them approached us or made comments as we passed.

The space is really beautiful - high ceilings, original wood, minimal aesthetic, Broadway view, plus lamps and string lights for dim lighting options.
Broadway can be loud late into the night which is certainly a consideration - I didn’t mind the noise personally, but know it could be a factor for some.
Overall - highly recommend for 1-2 people looking a nice spot in the city center."

General thought (not specific to this host) - it would be nice if the listed price included cleaning fees. It’s misleading to start with a quoted price of $150 only to have another $50+ added on for cleaning. Hotels, etc don’t do this."

Stayed with kids","The location of this unit couldn't get any better, you're within walking distance of everything you would need for the day, plenty of coffee shops for the morning, restaurants ranging from cheap dining to gourmet for lunch and dinner, there is a lovely ice cream parlor for desert, and a variety of bars and pubs for the nightlife.
Now about the unit itself, It was very clean, and very organized, not too many loose items which was great because my wife and I brought our daughter with and there wasn't a a bunch of loose items for her to get into. The area is more spacious than the pictures give credit, and everything was very easy to locate
There were a few small items that I think are fair to point out. Firstly parking can get a little challenging at peak hours of the day, secondly my wife and I weren't huge fans of the smell of the air freshener in the main stairwell, and thirdly the hot water takes a fair amount of time to heat up.
All that aside 10/10 would recommend."

Found parking easily on the south side of the building. Pay clear attention to the signs and no problem. Parking ramps nearby as well. Found the lock box easily thanks to the clear instructions and the help of Sammy's Pizza (we were hungry) and made our way inside.
Yes, there are stairs, it's on the second floor. No problem. They're carpeted and safe and led us right to the door. Entered easily with the help of the keypad and clear directions and made our way inside.
Inside was comfy for our arrival, but we warmed it up a little more. Not a chill in the air.
Yes, there is some street noise. It's downtown, not the plains - that's why we chose it.
Beautiful decor and touches. Extraordinarily clean. Comfortable bed and loved the chair.
We enjoyed the time we spent would love to have stayed an extra week to work had it not been the New Year holiday.
Will definitely be back."

Stayed one night","Great place for a short stay in Fargo. It's a cute apartment and the bed is comfortable! Lots of good food options in walking distance! We were there on a Saturday night so parking was more difficult than expected. There's a list of parking garage options in a booklet in be apartment, but it would be helpful to research this prior to arrival so you're better prepared on a weekend. We spent several minutes driving around the snow-covered block trying to find a place to unload the car; my husband ended up having to stay on the car with flashers in the street while I ran in and out to bring in our belongings. Pack light because there are stairs to climb to reach the apartment. This is shown in the listing pictures as well.
The windows are very thin so you can hear every conversation on the street outside. For it being a Saturday night, we could hear yelling and talking on the street until about 1:30am. The host provided disposable ear plugs, which was a nice touch."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay here! So comfy, cozy, and vibey. The location can’t be beat. It’s literally in the heart of downtown! The only reason we didn’t give it 5 stars is because the listing said “free parking on premises”. It’s actually free street parking (90 minutes outside the Bnb). It was unexpected having to pay to use the ramp when we couldn’t find parking. We’d still stay again, though, because it’s that charming!"

Stayed about a week","Sophia was a wonderful hostess! The space she provided for my business trip was quiet at night, cozy for a rainier season than I am used to and it has plenty of couch space. The kitchen and single bathroom are exactly as advertised - clean, newer and inviting.
The added bonus for me was that the washer and dryer were as private as the bathroom was!
The price is modest if you’re spending a week or more and the location is off of a one way (Southbound) street and if you blink at the corner, you may miss this gem of a BnB the first time around.
Please note that the ceiling is under 6 1/2 feet in the main living room. Be mindful of that, taller travelers! It’s a finished and furnished basement dwelling, but you couldn’t ask for a nicer space while on the road for business.”"

Your feet turned black from walking on the dirty-floors,cob webs were hanging on light fixtures,dirty and torn up carpets,fingerprints all over tv and refrigerator, a kitchen drawer face is broken, no ice maker, oven so filthy I wouldn’t even think about cooking in it, the beds were hard as a rock,along with the upstairs one leaning towards your head and to the side, there was a sign in the front yard saying pesticides sprayed I did not let my dogs hang outside (they did not want to anyway cause the neighbour’s deck overlooks your yard and they were skittish about it) the short time they were one of my dogs had allergic reaction and needed vet treatment. There were holes in the fence and one fence panel is falling in, the Neighbor was making noise and carrying on most all of Saturday night. I do not recommend"

Great playroom with games and toys upstairs (steep staircase so May want to consider a baby gate if needed for littles). Close to the freeway but really no indoor freeway noise. We loved the backyard and appreciated all the Adirondack chairs while our little ones played outside. Kitchen well stocked with basics. All in all would love to stay here again."

Originally the listing was for 6 and we had 7, and she said that was fine. Then we had 8 and they had been working on another room and we were able to have 8 of us stay. I was amazed at the space and how well it worked for our party of 8 adults. There was a simple beauty about the furnishings, colors and decor. Very pleasant.
The firepit area was so inviting, but it was so hot this particular weekend, so that just wasn't going to happen. The basketball/hoop provided some great fun for our young adult kids.
We were also only 6 minutes from where Fargo Baptist Church/Master's Baptist College, which is where we were attending a wedding. So, for anyone needing a place to stay while visiting this church/college, this was so convenient."

The place also had a few small touches/amenities that I was not expecting. For instance, a few packages of ground coffee, a variety or sugar brands and sugar replacements, tea and spoons. There were also a few snacks out as a little welcome gift -- individual packets of oreos, popcorn, cheese its, etc.
Overall, a great place to stay for a great price. Ashley and the host were quick to respond and address any comments/questions/concerns. Checking in and out was a breeze. I would recommend staying here and would surely stay again the next time I find myself in Fargo!"

Enjoyed the little treats and especially the water!
It has been mentioned by others and I agree that the sofa bed is not comfortable for an adult. Even with extra padding available it does noes not provide a good night's sleep.
The bed is comfortable though. If the comforter's are the same come winter time, you will be nice and toasty!"

Private and nearly frictionless experience! The weather kept us from using the patio but it looked great and the extra snacks and amenities were above and beyond thoughtful. We will look for this listing again in the future!

A little small for more than 2 people but would be an excellent place to stay for a couple, or couple with a child under 5! Very clean and very easy to get to! Would definitely stay again if I’m in the area for a few days!"

Stayed a few nights","We were disappointed, we did not have access to the Wi-Fi code and there was no response to our email or calls. The tv remote had 2 remotes glued together (one for antenna (we assumed) and one for tv), no instructions as to how to use it, the next day we finally figured it out after much frustration. The patio had been pressure washed and tree seeds were stuck all over the fence, patio furniture and covered the outdoor carpeting which tracked in terrible (seeds had stopped falling days prior). There was no handrail for the uneven, carpeted stairs that led up to the bathroom. Turning down the bed linens in the evening there were blood stains on one pillowcase top and fitted sheets. (I left a suggestion on how they might get the 'set-in' stains out.) During the day and evening we could hear children and adult conversation coming from the next room. Other than that, it was cute, but will not stay there again."

Stayed one night",Ashley’s place is very cute and clean. But I had to leave because there was too much noise on the other side of the wall. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep and it didn’t feel private. Ashley did refund me willingly.

Stayed one night","Ashley put a lot of very thoughtful touches to make our stay more enjoyable. She did not have to! She had snacks, extra toothbrush, toothpaste, pop, etc. The instructions were very clear and communication was very quick! Would highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids",We arrived to Ashley’s place with detailed instruction for check in. It made it a breeze. The inside was wonderful! It’s everything a family of 4 could need. The air conditioner was a nice touch since it was very humid outside. We ate our dinner on the beautiful patio. The shower was great too. Ashley has the pack n play all set up for us upon arrival which was helpful after a full day of driving. There is a park nearby which was also nice for the kids to play at and blow of some steam. Thanks again for the stay and would recommend to anyone Visiting Fargo.

Stayed one night","AirBnb goals! My husband and I stayed here after a long day of driving and had a great visit. Street parking was easy and free. The entrance was well lit when we arrived at night. The space is very stylish and perfectly clean. It was convenient to do laundry here and Ashley was super quick to respond when we couldn't figure out how to start the washer. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the shower felt like a spa! The chocolates and snacks were a nice touch, too! The neighborhood was safe for a morning run and it was easy to not get lost. Downtown Fargo had lots of ammenities and the Walmart and Target were very nice. If you're passing through North Dakota, do yourself a favor and book this spot!"
