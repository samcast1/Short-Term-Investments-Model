Stayed a few nights","Stephanie's apartment is 100% as described, spacious, clean, nicely decorated and ideally located. The neighborhood is in the most beautiful part of Downton Little Rock, and restaurants and bars are within walking distance. Stephanie and Madison are helpful, courteous and flexible. So it was possible for me to check in earlier and the bikes provided for free are great for exploring Little Rock.
An unrestricted recommendation!"

Stayed one night",I stayed at Stephanie's for only a night and that's probably the only sad part about my stay. My first thought when I checked in and dropped my bags off was that this was one of the best places I've stayed at using this platform. My room came with its own little kitchen and bathroom and both were extremely clean and pleasing to use. Things were extremely clean and the room even had a ton of pamphlets with local recommendations. I will use this place again if I ever find myself in Little Rock.

Stayed a few nights","Accommodations were perfect for our weekend here with a kitchen that had all the tools we needed, super easy street parking in front of the home, walking distance from multiple great restaurants in a hip up and coming area. There were other guests staying here when we were and the A/C unit was a great sound machine, so we couldn’t hear them. The apartment had awesome blackout curtains in the bedroom area that really helped keep the morning light out & the mattress was extremely comfortable! Loved being able to stay in a historic home and the vintage furniture was a great touch. We had a wonderful stay here and would love to come back if we are in the area."

The space was very nice and clean, definitely as others have mentioned be aware before booking that the walls are pretty thin so quiet guests would probably be most favorable. The hosts were very quick to respond to questions I had which I appreciated!"

Stayed with a pet",Was passing through on a road trip with my dog and had never stayed in Arkansas before. I was pleasantly surprised with the welcoming energy and surrounding neighborhood at Stephanie’s! You can tell she put a lot of thought into the space. It doesn’t feel like a random bleek home that is only used for rentals. Privacy was not an issue and the check in was a breeze. I even asked to stay 30 minutes longer because I was enjoying myself so much and didn’t want to hop back on the road….i would love to return in the future!

I got there very early and she had recommendations of where I could go with my dog while I waited for the apartment to be cleaned. The apartment (#3) was very lovely and cozy. We really liked the layout. This apartment is within walking distance (2-3 blocks) of the main street with all the restaurants and the distillery. The neighborhood felt very safe and the local residents were very friendly. I am looking forward to staying there again.

The place was perfect, I could stay longer there. I was there for 3 nights and I felt very good. The place was very welcoming, all clean and comfortable. The bed was perfect to rest and you have all you need in the kitchen.
A supermarket is close even walking and there are many places a short distance, so you feel like at home. I knew that there were other apartments in the same home but I we never see each other I felt a good privacy.
Excellent communication with Stephanie.
Thank you !"

Stayed about a week","I came back because the stay was fantastic! I and my daughter enjoyed it for many days. I'm a stickler for quietness and peace. I had an amazing Stay! I will recommend to anyone traveling here to Little Rock. They generally give you everything you may need and better than a hotel. Yasssss!! This place will not disappoint you if your seeking. The skyline out the windows is my favorite because I love trees and loved 👀 seeing the Monarch land on the window as I cooked. Being able to cook, and have essentials like pots, pans, access to a refrigerator, most of all a coffee pot makes all the difference in the world for awaking early morning. Being able to open the kitchen window in Apt #4, was truly unique. I love hearing outside noise and it was my highlight. I'll book it any day over a hotel if your a more reserved person. I am!
Best,
Kanisha"

Stayed with kids","I enjoyed it so much, I felt like I was visiting a family member's home. Private, Peaceful and very chill. I and my daughter both familiar with the neighborhood because I once lived at 1400 Cumberland location over a year ago for 5 years, so I wanted to stay close to SOMA which is why I wanted a downtown location to relax in before I move back downtown area permanently again soon. Stephanie and Jason's place gave me those memories of living back downtown again. I grew up on Rock street 1 street over and have lived in downtown most of my entire life, and I felt right at home at this residence. I miss it so much being close to nearby restaurants, convenient grocery stores, and the entertainment district especially the Bernice Gardens, and my favorite Pizzeria Rad Uno. Thank you all for the experience and I look forward to lodging again. Never a dull moment living in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas.
Best,
Kanisha and Scarlet"

She responded right away whenever we asked a question and was always very accommodating. There was construction going on which was actually helpful for us so we can wake up and explore early! Haha!

While all that was great, there was some pretty intensive construction going on at the house at the time which woke me up pretty early each morning. Moreover, I couldn't get to the laundry without stepping on discarded roof tiles littered with bent nails, which was not a pleasant experience."

Because I’m taking a long trip, I have a cool chest and food along with me in addition to my suitcase and my dog. This was a lot of carrying up and down the stairs for me. Being an older person, that made it harder. Perhaps they could mention that. I can see that they’re renovating the house, so there is a lot of construction material in the hallways, and in the apartment."

Stayed with a pet","This was a great find for a last minute stop to break up a longer drive. We didn't get to experience it as part of a longer trip to Little Rock, but with the detail and level of information provided by Stephanie as well as the location, I imagine a longer stay would have been great. Especially love how pet friendly it was-it's not always easy for us to find a place that will allow all 3 of our dogs. Also really appreciated the thoughtfulness: having a white noise machine? Genius."

Stayed with a pet","This is a great little place for one or two people. You’ll actually be surprised how big it is inside. The kitchen is quite spacious with a long hallway, leading to the bed. The bathroom is small but that’s to be expected from an old building. It’s really close to restaurants and cafés. You must go to the Root cafe for breakfast. There are also some bars just down the street. The people in the area seem to be friendly. I actually got into a two hour conversation with a couple on the street while walking my dog. I would definitely stay here again so I could explore the city more."

Stayed one night","A very quiet, safe and walkable place to stay, but know it is not the most updated home. However, it has what you need for a clean and cozy stay - plenty of fresh towels, good water pressure in shower, comfortable bed, cooking amenities, shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion, tissues, etc. It's a great place to stay for a few nights for one or 2 people as it is a tight space. As mentioned, it is an older home so quiet guests are best as you don't want to be hearing other conversations, music, etc. from the other rooms. I will say the wifi didn't work great for the smart TV at night but that isn't a big deal if you don't plan to stay in the apartment most days. No drinking water provided, but luckily I had brought my own. There was also no dish soap to wash the few dirty dishes I had (hope that wasn't a pain on my hosts!). I really liked the place overall and felt right at home. I would stay here again for sure!"

Stayed one night","This is a scam. I mean you will get the Airbnb in the pictures but it is nothing like you think it would be. It’s not as nice as it shows. Pictures can change a lot. Also, she has a scam going where she has a sheet in her drawer and there’s a sign on it that says if pets are going to stay on the bed put the sheet on the bed. My dog didn’t even sleep on the bed but I wanted to put the sheet up anyway in case he jumped up there and I actually stayed after my dog and my fiancé left the next day and slept for a little while longer and then I get a text from her later that evening saying did you know there was urine all over the bed and trying to get me to pay more money. I check every Airbnb before I leave and that definitely was not something that happened however she does make you leave the door open before you leave which is so weird. So yeah it’s tiny it’s cramped it’s kind of a crap hole I wouldn’t stay there. The only thing is if you’re on a budget and you really need a bed then yeah it’s fine but I would not bring a dog do not put the sheet on the bed. Oh yeah by the way it was open when I got there I thought there was a burglar. But I guess that’s just part of her extra money scam"

Neighborhood was great; a nice walk along tree-lined streets to the great restaurants and shops in the SOMA district, and just over the footbridge over the interstate to the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts in MacArthur Park. At no time did we hear any traffic noise from the interstate. We had a great stay and plan to return. Thank you!"

Stayed with a pet","This tiny house was the perfect size for my husband, myself & two pups! Dero was super speedy with his messages and although we didn’t need anything extra from him, I know he would’ve gone out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect!
For anyone who will be bringing dogs - The yard was a good size and being an owner of smaller dogs I’m always extra careful when it comes to making sure there’s no gaps around the fence! Deros lot was perfect - he also provided a couple dog treats & bowls!
We walked to a couple close places and felt comfortable - I’m not going to lie, the area has a couple rough spots but that comes with any city, there were a couple homeless people a couple blocks away but they were friendly and didn’t harass us walking around. You can tell they are doing lots of remodels on many of the lots in the area, there are some really beautiful modern houses including Deros!
We highly recommend

Lost 40 brewery
Root cafe
Nexus coffee

Stayed with a pet","This was a perfect place to stay for a single person or couple- lots of restaurants nearby as well as a lovely dog park. The outdoor area was such a nice tough being fully fenced in and having seating as well as a picnic table to make eating pleasant since the inside is more setup like a modern hotel room. Everything is exactly as described and Dero was responsive and helpful. They even had dog bowls and dog treats ready- my little dog had a great time in the yard as well as the nearby dog park. The bed was extremely comfortable and the tv was easy to use with access to streaming services. They even had some provided bottled waters and coffee pods- I cannot imagine a more perfect place to stay for short trips. I wish we had more time to explore the area, this was a stop in the middle of an out of state move so we were only there briefly but I confidently recommend this for anyone needing a short but very comfortable stay in the area."

It’s like having a hotel room except you have a fenced in yard and premium parking, and no elevators! Dero left the place welcoming including dog treats and filled water bowls for my pets. Room and yard were very clean, which is appreciated for a pet friendly place, which is usually not the case for hotel rooms. There was an issue with someone parked in the designated spot when I arrived but Dero was quick to respond and resolved it in person right away. Will try to stay here again for my next trip!"

I love the fact that there were dog bowls already there - and even some dog treats left by the house, which was a nice touch! The property is lit up very well what you made me feel safe as a solo traveler. I wish it was warmer, so I could use the space outside but it was a perfect outside area for my dog. it is a semi shared driveway, which was no big deal, but completely separate from the main house, which was perfect and private. I loved the fact the host had the separate fenced in space for just this house. The bed was comfortable and everything was super clean! I will definitely be staying back here when I come back through in a few months. The location is right because it is right off the interstate but we did not hear any type of noise."

The Layover was exactly what we needed for a restorative stop on our road trip with our dogs. So nice to let the dogs be off-leash in a totally secure yard. The queen size bed was very comfortable with nice bedding; great that there is a mini-fridge, dishes, microwave, and coffee; lovely window treatments that kept out the light in the morning; and a desk to get some work done. Perfect. Really."

The place was easy to find, super comfortable and within distance to a number of places. We went to SoMa for dinner and had the best time at Raduno! Don’t miss the Loblolly ice cream shop for those with a sweet tooth! If it weren’t so hot and humid we would have loved to sit and enjoy the fire pit. Dero was also very accommodating. Little Rock is currently undergoing what seems a major transformation, so don’t let the construction and projects deter you, this is a little gem of a place."

Dero's Layover is clean, comfortable, and located in a very cool part of Little Rock. Literally blocks from great dining, a dog park, and all that the SoMa neighborhood offers. It's just an unbeatable stay for the price, and the neighbors are chill and friendly. We LOVE the fenced yard for relaxing after a long day's drive. Sharing a Raduno's pepperoni at the picnic table is the perfect ""date night"" on the road! We are looking forward to visit number six and beyond!"

There were condiments in the fridge, a small bowl of welcome snacks, to-go cups for morning coffee, single-use eye masks/ear plugs, robes in the closet, the electrical sockets next to the bed had usb, etc. The decor was coherent and i really liked the styling. The proportions of the house were also great considering its a tiny home: spacious walk-in shower with double vanity in the bathroom, good-size comfy bed, and some space to eat/lounge. Hosts were very responsive and there wasnt a massive list of check-out responsibilities (hate when theres a whole to-do list for check-out). Absolutely worth the price! Would stay again!"

Loved the house and all the little touches (front door and gorgeous little porch). Beautiful restoration of a historic home that needed much attention. Plenty of plugs and choice of lighting. The king bed slept wonderfully and the bathroom had plenty of space. A big plus was there was plenty of parking behind the nest. There is lots of exterior lights at night (we were not use to) but it was nice when coming in at night or after dinner. But there is darkening curtains throughout. When we come back to Little Rock we definitely would stay in the Nest."

She was very professional & proactive. She always had a solution to any problem & was also very quick to respond!
From a very lovely welcome to an inviting fair well, I enjoyed Ms. Angela’s listing to the fullest & I’d definitely stay with her again as I felt it was such a privilege to do so this time.
I 100% recommend this stay, but only to guest who have the upmost respect for other people’s spaces as I believe Ms. Angela more than deserves it!"

Every aspect of this stay was 5 stars 🌟 Angela was quick to respond to all of our needs, including questions prior to booking regarding property & dining recommendations as we were a late arrival. The Hummingbird cottage has been totally renovated with high end boutique vibes while still embracing its historical elements. It’s obvious that every single detail has been well planned with the intentions that you feel relaxed & pampered during your stay. We had a good nights rest on the well dressed king bed & the blackout curtains made it easy to sleep in a little later than normal. Even though we were only there one night, I could easily see us staying longer. There was ample storage/ drawers to totally unpack & even robes to snuggle up in. Another plus was the dedicated parking spot at the cottage.
Don’t miss an opportunity to stay at the Hummingbird cottage, it’s a must book location 😊"

Stayed one night","Cute and clean. We felt mostly comfortable but we were not told that two panes of glass in the living room window were broken, or that one of the living room windows would not lock. One pane had a 11”x 5” hole that I could stick my hand outside and air moved freely from outside to inside. The other pane had a plastic grocery bag barely taped over it, with five small pieces of painters tape. Both broken panes were located next to the window lock, but the window is unable to be locked in the first place.
None of this was communicated prior and when I emailed them to let them know, this was their response.
“Hi yes- we know about that- our handyman is in process of fixing it. Thanks!”
Everything was great but being in a location where the homeless are present, an unlockable window and broken window glass should be addressed before guests stay."

Stayed a few nights","This home in North Little Rock was exactly as described. For our family of 4 adults, it was perfect with ample space to spread out a bit. Loved that there was no clutter, and everything was just as described. As shown in the pictures, the one bathroom is small, but honestly, it works. And the more important thing was that there were plenty of linens and towels provided which was very nice. And things just smelled ""clean"". Kudos to whoever makes the beds as the clean crisp sheets were tucked in at the corners just the way I like them! You can't beat the location either if you are in town for an event in NLR or in surrounding suburbs as this home gives you very easy access to the highway without being right on the highway. The neighborhood was quiet. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to use the backyard but it's a nice big backyard so you could go out back and throw a football around. Thanks to our host who accommodated the one request that I had."

Stayed a few nights","Peaceful and quiet space. Owners left detailed notes as well as clean up instructions. Place could use some upkeep in relation to cleaning.
While the obvious was done across the board, it isn’t fun sitting in a tiny bathroom looking at dirty spots all over the wall and a dirty window seal.
The instructions were perfect and easy to follow. I’m glad my other two guests did not make the trip or it would have been rough with a bathroom so small.
I felt like I was in a super 8 when in the bathroom. Also, many of the floors have slopes that make you feel like you’re going to trip.
The kitchen had items that were helpful, especially since I forgot my seasonings.
The highlight of my stay was the peace and quiet. The lowlight is the blinds in the room that shares a window with the neighbors car. Especially when sleeping. Maybe curtains would be better than blinds."

Stayed with a pet","The Ivy Cottage was adorable. After a long drive it was the perfect place to spend the night with my girlfriend and two pups. The space was very clean and well appointed. We arrived late and didn’t get to spend much time at the house before heading out for the second half of our drive to Austin TX. We were still able to appreciate the space and Christina’s extra special touches. Ex. Snacks on the counter, special makeup washcloths and a fenced in backyard.
I will be back again for sure. Thank you for sharing your home."

Stayed a few nights","While the Ivy Cottage is well designed and communication with host is lightning fast and much appreciated, the neighborhood is quite unsightly and safety felt questionable to me. I was excited to have a fenced in back yard for my Boston Terrier but unfortunately could not use it due to previous irresponsible pet owners who did not pick up after their dogs. There were landminds everywhere and of course my dog ran through one. :( While it should go without saying, host might consider a sign to remind pet owners to be courteous to future guests and pick up all dog waste."

The home is inviting and welcoming. Christina had provided more than the basics which really helped our family focus on the important things.
We did also find that the wonderful space for our dogs was perfect ( she even had dog treats, dog bowl’s etc…)
During my stay I never left the house and I was able to easily care for my 2 year old grandson by having groceries and other items delivered so my son and daughter in law could easily go to and from the hospital ( 7 minutes away)
Thank you Christina and family for making our time at your place feel like our own!"

Decor: perfect. I love the green tiles, and everything from the shower water pressure to the thermostat to the bed linens was very thoughtful and well executed.
Logistics: check in and out was a breeze, and the hosts were super communicative and gave great neighborhood tips! I especially liked strolling down Main Street in the SoMa area. South on Main and the Root were my favorites! (I went to the root 3x in 2 days - great food and coffee).
Location: I rented a car and found the location ideal for everything I wanted to see and do. I walked a lot too, and found the neighborhood surprisingly walkable and very friendly.
In all, a wonderful stay and I would happily visit again. I felt very at home for my 48 hours in Little Rock!"

Pets aren’t allowed to get on the furniture and since we have a new puppy, this was a difficult rule to follow. We kept her in her kennel to ensure she didn’t get on the furniture, which was hard on us. A pre-warning about the furniture rule would have been great.
All in all, I would recommend this stay sans the furniture rule."

One thing to note is if you are staying with a dog, there are grape vines growing all over the fence in the front yard (which gives the front yard such a quaint look). Our dog isn’t too curious and didn’t get into them, however if your dog will eat anything it comes across, I would handle with care since grapes are poisonous to dogs :)"

Also, the neighborhood was run down. I did not like having to park on the street.
Now, the inside of the “tiny home” was great. Very clean, plenty of amenities.
The location of the property was perfect for everything I wanted to see in Little Rock.
Had the property looked as advertised, this place would have been fantastic. Did not appreciate the misrepresentation."

Stayed with a pet","Had a lovely one night stay at James'. It is just enough space for one or two people, plus they allow pets. The home was so clean and is well-finished.
Check in was effortless and James had left us cold waters, snacks, and ice in the freezer. We didn't cook, but the kitchen has a full-sized stove and all the things you may need to make a meal if you so choose. There is street parking right in front of the house, so it's just a short walk to the front door with your luggage.
The yard isn't overly large, but plenty of space for a dog to run around since it is fully fenced. The back has berries growing and a small garden and chickens, which is fun. No roosters, so no need to worry about crowing.
The home is a short drive to many restaurants, bars, etc. and was easy to find with GPS. We enjoyed Bruno's. Great Italian! And ice cream from Loblolly.
Would highly recommend this rental for anyone needing a smaller space that has all you need in Little Rock.
James was also quick to respond :)"

Thank you!!!"

Stayed with kids","We had an amazing time! Dana provided everything we needed. The house was decorated for Christmas, which made our Christmas even better. We only had one issue the whole time, the pilot light to heat the pool went out but Dana came out of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to make sure we were taking care of and able to enjoy the heated pool! I would highly recommend a stay at the Divine Oasis! You and your family will not be disappointed! The rooms have child locks so the kids can’t get to the pool in the middle of the night for those with small children! We absolutely loved having our Christmas there this year and hope to be back soon!"

Stayed with kids","We had our family Christmas at the devine oasis. A very unique place. The set up worked well for our family. The place was clean with many amenities, & the pool was amazing! One of the best features is that you can see the pool from any room in the home which made it easy to keep an eye on the kids. The pool area has it's own heat/air unit which allowed us to adjust to a comfortable temperature. The pool water stayed between 80-85 degrees & felt great! Everything from extra towels to crock pots were available. Plenty of toiletries & laundry pods. The host Dana was absolutely amazing! She greeted us upon arrival to give us information & instructions for the property. She was available to contact with any questions & very quick to respond. This place made one of the best and most memorable times for us! We will definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","This house is uniquely awesome & was just perfect for our group of 11!! Having an indoor pool (with a fun slide) in the middle of the house is super neat! The 3 bedrooms are spacious & comfortable, very large master suite king bed, the two bunks are twin over full which was great, and the other room has two full beds. Beds & decor very nice. Everything is fresh & new, super soft towels, convenient laundry room by the bath & bedrooms. Welcome cookies & a bottle of wine were appreciated.
While the pool being located between the bedrooms and the rest of the house (living, kitchen, & dining) worked great for us, the pool is just steps from each side of the house, so young children who don't
swim would need to be watched carefully, obviously.
Dana's place was a house
like no other & we
enjoyed ourselves very
much!!
We hope to stay again."

The master bedroom is perfect for couples and includes an in-room jacuzzi and a huge vanity area for two. There are 3.5 bathrooms with one conveniently located in the pool area. The Divine Oasis will be our go to for affordable memories with my family. Dana went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect."

Just sat on the deck and on the dock, and watched the world go by and the sun set. Barges, blue herons, Canadian geese, little fish jumping up to eat, funny sounding birds, relaxing waves hitting the side of the boat-all so enchanting.
The interior decorating was beautiful, the attention to the small details that travelers are often looking for was over the top excellent, and all of the furnishings were warm and inviting. It did not feel like a small space at all. We loved our stay."

The road leading to the marina is in a newly renovated upscale neighborhood. The Floating House is the only permanent boat there, so it was very private. The gate leading to the boat dock stays locked. An Access code is given prior to check in. The River is calm and gentle, therefore we did not feel any quesiness. This is a one of a kind, must-stay place. Trust me, you'll want to go back."

Stayed one night","The place was exactly as pictured and described. It was perfect for my wife and I. It was in a new living community. it felt as though the neighborhood was very safe. It is right next to the River Trail which runs a great distance down the side if the river. The only issue I had was the ramp down to the marina was very steep. I'm not sure if it is like this all the time or if the river was low (obviously not the hosts fault, but be prepared). Check in was a breeze. The bed was very comfortable. The barges would make a wake and it would rock ever so gently. The back porch was amazing and was absolutely great at night to relax and look at the city skyline, and for having breakfast in the morning. Only regret is not having a couple of more days to spend there."

Stayed a few nights","Two words, BOOK NOW‼️
This Airbnb rental will be my top choice for anyone traveling to the area for a solo or couple getaway. I would absolutely book Myranda’s accommodations over any hotel. The privacy & peaceful energy of the houseboat is unmatched. She did an amazing job with the beautiful aesthetics even with the limited space.
The back patio area with the astonishing view is where you will spend most mornings and nights, especially with the special touch of binoculars supplied by the host. From the exceptional communication after booking to the special snack basket you will not go wrong in booking this space.
Mark my world, this houseboat will be a top rental! I foresee many people traveling for the experience & those locally even selecting the rental for a staycation. There is nothing not to love, it’s truly a beautiful home away from home.
Thank you Myranda for the amazing experience, you are sitting on a gem!❤️"

Directions were clear and everything is well labeled. Plus, the home just felt so welcoming! Myranda had left two bottles of water, some snacks, fantastic Keurig coffee and tea, binoculars to view birds and the like on the river, and more! It just felt like Myranda goes out of her way to make guests feel luxurious and the home is just an absolute diamond in the diamond state. I cannot wait to go back!

The neighborhood is a fairly OK residential neighborhood, with no business nearby.
Houston, the dog, is affectionate and surprisingly well behaved. He did get into a bag of snacks that I carelessly left accessible on the LR floor, so watch out for that. We wouldn't want him eating any chocolate!"

Stayed one night","it's hard to say just what was the best part of our stay at Abigail's. Everything was BEYOND clean and she was very friendly and accommodating. The towels we used were fluffy and brand new, the bed was very comfortable and anything we needed or wanted was easily within reach. I'm positive that if we HAD lacked something, she would have been right there to assist. It was very quiet and we felt right at home. I would definitely, DEFINITELY stay there a second time if I find myself in Little Rock again! Thank you so much, Abigail, your home is a treasure!"

She had everything perfectly prepared for us - right down to a personalized welcome sign even though we booked it the same day! Everything was literally shining clean! Such a pleasant place with super cute decor. She made it so we had our own space but didn’t feel uncomfortable if we crossed paths with her. Very laid back and kind. She even went to extra trouble to make our arrival extra easy parking wise since we were arriving late at night which showed extra care. Definitely recommend. Thank you, Abigail!"

I came in late and did not catch the host(s) in the morning but though there was no in person interaction, Abigail was always quick to respond to messages ahead of the stay and flexible, kind, and friendly.

Stayed one night",Just here for a quick overnight stay and got in a little late (845p). Place was very clean and updated inside. I parked just past driveway b/c its on a short corner and didn't want to block mailbox. Theres some noise from the highway but thats expected (you can see from map view) and if you need a little white noise you can use your phone for an app. Place was well kept and clean. Not much space in room but if you need to leave luggage outside the room plenty space in living area. I just sat on porch talking to a friend then ate a late quick meal and went to bed. good place for touch and go. Its in an area being redeveloped so parts of neighborhood old but being revamped.

Group trip","We loved everything about the lodge, it was even prettier than the pictures! Beautiful, clean accommodations, and surroundings. Dena provided extra amenities like fresh flowers, and Christmas decor that made us feel right at home! The lodge had nice, comfy beds, and furniture with extra cozy blankets and lots of room for our big family. We loved the pellet fireplace, and game table along with the outside deck with a hammock which was great for drinking coffee and watching the sunrise, so peaceful. The 2 kitchens were awesome with very nice cookware, coffee pots etc. just everything you may need! Having 3 beautiful bathrooms with plenty of supplies and toiletries was wonderful. When we needed anything, Dena was quick to attend to our needs. We hope to stay again at we now call our Christmas Lodge."

Also, the host is incredibly kind, personable, and quick to respond. We had a minor issue with the A/C (definitely user error on our part), and even though it was late, Angela responded quickly and was so helpful to get it resolved. We appreciate that a lot! :) She also helped us with recommendations for restaurants and other things like advice on parking around town which is always great.
Will definitely stay here again if we have another event in LR!"

Things I like about the Craftsman: (1) big comfy bed, (2) big closet with good wood hangars (those are hard to come by in most Airbnb's), (3) everything works - the stove, microwave, TV, coffee, washer/dryer - and they work every time I'm there, (4) the front porch (another thing that many similar places lack), (5) good linens and towels, and (6) Angela and her team are always available and helpful. This place is easy to ""highly recommend"". Two thumbs up for the Historic Craftsman!"

Stayed a few nights","We have stayed once before at Angela's AirBnb. Not only was she quickly responsive to requests, she followed up to make certain that everything was good. As an example I had to ask for her to reprogram the mini-split HVAC to provide heat when the weather suddenly turned much cooler than it had been when we arrived. She did this promptly and asked permission to enter the AirBnB while we were away in order to accomplish this. Then she followed up with a message to make certain that the heat was working and that we were comfortable again. This place was immaculate. We have tried to stay other times but found the unit was occupied on the dates we wanted, so we were really pleased to get this on our recent visit. We will stay again."

She always made sure I had everything I needed. As for the place - it is absolutely beautiful. It was very, very clean, comfortable, and I felt really safe there traveling as a solo female. I appreciated the little details in the apartment, as well as the snacks provided. I would highly recommend Angela's place to anyone visiting Little Rock, AR.

She was kind enough to turn the heat on prior to our arrival as the temp dropped from earlier in the day - and later checked on us to ensure we were set. The attention to detail throughout the space surprised me; she definitely has a knack for hospitality and obviously enjoys hosting.
We are in Little Rock a few times a year and will begin checking Angela's availability each and every time."

The host is a pleasure to deal with, so helpful, great communication and genuinely invested in you having a great stay. The space is wonderful, the pics are completely accurate but don’t do it justice. The bed is crazy comfortable (the host even shared the brand and type because I need one of those at home). I like most places I stay but having stayed in airbnbs in c.40+ states, this is right up there for me, a great experience. If I’m back in town, this is the only place I’m going to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Our recent stay was remarkable and is highly recommended if you’re considering such, too. The engagement, communications and considerations by Angela and Lynn were stellar examples of what you want out of a stay. This is a home away from home setup. They have done a beautiful job on the property restoration. That same detail and care poured into having the home ready for you. The details can be seen; the extra touches are evident. It even exceeds the accurate pics and descriptions the host provides. The porch is a great spot, too. The location is well-positioned and close proximity to Hillcrest, Central, Arts and River districts. Thanks for making us feel welcomed here! - Cheers"

This is honestly the first Airbnb I’ve ever had where they provided actual food in the cabinets, waters, no harsh rules or instructions for clean up. Just overall very clean and nice.
Communicator was flawless and we were able to enter the home almost immediately upon arrival."

We rested before heading out to dinner and the bed was just soo comfortable. We followed some of her suggestions from the house manual and so glad we did. We did trails and gardens in Hot Springs and we finished off with a climb of PinnacleMt, A Must! Thank you Angela for all your recommendations and for such a lovely place. Will highly recommend your place that might head that way ☺️"

Checking in was simple and the location was great. We felt safe and were surprised we were a close distance to the historic Central High School. Angela also offers great suggestions to local restaurants in a helpful guidebook.
The place itself is a beautiful restoration of Craftsman style houses. We were shocked when we walked in, so if you're a fan of the design like my daughter is you'll love it. The wifi is also fast with a nice roku tv.
Aesthetics aside it was very clean and well stocked. You truly felt comfortable in the space. Dishes, pots, and a gas stove were available to make your own meals. There was also complimentary coffee, tea, and snacks. The bathroom was realxing and the bed was comfortable after a long day of driving.
We wish we could give it more than 5 stars, will visit if we stop in AK again! :)"

The bed was extremely comfortable with beautiful linens on the bed and in the bathroom. The neighborhood is very quiet. We loved having a washer and dryer and took full advantage of the smart tv for an afternoon of laundry and binging on Netflix.
We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the neighborhood restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops. All the local recommendations from this host were fantastic. The house is close to so many wonderful destinations from the capitol and river market area to the governor's mansion and the hospital district."

Stayed a few nights","I stay here on a weekly and since I do a review every week I sometimes get a little lax due to the fact that the review is essentially the same every week - it's a great place to stay. Besides being clean and comfortable the Historic Craftsman has several features that are noteworthy. The closet is big and is well stocked with good wooden hangars - you just don't find that in very many places. The shower is roomy, water pressure is fine, and it's low-entry, which is good for me and my gamey knee! All the appliances are modern and they all work - again, that's not always the case elsewhere. There is a nice front porch to sit on; this is really nice and helps you feel more ""at home""; I've often had a little snack out there after a long day of work. Angela even has ""to-go"" coffee cups so that you can take coffee with you when you check out and get back on the road home. Speaking of Angela - she and her crew do a great job of maintaining the place and communicating with guests!"

Stayed a few nights",This place is a gem! It’s beautifully restored and is surrounded by other historic Victorian and craftsman homes. It was immaculately clean and well appointed without being cluttered. Our host was friendly and took care of every detail. It is perfect for a stay in Little Rock.

Stayed one night","My partner and I were looking for a place to crash on our way to California, and Angela’s place was a perfect pit stop. Super cozy little spot in a beautiful craftsman-style house. I especially appreciated Angela’s attention to detail with the little things like providing snacks and also eye masks/ear buds for sleeping. Would absolutely stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights",1414 S Summit St was a great craftsman home. Loved the exterior color choice. Nice front port. Wonderful river rock inside and outside. Momma Lyn was sweet as can be. She greated as we arrived and as we departed. That touch makes you feel welcome. Thanks Lyn. The inside was clean and roomy. Kitchen worked perfect. Bathroom was clean and bright. I appreciate good lighting. Very relaxing living room as we watched Netflix every evening. I like this home alot. It’s nice to see older neighborhoods being kept up. So many older neighborhoods just deteriorate and there are so many good ones across American cities with wonderful architecture. This neighborhood brought back childhood memories visiting Aunts/Uncles and Grandparents. Kudos too the owners for investing in the home. Thank you

Stayed a few nights","Excellent all around and very comfortable. The historic architecture is a huge bonus, too. For the price, the quality of this Airbnb stay is a steal. The hosts could have easily charged more and I would still consider the stay a good value."

Stayed one night","We loved this place! If I could give it 10 stars, it still wouldn’t be enough! It was better than I could’ve imagined! The hosts were exceptionally friendly and the home was just gorgeous! I felt like I was walking into a featured home in a magazine. One thing that stood out the most that I I hadn’t seen in other Airbnb’s was local art that was available for purchase. The best way to help promote local artists! I can easily see this home becoming a super host in no time! If there’s availability, seriously get it, you won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed about a week","My second time to stay in Angela's AirBnB. There's a reason for this: it's a really nice space in the beautiful Quapaw Historic District, and the thoughtfully restored home has lots of amenities. It's very comfortable, and Angela is super friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for getting anywhere in Little Rock. I encourage taking time to learn about the history of the neighborhood, the Quapaw, and Central High School while you're there."

The bathroom was immaculate, the living room and kitchen were aesthetically pleasing. If you’re ever in the area be sure to book with Angela she was the best!"

Stayed one night","We stayed at Angela's cozy cute craftsman home in Little Rock, AR traveling to & from a family gathering. (2 nights) Home was beautifully restored with modern comfortable décor. Home is super clean, organized, fluffy towels, comfy bed & all kitchen amenities if wanting to prepare a snack or meal. Coffee pods & little snack items were a welcome treat. Angela was accommodating to our late afternoon request to book for the night & later arrival. Communication was superb!! Easy entry into home with key pad. Angela checked on us to make sure we had everything during our stay & was helpful with restaurant selections. We are new users to Airbnb & all experiences have been great, but Angela's was the BEST home we have booked!! We highly recommend this home when staying in Little Rock!! :)"

Stayed a few nights","We loved the original details of this historic bungalow. It is spacious, impeccably clean, and lovingly decorated. The area is going through obvious gentrification and this particular street is absolutely lovely. The location is a quick 10 minute drive to numerous restaurants and pubs. We hope to stay again when visiting our daughter."

Stayed a few nights","Very comfortable! We enjoyed our stay and all Little Rock has to offer. We found the provided information and brochures very helpful when deciding where to go and what to do. The house is beautiful and very comfortable. We didn't plan on coming to Little Rock but availability of flights made it necessary... It worked out great! There is so much to see and do. The next time we are headed to Memphis/Millington we will probably choose to fly into Little Rock. We visited 2 (of the 52!!!) State Parks and rode the trolley. We also visited Hot Springs National Park... hindsight we should have stayed all 3 nights in this house not one day in a Hot Springs airbnb. Definitely worth the commute back and forth to Hot Springs to be able to stay in such a comfortable place. Thank you, Angela!"
