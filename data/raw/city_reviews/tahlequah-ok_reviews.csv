Stayed with kids","This was our 2nd AirBnB. What a beautiful home, classic beauty. Wonderful touches. Very welcoming, and cozy. We even had delicious homemade cookies left for our arrival. Plenty of blankets and pillows. Secure touch panel not facing peering eyes to gain entry. Great outdoor enclosed patio in the back to sit and relax, w/ binoculars and a bird book. Set back off the road for peace and quite, country feel. Book of other guests comments, we left ours as well. Felt safe. Main drag shopping nearby. This is definitely a must stay if we're in the area again."

We experienced a bit of nostalgia with the vinyl record offerings and enjoyed our time out on the screened in patio. The hummingbirds were nearby during our coffee the next morning on the patio. We were particularly thrilled to find half-and-half in the refrigerator for our coffee – and we loved the scones that the hosts had provided!! The master bedroom bed was comfortable, the master bath shower was enormous and all of our needs were satisfied. We recommend this lovely home in a rural setting."

The paved road and driveway with a large pull in garage was amazing as well. Sitting off the road we experienced no traffic noise and enjoyed the peace and quiet. We will be booking again when back in the area."

Stayed with kids",Sue’s place by far exceeded all of my expectations. The property is so quiet and beautiful and the cottage has all of the personal touches of home. We wished it was our actual home! Our 1 year old pushed her walker up and down the long driveway and I was able to get a long run in on some nearby dirt roads. We were close to all of the family we wanted to spend time with and were able to explore downtown easily as well. I wish we’d have been in town longer to enjoy the cottage even more. The beds and sheets were so soft and we had everything we needed in the kitchen as well. One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in and we can’t wait to come back and stay longer.

Stayed with kids","This little home was a wonderful surprise, Sue's thoughtful touches, the scenery, and the house itself was like going home to see my Mom! We loved the fresh baked banana muffins, the screened in porch, comfy couches, and TV's in living room, and bedroom. My grandson loved, loved, loved the screened in porch, he insisted we have each meal out there. Sitting on the porch we had soft comfy chairs, listened the soft sounds of rain, and melodic sound of the soothing wind chimes, we Soo enjoyed Sue's warm, quaint, quite little house. It was by far the best bnb we have ever stayed at! The beautiful little family of Cardinals were also a most blessed and prefect scene to watch while sitting in cozy screened porch. Loved everything about this warm little home and look forward to going back soon."

Stayed one night","This delightful cottage is an absolute delight! If you ever find yourself coming to Tahlequah, book it! It is located on the edge of Tahlequah and is so peaceful!
Easy to find, parking is more than ample. It is a spacious cottage, welcoming and cozy with every little amenity you can think of. We were delighted to find a record player in the living room and immediately put on a Jimmy Buffet album!
You’ll be super impressed with how sparkling clean everything is, and all the thoughtful little touches, bottled water in the fridge, awesome dispenser lotions in the shower, fluffy towels and such a comfortable bed!
Sue has truly shared her flare of putting together a quintessential home away from home.
And remember what I said in the first sentence? If you’re coming to Tahlequah, book it!"

Stayed one night","If I could give 6 stars I would! The attention to detail and thoughtful consideration of the traveler was just over the top. Lovely property. Relaxing. Peaceful. We wanted to get away from the chaos of life for a night so we booked a quick getaway an hour from home. My husband and I never even touched our phones. We played cards that were provided and simply enjoyed one another’s company. The cabin is exceptionally clean, stocked, and well cared for. I appreciate the hosts going above and beyond. This is the second best getaway location I’ve ever been to, just after Yellowstone National Park. The only recommendation I have is that if you are concerned about privacy (although there are no buildings that could offer a direct view nearby, so it really shouldn’t be any issue) that you bring a little pop up car window shade or something because the kitchen window doesn’t have a curtain.
Fantastic. Will visit again. Will recommend!!!"

Also, we were given excellent recommendations for food. I absolutely loved water mill, the cows we could see from porch swing, and everything you needed to enjoy a wonderful night.

Stayed a few nights","It was just my husband and I for the weekend and our first time staying in a tiny house; we loved it. Misty and Tony thought of every possible thing you could need for your stay. The house was spotlessly clean, nice sized bathroom and shower, soft towels, comfortable bed, pillows and blankets. The futon couch in the living room isn't real comfortable, so if you plan to use it as an extra sleeping area, you may want to bring a full size air mattress to place on top. It's a beautiful drive or walk through the ranch to the Flat Rock area on the river. We spent a few hours out there swimming and visiting with the rafters and floaters. It is a beautiful area on the river! We'd like to visit again with our teenage kids and reserve the larger A frame house. They were jealous when they saw the pictures we took at the Flat Rocks. Great place to stay, beautiful, little tiny house."

I’ve never given a tiny house a try. It was perfect for us. The cliffside behind and the large open fields across the road or breathtaking! The huge fire pit adds the perfect touch for a nice evening. It was soooooooo quiet! Loved it and plan to come back"

Stayed one night","Beautiful tiny house on a lovely farm across from a pasture with deer bounding through. We enjoyed having coffee on the porch swing listening to the sounds of nature and seeing the deer. Bonus points for cows and horses on the road to the house. This previous small farm girl from upstate NY loved the country environment. Well kept clean house! Such a great use of space and well stocked with supplies. I wish we had spent more time there to explore the land but we were passing through on our Midwest journey on a visit from our home in Alaska.
Absolutely beautiful and I highly recommend!"

The home was clean, easy to find, and super comfortable. It was super hot while we were there, but even with the A/C set at 74-75, we were completely comfortable (that's our usual setting at home, and with the wonderful ceiling fans I even found myself a little chilly and had to turn the fan off!). The hosts are wonderful, communicated in advance the check in and check out instructions. We appreciated the welcome binder with restaurant recommendations. The pastries to welcome us were a lovely touch and made the kids super excited. Thank you all for a wonderful stay!"

Perfectly located, this property is nestled in a quiet neighborhood, across the street from a wooded creek area and park (and less than 1/2 mile from restaurants and retail stores). The beds were super comfortable, the sheets were extremely soft (900 thread count?), the decor was fresh & fashionably designed. All appliances, lighting & plumbing fixtures were new, functional and beautiful. The furnishings were superior to any we've had before. The property exudes classic relaxation! Jessie understands hospitality - and it shows. She was so thoughtful - she even had fresh flowers (and muffins from Morgan's Bakery) for us when we arrived! We really didn't want to leave, but we will definitely be back. Great experience!!"

The rooms were really big, and there were tons of windows. Since most days were sunny, this was great - always lots of beautiful light. It truly is easily walkable to the main street (Muscogee St) in the historic district. The Cherokee Nation's museums are there, as are numerous shops, galleries, and restaurants. It's also fun to walk the nearby neighborhoods. I think there are buildings from every decade from the mid-1800s to today. Rhonda was helpful, almost immediately responding to any question we had. The house is very private and has a large, fenced backyard. The house is well supplied with just about anything you would need. We would definitely want to stay here if we come back to the area. Highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","The stay was fantastic! Hoping to get my whole family into both of their cabins sometime this fall for a trip down the river! Was immaculately clean! I'm kind of a clean freak. ; )
Phil was super accommodating! Super close to the float companies! Amazing view of the river and the valley, and could see the Cabin from the river when we floated by. Bald eagle was perched on a tree close to the back porch and watched it soar over the valley for a few moments. Could see dear down by the river too.
Kids had a blast swimming on the small peddle beach on the property even though the river seemed up a bit. Roasted marshmallows at the huge fire ring and the boys played on the hammock. Phil even brought over some yard games!
Peaceful and serene!"

Group trip","The house is lovely and rustic; woodworking on the inside is beautiful and homey. There are many books and games in the house, and the living room chairs are particularly comfortable. The lighting in the house is quite cozy, too. We stayed one night for a bachelor trip, and all the guys enjoyed it. The cinnamon rolls in the kitchen are real and delicious! We also met the host - very kind woman!
The creek in the back is pristine and ice cold... refreshing! Trampolining was fun too!
The house makes efficient use of space; it looks smaller from the outside but has plenty on the inside. With that, the smaller bathroom and shower are not very spacious, but the larger bathroom with the tub has plenty of room. The upstairs has a lower clearance-you'll have to bend down a little to get through the doors. The 4 bunk beds and 1 nook bed are smaller, though we slept adult men in them just fine. They would be great kids' beds for sure.
One negative point was low air circulation in some bedrooms."

The only thing I would say is if you have a bad back like me, back a mattress topper, one of the beds is super super comfy but the other two are a bit to firm (this is a taste/preference thing though nothing was wrong with the bed just too firm for my weary bones lol I gave my mom the comfy bed). Has really good amenities the dart board and the pool table are awesome. Would have like to do a longer stay to get to enjoy the backyard and bbq and all the board games."

Stayed with a pet","We traveled to Rose Bud Retreat over Thanksgiving weekend. There was 5 adults and 5 dogs. The layout of the house was perfect, very roomy and the game room was nice. Kennels fit nicely by the back door away from bedrooms, back yard was fully fenced so they could run. We did bring our halo fence and was glad because the gate is a little loose and then we didn’t have to worry about it. Kitchen is well stocked for normal meals we brought a few things ourselves and glad we did. But hosts did offer to have everything we needed there I just thought it was easier for me to bring it myself. Host was in communication multiple times during visit, we will definitely keep this place in mind again."

The patio was nice but the mosquitoes are terrible. Seems secluded from the patio, but the street noise is terrible. Water pressure for a shower is great. Needs a need Keurig. Lovely wine glasses. I liked the tv was already logged into Netflix. The bedding was quality. Only room for one car to park there but that’s all we needed. But if you need more parking than that, it would be a struggle. Fresh flowers were put out. Those were pretty. Plenty of clean supplies. The appliances are top notch."

I regularly come to town for work at one of the hospitals. This location makes it very convenient to respond while on call. The best endorsement one can give is to rebook after an initial stay. I have booked all of my stays going forward with Edna at this location!

I’m definitely booking here in the future when I visit my family. There’s nothing else quite like it. If you’re a clean freak like me, the place is spotless. You don’t have to worry about the previous occupants’ cooties. Finally, if you’re a security expert/freak like me, you’ll be glad to know there are no hidden cameras, so no need to worry about being spied on like you hear about with some other Airbnb sites."

Stayed one night",This was a great little apartment close to everything. Super super cute and very functional. Very clean. The bed was great for me but hubby didn't love it. A little firm for his taste but it's was really not that firm. So many pillows! They didn't skimp on the pillows! Wish we could have stayed longer and taken advantage of the nice deck. It was a little noisy being right off the main road but we turned on the AC fan and it covered up most of the traffic noise. Would definitely stay there again if in the area.

The apartment is on the second floor above a Tattoo shop, in walking distance to some coffee shops and stores. There’s a little alley at the bottom of the stairs, where you could park your car for free. The deck is wonderful and surrounded by trees, great for evening sips. Even though the apartment is located on a relatively busy street, it is not facing it and it was actually very quiet at night.
Edna was a great host, very communicative and hospitable throughout our stay.
We would love to return in the near future and would absolutely recommend Edna’s lovely apartment to anyone looking for a cozy and comfortable place to stay in Tahlequah!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautifully decorated space. Everything you might need is available. Another reviewer said it was in an industrial area, but in my opinion that’s inaccurate. It’s basically located between the college area and the newer shopping/Casino area. A few older houses across the street, and older shopping area surrrounding it, but it’s right there on the Main Street that runs from the newer Shopping area to the college campus.
The only issue I had was that there was a lot of street noise through the night, cars mostly, but if you live in the city that probably wouldn’t be noticed. (We live in the country and are used to quiet nights.)"

So, while the place overall was glowing for me the only thing I would mention for future renters is that if you want a place to go outside and walk around to see the sights it probably wouldn't be the best. The area nearby is pretty industrial, but there are things a short drive away. Inside though, everything is perfect!"

Everything was well equipped and well prepared and very clean, and close by downtown Tahlequah. The host’s communication was clear and responded quickly. The only negatives were: 1) no central heat and air, although there were plenty of space heaters available. And 2) it was located in a somewhat iffy looking area and there was some yelling and fighting at the house across the street, as well as a random stray dog wandering near the patio (not at all the host’s fault, but something to be aware of)."

Stayed a few nights","What a Tahlequah Treasure!! Super clean, very stylish, and extraordinarily welcoming and homey! Edna was very quick to respond to requests, questions, and even silly inquiries.
We simply LOVED this little Hideaway loft! Enjoyed some wine in the comfy back patio and slept like babies in the big ole king bed. Even our dog was better rested after our time there. The loft and Edna were amazing- HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"

The only recommendation that I have is that if you are a light sleeper bring some ear plugs or a white noise machine since the hideaway is on a fairly busy street and it was pretty noisy at night.
Overall, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again if I’m back in Tahlequah."

Stayed about a week","The Hideaway is a great option for a stay in Tahlequah. My wife and I spent eight nights there and really enjoyed it. It's a loft above a retail space but the way access is set up it's very private and feels very secure. My wife was impressed with the décor, the bed was comfortable, the kitchen was well provisioned and it was quite clean.
Edna was great to work with and very responsive. There was an ice storm the day of our departure that coated the access stairway. It was icy enough that I wouldn't have tried to walk down it empty-handed, much less with heavy suitcases. I contacted Edna and within 30 minutes a guy showed up and scattered rock salt on the deck and stairs and when we loaded up our luggage about an hour later the ice was a non-issue.
If you’re going to Tahlequah and you want a private, comfortable and well-appointed place to stay give The Hideaway a try."

Stayed a few nights","I had an excellent stay at Edna’s place! The loft is located on the Main Street, but traffic noise wasn’t a problem. I was traveling alone & arrived at dusk, & I must admit that I was a bit apprehensive at first as the building next door (on the other side of a six foot privacy fence), seemed “creepy”. I contacted Edna, who responded immediately & set my mind at ease. I was delighted with the deck with its outdoor lights, which looked so inviting. There’s a stackable washer & dryer, gorgeous gas stove, full sized refrigerator & an electric fireplace. The loft is stylish and comfortable and perfectly clean. There’s a cozy king bed and a futon sofa in the living room for extra sleeping options. I felt completely at ease and wouldn’t hesitate to book Edna’s again!"

The cabin is equipped with everything you’d need — kitchen equipment, shampoos & soaps, cleaning supplies. The bed was comfortable & between the screen sliding door or the climate control unit, it is easy to get the temperature of the room just right for sleeping. The hot tub was all ready to go, and like everything else, it was perfectly maintained.
The river view is just incredible. Like another world. I can see why Mitch says the river gets into your soul. We cannot wait to come back!"

The views were absolutely beautiful and we arrived to a bald eagle greeting us across the river. We got to see lots of wildlife and enjoyed it! The views were just stunning and we highly enjoyed the hot tub! Mitch was so kind and very responsive and made sure we were doing good with these crazy cold temperatures. We cannot wait to come back again in the summer and enjoy getting in the river! We tried to go to double r&p for dinner due to seeing it had great reviews but I would call ahead if you go in the colder temps, they were closed due to no water. We ended up at Callahan’s in Arkansas and it was just a good! Thanks again Mitch for a great peaceful getaway! We highly recommend you giving it a try."

The decor is perfect and cozy, furniture is comfy (bed is pretty firm, but not a complaint), and the place is well-stocked with everything you need, from spices, corkscrew, and utensils to coffee! There is a learning curve with the induction stove, however, Mitch gives great instructions. The hot tub was perfect and we even saw shooting stars! No light pollution of any kind made the night sky incredible. Though we went in Arctic temps, the other places near ours are spaced out enough I still think we’d have plenty of privacy. The access to the river makes us excited to come back this summer! Mitch is a great host, very responsive and accommodating."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I have now dubbed Mitch’s place “Our Cabin in the Woods” because we plan on returning so frequently! It’s quaint and perfect for a peaceful, private getaway. It had everything we needed (even half n half for the coffee!). The bed was comfortable, the furnishings are new and comfortable. The hot tub was clean and well-maintained. Our favorite thing about Mitch’s place, however, was the view out the back. It’s breathtaking. We stayed 3 nights and 4 days, and we were blessed to witness a family of 4 bald eagles (2 adults and 2 juveniles) each day we were there.
If you have some time and want a good steak, make the trek to Double R & P’s in Westville. It’s a big “barn” literally in the middle of nowhere. Best steak we’ve ever had in a restaurant (and we’re steak people). And Mitch’s place has a great fridge so you can keep your leftovers for breakfast!"

We made the most of the hot tub every morning and evening; we looked out at the river and the trees; what a picturesque place to be with some wine and mimosas. We had a fire on the balcony at night and will certainly be back! This place is fantastic and of great value, and Mitch made it very easy with the directions and communication. Thank you, sir!"

Had a running and gravel cycling event nearby and simply had a wonderful time. Been awhile since I have been to Tahlequah (20 min away), has not changed much. Overall, I really liked Mitch & Jody's dream for getting away - it was well appointed, clean, not too big, fancy in the right places, and yet super simple to just sit on the deck on the Andirondack chairs and look at the stars and the every flowing Illinois river! Even saw a large gathering of Egrets at night - some sort of commotion or territorial thing - not sure, need to look it up! Huge thank you!"

Group trip","Five of stayed completely comfortable in the house. Nice living room, good tv channels. We spent a lot of time outdoor since the weather was so nice. Really enjoyed the back yard picnic table, and the outdoor lights were a nice touch. The front porch swing was a plus. The kitchen had what was needed for cooking meals. Very spacious. Good location, close to everything, downtown, the river, a park, restaurants and the casino. I would definitely recommend this house and would definitely stay here again if my travels took me that way again. Thank you."

We relaxed, played games and ate way too much. I enjoyed my morning coffee on the porch swing and after retreated back to the amazing air conditioned home. Thanks again for your hospitality."

Walking distance to many restaurants, including Sam & Ella's pizza, boutiques and park. Loved the farmer's market on Saturday morning with food trucks! We had coffee and breakfast at The Lift around the corner. We walked a couple of blocks and went through the Cherokee Nation museums (they were awesome!). We enjoyed the front porch swing in the evenings and loved the back porch and barbecue grill. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. It had everything we needed to make our stay perfect!

There’s even various chargers for your use and smart TVs throughout the home! WiFi that’s fast! The yard is spacious and very cleaned up. We were left wanting for nothing as the kitchen was fully stocked and the bathrooms had toilet paper and lots of clean towels. The keurig with pods was a bonus we took advantage of!

Stayed a few nights","First appearances were nice but there were a few things that were off putting. Both shower heads were awful, spraying water in every direction but where it’s supposed to go, making it very hard to wash long hair. There was some trash on the floor in the closet, stained towels, the bath mat was already damp, bedroom rug needed to be vacuumed, and a noticeable layer of dust on the ceiling fans. The bed was so hard we both woke up aching. The sofa felt like it might collapse. The house also isn’t level, it almost felt like walking in a fun house at first. We only stayed in the main bedroom, so could have missed some things in the others. One or two of these issues could be overlooked, but for the price point, I’d expect it to be a bit more clean, comfortable, and functional."

The house was clean and well stocked with full size shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Plenty of towels and all request upon leaving the house were easy to obtain. I will say the coffee was French roast which I’m not a fan but my sister house by the same host had some regular and they worked out fine. Neighborhood wasn’t what I expected but seemed fine and we never worried about the safety of our cars or things. I would definitely stay here again. Great job Edna."

Stayed a few nights",This was our second stay. We have enjoyed it and hope to get to visit again soon. We get to visit with our daughter that lives there. We love the surroundings and that Cordelia is there if needed or request her help but otherwise you just get to enjoy your stay without interruption. Thank you again for a wonderful visit. It was relaxing for us especially this time since the towns where we live and work were hit by tornadoes two weeks before our visit. It was so nice to have a place to rest. We did not suffer any damage but the loss to our communities was great and it was nice to get away for a couple of days. Our trip was planned before the tornadoes and we were ready to have a restful quite place to stay.

We loved the outdoor pavilion and the friendly chickens that occasionally roamed about the property. The property is in a quiet leafy neighborhood and is only blocks from town center.
Cordelia replied quickly and was helpful. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The Smokehouse is a family favorite; so cute, comfy, and accommodating. Cordelia has it stocked with everything we would need for a stay in Tahlequah. With a daughter in college at NSU, we are in town from Dallas often. I've tried other Airbnbs when popping in alone and wanting to be closer to events and activities concerning my university student, but have to say, Cordelia's is the best value by far for all she provides- plus, she's still in close enough proximity to the college and town. Highly, highly recommend! We will be back, again and again."

Stayed a few nights","I've been interested in Cordelia's Cherokee smokehouse listing for some time, and our recent visit did not disappoint. The place was perfect for time spent in beautiful Tahlequah with my son, getting my daughter settled into NSU. I needed to work which I was able to enjoy on the veranda looking out over the chickens with no problems due to strong wifi. (Great change of pace as opposed to my peers who were Zoom meeting with me from our Dallas conference room and the trafffic that many were late because of and complaining about!) The smokehouse is close to the main house but we never saw another soul except Cordelia, and only upon our arrival. Though we ate our meals in town, the place has everything one might need for a stay. I particularly enjoyed the cute bathroom and modern shower. I'll be visiting my daughter very often and will look to book with Cordelia again soon."

Stayed a few nights","The smokehouse was absolutely beautiful! Cordelia was very friendly and a great host overall. We spent our first night enjoying the porch-swings on the outdoor covered patio. There were outdoor fans and provided bug spray which was a great addition! The shower had consistent temperature and was very spacious. The covered parking area was nice; though, do note that larger vehicles may not fit as well. Our full-size pickup made it, but we had to tuck in the side mirrors. One last thing to note, our maps app took us to the wrong street. I submitted a request on the maps app to adjust the directions, but if you’re lost, just search for The Blue Feather Bed and Breakfast. Overall a great stay!"

Beds were comfortable, the house was clean and the kitchen was stocked with anything needed for cooking a meal. The area around the house would be fabulous to sit outside and relax the day away, it rained most of the time we were there so we didn’t get to enjoy that. Cordelia made check-in easy and even texted to check on us after we arrived. We would definitely stay here again!"

Ample heaters or AC to regulate the temp to your desired level throughout the dwelling major plus in my book. We only used the downstairs bed but the upstairs appeared to the same quality as downstairs bed and I found it quite comfortable. Parking was ample and directions were both concise and accurate. All and all a fantastic stay and we are quite interested in a stay at the BnB as well as a repeat stay at The Smokehouse.

Stayed a few nights","I honestly said ""I think I could live here!""
This place is a wonderfully planned out small space. Hooks, shelving, nooks all in the right places. I didn't have enough time in town to fully enjoy this lovely home, but the time I did have just made me happy. Don't forget to peek under the stairs :)
I really enjoyed choosing from a nice selection of different pottery mugs for my coffee. Huge, beautifully tiled shower with no water issues was also very nice. Many of the switches in the home are labeled, which I very much appreciate.
Cozy, fluffy and warm bedding made for a great night's sleep. Plenty of space heaters available for any comfort level on cool spring nights.
The sitting area in the living space was great for reading next to a large clean window that brought the outside in. It was a bit cool for me to enjoy the front door chairs which listen into a gentle trickling fountain and nature calls of birds, but the indoor space was lovely, too.
I had been traveling a bit, so the washer and dryer were a big bonus to run a small load to get me through my next several days.
If you're away from your home church, I found Roots Church in downtown Tahlequah at the old Dream Theater to be a welcoming family on the Sunday I was passing through.
Close to the city and happenings and highways, yet a very quiet neighborhood secluded by the trees of the property. I really enjoyed being here and also knowing its history was pretty cool, too."

Stayed a few nights","Cordelia was a hospitable host and has a beautiful property. My family enjoyed the extensive outdoor space by grilling out on the nearby patio, watching the chickens, and enjoying the flowers and fountain. Cordelia was open to our suggestions to make the stay even better for future guests, and we could tell she loves having people in her Airbnb and bed & breakfast. It was a great weekend!"

Stayed a few nights","Cordelia was so welcoming and kind. She has created a truly special experience for travelers. The pictures didn't even come close to representing the beauty of this space and the property! The garden and fountain are gorgeous (and there are chickens!) Everything was so well thought out and exceptional. I highly recommend! It is also close to downtown, nature trails, etc."

Stayed one night","Cherie was so quick to respond to my questions about booking with such short notice due to severe storms requiring us to find shelter in town. Not only was she quick to respond but very personable and kind. The house is very tastefully decorated and appears to be newly renovated. It is also so close to NSU and the downtown area.
I highly recommend this place!"

Stayed with a pet","Cute, cute house - you can tell everything has been thoughtfully remodeled. Plenty of room for three couples (and a pup). Thoughtful touches including a snack basket and wood for the fire pit. This was a great ""home base"" gathering for the holidays with family in Tahlequah. Would not hesitate to recommend. I hope we are able to enjoy Cheri's house again in the future."

Stayed with kids","This house is a great place to stay if you're in Tahlequah or this part of Oklahoma for all the outdoor beauty. The house is super charming, clean, and comfortable. It's exactly as described and really even nicer than the pictures. Very close to NSU campus and not far at all from all the shops/cafes/pubs/restaurants of downtown. Short easy drive to all the Illinois River activity. The host was very helpful and responsive. We stayed with our kids and dog and felt safe and comfortable, and we hope to stay here again. Thank you for a great stay!"
