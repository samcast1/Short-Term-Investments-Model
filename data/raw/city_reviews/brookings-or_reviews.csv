Stayed one night","Enjoyed my stay here. I felt safe & comfortable (very important, since I am a solo traveling female).
The host was awesome. So kind, friendly & helpful. I was coming from the Bay Area & they recommended sights I should see along the way.
He puts in effort to make the guests feel welcomed. The refrigerator even had water & sodas in it, which I think is soooo thoughtful!
I would recommend this place to anyone & would 100% stay again!"

Stayed one night","Cleanliness and responsiveness of operator was exceptional and very much appreciated. Would like to have had a comfortable chair or two. Bed was only option for sitting and reading. Small quarters created that limitation. Amenities such as coffee maker, creamers and sodas in the refer were great. We were a bit surprised at the limited size of the unit. Fine stay however for one night."

Stayed one night","We needed a place at the last minute and Richard‘s place fit the bill. It was close to where we were going to get dropped off at and it was close to where we needed to go. Richard was very friendly, communicative, and understanding of our situation. Richard went above and beyond with trying to help us out with our situation when we had an issue with our truck. We could not have asked for a more helpful, respectful, considerate host. It helps when your down to believe in human kind again. The space was clean, spacious and exactly what we needed to relax for the night before tackling our issue in the morning. Morning was Easter Sunday and more difficult to figure out our way…Richard was there to assist. We eventually got the help we needed and was just grateful to have this little airbnb to relax in. Coffee was good, everything worked out just fine. Kudos to the hosts."

Stayed with kids","The most valuable aspect of staying with Richard was that he was a wonderful travel host from the very beginning. He asked me where I was traveling from and made some great recommendations for things to do along the way. Watching the videos he sent would have been very helpful, but unfortunately, I missed it while I was driving which had some helpful directions. Since I arrived after dark, reviewing the directions closely was crucial to avoid any confusion. However, Richard was very responsive and called me to ensure I found the location. The apartment had a well-stocked coffee bar, a good-sized fridge with a separate freezer, a hot water kettle, and a microwave. My 9-year-old son and I had a comfortable night's sleep andeverything we needed to recharge before getting back on the road again. I would stay here again if I'm ever in the area."

I don't know if there are words to describe how incredible of a communicator Rich is. He gave us TONS of suggestions for places to visit, researched our route to give us heads up on what we might encounter and was an absolute gentleman throughout our communications."

Stayed one night",The room was clean and nice however we were taken surprise when we pulled up to see a Trump Flag very prominently displayed. Being LGBTQ+ travelers we would have hoped that was in the description so that we could have avoided an uncomfortable stay. We understand people have differing views but extreme political flags that are displayed on the premises should be included in the description

He had the little ""fire place"" going, it was a nice touch, very welcoming and thoughtful. He had some tea and coffee there along with everything you would need for a wonderful stay. Thank you for your generosity Richard, it was greatly appreciated."

Judy and I thoroughly enjoyed your place in Brookings. The video you sent, prior to our arrival was helpful and entertaining though we did use online maps, as is our custom, and found your place quite easily. Playful touches to interior design provided an inviting ambiance and expressed your love for your property and desire to please your guests."

Stayed a few nights","We had an absolutely amazing handful of days in Brookings, in large part to our wonderful accommodations. The suite was exactly as is pictured, and is in a wonderful, safe little neighborhood. We were able to ride in on our motorcycle without any issues, and we were able to walk to restaurants and the harbor, and anything else we wanted to do very easily. We had one minor issue with a coffee pot that went bad, and Richard very quickly brought over another one. His hospitality is unmatched. We truly appreciate how he went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our time on the coast. Living in Southern Oregon, my entire life, I’ve spent a lot of time on our coast, and going forward, we will use Richard’s “Seacation” as our main place to stay. Thank you again for such a wonderful time. We will see you next time."

Stayed a few nights","Sea-cation is hands down one of the best air bnbs we have ever stayed at. First off, the video instructions on how to find the air bnb are priceless, very easy to find. Rich and Cathy even texted us to make sure we were ok because it was late at night and we haven’t checked in yet, something I have yet to experience anywhere else. The suite was spotless, welcoming, and that bed was extremely cozy and comfortable. We are on a three week road trip and that is by far the best bed we have had. It truly felt like we were at a beach getaway. The location is peaceful and SAFE and tucked away from the busyness of the town, and a short walk to a good Irish pub and the rest of the quant boardwalk. Rich and Cathy’s guide book and recommendations are perfect as well, use them!"

Made us feel right at home and the place was very easy to find with his video instructions that he includes. Bathroom had REAL toilet paper, the nice Charmin stuff, so that's a win right there. Place was comfy, warm, nice TV, coffee maker, and he even stocks the mini fridge with some nice sodas/flavored waters. Would definitely stay again. Oh, and get the pizza at Fat Cat Pizza that is just nearby—super delicious pizza. Area around is fairly quiet and peaceful, plenty of food nearby, and you are on the beautiful Oregon Coast, what's more to say."

Richard provided a number of places to potentially explore. The room was more than comfortable. Little generous touches throughout with pops and ginger ales in the refrigerator, and coffee, teas and hot chocolate. Everything was clean and the beach theme was so fun. The bed was comfortable and overall our stay was quiet and private. Richard sent a message out of extra curtesy 2x in our 6 day, 5 night stay when moving his car and down by some yard work. We met the dogs and they were great too! Wonderful hosts, fantastic room, and rate. Would highly recommend them and would love to stay again in the future. We even touch a fresh octopus!

Days before check-in, Richard sent me a video detailing the directions and check-in instructions. I've never had that attentiveness experience before! When we arrived at the AirBnB we had our own parking space. For this AirBnB you are renting a room, but the room is separate from the house which allows you some peace and space. The room and bathroom was very clean and spacious. Richard also provided in-depth recommendations around Brookings. I would definitely come back to this AirBnB!"

This is for sure one of the best AirBnbs I have stayed at. There is a Keurig and mini-fridge freezer combo as well as a microwave. The space is small but homey and separated from their main home. I couldn't have asked for better hosts! I will be staying another week in this Airbnb but couldn't wait to leave my initial review. Dont miss out on this one!

Eliza was welcoming and responsive, and the cabin was clean with a well-equipped kitchen. The deck overlooking forest and ocean, clawfoot tub, and sauna were among the highlights. We hope to return again soon!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved the cabin from the moment we walked in. It was immaculately clean, tidy and organized. The house is so creative and with all the windows you feel as if you are outside. You can open the house up and hear all the birds singing their beautiful songs. The beds are comfortable with very nice bedding and plenty of space to put your personal items. The views from both upstairs and downstairs are spectacular. It’s close enough to Brookings to make it convenient but far enough out of town to feel remote. There are neighbors around the cabin, but we never saw or heard them. You feel like you are alone on top of the hill. The sauna and the bath tub are perfect after a day of hiking. Soaking in the tub with the view is incredible. We only wished we stayed longer than four nights. We love this place and can’t wait to go back."

The two bedrooms upstairs were awesome. The bedding was perfect.
Both of us slept like babies.! This house was truly built by a very gifted man.
The retro decoration was so cool !
Beautiful healthy plants and Wood burning fireplace made it extra special oh so pretty at night in the living room,🤣😘 Thank you, Eliza and the rest

Close to restaurants and farmers markets and all of the neat things Brookings has like breweries, a great theatre, and shopping if you need it.

Stayed a few nights","We were definitely expecting a more secluded stay, but between the neighbors’s dog barking night & day, and being able to clearly hear the other neighbors conversation next door while sitting on the deck, we felt the whole point of “getting away from it all” was a bit lost.
The main bathroom is in desperate need of updating. We began to dread using the shower (the shower-head was ancient and coated in plaque, while the shower itself was cracked and stained) and avoided using the downstairs toilet because it would make odd noises for several minutes.
For the good: the sauna was great, and the clawfoot tub with its view saved the trip for us. And the proximity to hiking trails and the distance between Brookings and Gold Beach was ideal.
Of note: the bedrooms had no curtains which meant the sun didn’t let us sleep past 6 am."

Stayed with kids","A great place right on the cliff above Chetco Cove with fabulously large windows that allow gazing in 180 degree direction and in view of lovely sunrises and sunsets at this time of year. Sitting outside on the deck would be great when it’s warm, dry, and sunny.
The house is furnished in a contemporary style with all amenities you could need and want, within walking distance to Chetco Point, Fred Meyer store, restaurants, bars, the jetty, etc, and in a very quiet neighborhood.
The 6 of us had plenty of room to spread out and play games, chat, or retreat to a quiet corner.
It’s very bright in the daytime but lacks sufficient lighting in the living room, making it hard to use the huge sectional couch for reading or games for these non-TV users. We ended up all sitting under one lamp on the floor while the large couch was unused.
Thank you, Holly, for sharing your great home with us. We hope to be back!"

It’s breathtaking views, comfortable beds, luxurious toiletries, incredible showers, that master bathroom tub is a must-do, and even all the fixtures throughout the house. We wanted to move in and never leave. The design and decor are awesome and amazing and we would love to know who came up with this masterpiece. Holly was great as well; we had a couple of questions and she got right back to us. The check-in process was easy and the interactions dealing with everything were completely seamless.

Stayed with kids","The home is gorgeous- the finishes were exquisite, there is so much space with quality appliances and amenities. It felt very comfortable and clean.
The location is close to a small rocky beach below. The view is amazing: bird watching and seals, along with watching the fishermen along the jetty. Lots of extras in the home- well stocked kitchen. Beautiful deck with gas fire pit.
Things to consider: the kids room is more like a closet w/windows with no blinds or drapes. The cots (not beds, smaller than a twin) aren’t suitable for anyone over the age of 12. The beds in the other spacious rooms should be upgraded to kings- they seem like very small queen beds. The silverware is gold plated and can’t go in the dishwasher, front light (and camera) flash on all night leading to light in the downstairs bedroom. The art is different: naked paintings, photo of boy peeing (his head only but ugh), kids room had photo of girls in bikinis.
Quiet gorgeous stay in a beautiful spacious home."

Well stocked with so many items to make your stay comfortable. Excellent for those who want to stay and just enjoy the view without going anywhere as well as for others and want to get out and explore the beaches in trails. We would love to go back!

Stayed with kids","Holly's Brookings Beach House is truly as advertised - a stunning oceanfront home! Walking into the home was magical. The home is spacious; beautifully designed and decorated; outfitted with plethora thoughtful amenities that put the icing on the cake; and, well, THE VIEW. Over four days of our stay we kept wondering whether we'd start take it for granted - sitting on the deck in the morning, drinking coffee and watching the ospreys and herons hunting for their breakfast; relaxing on the extremely cozy sofas; cooking meals in the awesome kitchen - but, no, every day was special and at the end of it we left reluctantly, and hoping to come back again soon."

Rightfully so! Everything was so clean, the vibe was lovely, homey and had amazing charm. Just my style. The little dessert was such a lovely thoughtful touch and I was impressed how functional the kitchen was for being such a small space. You really did an awesome job making such a small space feel so roomy and functional. 💪🏼 interior design and functionality is such a thing for me and you did a wonderful job with this airbnb.

The amount of thought and attention to detail that went into the space is incredible. Willow has clearly gone above and beyond to be the hostess with the mostest! The space is so cozy, comfortable and relaxing. We slept wonderfully on the bed, found the kitchenette to be beyond sufficiently stocked, and enjoyed all the warm and inviting details like fresh eggs from Willow’s backyard hens, mini faux fireplace heater, fuzzy robes and slippers & complimentary bottle of wine. We also loved that it was walking distance to Azalea park, and half a mile to most of Brookings best eateries, etc. For the price, this Airbnb far exceeded our expectations.

Now if you want a beach front ocean view this is not it because it is in a residential quiet neighborhood. It is a beautiful,clean and absolutely lovely place to stay. Willow was wonderful. She answers text or calls right away and she is just a very thoughtful person. Lots of extra touches and her backyard is very private and feels like a oasis in a residential neighborhood. We felt very safe and cozy. The pull out sofa was used by our teenage daughter and was very comfortable. Willow has included a memory foam topper to go over sofa bed to make it so comfortable. Everything feels new and willows taste is impeccable. The cottage is squeaky clean and is stocked with everything you could need. Best place to stay in brookings !!"

Stayed a few nights","Willow has created just an absolutely gorgeous space that is a private, quiet, and peaceful. I so appreciated the attention to detail: from the essential oil infuser, to the beautiful towels and lovely scented soaps, to the faux fireplace. The mattress was super comfy. Kitchen simple, but perfectly adequate to prepare my meals (and thank you for having cooking staples available!)... and the fresh eggs were fresh and delicious. I feel very lucky to have found such a place in Brookings...and I will absolutely be back!"

Stayed over a week","Willow’s place is perfect! I stayed for a month and it felt like home. She’s really thought of everything. It was easy to cook with the new appliances, make smoothies with the magic bullet, warm and so comfortable and cozy. She’s really put a lot of thought into all the details that make this place feel like a home away from home. Down to the chickens in the yard, fresh eggs and kale from the garden! She’s very quick to respond to any inquiry, helpful, kind, and knowledgeable. She definitely goes the extra mile to ensure guests’ comfort."

The bed was comfortable (firm just how we like it), as was the couch. Willow was responsive, helpful and kind.

We had a late check in (8.30 pm after a long drive down PCH) and Willow was accommodating of it. On request she allowed us to park our vehicle inside of her property which gave us a large vote of confidence in the trust she had in us.
On entering the studio, essential oil filled the space and we felt welcome to stay at our new home for the night. The surroundings were quiet and for breakfast we enjoyed a complimentary strawberry-rhubarb cake and freshly laid eggs.
For anyone passing my Brookings we would highly recommend this place and Willow makes the experience wonderful"

It felt like we were staying at our family’s house. Rainbows all over the walls when sun shines through some stain glass appliqués in the windows. A beautiful ocean wave sound machine, was also beautiful birdsong. Lots of real birds eating from bird feeders outside the windows. Whole coffee beans with grinder, plus an abundance of everything you might need in the kitchen and bathroom.
The price is a huge bargain since so much food was generously offered.

She has thoughtfully procured everything that a traveling family would need for an overnight stop. The bed and pull-out sofa are super comfy - top-of-the-line linens and heavy comforters (the pull-out even has a comfortable mattress topper). The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need from the essential kitchen gadgets to an air fryer, coffee/tea set up, snacks to munch on and breakfast items for the next morning (including fresh eggs from their chickens)! The extra nice touches included a homemade strawberry rhubarb breakfast cake, fresh eggs, fresh flowers, a sound machine, comfy bed linens -- I could go on and on! It's a great stop if you are visiting the Redwoods or the Oregon coast. Can't wait to stay again."

We were traveling in a camper van so we wanted to make sure that was a factor. Willow created the absolute coziest guest space! She made sure she turned the heat on before we arrived and had the fireplace going when we walked in. We were staying for our elopement so we were really looking for a place that would be comfortable but reasonably priced. This is the spot! Willow knew we were getting married and left us a very sweet note. We had a great stay!

So cozy and warm, as soon as we opened the door we were greeted by the smell of cinnamon and apples….and quickly found the baked good that was responsible. This Airbnb has everything you could think of and the host is amazing and so kind. After a wet day of hiking and atving she was more than willing to do a small load of laundry for us. This small gesture meant the world to us. If you are looking for a place to stay along the PCH this is it! We can’t wait to come back!"

The attention to detail and design in this place is unmatched. I'm the former owner of a high-end vacation rental company in Mammoth Lakes, CA, and the Big Island. I can tell when an owner has gone the extra mile and Willow has certainly done that. The fridge was stocked with filtered water, OJ, milk, and other goodies from their garden and chickens. (Unfortunately, we weren't there long enough to enjoy most of that as we came up for a wedding.) The space is very well done and we'll definitely stay there again if we have the chance to venture up without our kids. :) I also enjoyed being able to walk down the road to Azalea Park for my morning walks!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Willow's apartment was lovely, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, airy, relaxing play to stay in Brookings. Perfect apartment for a couple, although there was a sofa bed if you have a larger group in mind.
One of the things we appreciated was that it felt like a very health conscious environment, without lots of heavily scented cleaning products, bath products, or air fresheners, which my wife and I really appreciate. We had a unpleasant experience at another Airbnb where the fragrance of the fabric softeners used on the bedsheets got on our clothing, luggage, and everything and the smell followed us for a week. Nothing like that at Willow's, which really allowed us to focus on other things. We enjoyed the essential oil diffuser for a light natural smell, although the fresh air from the ocean was really the best. We also enjoyed the healthy banana bread! There were also fresh eggs from her chickens available, but unfortunately we didn't have time to make them.
The apartment was so clean and new feeling that we almost felt like the first people to stay there, and we did our best to keep it that way. There was nothing we needed that wasn't readily available, and the attention to detail was really above and beyond.
We would definitely stay here again! Part of our plans had to be changed because some road maintenance was being done in Jedediah Redwood State Park, so it's likely that we will return at some point. Again, highly recommended!"

Incredible snack basket and beverages were there for our enjoyment,at no extra cost. Check in was easy and checkout had no To Do lists. This rental is private on a beautiful property. You can walk easily over to the side of the Main house on the property and get an amazing view of the ocean and beach below. There is a great parking spot,with easy load in, a very private patio with a BBQ,and patio chairs and table. The kitchen in this rental is well thought out,with everything one needs to prepare food. There is a full size fridge (YAY), and even a stacking washer dryer for longer stays. Internet was fast. I am short, so the bed was a bit tall for me, but once I climbed in (LOL) it was so comfortable.~ We will return for a longer stay next time. Thanks again.~ Karen and Drew"

Great location, private, a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, and great neighborhood to walk around. If you’re contemplating looking for another Airbnb that is “cheaper”, stop and choose this one . 100% worth the price and everything advertised in the listing was there. I usually could give some constructive criticism for an Airbnb, but I have none when it comes to this one. I had the pleasure of meeting Misty, who was kind and very attentive of my stay.

They made it much more then just a place to stay while traveling. So many thought of details of things you may need. SO many pointers and helpful info of the area, including incase of emergency page of numbers and addresses. She mentioned in the get to know us book that she had two children I think I must be close in age with them
But you can really tell by all their cute little kind things that they are grandparents. Made out 2
Night 3 day stay even better. Their names were at the top of the emergency contacts incase you needed to reach them another way. I'm pretty sure had we been in need of anything or some kind of help, they would have came and got me ❤️ she brought us out extra towels and cookies too, best home away from home ever"

Stayed a few nights","This place is unbelievable - everything imaginable exceeded expectations. It was impeccable with lots of extra touches to welcome us and make it feel more homey. The landscaping is outstanding, flowering shrubs surround the yard, and the view of the ocean and beach from the main house porch (which was ours to use) is ridiculously perfect. I can honestly say, this has to be the best airbnb we have ever stayed in, I highly, highly recommend it."

Stayed one night","I don’t think I can say anything that hasn’t been said! I think it was better than described and the host touches were amazing!
We walked in to snacks and drinks and a note and it was very welcoming. The house makes the most of the floor plan by squeezing everything in but somehow feeling very spacious!
The views from the deck were wonderful and the sunset was so peaceful. Walked the beach and it was beautiful as well.
Zero complaints and would stay here again! Kudos to Misty and Gary for being amazing hosts!!"

We had complete privacy at all times. Close to town, short walk to the beach, short drive to the redwoods. We would not hesitate to return and to recommend others to stay as well.

Misty and Gary have hospitality deep within their DNA - such gracious hosts and a lovely couple. We would definitely stay there again - the guest house had everything and anything you need to cook and stay in, and the main house desk was The Place to eat it (or get take out if you prefer not to cook). Plenty of hiking trails everywhere. 5 Stars for everything - for location, cleanliness, comfort and all the little extras (did I mention Champagne, flowers and snacks...). Book this AirBnB - you will be happy you did."

We were really late checking in and Misty was very responsive and accommodating. From the get go, you can tell immediately Misty & Gary made an extra effort to make this place feel special. Soft calming music played in the background with softly lit candles on the counters. Complimentary wine and snacks were awesome. The bed was very comfortable to sleep in. And of course can't forget the beautiful ocean views just walk away to backyard of the main house where you can relax and enjoy a fresh cup of coffee. Definitely recommend if you're visiting Brookings or on a long Oregon road trip."

We spent four days at the sea ranch and enjoyed every minute. There was snacks waiting for us and drinks waiting for us in the refrigerator, the bed was so comfortable. We would definitely come back to the sea ranch again it was a 10. If we had questions, Misty made sure that she was back to us with an answer within minutes. They are the perfect host.

Stayed a few nights","We spent 2 nights at the Sea Ranch, celebrating our 30 year anniversary. We were greeted with fresh flowers and a bottle of champagne chilling in the fridge, they also supplied snacks as well as stuff to make spaghetti. The place was spotless, private, very safe, and super cozy. All toiletries were provided and the kitchen was fully set up for preparing meals.
Gary and Misty introduced themselves and then gave us our privacy-all the while making themselves fully available should we need anything.
Sea Ranch was definitely a perfect location for home base, being near the Redwoods, the ocean, and town.
My only negative is that as far as an ocean view goes, it really didn't have one from inside the unit (just a bit from the kitchen) because the main house blocks it. In order to get a good view we had to use the main home's deck, which for us felt uncomfortable, like we were invading their space, but that's just us.
Aside from the lack of ocean views, everything else was amazing!"

My stay was very last minute and they were so kind, accommodating and responsive. The music and flickering LED fireplace was such a beautiful touch upon arrival - so calming. Check in was a breeze and the place has everything you could ever need. The hosts clearly put a lot of thought into this place - the amenities, labels, comfortable furnishings, and room design were so thoughtful. Wish I stayed longer!"

The location and views are fabu, and Sporthaven beach is walking distance and lovely. The space itself is spacious, mindfully arranged, beautifully furnished. The bed is sooooo comfortable - amazing actually, and the kitchen has everything you need, if you decide to cook instead of checking out the many local restaurants. We enjoyed sunsets on the deck, and exploring the wonders of beaches and forests. Misty and Gary are so warm, hospitable and helpful - communication is fantastic! I would stay there again in a heartbeat, and hope to do so in the future."

We got stuck hiking in the rain and did not make it to their place until afterwards, but the warm welcome of music, a fireplace, and a bottle of champagne sure helped to make amends. They are both very welcoming, communicative, and warm. Their place is close to local restaurants, but situated in a quiet community overlooking the ocean. If you have a Tesla, they will let you use their destination charger. And, like I said, the view of the ocean from their backyard is impressive."

Example.. we travel with so many “things “ that need charging. Charging cords at each side of the bed! WOW. We also liked the clean uncluttered space. It is all yours.. not shared with family excesses. ( stuffed closets and drawers) Location is serene and beautiful. Short walk to the glider and patio overlooking the ocean. We walked to dinner but might not be “walkable” for all people.
I did not pay attention to all the amenities but certainly was grateful for the washer and dryer when I had a loosing battle with some chocolate!

Stayed a few nights","Pulling onto the parking pad, I caught a glimpse of the Pacific. It was a lovely, sunny day, making our arrival perfect. Our hosts, Misty, and Gary, came outside to greet us warmly.
The guest house and patio were spotlessly clean and perfectly maintained. I must be honest; the Air B&B photos don't do justice to this lovely getaway bungalow.
We both love to cook. We found everything we needed (except the food, of course) to cook three vacation breakfasts, two take-along lunches, and two spectacular dinners. The well-equipped kitchen was divine.
The bed, or should I say the cloud of comfort, was exceptional, as were the linens. Plenty of pillows and a cozy comforter made it a place where we wanted to linger.
The property is beautifully landscaped, attracting birds of several species. My companion and I began to watch for a young female Raven that we saw each morning. She hopped around in the green lawn, looking for breakfast. She was comical.
While sipping our bubbly on the patio each evening, numerous hummingbirds came to a flowering tree no more than 5-feet from us. They buzzed and darted for a bit, then would land on a branch for a rest. It was magical.
One evening we went to the ocean-front picnic tables at the main house to watch whales feeding and playing in the shallow bay in front of the property—what a treat. At the same time, the Coast Guard was doing maneuvers. What a sunset!
We tried several restaurants in the area. There is a guide on the fridge we found particularly helpful. There is also a notebook with loads of suggestions for hiking and big tree-hugging. If you are into fishing, this seems to be a popular place for the sport.
Sea Ranch Guest House is one of the nicest Air B&Bs you will find in the area. The friendly and helpful hosts are on-property.
I highly recommend this lovely bungalow."

Stayed one night","Patrick was very welcoming and fun, and helpful to help us understand that they actually have several rooms to rent and more than one rental house on the property, so the one we thought we had paid for actually didn’t have a view of the ocean at all. The photos and descriptions are somewhat misleading (or confusing maybe just to me) , but everyone is allowed to use the main public deck which is in the photos and amazing. He quickly made it right by offering us the view room with a private deck, because it was not rented, at a higher price than we booked at, but lower than its normal price. We loved how peaceful the grounds are, and the views are stellar."

Secondly, while the home was beautiful, view was cinematic, and everything meticulously prepared.. Patrick stole the show. What a magnificently pleasant individual. I am from the south and southern hospitality is a given - not easy to “wow” me in that regard. But Patrick & Barbara were SO amiable, personable and welcoming!
It was so difficult to leave. Would recommend to any and all, and if ever I find myself back up in the PNW, I’ll definitely seek them out!"

Patrick greeted us when we arrived and texted us beforehand leaving crystal clear instructions about how to find the property. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and well organized. They have everything you could possibly need - travel bags (tooth paste, floss, shaving cream etc), cooking utensils (pots, pans, silverware) and clean towels/sheets. The bed was so comfortable and my partner and I fell asleep to the sound of the ocean crashing outside. The view of the Pacific is one of the best in Oregon and the property is beautifully maintained. Thank you Patrick for your kindness and positivity! It was infectious after a long day of driving! I can't wait to come back. 10/10 - 5 stars. STAY HERE!"

Barbara and Patrick were wonderful hosts and responded quickly to any correspondence. Patrick gave us a tour of the property and suite and was friendly, welcoming and professional. Check-in was easy and instructions provided for both parking and the suite. Lots of great information provided on local amenities and touristy things to do. Beautiful gardens and the fountain in front of the suite provided a gentle ""white noise"" when we had the windows open.

I think I saw orcas for the first time on the Oregon coast!
There were the basics to cook minimally. We ended up just using the toaster which was great to have. Appreciated the organic offerings and different kinds of good sweeteners for coffee.
Thoughtful considerations added for items forgotten (or lost in my case) that were available to have. Nice book selection. Excellent location! Didn’t notice road sounds."

Stayed one night","My wife and I had a short but peaceful stay at Patrick and Barbara's Coastal Cliff's. Patrick greeted us at the gate exuding warm hospitality in everway! The room was very comfortable and the view of the Pacific Ocean was spectacular!
The added amenities - from toiletries, snacks, slippers and robes (and so much more) were a comforting touch and very appreciated.
This is a special place. We will be staying here again!

Stayed a few nights","We can't say enough good things about our stay at Patrick and Barbara's B&B! They were so friendly and helpful, and there were so many extra little touches. The granola, juice, cheese, snacks, coffee...not to mention the sparkling cider they left for our anniversary. The mini fridge freezer is also big enough for a bag of ice. The bed was comfortable, the shower was great, and we had everything we needed, including extra toiletries, beach chairs, umbrellas (which we thankfully didn't need), a tray for dirty shoes near the front door, and plenty of privacy. The ocean views are incredible, the flowers around the property are gorgeous, and the location is perfect for a quick drive to grab something to eat, shop, run to the grocery store, etc. We took their advice and ordered the Golden Cashew Chicken at Kuhn Thai. Yum! We spent three nights, which wasn't enough, and would definitely stay there again!"

Their prompt and friendly communication ensured a seamless booking process, and they were always available to answer any questions I had. Their warm hospitality and attention to detail truly made a difference in my overall experience.
The location of this Airbnb was another standout feature with a beautiful view of Oregon Coast. I really enjoyed watching sunset on sitting on their patio.
Inside my private suite, everything was nice and clean. The listing accurately portrayed the space.
Overall, I would highly recommended this place!! I will definitely be returning to this incredible Airbnb in the future.
Thank you Barbara & Patrick!"

On par with - if not exceeding - a luxury hotel for less than half the price, with all the added personalization, privacy, and space of an AirBnB! We stayed here for a few days on our honeymoon and the hosts went above and beyond to make our stay relaxing and special!! The pictures really don't do the views justice. You can park right outside the unit's front door, making unloading/loading super convenient. Kitchenette was well stocked with breakfast foods, coffee, and essentials. Incredibly comfortable space and you can tell the hosts really love having guests stay here! Words hardly do it justice and pictures barely come close - if you are considering a stay here, BOOK IT! You won't regret it ❤️ We will be back!"

It feels like you’re staying with an old friend because of all of the intimate touches. The location is amazing, the views alone are worthy of a 5 star review. Patrick greeted us when we arrived (and they were very accommodating of a late arrival) Brookings is gorgeous and we took a recommended hike which was beyond anything I expected.

Barbara shared beautiful ideas about hiking for us and local attractions to see in the area. She thought of every detail that would make our stay comfortable and restful. I have stayed at many Airbnb locations and have never had any hosts provide this many additional touches to make me feel at home. From bathrobes and slippers, to pantry essentials, toiletries, games and so much more, there was nothing I needed to stress over. This was such a relaxing and rejuvenating retreat for us and we will be back as often as we can. We are Barbara and Patrick customers for life!
Thank you so much for having us!"

Barbara and Patrick really thought of everything, and they even put together binders with information about local places to eat and activities to do. They were so kind and welcoming, and their thoughtfulness made us feel right at home.
The view of the beach from the deck was unbelievable. We watched the sunset from there both nights of our stay, and I couldn't imagine a better spot to be. That being said, we were also only a few minutes away from a really great public beach, as well as the rest of the town, so we were never short on things to do or places to go.

But the part that impressed us the most was how many “above and beyond” thoughtful and generous items were supplied that made our trip so great!

Patrick was very nice and made sure our stay was comfortable and perfect! There is no other place in Brookings that can top this!
Don't pass up hiking the Boy Scout Tree Trail in the Jedidiah Smith State Park in Crescent City, and also visit Secret Beach north of Brookings."

Views from the patio that felt like a destination of their own. We loved being able to sit and read and look out over the ocean. Patrick and Barbara were also very friendly, welcoming, and hospitable, even giving us a bottle of wine when they learned it was our honey moon. We would recommend this place to anyone going to Brookings and would love one day to return!"

Accommodations were very nice and comfortable. It’s clear Barbara and Patrick have invested significant effort to make things easy for guests.
Patrick was our host and went above and beyond, both reacting and anticipating our needs, while also giving us space.
Overall an excellent stay, experience, would highly recommend !"

Stayed a few nights","Going to Brookings? There is no more grand and beautiful place than Patrick & Barbara's Coastal Cliffs. Their well cared for grounds gave one chills every time you drove through the gates. The cliff to breakers views are the best you can find in Brookings. Their close to town location made each trip short and easy. Suite A was well provisioned, fresh and clean.
If you want to kick back, watch the waves break and imagine you're staying in a high end resort, this is the place."

Stayed a few nights",Views were beautiful and it was fun going down to the beach. It's a workout getting up that staircase! Lots of places to rest and enjoy unobstructed views of the ocean there. Host was very friendly. The main downside was the actual room/living space. It was a clean mishmash of colors and styles but pretty musty/old smelling and the furniture was very uncomfortable. There were a lot of board games to play but no TV to watch a movie. For nights after a long day at the beach/forest that would've been awesome. Not everyone wants that I'm sure but we ended up watching on my tiny computer. We appreciated the space but some improved furniture would've made a world of difference.

Stayed a few nights","WOW! Best AirBnB ever!!! My fiance and I stayed here for two nights and we had an amazing time.
Home: Very cozy. The bed's comforter and pillows were extremely comfy. The bathroom (specifically the shower and toilet) were all really clean. Toiletries were available. The kitchenette was small but adequate for us. We only used the fridge and toaster to eat the bagels they provided. There were also plenty of breakfast foods and snacks provided. We couldn't hear the voices or sounds of the other renters on the other side of us, but we did hear things like doors opening. No big deal. It's more than enough space for two people (a couple, ideally), but might feel a little snug with 3 or more people.
Balcony/Beach: Exactly what you see in pictures. Maybe even better. I know it's all over this listing but it bears repeating: PRIVATE BEACH ACCESS! It is admittedly not the most accessible though- it takes a lot of stairs and some are very steep. The railings also seem easy to get splinters on. I would be cautious of young children and people with any mobility issues using these stairs.
Hosts: Patrick met with us when we first arrived and showed us around. We ran into him a handful of times (mostly because we actually stayed around the home for like... most of the trip lol. rare on a vacation for us personally, but the private beach was better than any of the public ones!) and had some friendly chats. Super welcoming and kind!"

Not only is the location more than ideal (close to Samuel Boardman, Pistol River, Meyers Creek Beach, etc) they were such amazing hosts, very welcoming and kind. Their private beach was breathtaking, (unheard of with most Airbnb’s) and had I had more time there, I would’ve woken up each morning and headed straight over there to watch the sunrise/eat breakfast. I’d recommend this place for sure! x"

The home record player was a nice touch. I forgot to bring my own LPs, however.

They also provided great recommendations for things to see/do and places to eat in their guidebook! Definite attention to detail and amenities that one might need or enjoy while away from home. The home is just a short 5 minute drive from stores and restaurants. Great beaches and redwood hikes close by! 10/10 would recommend for anyone to stay here! They were exceptional hosts, and we will plan to stay there again in the future."

Every amenity is very high quality. I had the chance to meet Linda in crossing and I can tell you she’s a beautiful person just from the 5 mins we got to speak. Do not hesitate to stay here. Definitely a gem on the beautiful Oregon Coast.

We were very excited to find a variety of teas and coffees, along with a couple of other snacks. Linda was so friendly and very responsive. She always made sure the lanterns were on when we were coming back in at night, but we found the walk from the car to the cabin to be just fine without them. I would definitely recommend to give this place a visit if you’re coming to Brookings."

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is tucked away in a private, peaceful spot on the property facing the morning sun, which we found to be a nice way to wake-up each morning. The sunlight came in through a pretty wood line, so it wasn’t too harsh. At night, stars were beautifully visible, and Mrs. Linda was very gracious to turn on lanterns for our use to walk to the cabin with each night. She stocked the cabin with bottled water, snack bars, and some fresh fruits prior to our visit. She really goes the extra mile for her guests. The cabin is only a few minutes drive from the Samuel Boardman Scenic Corridor with various (gorgeous) hikes/viewpoints, which we thought was a huge plus. It’s also a short 10-15 min drive to town if you want to enjoy shopping or the harbor areas of town."

Linda’s place is even more stunning in person. The cabin is beautiful with all the modern amenities. The decor is wonderful. Our favorite part was waking up to the sunrising through the trees & enjoying a cup of tea on the deck.
Every detail is tended to from a great coffee selection, bottled waters & we even had a bowl of fresh fruit. This cabin has everything you need for a romantic getaway.
We had the opportunity to meet Linda & she was absolutely lovely. We thanked her for the wonderful accommodations & allowing us to do our wedding pictures at the cabin. We can’t wait to share them with her!
It was sad leaving after our 5 day stay, however look forward to returning next year to celebrate our 1 year anniversary & make more amazing memories!
Thank you again Linda 🤍"

The cabin was done to such a high standard, and the outside decking facing the trees was so peaceful. We spent our time exploring the gorgeous Samual H. Boardman corridor which is literally on the doorstep of the cabin. It was some of the most beautiful scenery we have ever seen. We picked up takeaway from pacific sushi and grill and sprezzatura, and went to breakfast at blue water cafe and lounge, all of which were fantastic, we just wish we could have tried more places. Linda was an incredible host and and just made our stay perfect. We couldn’t recommend this place enough and just wish we could have stayed longer."

The cabin itself is peaceful and very private, since its front entrance faces away from the main house and towards the forest, which is very pretty with swirling fog and dew in the mornings. People sensitive to light may want to bring a sleep mask because the light leaks in through the windows above the bed. The little gas stove kept the place cozy and the cabin was well kept and immaculately clean."

Linda was very gracious at being flexible with the check-in time, as we planned to make the drive quicker than expected. We are very picky about mattresses and this bed (and bedding!) was just so comfortable. The location of this cabin, the stunning view, cleanliness, cozy and homey atmosphere, and so much more are things I would give more than 5 stars on. Perfect “off-grid” feeling with all of the simple luxuries, it was exactly the retreat we needed for our anniversary vacation. This is a place that made us feel tucked away in the woods and right at home as soon as we walked in. Huge thanks to Linda for hosting such a lovely home and experience."

Stayed one night","There are not enough words to describe how incredibly beautiful this space was! It is so nicely done down to the smallest details. Set back from the larger main house, the cabin has a very private, cozy and even romantic feel to it. When you first walk up it seems somewhat nondescript, as it is just the back of the cabin showing from the outside, but as you walk down to the wrap around porch you realize this place is an absolute gem. The main windows and sitting porch are elevated into the woods, raised up on pillars, giving you the most gorgeous wooded view. The space is decorated so beautifully, and has a classy, clean, tastefully designed elevated cabin feel. The walk in stone shower was gorgeous and the kitchenette had everything we needed. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!!"

The cabin is stunning, very clean, quiet & private, we felt right at home. There were tons of little extras, we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The cabin is a short 10-minute drive from Brookings and is right along the Samuel H. Boardman Scenic Corridor, which were the two places we spent most of our time, so it was perfect. We would love to stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a beautiful & peaceful weekend away."

The cabin is at the very end of a small neighborhood but sits with the windows facing the woods so it feels super secluded once you’re inside. There are gorgeous big bay windows looking out to the woods. It was too cold to sit on the porch during our stay, but the windows made it feel like you could get almost the same experience from the inside. The cabin has a beautiful interior with a combo of rustic and modern. Our host was friendly and great with communication. Would highly recommend this stay!!"

Linda was as sweet as can be, and even checked in on me a few times to ensure I was doing ok and ask if I needed anything (I had just finished a cross country drive from ME to OR for work and was exhausted upon arrival).
Brookings has some great food options, and is a pretty cool little town!"

Luke has provided everything you need and a few things you may have forgotten. There's condiments, spices, cooking oils and honey as well as personal care items. With two full sets of towels in the bathroom and extra TP you won't stress about a shortage of either. It almost goes without saying that the unit was very clean. The bed was comfortable so I enjoyed a good night's sleep. I hope to stay here again."

Stayed one night","When I texted Luke about difficulties finding the remote to control the heat on this very cold night, Luke responded quickly to let me know that it’s kept on the wall near the kitchen and opposite the bed. And when I had a problem locking the door when going out to dinner, he again replied quickly that I should enter the code and turn the deadbolt to the left while pulling the door handle towards me.
A short sheet of instructions might save him from responding to texts like like mine."

Stayed one night",We had a great stay. It was dark when we arrived but the front porch light was on. The inside was cold and dark. The lights were easy to find but it was hard to figure out the heater. We finally found the remote to turn on the heater but there were no directions on how to use it. We messaged Luke and he was quick to respond. We tried the back and forth messages because we were only getting cold air in the winter. He offered to come over to help when we finally said yes please. He was right over and when at first we couldn’t figure out the heat he offered to bring over another heat source. He was finally able to figure out how the wall heater worked and with in a little it was nice and toasty. We had a great night sleep and my husband said the bed was the most comfortable he had ever slept in. We took the advice in the book of places to see the next day and loved it. Thanks for all your help. We would stay here again the next time we are in Brookings. Luke is a great host.

The studio was warm and cozy, and supplies were provided for our needs. I could have used a little more counter space for food preparation. We liked the heater, and at night we prefer to sleep cooler. We appreciated the extra blanket Luke brought us when we needed one. We had a nice visit.
The highlight of our stay was seeing gray whales as they migrated south. We watched them for two hours at the upper Harris Beach parking lot. At Luke's suggestion, we then explored Indian Sands. He was right, it was steep getting there! And it was well worth it. We spent another two hours on that adventure. The crashing waves were a perfect ending to our journey.
All in all, a positive experience."

For kayaking, we called the number on the Riverside Market flyer who gave us great advice on where to kayak that day since the water was low.
For a longer stay, I would have definitely used the washer/dryer, the stove/oven, cooking utensils, pots/pans, and prep bowls. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Our Google Map led us incorrectly to a street corner when we put in Luke’s address, so that combined with Luke being hard to reach, and not as communicative, made for a nerve-wracking check-in. I have communicated with Airbnb and Luke that more information about his place’s location and more responsive communication would’ve resolved this issue, as we were out-of-state visitors and had never been to the Oregonian coast. Luke apologized kindly and did become more responsive after check-in, which we appreciated.
After we located his place, we had a comfortable stay. It is spacious (minus the bathroom, small sink and small area), and had many great amenities, including a washer and dryer. The Oregonian coast is beautiful so we will definitely make a return trip!"

Stayed one night","Nice place, very comfortable. Having laundry facilities (with supplied detergent) was GREAT for what was the half way point of our trip. Location is decent, in a residential area near a park and walkable to the main business district of Brookings. Bed was great, maybe the most comfortable we slept in during our vacation (we stayed at 7 different places).
Only one complaint, the bathroom wasn't great. It was mostly ok, but the sink was comically small. Like it was so small it was hard to brush your teeth or wash your face small. I've never seen a sink that small. Otherwise this place was a very comfortable, clean place to spend a night and I would return if in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic location! Walking distance to downtown and Azalea Park. A sweet and cozy place big enough for short or longer term stays. Loved the back patio with ambient lighting and fire pit. Great beach/surfer decor, light and airy, a comfy bed and fully stocked kitchen. Luke is super responsive and a great host! We highly recommend this little gem."

Stayed over a week","Excellent stay! Truly the best on the coast. Brookings is a beautiful little city with all the amenities of a larger one (movie theater, bars, coffee shops) but with a small population and large amount of natural beauty. This apartment was well equipped for my girlfriend and I to live in for 5 weeks, working remotely from laptops. The WiFi was strong throughout the apartment, allowing one to work from the solid wood desk while the other worked from the bar. Air conditioner was strong everywhere, and all appliances were new. The bedroom closet has all the beach amenities needed, like towels, buckets, kites. The tv works great, and was hooked up to all streaming platforms. The backyard had comfortable chairs and lights for lounging. There was ample private parking space, enough for multiple vehicles. The location is also perfect! It’s a 2 minute bike ride to the main strip of Brookings, and about 8 minutes to the quays or Chetco point. The host was very responsive and present for any requests we had, which were seldom due to the perfect place we arrived to. It was a great value for the money, and I’m surprised I was able to book for a month. My only regret is that I didn’t nab it for the rest of the remote-working summer. My goal is now to find a house or apartment in Brookings"
