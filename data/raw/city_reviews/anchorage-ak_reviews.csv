Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed for a few nights at Hennie and John’s. We had a great time! The place was as described and depicted on the profile and they were quick to reply to any questions/messages we had. It was very clean and organized. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and the close access to the airport, town, and lake hood (for wildlife viewing). We had a moose walk through the yard one afternoon right outside our window. Not a far drive to hiking trails in the mountains! Easy check in and check out."

Stayed a few nights","We had a perfect stay at Hennie and John's place. It is very close to the airport, stores, and restaurants. It was very very clean which is most important to us. The kitchen is well stocked. The bed is very comfortable. Lots of linens are provided. There is a possibility that the number of narrower stairs going down to the door to the Airbnb might be a problem for some people."

I slept deeply, had plenty of privacy and easy access for walks around the lake multiple times during my stay. The kitchen was well equipped and there was plenty of room to spread out in the living room and dining area. Also ample parking space and lush surrounding woodlands. John and Hennie were warm and friendly, with wide smiles and gracious generosity. I would happily stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Exactly what we were looking for! It was right near the float plane airport (lake), which you can walk around for an evening stroll. There were a few restaurants on the water as well, if watching the planes is your thing - plus the food was great!
Just a short drive downtown if that is more what you're coming for.
Henri was SUPER friendly, even offering for us to try some home cooking when he saw us come in one evening.
I would definitely recommend!!"

The home was very and we had everything we needed for some light cooking. For our hike, we were able to borrow a can of bug spray and bear spray which luckily we didn’t need, but was nice to have. We even saw a moose at Kincaid park, about a 10 min drive away. Hennie was very responsive and accommodating. They were kind enough to let us check in early too which was great after a long flight."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at John & Hennie's place was a dream come true. They had everything one could possibly want in a giant freezer like AK. LOL. They had everything anyone could ask for when traveling, full stop. Tons of towels, tea, coffee, you name it. They even had Ziplocs and complimentary snacks. My best friend and I stayed here about a week and it was cozy and wonderful and perfect.
I very much appreciated the decor, the warmth of the bed, and as a reader, the mini library. It made me want to stay in haha.
We also had the opportunity to meet John and Hennie, and they were very kind. Thank you for accommodating our requests. God bless you both. Stay warm!"

We were also very pleased to find out it was only a few minutes from the airport (after arriving from out of state at around 1am). Convenient location, only a few minutes from downtown, other tourist spots, restaurants, and stores. The hosts were kind enough to provide some additional amenities like soaps and snacks. If we ever make it back to Anchorage we’d absolutely stay here again."

The house was comfortable and well stocked-everything we needed and then some. We especially loved how much there was of everything-we didn’t have to worry about running out of towels or toilet paper or anything so we could spend our time exploring instead of making Wal Mart runs. :)
The house had a lot of fun and unique decor which we appreciated!
Thanks for being a great host! We would definitely come back."

The apartment situated in a quiet residential neighborhood was so clean, comfortable and well appointed with all the comforts you need while traveling plus lots of little extras. The bedroom was a good size, plenty of storage and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom had a nice shower with great water pressure. There were plenty of towels and space to spread out your toiletries. The kitchen had absolutely everything that I normally would want in my kitchen and then some extras. It is so nice that they had all the essential cooking tools. There is plenty of space easily for 2-3 adults since there is a couch also. There was even a small library of various reading material at your disposal. Definately plenty of TV streaming services to choose from. Biggest bonus, owners live right upstairs and are so gracious and helpful. Downtown Anchorage is 10-15 minutes where you can fund all kinds of great food. Anyone would be lucky to stay here."

It’s very cozy with everything you’ll need to prepare your own meals, or dine out at the many different restaurants close by. It’s centrally located, or at least for us it ended up that way. It’s close to beautiful parks and a lake. It’s also close to the airport. We stayed from New Years Eve 2021 and brought in the New Year surrounded by snow and beautiful mountains. One of the days we drove to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, it’s about 50 miles and a breathtaking drive. It’s hard to put into words the beauty that is Anchorage AK."

The living room is well laid out, and the kitchen is complete. The bathroom is functional and you are staying in one of the historic buildings in Anchorage!
I will stay again."

Stayed one night","Ok, so can Stephanie adopt us?!?!
This BnB looks exactly like the photos-- she made us COOKIES (that were DELICIOUS!) and wrote a personalized thank-you card for me & my boo that was waiting for us!
I had forgotten the code to the lockbox to close it, and a neighbor who was entering the building kindly stopped us from entering (and we were also kind and showed her the instructions and offered ID) which made me feel safe. She wasn't mad at us being BNB guests, and it was refreshing to just know that the neighbors were a safe and kind bunch.
The sleeping lady was literally right outside the window and there were so many walkable spots. The bedding and blankets and towels smelled fresh and amazing.
The building is an older building, but perfect. I didn't hear neighbors and honestly it felt even more cozy being a vintage building.
I ended up taking a bath and the water was SO clear and aqua blue!
100/100 I'd reccomend."

There were many food and drink options within walking distance (my favorite were 49th State and F St) as well as some shops. Having the parking spot ended up being a great perk and alleviated the stress of finding downtown parking.
The place itself was spotless and modern. I really enjoyed the view of the water right from the dining table.
Stephenie was communicative and replied quickly to all my questions. I highly recommend this Airbnb and would absolutely stay here again."

The living room had cushy couches and a tv. I loved that it was on the 3rd floor and you could open the blinds from top or bottom to let light in. We could see all the way to the inlet. It had all the amenities we needed for a night stay and we felt right at home. My daughter and I walked to 49th State Brewing for dinner right down the road and felt safe. It was delicious. Stephenie was a gracious host and gave us several different recommendations. What an amazing place for those who want to get a true north experience in downtown Anchorage. It’s located conveniently close to all the best the city has to offer. If we had been staying longer, the kitchen looked like it was stocked for everything you need to cook and a cute little desk that would be perfect to do work at. We will definitely book this place again."

The neighborhood trails were perfect for being able to walk my friends dog & let my son truly get his ya ya’s out As we were leaving, he was excited to see from inside the plane where we had walked to—trails near the road & a huge, clean dog park that is a bog & has a lake! We admired Jordan’s style inside, the unobtrusive framing on the TV, the soft afghans, beautiful kitchenware, and every choice of wood-framed art. It was perfect for our spring/summer stay with my elderly mother and young son."

The basement feel was cozy but a little musty smelling, so we used a lot of Febreeze. The place is so many has cute, Alaskan things to look at, we enjoyed it all. The creaking of the ceiling/floorboards upstairs was quite annoying, and you can hear everything that goes on upstairs, so if you are looking for a quiet weekend getaway, this may not be what you are looking for. Lots of games and books and the movie room with the projector screen was a lot of fun!"

Stayed one night","We appreciated the early check in greatly as we arrived to Anchorage from Girdwood earlier than expected with weary eyes. The path to the back was icy and needed gravel and sanding, but they responded swiftly about where the gravel was for myself to apply as they were away.
Probably wouldn’t recommend this spot for older folks, hard to get the luggage down the path with solid footing but we managed. It was a beautifully creative artistic space, well designed for youthful and carefree travelers. If you require the v basics, it’s for you. The beds are fairly out of date and very sinking soft (I could suggest an update), but super clean new linens.
Unfortunately late night overhead foot traffic & chatter from 2am-5am left us sleepless BUT Gemma and Huey made it right with a full refund. We are thankful to them as our hosts & would recommend this for floaty young travelers who enjoy a unique funky hobbit hole to call their own for a weekend. Can’t beat the price for a hot tub included!"

Drove to Matanuska Glacier and out to Girdwood from this place with no issues (only noting this bc coming to AK for the first time I was a little worried but it was FINE!!) Many restaurants within an extremy short drive. I bought bearspray to take with me everywhere but was also happy to see they provided a can for guests.

They also had a chicken coop in their back yard and welcomed guests to pet/feed them and take some eggs! We had those eggs for breakfast. It was a really cool experience. Our favorite chicken is called “Sexy” who loves chicken snacks haha.
Overall, Everything was thought out meticulously. Their movie theater, reading room, rock collection, decor… basically everything was super cool.
We only stayed 1 night and wish we stayed for longer!"

Whether it's the books room with all the info about Alaska or the theater room with projector and lots of movies to choose from, it feels like you are in a studio. We had a really good time there.
Both Gemma and Huey are friendly hosts. They recommended several local activities and things to do (which was helpful because we didn't plan the trip much)."

My daughter loved the movie room and the chickens, and we got to introduce her to the dubious magic of VHS. All the books and Alaska history items were also cool, though I have to take exception to the decision to organize the books by color, though that's a personal preference. Quiet neighborhood, and if we had more time we would have loved to canoe the lake, but that leaves us something for next time!"

And I loved being able to give my food scraps to the chickens and reduce landfill waste. PLEASE be kind to this historical space, it has such a lovely feel and the hosts are kind and open. Be sure to read the description about sound levels and water availability on site. None are an issue as long as you are prepared. They also had some wreckage from a deck collapse near the entrance so be aware of your surroundings. Anchorage got so much snow this year so it isn’t surprising. I’m sure they will have it fixed up once the snow melts! All and all, great stay, wonderful hosts."

The hosts were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and I immediately felt right at home. They were always available to answer any questions and offer recommendations on things to do in the area. They truly went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.
And let's not forget about the hot tub! It was the perfect way to unwind after a long day of exploring. My significant other and I loved soaking in the hot tub under the stars.
This is an superb value for Alaska with hosts that truly care about the place. I hope to come back again soon."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, an amazing place to stay. It was absolutely gorgeous, no neighbors close by or any crowding, and just a spectacular view. There were a few things that we think would help others to know, though.
The water pressure for the shower is just awful. The heat is fine, but it's basically a trickle. You can still shower, but be ready to bundle up immediately afterward!
The size is cozier than we first thought. It ended up being great for a couple, but I can't imagine actually fitting 3-4 people in here unless you're all very close (2 on a bed, 1 on the couch, 1 on an inflatable mattress).
The stairs are incredibly steep due to the size of the cabin (not enough room to make them a gradual slope). I'd consider them more of a ladder than stairs. If you have mobility issues, it may be difficult to get up and downstairs (especially to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night).
Overall, a great stay. There was coffee, cooking supplies, and great heat. Honestly, an amazing place!"

Stayed about a week","A great place to stay in Anchorage! This A-frame cabin is a guest house on the owner's hillside property, tucked away from the well-kept neighorhood roads in trees and foliage. Charming and comfortable; close enough to downtown to go ""out"" to dinner, but with a secluded, woodsy feel that made it relaxing to stay home and eat dinner on the porch, enjoying fresh seafood and watching the sunset. We saw a moose out and about in the neighborhood! The loft sleeping area was spacious and the bed was great, but note that the steps to it are widely spaced -- almost like climbing a ladder -- so it won't work for everybody. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything was lovely! The cabin was extremely well-appointed, and went beyond my expectations for having everything we needed to cook meals, including quality appliances and cookware.
There were plenty of extra supplies available. Towels, bedding and bed were superbly clean and comfortable!
In fact, everything was clean and comfortable!
The stairs are not for the faint of heart...if you are elderly or have knee problems, you may want to consider sleeping downstairs on the futon or choosing a different location, but it worked just fine for us!
There were fans and heaters available for additional comfort and white noise at night.
The laundry machines worked well and detergent was even supplied.
I loved the fact there is no tv and we enjoyed perusing the vast collection of books and had some fun playing a little Trivial Pursuit as well ;-)
This was truly a darling little cabin in a nice, safe neighborhood! The view of the city and ocean from the upstairs window was delightful and we saw moose in the neighborhood on our way in...what a treat!
Thanks to our gracious, friendly, and helpful host, Rebecca! You won't regret staying here!!"

Definitely recommending this place for anyone who wants to stay in a quiet and private place that is surrounded by trees but within a 15 min drive of the downtown Anchorage. We even saw a moose in our driveway!"

The cabin has the promised excellent downhill (which are very hard to find in Anchorage), the photos really don't do it justice. There are also windows on all the other walls, looking out at the birch and evergreens around the cabin. It was dead quiet up there during our whole stay which was a pleasant surprise. Heat is controlled by a thermostat and the cabin was nice and toasty when we were there in late October."

Stayed a few nights","For anyone who can’t stand staying in a hotel or motel and wants to be a little off the beaten path where it is quiet with incredible views of the anchorage sound with the 14,000 foot mountains beyond and the smazing sunsets this is a place for you we loved the fact that we could hike right from her door less than a mile away. Aside from hiking it was an easy 10 minute ride to downtown Anchorage where there is good food and drink the biggest surprise that we had no idea which ended being a bucket moment, was visiting the anchorage zoo less than five minutes away from the cabin What made it so special iwas the exhibit with snow leopards. Although our paths did not cross I always felt secure that Rebecca would always be there if we needed anything so I am giving this place five stars plus"

Ladder to loft may be difficult for those with limited mobility but there is a hide-a-bed downstairs. Highly recommended.

Her place is about 20-25 minutes from downtown Anchorage, so you can go into the city during the day and come back to peace and tranquillity in the evening. The deck has a great view and was perfect for coffee and a good book in the morning. I highly recommend her cabin!!"

We took day trips to Seward and Talkeetna and the cabin was perfectly located to make those trips super easy. The drive from the cabin to downtown Anchorage was very convenient as well. If we return to Anchorage I would book this cabin with Rebecca in a heartbeat."

The the rise between the ladder steps (to the bedroom loft with a comfy king bed) is higher than normal and the ladder is built so that going up or down, your back is quite close to the wall. This is fine if you're short (I'm 5'3"") but my significant other is 6'4"" and it was a bit tricky for him. The bathroom is very spacious and the cabin is well-stocked. We didn't meet Rebecca but via email and text she gave excellent directions to the cabin and was very accommodating."

The cabin is quiet, stocked with a gas heating stove (works very well to keep it cozy), a full bathroom (bigger in person), washer and dryer, upstairs loft, and more.. We had a wonderful time and Rebecca's service was outstanding. We made our breakfast every morning with the provided stove and mini-fridge (bring your own groceries) and watched the city-view through the window. At night, we drove downtown (10-15 minutes) for dinner and entertainment. I can hardly complain about anything. Any concerns or problems were resolved in a professional and timely manner.. Great place. I'd recommend to any couple or single travelers."

Older people take note that the ladder to the loft is a little difficult to navigate. Also, this cabin is adjacent to a residence and in a neighborhood rather than isolated in the mountains. That said, we didn't see a single person while we were there. There is a fun covered porch in the front that has a nice view of Anchorage."

Every little detail has been thought of and is beautifully appointed. The apartment was recently remodelled so everything is brand-new, clean, perfectly placed. The bed was super comfortable! Location is fantastic for what I was after and I understand it’s close to all the major hospitals as well. Quiet neighbourhood, never heard any of the people in other units. Shared laundry downstairs was a very welcome convenience for me. Cute little veranda where you can see the mountains and have a wine, I felt very safe here as a solo woman traveller. Ample parking and lots of brochures and tourist information downstairs. Kayla is a very responsive host and very helpful, welcoming and caring even before I arrives. Highly recommend!!

It was just fantastic. The bed was amazing I want one. It was clean and privately located but close to everything. The backyard had a fireplace and wood but it was crummy weather so we didn't get to use the fire. There was a four person outdoor set to relax and watch the people on the trail below us. Real Flowers everywhere. Just beautiful! We were having trouble with cable so they came over and we visited with them for a while and could have talked to them forever. The cable company was having the problems. And the next day she brought me flowers for the inconvience. Didn't want to leave there. So much to do in Anchorage. We love Alaska and we love Portside Hideaway, We will be back... Thank you Bridget and John"

Even though the tracks run behind the house, we couldn't hear the train inside and it never disrupted our sleep.
Bridget was a wonderful host. She provided lots of goodies for breakfast and other cooking supplies. She also leant us one of her cans of bear spray to take with us up to Denali. Fortunately, we didn't need to use it and brought it back for others. Hope to return someday!"

I really appreciated all of the amenities that the host provided, including things even like shaving cream and breakfast items in the kitchen which other hosts never provide. It was a great property with a great view outside. The host was so communicative all the time. I loved it."

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This place is too notch ! It’s gorgeous, cute and quaint, the pictures don’t do it justice. Comfy large king bed, and very spacious.
It has everything you can think of, snacks (free of charge ), condiments , bug spray, toiletries , etc pretty much anything you might have forgotten, I have never such a stocked air bnb !
Location is perfect, it’s right on the water with cute backyard , but also at same time only two blocks from the Main Street and restaurants , we walked everywhere.
And finally, the owner is super helpful and proactive, check in and out was so smooth, it was really wonderful stay.
This is by far the best air b nb I have stayed at, don’t hesitate to book!"

The fridge was well stocked and everything was as we expected. A great location for walking around Anchorage. Many great restaurants within a 20 minute walk. We were there a week and didn't rent a car. Walked or used Uber. Will definitely stay there again when visiting Anchorage, highly recommend to anyone visiting Anchorage. The Alaskan Railroad Depot is only a 10 minute walk with connections to Whittier, Seward, Denali and other locations in Alaska. There were also 2 nice bikes available to use. Would give 7 stars if I could."

Beautifully eclectic, amazing views, comfortable furniture, extremely well stocked kitchen, washer and dryer - and so very walkable to just about anything in Anchorage. It overlooks the rail yard and the first night we heard trains but after that, we didn't hear than anymore. She was kind enough to put out earplugs though, which we didn't have to use! The water views are wonderful and you can even see the Denali Summit on a clear day, which we had each day! I would definitely stay at this location again when I am fortunate enough to return to Anchorage!"

It has to be one of my top 3 favorite Airbnbs. The train in the distance doing the slow Cha Cha of going back and forth to change tracks is a treat for us train lovers. The place was so perfect, I didn’t want to leave! There were snacks throughout the house and the fireplace was heavenly for relaxing after a long day.

We were greeted with a bottle of wine, beer and other drinks in the fridge, fresh coffee beans and a grinder, and lots of yummy snacks and breakfast items. Bridget was very responsive when we had a question. And, as far as value, added over the week we stayed, this BnB saved us a huge chunk of money over the hotels we considered. We definitely want to come back in the summer time and stay here again!"

You could get anywhere in town in a 15 minute walk, even with all the snow slowing us down. It was quiet and the view of the bay was gorgeous. It is 100% worth the price and I can’t wait to stay again!"

Stayed over a week","I can't say enough good things about this cottage and the host! I had a two week work trip to Anchorage in December and wanted a quiet place where I could work, prepare my own meals, and rest. For all those things, this place was perfect. Additionally, it has great access to downtown restaurants and venues. But when you're ready to wind down, it still feels private.
While I was there, Anchorage had three major snowstorms and overall about 5 feet of snow fell. The hosts were great to reach out and check to see that snow removal had occurred (it had) and that I was alright.
Additionally, during my stay the local internet provider had some equipment malfunction. Since the hosts knew that I was there for work, they went out of their way to make sure the problem got resolved in a timely manner. Super helpful and responsive!
This cottage will be my first choice for my next trip to Anchorage!"

It’s a two minute walk to the start of the Coastal Trail. It’s a five minute (or less) walk to great eateries including 49th State Brewing and Glacier Brewhouse, both of which had some of the best food we ate all weekend.
The hosts are fantastic. They provided extra pillows to ensure we’d be comfortable and accommodated a late checkout for no extra charge. Plus, the cottage itself is very well equipped with snacks, chilled drinks, a fully usable kitchen, laundry, bikes—really everything you could possibly want while staying in a home away from home.

Very comfy bed. All the amenities you could ask for, plus a few Alaskan necessities like bear spray and bug spray. And Bridget provides so many lovely touches and surprises. So communicative too! It’s the rare property that is actually better than listed. We will 100% stay here next time we are in town."

The bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains definitely came in handy. Bridget is also an incredible host, providing great snacks, accommodations, and communications. Watching the 11pm sunset from the deck was a great bonus! Given how late the sun is out in the summer, I’d fully recommend booking here over a hotel."

I hope to be able to come back when the yard isn’t under 3 feet of snow so I can sit out in the yard and enjoy the amazing view! I loved the trains and they weren’t loud enough to be disruptive. The planes and jets nearby made for really fun viewing. The proximity to the Coastal Trail couldn’t be easier. My tip, rent electric fat tire bike with studded tires from Downtown Bicycle Rentals and take the trail, such a great experience!
The place was very clean, included everything I needed, wifi was fast, tv was easy to use with apps, owners were ideal, etc. Highly recommend!"

The home is walking distance to many food and drink options downtown Anchorage, but still tucked enough away to enjoy some privacy. The home itself was ideal. Incredibly cozy, stocked with many food, snack, drink items. Bridget and Eric were very helpful in providing recommendations for our trip. We had such a wonderful time. Highly recommend staying here!

Secondly, the house is clean, and Bridget and Eric have thought of everything. There are bikes, a small cooler, a washer and dryer, etc.
Finally, and most importantly, the host was AMAZING. Bridget picked me up from my bus stop, she drove me around downtown to get me oriented, and she let me store my bags the day after I left in one of her other properties.
In short, this is an exceptional Airbnb."

You can hear the cars and big trucks and people walking by. But overall, the home itself feels nice and clean, and outside the windows you can see the beautiful mountains so near. They even have a washer and dryer too that I like because I was able to do my laundry at the end before I check out. If you are looking for a place to stay for a short while this place is really good, plus it has a lot of parking in the driveway that fits 5 cars.

Friendly host, lots of amenities to feel like home, nature right outside to connect with..the list goes on! We eloped on this trip so our marriage started in this a-frame, but even without that this beautiful space would have a soft spots in our hearts! Can’t wait to be back and then have to drag ourselves away again."

We enjoyed the hot tub in negative temps in the peaceful surroundings. We live in the borough but wanted to get away for a girls weekend. This was perfect because it was out of the way but close to restaurants and town. We went to Feather and Flour per the hosts recommendations and it did not disappoint. Best of all was how responsive and thoughtful Amanda was. She sent us a message to let us know the place was ready and we could check in early... so we did! She let us know that she saw it was extra cold out so she increased the heat for us and gave permission to bump up the thermostat but we ended up not having too. And when my friend locked her keys in the car at check out she offered to let us hang out in the house if we needed too. It was just really cute and cozy and we really enjoyed our 2 night stay! 5 stars!"

Amanda's place was elegant, sophisticated, with added personal touches. This was the perfect place to celebrate graduating nursing school as it is private and overlooks a river. All you need to bring is your clothes and a bathing suit, as all the linens, soaps, and paper products are provided. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook, including the staple spices and fresh ice.
If you are considering this place, yes, you need to stay here. The photos do not do it justice! The night sky is perfectly visible from the hot tub and we saw plenty of shooting stars and even a glimpse of the northern lights. I could have easily stayed two additional weeks, and still felt like I needed more time!
We will definitely be back!"

And that’s not even mentioning the hot tub….sitting in a 104 degree hot tub while it’s snowing, overlooking the mountains and the river. Epic. We will definitely be back….
Also the Butte, Jim’s creek, lazy mountain, and mat su peak (great hikes) are all just 10 minutes away. Bleeding heart brewery and a bunch of Palmer favorites are within a 5 minute drive too.

Stayed a few nights",Before even arriving Melissa was available for any questions and it was so seamless renting from her. I am so thankful for the area we were in because for the majority of our trip our car was filled with stuff as we got ready to move my daughter into her dorm at UAA. So I was not worried about it getting stolen or my car getting broken into. That was a huge plus for us! Thank you Melissa!! If my husband and I travel alone to visit my daughter we will definitely be booking again.

Stayed a few nights","Thank you Melissa for sharing your home with my sisters and I. Your little apartment worked out perfectly for a weekend stay in Anchorage. The apartment was exactly as shown in the photos, very clean and Surprisingly spacious! We were able to get in a few good hikes prior to departing for Home ….. which is exactly what we hoped to accomplish! I would highly recommend your property to anyone who is looking for a lovely place to stay that is still within 20 minutes of the airport, but completely away from the hustle and bustle of downtown!"

We really were grateful for them leaving a pack n play for our son and also for baby proofing the house for our son, very thoughtful! The house had everything we needed and more. The LED lights under the bed was very impressive and cool , we weren’t expecting that. If we visit anchorage again , this is a place we would stay."

I would absolutely recommend this apartment 11 to anyone who’s looking for an upscale very clean with the kitchen separate bathroom all the amenities that you will ever need. I will plan on staying here again and nowhere else in town. She also was very kind to let me check out late without a fee. She is very responsive and quick to your questions if there was one 200 this place is 200.

Stayed one night","Our stay at Kelly’s place was superb in every way- the cabin is gorgeous, the setting is private, beautiful and tranquil, and so comfortable. The location was perfectly situated between Palmer and Wasilla which was exactly what we needed and it’s a very easy drive from Anchorage. Everything you need is on site, including so many thoughtful touches, such as coffee, tea, spices and olive oil in the kitchen and lotion and essential supplies in the bathrooms. We especially appreciated the use of local products and recyclable materials. The fresh ground coffee bar with local coffee and reusable keurig pods was a treat in the morning. It was lovely watching the sun rise and set each day in these beautiful surroundings. Kelly was a wonderful hostess- she is thoughtful and responsive. I would definitely love to stay here again and highly recommend this wonderful place!"

The cabin had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, including all of the little things like salt and pepper, herbs and spices, shampoo and conditioner etc.
Kelly and Tricia are wonderful hosts with great attention to detail. Absolutely love the decor of this Cabin!
Thank you so much Kelly and Tricia"
