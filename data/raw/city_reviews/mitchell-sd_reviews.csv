And there was a small back area where we could let our dogs out quickly, and plenty of places nearby to walk the dogs.

Stayed one night","The apartment is exactly what I expected and looks just as good in person as the pics. It’s very spacious and each bedroom is quite private. The building is older and seems to be transitioning as not all of it appeared as updated as the apartment. But it was quiet and peaceful. Great price for the size and layout of the space.
We were only there for a quick overnight so can’t say much about the town."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed staying here. The apartment is very cute and has lots of character, and it was comfortable. Check-in was easy, and Anthony graciously offered to give us a late check-out, which was incredibly helpful. The location is the best part--it's in downtown Mitchell and close to everything. Being right on top of a coffee shop was very fun too (even though it was closed when we were there). The only thing I'd caution is that there are some steep stairs to get to the apartment; they were a little hard for my 77-year-old mother, but she managed. I would stay here again!"

We didn’t have a contingency plan when the snow hit so arrived a few hours early. The place is rustically decorated in the perfect way. The trickiest part was figuring out what to do with the car when the plows came through, but that was minor and short lived. We would 100% rent here again."

The only downside was that it was around 60° in the apartment even with the heat on. I know it's because this is an older place and it was -40° outside, but I still froze! Regardless, I travel to Mitchell off often and will stay here again. Next time I'll just bring my heated blanket :-)"

Stayed a few nights","Went up for pheasant hunt and Mitchell and wanted to stay somewhere besides hotel room. Found Anthony's place and was perfect for two hunters, clean comfortable well appointed with amenities as well as lots of extra stuff placed in the kitchen made it feel very much at home. Located in historic building on Main Street Mitchell it was conveniently located to corn palace, restaurants, sports bars, and other shopping in the downtown area and of course coffee shop directly below apartment. Even though on main street, it was not noisy at all. Will definitely book again next year and highly recommend anyone traveling to Mitchell to give it a try"

It is a bit of a climb to get to, so I would recommend for younger people or very fit older people. It does have a bit of a musty smell, but it is an older building. He gave very good checkout instructions. and we truly enjoyed our stay."

People with allergies like me may not do well with the smell. Clean and nicely decorated. Amenities are sufficient. I would say the price is high for what you get. Host never sent a personal message during our stay. All directions came from the site. They do ask you to get a load of laundry ready if you use towels which is unusual for Airbnbs as a whole as you pay a cleaning fee.

The apartment offers more than the pictures and description suggest - cozy, comfy beds in nice-sized bedrooms, fully stocked kitchen, great living room and dining spaces - spacious bathroom... remote working spots galore (office, dining table, couch...) easy to access and in walking distance to many attractions/restaurants/cafes! Off street parking was easy. Driving to El Columpio on the edge of town for dinner was a breeze -- and seriously delicious burritos (I live in Chicago, where there are hundreds of Mexican restaurants... and am now dreaming of El Columpio, wishing it had an outpost in my town...!). Would DEFINITELY stay again!"

Stayed one night","The location was convenient for a quick stopover, close to the corn palace, with clear instructions where to move the car overnight. We were a bit startled by a guy who came in and said he was checking on the AC right when we got there one hour after the check in time, but in all fairness the host had tried to contact me half an hour before check in, missed due to being on the road at that time. The dishwasher was still running, so I unloaded the dishes when they finished and reran what was visibly missed by the machine. I was awoken at 4am by what sounded like a critter scampering above or around the apartment and again by the coffee shop music below around 7. Floors weren’t the cleanest but they did match the rustic decor. All in all, a sufficient stopover with the basics."

Parking in the evening was a little tricky bc we had to circle the block a few times until we found an empty spot, but the nice thing is you can park in front of the bnb during the day which makes it very convenient!

Stayed a few nights","Thanks to Anthony’s check in instructions, the spot was very easy to find.
The apartment itself is well equipped and very comfortable (even when it hit 106 degrees outside, the apartment stayed ice cold).
If you have to stop in Mitchell for any reason, you really can’t do much better than this. Just down the stairs there is a solid little coffee shop with good breakfast and coffee, and there are several bar/restaurant options within a couple blocks if you don’t feel like cooking any meals.
10/10 would stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in Mitchell.
*** one word of advice to airbnb’ers, be sure to park where the listing says and/or check your street signs carefully! I got a $30 parking ticket parking on the wrong part of 3rd street, and the sign that indicated no parking was on the other side of the street and facing the opposite direction."

We did some light cooking and everything we needed was available. The back yard looked really cute, but we did not need to utilize it. Great water pressure and temperature in bathroom. I felt safe in the neighborhood. I had to park my truck and 16 foot trailer out front with very expensive motorcycles on it, they were not messed with at all. I would definitely stay here again!

I work from home and the internet was super fast, kitchen was fully equipped and the TV had a RoKu that we were able to use our Direct TV subscription easily. The home was very clean and well equipped for long stays and very convenient and walkable to many bars and restaurants downtown.

Stayed one night",Decent place located near the Corn Palace. Furniture is pretty rough and some were dirty/stained. Looks like it all came from a second hand store. Host was very worried about having shoes taken off as soon as you get in the door so the old white rugs in the house don't get stained.

Stayed with kids","The house was beautiful and close to Main Street, where we spent most of our week at ""Your Shop"". I'm awful at reviews, but here are the important bits.
The kitchen had everything we needed for our stay. The house was clean and had plenty of linens. The beds were comfortable, and the two real beds were a different firmness. So, you can pick what you want. There was a swingset in the backyard that I don't remember seeing in the photos. The kids loved it.
It is perfect for your average family vacation.
(I mention this only because I know it is nice information to know as we frequently travel with handicap family members. The home is not handicap accessible. It didn't matter to us, but if you have a wheelchair or a family member who needs assistance with hygiene routines, it will be a struggle.)"

I have always considered using ABnB but was worried that it could be a hassle and would destract me from my very busy schedule. Boy was I wrong thanks to Selena, she was very helpful and even accommodated me reserving the place last minute. I couldn't appreciate it more and I don't think I will be booking hotels from now on. Amazing experience for half the price, can't wait to book my next adventure!"

Stayed with kids","Very quaint little home! My family of five was able to take a break from the road, and get a good nights sleep here! The home has a very well-stocked kitchen, bathroom, and living area. There are books and games, and a large dining table. The king bed was a BIG plus, and all of the bedding was very comfortable. There was construction outside, but Selena was very communicative and gave us perfect directions to avoid the obstruction. The home is older construction, and the bathroom is very narrow. This wasn’t an issue for the majority of us, but my husband is a very broad man, and found it a bit difficult to maneuver in there. Not necessarily a bad thing, but something to be aware of, especially for people with limited mobility. Great stay, and would stay again!"

Stayed one night","Check in was super easy! Selena was very responsive - very awesome. It's an older home - several things have been updated but still somewhat outdated. But home functions just fine and is cute and clean. Very small bathroom but there are at least additional mirrors throughout the home to facilitate getting ready. This home is walking distance to downtown events - all the hotels are too far away so that makes this location super handy in that regard. There is only 1 bed large enough to comfortably sleep 2 people - something to keep in mind if you are planning for it to house several adult couples, bigger bodies may not be comfortable doubling up. Nice place though and would stay here again for sure!"

We did not feel safe in the house nor the neighbourhood as the back door was unlocked when we arrived, and there was yelling in the streets around the corner. Also, the pictures do not depict the condition of the house, specifically how old and dirty the kitchen is. It was one of the dingiest places we have been. I did not feel safe cooking let alone eating in there. On top of that, the house smelled of cigarettes. So, we left immediately and did not stay the night. We were not refunded for the stay, and Selena accused us as trying to scam her."

Be aware that the bathroom is tight, but has everything you need - including information about trouble shooting any switch problems. Unlike much larger bathrooms where we have stayed, the exhaust fan was terrific and it wasn't steamy at the end of my shower - although there was plenty of hot water which I took full advantage of.
Selena was great about communicating at the beginning and end of our stay and was available via text for any questions/problems (we had none).
Thank you again Selena."

Very close to Main Street restaurants and the Corn Palace, and a great value for the amount of space & having a whole place to yourself! There were standard condiments in the fridge and seasonings in the cabinets. Overall a very well stocked kitchen! There was also a little recipe box of some of Selena's favorite recipes, and recipes that other guests have left, which was such a sweet and personal feature! We didn't have time to try any of the recipes, but maybe on another trip. :)"

Stayed one night","Spent one night to break up a long travel from Omaha to Mt. Rushmore. Charming, very clean, well-stocked cottage very close to both the Corn Palace and I-90. Had the pots and pans that I needed to make the family a scrumptious pot roast at the end of a long day...and so much more satisfying than fast food. Be aware there are a few stairs at both front and rear entrances. But, that was OK for this 70s couple because we had our 18 year old grandson with us to give us a helping hand. Fast, prompt communication with owner. Would definitely recommend this rental."

We enjoyed the beauty of the farm in the background and occasional animal noises. We gazed at the moon and then watched the sun rise the next morning.
The space was more than adequate for our family of six. Our 4 kids slept in the loft while my wife and I shared the main floor bedroom. My kids are already asking when we can go back.
I’d highly recommend Theodore’s place to anyone seeking solitude and serenity of country living."

Our stay was a little different - the air conditioner didn’t work during high heat outdoor temperatures. George and his team were on-site almost immediately to diagnose the issue. Since it was a holiday weekend, there was not much that could be done (local repairmen were understandably unavailable). Our group had to relocate to a hotel, but George made sure Airbnb made us whole. I would absolutely stay at George’s house again, and I would recommend it to anyone."

We rented this house for our girls get together weekend. The six of us had an absolute blast. The house suited us perfecly with ample amount of space! We will be returning many times in the future!

This location is pretty far from restaurants and fresh food, so I recommend that you bring your own food with you before arriving. Would recommend!"

The home is decorated in a pheasant hunting theme and was well-outfitted for our larger group with plenty of sleeping spaces and amenities. The kitchen was fully equipped with every cooking implement you could possibly imagine or want, which made preparing meals easy. Details down to ziploc bags, laundry soap and coffee were covered! Jennifer and her family were easy to work with, responsive and helpful. We plan to stay here again the next time we are in South Dakota and have already recommended it to others. Thank you for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","This home is set up as a pheasant hunting lodge and has about any combination of bedding you could want or need. We 4 silver-haired old ladies in our late 70s and early 80s just don't want to have to sleep with anyone, so the 2 bedrooms with 2 twin beds each were perfect for us and no one slept in the 3rd bedroom that had, I think, a queen bed. It was nice, as well, 2 have 2 bathrooms on the main floor (one of which was 2 steps down from the kitchen into the back laundry area. All was perfect for us, and the kitchen was VERY WELL FURNISHED with about every appliance, spice, dishes you could ever want. About 1/4 mile from the owner's parents who came to check on us when we had a little difficulty connecting to the internet. (The basement had numerous beds set up as well as a well-furnished game room but not all of us even set foot in the basement."

Easy check in, tons of space! 7 beds in the basement we didn't even need to touch... between the the 3 bedrooms, pull out couch & chair, all 8 of us enjoyed a good night's rest upstairs. The pool table was a hit. The place is well suited for groups and caters to hunters. We felt welcome and had no questions or concerns about anything. I appreciated Jennifer's proactive communication. Comfortable place to stay and a really great place for us to meet up to kick off a fun vacation. Very grateful for the many wonderful memories that started at Jennifer's place!"

The yard is huge, not fenced, but we honestly we only saw a couple of cars pass by the house they entire time we there so it didn’t matter with the dogs. There is also a little cafe close by, 281 cafe, that’s wonderful: great fried chicken and shakes!!!"

Stayed one night","This is a great spot! Its very much a farm house but conveniently located.
There were just two of us and our dogs, but there would have been room for 10 more! Great value for all of that space! The grounds were kept nice and our dogs loved running in the yard and down the road to see the cows.
Unfortunately we were too tired from our long drive to enjoy the game room downstairs, but looks like fun!
Incase you didn’t notice in the listing, dogs have to stay downstairs. And there isn’t a fenced yard, but the house sits back on a road that is pretty far from the highway, so there’s plenty of room for them to roam.
Would recommend this place to anyone! It’s not fancy, but comfy. Would be a perfect spot for a hunting group or a small family reunion."

The property is huge (dogs will love it). Be careful if you are arriving at night as the street sign where you turn right is not that visible in the dark.

Great space, convenient location, kitchen with everything we needed, comfy sleeping spaces, and more than we could have asked for! TV and internet worked great. Hostess stopped by just to check in and dropped off cookies which was so nice! Gave us recommendations on a pizza place nearby that was delicious (Outback in Plankinton). We played games, had a fire, and just enjoyed country living for a week! Highly recommend and we plan to be back if we ever need a place to host another small group gathering!"

Huge yard, the house is bigger than it looks in pictures, the downstairs is such a fun area to play foosball and pool or just hang out and visit, the kitchen has anything you need to make a homemade dinner, the rooms are nice and everything is just placed so well throughout the house! It gave us that feeling of home! We are a Midwest family and when I think Midwest lifestyle this home fits it to a T! The only pain point we had experienced was it did get pretty warm in there in the later afternoon/evening, but it was in the high 90's outside. However, they do supply you with plenty of fans and there were 3 AC units upstairs to try and keep it cool. It was bearable for all the adults, but we had an infant and the heat really got to him and it took a long time for him to fall asleep comfortably. But again it was very hot outside and we did have quite a few people in the house! Such a great experience though and we will totally be coming back! If you are looking for that country lifestyle experience this is definitely the place for you! Thanks again Matt!"

The home is small, but extremely clean and comfortable. We had my husband, myself, our two young adult children, a teenager and two small dogs. The kitchen amenities allowed me to cook a home cooked meal or two while we were there. We like to stay here when visiting our son who is attending school in Mitchell. It is a perfect location to be able to go back and forth to Mitchell or Sioux Falls. This time we headed north to DeSmet and visited the home of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Thank you Rebecca for providing a nice little getaway location so this momma could check on her boy. We are incredibly appreciative."

The property was a bit further off of the highway than anticipated and a bit more dated than was reflected in the pictures. All in all, the place felt fairly clean, other than the ant issue (which was probably due to the time of season) and we saw a pretty large spider. The neighborhood was quiet and felt pretty safe, however, the back door had a trash bag strung across the window. All in all, the house was sufficient for a one night stay as we crossed South Dakota."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed overnight on our way to a vacation in the Black Hills. The home was very clean and comfortable. Kitchen seemed to be well-stocked, but we didn’t use it much, except to make coffee and quick breakfasts on our way out. Living room was cozy, and we were able to relax and watch a show together in the evenings, since we were able to log into our streaming apps easily on the TV’s Roku. Laundry room is a nice touch for longer stays, or just to wash anything that may have piled up from your travels. We loved being able to have our dog with us, and the neighborhood has plenty of sidewalks for walking her. Neighbors were friendly and waved whenever we were outside. Definitely recommend the home if you are in the area!"

The only downside was sharing the building with other apartment residents.

Overall, we were so grateful for a safe, private home away from home."

Mitchell is a nice enough town, small but enough to do and food and stores are conveniently close by. I felt safe. The road is a bit noisy which I didn't mind too much because I'm from a city but if that's not your jam, bring ear plugs! Would stay again if I found myself back in Mitchell."

It is nice and quiet, conveniently located, and Ben is proactive in making the stay the best it could be. It instantly felt like I was walking into an apartment cleaner than my home, with a more comfortable couch and bed than mine, too. Everything is modern and up-to-date. I would book this place in a heartbeat if I ever found myself near Mitchell again."

We were able to book a couple hours before we arrived the same day as we were passing through Mitchell. We were provided clear instructions on how to get in, where lights were located and how to operate TV. It was decorated nicely and felt cozy. My husband and I stayed with our two teenage daughters and we all agreed it was so much nicer than staying in a hotel. Our daughters said they slept pretty well on the sleeper sofa. It was nice to be able to brew a quick cup of coffee with the provided Keurig before we got on the road again."

This place was very clean and the air conditioner worked GREAT! We had some hot days in early July in South Dakota and the AC was a huge plus! If you're interested in the Corn Palace, you are super close. You can see the back of the Corn Palace from the front porch. I highly recommend taking a short walk to a coffee place/bakery called Michelle's Mad Batter. I got a great cup of joe and some breakfast sandwiches there. If I wasn't watching my caloric intake all the time, I would have definitely tried the macaroons and the chocolate-dipped peanut butter cookies. Very friendly staff. Loved Stacey's little touches-- the granola bars especially. Cute little place!"

I think there would be plenty of room for 4 maybe 5 people comfortably. Every comfortable sleeping arrangements even the pullout cough, my daughter had no complaints. They had way more to offer then what I would need while traveling. And A1 spotless clean, everything in the place was very nice. Super nice host, responded very quickly to my questions. I would definitely stay here again when I’m in Mitchell, I’m glad I found it.

I will definitely stay here again."

The shower stall is narrow and has slow water pressure, which made it difficult to get cleaned up. Kitchen was good and well stocked with what we needed."

Stayed one night","Exceeded all our expectations. Amazingly clean; lots of nice little touches (even robes!), nicely decorated, etc. Lovely place.
My one piece of advice for renters is to make a note of the door code when you get your check in instructions. We didn’t, as we didn’t realize that those instructions only show up once on the app. So we couldn’t lock the door when we went to dinner. Minor issue, though. We would stay at Stacy’s place again. So much nicer than a hotel at around the same price…"

Sleeper sofa accommodates 2 more people and a blow up mattress could accommodate an additional 2 more people (6 total) if you don't mind being a bit crowded. The washer/dryer is an added bonus. I grew up in Mitchell and thought this was a more interesting option than being in one of the motels out near the interstate, and I was right. When I go back to Mitchell, the Corn Palace Cottage will be my first choice."

Stacey left nice touches like robes and wonderful aromatherapy lotions in the shower room. Hand soaps and sanitizers were nice too! It was just the right size and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in at an airbnb location. So grateful for this cozy little cottage.

Beautiful kitchen with full size refrigerator, eating space, really perfect if you want to have meals in. Nice sitting room and bedroom and everything sparkling clean. My only comment was that the mattress was a bit soft. I like a firmer bed in general, so this may not be an issue for others. I would still stay here again. Thank you, Stacey!"

Stayed a few nights","You will LOVE how close this place is to the world-famous corn palace! It’s a very warm and welcoming house, right off Main Street and all the eatery/shops. We were there during the installment of the 2020 corn palace art and the artist/workers were super interesting to watch. The house from the outside looks like a business establishment, but it’s super comfortable and warm inside. Four thumbs up!!!"

Stayed one night","We checked in late as we were driving from Michigan to Wyoming and weren't 100% where wed end up stopping for the night. Stacey's place was the perfect stop. So cute and clean. Right downtown , we were able to walk down to the restaurant and eat. I loved that she had a hot plate and a Keurig, and as luck would have it she also had my favorite brand of k cups. Doesnt get much better than that. If we ever make travel back that way I would definitely stay again"

Stayed one night","My husband, our dogs, and I loved staying at Stacey's place in downtown Mitchell, South Dakota. It was a one-night stop on our way to Rapid City and Hot Springs from southeastern Wisconsin, and this was the perfect location; also easy to find across from the Corn Palace! Neat and cozy vintage home, decorated very charmingly with some great amenities: robes, keurig coffee, Belvita snacks, and more. The bedroom was very spacious to put the dog crates and our stuff. No yard for dogs, however, there is a cute teeny grassy dog park next to the Corn Palace with bags and trash cans. There may be other parks to walk to, but at night the palace and area is lit up so seems safer. Stacey was easily available to communicate with before and during the visit. The whole experience was great! Actually wish we had more time to explore the area on our journey."

She is readily available by email and her check in was a breeze. The Corn Palace lit up at night was a highlight. She is centrally located. I love hosts like Stacey who care about their guests beyond the price of the room. I highly recommend her place.

Stacey’s place was clean with wonderful amenities, she thought of everything. We enjoyed fresh eggs and the kitchen was well equipped for cooking.
She communicated well and directed us into town after the area was flooded.

Which is what my 14 year old daughter and I did and then walked main Street stopping at the Memorial Park and Ed's Pet World. Of course we went to the Corn Palace. We had family in town and it was nice not to have check into a Hotel etc. Prompt responses and very reasonable. We were able to modify the checkout time to coincide with our church plans so that was very kind of her. We'll stay here again!"

Group trip","The townhouse was just what we needed for our gathering, and the space was wonderful! Destiny responded to our heat problem quickly, and it was taken care of by a friendly HVAC tech, even late into the evening!
In that a few things ( accents etc) are dated and not in good repair, the furnishings were good. The cookware was NOT good - very old and rusty, but we left a note for them to be replaced. I would check the cooking utensils for replacement as well. The neighborhood was so very quiet, and the place very soundproof!!
Thank you for the opportunity to use this facility - we will look into it again, as we have family in the area!!"

Upon checkin we noticed one of the bed frames was broken and notified Destiny right away. She responded quickly and offered to have it repaired right away. Since we didn’t need that particular bed- it was a non- issue but just wanted it noted upon our arrival.
The area is very dark at night which was great for sleeping but if you need to walk pets or are outside you may want to bring flashlights etc.
It was a great stay and would definitely stay there again."
