The house is very cozy and clean. The location is great and we were able to visit all our destinations easily. She’s walking distance to a beautiful restaurant and park by Lake Macatawa. We enjoyed a great view of a parade and fireworks from the end of the driveway during tulip time festival.
She has lots of recommendations in her binder and was very proactive and friendly."

Stayed a few nights",Lynelle put a ton of effort to make this house feel like home. I have stayed at a ton of airbnb locations over the years and you can tell when a host really thinks through how to make a home comfortable and easy to follow instructions. I loved that she put notes in almost every room with information or instructions. It was nice to find sharp knives in the utensil drawer since we bring our groceries with us when we travel. The beds were comfortable which makes a huge difference when traveling. You can practically walk to the downtown area with lots of small business shops so that was fun! It was also beautiful because the tulips were blooming everywhere! I would absolutely stay here again!

We enjoyed the nice touches such as a welcome message board and local snacks. Might have been the time of year, but the view out front was mostly of some very high gravel piles across the street. The traffic on the road might be an issue for light sleepers."

Lynelle has being an Airbnb host nailed! The home was SPOTLESS and it had EVERYTHING we needed during our stay. The home was the perfect size, water pressure was strong, the location was great and the beds were very comfortable. I even was able to enjoy the outside space for my morning coffee at 30 degrees🥶. Lynelle goes way out of her way to make your stay perfect. The almond windmill cookies and local olive oil she left for us was great! Such a nice little touch 😊 We will definitely stay here again when we visit Holland in the future!"

This house is also in a perfect location. You’re so close to the fun shops and restaurants downtown and about 15 minute drive from holland state park beach which was amazing. We also really enjoyed the fire pit outside

Stayed about a week","We stayed a week over 4th of July at Lynelle’s cottage. This was our first time visiting Michigan and we were amazed at the beautiful surroundings. Best location for 4th fireworks & festivities. Front row view for fireworks! Loved having coffee on front porch with water views. Fantastic walking/biking paths along the waterfront. Two bikes provided so we did a lot of exploring on them. Easily walkable to so many local things to do! Great farmers market steps away from home. Loved the cottage, extremely clean & well appointed. Beds were incredibly comfortable with great linens. Lynelle is so generous stocking kitchen with snacks & coffee, etc. We cooked daily with ease and plenty of gadgets. She is so welcoming and friendly, wonderful host. We highly recommend staying here and will definitely return if we make our way back to Holland!"

The place was beautiful, Lynelle even had complimentary items, such as a toothbrush since my husband forgot his. She had a binder of fun things to do and everything was great! We would love to visit again when we have more time."

Lynette ensures that guests have a good weekend (or week) with little touches like snacks / treats, ice already made, and a nice array of dishes, cookware, and glassware; guests can easily either walk downtown to eat or cook in. The beds are comfy as is living area furniture. The house was cleaner than my own :). For couples or families visiting Holland, I would highly recommend the cottage..."

The bed upstairs was very comfortable. My only suggestion is to bring ear plugs or a noisemaker to help blockout the trucks, bulldozers, and small train across the street. It wasn’t bothersome during the day, but it did wake us up earlier than we would have preferred. However, everything else was so perfect that it wasn’t a dealbreaker!

Stayed a few nights",We had an amazing stay at Lynelle’s Holland rental. The location was perfect - we walked to downtown each day we were there and also enjoyed walking along the lakeside park. I so appreciated the small details (notes throughout the house and touches like fresh toothpaste and mouthwash for those that had forgotten theirs - like we did!). Thank you - we would love to stay again!

Lynelle met us shortly after we arrived to give a quick overview of the house and tips on places to go during our visit. The location is right across from a great park and a short walk from all of the shops and restaurants downtown."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Lynelle's place in early June. The location can't be beat -- we walked to downtown, the Farmer's Market, and Kollen Park nearly every day of our stay. We had our 10 month old with us and really appreciated how baby proofed the space was. The kitchen was well-stocked with cookware, pots and pans, and utensils, and Lynelle even had some spices, cooking oil, and coffee which is always a very nice touch. My husband and I did have a little trouble with how warm the upstairs room was at night, even with the AC working hard downstairs. We had a little thermometer we brought from home which showed the upstairs as 8 degrees warmer than the downstairs. Lynelle did provide fans which helped a little. Of course it was June in Michigan with the weather in the upper 80s when we were there, so this likely won't be a problem for everyone. Overall we loved our stay and would definitely return."

There was plenty of space for an air mattress. Both bathrooms were very nice. And, while a small thing, this house had the nicest and most plentiful toilet paper I've ever seen at an AirB&B.

The house was perfect for 3 couples. It has two bedrooms downstairs that share a bathroom and one upstairs with a second bath. We didn't do a lot of cooking with all of the great restaurants nearby but the kitchen and dining areas were fine. We did enjoy the deck. It was a great place for a morning cup of coffee. The furniture was comfortable and with the addition of a dining room chair, there was enough seating for all of us.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the Holland area!"

Stayed a few nights","A private, beautiful place to get away from it all! They offered amenities like OJ, a s’mores kit, bath robes and toothbrushes - meaning we didn’t have to worry about a singe thing. It was a cozy place to stay on several cold and rainy autumn nights. The colors were gorgeous and there were plenty of blankets. The hot tub was frequented every day, and was perfect even in the rain! We absolutely loved snuggling up in the screened in patio, a fire at our feet and a movie playing on the TV. If you’re city folk like us - don’t worry about the outdoor shower, the water never ran cold and it was more than private. It was peaceful and comfortable to shower even well into a dark evening. I echo my husbands words as we packed up - “This is the first Airbnb that I’m not ready to leave!”"

Stayed a few nights","If you like hot-tubbing in the woods you will love this airbnb! My daughter and I seek out unique places to stay on our annual mother daughter trip and this hit the mark A++ We loved the outdoor glamping experience so much! Everything from the airconditioned bedroom with comfy bed to the perfectly relaxing hot tub to the campfire with provided smores was perfect. The cozy screened-in porch provided more space since the bedroom area is quite small. I can't say enough about being able to chill in the hot tub with the campfire blazing a few feet away. We used it at night and in the morning both days. The outhouse wasn't the greatest though it is cute but the outdoor shower was adorable and it was super awesome to be able to shower in nature! It felt private, the water pressure was just right we loved that little area. The pond fountain was cool and necessary to turn on to drown out the highway noise. It's a perfect setting, close to everything. Did I mention the hot tub is amazing? :)"

Stayed one night","This was one of the best stays we have had using Airbnb. It was exactly as described and pictured. It was less than 10 minutes to get to all the shopping and restaurants in Saugatuck. 3 miles from Saugatuck Dunes State Park. The cabin was very private and secluded. Rhonda thought of everything to make you feel at home… there were a few drinks in the refrigerator, snacks, s’mores, towels, and robes and toothbrushes, body wash and shampoo/conditioner all provided. Hot tub was amazing and so clean. The bed was very comfortable.
We have Verizon cell service and did not have service most of the time when at the cabin and the signal wasn’t picking up the house WiFi (which isn’t anyone’s fault). Just an FYI for people who depend on it.
Will definitely stay here again when in the area!"

The host was really friendly and quick to respond.

The bed was comfortable the s’mores were a great touch after a long night out.

One suggestion we gave would be to maybe have a microwave or small grill near the fire pit to make meals or Maybe install a working restroom? Not a huge deal breaker for us though!
Otherwise, it was so beautiful and so relaxing! The little cabin was incredibly cozy, it was an amazing getaway! We plan to come stay again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed here for a couple nights following our wedding as a little get away before our big honeymoon trip in a few months. It was such a wonderful stay and felt very private even though we were on Rhonda & Don's property, it felt like we had plenty of privacy once we crossed the bridge to the tiny house! Rhonda thought of every little detail, we had snacks, drinks, wine, DVDs, games, robes, logs and newspaper to start a fire, bug spray and even a smores kit! It was in a great location close to Saugatuck & Holland. We really enjoyed exploring both towns but really loved being able to really RELAX when we made it back to the AirBnB to get away from it all after the stressful wedding planning process! The hot tub was just perfect for 2 people and smores really hit the spot. We can't wait to come back!"

The bed is the comfiest ever, the hot tub beautiful and clean, the outdoor shower feels like a long sigh after a hard days work.

She provided some snacks for the stay along with a few drinks! That won me over in itself. The outside covered patio was great for coffee in the morning or movies at night. The bed was very comfy! Take time to enjoy nature and the privacy you get here. Don't let the houe in the front bother you because once you cross the bridge you feel like you are completely alone on a small resort. Truly best vacation we have had!

Stayed a few nights","John and Ami provided the easiest, most comfortable stay in my extensive housing rental experience. The apartment is perfect for any range of needs--breakfast table, stove, windows and a remote AC. I also really appreciated the clarity of expectations for move-out/cleaning...makes everything easier and quicker during the semi-rush on Sunday. Hospitality was also top notch. John made sure to check in regularly via the app for any needs or questions. He even offered to bring my mistakenly forgotten suitcase downtown which was above and beyond but much appreciated. Would highly recommend this listing!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great little place to stay! This place is so cozy and comfortable that you’ll enjoy coming back to it after a day out sightseeing. The hosts have thought of everything from snacks and drinks to bathroom toiletries if you’ve forgotten anything when packing. Even though we didn’t do much food preparation we noticed how well stocked the kitchen was with equipment. As noted by others and also the host, they are working on major reconstruction of the street so you will have to drive through part of it to get to the apartment but John let’s you know how to best approach his place in the easiest way. As an added token of that inconvenience he even provided a free car wash. This place is a great find so don’t hesitate to book it."

They offered us a car wash coupon due to the construction. Also, we forgot a jacket and they mailed it back to us quickly. We highly recommend staying with John & Ami if you get the chance!"

They have an amazing gift of knowing when to be available and neighborly and when to offer privacy. Being in a neighborhood was lovely! It's quiet and great for taking walks - and yet commercial areas are just a quick drive away. We loved being able to put our bikes in the little sunroom to keep them safe and out of the weather. And seeing the wild turkeys feeding in the neighbor's yard next door one morning was fun!! The space is small - but sparkling clean and the bed was very comfortable!! It made our stay in Holland a real treat!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed 2 nights at this cute and comfortable, easy to find place during the Tulip Time festival for our anniversary. The rental was just right as far as space for 2 and being positioned relatively close to festivities.
As a designer of sorts, I appreciated the simple, stylish decor provided. There was also functional furnishings like front entrance hooks for coats, purses and keys and a multilevel coffee table in the living room for our phones, tablets, tea and snacks. In the bedroom, inviting pillows dressed the bed, small lamp lighting gave the space moodiness and floating shelves optimized the space well.
We also personally utilized the comfy couch one night to watch some shows, stove and fridge for heating up water and storing a few picnic items as well as the bathroom shower in the morning. Water was hot, towels were fresh and fluffy.
John and Ami were flexible and stayed in good communication leading up to and through our visit. Would recommend to others :)"

A stay with them was like visiting our parents, with none of the guilt trip! If we find ourselves in Holland again, we'd rebook in an instant!"

There were quite a few brochures about things to see and places to eat in the area. There were pictures of the family and evidence of family interests. There was workout equipment available. The one downside is the full length of stairs to get to the lower level -- hard to carry suitcases up and down. Overall, we can highly recommend our stay with Todd and Mary."

Close to all that Holland and the surrounding area has to offer, this charming neighborhood airbnb was just right for us. Todd and Mary communicated clearly and quickly with us, and have many thoughtful suggestions for things to do and see in Holland. Spacious, warm, and bright, the exposed lower level is filled with hospitality. Many thoughtful touches are available~ tea and coffee, water in the mini fridge, microwave, specialty bath soap, soft towels, as well as a small library of books and movies to enjoy. Knowing it was an anniversary trip, Todd & Mary left us flowers and a bottle of wine, a warm welcome! We hope to return to the Holland area, and would stay at their lovely airbnb in a heartbeat."

The place is exactly as pictured in the listing, with helpful instructions on how to use all of the equipment and appliances. The weather was a bit cold, windy, and dreary - perfect for curling up on the couch by the fireplace and reading a book from their extensive reading collection and watching some good ol' Monty Python videos (Don't worry if British humor isn't your thing - they have a large and varied collection of other movies and TV shows on DVD and VHS). The hosts were friendly and responsive to communication. I would recommend Todd and Mary's place to anyone visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","Had a great stay at Todd & Mary's place! The lower level is very spacious - bedroom is separate from the living area (which has an awesome fireplace, extensive library, tv and some gym equipment). It's a quick 10 minute drive to downtown Holland. Todd & Mary had good suggestions for local food/things to do and were gracious enough to let me check out a little bit later due to work calls I needed to take. Thoughtful touches (i.e. chocolates) and quick communication - it's easy to see why they are superhosts!"

It’s a bit removed from the center of things, a safe, convenient, close in location to everything in and around Holland. The hosts communicated well by labeling and texts, with simple directions. It was like staying at an extended family members home as a guest while they’re away. Though we never met, our interaction was friendly and comfortable. I felt welcomed."

Stayed one night","Todd and Mary were gracious hosts, but we knew that already based on the reviews. Check-in was just as they described, very simple and fast, and before we went downstairs to the apartment, they gave us some tips on the area. Since it was our first time in Holland, we really appreciated that. The apartment has all of the amenities they listed, but once you see the place, it’s even better than expected. It was very clean, the shower is larger than what you’d expect, and the little extras were plentiful, down to the chocolates on the nightstand. (And thank you for the water bottles in the fridge!). If you come to Holland with a full itinerary, you’ll love coming back each night to a welcoming home. If you’re just escaping the daily grind, there are plenty of movies and books to sit and chill with. Todd and Mary have taken all the precautions for this COVID era, and we felt very safe in our stay. If you’re still thinking about whether or not to stay, take my advice and go visit Todd and Mary’s place. You will not be disappointed."

Cozy rooms, the pictures in the walls made me feel right at home. Clean bathrooms and beds. Overall, it was a great stay given it was a last minute decision! Kathy was very feldible with the schedule as well re checkin and check out times. There is a driveway parking too.
Overall we had a great stay, watched home alone for the night, and would definitely love to stay again this summer when we visit Holland!"

Stayed with kids","Kathy's Airbnb is a remarkable embodiment of cleanliness, comfort, and homeliness. The meticulous attention to cleanliness is evident in every corner of the accommodation, with pristine linens, spotless surfaces, and an overall aura of impeccable hygiene.
What truly sets Kathy's Airbnb apart, however, is the undeniable feeling of being at home. The personal touches that adorn the space, from family photographs, beautiful framed quotes, carefully curated decor, lend a unique and inviting character to the accommodation. Guests are welcomed with open arms, and Kathy's Airbnb becomes not just a place to stay but a genuine home away from home.
Kathy, Judy, and Jim go above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to hospitality. Their warmth and kindness are unparalleled.
Staying at Kathy's is not merely a temporary stay; it is an unforgettable journey into the heart of warmth, comfort, and genuine human connection."

Kathy provided everything needed for breakfast; milk, orange juice, yogurt, cold cereals and delicious homemade granola!

The gardens out back were beautiful for the eyes as well as for the soul. Kathy and Jim allowed us to use their garage for our bikes, and Jim was so kind to put our bikes back on our bike rack! This was such a wonderful experience, that I almost have my husband talked in to going up for a few days in the fall. Holland was such a pleasant town and I would like him to experience some of it."

Kathy's place has an incredibly GORGEOUS backyard, including a patio and table where you may sit and relax, taking in all the beauty with a cup of coffee or a glass of your wine, and if you are lucky they may join you! Their suggestions for things to do on our Michigan coast trip, even beyond Holland, were amazing and many ended up being some of our favorite destinations! A special thanks to Jim for sharing his wonderful travel knowledge and ideas with us, for which we are grateful!

The space was as described and it was clean. They went the extramile by providing some simple breakfast items, including milk, juice and cereal. There were also TWO cookie jars! YUMMY! The location was perfect for me, very close to where I was visiting family. A very nice part of Holland on a quiet tree-lined street."

Stayed one night","Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely!
Such a bright, clean, and well appointed space…. So many thoughtful details, even homemade cookies!
I have never dared to book a basement space… but I completely forgot it was a basement space as it feels like a homey but complete hotel studio space. Of course, there is some noise from upstairs, but the bedroom is very quiet.
The hosts keep the house and space cozy, but space heaters are available and the shower is warm and great… man a warm shower that has great water pressure cannot be undervalued!!
Proximity to Lake Michigan, the beaches, the dunes, the lighthouses, SNOW, rivers, trails, and even Chicago is brilliant… soo many things to do in every direction. I was able to join an exhilarating winter hike on the beach, just 15 minutes or so away.
Such a lovely host couple who warmly communicated throughout my stay!
Thank you, and look forward to next visit!!"

It was nice to get warm and cozy. The location was close to my event and to downtown, I was able to find things to do. Kathy's homemade granola and chocolate chip cookies were amazing.
I was concerned about not having a private entrance, but this was easy, and I appreciated the hospitality and friendliness of Kathy her family. I hope to visit again."

Stayed a few nights","Kathy's place in Holland is a perfect example of why we prefer airbnb to hotels. It's a beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood - great for walks and a short drive to restaurants and other businesses.
The lodging is a very spacious basement suite - one of us could be working in the living room without disturbing the other in the bedroom. There is not a private entrance, but Jim and Kathy and Jodi are happy to deal with who you are (sociable or not :-)).
We were very impressed with their generosity - we arrived to homemade cookies, milk and juice, bottled water, and a selection of cereals. Holland's water is also perfectly good for drinking.
We'd definitely want to stay at Kathy's place again!"

The backyard is a show piece and your accommodations are an entire spacious lower level with everything you need. There is plenty of parking in front of the house and the neighborhood is beautifully manicured and very quiet. It is a short drive to Saugutuck or downtown Holland. I loved it! You will too.

Stayed one night","What a treasure! I harness AirBnB regularly but it’s less often that I will opt for a “private room” and only do so after reading the reviews. I’m so glad I stayed at Kathy’s! While I was only booked for one night, Kathy and her family made sure that I had everything that I needed (and more!) and honored my scheduling/communication needs. She generously left me cookies, milk, OJ, and a selection of yogurts. This listing is for a basement apartment which includes a living room with a couch, coffee and end tables, three arm chairs, a work desk, and a small dining table with two chairs. There is a kitchenette with a nice sink, small countertop fridge and microwave. The bathroom has a sink, toilet, corner shower (hot water!) and ample places to hang wet towels. The bedroom has a queen bed with a metal coil mattress, and extra pillows in the closet where there is also a fan and space heater if needed. There was also a window in the bedroom, and a light on each side of the bed with a small place to set something. Entrance to this unit is from inside their home, either front door or from inside the garage. This is unit is in a partially finished basement with doors to a finished storage area, and keep in mind that West Michigan is humid as it’s close to those gorgeous white sandy beaches! During the day I could hear piano lessons etc, but it was very quiet at night, other than the crickets singing outside. Be sure to plan some time to relax and enjoy their green thumbs because what a garden they have made! I look forward to sitting and enjoying the garden, which backs up to the tree line, the next time I come. Thanks Kathy!"

Best of all was the kindness, graciousness and compassion of the three hosts: Kathy, Jim and Jodi."

Stayed a few nights","Kathy, Jim, and Jodi are lovely hosts. Kathy was prompt with communication, flexible, and friendly. The unit was close to everything downtown Holland has to offer. We especially enjoyed the farmers market and Bowerman's Cafe on 8th. We were in town for a three-day event in Holland. Kathy gave us a quick tour upon arrival and then gave our family privacy to unpack. The basement unit was clean and generous in size, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchenette was set up like a hotel with a small table. Plan to meal prep, bring microwaveable meals or eat out. It was good value and much less than area hotels for the same weekend. The best part of our stay was Kathy and Jim's stunning backyard. A true gardener's delight with pebble paths and stunning flowers. June was the perfect time to visit! Per previous reviews, we brought a cozy sweatshirt and an extra blanket as the basement runs a bit cool. It was a good temperature for sleeping. We truly enjoyed our weekend and will book again in the future."

We were extremely grateful for the space and all that it offered—very close proximity to downtown for walking, next to the park etc. Great space. Lots of room for an attic apartment and the kitchen was a really nice thing to have access to. It’s an old house so lots of character and quirks, but everything worked really well, was very clean, and felt pretty private. It does have maybe the squeakiest floor I’ve ever experienced, and the stairwell up into the attic is very tight and pretty steep (both very common of old houses). Overall, I’d say it was a great stay."

Terrific location near beautiful Hope College and a short walk to town to enjoy coffee shops and restaurants.
Very Spacious (and comfortably fit 4 adults). Charming, clean space on 3rd floor of an historic in-town Victorian home.
Beautiful artwork and wonderful photography books.
Rob (the Host) was very quick to respond to questions / requests…. And was very accommodating for our request for a late check-out on a long holiday weekend. Thank you Rob!
Steep stairs to 3rd floor... which was not an issue for us.
It's an older building so please have patience with the shower water pressure.

The apartment/house is nice and quiet all day and the WiFi was speedy, making it easy for me to work remotely a few days during our stay.

I stayed for a month, so I had plenty of time to form an opinion. Kitchen is charming and decently equipped, Studio has plenty of room, and beds were amazing! I slept peacefully every night without fail. I would suggest one improvement: Most of the windows did not have screens, and of the three that did, only one was completely intact. Visiting in late August and early September would have been a lovely time to have my windows open, but I could not for fear of visiting insects. The unit does have two window air conditioning units that kept me perfectly comfortable. But if you prefer fresh air, this will be an issue."

I can’t recommend staying here enough!

The host was extremely friendly and responded very quickly to all my questions. We had a hard time with the stairs (steep and narrow) but we were fairly warned. I worked in the evenings and the floor creaked quite a bit when I walked around the house. I hope the downstairs neighbors didn’t mind! I was a bit cold in the evening, so it’s best to bring something warm to sleep in. Overall, it was a great trip! Thank you!!"

The air b n b was adorable and perfect for our needs. Both bed rooms were nice sized and the gigantic TV was fun to watch! It was hooked up to all the roku options too! The kitchen was stocked with everything one could need, a thoughtful touch. We never had a moment where we had to run and get something from the store. The bathtub is incredibly deep which allows for a most elegant soak, much needed as a parent, finally without children, on a long needed get away, during a pandemic. 😆 We had an absolutely lovely stay here. 10 out of 10 would recommend and stay again!"

My husband and I absolutely loved the quiet and the privacy the loft provided us. The location really is spot on and we pretty much walked everywhere our entire vacation. It was convenient to have a mini fridge to store our leftovers. Though there were other people living below us, we never once heard a peep out of them after quiet hours, so getting a good night’s sleep was a non issue. Rob was available all the time in case we needed anything. The loft was the perfect place for us to stay and if we stop in Holland again in the future we will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Rob's attic apartment is perfectly located in a historic house on a leafy block just a 1/2 block to the main city park and steps to downtown. It felt like I was walking into a storybook walking up onto the wrap-around porch and into the house up to the attic. The steps up to the 2nd floor are standard and the steps to the attic are just a little steeper than your standard steps. Not a problem for our family, but just to note. The apartment is lofty, bright, and airy. It feels like an artists loft with a kitchen, open living space (great for gathering), and 2 bedrooms. Clean, well-appointed, and perfect location make this a great option in Holland. Rob was just a great host and was quick to respond to any questions. The charm and feeling like a character in a book was a bonus!"

Stayed with kids","This apartment is fantastic! Love the old house and the modern upgrades. The hosts communicate well and are easy to reach if need be. We stayed in the summer and even though we were (literally) in the attic it wasn’t uncomfortable or hot at all.
We walked to downtown and the lakefront with no problem from the apartment. It’s a really sweet historic neighborhood, and we felt really safe walking(even at night). The final flight of stairs into the attic are narrow, we were glad to have brought duffles as opposed to big suitcases. The fridge is a small “dorm size” so don’t plan on bringing excessive refrigerator/freezer goods. We brought an 11mo old and the hosts provided a baby get for the top of the stairs and toys. We didn’t feel like her crawling or fussing was an inconvenience to anyone else in the house, it wasn’t an “echoing old home”.
We would do it all again!"

He even managed to fit in a small kitchen with a portable induction burner in the space, along with a (playable!) acoustic guitar :) Downtown (8th street) is about a 5-10 minute walk. We had stayed at Holland before and this is much more convenient than the last place we stayed at. Rob is also very accessible and checked in on us via message during our 3-day stay. We enjoyed the stay greatly and had everything we needed. Thanks!"
