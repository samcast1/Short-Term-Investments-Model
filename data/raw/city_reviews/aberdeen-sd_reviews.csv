Stayed with kids","The hosts were excellent, available and ready for anything. The apartment itself is located in an excellent place, clean, tidy and very pleasant. The house was simply charming and with a homely and good feeling.
Unfortunately there was a problem with the washer dryer that burned our clothes, it took some time to fix it. We were given a solution of another clothes dryer in the basement.
One thing that should be changed is the doors to the rooms and the bathroom. Honestly, you hear everything from all the rooms, the doors are very noisy and it disturbed the night.
Despite what I wrote we had a good experience."

Never have I felt more welcome. Fireplace, tvs, blankets, tons of linens: they've truly thought of everything. The cottage is so warm and welcoming. It's decorated so well: you feel like it's a vacation every day!"

Ben and Leslie are always quick to respond to any questions, needs we have. We have learned that we need to act early so we can reserve this Cottage when we want it. It makes sense that it is often already reserved."

Group trip","I spent a few days at the house with my bridesmaids and it was way better than what we expected. We loved the atmosphere and the attention to detail. It helped us find things easier and that’s a plus for us. The house was put together, and it was quite homely. We were able to cook and use the kitchen with ease. We also noticed that the house was very family friendly including games and books for kids. (My mother in law, who is a local, knew the hosts and told us a bit of their story, and the Airbnb reflects their personality and character, and their love for kids.) We definitely recommend this Airbnb, and we’re sure that Jerry (the local squirrel) also recommends this house.
We thank you Ben and Leslie!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great time at this airbnb. They seemed to have thought of everything. We didn't have to purchase anything extra during our stay. My 1 year-old LOVED the toys provided by the host (but also loved the sound they made falling down the gated stairs). Only complaint was there was no way to lock the barn doors, except for the bathroom door once inside. It was hard keeping the baby from opening them and exploring once he figured out how. We had fun feeding and watching Jerry the squirrel. We can't wait for our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Lusso Cottage is the perfect place for us. My sister and I grew up near Aberdeen. We went to Northern so Aberdeen is very much home for us. However, our parents are gone now and it never ever felt quite right staying in a hotel. This cottage provided us with a place that felt like we were spending time at home. There is downtime when visiting family and it was so nice having a place to hang out and relax. Absolutely every possible creature comfort was taken care of by Ben & Leslie. I know this may sound silly but the lighting in the cottage is fantastic! Loved it! We will now plan our visit around the availability of the cottage. We can’t thank Ben & Leslie enough!"

The cottage was both beautiful and practical with its finishings and amenities. It felt like a Joanna Gaines home. Backyard patio was a nice bonus in the mornings and evenings. Driving to local restaurants and attractions from the cottage was under 10 minutes which was so nice with young kids. Excellent place to stay; we can’t wait to recommend to family and friends."

I had trouble with the front door lock the first time I was trying to leave on a food run and they were there to help in less than 10 minutes! Super cozy place to stay that I truly felt at home in. I ended up extending my stay by two days because of a blizzard and they were very accommodating; told me not to worry about being out by check-out the day I left and wait until I felt the roads were okay. They were even texting me road reports on my way home. I will absolutely be staying there next time I am in Aberdeen even though I could stay at my sister's house which is three blocks away and free!

Lots of towels, waterfall shower, beds were comfy, a variety of coffee, fresh cookies, Alexa singing carols, and peanuts to feed Jerry (the cottage’s resident squirrel). Many thanks to Ben and Leslie for enabling us to feel like we were indeed home away from home."

The hosts had everything we needed and more. I loved being able to do laundry and having spots to store our clothes for easy access. This place immediately felt like home with how cozy and welcoming it is. We were able to cook a few meals and the kitchen was well equipped with what we needed. I worked remotely a couple of days and the WIFI was excellent for video calls. My son enjoyed playing with the games and feeding Jerry the squirrel each morning! Those little extras made our trip memorable. Thanks again for a great stay!

Stayed with kids","Just perfect….. from the moment we saw the cute little cottage in the city, we fell in love! The owners took care to leave the lights on for us when our arrival time ended up much later than we anticipated. This home features a ton of tiny touches that you wouldn’t even think of as an option while traveling (like built in night lights, toys, books, games, s’mores)! There are a million other positive points that I would share….but I will let you be as pleasantly surprised as I was. This home fit my family of 5 perfectly. The 3 kids slept in the kid room and my spouse and in the master. There was plenty of space in the open living/dining/kitchen area and private backyard. The neighborhood was quiet. The backyard was great for early morning coffee with the resident squirrel named Jerry and late night s’mores by the fire pit. They thought of everything! Seriously, every little last thing. They are well-deserving of the super host title and the 5 star reviews! They are the best of the best in hospitality with this Airbnb!"

We were visiting a student at Northern State and it was a short walk to campus . The neighborhood was safe and we loved the town of Aberdeen. We will be back to visit again and we definitely will be staying at Ben and Leslie’s again !"

The kitchen was well stocked with cooking implements. There were plenty of towels and linens. The space was more than adequate for the two of us and our stuff. The neighborhood is cute and quiet. The walk to downtown and to the NSU campus is very easy.
The hosts were thorough in their information and instructions. Luckily, we didn’t have a single issue during our stay, but I suspect the response would be quick and helpful should something arise."

Ben was very attentive to clearing the walkways when it snowed, and Leslie was even nice enough to lend us a couple of inflatable tubes so we could go “sledding” down the snowy hills for fun! I would recommend it to anyone looking for housing here in Aberdeen, and would definitely stay here again!!"

Stayed over a week","Far beyond my expectations...(First timer AirB&B guest) so much so that I had no hesitation extending my stay an added three (3) weeks around the corner in ""Lusso Cottage"" owned and managed by Leslie & Ben. The décor at both location are very well thought-out to surround you with that homely/comforting feeling for this traveling technician who is on the road 8-9 months out of a year.
Both properties are clean, efficient and Leslie & Ben are very welcoming as well as attentive to the question and needs of their guest.
I give 5 Stars to every aspect of my stay at both properties. If I am ever back this way, my first call will be to Leslie & Ben. ""Hi! do you have anything open I can book""?
Great!"

She and her parents(our daughter and son-in-law) set up down stairs and they had their own private space...just like home! The location made it easy to get to any part of town easily. And as a bonus, Independence Day fireworks at Wylie Park can be enjoyed from the yard! Very comfortable house.
The kitchen, bathrooms, showers, and bedrooms were all more that adequate. Very clean. Appears to be an older home that has been nicely renovated. To be up front, there are several older homes in the neighborhood that could use some paint. Also, there is a train yard nearby. My granddaughter enjoyed watching the train activity in the mornings before departing for our daily destinations. We all agreed we would stay there again without hesitation should we ever be in the Aberdeen area for another reunion or activity. Thanks Deb!"

But I have to say how wonderful Deb was after our stay there. We were over an hour outside of Aberdeen on our way home when I received a call from Deb. She asked if I had left a camera lens. This was the first that I was aware that I had left a relatively expensive lens at her Airbnb. She offered to send it to me. She sent me a USP receipt with a tracking number. I'll receive the lens tomorrow. I can't thank her enough for fixing what would have been a pretty expensive mistake."

living areas is comfortable. The beds are comfortable, too. The electric fireplace on each level is an added touch. The host was accommodating and responded to our questions. We left an accessory bag in the house. She contacted us and offered to mail it back.
The railroad tracks are nearby so you will hear train activity.
The cottage has all that you need for a weekend visit or extended stay in Aberdeen."

Stayed with kids","The cozy cottage was exactly that. We had 2 families that needed a place to stay for a baseball tournament in Aberdeen and this place was perfect for our needs. The cottage is not huge but had plenty of space, bedrooms, and bathrooms for both our families. Deb was very gracious in allowing us to get out of a 2nd night that was not needed once the schedule for the tournament became available after we had booked the 2 nights. We were able to wash the kids uniforms which was a big help considering the temps were close to 100 degrees. The neighborhood was incredibly quiet with very little traffic to worry about. Communication with Deb was easy as was checking in and out. We'd stay again if the opportunity presented itself. Thanks for everything Deb,

We appreciated the two living room spaces for the kids to do their own thing with plenty of room to gather for a game of cards upstairs. The location was perfect, close to stores but not on top of other homes. The host was very responsive and flexible in all our needs for the month.

So this home was a welcome relief as all the boys and their significant others could hangout in one location. We had ample room to hangout and play games.

Plenty of blankets and pillows. Chairs were soooo comfy. Lights were easy to find and navigate. The house was perfect for me and my daughter, dad, brother and wife, and brother and son. All 4 motorcycles fit into the garage with room to spare - it was so nice not to have to warm them up for 10 minutes before taking off. Such a great stay - I do recommend and would stay here again!"

Didn’t contact host due to not wanting to wake them. We then forgot to contact them. We ended up paying for a shelf we didn’t break. It fell off of brackets on its own. Oh well.

This was a perfect place for our family of 5 to be able to settle into each night and not be a burden at our relatives houses. Location is great and I hope that I can book again come hunting season because the ability to have the dogs in the garage is a huge plus. As far as accommodations in the Aberdeen area go, you couldn’t expect much better. I, selfishly, wish I could leave negative comments so that it’s more available when I want to book it. Lol. In all seriousness, this place was great. I’ll stay again in the future."

Our only regret is that we didn't get to spend enough down-time relaxing at Melrose Central, but we hope we can stay here again on our next trip to Aberdeen. Thank you, Theresa!"

Stayed a few nights","Theresa was a terrific host. Very communicative before, during, and after stay. House was clean, comfortable, and roomy and would have been great for longer stays or larger group. The large yard would have been a good place for a family gathering / picnic, or even just playing outdoor games with kids. Very conveniently located on a quiet corner with easy access to local businesses.
The mattresses and pillows were more firm than we are used to, but didn't bother us after the first night and, honestly, much better than very soft/unsupportive/uncomfortable bedding we've run into elsewhere.
The kitchen and bathrooms were stocked with necessities - plenty of towels, bed linens, pillows, utensils, dish soap, etc. One recommendation for travelers: if you need ice, stop for a bag before check-in. If you forget, there are plenty of convenience stores and grocery stores within a very short drive.
All in all, I highly recommend Theresa and her property!"

The house is furnished very nicely, the beds are very comfortable, and the kitchen was well equipped with nice appliances too. There isn’t a dishwasher, but that was okay. We took turns washing the dishes. There isn’t central air conditioning, but the wall air conditioning units cooled down the rooms very quickly. Sometimes they were a little loud, but we made it work for us. The host is super friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this place."

Two bedrooms upstairs has king size beds plus lots of extra space- which was useful as we had two families staying with pack and plays/cots for little kids and there was plenty of space! There’s not a great table space for eating, but we did find a large foldable table and chairs downstairs- so we just moved it up for the weekend and it worked just fine! The house is at the intersection of two busier roads, but is on a bigger lot and made it super convenient to get to all the places we wanted to go! We didn’t really use the basement, but there was another living area and two additional bedrooms down there! We would stay again!"

It had everything we needed and had plenty of towels and linens etc. Windows/insulation seemed a bit older but there were AC window units in every room to keep the temperature comfortable. It’s nice having an attached garage as an option to park your vehicle especially with our SD weather. Check in was flawless and easy. Definitely recommend Theresa’s Guesthouse!

Mike's place was the perfect fit for our family to have a clean, comfortable, quiet space where our family could relax and not be bothered by the hustle and bustle of a hotel.
Mike was very responsive and helpful. If you are looking for an upscale place, this is not it. However, if you are looking for a reasonably priced, clean place this will definitely fit the bill. If you are considering Mike's place for a stay, don't hesitate."

Stayed a few nights","Airbnb was a little icky. The house was just old and very outdated. It smelled old and it smelled like pets. There was pee in one of the toilets when we got there and the bathrooms and kitchen were a little smudgy. There were crumbs in the dining room, and the decor was dusty. It was clear that someone had come and cleaned the place (beds were made, carpets were vacuumed, the place was tidy, etc), but they just didn't do that great of a job. And when things are super old and outdated, it often feels a little unclean even if it's not. There were no washcloths, the toaster didn't work, the sponges for doing dishes in the sink were nasty, etc. It just needs some sprucing to function as an airbnb. We asked for new kitchen sponges and the host brought some new ones for us. We asked about washcloths and he said the cleaning lady must not have left any out and that we could ""use whatever hand towel we wanted, no problem""....? The host was very responsive and nice though."

We ran out of toilet paper but it wasn’t a huge deal as we just went and bought a couple rolls. We felt like the housekeeping could have been a little better - lots of smears/smudges that looked like dog slobber on the windows & mirrors, bathroom tub had hair and some goo in it (we didn’t use the standup shower in the bathroom with the washer/dryer - the toilet in this bathroom also had some issues - wouldn’t flush and then overflowed. We just didn’t use it after the first time.) It was nice having a washer/dryer! The location was great and it was an overall good/great place to stay! Thank you!"

Stayed with a pet","The house itself was clean and an amazing place to stay.
We were traveling with our pups so we were looking for somewhere that allowed dogs. Part of what is not included in the house rules in the listing itself is dogs aren’t allowed in bedrooms, which is a good chunk of the house. For some it can be hard to restrict your furry friends from following you. We totally respected this however had we known this all up front we would have not booked as our pups don’t do well in unknown places away from us. We were also asked to vacuum after leaving due to having the pups however we paid a cleaning fee when booking so I was not appreciative of this. It was shared with us that the cleaning fee did not include dog hair removal. However if vacuuming is the form of dog hair removal I wasn’t sure how that differed from something they would do after guests leave anyways.
The home is beautiful and in great location, we didn’t have to communicate with the host on our short stay however they did make themselves available should we have needed them. There are signs around the house to help with rules.
Overall, would recommend if you don’t have pets. Don’t believe this should really be considered pet friendly as there were several stipulations for our pets which made it a little less enjoyable."

We were located on the north end of town which made it easy to get to our hunting areas and if we needed to get any supplies in town it was only a few minutes from the house. The house was clean, comfortable, and well kept with all the basic supplies provided. We were very pleased and would stay again if we do another hunt in the future."

We stayed for a whole week and found it very comfortable. Mike will check in with you to make sure everything is going smoothly and communicates well if there is anything you need.
You won't find a better place for the price. However, if you are looking for a place for an extended stay where you will be cooking and showering a lot, just know that you might need bring a couple items for cooking and all your bathroom toiletries as it is a little light in this area.
Overall, 5 star review!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for a surprise birthday party and impromptu wedding. The house is 3 blocks from a train line that is active around 11-12pm and occasionally 1x/day. I enjoyed it, but bring earplugs if you are concerned. Other than that, the neighborhood is fairly quiet. The house currently doesn't have WiFi but Aberdeen has enough hot spots (coffee shop, restaurants - even McDonald's) to assist. The house has a washer/dryer which is great for extended stays; it's nice to do laundry before re-packing. :)

I was concerned about working with someone that wasn't in Aberdeen (Roger lives in MN) but Roger was always on point with my odd ball requests and I was very comfortable communicating with him (he now knows my crazy family!). Roger was able to accommodate a 1-day early arrival and a 2 day extension for a family member that was having hotel issues. While the house doesn't have WiFi, texting and phoning worked well to contact Roger.

The TV remote wasn't working properly but we barely had time to be in the home to watch anyway. We only had one ""house"" hiccup when the plumbing line needed work because of tree roots interrupting service. but again, Roger was on point and had an action plan within an hour. He even refunded us one day for the inconvenience!

I invited family to tour the house and I envision that others will be contacting Roger for future trips ""home"".

Thanks Roger, for being so gracious and patient. I look forward to contacting you again. :)"

You will have your occasional bugs, but Chad has bug spray, fly swatters, and everything you need to be comfortable. The bed is comfortable and spacious. There is no wifi, BUT Chad stock piled blue ray movies to keep you entertained. There is drip coffee available which tops the scenery. Above all, Chad is responsive, reliable, compassionate and very helpful. When I had an issue, Chad made his cabin available when I needed it the most. That is what makes this a valuable listing- a reliable host who cares for his tenants. Thank you Chad and Allen for going above and beyond for your tenants needs.

Stayed with a pet","Best. AirBnB. Ever. While I am occasionally prone to hyperbole, this was easily the best place we’ve found on AirBnB. The sheer vastness of the surrounding sky and landscape coupled with the total absence of human-generated noise (I think one car drove by?) makes this place truly special.
The micro-cabin itself is the supporting actor. It’s charming, super clean, minimalist, and functionally modern, but for those who are looking to recharge and shed some stress, this is the spot. Soak up the sunset, stars, and sunrise. You won’t be disappointed."

Stayed with a pet","A wonderful place to stay! It has everything you need and the sunrises/sunsets are incredible!! Definitely recommend checking-in during daylight hours, as going in the dark made it very challenging to find. Chad did post a picture in the listing with visual instructions (along with written ones) to help you navigate which were excellent and clear to follow! My dog and I traveled from IL and had a wonderful time. My dog even meet his first cow!! The only challenge was that at nighttime there were A LOT of flies, however, Chad had bug spray already stocked and it certainly helped so much! Would definitely stay again!"

After we arrived, we sat out on the deck and just took in the peaceful surroundings. The owners father came over to introduce himself and let us know where they were (a field or two over) so that if we needed anything, there were people nearby. That definitely made us feel more welcomed and safe. The biggest ""downfall"" was that we were only booked for one night here during a roadtrip. Would definitely stay again!"

It was such a beautiful and peaceful location to crack a beer, grill some brats, listen to all the birds, and watch the sunset over the lake. Chad’s place is really set up with everything you could possibly need as well as Chad being very informative prior to us getting there of things we would maybe want to bring as well as directions on how to get there. This was actually my partner’s and my first time using Airbnb and it couldn’t have been better and gone more smoothly."

Stayed with a pet","This was my final Airbnb stay of a four month road trip & what a lovely finale. I had this place on my wishlist for almost a year. I wanted to wake up with all that light around me and the fields and the sky. And that’s what happened. Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. I sat in that comfortable bed with my coffee and my dog all morning drinking in the outside and the Sounds! I grew up in the Midwest so I know Farm sounds…but these cows have some serious points of view in South Dakota ! And small pheasants just ambling by the windows!
Special thanks to Chad for staying with me on the phone as I got completely turned around and trusted my Apple Maps blindly (tried to feed it the info Chad provided but it led me astray)…better to use the map images Chad provides. But thank you, Chad! I so appreciated your patience. And I got to meet and talk with Chad’s folks as well…a lucky break since in my driving fatigue, I appreciated the reminders to hit the “power button “ for the water pump.
Thank you!"

Chad's dad and mother let us hunt their property and were very nice people to talk to. We did wish the water heating system would have been a little bit more manageable. We were unable to get hot water and the pipes froze overnight due to extreme cold weather. The TV remotes were a bit tricky to figure out with minimal batteries for all of them, but once we figured it out it was the perfect evening in! We would love to revisit in warmer months!"

We wanted a peaceful place to unplug and let our dogs run free without fear of cars or other people - something they can’t do in the city limits. It was everything we wanted and more. The sunsets are beautiful but the stars in the sky are a painting. Chad’s dad welcomed us immediately and gave us the low-down and we didn’t see another human for two days. We couldn’t have asked for a better escape. If you want to unplug and enjoy the long days and the company of your loved ones this is the place for you. Cheers.

We also packed some family DVDs and we comfortably enjoyed movies on the bed. For reference, we had my husband and myself, our 2 year old, and 3 mo old. We were able to setup a portable/travel bassinet (smaller than a pack and play) beside the bed with plenty of room to hang out."

The sunsets looking over it were wonderful from the front porch of the micro-cabin. The accommodations are small (as described) but clean and comfortable. And it was oh so quiet and peaceful.
The owner's father was super friendly, helpful, and available for questions or issues (of which we had none).
We drove a Tesla Model 3 and were able to charge it overnight by plugging it in his 14-50 RV connection.
It was a real treat! One of our favorite stays on a 5 week cross country trip."

The outside of the micro cabin seemed dated due to the fact that it is a different color in person vs what is pictured here. (much darker exterior). The inside was just as described. We will definitely consider rebooking a future date for a quick overnight stop.

We were able to spend lots of time watching the wildlife around this cabin and the birds - there are pheasants everywhere! This place is clean and cleverly put together, it feels so spacious. The deck makes for very nice al fresco dining while waiting for the sunset. The tiny house has water service via a pump you turn on and off, and septic, so it has a full bathroom and and large kitchen sink. A gas cooktop and grill make it easy to cook for yourself. It was super easy to just lounge on the bed with coffee in the morning watching the birds come and go. We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic view from a fantastic tiny home!
Don't let the gravel roads that get smaller and smaller get you lost and miss out. This place is a paradise, location wise. A perfectly private quiet spot with a great view of a lake!
The inside has everything you could ask for! Except maybe satellite internet. But this would be a fantastic place to just get away. Maybe write a book or screenplay. Or just play some board games.
There is a DVD player that I wish we brought some movies for. There was certain moments we wish we had some background movies playing.
Overall this place definitely inspired us to downsize and when we look for a forever home, to not need to have a home with so much space we won't need.
Definitely recommend this place to at least try something different for yourself!"

There was enough room for it after sliding the table over to the bed and stacking the chairs in front of the door. The shower WILL get hot once you figure out how the water cycles through. The gas stove is alittle finicky but adequate. We recommend getting there off the highway by going through Mansfield... taking a backroad can leave you driving around for quite awhile. We’ll likely be back and have recommended it to several friends!

Thoroughly enjoyed hearing the coyotes in the evening. Loved the design and travel notebooks to read/ write in. Space needs a small lamp! We brought our own as we read in a review. Faucet was hot-- shower was room temp even with sink suggestions. Heater worked well on our chilly night and the bed was SUPER comfy. Bring an eye mask if you hope to sleep in as there are no east facing curtains. Will definitely visit again!

VERY dark at night and since two of the windows don’t have shades turning any light on inside made me feel like I was on display (though only 3 cars ever drove by while I was there) so I suggest bringing a small flashlight/lamp if you want just a little light to read in bed, etc. Sitting on the chairs on the porch was beautiful and the house is perfectly placed where you can see sunset on one side and sunrise on the other. I will definitely be back for another personal retreat!"

Stayed one night","We arrived during a rainstorm, so the roads were difficult to navigate. So, be wary of traveling conditions on the way there. Due to the dirt roads being slippery, nearby ponds and ditches off the road, it can be a bit stressful to drive through, while your car slides from side to side. With that being said, the scenic route definitely made up for the inclement weather. The location is perfect for those seeking privacy and seclusion. You’re in a fairly secluded area with a great view of a large pond, livestock, open plains and cornfields in the background. Be wary of tons of bugs come nightfall. They are attracted to the lights and can sneak in, if the door is left open. Don’t expect to have phone service as described, it comes and goes. I would suggest you bring dvd's, books, or anything that can be viewed offline. If you have a hotspot, then this probably wouldn't affect you. The water was a bit tricky to get right at first, given there were instructions. We finally got the shower water running somewhat warm for a quick shower, after fidgeting with the faucet and shower water. It was then that we finally understood the instructions. Basically, you just need to keep the sink faucet running on hot at the same time, while the shower is running. There is a nice bed, TV, DVD player, Apple TV device (no WiFi), towels, shampoo, cooking pots/pans, utensils, two burner stove, and a mini fridge. This place has all of the basic necessities you need. If you can reserve a stay there during clement weather, don’t hesitate to. You'll have a perfect time there, while enjoying the amazing the view."

I met Chad’s father (I told him he has celebrity status on the reviews) who was extremely kind and provided some family history. Saw some spectacular sunrises/sets and the wildflowers provided some great macro photography moments. It was beautiful and idyllic to be in such a remote place and I felt comfortable and safe the entire time. So bring After Bite if you stay in the warmer months and watch for deer at dawn and dusk. Chad is really responsive as well! Can’t say enough positive things about this stay."

Everything was perfect! The view is incredible and it’s so quiet out there.
We had a bit of a difficult time finding the cabin initially from using google maps- use the one Chad sends! I called him and he quickly helped us find the correct road to the cabin.
Chad’s dad met us at the tiny cabin to ensure that we had everything we needed and to give us a couple of easy tips for hot water or to contact them in case of bad weather.
The rest of the evening went so smoothly and the next morning we woke up to gentle rain and could watch the storm pass over the prairie.
The cabin is tiny, but there is so much window space/natural light that it feels like you’re just out in the open the whole tome.
We were doing a cross country trip and it was well worth the drive off the main interstate to get there.
Highly recommend and would definitely stay there again."

The micro cabin is about the size of the trailer so would not recommend for more than a place to sleep. The bed was really comfy so that was the highlight.
There was no hot water for the shower, even with the tip to turn on the hot water in the sink at the same time. The bugs were so bad we couldn't enjoy the front balcony which was the entire reason we had booked the place to begin with."

It was a bit off-roading it (non-paved roads) in my Mini Cooper but it’s seen worse. When I finally found the cute tiny house, chads dad had come out to meet me and walk me through using the controller to turn the water on and off. He mentioned he was right down the street incase anything happened. It stormed really bad that night with high winds that rocked us (my pup and I) a bit side to side but it wasn’t too bad. And being able to see all the lightning along the horizon with those big windows made it worth it! I wish I could have stayed longer and maybe had a clearer night to star gaze."

The cabin provided a nice wind block from the wind that accompanied a storm when it rolled thru.

Stayed one night",Unfortunately we got hit by a storm. Would love to try again when it’s nicer out. The inability to go outside decreases the chem tremendously. Very cold and directions to locate were confusing. Chad was very communicative and made it up to us when we didn’t have any water access. Would try again for sure. Bad luck.

Stayed a few nights","Everything was perfect.
Try and not read to much into the description and comments I'm sure each stay is similar but very different at the same time.
I awoke at 5am to immense fog and could make the shadows out of about 12 deer. Was astounding and breath taking.
Each night the sun sets on the lake across the cabin and the scenery and sounds are jaw dropping.
Worth the drive worth the stay and would love to come.
The locals are friendly the cabin is clean and well stocked and furnished."

The kitchen was lacking some cooking essentials we had to buy a pizza cutter to eat our dinner, needs more serving utensils and dishes, a set scissors and paper and pen would have been a nice addition and a dust pan (couldn't find a dust pan). There were not any house rules or instructions left in the room. I was hoping for a streaming service to watch TV with, and there was nothing on the TVs. Overall, it was a good apartment for our family, we would stay again. Thank you."

Stayed with kids","Pros: spacious rooms, closets, bathrooms. Nice kitchen appliances. New/clean feel. Central A/C. Comfortable beds. Good communication from Luke. Flexible check out which was a HUGE help to us.
Cons: very poorly stocked kitchen, which was completely unexpected, so we were ill-prepared. 3 saute pans, a set of 4 dishes (bowls, medium and large plates), forks/spoons/table knives, glasses, a pizza tray, and 2 cutting boards. NO pots, can opener, sharp knives larger bowls for serving/mixing, etc. This meant we couldn't make use of food we had pre-prepared (and needed to be heated in a pot) nor food we brought to prepare there. Also no salt/pepper/essential cooking staples. Only 1 dishwasher soap packet, so we washed a lot by hand (after I bought dish soap). I suspect this unit may be set up more as a temporary rental while they try to sell it?? Great place if you are looking to buy!!"

The house was quite comfortable, and it would have received a full five star review if weren't for the fact that the pillows were rather flimsy, a problem you never find in hotels.
Still, the circumstances of our trip made the house the perfect place for family from afar to gather and spend time together.
The cost was higher than one might expect in Aberdeen, but the hotels were full that weekend, so that might have affected the price.
All in all, we would consider staying there again."

If you have more, including some kiddos, it would still be plenty of space. Natalie and Nicole are awesome hosts!! Gave great recommendations for dinner and even for other the places to where we were traveling. As an added bonus, there is a Caribou Coffee down the street!"

Stayed a few nights","The place is great! Good location, and a nice, quaint house.
My crew and I stayed at the place, and the ONLY complaints we had are:
1. The WiFi can’t handle over 5 devices (but we are all super tech savvy, so that’s more our fault than anything)
2. There isn’t a TV in every room (I would assume because it would overload the router)
HOWEVER, the TV in the living room is great, and there’s plenty of space for everyone to hang out and watch TV.
Would definitely stay again, the place was super clean, and looked to be remodeled very well!
We even got some cookies baked for us that were GREAT"

The dining room table comfortably fits 8. The showers had good pressure. Everything went great. Nicole is super easy to get a hold of, really open to questions, and extremely friendly.
