Group trip","What a wonderful long weekend that we had celebrating our son's graduation. The house was absolutely perfect. There were so many great things about the house from the comfortable bedding and linens, to the well stocked kitchen and dining area, to the comfortable sofas & chairs, and to our favorite -the wrap around porch. It was a just amazing! Thank you for everything you did to make this a great celebration in your beautiful home one we will never forget. We will definitely come back again!"

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful experience staying here. Extremely clean, easy access, beautiful place. The history of the home is incredible and Julie has done a great job with a book describing the house's history and how it came to be as it is today. Bed's were comfortable and clean, rooms were nicely sized, beautiful historic character, and this house is close to EVERYTHING. Within a couple minutes to tons of restaurants, and right across the street from the Natural History Museum, and down the street from Piedmont Arts Center.
Would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Martinsville area."

There is a full bathroom with walk-in shower on the first floor, too. There is one full bathroom upstairs that the 2nd floor three bedrooms share.
The kitchen is well stocked with spices,seasonings, pots, and pans.
All the beds and pillows are comfortable,which is no small feat for Airbnbs.
We hope to stay here again next year."

Group trip","This was our second stay at Julie’s charming, comfortable, immaculate house. The house was well-stocked with all of the little extras we needed, and as an added bonus, it was decorated for Christmas when we arrived on Dec. 27! There was plenty of room for our family, and we enjoyed being walking distance to Martinsville’s uptown district (daily morning walks to get coffee and breakfast at The Ground Floor were a must!). We’ll definitely be staying at Julie’s house on our next visit to Martinsville."

Once inside we found the house to be very suitable for our stay. There was plenty of room for a large party to spread out and not feel cramped. There is a full kitchen with all the utensils, pots, pans, etc.
The bedrooms are all upstairs and very comfortable. Bonus: there is an arcade machine in the upstairs TV room!
If you are traveling to Martinsville with family, this is the perfect place to stay. We will definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","""Starling Place is probably the best Airbnb we've ever stayed at and here's why....The Martinsville location is excellent. It is centrally located and easily accessible. There is plenty of parking from the circular driveway in front to the two car driveway in the back with garage/back door access. The house itself is beautiful and welcoming! The access code worked perfectly. The house was so charming! (solid wood doors with glass handles, shining hardwood floors, broad staircase, gorgeous light fixtures) It had the timeless feel of a classic home with all of the comfortable, modern updates. The best part was the obvious concern for guests' comfort. The home was impeccably clean! The bathrooms had fluffy white towels galore AND a stack of beach style towels in the laundry room. The showers had dispensers for shampoo, conditioner and bodywash."

Stayed a few nights","We couldn’t have asked for a better stay at an air bnb to go see a local music festival. The most interesting part of this air bnb is the pieces of art scattered throughout the home. I appreciated the activities and games provide such as the retro arcade games. Great stay especially for the price! It’s so unfair how pricey hotels and even air bnbs can be, Julie is not only fair, but very kind and was easy to communicate with! Thank you again :) we hope to be in the area again and will book this stay!"

We enjoyed sitting on the spacious and comfortable porch in between our comings and goings in the area, then retiring to rest in the accommodating beds. There was ample room and an equally inviting ethos of hospitality.
Our every need was met or exceeded. The house was perfect for our Family Reunion events & guests.
Thank you for an outstanding stay,

Stayed with kids","This was by far the best place weve ever stayed. The home was more than we were expecting. Its absolutly beautiful and the energy there felt the same as my grandparents house in upstate NY. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud... I hit the bed and didnt wake up until my alarm went off ( which never happens) There was more than enough amenities needed to go around, and we didnt need anything for our stay. There was plenty of places to sleep so the kids had different options. The only thing I wish I had done differently was book it for a few more nights. Definity will be my go to place to stay for now on when visiting Martinsville."

The only thing we expected to use which did not work out was the drip coffee maker; there was no decanter. However, there was also a Keurig machine, along with plenty of pods and other coffee supplies. I would definitely stay here again if I needed a space with multiple bedrooms."

Stayed a few nights","We loved this beautiful house! It is even better than the pictures, very clean, comfortable and so much space. We needed a place near Eden for the week and it was only a 30 minute drive. I worked from the house, the office was a perfect set up. I didn’t have to bring an extra monitor, keyboard or mouse. The WIFI was a bit spotty but wasn’t a disruption for my meetings, if it disconnected it reconnected quickly.
So many extras available in the kitchen, shampoo and conditioner in the showers. Beds are super comfy, towels were extra fluffy. We loved drinks on the porch each evening, did puzzles in the front sitting area, played arcade games in the yellow room. Would definitely come back and recommend to anyone!"

We visit Martinsville several times a year to see family and have always stayed at a hotel but this time we decided to try an airbnb property and we are so glad we did. This property has all the nice touches that I have come to expect with airbnb. The Home Guide had a wonderful history of the house as well as all the other info you need. We definitely felt like we were staying with family. Loved the big fluffy towels and bed linens! We will definitely be back. Thanks for such a cozy stay.

Julie's house offered everything we needed and so much more (e.g., some helpful perishables and non-perishables in the kitchen, first aid kit and hair products in the bathroom). We had so much fun going across the street to the natural history museum with the kids. And we were able to walk or drive (in under 10 minutes) to a park, a restaurant, and a coffee shop. We also enjoyed visiting Greensboro, North Carolina which was about an hour away. Julie's house was a haven to us this weekend and we know it will be for you, too!"

Stayed with a pet","An excellent stay. We had a bumpy road at the beginning on our side. This was a work trip and one of our travelers got exposed to Covid the day before we were suppose to leave. Julie was extremely responsive and accommodating to our situation while we worked out a new schedule and workers to come out. She graciously accepted our change of dates and change of guests which helped us keep our revised work schedule. The place was wonderful to stay in, conveniently located to the downtown area which is where we need to be. There was a random power outage on Wednesday morning, and Julie again was right on top of things for us as far as getting in touch with the power company and seeing how long the repair time would be. We were quite comfortable in the house and it had every amenity we needed. We can't thank Julie enough for a great stay and accommodating manner. We look forward to our next trip to Martinsville and will be hopefully staying here again. Thank you!"

With this house you get the best of both old and new....this 100 year old house has been restored (including home automation features) but still has that old charm...would definitely come back again.

Stayed about a week","Julie's house is in a great location in Martinsville. For families with dogs, there is a park within walking distance and the neighborhood is very dog friendly for casual walks. The view of the church and the stained glass windows across the street is gorgeous. The home is very comfortable. If you need to work while there, the desk in the office is a great plus. For us, the home was much larger than we needed for 2 people and our dog. But, for our travel needs, it was the perfect location, dog friendly and among the few in the area that take the extra care needed for cleaning during Covid. Sadly, we didn't have time in our schedule to enjoy the upstairs den and arcade game, or the lovely wrap around front porch. These features would make it the perfect place for a getaway with friends or a family gathering.
Besides being clean and safe during Covid, one of the most important things for us was a kitchen good for cooking big meals that we could deliver to nearby family members. The kitchen is an odd layout, but it worked very well for us. It's very well stocked and has good quality cooking pans. We personally have a focus on natural foods and healthy eating, and we don't use cookware that has chemical non stick coatings, etc. We have found that many nice Air BnB's have crappy cookware and the coatings are scratched, making them even more toxic. For long trips, we've started taking a few of our own kitchen items to make things easier. In advance, Julie assured me that her kitchen was well stocked for our needs and that we didn't need to bring our own. She did not disappoint!
Julie's communication before our stay and during was prompt and professional. When we had a family emergency and needed to extend our stay, she accommodated us. BUT, she wasn't willing to compromise the safety of the next guests and only allowed us to stay the amount of time that she would have time to air the house out for the proper time before the next arrival. That made it harder for us, but we really appreciated that she did the right thing---and she offered to help us find another place for the additional days we needed.
Highly recommend this stay!"

As soon as we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Anita. She explained everything to us and the guidelines were clear. She always addresses us with a smile. We don't speak English very well but it was easy to communicate with Anita.
We had booked the bedroom with ensuite bathroom. The room was remarkably clean and so was the bathroom. We had everything at our disposal. It was exactly as the photos. This was our first airbnb experience and we are delighted."

Stayed a few nights","Anita & Denny offer welcome southern hospitality. we stayed 3 nights for a music festival and they never made us feel badly about coming g and going late in the evening.
We were treated to some awesome live music from the pair and learned a bit about their musical background. Everything went smoothly and the spaces both public and private were sparkling clean. I gave an overall 5 stars based on the room and amenities as expected from reading the space description. the room was quiet and secure. They provided a comfy bed with 2 pillow choices, additional box of snacks which in my opinion sets a host apart. A few dollars invested in the guest is so thoughtful when guests arrive and may be hungry without the opportunity to hit a market in a new area. Well done Anita.
Plenty of street parking.
Older bathroom/interior but as stated, sparkling clean and great water pressure in the shower of the ensuite bathroom off our room. They have multiple rooms available. The room included fridge, microwave and a basket of kitchen supplies truly making our stay a breeze.
We will definitely stay here again. Probably missed some things but easy communication so just ask Anita if you have questions before staying."

Their years of managing a “real” BnB ( for those of us old enough to remember) means that they know how to serve without limits and with a joyous heart. Their place is exactly as described. Every amenity. Special touches abound. But mostly Danny and Anita are there at your service ready to enhance your stay in whatever way you might enjoy. We were there for our anniversary, and they asked if they could sing a couple of special songs for us in honor of our anniversary which we gladly accepted. How many hosts have you had in your Airbnb experience who have pulled out the guitar and autoharp and sang in your honor. This was our first, and you can see that we have been to a few Airbnb’s."

Stayed a few nights","We wanted to love our stay, but it wasn’t great.
We were woken up by people mowing and weed whacking right outside our bedroom windows; they were carelessly mowing around our rental car, too, possibly kicking up damaging debris. It was extremely alarming to have unexpected people on the property, especially since we’re not familiar with Martinsville. I messaged the host to see if they expected people to be on the property. Their response was, “They are on a schedule and do it as available. We talked to them yesterday, they didn’t give us a firm date…I’m sorry, but it’s the time of the year.” I understand that the lawn may need to be mowed while guests are occupying the property, but the host should have given us a heads up that random people may show up on the property during our stay.
Some details of the home also pose a threat to guests’ safety (e.g., electrical outlet in living room popped out of the wall), and the house could have been cleaner (e.g., bathroom walls were dirty)."

Stayed a few nights","I’ve used AirBnB many times and this was the worst. I rented here to have use of the washer and dryer which was non existent. The front porch was so dark I had to use a flashlight to open the key lock box and unlock the door. There were three keys. When I wasn’t able to get in I called the hostess. She was not helpful and argued there was plenty of light from the pole. When I told her that was not accurate she argued stating all the keys worked fine and that she doesn’t turn on the porch light. She said there was nothing she could do about it as she was 2 1/2 hours away. Then she said she’d see if she could get someone there to help me. It was about 32 degrees and a wind was blowing. I continued to try to unlock the locks. One key finally worked and I called to let her know. She told me I was rude.
The water pressure was so bad nor was it hot enough to take a shower.
The temperature was set at 65 and all the curtains were pulled back. It was very cold inside."

The host sent over easy to follow directions and had them posted on the fridge. I throughly enjoyed the home. The beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows and extra throw blankets in each room. Had basic necessities for cooking such as pots, pans, plates, bowls, utensils, measuring cups, and drinking glasses. It had a sponge and dishwasher pods. It brought a level of peace while being in the area for an unfortunate situation. I highly recommend this property and I look forward to interacting with the host in the future if I need to return to the area."

Stayed a few nights","Cute house, recently remodeled, nicely decorated, and very clean. I arrived around 9:00 p.m. and felt a little uncomfortable with a few things right away. 1) very dark outside with no light except the front porch light; 2) grass next to the house was about a foot high; 3) no covering over the window at the kitchen door or the windows over the sink. Someone could have seen into the living room, kitchen, and partially down the hallway from the kitchen door window; 4) when I sat on the bed and then got up it creaked very loudly. I stayed a couple of hours and decided I would be more comfortable at a hotel. This was my first Airbnb experience, and, being a woman traveling alone, I may not have chosen the right kind of place (for me). However, the host was very accommodating and was going to consider a power pole outside and agreed to put blinds on the window of the kitchen door. Issue was reasonably resolved ."

Our group could not stop saying amazing things about this lovely well furnished and appointed home!! All of us would be happy return and stay there again.

It was the perfect place for a group of Marines and their wives to reconnect. We had a couple 51 years together and one married less than 2 years. it provided privacy and numerous places for the group to gather.

On arrival you will be impressed with the street view and landscaping, both were beautiful! The curved driveway could easily fit several cars, and the home is located on a very quiet street.
Simply put, the home is huge and was very clean, it provided us with lots of space to spread out and relax, both inside and out. There was an assortment of chocolates and snacks throughout the house and a very large welcome tray in each of the bedrooms, we felt pampered from the moment we opened the door.
The kitchen was stocked with every plate, glass, knife and appliance you could image. The prep station next to it was home to coffee and tea center, housing a variety of coffees and teas.

Our family truly enjoyed our stay, but what made it that more special to us, was the kindness and hospitality of the host and team, they truly were amazing! Thank you, again!"

Stayed with kids","When you make a reservation for an Airbnb, sometimes the description and pictures can be misleading but that was not the case with this home. What you see is definitely what you get. We were in town for my son's wedding and we had at least 8 family members staying at the home with us. It accommodated us all. Wish we could have spent more time at the house. Would definitely stay there again."

Group trip","I rented Leland’s place for my family to stay at over our wedding weekend. My family LOVED IT! It allowed us enough space to get away when we were tired but ultimately we camped out in the dinning room around the table. We shared stories, laughed, and prepared wedding collateral. All I can say is if you have a large group and you’re in martinsville it’s amazing. I’ve never stayed anywhere quite like it. Hats off hosts! You’ve got a diamond. I wish you many years of helping other’s experience something that you don’t get at an average airbnb."

This place provided everyone privacy and a place to come together when we wanted. The trays of snack and water were pretty much a life saver when getting in late from delayed flights. Kitchen is fully stocked with plenty of dishes and spices. Fridge hosted cold sodas and water. I will deff recommend this place to friends, family, and coworkers. Thanks"

Kobie was wonderful. He met me at the house for a walk through a week or so before family arrived and was able to provide much appreciated flexibility as to check in and check out times. My family was very happy with every aspect of the house."

Stayed with kids","This home was truly extraordinary. Our kids asked ""is this a mansion?"" more than once. It is enormous, and every bit of the space is beautifully decorated and built with a quality and care that I think would be hard to find in any new construction today. I think a high point might have been when I sat reading in the library while my wife and in-laws played the grand piano in the next room. The yard was also a lot of fun for the kids to walk around and play in, and everything was comfortable and welcoming. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially larger groups who need space to spread out."

Group trip","Wonderful experience! Had our large family Thanksgiving dinner here and it was so perfect! Tons of space, kitchen had everything we needed including plenty of wine glasses, coffee cups and great variety of k-cups, every spice we could think of and plenty of all dishes. Bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedding so luxurious feeling! The little touches like a welcome platter on each bed with all kinds of snacks, chocolates, bottled water, etc. just show how much care Kobie puts into making guests feel welcomed. We loved the outdoor seating spaces too including the fire pit & back yard/porch.
Several of us had many Airbnb experiences and this one was the BEST! I’ve been to properties with on-site hosts and didn’t love it BUT, having Kobie in the downstairs area was hardly even noticeable and he TOTALLY gave us our space. He was even nice enough to assist with a family photo but then we didn’t see him again but he was quick to answer messages if we needed anything. Can’t say enough about ow happy we were with this property and we really hope we can do again!"

Kitchen was well stocked, close to my home kitchen, it had everything we needed to cook a meal for 12. All the beds were super comfortable.

Inside and around the property because it has beautiful landscaping. So the house is perfect for a big group with room to spare. We appreciated all/most of the rooms had their own bathroom and the large sitting area downstairs. Highly recommend checking this place out."

Group trip","Our stay at 214 Oakdale was an enjoyable experience with my extended family and friends. The pictures used to describe the property accurately reflected the location. Even-though the home was large with a number of rooms, it felt cozy that allowed for privacy if one desired that. We enjoyed the many windows that provide good lighting during the day. The house was generally clean, yet some of the windows were dirty. The back porch was a favorite meeting spot for AM coffee or evening congregations. The kitchen was well supplied with dishes/utensils, plus a Keurig coffee maker was a bonus. We did have some challenges to find a comfortable setting for the A/C to balance between both floors. The humidity in the house was high that explains the number of humidifiers in the house. We could not get any of the TV’s to show or play programming since it required us to subscribe to a Roku account that we were uncomfortable doing. This was disappointing since the TVs in the bedrooms would have been nice to use. Overall we rated the stay a 4 of 5 and would likely stay again with minor adjustments."

Everything from the cleanliness of the home, the tasteful decor and thoughtfulness of the hosts, I could not be more satisfied with our stay! I will 110% be returning! BOOK THIS OASIS NOW you will not regret it! 5 stars is not a high enough rating for Frank and Alesia’s home! The pictures do not do this beautiful retreat justice! You can tell they put their own sweat and tears into making this an amazing experience and it was worth every penny we spent!"

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay at the Oasis guesthouse. It is decorated nicely and the furniture is comfy. The views from the back deck are gorgeous and there is a table and chairs on the deck making it great for enjoying a beverage. Although there is no true kitchen, there is a working microwave, coffee bar with Keurig, small fridge, kitchen sink with countertops, and a few dishes. My only complaint is that the only available plates aren't microwavable so we couldn't reheat leftovers. We chose to have the pool heated since we enjoy warm dips in cold weather. It was perfect for us even though its not hot tub temperature. Getting toasty in the water and then stepping out into the cold air felt sooooo good!For future travelers I will say that there are two levels to this guesthouse, and all sleeping quarters downstairs. Also, the gate that has to be opened to enter the exterior guest area is pretty heavy, so anyone with mobility issues should be aware of these two things about the property."

Stayed a few nights","Frank’s place was lovely- a beautiful space to relax and decompress. Unfortunately, in order to know what you’re getting, you have to look at the fine lines. Amenities that are listed include a hot tub, kitchen, dryer, washer, hot water kettle…. All of these were either completely missing (washer and dryer) or checked but not as advertised. Frank has a beautiful heated pool with a splash pad- what is advertised on the listing as a hot tub. When getting the welcome manual, it clarifies that the splash pad “doubles” as a hot tub- when it is neither deep enough (maybe 10 inches in depth) nor hot enough to fit the definition. The kitchen consists of a microwave, toaster, and small fridge. Pots and pans are advertised- but no cooking appliance is present to be able to cook anything, aside from an outdoor grill, of which these pans would be useless. This would have been a 5-star review, if it were not for the feeling that we had been misled by the list of amenities that were advertised."

Stayed with a pet","5 STARS!!! We truly had a magical stay at the Oasis of Martinsville! The pool was absolutely divine, with a waterfall, massage jets, and a splash pad. It was also very clean and, while in the back yard of the hosts' house, still felt very private. There are large trees throughout, which provided some shade, which was great for the dogs. Yet, the pool got lots of sunlight—we both came back with suntans!
The guest house was spotless and well-appointed. The decor was lovely, and the bed linens were high-quality. While the kitchen is more like a kitchenette, it worked totally well for us. The fridge (and freezer) is bigger than it looks, and we brought our own air fryer for baking.
It was so relaxing just being able to float around the gorgeous pool while our dogs frolicked in the fenced back yard. The hosts were friendly, communicative, and left clear instructions for us. We would 100% return and recommend the Oasis to others!"

It was a little chilly outside at night, but the heated pool made it enjoyable to be outside at night. Frank and Alesia are very responsive and happy to help! Be aware that on some humid days the dehumidifier would occasionally come on and be noisy, but other than that it was fine. I can't wait for the next visit!"

The outdoor space was amazing. Our kids were in the Salt water pool for hours. The fireplace was nice at night and we were even able to watch TV. the indoor space was beautifully decorated and every detail was thought of. The only thing I would change, is having a washer and dryer in the unit. The hosts were great as well. When in the area again, this will be where we will be staying!"

Thankfully Frank pointed us to places to get swimsuits and we were able to enjoy the pool the entire weekend. He and Alesia are super-responsive and answered all of our questions quickly. We liked it so much, we booked another visit before we had even left."

There was another queen bed and a twin bed that were in the bedroom downstairs. We enjoyed the gorgeous pool and the relaxing deck. The rental was equipped with everything we needed. WE drove about an hour to the Blue Ridge Parkway to explore some of it. We explored a little around the area and just relaxed and swam quite a bit for a long weekend. This is one of my favorite Airbnb or VRBO rentals, I would love to return, and I highly recommend it. 5 stars, for sure."

Stayed with kids","The Oasis was just as advertised…an oasis. From the beautiful pool and surrounding wooden fence, to the beautifully decorated guest house, The Oasis did not disappoint. The neighborhood is quiet and gorgeous with tons of older trees which really added to the secluded feel of The Oasis. We loved spending time in the pool which we chose not to heat since the weather was already pretty warm. Unfortunately, there was lots of rain during our stay but we didn’t mind too much as the guest house provided a comfortable hang out spot. And while there was lots of rain, there was plenty of breaks in the weather that allowed us to enjoy the pool. We even went out for a couple of evening swims. We had the fortunate experience to see a family of deer, through the sliding glass doors that lead to the deck, as we enjoyed breakfast. We are looking forward to another stay at The Oasis."

From the get go, Frank and Alesia were fantastic with communication; they were willing to answer any questions we had, and their responses came almost immediately. They provided a very in-depth guide that was useful and appreciated. They were such terrific hosts! The Oasis was truly that- an oasis. While the pictures were accurate, they didn’t do the Airbnb justice. The guest house was just the right size and had everything we needed, including plenty of pool towels. It was quite cozy yet had all the modern conveniences; we loved the huge amount of tv apps to choose from. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and we all slept like babies. The views out back were gorgeous, and the location was easy to find and was very quiet and peaceful, even though it is within quick access to restaurants, stores, etc. We appreciated the lighting and security; we felt safe inside and outside of the guest house while on the property. We were also grateful for the large numbers/locations of outlets to charge devices. The pool was our favorite feature and where we spent the most time. We loved that it can be heated, and it is very pleasing aesthetically. Thank you for such a wonderful time! We look forward to visiting again!"

We can not thank you enough for our getaway this weekend which was fantastic. The Ya Ya sisters had such a great time away which was much needed for all of us Nurses. Your home was beautiful and all of the accomodations and amentities were spot on and excellent. The pool was perfect and warm for the coolness of the day and evening. The outside sitting area by the pool had everthing that you could possibly need to relax and enjoy the day and evening with the fireplace, TV, wine cooler and grill. We appreciated your hospitality in checking in with us as well, making sure we didnt need anything and always making sure we had enough towels and that we were having a good time!
Great getaway for families, friends and couples for sure.
Thanks again Ms. M Palmer😊"

Stayed with kids","This place was beyond what we can think of as available at one single Airbnb. It was like the greatest parts of all the resorts and Airbnbs we have ever been to across the world in the last 15 yrs. Whoever did the decorating made the place look fabulous. The guidebook was very nice and great to have electronic version. I didn’t meet Frank, but he was a very attentive host. We enjoyed the warm pool and I think our hosts even set out bug spray for us while we were out at dinner in anticipation of us possibly using the outdoor area in the evening.
We were very grateful that this family has chosen to host guests and share their incredible oasis with travelers.
Thanks again!"

Stayed with kids","This was a fantastic stay! I have to point out the bedrooms are downstairs from the bathroom and living space for little children or handicap to consider. This is mentioned and we did fine but a consideration. Everything was sparkling clean! The kitchenette worked fine for us as I brought microwavable foods and we cooked burgers on the grill, had sandwiches and such. The owners guide includes suggested local restaurants as well but we didn't have a need to leave with everything provided. There are too many amenities to name! If you forget shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc... It was there. The owners made sure the temperature for the home and the pool was adjusted to our comfort upon arrival. The fenced in private yard truly felt like our own oasis! I thought it would feel weird being in someone's back yard but it did not as the owners made sure you felt like you were in a private space. They were also very responsive when we messaged with a question. In all my only regret was the traffic and time that made us arrive late. We truly wished we had more time there to enjoy our stay."

Stayed with a pet","What a great stay! The house was super clean and smelled amazing! The decor was beautiful and the couches and beds were very comfortable. I also really appreciated the attention to small details that Frank and his wife put into the Airbnb like providing bath supplies incase their guest forgot soaps or toothpaste. I also really appreciated that they provided travel contact cleaner w/ case kits for guests who have forgotten that stuff. Although I didn’t need it this trip, I have been in the predicament where I forgot to pack it and don’t realize it until I’m getting ready for bed. Frank was an awesome host who had the pool heated up and ready for us when we got there and was quick to respond/help out when we thought we locked ourselves in the pool area. Overall an amazing experience, would recommend it to anyone who is considering, and would love to come back 😊"

Stayed one night","I had a great time, however, I recommended they update their page because the projector is broken. It's winter so I thought it would be cool to watch movies in the heated pool. They recommended I turn on a movie in the outdoor lounge area, but the TV doesn't face the pool so I'd have to sit in the cold lol... I recommend others have a car but it wasn't an issue at all for me because there's little stores nearby and I stayed at the house most of the time... The heated pool itself was perfect! I was bummed the projector was broken and I wasn't given instructions on how to turn on the outdoor fireplace... Other than that, the guesthouse was clean!"

When we arrived, the pool was heated and the kids immediately jumped in - so fun to be able to do in December! We enjoyed the pool and then the outdoor fire/lounging area. Everything is well stocked and they provided so much information about the property and the area. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. We had to leave early unexpectedly and Frank was very understanding and gracious. Then to top it off, we left something behind and he offered to deliver it or mail it back to us. The kindness was much appreciated. We hope to return again soon!"

The heated pool and the grill is amazing, and I also enjoyed hoopping at the backyard. TV and WiFi are great for watching Christmas sports event and movies. Frank is a very considerate host. He helped us turn on the heater for the pool before we arrived and hence we could have enjoyed the short afternoon asap. Definitely would recommend to big families."

Stayed with kids","The Oasis of Martinsville! The name says it all…. From the minute you walk into the gate you are truly in an Oasis that’s all yours! Our stay here was phenomenal! The pool and outside area are fantastic and so relaxing, even on cool fall days we were able to enjoy the heated saltwater pool until late at night. The lights around the patio and pool area give it an added touch of relaxation and fun. The inside of the Oasis is also amazing, the host have thought of everything and it’s so clean and has a comfy right at home feel to it. It’s a super cozy area and we couldn’t have asked for more. This place is very private and it really feels like your own little slice of heaven! Communication with Frank was super easy and he answered every question in a timely fashion and helped out with everything we needed. Frank even went out early in the morning to make sure the pool was being heated so when we were ready to swim it was ready and warm for us, I was unsure about turning on the gas fireplace so Frank took care of that as well for us. They go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need while staying here! Frank and Alesia are spectacular host and have done an incredible job with their Oasis! While your staying there it feels like it’s your own private spot to relax and hang out with family and friends. My chocolate lab Jeter also loved it! He enjoyed running around outside and even taking a dip in the pool as well! For me the fact they welcome pets here makes it even more perfect. If 10 stars were possible on Airbnb Frank and Alesia and the Oasis would earn every single one… this place is awesome as are the host! We can’t wait to go back again and spend more time here! So happy they shared their Oasis with us!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a fabulous time. The owners were spot on with communication. Every question was answered right away through the Airbnb site. We felt this was our very own getaway. Our Greyhound loved it as well. Just walking minutes to the lake. The trail was such a wonderful way to see the fall foliage. The trail went completely around the lake. A fantastic 2 mile walk. Oasis is the perfect name for this immaculate gem. Our weather had a low temperature of 28, unusually cold in the morning in Virginia, so the outside has fireplace was a perfect way to enjoy the outdoors. A week earlier we would have been able to use the beautiful heated pool. But with the lights around the pool and the waterfall it was very tranquil despite the cold. Thank you. We would highly recommend this venue. The owners were amazing. So many little unexpected accommodations. We would love to return in the spring or summer. Thank you."

Just as advertised... lovely 2BR/1B that is new and fresh all around. Very well stocked with everything you need for a short or a lengthy stay. The location is in a nice residential neighborhood, but the neighbors are not right on top of one another. It's quiet, but in close proximityto anything you need... food, shops, speedway, fishing, hunting... very convenient location.

The place was really clean. The kitchen area, bathroom area, bedroom area, were all very clean. This Really made me feel at home.
I didn't have to worry about parking, there was a garage to park inside of, or I could park outside in the driveway with plenty of room.
I recommend this place to anyone who was looking for a comfortable, clean place, with lots of quiet time.
In my opinion, this was an excellent stay. I am looking forward to staying there again in the near future.

I’ll recommend this place to anyone who comes to the Henry County/Martinsville area. I’ll definitely look forward to coming back home in the upcoming weeks if this place is available. Also, Elizabeth is a great host she was quick to respond, and did a wonderful job with the interior of the home. If there were 10 stars on the rating scale this would definitely get a 10 from me."

Host responded immediately and coached me right to where I needed to be. Place is beautifully decorated and well equipped. I would recommend to anyone. I would have extended longer if it had been available. Hope everyone else enjoys it as I have. 👍"

This is definitely a 5 star bnb! I like the option to be able to park my car in the garage. This place is spectacular. The shower and king bed was my favorite! The shower is huge and has a fancy option to use 2 shower heads at the same time! It was truly like a spa experience. I slept amazing with the comfy bed! This place is decorated with elegance, no clutter and it’s spacious!
Everything was perfect about this stay. We felt like we were royalty staying here! No joke haha but it was listed at such a great price! Thank you for not charging a cleaning fee and allowing to have pets (even though we didn’t bring ours). I wish I could of stayed longer. I look forward to visiting again!

It is an older home so the only minor issue we had is the bedroom doors were creaking and a little hard to shut. If someone tries to close it, it can sound like the door is slamming in the middle of the night. Other than that, everything was absolutely amazing. We would definitely stay here again.

But if you would like a place to stay with a kitchen this one has everything you need.
I really appreciate the fact that Lauren has Netflix account turned on most places do not and then I have to add one my accounts to watch TV. This is the little things that make a stay better. Thank you, Lauren. I will be back soon."

Stayed a few nights","Yard unsightly with tile debris, tall grass, overgrown bushes and such, ice maker was broken (I had to ask as well as ask for my key code), description said supplied coffee but not nearly enough for the four planned guest for two nights, perfectly horrible couch to sit on (can’t imagine anyone sleeping on it), trees had been cut down in the back yard and left there.
Positives: Comfortable beds, bathroom water pressure good. Friendly neighbors.
Not sure who dropped all of the balls here and I do hope they can get it right but no, I do not recommend, and I am baffled nor by all of the positive reviews for this one. I feel misled and made my choice on them. Not a good weekend hosting my family for her birthday and first trip to the Ville😞

The rooms only have two prongs, it maybe a little challenging for some electric devices that have 3 prongs but I was able to connect the devise in the kitchen with no issues. There is no iron but the host has a steamer that worked just as well. The TV has an option for you to sign into your Netflix, Hulu and Prime. YouTube was available.
The host was great responding and gave us suggestions for local restaurants; Yamato was a win. The stay was a good value for the price. We could definitely stay here again when we come back."

There aren’t many hotels (nice ones anyway) in the area and honestly we paid the same price for this cute house that we would have paid for a small hotel room plus we got to stay together. Lauren was so amazing and friendly, sending her condolences and even asking after our checkout if there was anything she could do. If we are in town again, I’d love to stay here. Thank you Lauren for sharing your home and kindness with us, making events of the weekend a little easier for us to attend on such short notice."

The place was great, quiet, exactly what we were looking for in an overnight getaway. The downtown is very walkable and highly recommend The Ground Floor coffee shop while there."

The bed was comfortable and the little apartment had everything we needed located in a peaceful and beautiful neighborhood just minutes away from the hospital and local restaurants.
Josh and Morgan were absolutely amazing hosts! They allowed us very flexible check in and checkout in order to spend more time with my father in law. This was so incredibly kind of them and they offered it without us asking them. So thoughtful! Thank you so much for a wonderful stay and despite the sad occasion we felt right at home! Would definitely stay again and recommend highly without hesitation !"

Stayed a few nights","The place was tidy and cozy, and the bed was comfortable. However, there were a lot of small things that were missing or off.
The bathroom: no floor mat when you get out of the shower. There is also no curtain on the bathroom window which made my wife a little concerned.
The Kitchen: There was no ice in the freezer part of the refrigerator – only a filthy, empty ice tray. Also, the instructions asked that you wash your dishes but they do not offer a sponge or tool to do so. You are also asked to sign the Guest Book – but there was none.
Coffee – They offer K-cups but do not have sugar or any type of creamer option.
We were in the area for a funeral. That meant that I brought hanging garments. There is no place to hang clothes except on the towel holders in the bathroom.
Air conditioner was difficult to operate. Batteries may have been dying."

Morgan & Josh have thought of it all with an AC unit that keeps the apartment super cool, heater in the bathroom for colder nights/mornings, Keurig w K-cups plus more. We had plenty of space to park two cars as well. Would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",Pristine place and helpful hosts who are very responsive while respecting your privacy. Excellent for one or two people and really one of the nicest options on air bnb in the area. Pictures match the experience. We also had a family emergency come up that caused us to cancel a second reservation with then and they were extremely understanding and kind. Would highly recommend.

Stayed with a pet","What an absolutely cozy, stylish and relaxing space that Morgan and Josh have.
Their communication with instructions prior to my arrival was so helpful and they made it known I could reach out if I needed anything.
The space itself is wonderful. A super comfortable bed, great water pressure in the shower and a full kitchen.
The check-in was easy and parking right in front.
Highly recommend this space and would definitely return if I’m passing through Martinsville in the future."

Stayed one night","The GPS may end you up in a few different private driveways so look for a brick house with deep full front porch. The driveway is shared with a house on the right. The guest house in at the back of the driveway with parking directly in front of the guest house which is very convenient. The space is set up well, very cute inside, and extremely clean. There is a Keurig but bring cream and sugar if you take it with your coffee. The fridge was well stocked with water"

Stayed a few nights","Morgan's carriage house/guest house was comfortable and stylish. There were thoughtful gestures, like cold bottled water and yummy coffee. The house is located on a charming street, and is near the Natural History Museum and uptown area. We plan to stay again the next time we are in Martinsville."

Stayed with a pet","The Blue Door is a cozy, immaculate and well done space. I was Josh and Morgan's first guest and they knocked it out of the park! Such thoughtful and attentive hosts.
With downtown being walkable (under 20 minutes) and the beautiful wooded area out back, you get the perfect mix of accessibility and peace and quiet. I'd absolutely stay here again :)"
