Stayed a few nights","My friend and I were ending our trans-Atlantic cruise in Fort Lauderdale and drove to Cape Coral to meet another friend who lives in Ft. Myers. We were looking for a home with a pool, near good food and room for all of us. We found that at Dolphin Villa.
We found the home to be in very clean and working order. There was lots of places for seating and enough separate areas to relax. The pool is enclosed in a screen area and was an optimal temperature for swimming or floating around. There is a small refrigerator outside and a serving counter for any snacks.
One thing to be aware is that the Main Bedroom bed is very high and requires a step to get in and out of. It was ok for us but may be an issue for some others. The queen beds in the other two rooms are very firm but comfortable.
The owner really gave thought to coffee lovers with a coffee station that had everything you need to make a great start to your day.
We highly recommend Dolphin Villa."

Stayed a few nights","This was such a lovely airbnb. Everything was great: location, cleanliness, and the overall space was nice and open. Master bedroom was soooo nice. The only downside is that there is work being done to the house next to it and it’s very loud out by the pool almost all day. Not anything you can do about that, but it is a damper on the pool days if that’s what you book it for. We still had a great trip!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed this space! It was decorated lovely, and the pool area is lighted wonderfully for evening swims. The home is large with two areas to hang out, two kitchen table spaces, and a very large kitchen. Although we didn't cook or eat there, the kitchen is fully accommodating with many dishes, and accessories to cook a full meal. There were games to use, a radio for music, floats to float in the pool with, towels and some toiletries if you forgot to bring shampoo.
We didn't use the beautiful master bedroom and adjoining bathroom and shower as there wasn't a closet to hang our things, this is locked for the owners, but there are plenty of dressers if you fold your clothes. Instead opted to use the smaller of the rooms, with closets, near an additional bathroom which connected directly to the pool for easy in and out showers to support a clean pool. Definitely a great space for a family gathering.
Beautiful Home - Highly Recommend!!"

Stayed with kids","Dolphin Villa was great for our family! The home was very welcoming and clean and felt like home. The easy access to laundry, the pool door leading right into the bathroom, a kitchen with everything a family could need and plenty of space. The family spent endless hours outside in the pool. The house had lots of beach towels, beach chairs, sand toys and a cooler for every adventure we took. The house itself was 5 stars, however we did run into some longer commutes to go into Ft. Myers because we had to cross over the river, so that might be something to consider. We would definitely book this house again and will recommend it to others."

Great to just get up in the morning and head out to the pool deck while the family each wandered out too as they started their day. Even a bonus that the neighborhood layout was perfect to bring my bike and get in a good number of miles while staying off main roads."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great AirBnB. I use this service a lot and this was, by far, the best. First off, it is a beautiful home - very clean and easy to keep clean. It's a wonderful neighborhood and not too far away from things.
It definitely has a more ""home-y"" feel since it is livable - it's not just a house with furniture and otherwise empty. There are a lot of useful things, cleaning supplies, extras, and good amenities. We flew in so we weren't able to bring a bunch of stuff that we needed for days at the beach, but they had it covered. There were beach towels, chairs, coolers, to-go containers, suntan lotion, etc.
The kitchen is fully stocked with supplies; pots and pans, utensils, etc. which was very helpful since we were there for about a week. They had extra toiletries like toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, etc. which were a lifesaver (I left my toothbrush at a hotel)."

They had so many additional amenities, the place was beyond clean, i never once’s had concerns of hygiene or safety during our stay. You can really tell they put in a lot of effort to the quality of your stay.
The location is also perfect!! you have grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, literally anything you could need with in a max 15 minute drive.
I have no complaints whatsoever and will definitely be staying here again in the future! Thank you guys so much once again!!"

Stayed a few nights","Helena's duplex was great. The place was very clean and very well equipped with pots, pans, cups, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, ROKU Smart TV's, beach chairs and floaty ""noodles"". If you're looking for a comfortable, private place to stay that feels more relaxed than a Hotel, this is a nice spot. We never even saw the neighbors. Helena was very easy to communicate with and got back to us quickly.
The duplex is located right in the middle of Cape Coral and only a short drive from this local neighborhood strip. However, if you're looking for beach access, it's about 25-30 mins away depending on which beach. Totally fine, but having a car is must.
The unit was clean, comfortable, and well maintained. There were a few very minor fit an finish issues, but nothing that disturbed our stay and similar to any kind of stuff that you'd find in a regular hotel room. Would visit again."

The home was spotlessly clean, had a bountiful supply of towels, clean linen, well appointed kitchen, fantastic laundry and all round excellent - down to a fireplace and random wild bunnies in the backyard.
The bathrooms are all spacious, the rooms are spread out, the surroundings are so calm and peaceful. We felt truly rested and comfortable.
Location was also great. That’s an ALDIs about five mins away, gas stations etc."

The pool is great, warm and for those who stay longer, I would recommend to rent a boat and park it in the canal in front of the house. We have been there with small children - it migh be scary that they might break something in this well equipped house with kids, but finally, the nice things are high enough and the kids understood very well to respect nice things. Regarding the Cape Coral, it’s very residential, you definitely need the car (or boat), but it’s a nice stop and change from the busy areas. And It was great to communicate with Irina - very quick response and precise. We loved our stay!"

Only 35 minutes to Sanibel Island Lighthouse Beach and 60 minutes to Captiva North End Beach (much calmer water, less wind). Very clear why Irina is a Super Host - responded very quickly to all communication. Already considering this place for a trip next year!"

It is perfect. The pool and lanai, the canal with a dock for fishing, the Jacuzzi tub, the huge walk in shower, the comfortable beds, the relaxing living room, the garage with opener, the awesome kitchen loaded with everything you need to prepare and enjoy a gourmet meal.
The list just keeps on going. She responds very quickly. The value of her home based on all the amenities is a pure steal!
Only two of us but could easily entertain a group of six!
Located close enough to get to all the major beaches.

Group trip","Irina's three bed / three bath home is gorgeous, clean, and in a very nice neighborhood. Two of the rooms have en suites while the other bedroom has the bathroom just outside of the room. We enjoyed our stay in her home. It's a short drive to Sanibel / Captiva Island.
We planned the last day of our trip, which happened to be the nicest to hang out by the pool. Unfortunately, the pool heater was not working. The waterfall is how the pool heats and that water was the same temp as the pool water. The pool thermometer was not working either, so we could not see what the exact temperature of the water was at, but it felt to be around the 70s. I texted her about the heater not working and she was prompt to respond, however, she could not find a technician to come and look at it. She even offered to come look at it herself.
It was a bummer we didn't get to get in the pool, but the location was great for all the other activities we wanted to do!"

Stayed a few nights","The property is absolutely beautiful with lots of tasteful touches and was sparkling clean upon our arrival. The Jacuzzi jet tub was absolutely WONDERFUL so I enjoyed taking many baths during our stay. The weather was cooler than normal during our stay so Irina agreed to increase the pool temp for us for a nominal fee. It was totally worth it as the pool is great! The waterfall feature pours warm water into the pool when the heater is on. We didn't have a boat but I found the dock to be a great place to get some sun and do yoga while overlooking the water which is full of wildlife. I imagine fishing off the dock would yield very successful results. Another fantastic feature was the cascading sliding glass doors that allow you let the inside in if desired. Every feature/fixture/appliance was top notch and I would rent any property from Irina knowing that I'll be taken care of with her exceptional hospitality. Thanks again Irina!

Stayed about a week","My family came to Cape Coral for a funeral. My initial encounter with Irina during such a difficult time was appreciated because she promptly notified us if she had availability and made our entire experience with planning accommodations stress free. The house is beautifully decorated, spacious and has anything you think you may need in a home. To save money my family was able to cook our meals but the neighborhood is close to restaurants, shopping and grocery stores. If I came to this area for vacation I would not even look for a hotel. I would definitely try to stay at Irina's home again."

Stayed a few nights","spent 5 nights at this location and it was great. Three nicely appointed bedrooms, two great bathrooms and a well stated kitchen and living room. I would suggest that if you are saying here, bring soap and shampoo. What was provided compared to other spots was at best minimal. I do not expect soap and shampoo to be at any rental, but having it at every previous stay made it feel expected. The outdoor space is great. A caveat to those using the lounge chairs around the pool: Do not lean back to far.
Great place, ould stay again for certain. My two demerits are minimal at best"

Stayed a few nights","We booked Jonathon's airbnb last minute due to another host canceling our reservation, which worked out for the best because we absolutely loved the Airbnb and would highly recommend booking.
The property was impeccably clean and spacious. The private pool was a definite highlight, along with the screened in porch with the outdoor tv. The gym equipment in the garage was a great bonus, Check in was a breeze and had no issues for the duration of our stay.
Jonathan was incredibly accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. He also gave us recommendations on places to go in the area.
The locations was perfect I felt safe by myself when my fiancé went golfing. There are golf courses that are all between 10-30 minutes away. There is also plenty of restaurants (our favourite was The Jungle Bird Tiki Bar) and grocery stores in the area.
We highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway! Thank you Jonathon :)"

The kitchen was amazing I didn't need anything it was all there any amentitee you can possibly need was provided. The beds were amazing the bathrooms were beautiful and clean. The pool was AMAZING! The back porch with the tv was a great addition to swimming in the pool late night. My son and I have been telling everyone the experience we had. Perfect quiet location and close to everything needed. I have been spoiled lol. My expectations for any Airbnb are set so high now since this was the very first one I stayed at. Jonathan you are amazing and I'm so happy we did business together. If I ever visit again I will definently reach out! THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.

The location is convenient from the airport and beautifully placed on the waterfront. The massive patio was partially covered creating an amazing indoor/outdoor space. The heated pool was massive and great for swimming laps and a larger square area was where we played catch with the kids. The spa was perfect and easy to use. It heated right away and was the perfect way to begin each day with breathtaking views of the sun rising over the water. The sun has full sun until late afternoon (important to us). The dock with tiki hut was a great place for lunch and fishing and we loved kayaking around the bay. The kitchen was well appointed and the beds/bedding very comfortable. There was a separate suite with a large bedroom, private bath, expansive counter space & beverage fridge with a comfortable recliner. It was a privilege to stay at Skyline Dr and we hope to return!"

We booked the house to celebrate my wife's birthday with her siblings. Unfortunately, we lost their father the week before check-in. While we contemplated canceling, they decided this would be a great retreat to relax, recoupe, and reset.
We will definitely visit again."

The house is very spacious and modern. The furniture in the living room is very modern but not practical for lounging, a little hard for sitting and watching movies but does look great. Everything we needed to enjoy the property was there, all cooking appliances, outdoor activities, water activities, etc. more than enough towels, chairs and floats for everyone to enjoy. AC was awesome and cooled the home wonderfully. The home was stocked with more than enough toilet paper which is always a plus. All TVs fans and lights were labeled and easy to operate. The beds were very comfortable. The master bedroom was missing blinds but the host came and resolved the issue quickly. Sheets could have been washed better so we did wash those again before using. Beautiful home and vacation spot for families to enjoy. ❤️❤️"

It has a real wow factor especially the pool/patio area and the view especially at sunrise is so serene. Kayaking off the dock in the canal was a real bonus too…my husband and I made it all the way to the mangroves…about 1.5 hr trip, a great way to start the day!
The house is pristine and well equipped with very comfortable beds and with more than enough space for our extended family of seven.

Unfortunately, the internet went out during our less than 24-hour stay, and service in the area was bad to use a hot spot. As this was a work trip, this was very inconvenient. For this price, I also envisioned toiletries in the bathroom and coffee options available. We had a few pods for single-serve cups but no other coffee supplies (sugar, cream, etc.) For the short stay we had, we enjoyed the comfortable accommodations but wanted to provide that feedback for future guests."

We loved the panoramic views of the open Gulf water from the bedrooms, living room and lanai. We ate our breakfast out on the dock under the Tiki hut each morning and enjoyed the fresh air. I loved how much seating there was, between the lounge chairs, the table outside on the lanai, the dining room table, the barstools and of course modern leather couches in the living room. This home is special because it has a mother in law suite that we turned into the kids area and it was nice and separate but still only a few steps away from everything. Restaurant, beach and downtown activities were on a short drive away. We loved our trip, and we will definitely stay at our Skyline Paradise Home again!"

All in all: we can clearly recommend Henelas place, it’s a perfect centrally located hub to tour the region. Just one remark for visitors: the Ft. Myers / Cape Coral area still shows some reminiscences of hurricane Ian (only 6 months ago), therefore some beaches in the area still have to be cleaned and fixed before reopening. Please check out in advance if you are aiming at visiting specific beaches or islands."

The pool worked great, after we got some working AA batteries in the remote on the second day and got the heating situation figured out. Few quick comments: We ran out of laundry detergent and hand soap. We were not able to get the main TV to work for family movie nights. It would not connect to the internet (which worked great). The other TVs in the house worked great. Some of the remotes were also out of batteries, which added to the frustration with trying to get the big one to work. Some of the pillows in the house were a bit cheap and inconsistent, especially in the beds with multiple beds. Host tried to fix what she could from afar."

Group trip","What a beautiful place! This was our first time renting from AIRBNB and we were not 100% how it worked. We were there for a family reunion celebration at my sisters located down the street. I would definitely return to this location and AirBNB. Sophie and Julia were very responsive, we did not hace to reaching out to them the whole week due to instructions left for us.
Thank you !

All the neighbors wish we would rent it all the time..some of the quietest neighbors they have ever had. Wish there would have been some written explanation of how to run pool and tv. Otherwise enjoyed our stay."

Cape Coral itself is a very nice area, conveniently located near plenty of stores, restaurants, and specialty shops.. yet the home is tucked away in a very peaceful nook of the neighborhood. Honestly, I cannot give enough compliments to this owner but I definitely would recommend this rental."

I also want to compliment Angie on how well she stocked the kitchen. I love to cook and had everything I needed. It’s nice to be in a kitchen with quality cookware and utensils!! I highly recommend Angie’s home and we plan to stay again next time we’re in Florida."

We felt like we were at our own private resort! The pool is big and clean. I love salt pools and this one especially as you barely notice the salt after feeling (if that makes sense). We were there the very end of Nov so the sun never hit the pool but it was still just warm enough to enjoy. We had a friend stop by to see the place and she loved it so much she is booking for her family visiting next month :)

Stayed a few nights","If you're reading this review, I assume you're considering booking here—stop thinking and DO IT! I visited Angie's house in Cape Coral with two friends, and we all agreed this was hands down the best AirBnB any of us have ever stayed in. After we stopped oohing and aahing at the house itself—the high ceilings, the furniture, the baskets of amenities, the gorgeous lanai & pool, the high-end appliances, and the beautiful decorations—we settled in to enjoy one of the most relaxing vacations we've ever had.
We stocked up on groceries, then spent most of the week just enjoying the space. We plugged into the gigantic monitor in the office and got some work done, watched TV on the enormous screen in the living room, floated in the perfectly-temperatured pool, did some grilling, watched a thunderstorm and sunsets from the comfort of the lanai, and did our best to pretend it was real life and we weren't only there on vacation.
You want amenities? This house has everything. I've never stayed at such a well-appointed AirBnB. We ended up calling it Wish House because every time we'd say, ""I wish there was a..."" the thing we were hoping for would appear. You want chip clips? Chopsticks? A meat thermometer? Sunscreen? Extra blankets? Ziploc bags? Waffle iron? Pool noodles? A full set of spices? You got it! Want to feel like you're in a spa? Go take a luxurious rainfall shower with the provided delicious-smelling soaps and then wrap yourself up in your big fluffy robe! Want to feel like a chef? Bust out your full set of Wüsthof knives, every single cooking accoutrement you could imagine, and get to it! Feeling ambitious? Do some yoga with the included equipment! Want to go to the beach? Angie has your back! We did a day trip to Sanibel Island, and were able to bring all the beach essentials—chairs, cooler, canopy, etc.
Additionally, our interactions with the host were excellent; Angie clearly takes great pride in this house and was always responsive and friendly in her communications. (Though since the house was so well-stocked and the guide book was so comprehensive, we didn't need to ask about much.) Angie, we can't thank you enough for this wonderful vacation!!"

The house was wonderful. Everything was as described and Jose was extremely kind and responsive. There were no surprises or disappointments with this house, it is exactly as described and the photos were spot on. I will definitely rent again when I come back for a visit. I'm sorry the visit was so short, I wanted to stay longer! Thank you for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at Jose's place for my husbands birthday . it's 30 mins from Ft Myers Beach, but Cape Coral has a lot of restaurants, and this location is pretty central to where you need to go. You will need a rental car if you plan to go to the beach and out. Everything really closes at 10 or 11 pm. We're not big going out people, so the house location with the pool was great to take it slow. While the neighborhood is quiet and quick access to FT Myers beach, and the restaurants on the drag that can be 5-10 min drive.
The house was clean and simple, which is all you need. The pool is great. I
wouldn't say 100% private, but at least 90%, there isn't a privacy fence on the back end but fine if you're in the pool. the pool cage is great, no bugs.
I 100% would stay here again and in Cape Coral for a chill relaxing
trip. It was our first time here, and I hope Ft Myers and the islands can rebuild after Ian. This area is a gem."

Stayed about a week","Jose is a superb host, communicating was quick and easy and he asked how we were and if we needed anything during our stay. The area is quite from neighbouring houses and the locals are welcoming and friendly. Although there is a little road noise is in the background it did not drown out the amazing variety of birds singing in the garden. There is an abundance of beautiful wild life in this little area .
The villa is huge and has everything catered for. We had a clean pool that is north facing and has the sun on it all day long. There are plenty of pool toys and an outdoor BBQ. The pool area has a small area to sunbathing all day and the rest is covered for that rest bite out of the sun. You do need a car to visit places but not necessarily if you want to just chill by the pool in nice surroundings. Captain hooks sushi locally is amazing food. I would recommend this villa for a quite chilled break for non partying people."

Kitchen is very well equipped for meals prep.
Beds were comfortable and lots of extra linens for extended stays.
Car rental like he says is ideal so you can drive to beaches and attractions.
Brhett was very responsive- we only had one small issue and it was dealt with immediately!
Close to restaurants and grocery stores. Really close to miromar outlets - quick 30 minute drive.
There are beach towels and pack and play as well as linens for that as well as a high chair. Very helpful when you have grandkids coming.
We enjoyed our time and would definitely rent again!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful house in a safe neighborhood! The living room is spacious and comfy. Mostly everything is super clean. The pool and spa were amazing, but the tree coverage is minimal. You will see straight into the neighbor's backyard and they will see you. They also had a pretty raucous party with loud music until 1 am on our first night. We weren't bothered, but something to keep in mind if you don't like loud noises. The bath towels were the only thing to give me pause with a mild smell and washed out look. Given that the host asks guests to start a load of towels/sheets before leaving to help the cleaning lady, I worry that the previous guests might have forgotten to use detergent or hot water. There are too many variables with how clean the sheets and towels might be due to asking guests to start the laundry, and I would rather know they were washed by someone who has a standardized practice. This task also seems odd to give to guests given the high cleaning fee. Overall very nice stay."

We watched a couple football games on the giant living room tv and honestly nicer than a sports bar. Super close to a grocery store and the kitchen was fully equipped for cooking in. We had some of the best sleep we have had in a long time. Brehtt was extremely responsive when we had an issue and it was resolved when we returned from our adventures that day. Strongly recommend staying at Tranquil Palms

The pool with a cage is great and offers great privacy. We often used the kayaks for tours into the big bay. The highlight was that we were accompanied on one of our tours by a manatee family!
The location of the house is also excellent. There is a good Publix supermarket 3 minutes away. If you need more, you can drive about 15 minutes to Del Prado and have a huge selection of shops.
If the chance arises for us we will come back.
Thank you Suzy and Jeff for a great BBQ!

There were plenty of towels for the pool, bath, and beach, and the bath towels were so soft haha. We were so shocked at how close Rotary Park was (right at the end of the street) and we really enjoyed walking there with our son to explore the trails and play at the park. We spent most of our time relaxing in or by the pool, and our son loved it, as did we! It was so fun to be lounging in the pool with a view of the canal right there, and the pool had full sun practically all day. We had a question about the pool when we got there and Jeff responded so quickly and made sure we had everything we needed. We def recommend and hope to return!"

Stayed with kids","Jeffery’s place was wonderful! Even complete with a pack n play and high chair! That alone takes a huge stress off of traveling with a baby. The location was drivable to beaches, but we mainly stuck to the parks this time. Rotary Park at the end of the street was perfect and super close! We fished out back most nights and spent most of the days in the pool. He was a wonderful host and checked in on us a couple times during the week. I really appreciated that type of open communication and willingness to help!"

It had everything we could have ever needed plus some. Our kids loved the pool, as did my husband I. We also enjoyed kayaking through the canal's. The communications was too notch. Unfortunately Hurricane Ian hit while we were in this home and Jeff and Suzy checked on us often and have kept in touch with us since. We had to abandon some stuff due to loss of our suitcases and they said they would get it back to us. Thank you so much for your hospitality and caring hearts! Whenever we get brave enough to venture to Cape Coral again, we will be back for sure!"

Stayed about a week","Jeffrey's Pelican home was beautiful! The pictures on the website do not do it justice, it is a gorgeous home fully appointed with everything we needed. The location is so wonderful on the canal, with boat dock and lift, it was only a few minutes to the bay and out to the ocean for a day of fishing or a sunset sail! The pool was beautiful and had all the fun toys, pool floaties and noodles. We used the kayaks to take a tour of the canal and out to the causeway, which was a great treat! Covered patio was a great spot for morning coffee, overlooking the beautiful landscaping, palm trees and the canal. Jeffrey answered all my questions so quickly I was so impressed by him, he is a super host! Our family loved it so much we are already planning our next trip back!! Thank you so much Jeffrey for a week of fun Florida memories that our family will treasure. ❤️"

Stayed with kids","The house is in a great location. We were in Ft. Myers for a PG Baseball tournament and the house was within 30 minutes of the many different fields we used. It was close to restaurants, the beach, and the historic areas too. The house itself seems newly renovated with stylish furniture. The beds are VERY comfortable with plenty of pillows. The patio area faces east so it's shaded and cool in the afternoon. My kids enjoyed kayaking and fishing on the dock. The pool was kept warm and comfortable. There were extra beach towels & rafts by the pool. One note, the pool has ladders for entering & exiting the pool rather than concrete stairs. We had no problems using the ladders, just an FYI. There is a fully appointed kitchen with plenty of dishes and cookware. The host is responsive & helpful. We enjoyed our visit to the Happy Pelican and can't wait to return."

Stayed about a week","We just returned from our trip to Cape Coral, FL and had an amazing time! Jeff and Suzy's home was beautiful with three bedrooms and two baths which was perfect for our family of four. The photos don't do this gorgeous home justice it is far more beautiful than the photos. Whenever we are looking to stay at a home, one of the first things we look for is cleanliness and this home had just that. We enjoyed the heated pool very much. It was huge, very clean and well maintained and because it was heated we used it anytime of the day we wanted to. Lots of pools noodles, and various pool inflators, our kids enjoyed it. The patio was great with a huge TV which we enjoyed watch while taking a break from the pool and relaxing. We used the barbeque grill which was very conveniently located near the pool. We enjoyed using all four bikes to ride around the neighborhood in the evenings.
We were pleasantly surprised that all rooms including the patio had smart TVs, cable and capabilities to rewind and fast forward while watching. I love the open floor plan which made easy flow from the kitchen to dining room to living area. Jeff and Suzy really put a lot of thought into what guests would need while vacationing in their home. The kitchen was well stocked which everything you will need to use to cook meals, we enjoyed using the glassware dishes, pots and pans and utensils, since I was doing most of the cooking I enjoyed using this kitchen everyday, it was my happy place.
Jeff and Suzy were extremely responsive with any question we had leading up to and during our stay. They were very helpful, friendly, respectful and polite. Suzy reached out to us to informed us of Tropical storm Elsa which was approaching and offered to help with accommodation if your flight got canceled and sure enough our flight was canceled. It was very comforting to know that we didn’t had to panic as result because the we had already discussed accommodation with the host, it was less stressful as a result of that communication. Jeff even suggested another airport that we can consider and his advised helped because we got a flight from that airport much sooner.
The location was very close to everything that anyone will need while on vacation, also very close to Fort Myers as well. This home and location was perfect us and we can’t say enough about it. Also, the neighborhood was very clean with well manicured lawns, bike lanes and beautiful homes, the neighbors were very nice and friendly. We would definitely stay there again and would also recommend this home to anyone/family who needs to just have a great and relaxing time away. It was truly a home away from home."

Dawn was extremely responsive & checked in with us throughout our stay to make sure all was well. We even felt comfortable enough to ask her small things which she happily responded to :)
