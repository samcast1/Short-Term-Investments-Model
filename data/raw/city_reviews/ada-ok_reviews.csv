Lara provided a mini fridge/freezer, microwave, and coffee pot and some fun food treats, ice (huge huge bonus!), and flavored coffee. I had a fun towel animal to greet me on my arrival and having my own bathroom was great. You get well worth your money here and Lara was great! I will definitely stay here again if I'm in southern Oklahoma!"

Group trip",This place was amazing! We stayed there with six people and we still couldn’t believe how big this house really was. It was really a beautiful house and d neighborhood with plenty to do around town. The only con I saw in this was the master bedroom shower being a rain fall shower and not a traditional shower head but other than that all of the bathrooms were amazing. I would 100% recommend this to anyone just trying to get away for a while and relax.

Like a transport through time to another era yet the kitchen and bathrooms were updated and current. A wonderful mixture of both old and new. Beds were great. Lots of pillows. Soft sheets. Great TV room with bar for the whole family to relax and watch a movie. We loved this place and would definitely like to stay again next Christmas. Thanks for sharing it with us!

Stayed with a pet","I stayed here with my partner and our two dogs for about a week. The house is beautiful and cozy, and we loved the large kitchen with lots of counter space.
It’s very close to lots of things: parks, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc. The neighborhood is quiet, and the courtyard is so peaceful.
The front yard is fenced, which we really appreciated for our dogs. Our smaller dog could get through the bars of the fence, so we kept her leashed when we went outside.
We really enjoyed our evenings in the comfortable TV room and found many convenient places throughout the house to set up the laptops and get work done.
There was so much space we didn’t use since it was just the two of us, but we’d love to return someday and bring more family next time! I definitely recommend this stay!"

Stayed over a week","Hosts are fantastic, gracious with solid communication. I appreciate that since travel is, well travel.
They have an incredibly unique home. I was excited to see it as the trip was upcoming. It’s a mix of gorgeous century old tiles and arches along with newer remodeling. I am not even scratching the surface on all of the neat things about this place.
Reading reviews prior to coming I brought my professional camera and had fun on my down time taking pictures of the house, the stars and all the new ducklings at the nearby park.
My favorite place, is the upstairs tiled shower because you can sing so acoustically. The rain shower is great modern touch and wonderful.
I was primarily upstairs, here for work and wasn’t in all of the house but knew full well this is a great place to bring family and friends, big yard, back patio, grill etc!
Getting in late on an extended stay, it was very nice to have things available until I could get sorted.
Beautiful people, David and Oriana.
Recommend!"

It was very comfortable and plenty of room with our family of 4 + 3 pups! We will definitely be back!

Stayed a few nights","If there were places like this in every town, I’d never stay in a hotel again. I’m a realtor and I intentionally travel to unique places to share the experience and encourage others to as well. This one takes the cake! It’s bursting with history and mystery but cozy and charming and boasts every modern amenity. The hosts are wonderful people. Great communication. The property is in a perfect location. We Doordashed food and craft coffees from a number of wonderful options because we were so enjoying the space. We grilled out on the nice new deck. We enjoyed the fireplace each evening. The dogs had plenty of safe space to play. We did take them to the dog park and walked around the beautiful pond at Wintersmith. I’d encourage you to do so too or walk the neighborhood at least.
If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. If you’re thinking for one minute about booking a stay here, the thinking is over! Do it!
If you’re looking for stuff to do, check out nearby Sulphur, Davis or Pauls Valley, OK. Many Indian history experiences, 77’ waterfall at Turner Falls, zip lines, Arbuckle drive through wilderness a great state park lake, etc. So much to do and see!"

This house is a prime location in Ada. It backs up to the Country Club, and is just down the street from retail & restaurants. We also enjoyed the close proximity to Wintersmith Park and took advantage of the playgrounds, swings, community pool & water slides. My kids were attending a summer program at the university, and it was an easy drive there as well.
Great Airbnb experience with gracious, hospitable hosts. I’ll definitely book here the next time we are in Ada!"

They did a very quick cleaning turnaround to accommodate our booking that began as a party of 11 plus one dog, and allowed us to add three more people and a second dog before check-in day. Adam’s communication was excellent throughout the booking and pre-arrival process, and both he and Linda were very gracious during our stay, making themselves available but never intrusive. We stayed over Independence Day, and they even set up a safe area for us to shoot off fireworks and checked in mid afternoon to make sure we had everything we needed to celebrate. We enjoyed one afternoon of heavy rain, during which Adam made the trek outside to let us know that one of our cars had an open window. They clearly value relationship, and they work hard to create an environment that affords families the opportunity to grow their own. Thank you both for a wonderful stay and your sweet gifts to our children."

Finding the property was easy, thanks to clear driving directions provided by Adam. Upon arrival, Adam warmly greeted us and gave us a thorough tour of the property, highlighting all the activities and amenities available. It was impressive to see how meticulously he had planned even the smallest details, like providing a lighter for the fire. Adam's genuine care for his customers stood out, making us feel valued. Our entire family had a fantastic time at the ranch, with the kids especially enjoying the property and its surroundings. We highly recommend experiencing Adam's wonderful hospitality.

Love that there are always plenty of dish towels and trash sacks. There is a washer and dryer to keep the kitchen towels clean and fresh. I also love that there are coffee pots…both ground coffee and a keurig type coffee pot. The brooms and vacuums are also available for use so you can keep the space clean. The door locks are great and self lock. Two bedrooms are upstairs and one is downstairs. The kitchen is good. There is one oven and an air fryer, dishwasher and plenty of storage. All the TV’s work great. There are a lot of people walking the street and a few through the back yard so we kept the doors on the vehicles locked at all times."

But that was put to rest since this home was awesome. 👏 👏 👏 I was visiting a loved one for the holidays and it felt very much like Christmas 🎄!!! It lightly snowed when I got there! Which was perfect since everything looked like it was sprinkled by powder sugar :3 I had a blast and everything was far and beyond my expectations. A really nice place for a group of 2-6!

Hosts were very responsive, we had issues getting in and they assisted while I was standing at the door. No waiting. The bathrooms and kitchen were very well stocked. One of the best we have used.
Hosts were very flexible. We had family issues that were not resolved in our original time frame, Chris and Kelly were so accommodating and we were able to stay an extra day. We will be staying here when we come back to Ada, as long as it is available."

It comfortably housed 5 adults and 3 young kids (mom and kids shared the huge basement master and space). They provided plush towels, warm blankets, and met different needs including access to items in the kitchen and bathroom that were super helpful to have on hand. We will definitely be back next summer. Five+ stars!!"

We had fun using the kayaks and made use of the grill without issue. Carol is an awesome host and offered us the ability to check in early which helped us out a lot. Thank you.

The beautiful gas fireplace kept the cabin warm the whole time. The home made goodies in the little gift shop are delicious, I highly recommend all the homemade breads. We are looking forward to going back in the spring/summer to enjoy more of the outdoor activities. You will not regret your stay with Carol at any of her Air BNBs."

Loved the design and most of all LOVED THAT ALL OUR FAMILY COULD ATTEND!! Its really hard to find nice places where they allow our dogs and its always so sad that we cant travel as a family because someone has to stay behind to watch them. We also appreciate being able to book one night and. Not be forced to book 2 nights! Sometimes we are not able to come for 2 nights due to all our work schedules clashing so that was most appreciated!!! Equipped with everything for kitchen needs! They have a little store which had so much !!! I was amazed! Everything was clean and so well designed! Kayaks where located on the lake and easily accessible. So we MOST DEFINITELY WILL

Stayed a few nights","This was our best Airbnb experience ever. Carol was so helpful and responded right away to any questions we had. The home was beautiful, spacious, clean, and well appointed. The furniture was really nice and something I’d buy for my own home. The patio and outside area was truly amazing. There’s hammocks, fire pits, tons of room to walk, and our dog was in heaven running around all weekend. We used the kayaks one morning on the pond which was so peaceful and relaxing. We also used the hot tub which was really high end and comfortable - again nothing was skimped on here. The shop just steps from your home has all kinds of snacks and souvenirs which we took advantage of. The horses in the field right next to the shop and hot tub are beautiful and add to the experience at this amazing place. Lastly, the on site EV charger was so convenient for us (J1772, all Tesla’s come with this adapter). Truly well done, we will be returning even though it’s a 6 hour trip for us."

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay at the Mallard! The home was spotless, and perfect for a mini retreat. We booked a night 48 hours in advance and Carol was gracious in allowing us not only to stay, but providing flexible check in and leave.
The store on the property was perfect. There’s plenty of drinks and snacks. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. A perfect touch by having the towels for guest to wipe their dog’s paws at the front door. The Mallard felt like home due to Carol’s attention to details, including having magazines, puzzles and extra linens in the hallway closet. Items are easy to find in the home. The bathrooms are large and accommodating for guests wanting space to get ready for the day.
The retreat is a hour from Reba’s and Blake Shelton’s restaurants. We visited both in one day, and it was made perfect by our stay at the Mallard. We watched the rain from the large patio, and it was very peaceful.
We’ve already recommended the stay to our friends and we’ll stay again!"

She was flexible with our check-in and greeted us with a quick tour as soon as we arrived. We stopped at the small fruit stand right before turning and picked up a few tasty fried pies and the most delicious cantaloupe ever. The ponds are filled with fish, the tour will explain which species and where. My son and I had the greatest time on both bodies of water on a variety of kayaks that she has waiting by the water! Bring something ready, and you will have something snagged before getting yelled at to finish unpacking. Beautiful and clean home, fast internet and plenty to watch on a large TV. Local small grocery had everything you didn't bring or need. Overall, ia great little escape with a fantastic host. oh, and the bread is amazing. Go ahead and order to have immed ately.

We enjoyed fishing the two ponds on the property and caught numerous bass and crappie. The two-man bass boat was great to fish both of the ponds with and was a lot of fun. It worked out great! The Little Wren Shop on the property was such a sweet and cute addition to the stay. We enjoyed visiting it daily for snacks, souvenirs and gifts. We recommend the Heron House or either of the two other houses (Mallard House or Cardinal House) on the property. We absolutely had the best time and we look forward to our next trip!

Where else can you have access to two private ponds with fishing gear and a small boat with trolling motor? On top of that, there is a side-by-side that Carol allows you to use to transport the boat or kayaks between the two ponds as you see fit. We caught 8 largemouth bass between the two of us and had a great time making s’mores under the stars. The accommodations were comparable to a 5-star resort. Modern decor with luxurious appliances and incredibly large bathrooms.
This property is a FIND!"

The kitchen was stocked with every utensil needed to prepare meals. 2 types of coffee pots, daily meds like aspirin, sunscreen, bug spray, laundry detergent, robes, firewood, propane for grill. Doggy bowls and doggy towels for wet little paws. I believe Carol should give classes how to properly prepare an AIR BNB! EXTREMELY HAPPY with our stay and her hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","10/10 would recommend.
Carol is such a welcoming host and her place is a gem. Looking for a dog friendly place to do a dog vacation? Perfect spot for the dogs to run around. There’s so much land for them to frolic and let loose. If there’s swimmers, water is just a short walk away. Lots of sniffing and snoffing to do. Wanting to just get away and unwind? Carol has such attention to detail. You’ll have everything you’ll need there. Lots of walking areas and kayaking. The interior design is one of the best we’ve seen (even counting airbnbs in big cities like Seattle or New York). It’s so cozy, modern, and clean inside. Absolutely impeccable. Quality of life features like hose outside to rinse the dogs, large deep kitchen sink, a quaint little shop just nearby if you’re craving sweets or s’more kits, washer/dryer, firewood, lots of charging ports.
We will definitely be back again. We had a wonderful time. Thank you Carol for your hospitality!"

Carol, the owner is attentive to your wants or needs and you can tell that if anything is in disrepair or there is a problem, she will make it right! There is lots of outdoor space to roam. The homes are perfect for gathering with EVERYTHING you need and many things a person might forget, like q-tips, or marsmellow skewers. Everything is so well organized. Decorations and cleanliness are on par. I would highly recommend this place for a couple or a family who want to get away for a short stay. You will feel relaxed once there!"

Carol really knows how to be super accommodating & the shop she keeps open for the guests’ own use is such an awesome and unique addition.
The houses were clean, well-stocked, modern, yet homey & comforting. We hardly unpacked our kitchen items as there is everything you need including spices, oil, plates/pots/pans, and even the necessary utensils to cook on the outdoor grill that is safely piped to a propane tank.
Kayaking the pond was awesome & there were plenty comfy chairs & areas to lounge & enjoy the shade from the beautiful green trees. Will definitely recommend!"

Stayed one night","We had a wonderful stay in this amazing cabin! Everything we needed was provided, even some extra touches like firewood for a campfire at night and kayaks to use on the water. Carol has thought of everything and has transformed her property into a retreat oasis. There is even a little shop with homemade baked goods and drinks available 24/7. There is fishing gear available also and Carol took the time to show us around, bait our hooks, and make us feel welcome. The beds were comfortable and watching the deer and birds from the back patio was a delight. If you are looking for an escape from the fast-paced world, this is a great place to stay! I plan to book a cabin at Carol’s place again."

We will absolutely return for another stay, looking forward to when we do!"

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay. Carol had canoes, kayaks, and fishing gear. We appreciated the on-site shop that is open 24 hours. The brownies were delicious. We made s’mores with the grill on the patio, as we didn’t want to walk all the way down to the fire pit, but it was an option. Carol showed us around the lot and recommended a restaurant to go to that we went to the next day. The food was DELICIOUS and made with soul.
There were just a couple things that prevented me from giving a 5 star review, but 4.5 for sure. Worth the money especially if you just want to get away from the city for a while. The stars were beautiful too.
Blankets were also provided, which was a pleasant surprise because we forgot to bring ours."

The exceptionally clean modern house is stocked with everything you could need. The 17 acre lake is beautiful and surrounded by lots of trees! It was not unusual to see a heron or two in the lake. Kayaks, life jackets, and fishing poles are provided. The house is tucked away for a retreat type feel yet there is a grocery store and dollar store close should you need anything. Being pet friendly is the icing on the cake! There were bowls with water left out for our dogs when we arrived! We have found our new favorite getaway and look forward to coming back time and again!"

It is so quiet at night and if you love star gazing bring ypur telescope. The pond was peaceful and my family had a great time fishing and kayaking. Carol was an amazing host and her assistant Kim was so helpful I'm in letting us know where the kayaks, life jackets, and the other pond entrance were located. I felt like I entirely overpacked as she had lots of extras in the cabinets for her guests. Plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, and smaller items such as extra toothbrushes, bandaids, coffee pods and seasonings in the kitchen . Carol makes you feel at home. This has by far been the best vacation home we have stayed at thus far."

The house has absolutely everything you can think of including little touches like brand new robes, dog treats, and complimentary bakery items from her shop. It's modern, clean, stylish, and comfy. The land is spectacular. Pics don't do it justice. The 2 rental houses are close to each other, but not so close you feel like you don't have privacy. This place is absolutely perfect if you want to rent both houses and have a SUPER private, tons-of-land, big, nature-driven get together. Kayak the lake. Have a game of Frisbee ending with a cold beer and hot BBQ. Only a 3-min drive to town. I can't say enough good things about this rental. I recommend it without hesitation."

Enjoyed some fishing and was able to utilize a kayak that was available onsite while I was there . Carol is an excellent host and has thought of every detail. The location is an easy about 30 -40 minutes drive north of Sulphur, OK with the Chickasaw National Recreational Area / Lake of the Arbuckles area available to do additional outdoors activities if looking for a little more to do. Just a little early to hit the farmers market stands in the area but there seemed to be a few close by to this location . Overall great experience!"

Stayed a few nights","The room, bathroom and entrance were exactly as described. We always bring everything we need, but in case we hadn't, there were several new toothbrushes, nail clippers etc in the bathroom drawer that I hadn't even noticed til the last day. The room had a coffee maker and bag of coffee, TV, extra toilet paper, iron and ironing board, and much more. These were all nice touches in case we'd forgotten anything. I don't think we will stay here again though because the homeowner got up very early each morning (4 AM I think it was) and made quite a lot of noise right on the other side of the inside door. I actually thought someone had come into our room, so I got out of bed to check it out. One early morning we heard two quick car honks inside the garage (ugh!). The bed was like a trampoline. When one of us turned over, the other kind of bounced up and down before the bed settled back down. All in all, the price was good so it was a great value, but I don't think we will stay here again."

Things were exactly as described, and we felt safe. Our privacy was respected the whole time. We were able to take our dog with us and that was particularly important for our sanity. He loved the little courtyard that was included. We were able to let him out and watch him through the doors until he was ready to come in. The bed is a bit firm, but it was comfortable and there were extra linens, pillows, and paper products in the closet so that we did not have to request anything. We always try to leave things in better condition, so we were happy to find cleaning supplies, broom, and Swiffer in the closet too. Thanks for a great stay, Carolyn. We may stay with you again someday, and we will certainly recommend you."

Carolyn, the host, was quick to respond to any questions I had. The room was very clean and had everything I needed and I will definitely stay again next time I’m in Ada."

Stayed a few nights","I traveled to Ada to attend a conference at East Central University. While I could have stayed at a hotel, I was happy to find Carolyn's place as a more comfortable option. Everything I needed was in the space such as a small fridge, microwave, basic kitchen utensils, and there is a nice area outside the door. It's in a quiet neighborhood that would likely be a great place to walk around. I was happy to have this place to come back to at night and when I had a large break in the afternoon. I would consider coming here again the next time I'm staying in ADA."

I booked at last minute as I was passing through town and this gracious host accomodated me. The room was great and better than what most local hotels have to offer; actually better because of its lovely private porch that comes with the room. Would definitely stay again; hopefully next time bring my pup ❤️ for a run around Wintersmith park ☺️"

Stayed about a week","Carolyn is an awesome host! She was quick to respond to any questions we had, and was very pleasant and helpful. My wife and I being very social people (sometimes a bit too social, lol!) noticed that she didn't interact much and was very professional. This would be a big plus for someone wanting to focus and take care of business. :) The room was very pleasant, comfortable and we felt right at home. Everything was sparkling clean and Carolyn seemed think of everything that we might have needed, but it was the extra touches where Carolyn went above and beyond. My wife and I stayed a full week and because she had extra towels and sheets and even cleaning supplies in the room we were able to thoroughly enjoy our stay without asking for anything! In fact, she even had bottled water and coffee in the room as well. We found the location was also a big plus as it was centrally located to everywhere we needed to go. If your travels ever take you to Ada Oklahoma, we highly recommend staying with Carolyn! :)"

Stayed a few nights","I was pleasantly surprised to find such a great place and value in Ada. I promised my amazing hostess, that I'd certainly tell my FELLOW ECU ALUM about her & her IMPRESSIVE Bungalow & Hospitality!! First, she added a heater to the room, for fear the furnace would not supply enough heat during the single digit weather during my stay. Then, there was the little things. There was plenty of bottled water in my refrigerator, a coffee maker, microwave, tea bags, a very comfy queen bed, a small table & chairs, chest of drawers, closet, a full-sized & completely stocked bathroom, TV, internet, & a private code & lock for the private entrance to your bungalow! With all of this amazingness, I must say the thing I enjoyed the most was her homemade blueberry muffins! IN CLOSING, when you make a trip to Ada to visit an amazing town, college, and The Cradle of the Chickasaw Nation, be sure to make your reservations..EARLY with this outstanding hostess!!"

Opening up the cattle gate to get in, waiting for the cows to mosey off the lane. My son, daughter n law, and grandsons when I had them out to visit and have a steak roast. Christina provided extra chairs, a folding table for me to use when I asked her if it would be acceptable. The gas grill was great. I don't get a chance to entertain my family often and she made it very special for me! I will definitely make this my go to place when I visit my family in Ada! Thank you Christina!"

Christina checked on us continuously and advised us about the tornado shelter behind the home and kept us advised into the late hours of the evening.
No one wants to experience what we did, but she made certain that we were safe and cared for. Despite it all, we had a very special time in a beautiful place. We were very grateful for her."

I agree with others that you will want to get to it in the daylight to see where it is but once you do it’s easy to find after that. Also, unlocking/locking the main gate in the dark is not for the easily scared (read: me) 😂.
The property is so perfect. I cannot say it enough. The sunset and sunrise were beautiful and the cows were so much to watch! We also got to sneak up to the horses and chickens, too.
Ada isn’t far from the ranch and is a cute town with plenty of restaurants and grocery stores, etc. The Main St area was really cute and easily walkable, too. I’m already making plans to stay again but for at least a few days this time."

Stayed a few nights","Nestled back within the trees and outside the bustle of town life rests a little slice of country life. The cabin was quaint and cute in appearance, surrounded by the beautiful landscape of a peaceful retreat. Every morning I would grab my cup of coffee and go sit in the sitting area as I watched the cows and dreamed of what it would be like to live here forever. The house was small but felt roomy and very much inviting. The only reason I did not give this pretty little place another added star was some minor issues such as, tv remote didn’t work, front glass door broke, porch light out (but I put in a new bulb and it worked) and a few other minor details. Overall, we loved this place and those small details will not deter us from staying here again and it shouldn’t you. either. Unfortunately, due to me having an injury I was not able to explore the ranch but, plan of doing that next time. If your thinking about staying here....I highly recommend it!!"

Stayed with a pet","The cabin is wonderful. Interior was better than expected. William has clearly put a lot of work in creating a charming, cozy and modern experience. WiFi worked great. Laundry room, bathroom, bedrooms and kitchen loaded with equipment/supplies and appliances. Shower had great water pressure and temperature. I don't typically sleep well outside of my home but had no problem here, bedding was comfortable and was able to keep the room temps nice and cool with the A/C units and fans. Nice sitting area on front porch and grilling setup on back patio. I had business in Norman/OKC and family in Ada so the location was perfect. Definitely my future go-to AirBnB when visiting central Oklahoma."

Stayed one night","If you’re looking for a really nice and unique AirBnB in an off the beaten path location, this place is for you. I had a small issue finding the place due to GPS failure when I arrived in the small town, but drove around until I recognized the house. Really clean inside and has all the amenities you need. The interior has been uniquely designed and decorated and is comfortable and homey as a result. Didn’t seem to be any options for food locally, but there are a few larger towns within a short drive."

Stayed a few nights","The location was difficult to find due to no cell service and the road shows a different name on internet maps. It’s on the main road of this tiny town so once you know where it is it’s easy access. The queen bed was comfortable but it’s up against the vaulted ceiling so watch your head. Hard to sit up and do anything. The kitchen is well stocked and the place is nicely appointed especially for the price. This is a place you stay because you need to be in the area not for its beautiful surroundings. The neighborhood is run down and dogs were howling and barking every night. William was a great host, we forgot our key one night and he was there in minutes. We really appreciated the extra service. All in all it was better than many other places we’ve stayed."

In addition, I was traveling and hand an appointment change, last minute, the day of check out, William accommodated me w/ out hesitation. Yes, I could have killed some time elsewhere, but it sure made things easier on me to simply get a late checkout! Thank you sir! I'll be back!"

The interior design is wonderful, country and industrial chic, we loved the textured floors and counters in the kitchen, and the bright bursts of turquoise, and the lovely barn doors. Cabin feels cheerful and open, and very warm and inviting. Loved the bold bathroom with the walk in shower and sink on a barrel. Very well stocked and the electric fireplace was beautiful and calming. Fun board games in the living room and lots of thoughtful touches. Wanette is a very cute country town that we loved, and such a peaceful place to stay. William is a wonderful, responsive, thoughtful host. This is a fantastic Airbnb!"

Stayed with kids","This little cottage was perfect. When we walked in, we were immediately met with such a nice smell. Everything was super clean. Our 3 year old ran around barefoot the whole time and his little feet stayed clean. I was very impressed with how clean it was. There was a queen bed upstairs in the loft and a full size bed downstairs. Both beds were extremely comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, hot chocolate, and spices. The dishes were clean. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and more than enough towels.
The home had such a sweet country feel. The window units kept the cottage cool in 100 degree weather. We woke up cold & the fireplace heater warmed the entire home. Our stay was quiet and comfortable. William was very responsive and went above and beyond. I can’t tell you enough how much we appreciated the cleanliness of the home. We will definitely stay again the next time we’re in the area."

A perk we enjoyed is that the front porch faces east, which is where my friends and I found ourselves every morning.

Crockery can be clean as we are paying quite a good amount for cleaning.
We also couldn’t find the thermostat to regulate the temperature as it became too cold by the night.
Other than that the whole place is so cute & perfect location to stay away from the daily chaos.
The whole ambiance is perfect for a small weekend trip to stay alone or with friends and family.
Worth the price.
I totally recommend people to have a stay here."

Stayed with a pet","Wonderful, would definitely recommend. I was surprised by how many people it could easily accommodate and was almost disappointed I was there with just my pets because there is essentially a whole loft bedroom upstairs. I just got it as a last minute booking running away from ⛈️🌪️, so it’s more than I would normally want to pay if I’m just by myself and it’s not a vacation type of thing. I could see this being a great option for young/smaller families with limited budgets. I would definitely consider booking again if I find my way that direction when I’m not traveling solo in the future."

For starters it’s even better than the pictures. It was beautiful and felt so homey. We enjoyed the coffee, the roku,(we had a Disney movie night) and all of the amenities. He had fresh linens, bath supplies, all the cooking supplies you could ask for, laundry detergent. The way it is set up is amazing. My fiancé and I LOVED it! Just close enough to the city that we could go to the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum while we were in town too. (About an hour outside of OKC) Their are neighbors but it’s a quiet neighborhood off the beaten path. William was responsive and answered any questions we had!"

The way the kitchen and restroom are setup, it makes you feel right at home. The living room is very warm and cozy. Best part of all, they allowed us to bring our 3 dogs. They are very small dogs, but we still couldn't stay at any hotel. If given the chance, we will most definitely be back."

Stayed with a pet","What a find! I was driving from LA and was getting super tired so I started searching for a place to call it night.
Luckily I found William’s and booked it immediately and I’m glad I did. The place could not have been more perfect. I was traveling with my motorcycle and a truck load full of my things so being able to park right next to the house made me a lot more comfortable.
The place itself was incredible. Super clean, spacious, well stocked and quiet. I wish I could’ve stayed longer but I had to get back on the road the very next morning. Luckily I slept like a rock. It was the perfect rest stop!
If you’re ever passing through the OKC area or looking for a place to relax for a weekend definitely book this place. It has literally everything you’d need for any length of time.
If I’m ever back in the area I would absolutely book this place again!
Thank you!"

We were in town to visit family and mothers day, so we werent there through the day. although i never got to actually meet karen, i did get a message asking if we needed anything. The only cons i have are the beds could be queen, and the shower is small, it worked for me but a bigger person may have a hard time. There is a dish outside but the tv just has an antenna, which is not a deal breaker. There is a dvd player and a few movies to choose from. All in all it was a nice stay and i would stay again."

Stayed with kids","Joanna was a great host and communicator! We loved the cozy home. The whole place appears nice and remodeled. The kitchen had everything we needed. TV trays (no table) were no problem for our family of 4. Easy to log into our netflix and watch our favorite shows and movies. Comfy beds and evencomfy pull out beds! The kiddos did wake up with the train, but we should have brought our own NOISE MACHINES. Getting into the home was easy, and we felt safe. There was some interesting activity happening with the neighbors, but we just ignored it and kept the doors locked. There is a motion-sensor spotlight at the neighbor's house across the street that came on throughout the night, and the home had no curtains. So bring your own EYE MASKS for sleeping or extra blankets for makeshift curtains. Previous review mentioned host providing snacks or coffee, but that is not the case, so bring your own drip coffee grounds. Joanna was great and very kind!"

That being said Ada is a different community and I just want others to be aware that the train is in the backyard and came by 5 times on our first night and the surrounding houses are in poor repair. The bathroom door doesn’t close which made the small home uncomfortable for our family of 4. It was nice having laundry on site.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed this time last year and it was clean and tidy once again. Easy to babyproof/toddlerproof the second bedroom-- bring a pack n play or toddler cot and move the wooden furniture into the laundry room next door. Bring doorknob covers; outlet covers already on most or all outlets. Nice playset in the backyard our toddler enjoyed!
We stayed Saturday night through Wednesday night and we only encountered an overnight train after 10:45 PM on Wednesday night. Earliest train was after 6:00 AM. We all slept great; kid slept through the one overnight train and I just woke briefly. Neighborhood looks a little rough, but we never had an issue with crime this year or last.
The heat works fantastically as does the water heater. Plentiful spare linens/blankets, towels/washcloths. Dish soap, two dishwasher packets (save one for checkout), roll of paper towels included. Large refrigerator. Just a perfect little rental and we look forward to a third stay here! Thanks, Joanna!"

Stayed one night",Joanna’s place was a great option for us. We had everything we needed for a weekend visit for the ECU game. The train is close to the property but we were expecting to hear it based on other reviews. There were noisy neighbors but that could have been an exception. Nothing that would keep us from staying again. Joanna charges a reasonable cleaning fee which puts the price point more comparable to one night at a hotel but with much more room and privacy. The pull out bed in the 2nd bedroom was very comfortable with the memory foam topper. We had everything we needed for a great stay.

Ron and Fee graciously welcomed us the day after our arrival (because we arrived after dark), and gave us a tour of their beautiful property. They are a very friendly couple yet allowed us our privacy during the rest of our stay. My only complaint would be that the mattresses were too hard leaving me with a back ache until I started sleeping on the couch. If they replace the mattresses I will definitely be back."

We’ll be back soon."

Stayed a few nights","A true gem ! Tranquil and beautiful surroundings quickly strip the stresses away and afford you a place unwind. Ron, the host, went above and beyond with quick responses to our questions prior to our booking, directions, tips and a wealth of information about the property and amenities.
The home was spotless, instantly giving you a sense that pride is taken in the upkeep, cleaning and safety of the property.
From a well-equiped kitchen to comfortable beds to a fire pit / grill on the back terrace overlooking the pond, you are left wondering how quickly you can book another stay to return.
We all left recharged and rejuvenated."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed ringing in the new year at Dos Equis Ranch. It was a secluded escape, and our dogs loved exploring around the cabin. We had plenty of firewood to keep us cozy with the cold rain. The kitchen had all of your basic pots, pans, plates, and salt and pepper. You may want to bring your own cooking spray/oil, more seasonings, and foil though. We would love to come back and explore more in nicer weather!"

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for a special spot that will help you unplug from the hustle of everyday life, be sure to check this place out.
The property is gorgeous, the cabin is cozy and has everything you need, and Ron was so great! We even got a special tour of the land as soon as we arrived on site. Loved that we could bring the pup as well!
Side note, if planning to use the kitchen and cook all your meals, I would plan ahead & bring all ingredients with you. The closest grocery store was about 40 minutes away.
Would definitely go back!"

Stayed a few nights",Great and secluded place for us and our dogs. We enjoyed fishing the ponds.. Just had to be careful of the unknown neighbor dogs hanging around sometimes. Did not know how they would act around us or our dogs. Also maybe some issues with the hot water heater as we had cold water.

Stayed a few nights",Beautiful cabin but can not swim and fish there unless you like cattails and snakes and moss and algae. To far to get medical attention if get hurt there. Not for seniors. Very hazardous. Unlevel and rocks in floor and patio stick up and you trip or stub toes. Very nice for just to sleep and enjoy quiet.

Stayed a few nights","Great place on a very secluded ranch. We are a 50 yo couple just looking for a quite place to escape and cool off by some water. Ron's place hit the spot! The pier and water side patio was a great place to relax and the pond was a wonderful place to float. We joked that our dog took us with her on vacation. We all loved walks around the ranch and a swim to cool off. No TV or wifi so it is a good place to unplug, but it does have a good stereo/radio w speakers inside and outside so dust off and bring your favorite CD's"

We were able to fish and hike around the many ponds. The cabin had everything we needed and had great views. Would definitely recommend and plan on staying again in the future!

Stayed with kids","I simply cannot say enough good about this place!
If you’re looking for a break from the daily grind, this is definitely it! You will more than likely have cell service, but if you’re on your phone for unnecessary reasons, you’re missing out on the fun! There are more ponds than you can fish in a week, endless opportunities to see wildlife, and no reason to not explore the great outdoors.
It rained every day of our four day stay, but regardless of that, we all had the best vacation ever! I’ve never seen our three boys so happy!
We took our four wheeler and trail bikes and rode different trails everyday, but still didn’t see all of the property. I spent mornings on the front or back porch, enjoying the peace and quiet.
There’s honestly just too much to list!
Ron is an absolutely fantastic host! Such a great spirit, amazingly helpful and thoughtful, and so easy to work with!
We can’t wait for the many future trips we plan on making back to this amazing property!"

Stayed a few nights","The perfect getaway, close enough to the city but far enough that you can’t hear the traffic. Dos Equis Ranch was exactly as we had hoped. Thankfully we had access to an ATV so exploring the vast acreage was part of the adventure. At night, the only thing louder than our crackling fire was the sound of the frogs.
The cabin is equipped with everything you will need, including a full kitchen, washer and dryer, and hot shower. For those that need to stay connected, your phones will likely get full service out here like ours did. But if you’re on your phone, you’re missing the point. Cabin life is the good life.
Ron and his family are welcoming and there to help if you need them. If you get a chance, as him about the work he did on the land. The man has lived two lifetimes and he’s not close to done. Can’t wait to get back out there and continue our conversation."

We loved the pond & deck outside. Water was clear and refreshing with the heat. We will definitely be back when it’s cooler and walk around the property more. It’s HUGE!
