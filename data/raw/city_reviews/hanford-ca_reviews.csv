Stayed a few nights","As a Hanford local, this was the perfect place to stay to for a wedding weekend (while not staying with family who lives there). We were able to see family and have a place to come ""home"" to at the end of the day to unwind and rest. My boyfriend said he wished the bedroom had a cubby/table on each side of the bed but a small detail for a great place to stay. We did run to Savemart up the street to pick up some K-cups & creamer for anyway who is more particular about their morning coffee. Super conveniently located in town and hearing the train at night brought back lots of childhood memories for us. The stay was very comfortable and we'd stay here again in the future. The ZenDen was truly that and we are grateful to have stayed there. Brittany was super responsive and a great host. Couldn't her place recommend more!"

Stayed a few nights",Totally worth the price! We had a friend coming too so it was as so perfect getting this house than getting 2 motel rooms for 2 days. Keurig coffee maker was so handy! Had everything we needed. Loved the marshmallow cooker. Had everything there to make S’mores! Had lots of games inside and on the outside patio! Loved the fireplace with chairs around it. The succulents on the patio just made you feel like you were at home!

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed at Brittany’s house multiple weeks for a work project at the courthouse. it beats the other Airbnbs I’ve stayed in locally. The house has a great layout and is very user-friendly.
A very good option if you’ve got a small group or even some extra people, I highly recommend it and by far is much more comfortable than Hotel stays locally as well.
Thanks for the great accommodations and great responsive communication !"

The beds are bare minimum for beds and we ended up cutting our stay short by one night because the beds were so uncomfortable. The sheets on both beds wouldn’t stay on either and were poor quality. The price is very low for the stay, but you get what you pay for."

I enjoyed the pool, it was very fun and for the weather, it was all I needed. The host was incredibly nice and whenever I needed help, I will instantly get the support that I needed. This is absolutely a 5 start place. Also, the neighborhood was extremely safe and people around were very friendly. I truly loved staying there :)"

We were unable to sleep because a train comes by almost hourly 24/7 and has to blow the horn due to crossing over a street which really disturbed our sleep every night. I also have to say the bed was really uncomfortable it was caved in the middle and felt like I was sleeping in a sink hole. The temperature in the house was also very difficult to regulate. It was very cold and very hot. Adorable home great location to downtown.

The one drawback was the proximity to the train tracks. The train runs at all hours of the day and night and they are always generous with the horn!
The TV had Live TV, the kitchen was stocked with everything you could need and the bedrooms had plenty of blankets and pillows."

There is a bit of noise from the train and traffic close by the benefit of the closest to amenities makes it worthwhile .

I did notice a slight musty smell, likely due to its age, but the house itself looks quite modern thanks to its updated fixtures. There's a train station that runs directly behind the house, so if you're not accustomed to train noise, this might not be the best choice for you. Despite that, my overall experience was great, and I definitely plan to stay here again in the future."

It was just me so I can only comment on the master bedroom bed but it was definitely comfy and the TV was a nice touch. As the host notes, this home is *right* on the train track. It is loud enough to vibrate the floors a bit 😅 and the train passes roughly every couple hours. While this didn’t bother me much, it was enough to make my work calls hard to hear for a moment. But overall it was a great home, nice layout, and I’d definitely stay again."

Also that it was pet friendly & for the early check-in (although I think the cleaning got rushed because of it). Host was an excellent communicator - very responsive & helpful. Very much enjoyed the back patio & backyard space.

Stayed with kids",A cute house that was easy to get into and what we needed. The kitchen was clean and the bedrooms clean and comfortable. The only downside was the ac was turned off before we arrived and it was 88 degrees inside when we got there. It took a while to cool down enough so we could sleep. I understood from James that keeping the ac off when guests aren't there is common. Hopefully in the hot summer months this practice changes. It's a lovely home.

Stayed about a week","James responded very quickly when i messaged him. He is just starting the AirBnb so there are minor issues compared to others i have stayed at but nothing that would make me not stay here again.
The place has a lot of space and a large backyard and large outside table but way too cold this time of year to take advantage of it.
Couple of drawbacks hopefully he will correct for your stay. One being the dining room table is a smaller round one which only seats 4. Kitchen utensils were also a little sparse.
Beds were comfortable with very warm comforters. He also has central air and heating. Driveway can park 2 cars as well as street parking.
The house is in a safe neighborhood and can be an issue in Hanford.
Another review mentioned the school directly behind the house but that was a non-issue. A little louder during the day if you were in the kitchen or that side of the house during school hours but that was it.
I would definitely stay here again to visit family in Hanford."

James was super sweet and very accommodating! He promptly replied to all my messages and is so friendly. The check in process was very easy, and the home is adorably decorated. The couch was so comfy, my hubby was going to sleep there instead, LOL!
If James allows 7 ppl, I would book his place again next time.

Stayed one night","We were in town overnight for a family event and needed a place to stay for one night only. We were thankful James’ place was available and accepted overnight stays.
There area was quiet and the house was relatively clean. It is an older home with some updates, but had some of the quirks you find in older homes.
We didn’t utilize the kitchen or backyard so we can’t comment on those areas, however the home was spacious enough for the four of us and was very pet friendly.
Our main complaint was that the lock on the sliding glass door leading to the back yard was broken. A stick was provided to help with this and prevent anyone from getting in.
Other than that, it was a nice place to stay."

The accommodations and amenities were perfect for our family of 7. There was only one down-side to the property - that it is fairly close to a train crossing. The train blows its horn at all hours, which makes the nights difficult for light sleepers. I would suggest bringing a sound machine to cover the noise. But other than that, it was a great place to stay and we loved the rural area and seeing all farms along the drive to Sequoia."

Stayed one night","For starters this home is beautiful inside and out. There’s a nice big backyard for your dog or small gathering. Also, our host was extremely accommodating. He allowed us to check in 2 hours early and check out 2 later for free. We had a few questions and his property manager was adequately responsive and helpful. All in all this was a great place to stay and a great host. I’ll definitely recommend them for any and everyone. I’ll definitely be staying there again next time I’m in the area. Thanks again"

There are thoughtful extras like a well stocked coffee/snack bar and refrigerator, nice linens, toiletries and any kitchen items you might need. I have had no need for doing laundry but facilities are there.
The host has been VERY prompt and friendly with any questions I’ve had and giving information before I arrive.
I’m sure I will reserve this home again if it is available on my next visit to Hanford."

My only note would be that the train runs 5-6 times a night and the whistle can be very loud. We were able to sleep through it, but a family with little kids may want the heads-up."

There is coffee included and even a spice rack, among other amenities. I had just left a bad situation at another property and coming to this one was refreshing. The only downside is this house is it's on a very busy street, so vehicles drive fast and loud down it every night: I had trouble sleeping the first night but then got used to it. Hanford is a cute town-- some must eats are: Superior Dairy ice cream, Me N' Ed's Pizzaria, Cisneros tacos, the chicken kebob sub from Boston Pizza and a lavender vanilla iced latte from Hola Cafe Cito!"

We said we we’re traveling with an infant. We had packed a pack n play pin,but we’re surprised when we checked in to see a crib set up and a pack and play in the closet.Nice touch. We would definitely rent again when we are in the area."

Our kids loved the bunkbeds they are super convenient for a fun experience for kids. The master bedroom is so spacious as well as the bathroom included inside. I think the pictures don’t do it justice this place is amazing. The kids really enjoy the backyard as well. It’s a large size and there is no clutter around it. It was an amazing time.

House had everything ready to go! Great yard & great cul-de-sac location. We should have brought kids razor skooters & skates as it perfectly flat & sidewalks. Backyard was nice & had outdoor furniture, bbq & covered patio with an area of grass. A great recommendation for this place would be a propane fire pit! Aaron was very accomadating for our group (10 of us) and was very assessible through app messages & phone. The house had wifi & roku tvs. No complaints whatsoever!"

Stayed with kids","LOVED Aaron's property! It was beautiful, spacious,clean, comfy and in friendly (&quiet) neighborhood.
We all absolutely enjoyed our stay in Aaron's home . Everything was so simple, available and clean . Aaron was so easy to reach with our questions as we were not familiar with the area. There was enough space for everyone to be together or in their own areas. The back yard is a great size for gathering, relaxing, family games or enjoying your BBQ needs. The rooms were perfect for us. I had my two younger children and they were able to sleep in our room with no problem ( there was a bunk bed in the room). Kitchen was fully stocked. Ice and water available as a feature on the refrigerator .
For our stay the weather was a little cooler than our normal vacations. We were very grateful everything worked in the home as it should. We were able to warm up the home with no problem. We'd absolutely book again if in the area! Aaron and his home receive a 10/10 from us 👍"

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by a clean and spacious environment that instantly felt like home. The cleanliness of the property great, with every corner meticulously maintained, providing a safe and comfortable space for our family.
The spacious layout of the Airbnb provided ample room for our family to relax and unwind together. Whether we were lounging in the living area, cooking meals in the well-appointed kitchen, or sharing stories around the dining table, every moment spent together felt special.
The responsiveness of the host was quick. They were prompt and helpful in answering any questions I had, which greatly contributed to my overall satisfaction with the experience. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a hassle-free and enjoyable stay."

The kitchen was well stocked. The house is very bright with only blinds on the windows so if you need it dark to sleep having a sleep mask is a good idea.
The home is in a new neighborhood and felt very safe. The neighborhood is very clean and quiet. We didn’t need the backyard but it’s spacious and nice too. Thank you Carolyn for taking such good care of your home for us to enjoy!

This house really felt at home from the comfy couches to the beautiful landscaping outside. Carolyn’s home makes us want to buy a home in Hanford! The beds were firm and the couches were comfy.

Stayed with a pet","This was our 2nd stay at our🩴""Hanford HideAway"".🩴This truly has become our Home Away from Home! The beds are suuuuper comfortable, the sheets crisp, white and clean.
There is a giant brown sectional with a chaise lounge and recliner...can you say Heavenly??
We spent every day, ALL day,🏖️ playing and swimming in the sparkling pool. 👙🥽. (this time there were a bunch of 🐝BEEs.. they didn't bother us)
Kitchen👩🏼‍🍳has some spices and is easy to cook in, with a nice dining nook for meals or board games🎲 Monopoly, Clue...
2 LARGE bathrooms with 🚾separate 🚽toilets. The Primary has a HUGE jetted tub. 🛀🏽Our 10yr old granddaughter didn't want to get out!
There are LOTS of bath and pool towels
All in all we ♥️LOVE♥️this house (probably shouldn't say that out loud for fear that others will scoop it up!) We will be back again, and again, and again..."

All of my family enjoyed their stay as well. I would definitely recommend. Thank you again for having us, Beatriz!"

Stayed with a pet","Home away from home! We absolutely LOVED this place!
I am temporarily on a walker (pending hip and knee replacement) so getting around and into the pool was critical to me booking. I reached out to Beatriz asking about the pool entrance grab bar (she indicated it was currently broken). I asked her if she would be willing to repair it and I would book the house immediately. She agreed and I booked on the spot. She then sent me a picture showing me that the repairs were being done. Her communication was amazing!
PROS: large layout, immaculate, couches are older but SOOO comfortable!!, large pool, super comfy bed, large grass and dirt area for our Fur Babies, open concept, modern appliances in an updated kitchen and perfect house for families, couples and puppers!
CON: Pool is right under 2 large palm trees so there was a lot of debris in the pool (but nothing we couldn't take care of with the skimmer). All in all we will KEEP COMING BACK to our ♥️HOME AWAY FROM HOME♥️"

You cannot be in Hanford and not hear it…no matter where you are. Inside the house I barely heard it. We had a few problems. The fridge went out. They came and addressed right away. The pool cleaner was not working right. They came and fixed it. Very nice people to deal with! Never made you feel like you were a bother! I would not hesitate to stay again."

Stayed with kids","Overall the Airbnb was mediocre. We did come over Memorial weekend so the trash had not been picked up so overfilling garbage greeted us as we drove in. There was sweet potato peels left on the ground in the backyard. There were fake magnetic eyelashes under one of the beds! All I wanted after a week worth of travel was to take a bath in the jacuzzi tub but the handle came off. Looking at it, it looked like there was calcification and deterioration. It was like 10pm so sadly I just showered. I let Beatrice know the next day. Her handyman said it was intentionally broken. And she wanted to charge me. I was shocked and disappointed! Both for not being able to have a nice bath and for trying to a charge me!"

The train went through 4 times the first night. we went and bought earplugs for the whole family, but we could still hear the trains. they went through 3-5 times per night. There was also an issue with what the host called “water bugs” inside the house. they sent someone out to treat but didn’t seem to help. If the bug issue has been taken care of, I will say this home was spacious, plenty of room for the 6 of us. Located in a quiet neighborhood. It was nice having a pool."

Stayed with kids","I know why you’re here. You want to know if the pool is big and if the neighborhood is quiet.
Yes to both.
Clean? Absolutely.
It’s only 7-8 miles away from Lemoore. If you have an electric car that’s NOT a Tesla, you can charge your car about 10-15 minutes away from the house at a school with ChargerPoint. It’s always empty and nobody bothers you and it’s cheap.
Don’t park your car in the driveway on the days they water the grass. The water spots are gonna be hard to get off your car. Learned the hard way.
The backyard has a nice vibe to it. The only thing you may not like is the camera that is directly on the pool. But we’re a bunch of guys so we didn’t really care. I know I look like a whale in water and if they wanna look and be entertained I’m okay with that
Seriously though, the owners didn’t bother us or make us feel like anything weird was going on and if there was a challenge, they live close, so they show up to make sure you’re good.
You’ll love the house and oh my gad the A/C is ice cold even when it’s 109 outside. I’m telling you, they don’t make air conditioners that get that cold anymore so I was really really impressed. You’ll have a hard time choosing between staying in the A/C or getting in the pool.
AND THE TUB!!! Really big deep soaking tub, also a great highlight.
We enjoyed our stay"

Stayed a few nights","Reviews are very important to me. Especially when I am going out of town and deciding where to stay and what to eat, so I do read a lot of them and put a lot of thought into the ones I write as well.
I would like to start off by saying that Beatriz was extremely helpful and communicated very well with me. She was very quick to respond to my messages and I really appreciate that.
This house is beautiful and in a great location when you first drive up and go inside. I read all of the great reviews of the quiet neighborhood and how clean the house was. So I had high hopes. I am sure the pool is a big selling point of this house, especially during the summertime. It was over 100 each day we were here, so the pool was great.
I will start with the location. The neighborhood is gorgeous and it was close to shopping, food and the baseball field we had to get to every day. However, it wasn't all that quiet. If you are a light sleeper, you might want to rethink this house. There is a very loud train, complete with whistles close by that seems to pass once every hour or so including during the middle of the night. I was woken up many times during my 3 night stay by this train. If that doesn't bother you, then location and noise won't be a problem.
A big issue with the house would have to be the locked A/C. While she was quick to lower the temp when I messaged her and she did ask what I would like it to be set at. Me and my daughter were extremely uncomfortable during the night. It was set to about 75 the whole time and didn't go lower then 73. At night it was much to hot, and I wasn't about to message her at 2 in the morning to lower it. The A/C is something that you kind of need to be able to adjust to see what is comfortable. I understand the idea of energy saving and have no problem with that, but having to ask to have that adjusted seems a bit outrageous.
The pool was gorgeous and welcome in the heat but plan to take the time to clean it each time you get in. There are two large palm trees above the pool that continuously drop pods and things in the pool all day. If that doesn't bother you then don't worry about it but there was quite a bit. There was a automatic pool cleaner that seemed to get quite a bit sucked up, but you could see a lot of pods collected on the bottom of the pool all the time.
I don't recommend walking around barefoot. The wood floor, especially in the living room, has a lot of spots where the planks are separating from each other and sinking in and will easily pinch feet.
The water in the kitchen faucet got lukewarm at best, making me wonder how clean the dishes could possibly get.
My biggest issue was probably the fact that we found 2 cockroaches on two nights in a row. I did alert her and she offered to have someone come that day but we were leaving the next day and not home at the time. So I do appreciate her offering. We shook all of our things out and checked them well before putting them in our car because that is definitely something I do not want to bring home with me.
The problem with this is that she has guests leaving at 10 and checking in at 3 and that is not enough time to have a house completely fumigated to make sure that the problem has been fixed. I understand wanting quick turnaround to maximize profit but it might be better to give yourself a day in between stays to address things this important and to make sure the house is as clean as it should be. If I were the guests coming in today after my checkout I would be upset to know something like this.
There was also piles of hair stuck under the wall in the master bedroom and the light fixture in the guest bathroom was filled with dead bugs.
I really didn't want to leave such a negative review but it seemed each day things kept piling up. The house is beautiful when you walk in and I appreciated the space and being able to cook my kids breakfast each morning. I hope the time is taken to address the issues. In such hot weather, pests thrive, so it is extremely important to make it as clean as possible each time. This is another reason that A/C is important.
I appreciated the kitchen utensils and very nice refrigerator and stove. The firepit was also really great for s'mores. There is only one small TV in the living room, so I brought a small one. With 2 teenage boys, my daughter and me we weren't going to agree on something to watch.
I really do think this house has a lot of potential and we did enjoy the family time out of town but it was nice to get back to the 75 degree weather on the central coast."

Stayed with a pet","While overall, my partner and I had a good trip, there was many downsides to this Airbnb. The pool was pretty much its saving grace. We loved having a pool to swim in and the layout of the home is nice. However for anyone bothered by dirty, warm, pest-ridden airbnbs with uncomfortable beds and getting their clean car stained with hard-water sprinklers maybe read below.
Locked A/C: When we arrived, the house was uncomfortably warm and we asked the host to lower the temp. She asked what temperature we would like and we responded. She then ignored us for the rest of the stay and only lowered the temp by 3 degrees. If I’m paying to stay at an Airbnb, I find it childish to lock the A/C, especially for a two night stay.
Dirty: I’m surprised the Airbnb has so many reviews for how clean it is because… it’s not that clean. Handles felt gross to touch. There was other peoples hair all over the place. Bathroom drawers had leftover toothbrush box trash, and dust/dirt and hair. There were used hair-ties with gross hair left on the tub in the master bathroom. When we tried the Jets in the jetted tub, the tub water got DIRTY, so that obviously isn’t clean regularly. The shower in the master bedroom also had mold, which was discomforting. Lastly, we wiped up some drops of water from the floor and the paper towel turned black… so the floors obviously are not mopped/steamed after guests.
Ants: We had dog food in the kitchen and in the morning our area was swarmed with ants. This does not happen in treated homes, only homes that already have ant problems. There were ant traps in the house, so they obviously know this is a problem, but aren’t actively dealing with it. We now have to throw away our extra dog food in fear of bringing ants into our house. Would’ve appreciate the warning to lock up all food, to at least have been aware of this issue. We could’ve dealt with it, if it was communicated.
Checkout discrepancy: My partner and I remembered checkout time being at 11 am, especially since the info binder in the house says 11. Luckily, we rechecked the app the night before because it was at 10 am. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it I’ve never had a checkout that inconveniently early before.
Bed: The hosts did not invest a lot of money in stocking this home and it shows. The sheets were so scratchy and itchy that it was irritating to my partners legs and affected her sleep. The pillows felt like the $2 pillows you get at Walmart. We did not sleep great. I recommend you bring your own blankets and pillows, which is unfortunate when paying to stay somewhere.
Sprinklers: While there was a garage, we were never given information on if we could use it or not. There was no info on using it, so we parked in the driveway. On the day of leaving, the sprinklers turned on and our car got covered and I also got wet from loading the car. There was no signage or communication that these sprinklers were going to be on, so I find that incredibly rude. Especially since the checkout is so early? Just wait to turn on the sprinklers until the guest leave. Now the car is covered in hard-water spots. People who take pride and care of their car understand. Could’ve been warned to move our car and we would’ve had no problem doing so.
Wasn’t the worse stay, I wasn’t planning on writing this negative of a review. But every small negative detail kept adding up and really affected our stay. We believe other guests should know."

Beatriz was an excellent host quick in communications and always willing to answer any questions that may arise.
Only issue was we were surprised to see rusty hot water running in the bathtub and sinks.
We were guessing a new water heater might be needed, but heard also that Hanford water is less than desirable. All else was five star!"

It had everything we needed for the entire 2 week period. It was clean, had plenty of space, tons of things for my kids to do, a huge yard for my dogs, quiet, peaceful, and uninterrupted. The neighbors were great and even reached out to Guest Equity’s to let me know my trunk was left open! Guest equity’s kept in touch to make sure check in went well, made sure everything was good while we were there, left great checkout instructions, and were generally great with communication. The furniture and linens were comfortable and clean, the kitchen was fully stocked with cookware and clean, the bathrooms were clean and had everything we needed. It was a great house, great experience, and great host."

Also we can tell the cleaning crew was in a rush because there was cleaning residue left over on the counters, sinks, mirrors, etc. Also walking into the backyard we immediately noticed that the grill was extremely dirty and unusable. Backyard furniture was also dusty. We also wished there were more trash bins around the house. We only had one trash bin in the kitchen. No trash bins in the any of the 4 bathrooms.

Our church reserved this house to host several of our missionaries for a ""homecoming"" and a time to rest and refresh before returning to the ends of the earth to share Jesus. This was the perfect place. We joined them for one evening to BBQ and pour into them. The house is well stocked: beach towels, cooking items, etc.
When Michelle realized that they would be coming and going over the course of their time there, she took it upon herself to make additional house keys to accommodate our guests.
Thank you, Michelle, for being so responsive and kind."

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful time in this home, was ample and very peaceful, the place was very clean and was fully loaded with kitchenware. Linen was clean, had lots of towels, and blankets, bathrooms were very clean. Since we gathered during Thanksgiving, all the appliances were in working order, plenty of silverware, diches and pots. Overall the home was lovely and was very comfortable.
Michelle was very nice and answered all of my questions."

Group trip","So many wonderful things to say about this property, it was so private and peaceful. The gardens are AMAZING. We especially loved listening to all the birds and watching the humming birds while relaxing on the patio. The kids enjoyed the hot tub and we enjoyed the country views. We wish we could have stayed longer!"

Group trip",We had a lovely family get together at Michelle’s place. The place is amazing and has everything you could ask for. We never left the house the whole weekend. The pool was perfect - especially during the heat wave. Everything was clean and well maintained. Michelle is very responsive and helpful. We had so much fun and are thinking about making this a yearly trip!

Group trip","Best Airbnb experience ever! The home and outdoor space were beautiful ( better than pictures present), very spacious, allowing us to entertain out of town guest for a wedding the next day. Plenty of space to relax, as well as privacy if needed. Pool and spa were added bonuses for us! The owner was most gracious, even getting extra items we needed, as well as very flexible to our arrival and departure schedule! Thank you for a fantastic experience!"

Stayed with kids","Had a wonderful stay! The backyard had great entertainment with various seating, speaker for music, two grills, and pool/jacuzzi with umbrellas for shade. The house is beautiful with unique architecture through out. The owner, Michelle, was easy to communicate with and clear on instructions. If you want to get groceries, I would do so about 30 minutes out so you can hit the larger known stores. There are nearby markets but they might not have what you are looking for. Recommend this place for sure!"
