Stayed a few nights","Check in was easy and no parking inside the garage as it was locked by the host , but you can park right next to it. Apartment is very regular , you don’t get a feel of weekend getaway and it is not private , there are neighbors downstairs and it is not a good place to party , no music after 11:00 PM. There is no private bbq and not much to do outdoor at this location , I definitely feel price is too high for this property with 4 ppl max to sleep in , and for the rules they had , and with neighbors downstairs , nothing much to offer for the guest. Kitchen is not adequate , no dishwasher , no extra trash cans . Not sure what else we can do here if it is not summer. We paid for 3 nights but had to check out a day before out of boredom ."

That was a very special touch. The home is beautifully laid out and the games in the basement were a huge hit with the younger kids. The house was clean and tidy and the kitchen had just about everything we needed to cook a large meal. Having YouTube TV was excellent so that we could watch the football games.
Lynn and Richard responded quickly to my many questions and were very nice.
I would highly recommend this home for a family get together and I hope we can return in the summer to enjoy the large lot, breezeway and lake."

Our family (9), didn't feel crowded at all and thoroughly enjoyed the home. We are looking forward to staying there again in the future. Thank you Lynn and Richard for providing us with a great place to vacation with our family!"

Group trip","Very well kept and managed home away from home. You are 9 minutes away from a marina and sand beach. The house has an amazing fire pit and all the wood one could burn. You are sharing the outdoor space with the owners, however they are very friendly and extended an invitation to join their fire the first night we were there. You will hear doors slamming living over the garage and vehicles coming and going. However it wasn’t excessive or disruptive. You will also hear amazing sounds of nature, possibly see a family of deer, and have a fun conversation with the turkeys that seemed to neighbor us. All in all, this was an amazing stay and we would recommend highly."

We enjoyed every minute we were able to just sit back and have some important family time. The river is visible just over the trees and you can stand on the deck, inhale fresh air and listen to absolutely nothing. The host, Michelle, is sweet, accomidating and on top of things. If you message her for something, she gets right back to you. Thank you for hosting our crazy family and for providing us a place that we could actually be together."

Negatives - Hard to get downstairs due to tight, open spiral staircase is the only access to basement. Stairs not handicap nor physical disability accessible. Small children need supervision due to no handrail/spindles. My 6'3"" son hit head using stairs.
Only usable outside space was on deck. Yard areas rocky and steep, not good for children to play."

Just one word of caution - the only way to access the downstairs space is either via a spiral staircase or slopped exterior path so I wouldn’t recommend the cabin for families with small children or people with mobility challenges.

Stayed with kids","It is as advertised. I would categorize this as a novelty property. There is ample commons space, The kitchen is minimally equipped. This place does sleep 8, however the formula of sleep areas may not be what you are looking for. Pay attention to the photos and how it is set up. The sleeping areas are more like cubicles, which is fine. They are visual private but not sound private. There are 3 queen beds, however two of them are a bunk bed, and one is by itself. The other sleeping area has single bunk beds. The bathroom is acceptable, and the shower had plenty of hot water. There are clothing hooks and a coat rack out front, but nothing to really hang up hang up type clothing. It would be nice to have a wardrobe or something there for that purpose. All and all it had what my family needed. A place to sleep, clean up and eat breakfast. It just isn't the type of property that fits into my family's personality. Plenty of parking close by."

Stayed a few nights",The Lake House was beautiful and met all of our expectations. The kitchen had everything u could possibly want. It was very nice to not have to haul our crockpots from home. There were ample sleeping places and bathrooms. The view was breathtaking and we even saw some deer and turkey. We loved the comfort of the beds and bedding. The Lake House was decorated beautifully with excellent taste. Everyone in our family had a wonderful time and want to go back again next year.

He called it his ""office."" Contributing to our love of the house was the gorgeous view from so many of the rooms. Even though we came for our Thanksgiving celebration and weather was cool, the front deck was enjoyed by all. Thank you for the use of this spacious home and we will plan another visit soon."

We were so close to everything we wanted to do! Also enjoyed this beautiful, spacious home when we just wanted to hang out and relax. Kids loved having the ""magic playroom"" as they called it and checking out the books and games available. Adults enjoyed the pool table, ping pong, patio and deck, awesome coffee bar, the two grills and fire pit. We would definitely recommend this property and would return - hopefully soon!!"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved this house! First of all, it was spotless when we checked in. You could tell that a great deal of care was taken by the cleaning crew, and that they take pride in a job well done. Most properties position the cameras such that the house looks bigger than it is. This house is actually bigger than what the pictures make it appear! We were there with 18 people (including two toddlers), and had plenty of room for meals, sleeping, etc. What helps is that the garage was also spotless, and there were folding chairs and tables in there if needed. The view from the back deck is fabulous! You look directly on to Lewis and Clark Lake. From the deck, you can hear birds, see deer, turkeys, and spectacular night skies. I absolutely would recommend this home to anyone considering a vacation rental.
A real bonus is that the house is a little less than a mile from the beach and boat docks. That was very convenient for us!"

I will definitely be staying at her place next time I am in town!"

There is a bigger town (Yankton) less than 30 minutes away that has more shopping and food options. Overall, this was a nice, quiet stay to get away from work and ""adulting"" 🙂"

The farm is located approximately 1 mile off the highway, an approximate 5 minute drive for the town of Crofton. The cottage has been remodeled and has all the amenities of home including a full kitchen, large screen tv and AC. We enjoyed our coffee on the attached deck as we listened to the birds chirp. Janita and Kevin were friendly and helpful but not obtrusive. Our favorite part was the tour that Kevin gave us of the farm operation, including the meeting of 2 young calves. We highly encourage this Airbnb for special memories and the opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation for Nebraska farm life."

From the view of Lewis and Clark Lake from the front deck and patio, to the nearby Weigand marina, and then the completion of our stay with a round of golf at Lakeview golf course which was just around the corner and down the road from the house, we were able to enjoy the beautiful end of summer weather. But most of our contentment with this visit was spent at the house with good friends in the very comfortable atmosphere, with an easy to work in kitchen, cozy beds, and clean and well stocked bathrooms. Jolynn was quickly responsive to my pre-stay questions, so we felt welcome from the start. This trip was a get-away with old friends, and now I'm eager to return, bringing my family to enjoy this beautiful home and the surrounding area!"

We did not cook, but the cabin has a toaster oven, regular oven and electric range, microwave and dishwasher. The bedrooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The air conditioning was ample and we were very impressed by the size. It is bigger than you’d expect from the photographs. We definitely plan to stay here again the next time we’re in Yankton!"

The hosts thought of everything!
I can honestly say the only downside were the mattresses, in all three rooms. One of my friends slept on the couch the second night hoping to sleep better.
Despite this, I would highly recommend this home when staying in Yankton."

Across the street was an amazing huge pool so if you come in the summer be sure to bring your swim suit. I wish I would have brought mine. The only complaint I have was that the bathroom floor was a bit sticky from the cleaner not being rinsed enough. It was although very clean. In addition, the shower floor is super slick, so much that I slipped and almost fell. I laid an extra washcloth on the shower floor the second time I took a shower which helped.
All in all I would recommend this Airbnb. It is clean, spacious enough and convenient. The access to the home is simple and easy."

There is a park across the street which was great for our dog to get some energy out before our car ride. Room is spacious and bed is comfortable! They’ve got this hosting system down! Will certainly stay again on our next road trip and would recommend to anyone. Thanks for allowing dogs!

Their hospitality, knowledge and advice assisted me in countless ways to enhance my experience both during my stay in their home and in my overall adaptation to a new state and community. I highly recommend them to travelers, but perhaps even more to anyone considering, as I was, the idea of relocating to the area. They are incredibly helpful and insightful on virtually every level concerning Yankton and perhaps a radius that spans hours beyond the Yankton community. I am very appreciative for their hospitality. Finally, I will say that Jamie does not simply give lip service to ‘enhanced cleaning’. She truly does it and her dedication to everyone’s mutual safety is beyond reproach. Many many thanks."

Stayed about a week","We travel 250+ days a year we have been at a lot of different hotels and Airbnbs and not one has been nearly as amazing as this one! Seriously everything about staying at this home was amazing. Sparkling clean, comfortable bed, very nice house and kitchen (they let you use the fridge, all the cooking stuff...) but the best part about this trip was that we gained two new friends and we felt like home the whole week. We are so thankful for the amazing hospitality and new friendship. We have events again in Yankton next year and we will definitely be staying here again. And for the people worried because you need to share the house with others it didn’t bother us at all. You can hangout if you want or you can do your thing. No one ever bothers you. And they also always make sure that the guests are respectful of each other. This is amazing place to stay. Actually the best place to stay! I wish everywhere we go we could stay at the places like this. We can’t recommend this place enough."

Stayed one night",I have been a frequent visitor at Jamie’s Place. I can count on a consistently clean and extremely comfortable room. Jamie is so friendly and always makes my stay special in some way. The Highest compliment that I can pay is to say that I feel like it’s my home away from home.

Jamie is very welcoming and there are always some fun touches. This Christmas season her home and my room were decorated beautifully even down to the Santa shower curtain.

This year I stayed before Thanksgiving and her home was all decorated for Christmas including my room. I even had a Santa Claus shower curtain. and the cookies that she was making for Thanksgiving were absolutely delicious. I highly recommend Jamie’s place.

Stayed one night",I stay at Jamie’s often And it’s so much better than staying at a motel. I don’t have to go through a check in procedure but just use the keypad. I go up to my room and unpack. It’s like going into your own home where everything is convenient. You don’t have to wait for a room to be cleaned. Check out is the same. You just pack your belongings and exit the house just like you’re at home. The most Satisfying part about seeing aunt Jamie’s is that you are seeing in a home and it’s very clean and comfortable.
