Stayed a few nights","We had a great time. We spent most of our time in Madrid during the day and lounging around the dome and deck in the evenings. The Origami in the Garden art exhibit is only minutes from the dome (google it if interested). It opened for the first time this year on our last day, but we did not know it closes at 1pm and missed it. We will be back to check it out. Back to the dome... It had everything we needed. Comfortable bed, little fridge, coffee maker, microwave, the basics... The new deck is a HUGE plus. Very nice. We spent all of our evenings on the deck drinking wine, watching the sunset, talking, and taking pictures. This is the time of year where things start to warming up. During the day the dome was getting very warm, but we spent our days exploring so it was not a big deal. Nights are cool year round so that won't be a problem. I am sure the AC will be available soon just like the guest instructions mention. Trey was very accommodating. I would recommend."

Stayed with a pet","The dome was nothing short of magical - tastefully decorated, clean, and not to mention the absolutely breathtaking surroundings. We felt secluded and in our own corner of the desert which felt so surreal. I chose to spend my birthday weekend here and could not have made a better choice! Trey was incredibly kind via messaging and we had everything we could ever need. While the dome does change temperatures throughout the day/depending on weather, we followed Trey’s instructions to close the curtains during the day (when sunny) and had no problem maintaining a comfortable temperature inside at all times. I would come back in a heartbeat and can’t wait to plan my next visit - if you have any doubts booking just do it!! This was hands down one of my best Airbnb experiences of all time. Overall we left our weekend at the dome feeling refreshed and inspired - it was truly a beautiful experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Trey’s place was so special - it felt like we were immersed in nature, yet had the comforts of home. The price after service, cleaning fees and taxes was higher than 4-star spas in the area, without the amenities. While this didn’t feel like the great value for money, it was fine for a two night stay."

Although didn’t chat with them directly during our stay, the hosts clearly spent a lot of time providing suggestions and giving an overview of the area in their written words provided in the dome! A beautiful oasis and would recommend spending a night out here if you have the chance!"

Stayed one night","This dome was amazing, and even better than imagined. As the owners make clear, it is essentially a luxury tent, but it was windy and snowy out, around 30 at night, and we were quite cozy inside, especially under blankets. Can't personally speak to air cooling capabilities, but I would trust the owners descriptions. They are up front, and accurate with what to expect (and what not to), and they seemed to think of everything you might need here to be comfortable.
My wife and got here close to 10pm at night after a long day of driving, and were expecting to be cold and huddle under the blanket, but we were pleasantly surprised to find the heater on, and the place was extremely comfortable (high 60ish), and extremely cozy without feeling cramped at all.
Also, on our 5 day road trip, this was the only bidet we encountered which was extremely welcome!
10/10, would stay again."

Stayed with a pet","We were woken up at 7:30am loud construction on their property right behind the dome. Their listed quiet hours for guests is til 9am. The construction went on until 5pm. When I reached out, they ignored me and I had to go through Airbnb Support. It seems like they are in the middle of renovating their home, so if you are looking to book the dome soon, you might run into this issue. Private rooms on a host’s property can come with a reasonable amount of noise, however this was deceptive of the host to not inform us about construction from sunrise to sundown.
Very disappointing for the price, but we made the best of our time there and the dome itself is great. I would not recommend this listing for friends staying in Santa Fe and I personally regret giving them my business. Book at your own risk!"

Stayed one night","The dome is such a unique place to stay! The view of the mountain is breathtaking and you get to see the sky full of stars on a good night in the comfort of the dome. It has all the basic amenities you need for a short stay, and it’s close to Santa Fe enough to get some good meals. The decorations are cute and the bed is extremely comfortable on the soft side. The small heater keeps the dome decently warm at night but it gets a little chilly in the morning. Trey was very helpful and accommodating. A wonderful stay in every aspect!"

Stayed with a pet","This stay in Santa Fe is one of 3 major highlights of my long 6 week roadtrip adventure. The dome is magical. The stargazing is incredible and to be 360 degrees surrounded by beautiful mountains and hills, watching the clouds move and mists settle, rise and roll back across the vast landscape is something very special. The energy in this place is other-worldly good. Trey is a great host! Went out of his way to make my time easy and stress-free, quickly responded with helpful info when asked, and overall just very pleasant to communication. The bed is comfy, shower is great, WC perfectly convenient and nicely done - especially when you realize your really camping in a dome, and little kitchen has all you need for a basic quick snack or sip. I love this spot and loved my two nights in the dome. I would love to return!"

The wifi worked great and even though there was no TV I was able to watch the Lions win their first playoff game in 32 years on my laptop!
My dog Bowie had a great time, too. She spent the whole time looking out the dome windows."

Trey was responsive, his instructions were clear and thorough, and it was obvious that he and his partner care deeply about their guests’ experience and the quality of their stay.
Would definitely return when next in Santa Fe! Thank you, Trey!"

The dome it’s self was very unique and whimsical feeling. We chose a very cold night for our stay but we were plenty warm inside. It was not a simple Air BNB or hotel room, it was an experience. It may not be for everyone but it was perfect for us.
The owners have obviously put a lot of thought, time and effort into creating this destination - and from the looks of it they are continuing to make updates and improvements to the property. Great concept!"

Stayed one night","The location is truly one-of-a-kind, surrounded by ancient canyons and offering panoramic views of every mountain chain in the region. Waking up to the sight of those majestic mountains is a memory I'll cherish forever.
The glamping dome itself is a work of art. It's cozy, well-equipped, and exquisitely decorated. The king bed was comfortable, temperature was perfect and tons of great artwork throughout. The champagne split was a nice touch. Whether you're a nature lover or just in need of some relaxation, this spot has it all.
The hosts provided valuable recommendations for local activities and dining, enhancing the overall experience. Their dedication to ensuring our comfort did not go unnoticed.
I can't recommend this Airbnb enough. It's the coolest spot in the Santa Fe area, and I can't wait to return for another magical stay on those 8 private acres. When they finish the deck, it will be a great outdoor space to sit and view the stars. Thank you for sharing this gem!"

Stayed one night","I could not have imagined a better experience staying at Trey’s Super Dome. Incredible views, so many amenities (especially for basically a tent), easy to follow directions for check-in and check-out. Be sure to turn out the dome lights at night and sit outside to enjoy the night sky with minimal light pollution - breathtaking. During our stay, we saw that they are currently working on building a lookout deck which seems like it’ll be an incredible new feature for future guests! The only slight misunderstanding on our part was that the house that Trey and his wife stay in is closer than expected - like in their backyard pretty much - BUT still absolutely private enough and this did not negatively affect our stay, it might just be nice to have some additional pics to set clearer expectations. I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience in the wilderness and we look forward to maybe returning in the future if the opportunity presents itself!"

Stayed a few nights","First impressions were a little rough, the tent was HOT when we arrived at 5pm and we were worried it was going to stay that way through the night but 2 hours later and it had cooled off substantially. The views are incredible, probably the most beautiful sunset I’ve ever seen. We loved sitting outside watching the sunset and looking at the stars. We even saw a star link satellite that looked like a snake of stars going across the night sky. (Pro tip bring camping chairs or buy some at target when you get there) it’s so beautiful but having a comfy place to sit outside would be amazing! The inside of the tent is cozy. Laying on the comfy couch with a wall of stars was magical, and waking up to pink cloud sunrises was my favorite part. Overall it was a great experience."

Stayed with a pet","By far the most unique place we’ve stayed! I chose this place for mine and my partner’s anniversary and we absolutely loved it! We have 3 large dogs so vacationing can be difficult for us, but being able to bring our four legged family members made this trip even that much better! Trey recommend some gorgeous nearby hikes and places to explore which we really appreciated considering we weren’t familiar with the area! We got to watch a spectacular lightening show with the best possible view on our first night, hiked the Cerillos Hills State Park the next day and got to fall asleep stargazing in the comfort of the dome to end our last night’s stay. The dome itself was very clean, wouldn’t even be able to notice if any pets had stayed there in the past! It was well equipped with the essentials we needed and had a very cozy feel to it! Overall this was a really wonderful stay, and Mr. Trey and his wife are amazing hosts!"

Stayed with a pet","Staying at Trey's SuperDome was an absolute delight! I can't recommend it enough. The tent itself was stunning, offering a unique and cozy experience. The highlight was definitely the breathtaking view of the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Waking up to the sight of wildlife and being surrounded by nature was incredibly refreshing. The sunset was a magical spectacle, painting the sky with vibrant colors. Although it was a bit hot during the day, as soon as the sun went down, it was the perfect temperature. Overall, a truly memorable stay, and I would give it a well-deserved 5-star rating!"

Stayed one night","The Geo Dome would have been amazing but there was a heatwave (96 degrees) and the air conditioning wasn't working so we had to leave because it was probably 120 degrees inside. If the temp is over 75 outside, I would be careful if you are heat sensitive. We were so disappointed because we were looking forward to seeing the stars. It was very cute and clean and easy to get to. Just don't go if temps are high. Trey switched out the portable a/c to try and remedy the problem and was communicative, but it just couldn't be cooled at that point."

Stayed with a pet","Really great stay! The location is remote and beautiful. We needed a place to crash on our move to CO and it was perfect! Breathtaking views and host was very responsive! Bed is super comfy and the place was clean and has everything you need!
Like the other reviews mentioned, this is definitely a glamping experience. IE remember the elements still play a factor. The dome was very hot until about 8pm, which the AC helped with a little bit but it was still very warm. But again, it’s a giant plastic Dome so that’s to be expected in July. Just know what kind of experience you a getting and adjust expectations accordingly
I give everything 5 stars except for the value we paid which I think is 4. While it’s a really great and unique stay, I did feel that the interior could be upgraded for the price we were paying. Just having nice furniture and upgraded amenities would be the cherry on top.
Perfect little get away that’s not too far but far enough! Would recommend and stay again!"

Stayed one night","Before booking I read everything about the place & looked at the pictures, I knew that we were gong to be in for an entirely different experience than ever having , so I really wanted to be open minded. I'm sorry to say the Dome was just not for us. When we got inside it was so terribly hot in there. It would have been nice for the host to have turned on the a/c before we arrived or at least reached out to us & asked if we would like it on. The pictures of the inside looked a lot prettier & cleaner than it was in person. I took my dogs & was terrified they were going to fall off the cliff/mountain anytime I had to take them out. There wasn't any place to walk with them. For the price we paid I feel like it could have been cleaner & fresh smelling. The couch was very uncomfortable & the only place outside to sit to see ""the view"" was a hard wood flat bench."

Stayed a few nights","Worst experience I’ve ever had. Please take lots of pictures of your stay because he takes no responsibility for his dirty location and says you’re the problem. Glad I took lots of pics and got my money back from AIRB&B because he was not going to help. Towels were stained, bugs on photos and looks like he uses the building for storage. No door on bathroom and he leaves the location hot (didn’t have AC on prior to our arrival). I think he has video camera inside because I never complained about the TV and he messaged me basically calling me an idiot for not being able to work his TV. Strong gas smell has me worried for future visitors safety and sewer smell as well. Prison down the road but he leaves the door wide open for arrival. Freaky location, poor host - do not recommend. Thank God for AirB&B customer service because Trey isn’t it. I wish him well but wow, it was not for us. See his responses on other reviewed for anyone making any recommendations. Good luck future visitors."

Stayed one night","This dome is such a cute & secluded stay with an AMAZING view! The owners were very transparent in the description which is much appreciated. Dogs are allowed at the location so be aware, there was dog hair all over the couch. My husband and I left with our blankets and clothes covered in it(it was kind of a let down to us considering the price was so high due to “cleaning fees for dogs”) but it was mentioned in the description so we weren’t too shocked. The water does smell bad BUT it was so nice to have an easily accessible toilet and a nice shower available there inside the dome. It is a perfect space for 2 people wanting a unique camp getaway. If you are boujee, this place isn’t for you. It did get hot & dusty but it was expected due to the fact that we were in a dome in the summer, it was windy, and we were located at the end of a cliff surrounded by dirt. I would 100% recommend this stay but really push to read the description as this location is not suitable for all people"

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I spent a night at the SuperDome on our way back home from a car trip through the southwest. Maybe one small regret was our choice to spend just the one night in Santa Fe. Situated in the back of the property, from inside the dome it is nearly impossible to see any other building, letting you feel like you have the whole desert to yourself.
Being able to curl up on the couch watching the sunset and stars come out at night will stand as one of my favorite memories of the trip. We’re seriously considering coming back and staying a little longer in the next couple years."

Stayed with a pet","By far the coolest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! My fiancé proposed to me the night before we stayed here while we were out camping on national forest lands. After 2 days in the woods (& rainy nights) we decided to head into Santa Fe and book and Airbnb day of to celebrate surrounded by creature comforts. We had put in several requests around 2 pm to multiple spots (check in for most Airbnbs is usually 3 or 4) and no one was responding and we were exhausted. Trey was the only host who responded to my last minute request IMMEDIATELY and approved our stay, and wow, what a treat!!! The Santa Fe Super Dome is spectacular and offers unparalleled desert views and paths through gorgeous scenery. The walkway from the driveway/parking spot to the dome itself was magical (ample lighting and you’re immediately immersed in breathtaking scenery). The space inside was luxurious and as described/pictured! This made our engagement weekend more magical and romantic than we ever imagined. Thank you Trey."

My only advice to any others passing through for the night -- if you're like me and bring all the things when you're on a road trip, consolidate the necessities into one bag the night before. There is a little walk on a gravel path to the dome (not a big deal at all) that would have a lot easier if I wasn't all over the place with my luggage ."

Stayed one night","The dome is super nice and cozy. It has a wonderful view from the window, everything of the room is perfect. The bed is soft and it has a warm comforter, which provides us a good sleep. The only thing was that it’s a bit hard to find the location. We arrived at 9 pm and it’s dark on the mountain, which makes us can’t recognize where the dome is. We called the owner but he didn’t answer at that time, but fortunately we found it by walking along with a road about 15 minutes later. My suggestion is that maybe for the costumers who’s gonna check in should contact the owner early to avoid the same situation, and I’m sure you will enjoy it."

Stayed one night","Was very overpriced for the lack of comfort and supplies. The dome had only two small heaters and the temperature never went above 50 degrees. It was uncomfortable sleeping because it was so cold. There was also not enough rugs so the floor in the bathroom and throughout the house was ice cold. In addition no house rules, just an old water damaged handout about some local shops to check out.
It was a unique experience, but it shouldn’t be rented out in the winter if the host cannot provide adequate heat. Also the shower was a little dirty with mostly empty toiletries. I just feel the space isn’t represented accurately online and should be marketed as as more of a camping experience than a super dome. At more than $500 a night I would expect a clean shower, full toiletries, newer towels, room temperatures above 50 degrees and up to date amenities."

Sunrise is absolutely beautiful too. Amenities are all in good working condition and the shower is great. Would recommend staying here to anyone. FYI, if you visit in the winter, the stargazing window at the very top of the dome will be covered with insulation to keep the heat in -- but you'll be glad it's there, 'cause it can get veryyy cold outside! Would love to see this place again in the summer :-)"

Stayed one night","Overall a unique experience with a beautiful view of the sandia mountains. While we enjoyed our stay, we question if the one night getaway was truly worth the cost(~500 total). Obviously that judgement is personal and will be dependent on your financial situation. In our opinion we have stayed in a number of Santa Fe airbnbs for much cheaper with similar views. However the dome itself is a unique stay in the Santa Fe area.
Other notes: The bed is very comfy (we slept great), the space is perfectly clean, the pillows are firm/thick (we brought our own thankfully), the temperature was comfortable once the sun went down (stayed in Jan 40-50 degrees outside), the kitchenette really doesn’t have much as advertised, shower is nice."

We especially enjoyed watching the birds swooping around looking for breakfast in the morning. We just stayed one night so we brought our own microwaveable food and just hung out and enjoyed the view without leaving. But Trey had lots of suggestions for places we hope to try while we are still in the area. Loved this!

Stayed one night","As it got darker outside, the room got colder and colder. Two portable heaters and a not so efficient wall mounted heater were clearly not enough for a 10 degree night. I reached out to the host and asked politely if there’s any way we could make the room a little warmer. “No,” the host replied, “That’s what we got. You may have to put sweater on but I find it pretty comfortable”. Other than the heating problem, we also found a leftover exploded frozen Coke in the freezer, a coffee pot with rust on the bottom, a dirty oven, a watery hand soap and a watery body wash. We filed a claim to Airbnb addressing these issues. The next day, the host replied by saying “it is very clear about the fact that it can get cold” and the exploded Coke is “apparently from the guest the night before” and therefore “complimentary”. He even attacked me personally by saying “you probably yell at the front desk clerk when you stay in a hotel and probably talk down to waitresses”. Worst experience EVER."

Stayed one night","The dome is incredible, it’s situated perfectly for unobstructed sunset views, and is easy to get to from Santa Fe. It has full plumbing for a toilet, sink, shower and kitchen, a huge king bed and AC and heating depending on the needs. Check in is contactless. There’s also a sound bar which makes it really atmospheric to have music playing in the dome. My only wish would be for it to be better signposted for the route from the car to the dome. The hosts were so lovely and very responsive. I’ve already had so many friends request the details!"

The stars were amazing while outside in the hot tub. The bedding was above par and comfortable. The house was decorated very minimalist with plenty of room. The house had 2 very large TV’s. The only thing I wish the house had was a wood burning fireplace but the gas fireplace was pretty.

Only complaint is that I specifically chose their place because we wanted a cozy home with a fireplace for a chilly weekend (despite it being the more
expensive option) Fireplace wasn’t working, obviously had something wrong with it.
Sadly the host wasn’t eger to help even though I reached out. Seemed like they thought we didn’t understand the simple instructions. Was a bit disappointed that they stopped responding when I was politely asking for help figuring out the issue. Ultimately it’s only a little thing! Things happen! Overall, well cared for and wonderful spot!"

The space is superb, you’re close to many supermarkets and restaurants, and there is plenty to do in the surrounding area. If you want to stay in, they have everything you need to chill. And of course the hot tub is perfect for this time of year. Excellent place, worth every penny!"

Stayed a few nights","La Casita, a hidden gem in the heart of NM, exceeded our expectations in every way. From the moment we arrived, we knew we were in for an incredible stay. The highlight of our experience was undoubtedly the luxurious hot tub, which provided the perfect retreat after a long day of exploring.
The attention to detail throughout the property was remarkable, and the master bedroom closet was a dream come true for my wife. She couldn't help but envy the organization and spaciousness, making her wish she had one just like it back home.
Our evenings spent indulging in relaxation, cozied up next to the crackling fireplace while enjoying our favorite TV shows, were nothing short of divine. The atmosphere was so warm and inviting, creating the ultimate ambiance for a perfect getaway.
We cannot recommend La Casita enough for anyone seeking an unforgettable Airbnb experience. The combination of comfort, style, and amenities truly made our stay one for the books."

The casita is well located, and peaceful. We prefer bedside, floor and table lamps for reading and ambience. All over head lighting was harsh. There was nothing ""wrong"". However, we wish we had warmer and friendlier contact with the host ahead of time, and during our stay (we have no idea who they are; we never saw a soul). For us, first impressions either warm our hearts and make us feel welcome, or not. Even though the casita was almost ""perfect"", we experienced it as sterile, and without personal warmth."

Stayed about a week","My husband and I stayed for a week for our honeymoon, and the casita was perfect! We loved the minimal, zen feel of the casita- the walls have a beautiful, warm texture that makes you feel enveloped, and reflects light beautifully. The casita was easy to find, and just a few miles from downtown Santa Fe.
Things we loved: SUPER clean, very quiet, comfy furniture, comfy bed, no weird smells inside, extra pillows and blankets, organic toiletries for use, lots of towels, robes & sandals for use, big hot tub, large kitchen with plenty of cookware, big TV, private sun-dappled yard, blackout shade in the bedroom, GIANT closet with drawers & hangers, NO chores to do upon checkout
Things to note: Pillows are feather pillows, so they felt a bit lumpy to us. We had to buy cooking oil, and there are no spices beyond salt & pepper. Dishwasher did not do a great job, so we wound up handwashing most dishes. We had to trap a little desert mouse one night- not a big deal, but we did not realize that leaving the door open for a bit would cause critters to get in. The fireplace does work, but you just have to stand RIGHT in front and hold down the ON button for 12 seconds (we had a little issue getting it to work the first day)"

Communication on check-in and check-out was simple, accurate, and helpful. We loved the hot tub, Adobe aesthetic outside, and the wood accents inside. The coffee closet was well stocked, complete with a grinder and a fantastic metal French press. The king size bed gives plenty of room to spare, as does the walk in closet. Most amenities work well as intended, although the dishwasher didn't clean as well as we'd hoped. Overall, this was definitely a great place to stay, and we enjoyed it very much."

Stayed a few nights","The casita was a gorgeous place to stay while in Santa Fe! While it is connected to a larger portion of the owner’s home, it is completely private. We actually never saw anybody outside the house. The place itself was perfectly clean without a spec of dust anywhere. (Yes, I’m on of those people who look around for it). If the casita wasn’t already great enough, the added finishing touches made it extra luxurious. Every detail was considered down to multiple coffee makers of varying types, to robes and slip on shoes for the hot tub. The bed and linens were soft and cozy and I slept like a baby!
My only complaint is that Uber drivers had difficulty knowing which driveway to enter. This by no means takes away from the perfection of the casita. I would stay here again and definitely recommend to others!"

Just wanted to share a word of caution that Cristiana & Mavrick are very strict in implementing their cancellation policy. I didn't realize quite how bad the wildfires were until slightly after the deadline to cancel with a 50% refund. When I reached out to the hosts, they were firm in not granting me any refund at all, even in the event that someone else rebooked my cancelled dates. In any case, I hope everyone stays safe and exercises caution in these difficult situations!"

Stayed a few nights","Cristiana & Mavrick live in the main house, to which the casita is attached. We never heard or saw them, until we couldn’t figure out the fireplace. They came over and helped immediately. Their place was IMMACULATELY clean, the appliances are top of the line, and all the furnishings were comfortable and beautiful. The natural lighting, fireplace, and private hot tub were amazing - not too mention we were a $10 Uber ride from the best restaurant in New Mexico, while the Casita was somehow totally quiet and felt like a night glamping under the stars."

The decor was our favorite too - not necessary in a rental but added to the feeling of home for us (Mid century modern with touches of upcycle finds and locally-sourced art.)
We loved the customized screen doors that allowed for air flow with screening and a really cool, very unique latch and lock system. Parking was ample and the plants all around had been lovingly cared for. Steve especially enjoyed the lilacs that were in the midst of blooming.
Just a stellar place! We loved it."

Something we loved was the attention to detail to make the space environmentally friendly. Composting, recycling, natural products were provided and plumbing is used that takes into account this desert area. The only drawback of this lovely place was the uncomfortable beds, otherwise it would receive a 5+ star rating. It would be a good idea to arrive at this spot before dark as it can be a bit hard to make sure you are at the right place."

We'd never stayed in this area and wound up liking it better than Museum Hill. On the owner's recommendation, we tried Tune Up Cafe. Excellent food - really fresh and delicious - and without a lot of restaurant pretension."

There were so many little amenities and considerations you don't normally see, from a full drip coffee brewer with actual ground coffee(s) provided, to foam guards around the bed supports so you don't stub your toe. Everything you might want, they have considered and provided. Truly an outstanding Airbnb and we have stayed in many!"

Everything was immaculate and somehow even the bath towels were fluffy and warm and it was all just the perfect thing for a good rest stop for us as we travel to Colorado. I honestly wish we had more time to go around Santa Fe using Barbara’s guest home as our base but we were just traveling through. Her directions were perfect; it was an easy drive up from the main roads. We walked around the property on the trail this morning and that was a lovely way to stretch our legs. The beds were super comfortable and clean and I personally love that they are next to each other so I could keep my kids close. The water is HOT and the shower and bathroom were also spotless; one of the best stays we’ve ever had :)

Bed was comfortable, and I appreciated that the two beds seemed to be slightly different firmness to choose from (I'd say in medium-firm range.). Kitchenette was nice for warming up food, making tea and refrigerating/freezing some basics. Also nice to have the work desk. Good closet for storage. Neighborhood in the hills was lovely and quiet, and stars at night were pretty. Location felt central but tucked away, a short drive to plaza, museum hill, etc. Shower was good and bathroom super clean and spacious + plush towels. The easy walk/hike nearby in Arroyo Hondo open space (right before bridge) was great. Wifi was decent and fine for work (didn't have meetings, so not sure how it holds up for video calls, but I think it would be okay). Driveway to suite was a bit icy/snowy, but my FWD SUV didn't have any problems and driveway is flat. I'd def stay again!"

The views were amazing from the beautiful land, and we were lucky enough to enjoy the solar eclipse on our way out. We can’t wait to book this place again the next time we come through Santa Fe!"

Stayed one night","This place was easy to get to from downtown, and yet it was remote enough to provide a quiet respite. It's remote enough and dark enough to see the stars. The night I was there we had a full moon, and I stood outside in the garden and looked for several minutes at the moon, and just enjoyed the view. I liked the chocolates and candy they had provided. The coffee and was a nice touch. The host responded quickly to a question about an early check-in within minutes. Access to the place and ingress to the home was well described and worked easily."

There is a discrepancy in the listed amenities. The description of the space accurately states that there is a kitchenette. However, under kitchen amenities, the kitchen is described as space where guests can cook their own meals. That is not accurate. I'm sure that can be easily corrected on the web site."

Stayed a few nights","Turquoise Skies is one of those places you'd like to keep quiet about, lest it be discovered and not readily available! However, that would not be fair to Barbara or other travelers. I was attending a conference downtown, but craved a quiet retreat for my evenings. I was thrilled to find, within just a few minutes' drive of historic city square, a sanctuary of beauty and a place of peace. I found it to be exactly as described, with one tiny exception. When I booked it months before my visit, the amenities listed on Airbnb included a kitchen, which isn't accurate. The suite does include a well-stocked cabinet with a small fridge/freezer, coffee pot, toaster, microwave, and every little thing you can imagine for keeping things cool and warming things up. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate mix, paper goods, plastic flatware are provided. There is an easy-to-use gas grill in the lovely courtyard. But this little suite is inviting, comfortable, immaculately clean, and charming. Thanks, Barbara!"

It was a little warm in the room at times but we are from an even hotter climate so it wasn’t that uncomfortable. Before we checked out we took a few photos outside the house and one of the hosts came up to us and helped take some photos (which turned out amazing). We felt very welcome and would definitely recommend staying there in the future.

Staying in an adobe home is such a grounding experience, and we loved the charming walled courtyard and gardens. It was a real invitation to move with ease between indoors and outdoors. We look forward to future stays, and highly recommend this lovely home. ✨🙏🏼✨"

The attached unit is tasefully decorated. And clean clean clean. One of the cleanest we have ever stayed in. The flagstone patio is warm and inviting and partially covered.

Liz was extremely responsive (not that we needed anything, everything was already perfect!) but left us alone as well so we felt like we had full privacy.
Make sure to eat at the Tune Up Cafe in the neighborhood, it was a gem.
We loved our weekend in Santa Fe, hiking, food and shops etc..but this air bnb was the best part...truly!! If you're trying to decide whether or not to book it, just do it!!"

The location is fantastic - an easy walk to the rail yard for the farmers and artisans markets, and it was close to great restaurants (listed in her comprehensive area guide). We also walked to the plaza and canyon road, but those are a little farther. We would happily stay at liz’s place next time we’re in Santa Fe!"

The location is exceptional for the price paid since Santa Fe is a high priced area. We were able to get to Santa Fe Plaza in just a five minute drive and to all other areas around the city with ease, especially to our favorite restaurants.
The Casita was decorated in a true New Mexico style, which we enjoyed and the private yard was great for our little yorkie. She loved that yard as much as we did.
We would definitely stay here again."

They also provided paper towels, toilet paper, laundry detergent and coffee and tea. Sometimes AirB&B's can be difficult because you have to go out and buy the essentials or pack it and having everything there for us on this move was amazing and comforting. This place completely surpassed our expectations!
Just for others to know...there is not central air (normal for Santa Fe). We stayed at the end of July during a heat wave and the bedroom was very hot even at night. I think typically it doesn't get that hot so it wouldn't have been an issue and there was a window AC in the living room so that did help with some heat. We would still stay here again in the future and loved it!"

I like it a scotch cooler, so I would love to come back in cooler months. We enjoyed our time in the city of Santa Fe and our time hanging out in this AirBnB. Liz has so many amenities. We were able to cook, enjoy a cup of coffee every morning, and were even able to wash a load of laundry. Everything included is very thoughtful. The whole place was very spacious for us. I had a small Yorkie, and the bowls in the kitchen were a delightful touch and very useful. I hope to return soon!"

Only tip is that we were looking forward to a fire as per the special feature on the listing, and it was chilly out. We didn't realize until it was too late that we were supposed to buy and bring the wood ourselves. Would have been more helpful to put it on the instructions sent before arrival. thanks very much."

Just a word of advice, wood is not provided so make sure you grab some on your way in so you can take advantage of the nice fireplace. Liz was very responsive and helpful. Lastly, I would say that this isn’t one of those crazy AirBnB’s that charge you an exorbitant cleaning fee and then ask you to do the laundry, mop the floors, dust the chandelier :) We hope to stay again next year!"

Liz was very responsive and a great communicator. Her attention to detail was superb. Everything was in the casita, including the washer/dryer and detergent, and plenty of towels. Liz left a bottle of wine we didn't drink, and some fruit and snacks. The location was great, near Sprouts, Whole Food, and Trader Joe's. It was within minutes of many restaurants and just a little over a mile from the Plaza. I agree with other reviews that the parking could be awkward. Arriving there before sunset would help with locating the casita and navigating the parking. The floor heating was a plus during the winter months. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Santa Fe."

We met a wonderful lady and her dog who was staying for a month at an adjoining property of Liz's. Turns out that among other great things about Santa Fe, it is dog friendly, as is Liz's property. If you do bring your dog, definitely check out Frank Ortiz Dog Park, an amazing dog park consisting of 138 acres of arroyos, hills, and trails. It is only 5 minutes by car from Liz's. The property is in a great location - close to not only the dog park, but other areas of interest as well as restaurants and stores. Liz is a fantastic communicator and she really reflects the kindness and friendliness that are characteristics of so many people in Santa Fe."

Great location that was quiet and felt safe. Within walking distance from Tune-Up Café (highly recommend!). Near a number of different grocery store options and points of interest."

The location was perfect for any activity, it was very easy to get to the Plaza and other downtown restaurants, shops and galleries. The Casita was very clean and well supplied for all of our needs. It is very private and relaxing with a nice patio. We would highly recommend the Casita for a stay in Santa Fe and would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Love, love, loved staying here. The home is artfully appointed , from the paint to the rugs, nightstands, craft dining table and chairs…
The kitchen had everything we needed, the bedroom was thoughtfully arranged. Power near the nightstands a plus!
Loved having a fire every night. Sunlight throughout the day thanks to small skylights.
Neighborhood is quiet.
It was easy to see they wanted this to be a home and it felt like it.
Only heads up- the mattress is quite firm which could work great if you’re a back sleeper. The wifi is not robust enough to support remote office work as some are choosing to not go back to an office so you would need a private hotspot."

Although it is technically a guest house, you have full privacy and your own back yard. Loved waking up in the morning with the opened French doors leading to the backyard.
Liz was a wonderful host- super responsive and accommodating. We were even welcomed with our own bottle of wine, which was a great touch after a long car ride. Thank you again and we will be back soon!"

I rented a car in order to drive to a number of hiking trails (there's a wonderful abundance of them!), but I also walked to the downtown area. The quiet studio was a great place to gets some work done and to retreat when I was tired from being out and about.

I texted my friend about an hour after I arrived to say, ""There's a lady who owns the Airbnb I am staying at and I want to be her when I am older."" Next, the location was perfect. I was there a Tuesday through Sunday and I used my car only one time to drive to a trailhead. It is in walking distance to downtown and the Railyard and it is nice to have all of that variety in walking distance to explore. There are amazing restaurants and a grocery close by. The space itself was also really great and importantly, very quiet and peaceful. Totally quiet for sleeping which is rare in my experience. The space has all the basics and I cannot think of anything that I wished it had. I have been going to Santa Fe for 20 years and have stayed in all sorts of accommodations and I truly hope I have the opportunity to stay at Gudrun's place again!"

I had the worse thing happen while travelling this summer; I came down with a bad case of covid. Gudrun jumped into action and provided me with a test kit and then followed up with the local clinic to make sure that I would be seen there. As I was suffering with the symptoms, she never let me feel like she was in fear of the virus or that I was an inconvenience by staying there. She helped me recover with her distant and constant care.
Eventually I was able to travel home on my scheduled dates and thank Gudrun very much for her thoughtfulness and excellent hosting."

Next, not only it is walking distance to the plaza - it is also walking distance to the rail yard district which also has cool restaurants and bars (and where to catch the train to Albuquerque). The airport shuttle from Albuquerque drops off five minutes from Gudrun’s house. Spent four days without a car and didn’t miss it at all!
Finally, Gudrun was incredibly nice! I needed to change my dates slightly to accommodate a flight change and Gudrun was very helpful!
In sun - I worked remotely there, relaxed there, and explored Santa Fe from there - and all was great!"

Stayed over a week",LOVED my stay!! The pictures matched up to the cozy and private atmosphere. Everything you need is provided and stocked. The location is ideal: five minute walk to the rail yard and 15 minute walk to the center of the Plaza. Gudrun is lovely and accommodating. I really can't anything more other than this is an IDEAL stay and I wish I could make it my own secret so that it is available whenever I am in Santa Fe. Don't hesitate to book!

Stayed about a week","Very nice place, nice host. The only consideration is that, as described, the place has a lot of natural light, mostly from long windows near the ceiling on the south wall. There's no covering for these, so if a person requires a lot of darkness in order to sleep, it could be difficult, since the sleeping area is in a loft, nearby to these windows. The location is great for accessing downtown Santa Fe, but this also means that there is a fair amount of ambient light at night. Overall though, it's cozy and functional; I would recommend it, especially (as the host notes) for a single person."

The neighborhood is fantastic -- an easy walk or bike ride to numerous excellent restaurants and coffee shops, the Railyard, and downtown. Gudrun is an absolutely lovely host -- friendly, interesting, a good communicator, and readily available should you need anything. Highly recommended!"

The high rectangular windows bathe the place in mid-afternoon light, and made the loft space feel fully integrated, too. Very, very quiet area, though everything downtown’s within a mile-and-a-half of the stay. (I did drive most places, as SF feels more like a driver’s than a pedestrian’s city. Parking is easy.) Communication with Gudrun was open and full of hospitality. if you’re traveling solo, this is the place."

Stayed about a week","I was fortunate enough to get to spend a week at this relaxing retreat. It was extremely comfortable to the point where I set out later than I intended most mornings, after I brewed my coffee and enjoyed it out at the bistro table in my private, fenced, shaded little flagstone patio area. I slept well up in the sleeping loft, enjoying the cool morning cross breeze coming in the loft window for a few minutes before getting up each day, and the very faint sound of church bells in the distance. The yoga mat in the closet was perfect for doing sun salutations. Most mornings I would set out for a walk then, and I was ecstatic to find that there were so many great restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. I walked to the Plaza 2 or 3 times most days, walked to the delicious French restaurant, and walked to various grocery stores to pick up staples for preparing simple meals back in the studio's kitchen. The dishes, pots and pans, 2-burner cooktop, and refrigerator were everything I needed for cooking and eating in. The studio felt very safe and is in a quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. I found Gudrun, the host, to be very sweet and helpful in giving tips for an amazing Santa Fe experience. Her restaurant recommendations were spot on and very much appreciated. The studio itself was nicely decorated with artwork and southwestern style furnishings, and was such a peaceful and pleasant place to spend time reading and relaxing. I would 100% love to stay here again on return trips, it was such a fantastic and rejuvenating stay."

She met me upon my arrival at her home, and we occasionally chatted during the 14 days I stayed in her lovely studio located next door. I was completely comfortable during the Santa Fe hot spell thanks to a large overhead fan (I never needed the smaller fan adjacent to the loft bed) and the instructions she left about opening up windows in the evening. I lived in Santa Fe many years ago and do visit often, but the reminder was helpful. I didn't rent a car as her place is in walking distance to the best parts of Santa Fe. It's easy enough to rent a car for those day trips or hiking out of the area.

Definitely recommend and would definitely book again for future trips!"

Stayed about a week","Gudrun was a lovely host and was quick to respond to my messages. When I arrived, she gave me great tips on restaurants, museums and public transport in Santa Fe. The studio is located in a quiet neighbourhood with a large supermarket and a few eating places within walking distance, and is about a 15-minute walk from the central plaza area. The apartment was comfortable and is perfect for a single traveller or couple. The bed is located in a loft that is easy to get to using a short ladder, but take note if going up a ladder will be a problem for you. The studio was clean and warm – there were 2 space heaters in the room but one was enough to keep the room comfortable when I visited in winter in February. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at this studio apartment and would stay here again if I made another trip to Santa Fe."

Stayed about a week","I had a wonderful 8 day stay at Gudrun's place. The studio is a separate unit adjacent to the main house which is completely self contained and includes a small private fenced patio area and a private entrance. The studio itself is very distinctive and has a definite Santa Fe feel to it. The sleeping area is a loft that you access via a small ladder - the main floor includes a dining/living area, kitchen, and a large closet. The studio is clean and airy and has a nice feeling to it. I was attending a conference downtown (at the Community Convention Center) and was able to walk there in about 15-20 minutes. Walking to the main tourist areas downtown would probably be the same or slightly less. There is a Whole Foods Market within about 10 minutes of the studio, along with several nice restaurants. Gudrun provided a list of nearby restaurants which was especially helpful upon arrival. I very much enjoyed my stay and would certainly stay here again whenever I return to Santa Fe."

I enjoyed every minute staying at Gudrun's studio, which is beautifully appointed, very comfortable and with a very positive energy. Gudrun is a gracious host with a fascinating background (which explains a lot why the studio and her house too look so effortlessly stylish in a very relaxed way) and her two dogs are sweet bundles of pup love.
Some people mentioned that the road to the house is not very well lit - while that is true, I always felt safe and actually enjoyed the dark nights (coming from the over-lit cities on the East Coast) - so many stars to look at!
It was my first time in Santa Fe - I am sure I'll be back one day and very much hope that Gudrun still rents out the studio..."

Stayed a few nights","Gudrun was a wonderful and accommodating host. Not only did she provide me with resources prior to arriving at her home from the airport, but she even offered to pick me up at a shuttle stop nearby. The studio was perfect for one person and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything I needed. The loft with the ladder gave a nostalgic feel and was reminiscent of my childhood where I would fight over who had the top bunk, but this time, no fighting needed! The high ceiling was also a plus as there was a row of windows placed across the top of the side of one wall that let in the warmth and light during the day and then during the night, while laying on the bed, you can see the moon and some stars. Simply beautiful.
Location was ideal and it was about a good 15 minute walk to downtown and a 5 minute walk to the farmer’s market/Railyard. If you don’t want to do the 15 minute walk, then there’s a free shuttle that will take you throughout downtown (plus Canyon Road and Museum Hill) and the nearest free shuttle stop to the studio is across from the State Capitol building — only a five minute walk from the studio.
Between the free shuttle and public transit, you can practically go anywhere without renting a car. Though, I do suggest Uber/Lyft if you plan to travel at night.
All in all, definitely recommend this studio if you’re looking for quaint, cozy and accessibility."

While I expected a comfortable space, what I didn't expect was the attentiveness of the host. Gudrun was generous in spirit and in action. For example, she volunteered to drive me to the hotel when I was running late for a conference and to the shuttle when I was leaving. The bonus was that she shared her adorable dogs upon request! You can't get that in an over-priced hotel!
While Gudrun was attentive, she was not intrusive in any way, I had as much privacy as I wanted/needed. I really cannot say enough good things about Gudrun and her airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a great time in Santa Fe while staying in Gudrun's studio. The decoration in the studio charming and very consistent with Santa Fe and southwestern colors. I was a little wary of having to climb a ladder to get to the bed, but the climb isn't that bad, and I actually enjoyed being high up and being able to hear the rain on the roof. Gudrun was very attentive and actually drove me to Museum Hill one day when it was pouring rain. Museum Hill turned out to be one of my favorite spots. The studio is about a 10-15 minute walk from downtown. My one caution would be that the street/neighborhood where the studio is located is not well lit at night. If you want to go out after dark, it's probably best to take a Lyft/Uber, which can feel a little ridiculous if you're going a short distance. Though the studio is close to downtown, you will have to cross some rather busy streets to get to downtown. All in all, the studio is a great value, and I enjoyed my time there. I highly recommend it."

Stayed about a week","When the airport shuttle dropped me off in front of Gudrun's adobe home after a ride through picturesque Santa Fe residential neighborhoods, my fellow van riders seemed jealous and I was secretly happy. Gudrun had started communicating with me 2 weeks before my arrival to make sure everything was ready when I arrived and to be able to welcome me. She came right out to greet me, and helped me get settled into the studio.
Throughout my one week stay, I got to walk through the neighborhood, as I made my way to my conference hotel, grocery store, restaurants and pharmacy. All within comfortable and safe walking distance. The Plaza is a little far, but doable on foot. I also noticed buses nearby. Public transportation is something I would have explored if I had stayed longer. I liked that the neighborhood was quiet.
The title of the listing says it: ""cozy"". The place is not big, but you definitely get more than you would staying in a hotel room. It is artfully and professionally outfitted to be welcoming and convenient. The space is so well designed and the attention to detail so great that it takes less than a day to feel right at home. Everything is in its place with an obvious purpose. Being from Switzerland originally, where space comes at a premium but people love their comfort, I noticed that about the place and absolutely loved it.
I would have loved to stay longer and next time I come to Santa Fe, I will check on lodging early and look for Gudrun's cozy studio."

Stayed with a pet","What a magical location. We loved soaking up the birdsong, watching the sunrise over the canyon, enjoying some wine by the outdoor fireplace, and taking leisurely naps on the oh-so-comfy sofa. It was a quick, curvy 18 minute drive into town but felt worlds away. Charles was so gracious in giving us a late checkout when some car trouble put a hiccup in our travel plans. And the gifted libations when we arrived were a real treat. Would love to stay again!"

Stayed one night","Charles place was one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed in. We wanted to experience Santa Fe, but didn't want to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle. His place was just 20 minutes from the town in the mountains. It was a perfect getaway for me, my husband, and my pets. We were only able to stay one night, but wish we could've stayed longer. Place was warm and cozy! Comfortable bed, comfortable couch. Super warm and different ways to heat the casita with propane fireplace inside, outdoors, wall panel heating, etc. Yard was fenced in so dogs were able to go in and out as they please, and they were even able to enjoy the view. When we go to Santa Fe we will book this place again and hopefully have time to cook in the beautiful kitchen. Thank you Charles!"

The home is just as beautiful as pictured - light-filled rooms with comfortable furnishings, artwork, and stylish decor. Everything was spotless and comfortable. The location is phenomenal - just steps outside Santa Fe's stunning mountains.
Charles was very welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed, including recommendations for local spots. The self check-in process was smooth and hassle-free. The Casita itself is thoughtfully equipped with all the essentials and the wifi worked great. The bedroom was quiet and peaceful with beautiful views. The living room was a perfect spot to relax after a day exploring the city.
I would absolutely recommend this Casita especially for those looking to experience all that Santa Fe has to offer. It's a fantastic value in a perfect location with a wonderful host. Ideal for a couple's weekend!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Juliet's was everything we'd expected and more from a few nights in revamped van. the van itself was spacious and very well furnished, with a gas stove, oven, and dishwasher, and the bed was super comfortable and not cramped at all.
Juliet was very kind and welcoming, promptly answered our questions, and left very clear instructions for our check-in and check-out. Overall as kind a host as one could wish for!
If I had to mention a single minor downside to our stay, it would be that the van can get a bit chilly in the winter months (we went in January), but Juliet had it prepped with comfy slippers and a heater by the time we arrived. after cooking a quick dinner on the gas stove and letting the heater and electric blanket do their thing, we went to sleep without issue!
if you don't mind stepping out of your comfort zone just a bit, a stay at Juliet's van is a fantastic lodging option well worth considering! We have it marked as our #1 option for our next Santa Fe trip!"

Stayed one night","Thanks for being a great host Juliet. The van is as exactly as described on the listing. It was a cold night out, but the bedding was more than enough and heater worked a treat in the morning! You are centrally located to DownTown and other local restaurants and grocery stores. I took your word for a coffee and breakfast at “The Tune-Up” which did not disappoint. I spent the day DownTown and at “Meow Wolf” which I highly recommend. I’ll be staying again when I return to Santa Fe."

I will say, if you are over 5’11”, the bed may be a tad bit too short of you sleep fully sprawled. But honestly, it wasn’t a big deal as I slept perfectly fine.
Overall, an amazing stay. I will absolutely be staying here again next time I come through Santa Fe."

The neighborhood was great, Tune Up cafe was my spot for breakfast and dinner and the neighborhood is situated close to down town if you want to check that out.
Apricots were in season when I arrive. Juliet and her husband have a tree and we picked them together. They were absolutely delicious.
Generous, kind and fun hosts. A great, affordable pad. Great proximity to the city and easy commute for bikes. 10/10 would recommend for the solo travelers or couples shorter than 6’4”"

Stayed a few nights","Juliette was a kind and gracious host. She gave us loads of recommendations that were helpful for us to experience great parts of Santa Fe including arts areas, restaurants and hiking suggestions. She was very responsive and generous.
Some reviewed mentioned that you would not need a car but I would recommend renting a car even from this location. You can definitely walk to many parts of Santa Fe from there but a car would give you more flexibility to go farther and do more things.
As for the van, it was fun to sleep so separately and privately but like some others have noted, this is not a luxury experience. You will have to climb up into the bed which will be fine for most people. It was cold when entering the van at first but we did travel in January partially to escape a seemingly endless gray frigid Chicago!
Juliette and her partner are developing the garden area around the van which should look spectacular in the summer!
Overall, we loved our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Juliet’s space was really nice and cozy. The heater she provided for the van was great and was sufficient to keep me warm. My partner runs really cold so we made sure to pack extra blankets in case and sure enough was super useful. Just an FYI if you are staying during cold nights and also tend to get cold easily. Juliet’s separate restroom was clean and a nice-to-have for a van stay. Finally, the location was the greatest perk! We had no issues getting to and from anywhere in the city! She was welcoming and responsive! We appreciated the recommendations in her guidebook 🙂"

Bathroom was lovely, a really nice setup with quality materials and a peaceful environment. Very amicable hosting. It was November and I was very warm and cozy. I hope I can stay here again on another road trip in the future!"

Stayed one night","I had a wonderful time at Juliet's Airbnb. This is the first van I've stayed in, and they did a wonderful job with converting it to a cozy temporary home perfect for a solo traveler. The bed was comfy and the kitchenette was just what I needed. There are plenty of blankets and a space heater to keep you warm at night, and easy access to an indoor bathroom and a relaxing backyard to get some fresh air. Juliet was very responsive, sent me a tour guide of her recommendations, and even let me rent a bicycle from her, which made my Santa Fe experience even more memorable. Shane (sp) was also really helpful in getting me keys, fitting the bicycle, and answering any questions I had while I was there. They're in a great location, and even without a car I was able to get around to where I needed to go. Thanks again for hosting!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a cute spot to stay, I loved getting a look into the van experience and the backyard was beautiful. The bathroom is in the back of the main house and was accessible at all times. The van's outside lights flashed all night and made it a bit hard to sleep, but Juliet was responsive and tried hard to fix the issue (I'm assuming they've fixed it now). Overall I had a decent stay."

Stayed one night","The van accommodated us for one night and it had a small cooking top, a small countertop water dispenser, a mini-fridge, very few dishes and cooking wares. The van is located in the backyard of the house. There was a fireplace and beautiful wooden benches to chill. There was a dry sauna outside and we didn't get a chance to use. The bathroom is in the house and is accessible at all times. Juliet had set up towels, shampoo/conditioner and soap for us to use. Juliet responded back to us within the hour or less and was available when needed. The only one minor thing was the length of the bed which doesn't work for two people with long legs. :-) Other than that, we were happy. Thanks Juliet!"

The home is about a 35 minute pleasant walk to the heart of downtown if you don't want to worry about parking. I definitely recommend this spot for a quiet, relaxing stay. Might be tight for two people, but absolutely amazing for one."
