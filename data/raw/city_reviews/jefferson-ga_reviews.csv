Chris and Sam were so welcoming and friendly, and the guest house was exactly what my family needed as we attended a UGA graduation. From a spacious upper level with comfortable couches, to a clean kitchen, to a relaxing poolside seat with a book and coffee, the guest house is a gem."

They made sure we were comfortable multiple times and made sure we felt safe. They even checked our car for us before we left since they knew we had a long drive ahead of us. 10/10 went above and beyond for their guests and we appreciate it SO much. Thankyou!!

Pool looked great but we were there in the winter so didn't use. Chris (the host) was very friendly and responsive. There is one bedroom downstairs along with the kitchen, living room, and bathroom downstairs. There was another bedroom and living room combined (very large room) upstairs but no bathroom up there. It was quite spacious and we enjoyed being there."

We were able to make a nice breakfast for our family & explore a little while in town for a wedding.
Sam was proactive in communicating with us to make sure we had everything and very flexible with our requests.
Our favorite part was everyone hanging out in the loft at the end of each night & make memories.. what a beautiful space! We so appreciated having such a great place to hang out.
We will definitely be coming back!"

The property is a perfect example of 1/2 mile walk in nature and calm country life (trail through the woods on the property)The neighbors animals are just as welcoming and are probably my favorite part along with pecans falling from the trees. I can’t recommend Chris and her charming property enough."

The surroundings are beautiful to roam around and can have nice walk inside in the farm making you feel close to nature.
Also, there are lots of restaurants within 5-10min drive.
Most importantly ‘Chris’ was super nice and I really thank her for going above and beyond on everything. We will definitely make another visit and anyone who is looking to reserve this place can move forward blindly. Wish I could give 10star rating."

If you’re traveling for business, this is such a peaceful and quiet place to work. Make sure you book enough time to just be on the property and walk on all of the trails.
Pristine pool, well kept, private with a very safe feel. Air conditioners work perfectly
Thank you so much for this serene stay!"

Group trip","OMG, I could write a chapter about the beauty of this place and nurturing owners! Loved having a great pool for our teen grandchildren to swim in! There were plenty of board games to play as well. The pool house is rustic and packed full of windows to view the countryside! We had some sweet bonding time with our hosts too! When a host shows their tender care, it’ll never go wrong. Each morning the pool area was pristinely maintained and the grounds were immaculate! No doubt that we’ll be making our reservations soon for our next Georgia trip! God bless Sam & Chris❤️🙏"

Initially planned as vacation time with family it ended up being the perfect place to come back to at the end of each day as my sisters and I navigated taking care of our mom who unfortunately was in rehab after breaking her hip. Hiking each morning before heading out and relaxing each evening either by the pool or just sitting outside helped tremendously. Chris and Sam are incredible hosts and always checked on us. And if you like cats, Skinny loves to be petted! Thank you Chris & Sam for sharing your space with us."

Stayed a few nights","The house was spotless and the loft area was very spacious. The cost was great, and this was a great home base for us while we visited Athens for my sister's graduation from UGA. The host was friendly, but there wasn't much privacy because the guest house and main house are very close to each other and the living area in the guest house has many windows. When one of the three guests who had planned to visit did not end up coming, the host was kind enough to give us a partial refund, which I really appreciated. Thanks!"

Stayed with kids","This is our all-one favorite Airbnb. We stayed Monday through Friday while our oldest son was at summer camp. We had the time of our lives in quiet Pendergrass. It was a lovely change of pace from what we were used to.
Some of the specifics:
1) Chris and Sam are exceptional hosts. We felt so welcomed by them. They are kind and hospitable. Getting to meet and know them was a highlight of our trip. They’re simply wonderful!
2) It was very spacious, updated, and clean. We had plenty of space inside and outside. We had two adults and three kids, and there was enough space inside to feel comfortable. It was also well stocked with the basics and everything was clearly labeled/easy to find. Outside, the property is located on acres of land, and we had fun going out and exploring the trails and letting the kids play in the vast yard/field. No space is ever perfect, but this one was close to it!
3) We had a blast swimming in the pool. It’s very, very well maintained. Even on the 100 degree day, the pool still felt refreshing. Our kids loved the water slides.
We can’t wait to go back!"

I stayed here because it was close to the wedding venue my brother got married at, and I have an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia knowing I created some forever memories in such a wonderful place.

Oh & not to mention the coffee & tea station was the icing on the cake! We can’t wait to go back & stay again. It feels like home away from home!!"

Stayed with kids","This was our 1st Air B&B experience, so all I have to compare to is home or hotels. The Baxter was beautiful, very clean, uniformity throughout, and felt like a home away from home. We are more of a fragrance free family but we did not tell her because check in was so easy, my oldest daughter did everything for me. Being that we were all girls there are only 2 things I would've changed in this loft - Adding a peep hole and hotel lock. Also, there wasn't a tub for my 2 year old. She had a slip in the glass shower.... but this is not Larissa's fault.
I stayed with my daughters, 14 and 2. We are already looking to book at the Etheridge as we are doing construction on our home in this city.
I would absolutely recommend this beautiful piece of history to everyone!!! It was so comfortable we didn't want to leave. Larissa was extremely helpful and offered a hand if we needed it.
Absolutely wonderful experience. I feel bad for other Air B&Bs we may stay in because this set the bar."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautifully designed apartment! Cozy, modern, tidy, organized. We immediately felt at home and welcome. And once you've looked at the handbook created with a lot of attention to detail (I personally had a lot of data reception in Jefferson and the surrounding area), finding the place is no problem at all!
Incidentally, the WiFi is great.
The kitchen is incredibly well equipped! Bed was soooooo cozy. And there was pillow spray - I love such details.
Everything is just beautiful and designed with love.
The only thing to note is that it is not very quiet. It is a beautiful historic building with appropriate windows and the traffic is what it is. My husband was too much too much even with the windows closed. Personally, I even slept well with a slightly open window (with the help of the earplugs provided)."

We had a wonderful time staying in and watching tv and then walking through the town during their Christmas event. The Diesel Coffee Shop, Friends restaurant, and small shops nearby were amazing & gave us something to do that wasn’t time consuming!
We highly recommend this amazing apartment that’s tucked above a cute town!"

Her place is very walkable (1-2 minute walk) to a nearby brewery (Revival Hall) and a very delicious donut spot (Diesel Donuts and Coffee). It's also 20 minutes away from Chateau Elan which was perfect for us. Her place was very clean and had all of the amenities we needed for our weekend staycation. It felt like we were staying in a luxury apartment. I would highly recommend this place to everyone!

Larissa did a fabulous job at posting an accurate description of what to expect with the parking, unit being upstairs, appliances, check-in and out process, and the place itself. She gave great recommendations on places to check out in this fun, small town! Definitely recommend and plan to stay again. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Nice stay in Hoschton. At first, the location felt off backing up to a parking lot but it is very convenient only 1 block from the local coffee shop and other eateries and the other side of the street feels quaint with nice homes. The stay was clean and tidy but there are wall/roof stains from water leakage etc. along with other cosmetic idiosyncrasies. Overall the place was charming and it didn't take long to feel cozy. The ceiling clearances, along with having a small couch, can lead to the place feeling tight, especially for a taller/bigger person so something to note however, for a short stay, I felt it suited my needs and offered a nice comfortable and convenient space in this area of GA."

Stayed with kids","cute, clean, small air bnb. house is older and needs some repairs to the walls and floors but nothing that would greatly impede your stay. things that might help improve the air bnb would be dishwasher, washer& dryer, curtains, list of local eatery and to do's. really easy to check in and out. hard to find the right temperature inside - manually operate window units for AC and furnace for heat we felt like it was either too hot or too cold but that could just be us. overall a great stay for the value/price and we would stay again."

The rocking chairs on the porch paired nicely with our morning coffee. We look forward to staying again next year when we come back for Formula Drift at Road Atlanta.

The bed in one of the bedrooms was a blow up mattress though. My co-worker said it was fine, as blow-up beds go. But was unexpected when we noticed that it was not a regular bed & mattress. I also hadn't noted that the essentials are not included (it is correct in the listing though). So if you don't bring these with you then you'll need to make a run to the grocery store (10 minutes down the road)."

I hope I can stay longer next time to take advantage of the lake and walking trail that surrounds the area. I am a frequent Airbnb traveler, and I must say that Cynthia's place was just perfect. The basement was well stocked and had everything we needed for our short stay. If you are ever in the area, do yourself a favor and book now!

She had a mini fridge with water, soda and half and half, with a selection of coffee and tea, as well as some packages of microwave popcorn, which Henry Tater(my dog) and I both enjoyed! She also had dog treats for Henry Tater, which he scarfed down! The enclosed backyard was perfect for Henry Tater to get his energy out first thing in the morning and I didn’t have to worry about what he might be up to. My bed was very comfortable and the whole place was spotlessly clean. I was also thankful that there were some samples of toiletries, since I forgot my shower cap, but she had a brand new one available! There was a machine for coffee,microwave and hot plate, with dishes and pans in case I needed to warm something up or cook.
Oh! And the projection tv was awesome!!
I would love to stay there again!

Stayed a few nights","Reasonably-priced stay at this guest house/ AirBnB. We checked in late Friday night with no issues (look for the white fence, as we passed it a few times). The duplex guest house is located behind the large, white main house. The room looked just like the pictures and the studio-like apartment was well stocked.
It was in close proximity to a wedding we were attending and to downtown for food. We, unfortunately, didn’t get to enjoy the patio area because my partner is allergic to fur babies (the cat was hilariously comfortable), but I would still recommend this place."

So this was an emergency trip and wen needed a place to stay. Of course we could of chosen any hotel, but instead are so much happier we chose this little slice of home. It was very convenient , it felt like home, and was just exactly what we needed. There was even a storm while we were there and we lost power for a bit, and Darlene came out in the rain to bring us a lantern to see with. All the special touches were there when we arrived, to include a hand written note and chocolates! Just what this girl needed during this very difficult time! Darlene, thank you for all the extra special touches! I absolutely do recommend your places and would visit again."

Stayed with a pet","John and Rebecca’s home was the perfect Airbnb experience. They have a beautiful home in the perfect location with all the right amenities. They were friendly, welcoming, and informative. I enjoyed our conversations, the atmosphere provided was exceptional.
I was staying for nearby business but on the last night I finally went to hang out in the hot tub and watched the sunset on their farm (it was really the perfect way for someone to relax that never relaxes, lol). There are lots of other things on the farm I didn’t get to like the blueberry patch, farm animals, and the pool. I’m looking forward to visiting again with family and will be sure to take time off from work so I can enjoy all these amazing hosts have to offer.
10/10. Thank you John and Rebecca!"

Everything we wanted or needed was already there. This was my favorite stay by far. The farm animals were all so sweet and cute. The hot tub, fire pit, swing, great walks, nice seating areas, cozy indoor spots, hosts and outdoor beauty truly make this a 5 star Air BnB."

Great pool and indoor outdoor common space…swimming, also hot tub, it’s great sitting out there in the evenings by the firepit, listening to the forest sounds. I’d really like to bring my wife back there with me to enjoy it."

Stayed a few nights","I understand the 5 star reviews - John and Rebecca are nice people & John goes out of his way to be available for questions. But if someone had posted an honest review, I would never have made reservations at Corriedale Farm - pictures shown on their page are very outdated/inaccurate and not at all what I saw. I cannot speak for the separate guest house (which was immaculate on the outside), but the farmhouse was not clean. The shared kitchen was rife with gnats including dead ones all over the window sill, no towels/paper towels to clean/dry dishes with (I had to go into their pantry for them), dirty counters. Not anywhere I would cook. The bedrooms downstairs, well, let’s just say the cleaning person changed the sheets but not mattress cover, bedspread or covered bed pillows (yuck). I’m not even sure she changed the sheets as I went to remove the bed cover, only to have a drinks coaster pop up, caught somewhere in the bedspread! I had flies and gnats in my room, a cockroach outside my door in the morning and ants! The bathroom had visible long dark hairs stuck to a shelf, worn towels and a shower that backed up 2” within minutes (gross). The bathrooms were not clean.
The walkout from my room that I was looking forward to relaxing on was massively overgrown by weeds, with dirty chairs made worse by a clean or dirty threadbare bath rug hanging over one. There were large pieces of furniture glass dumped all over the property for some reason. The fire pit area, completely misrepresented on their site, had broken chairs, wheelbarrows filled with mosquito infested stagnant water (which I tipped/drained), BROKEN GLASS (I had my dog with me!) and weeds upon weeds! I actually weeded the area, removed hazardous pieces of metal, curled up the hose, and cleaned up the grill tools laying all over the ground just so I could relax there.
I left a day early for a family issue, but truthfully, I could have stayed the last night of my reservation. I was just so uncomfortable there. I’m not squeamish, but when you pay $80 a night to stay somewhere it should be clean. Period. For John to say he doesn’t believe in needing to be “Covid clean” okay, I can get that -- but this house needed a good scrubbing from top to bottom, outside and inside.
I could have had a similar farm/dog-friendly experience at other places that were much closer to home but I was duped by outdated pictures and spent money I don’t really have (celebrating the end of months of cancer treatment) at Corriedale Farm. I wanted to celebrate surviving cancer in a clean, beautiful place and instead was uncomfortable, unsettled, and ultimately unhappy. Even thinking about it now makes me so upset. My first vacation in a year should have been better, needed to be better, but now the vacation is over, the money's gone and the tranquil rest I so desperately needed didn’t happen.
Did I say anything to my hosts? No, but despite confirming twice that I was arriving at 3 pm (normal check-in time), the cleaning person (Pattie) had not yet arrived and I was left to sit outside for more than an hour while she “cleaned.” John himself spoke to his lax ideas about cleaning night one, so I didn’t feel bringing it up would help. And let’s face it...it’s difficult because this is their home and you have a room in it (versus say a guest house). I would have been commenting on their cleanliness and I didn’t feel comfortable doing that. I should have, but I don’t think it would have changed anything.
Nice people but clearly they need help maintaining the rental rooms and shared spaces. I am sorry I stayed there, as I’m sure they will be when they read this review."

My dog had a great time playing and sniffing goats. She’s a city chick. :p

John and Rebecca were extremely friendly, helpful and eager to provide everything our visit required. We found all the positive reviews about the farm to be very accurate, honest and well-deserving. We won't hesitate to stay here again when we're in the area (if it's even available) and that says it all. John and Rebecca have great plans to make this mini-farm even better. If you have kids, this is a great place to get them involved in the outdoors and away from their electronic devices (also good for us adults, sometimes!!)."

Stayed one night","My wife and I had the pleasure of spending one night at the amazing Tuscan Farm that John and Rebecca have so graciously opened to travelers. We made the decision to request a same-day booking and John was very prompt in getting back to us and confirming our reservation. The communications were excellent and very helpful to us since we were driving all day. The access from I85 is easy.
John and Rebecca were very generous and took time to share the story of the farm and let us get to know them better. We had great fun meeting the animals and touring the grounds. I really appreciated that they have created a real working farm from which they harvest fresh produce and milk, eggs, etc. In fact, the wonderful breakfast that Rebecca prepared for us was made with fresh ingredients from the farm. It was delicious and beautifully presented. John even built a fire in the patio fire pit to take the chill off as we sat outside to eat our dinner and enjoy the early fall night air just after sunset.
With all the talk of the ""farm"", I thought it important to point out that even though the setting is rural, the house and accommodations are totally modern and world class. The house is open and airy with beautiful decorations. The wi-fi worked perfectly for our needs.
This is the kind of experience that keeps us excited about using Airbnb on our travels and we will certainly be back visiting John and Rebecca next time we are passing through North Georgia."

Stayed one night","What a wonderfully unique stay! We had the best luck of happening upon this fabulous Tuscan farmhouse only a short drive to Athens. Even though we gave the gracious host and hostess, John and Rebecca, only a 1 hour notice very late in the day, they were so generous to say yes to us (even though they had just arrived home themselves from a long trip.) We were welcomed at the driveway by John who showed us where to park our 16 foot trailer we were towing, and then shown around his beautiful home that he has transformed from an abandoned house into a lovely Tuscan farmhouse. John and Rebecca were the friendliest and most gracious host and hostess we have ever seen. We truly have new friends in life now. Rebecca cooked a homemade from scratch full breakfast, complete with homemade biscuits, homemade jam, sausage, blackberry streusel, fresh eggs from their farm, and pretty little home grown cherry tomatoes. We wish we could have stayed 2 nights so we could have enjoyed the pool and taken a tour of all the farm animals. We definitely will call upon our new friends John and Rebecca in the future if we are in the Athens area again! Thank you again for taking in 2 weary travelers and treating us as family!"

The home has a European inspired decoration that I absolutely adored, and then further out on the property we greeted the precious sheep and other farm animals each morning. Their peaceful property was just a short drive from a vineyard we visited as a nice day excursion, and also not far from downtown Athens. John was very easy to communicate with and always incredibly accommodating. We even had to check in quite late, but they were both still awake to welcome us and give us a tour. P.S. Rebecca's breakfast cooked with ingredients from the farm deserves its own review in itself. Delicious!!! We can't wait to have an excuse to come back."

Joseph went above and beyond to have a grill put in for us to cook some steaks on. The home was clean and had all of the ammenities we needed to relax in the evenings after work. Even enjoyed the fire pit and star gazing. The beds were comfortable, everything was clean, and there wasn't a lot of clutter to straighten up before leaving. Will likley be back a few more times."

Stayed with kids","This house was great for our two families to stay at. We wanted something close to Lake Lanier Islands but not too far from other places like Helen or Toccoa Falls. It was only a 30 minute drive to the lake, 1 hour drive to Helen/Toccoa Falls, and 45 minutes to Atlanta. We loved the fact that it had a gate to enter the property! The house was very spacious and exactly as pictured. They even left us little treats :) There are a few things I would recommend bringing if you're like us and like to cook dinner at least one night during vacation. We had plenty of pots/pans but found ourselves needing a serving/soup spoon, baking pan, non-breakable cups for kids, a lighter/wood (for the fire pit outside), cast iron skillet (there is no grill), and wash cloths (only towels and hand towels are provided). Other than those items, the house had everything else you would need. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely stay here again! Joseph was a great host and very responsive."

Immaculately decorated, impeccably clean, and wonderful outside porch overlooking the pond.
When we arrived we found our host had prepared the home with so many amenities!
There is tremendous space in every room. The closets are very large.
The peace and tranquility was the best. I watched the beautiful sunrise from the wrap around porch overlooking the pond.
We will definitely stay here again as this was by far the most thoughtful and prepared host.
I cannot express enough the beauty of this home and the kindness of our host."

Stayed with kids","Spencer and Amy were very nice and we appreciated them letting us check in early. We also had a chance to meet the tenant Kevin and he was a very nice, polite man. The cabin was tucked back on the families property and it looked just like the photos. Very peaceful location, but not too far away from things to do. We stayed here for my son’s second birthday to take him into Atlanta to go see some attractions. We really enjoyed the cabin, but there did seem to be an excessive amount of stinkbugs inside. Not sure if it’s the season since we aren’t from GA, but we killed a handful of them each night we stayed. My son is a bit spooked of flying bugs so hopefully we didn’t bother Kevin too much with the crying. Aside from that, it was a wonderful stay and we had some great memories for his second birthday."

What made it even better was its pet-friendly policy, allowing us to bring our dog for the weekend and enjoy morning walks along the nearby trail - which our dog absolutely adored! The cabin was fully equipped with everything one could need. We invited my mom and brother to drive down from Indiana, enabling us to cherish quality family moments around the bonfire. Conveniently located about an hour from Helen and the surrounding area, 40 minutes from Athens, and an hour from Atlanta- making it a truly picturesque and accessible destination for whatever vibe you are looking for. It was the perfect fall weekend escape."

Stayed a few nights","I've used AirBnB many times for business, this was my most enjoyable stay. I appreciated the beauty of the rustic cabin. I spent my mornings drinking coffee on the front porch watching doe & fawn, rabbit and squirrels jumping from tree to tree, hummingbirds would also visit. The bed linen was clean, as was every part of the cabin. I like a very firm bed, their beds were softer but wasn't a problem for my back. I probably used only 10% of the amenities offered, seems like they tried to cover everything (even a grill and fire pit). There is a Grounds Keeper living below, but I neither heard nor saw him/her. I was more concerned about disturbing them, the floor does squeak and creak (eventually you resign it to being part of the cabin charm). Internet and TV was fine, but preferred looking at the cabin design and wall art. I was in the area for a wedding. Most stayed at a national chain Inn. I paid half as much, and feel the cabin was four times more pleasant. I would return again."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here during a Thanksgiving road trip and went to BabyLand General Hospital the next morning. It was our 2 year old daughter's first road trip. We had a little bit of a late check-in but had no problems with finding it. We enjoyed our stay and would return if in the area again. I appreciated the cabinets being labeled to make it easier to find things in the kitchen. Everything was clean and as pictured. There is a bedroom and bathroom downstairs and a bedroom and loft upstairs. In the future, we would set up our daughter's room upstairs. The bathroom light shines into the bedroom downstairs so I had to shower in the dark so as to not wake her up. I tried to be quiet when going downstairs and to the bathroom at night also."

Having toiletries, pantry items, etc. was a blessing. Such thoughtful extras like the welcome board and freeze pops for our little ones made it even better! Thank you for opening up your home, and we’ll be back in the fall to celebrate our anniversary…without the kiddos! 😅"

Everyone was quick to respond when I had questions and very helpful in providing suggestions on nearby restaurants. Plus the area offers so much to do within a half hours drive!

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at the cabin in the woods for 3 nights visiting family close by. We loved the the cozy set up and found plenty of space for our party of 4. There was even an extra bed in the loft had we planned for more. The amenities were thoughtful and plentiful, we couldn't have asked for anything else. Spencer and Amy were very responsive and flexible with our ever changing schedule as we converted our driving plans to a flying itinerary at the last minute. This would be a great spot for anyone trying to get a break from the city or those like us that are visiting family/friends in the area. There is a great little nature hike on the property and your dog is welcome as well, I even spotted some dog treats in the cabinet! Thanks for a great vacation!!"

The only warning might be that if you drive a sports car or other car without much ground clearance, the driveway to the apartment could be a bit tricky, but the alternative should be viable. The apartment itself though was great."

We were surrounded by meadow and blooming trees. Micheal and Lydia were warm and friendly, left helpful hints to make our stay comfortable, and were quick to respond to questions. The separate apartment gave us privacy. The furnishings were comfortable, very clean, and made us feel at home.
Since we had such a good time (and our children, too, visiting the animals) and because the farm is so close to Jefferson where the kids are, we will be staying with Michael again on our next trip to Georgia."

Stayed about a week","What a delightful time we had! The location worked perfect for us and we really liked the privacy. Michael was very conscientious and helpful. We even enjoyed visiting with the donkey and goat ""neighbors""! We will try to stay again next time we're in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Place was clean and plenty of space. Proximity to Road Atlanta racing circuit was very helpful. There's a coffee maker but not coffee, but other than that everything was more than enough."
