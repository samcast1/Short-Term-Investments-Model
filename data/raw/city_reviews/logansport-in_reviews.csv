Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Eel River House for 3 nights. From the moment we contacted Malan, we were greeted by his warmth and hospitality. The house was immaculately clean and orderly. Much detail was given such as candies by the bed, local coffee, and all of the necessary essentials in the kitchen. The garden is well cared for and beautiful. We enjoyed good company while sitting on the porch and watching the sunset. Definitely looking forward to our next stay at the Eel River House! Thank you, Malan, for making our eclipse trip extra special."

Stayed about a week","This is a wonderful home with a gracious host. The home is spotless, well-stocked and maintained. Malan met us at check-in and was a responsive and clear communicator. The location along the Eel River was all the better with the number of birds we saw during an early migration in March. Wi-fi was 'good to go' with no issues. Highly recommend this home and host to anyone needing an abode in this area!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a comfy cosy home away from home, this is the place. From the moment Malan met us at the door and welcomed us with a friendly grin, we knew we made a good choice. Exceptionally clean with anything you could need. Such a homey atmosphere really took me back to a simpler time. The grounds are beautifully decorated with all manner of gorgeous flowers. Very nice garden and we partook of some of the produce at the invitation of our gracious host. We will most definitely be back and hopefully for a longer stay. Thank you so much Malan, Charles and Jack"

Stayed a few nights","A queit peaceful place to stay not too far off the beaten path. We enjoyed staying at Eel River House while visiting nearby family for fall break. Everything one would need for weekend or week away is all here.
In addition to seeing family we managed time to go to McClure's orchard for apples, pumpkins, the corn maze and petting zoo, to go for a long walk on the Nickle Plate trail, and to take our nephew to Miami's fort children's park in Peru.
The kitchen appeared set up for cooking but we choose to eat out at all our favorite places. We had coffee and doughnuts from Aromas, pizza from Harvey Hinklemeyers, and drove over to Akron one night to Dilly's.
I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a beautiful country setting not far from town."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Malan's house. It was very comfortable and relaxing. The furnishings and decorations were nostalgic. They brought back memories of my grandparents' house.
The location of the house is ideal. It is minutes away from downtown Peru, but it is on a quiet street in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch listening to the birds.
Malan is a great host. He met us at check-in and toured us through the house. One day, he was working in his vegetable garden and we visited with him for a bit. We shared some stories and he shared some of the vegetables with us. Malan was very available to us, but was not intrusive.
When we travel to the area again, we will try to stay here."

This was our oasis at the end of each day. It is spotless, but with so many treasurers inside - Malan must dust every day! The bed is super comfy, the towels are so soft I want to know where to buy them. Malan met us and gave us a tour, and now we have a new friend. We Airbnb alot, and this place was a highlight for us. There are too may lovely things to list. If you like peace and quiet, but close to town, this is your spot ."

Stayed a few nights","This house is in a really nice area, very peaceful and quiet. It sits just outside of the town of Mexico, Indiana, with the Eel river across the street, so it's really not too far out in the country. It is very convenient to get to several different places in the area from Malan's house. The house is very clean and there's plenty of room to spread out if needed. I loved the big circular driveway, since I had a larger truck for doing some hauling work while I was there. I would definitely stay again if it is available when I come back to town."

We spent our evenings playing Christmas music or the record player. Our visit was in the late fall so it was cold, but I can imagine how fun it would be in the summer with the river right there. The host was friendly and was there for anything we needed. I would highly recommend this place while visiting family or for a quiet get away!"

The owner was nice, and had the home all warmed up for us when we got there. It's always nice to have a washer and dryer available to use. It's a nice place, but definitely not kid friendly. Next time we visit family there, we'll probably check to see if it's available. 🙂"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay in Logansport! It is such a beautiful place! Thank you for allowing us to stay with an extra guest. The extra blankets really helped!
We only have a couple of minor suggestions. The first is about the showerhead. I know that my children and I are taller than the average person so maybe it isn't a big deal to most guests ¯\_(シ)_/¯ so we had to do acrobatics to get under the showerhead. (ᴗ•ᴥ•) I know it isn't feasible to redo the plumbing for just the showerhead but maybe just replace it with one that you can also detach and use as a handheld? (That is what we did in our showers at home)
The other little suggestion is maybe some extra hangers in the closet? We like to hang up most of our clothes so we went to Wal-Mart and bought some for our stay. (I intended to leave them for the next guest but Mike didn't know and packed them up)
Thank you again for everything!

The house was immaculately clean with a well equipped kitchen. The wifi was good. Malan, our host, was friendly and helpful and gave us privacy. After we left, we realized that our daughter had left her phone somewhere in the house. Malan searched until he found it in the couch cushions, and he set up a time to meet my mother-in-law to pick it up. I'd call that going above and beyond!!! Next time we are in the area we plan to stay at the Riverhouse."

If you are a birder the property does not disappoint with hummingbirds, bluebirds and house finches really close and active off the comfy front porch. The area was quiet and calm with sufficient parking for both my and my friend's cars. Worth the stay and I would stay again."

Stayed a few nights",this fabulous little cottage is indeed very eclectic and totally retro! Even the appliances reminded me of a step back in time to Mom/Grandmas place. Now sometimesfolks use the word retro but it really means tired. This was not the case! even though everything in the house from the furniture to the appliances to the wall hangings was a step back in time everything was in pristine condition. we enjoyed the porch overlooking the wonderful yard across from the river very much. We plan to book again when we are in the area:-)

Misty and Mark were most accommodating and the studio guest quarters were extremely comfortable. They have upgraded the seating from the gray couch to Lazy-Boy love seat recliners! Likely the cleanest Air B&B we have experienced. No steps and the curb less shower is much appreciated for us seniors. It was a little challenging finding the correct drive but there address number is on the mailbox and when you look for the white finish it is very obvious.

Stayed a few nights","Spacious, pristine, simple, charming, and everything we needed for our getaway from it all stay! Misty replied to any questions almost immediately! Mattress was softer than we were used to, so we were surprised at how comfortable it actually was - and the bedding was so cozy! The pond and woods trails provided an entertaining variety of nature for curious nature buffs like me. A beautiful, serene place. I plan to bring my daughter and her girls here soon! Tip: the bathroom is done in an industrial theme. It has a concrete floor that gets slippery when wet. There are a couple of bath mats on the floor and nice-sized non-skid mats in the shower. Those with falling or balance issues might want to bring flip-flops or shower shoes for extra precaution. We usually camp in our camper when we travel but love this place so much, we'll likely make this an annual (at least) to come visit."

Stayed with a pet","Just came back from spending 3 nights there with my pup. It was one of my fav airbnbs so far. The place was super easy to find and I was impressed by how clean and simple everything was. I’m super picky about how clean a place feels when you first walk in and I had absolutely no issues, not a cob web in sight, and I didn’t feel like I had to keep all my bags off the floor lol. The mini kitchen was just enough for me to prepare the food I packed and the shower in the bathroom is amazing. I specifically was looking for a place that was lowkey, quiet, AND had access to a pond for fishing and this was perfect. I even caught my first 5 pound bass! The hosts were super welcoming and accommodating especially when it came to having my dog with me. I already told them I plan to come back."

Parking is right in front and private behind their home. It offers basic amenities (coffee but no cream or sugar sorta deal) and is safe and quiet in the country. They have large dogs on the property which didn't bother me at all, but if you don't like big dogs be forewarned. I recommend this space in rural Indiana."

We were able to comfortably work from the place the next day and the kitchenette made dinner and breakfast easy.

Stayed a few nights","My mom and I stayed here on the weekend for a family reunion on Sunday. Saturday night we were just about to sleep when a very noisy party started in the restaurant/bar below us. The music was so loud it shook the floor and walls. It went until 3am. I was told there isn’t a noise ordinance in the downtown area. So note that when planning your trip (I think ‘the possibility of a party’ has been added to the description now). Seems the bar is open until 3am on Saturday into Sunday.
The space was the right size for us. I missed having a nightstand in the smaller bedroom to put my glasses and phone on. The street/car noise wasn’t bad. The ceiling fan wasn’t working in the living room, but Princessa had a box fan delivered to help there. There wasn’t a toaster (I missed that one wasn’t listed on the amenities), but when I asked about one she ended up leaving one for us. I won’t stay at this location on the weekend again, but I would during the week."

Jeanettes parents were a big part of the Peru community. Her father was even mayor. There's so much great Peru memorabilia in this house. It's like a tastefully curated museum. The house was spotless, really nice modern bathroom. So clever how the kitchen is modern, but all of the classic things like the ironing board closet are still there, very cool, you just don't see that anymore. VERY quiet at night. Short walk to downtown. Jeanette was just the best host.
Can't say enough. I definitely will stay there again."

5 blocks from South Trail. 2 miles (easily done by bike) to the North Trail
3) Comfortable beds... We only used one bedroom, but our bed was fine.
We had great interaction with Jeanette and her manager Mona. Both were very cordial, and helped whenever needed.
We loved staying at this very quaint, very historical home. Loved all the paintings, and little persanal touches. We will definetly stay again if we go to Peru."

Stayed with kids","Janet was a sweet hostess. Her cabins are beautiful. Very cozy and just enough space for two. The decor is adorable. My grandson and I stayed two nights and enjoyed the horses and donkey, walking out into the open fresh air and building a fire at night. He kept saying, “Lita, we need to come back!”🥰🥰 Thank you, Janet!"

Super cute, and only 7 minutes from the site. My cabin was clean, comfy, and relaxing—and a much better vibe than the hotel rooms I would have had to drive to Kokomo for. I will absolutely be booking again next time I'm attending an event in the area."

Stayed one night","Janet was an amazing host. She greets you when you arrive and makes you feel welcomed. She goes out of her way and provides extras like sodas, candy, coffee, and popcorn, etc. available for your use. Janet is the hostess with the mostest! She is very kind and compassionate She gives you privacy as well. The cabin was great!!! It was very comfortable. It is a great getaway. It is close to wonderful local restaurants. It is next to the Grissom Air Force Museum which was fantastic. My son and I enjoyed great father and son time. The cabin comfortably sleeps two people. But there are three other rentals onsite if you are traveling with other couples. It is a beautiful place at a reasonable price. We also enjoyed the donkey and horses onsite. She has available kayaks, corn hole, hot tub and sauna. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch swing and rocking chairs. I would highly recommend Janet's. place if you need a peaceful retreat from the busy hustle of every day life. We plan to return."

On her own time she went out of her way to get my son and I a couple of kayaks for my son and I to use at no additional cost even though we offered. She has lived there her whole life and went out of her way to make us feel at home. The fridge was stocked with a variety of name brand soda pop and the bathroom was even full of toiletries. There were plenty of towels and wash rags available as well. I highly recommend this listing.

The soaking tub in the bathroom was a bonus. Our dog Molly enjoyed the fended in backyard. The kitchen was spacious and had everything we needed. We couldn't have asked for a better week ad truly felt like we were at a home away from home. Rebecca the host was an excellent communicator and made us feel welcome. We will absolutely stay here again next year when my husband comes back to Indiana to hunt. Fantastic stay. You won't be disappointed!

There was a sulfur smell due to well water I believe; recommend bringing bottled water if you prefer. We were visiting family, so we didn’t use all the amenities offered. The porch, grill area, and fenced in yard looked awesome. Easy and seamless check-out instructions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"

Beautiful plantings and a fenced yard made it perfect. We’ll be back. Mike and Betty

We traveled with our 10 month old baby and when I asked if she had a pack and play to rent she went and bought one and had it waiting for us when we arrived. The first night we noticed the primary bedroom door was very squeaky. When we notified Rebecca she dropped off a can of wd40 per our request that same day. Voila, no more squeaking! Rebecca was always quick to respond to any questions we had a well as being understanding of us having family over as we were visiting my home town to introduce our little one to my family. The house was clean, spacious and well decorated. The mattresses were very comfy. The grounds were beautiful! My husband enjoyed fishing in the Wabash River right off the back yard! It was a perfect location and setting for our visit."

Stayed a few nights","This house is adorable, comfortable and well stocked. We spent Easter weekend here to celebrate with our son who attends Purdue. It had everything we needed and then some to enjoy Easter dinner, cozy places to watch movies, and also spend some quiet time overlooking the river.
The back porch and large windows were perfect for appreciating the river view. The house appeared to be recently renovated and everything was beautiful. Our host was very accommodating and friendly. The only negative I have is the proximity to the railroad tracks. I should have realized that being located close to where the tracks cross the road, the train whistles would be blowing. That was a bit loud, especially at night. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider some earplugs, but I wouldn't let it stop me from enjoying this gem on the river."

We came out here from Philly for work down In kokomo and weren't sure really what to expect out here. None of us have ever been out to the mid west. We couldn't have been happier with the way we were treated. Deb definitely was the star of the show for us as well as the people we've met in Logansport as well at the different places we stopped into. All in all a very pleasant stay when we found ourselves not having to work. Thanks for making us feel at home Deb even when we were far from it.

Stayed a few nights","Deborah was a fabulous host. She is incredibly kind and very responsive. She was amazing at getting me in immediately even with a last minute request after my previous plans fell through. She made check-in and check-out so easy. The location is perfect. The cottage is in a peaceful, rural setting with the river across the large back yard, but you're in to shopping and dining within a couple of minutes, and there are plenty of delivery options available (if, like me, you're too exhausted from travel to cook). The best part was the warblers who would visit at the windows in the afternoon to check out what was going on. The only negative was some inconsistent water pressure, but there were also Twix (and other little treats) available, and I always believe chocolate can make up for just about anything."

One must be able to climb a few stairs as there are a few steps into the kitchen and bathroom level of the home. If you get a chance to meet Deb, she is one of the sweetest and nicest ladies!

From the moment I rented it I knew it was going to be special because the Host Deborah was so warm, charming, and simply a blessing. She went out of her way to make sure our WYFI and television was up and running for my daughters special weekend. From the moment we walked in the door we both feel in love with the cottage. It has every accommodation anyone could want and is so beautiful. We had an amazing time! I’ve already discussed with Deborah renting it again soon! Not only did I find an amazing weekend getaway but I found an amazing new friend in Deborah…."

The apartment is immaculate. The furnishings, the linens, the kitchenware - everything is exquisite. It was sparkling clean upon my arrival. I felt like i was staying in a home featured in a magazine!
It wasn't at all an issue for me - but do note that there are many steps to get up to the apartment.
Communication with Stacy & the co-hosts was wonderful. Super fast & responsive. Check in & check out was super easy. Had an issue with the internet and got an instant response and it was fixed pretty much immediately.
Location is great if you are visiting Delphi. Just a couple blocks to the shops/restaurants downtown. Even though the house is in town - its super quiet.
Highly recommend this apartment if you are visiting Delphi. I will 100 percent stay again"

Although there seemed to be a bit of miscommunication between the other cohosts about the parking situation. WiFi was a bit slow to do anything besides streaming Netflix but that's all we used it for so it was fine. The town itself is very small and there isn't much to do there, although there is a small little park over the river which was a nice walk. Overall experience was good but Stacy wasn't very responsive. Also, something to note. There are neighbors that live next door. When they walk by they can see you through the window if you are sitting in the living room couch as well as if you're in the kitchen."

What a great find for a travel nurse to come back to after a long shift. You need not bring anything the apartment has everything you could possibly need for your stay and is super cozy. Will definitely stay again the next time I am in Delphi or Lafayette."

Group trip","The cabin and the property exceeded all my expectations. The setting was magical: foxes, deer, beavers, fish, all kinds of birds, baby geese, and rabbits were everywhere. The cabin has both a luxurious vibe and a rustic charm. Beds were extra comfortable, plenty of fluffy towels, and more than everything you could possibly need for a relaxing vacation. Really appreciated Lisa's attention to details, like the French Press coffee maker, excellent pots and pans, and fully stocked bathrooms. Also appreciated Lisa's recommendation of Kun's bakery in Logansport, the cinnamon rolls were over the top."

Everything was great though and Lisa was a great host. The only thing I had a problem with (and this was completely My FAULT for not reading the listing thoroughly) is it’s only two bedrooms the bunk beds are open in a loft area and we were 4 coworkers who enjoy our privacy. Great for families with kids though. Once again my fault for not reading the obvious description. I hope to bring my family here during the summer!

The host was kind to provide a generous bowl of snacks in the kitchen and was always available via the app, when we had questions.
The place is stand alone house, so there was no one above or below us, which is perfect. If you're looking for a romantic getaway for two, this is definitely the spot!

I was looking forward specifically to enjoying the hot tub. However, I discovered that the hot tub was in an indoor room on the lower level of the house next door. I expected it to be outside and close to the cabin. So I decided not to use it. But the rest of the experience made up for the disappointment."

Know one was there to meet me, but I used my common sense and looked at the pictures, realized I was at the right place, and just went inside to help myself. Thankful I did. Janet had a prior arrangement that she forgot about. So she was unable to meet, and she apologized. And she is so friendly and nice. And so are her daughters. She had great recommendations, and I will definitely stay there again.
The sauna and hot tub is super nice. It's in the bottom level of the house, the door to the right.
Thank you ladies."

Stayed one night","Can't begin to express how unhappy I was with this attempted reservation.
I chose the property as it looked to have potential, paid, then waited.
And waited and waited. I reached out to host via text, phone and AirBNB messaging. No responses. I assumed I would get one, and continued my drive in the direction of the AirBnb. 30 mintues past, than an hour, then more hours. No contact from host. No directions or instructions on how to stay.
Arrived in the general area still without contact. Stress level rose. Contacted Airbnb. They tried to reach Janet, couldn't.
So I was stuck. Listing said ""no refunds"". There were no hotels in area. It was getting dark.
what should have been a stress free stay in a cute cottage turned into an expense ridden journey, where I had to backtrack many miles to find a hotel. Additionally spent a good four hours in text and phone conversations with Air bnb just to get a refund for this place.
Dont be surprised if you get no response from host after paying!"

The house is very spacious and provided us with the best comfort. Very good bedding, well-equipped kitchen, modern bathroom, we live very well in this house. And especially the house is air-conditioned, a huge Plus in this area where it is warm and heavy in summer. The House is in the village close to the few shops and a pretty park.

We love sitting on the front porch, watching the world go by. The location couldn't be better - 3 blocks to downtown, with wonderful restaurants, some cute shops, the Delphi Opera House, and two galleries offering the work of local artists. Tyler is an exceptional host (and I've experienced several)... he responds in seconds to questions, he provides timely and comprehensive information about the house, and - most of all - he offers a truly lovely home for his guests. Don't miss looking through his books on local history and interest in the library. And enjoy sitting at the kitchen table with your cup of coffee in the morning, looking out at the lovely patio area. We love Sterling House!"

The outdoor space and porch were lovely and it was a quick walk to downtown. The book was a nice touch with nearby local attractions. Tyler was a great communicator and was very accommodating. Thank you for sharing your beautiful historic home with us and for keeping it so pristine! It’s great to see someone love and care for the architecture. Thanks again!"

Group trip","A beautiful 120-year-old home. The detail of the interior woodwork was amazing. We spent a lot of time just visiting on the wrap around porch, a great place to just relax and enjoy the area. The house was stocked with everything we needed for our 3-day visit. The library was also a nice place to relax and unwind after a busy day.
The location was perfect for walking to the downtown area and availability to hiking trails.
Tyler's communications for entrance and details of what to expect at the house were excellent.
Would definitely stay here again when in the Delphi area.

Tyler provided emergency information in binders at the entrance doorway, menus, historical information about the house and plenty of amenities.

Stayed with kids","We stayed at this location during the week leading up to New Year's. This house is really interesting in its like staying in your very own game of ""Clue"". Yes, I mean the board game. The house is very nice and the very beautiful. It is just not a very inviting space. The furniture reflects the home, but doesn't invite one in to sit down and relax. It feels more like staying in a museum than a home. If you have something going on in Delphi (my in-laws live there), the location is awesome, right on the main street. I will tell you that its easy to get caught up in the aura of an old home next to a funeral parlor. I left several lights on as it can be a little creepy in the middle of the night going for a drink of water."

Stayed a few nights","If you are visiting friends or family in the Delphi area; if you want to spend a few days taking in the historic trails and sights of Carroll County; or if you just want to get away from it all for a few days and stay in a lovely, tranquil little slice of heaven, this house is for you. My sister and I just completed our second stay at Sterling House - this time, we were there for 3 nights. You just can't beat the location - we walked to the Pub and Fika and the Chapel Gallery and the Opera House and the grocery store and strolled the historic homes in the neighborhood. Lots of parking out front, if you have more than 2 cars. And you will love sipping a cup of coffee, sitting at the kitchen table in the quiet morning, watching the red squirrel that hangs out in Tyler's back yard. Tyler is easy-peasy to work with. Responds almost before you ask the question. I look forward to staying at The Sterling House again."

It was perfectly located and plenty of room for six of us. Not only to my brothers house but to the small little town. It was walking distance to the courthouse, art galleries, little shops, restaurants, and bars. This house is absolutely incredible. My father is a finish carpenter from back in the day and was really impressed with all the woodwork. It was hard to get him to leave the library where he had his coffee every morning. I preferred the veranda, especially on the rainy days with a beverage. Anyone who stays here will not be disappointed."

The beds are incredibly comfortable and he had everything we could possibly need. A quiet neighborhood in walking distance to a few nice eateries and drinks which is great considering no Uber in the area. A great home full of charm and character. The library was one of my favorite places to sit and read. Every day we found something charming and intriguing in the home. Thank you Tyler for being such an incredible host!

We were torn between wanting to stay on the amazing and relaxing front porch...or be inside to feel the history of this ""cozy museum"" built in 1900...or walk on any of the many, many trails right nearby...or visit all the great parks. We definitely needed more time!! We had everything we needed and communication with Tyler was fantastic! We desperately hope to be back for another visit soon!"

Stayed a few nights","We were looking for an extended weekend getaway in a nice, quiet place, and Tyler's place checked all the boxes. This 120 year old home is oozing with character - each room distinctive, tastefully decorated, and just a really comfortable space. We especially liked spending time on the wide front porch, just watching the occasional person pass.
The house is two blocks away from the grocery, a nice pub, a great sandwich shop, and a bakery. It was easy to get around both by car and on foot.
Tyler has decorated the house with a huge collection of Purdue memorabilia - a nifty treat if you're an alumnus or a fan of the university - yet tasteful enough to not offend your sensibilities if you root for that other school.
We were particularly impressed by how quiet the place was. Despite the bedrooms being at the front of the house, traffic noise didn't disturb our sleep - the house itself has good sound isolation, and the road isn't terribly busy, despite being near everything.
Tyler prepared lots of helpful documentation on the area and the house itself. Communication was great. Very easy and relaxing stay. We'll definitely look to stay here next time we're in Delphi."

Every aspect was taken care of, from linens to kitchenware to comfort. If you’re a history buff, Tyler has the house fully stocked with tidbits of Delphi and local history as well.
While there isn’t much to do in Delphi itself, you’re halfway between Monticello and Lafayette. We spent the afternoon on a pontoon boat on Lake Shafer, which was a short 20 minute drive away. Delphi is the perfect location.
And if you’re looking for a good meal, the Brick and Mortar Pub is 3 blocks away and has fantastic food. We ate there 3 times over our weekend stay. I can’t recommend it enough."

Stayed a few nights",This house was perfect for our stay in town to visit family. Great walking location to the downtown restaurants and grocery store. House was very clean. Loved the kitchen and being able to cook in the house versus eating out the whole time. Tyler has thought of every detail to help a stay at this location to be thoroughly enjoyable and thoughtful. Tyler was quick to respond to all of our questions. This will definitely be our go to place for when we have to come to town!

Brick and Mortar pub and Cabos Mexican good places to eat and relax. Delphi is nice quiet town with antique shops and library that one needs to schedule time in itinerary to enjoy.

Stayed a few nights","We arrived there around 9 pm. So it was dark. We opened a kitchen side door and turned on light.
We were surprised, because the kitchen in front of us looked so amazing. But that was just a start. As we went into the house through a dining room, a living room, a TV room, and a front porch, we were overwhelmed by the sight folded before us.
We are all Asian business travelers. We used to stay at hotels. Always the same. Not bad. But boring. This time we decided to try AirBnB, because it would be a great opportunity to have a glimpse on life in the USA at a different stand point of view.
This house is the best case for what we tried to look for.
Basically, the house was very clean and everything was working fine.
Very convenient and comfortable.
i thought this house itself can be a good travel destination.
I would like to thank the host for sharing this house."

Stayed a few nights","This beautiful Victorian home was just beautiful as pictured and what we expected. The beauty and elegance of the stately mansion could be seen throughout! The woodwork was so beautiful and Tyler’s patriotic passion for our country (and the Purdue Boilermakers-Boiler up!) was evident. It made us even more comfortable seeing that! Speaking of comfortable, the Temper-pedic beds...they were very comfortable!! Much better than I expected and we slept so well! We spent each evening in the Library. I loved that room. The whole place was so comfortable and cozy! Now..onto the host...I’d like Airbnb.com to know that Tyler was the absolutely best host anyone could hope for. Tyler was so accommodating to every need or request we had. You will not find a better host-I dare you!! I can’t say enough and I can’t thank you enough, Tyler! We will most definitely be back for years to come! PS. My Purdue daughter and her friend enjoyed this little get-away from campus too!❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸"

The home is within walking distance of quaint and lovely downtown Delphi and within driving distance of the many activities that the area has to offer. The home is spotlessly clean and the host provides lovely towels and every kitchen appliance and utensil imaginable. The library is full of interesting books and the house is supremely quiet -- I read two books and several magazine articles while I was there. The backyard and front porch are good for relaxing.

He even gave me a quick tutorial over the phone on everything in the house once I was there. I couldn’t have had a better experience not to mention the Victorian house was absolutely beautiful! My family could have spent a few days looking at everything in the house! Highly recommend!!!!

Stayed a few nights","Where to begin... OK - let me start at the beginning. Tyler responds almost within seconds, any time you ask questions. The check-in process was easy peasy.
And then there's that house. Oh my gosh - to be able to stay in an historic home like Sterling House is such a privilege. Tyler has furnished it with fabulous antiques (be sure to check out the round desk in the upstairs turret). We enjoyed every part of the house, though we found ourselves using the library, kitchen table, and front porch as the spots to visit with friends and drink our coffee and wine.
The house is spotless, and Tyler provides plenty of fluffy towels and amenities in the bathrooms and kitchen to make your stay easy.
The location of this home couldn't be better. We could walk three blocks to the Brick and Mortar Pub and the Delphi Opera House Gallery and the shops in downtown Delphi. There's always plenty of parking on the street in front of the house, in addition to the two spots at the side.
Let me point out two aspects that make this particular house so special. Tyler is a Delphi guy who loves his community, and it really shows in the photos and artwork by local artists displayed in his house. In addition, he has an extensive collection of books about local history which he offers in the lovely library. You can't help but feel the history of this small town.
Which brings me to the second ""plus:"" this gorgeous historic home sits among many gorgeous (or becoming gorgeous or potentially gorgeous) historic homes. Sit on the front porch and look across the street at the transformation going on at a Victorian mansion and at a beautiful example of mid-century limestone ranch homes situated on a 3-acre wooded lot. Walk around the neighborhood and see example after example of classic architecture.
Delphi is a lovely historic town with many attractions - the Opera House and Gallery, the Wabash and Erie Canal Center, the Historic Hiking Trails, Riley Park, Deer Creek; and Sterling House is a perfect home base for exploring and getting a feel for this charming community. I definitely will return to Sterling House (and I'll bring friends!). I highly highly recommend it. Well done, Tyler."

The price for one night was cheaper than the price for one hotel room for one night which was great. The house was clean, instructions were clear, and the kitchen and living room were roomy. There was plenty of room for 6 adult sized people and our 9 year old. Patricia had a few small snacks set out (granola bars, crackers, pop tarts), which I was not expecting, but appreciated. There was also a variety of coffee and teas to choose from and lots of dishes and cookware to use if needed. Patricia was very quick to respond to any message or question I sent, even weeks before our check in. I would definitely stay at this house again if we were in the area."

Stayed with kids","We stayed three nights at Patricia’s. It was quiet, clean and cozy - just what we needed as we came and went visiting family. We felt we had everything we needed. The only negative was the Wi-Fi was very slow. Not too big a deal for us but maybe it would be for others. I would definitely like to stay again!"

Group trip","Wonderful home and great location. Our daughter and three grandsons stayed in Patricia's home while we visited family in Logansport and Kokomo. Easy check in, very clean, relaxing atmosphere. Definitely recommend and will stay again if dates available. Thank you."

Stayed with kids",It was just as described. Quiet and plenty of room for all of us. Comfortable and clean. The only small issue we had was the front step is a little high for someone with mobility issues. The host was extremely helpful and accommodating. We would definitely stay again when we are in town.

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at Patricia’s. The home was comfortable, clean and well-stocked. Communication was excellent. The house is also well- located on a large lot. There was ample safe parking. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Our team really enjoyed their stay at Patricia's residence. The house was very clean, warm and inviting and the snacks were an awesome touch. If we're ever in the area again, we'll be sure to book this home, which was so much more relaxing than a local hotel. Thank you for your hospitality and for sharing your home with us!!"
