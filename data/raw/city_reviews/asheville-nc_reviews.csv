Stayed with a pet","Everything that’s already been said about the Summit House is spot on. The views were spectacular, the house was spotless and beautiful, and the amenities were top notch. Bed was super comfortable, too! The best part were the little details. The welcome note and bottle of wine on arrival, extra towels labeled for the dogs, and the detailed instructions and responses from Matthew and the team. Would recommend over and over."

My mother and I spent a wonderful Mother’s Day weekend here and it could not have been any more perfect. The stunning views cannot be put into words. The accommodations are stellar and I wish I could have stayed longer. Matthew and team are top tier hosts who will make you feel welcome and are genuinely very helpful with any questions you may have. If you stay here, you very well may become a repeat guest!"

Stayed with a pet","The views from this house really do take your breath away! We learned that weddings take place at this property and now I know why! My husband and I had the chance to enjoy our babymoon at this stunning property and we were not disappointed. One of our highlights was the private dinner by Chef Ashley. Also It’s not very often you find Airbnbs of this caliber that allow pets, so we were thrilled we could bring our goldendoodle along with us. The hosts were top notch & gave recommendations for trails in the surrounding area too. Not a far stray from Asheville, this property is worth every penny. Don’t hesitate to book!"

From the moment you step through the doors and from every room you have breathtaking views. My husband and I felt right at home and were easily able to relax and unplug! Asheville is right up the road (25 min) if you want to spend a day exploring the food + breweries.
Matthew and his team were pleasant, super responsive, and proactive in offering recommendations in the surrounding areas.
I highly recommend booking the summit house on your next mountain getaway."

Stayed a few nights","As amazing were the landscape views, I must speak on the customer support team first. By far the .ost pleaseant and fast replies and their attentiveness to your concerns/questions/requests was so thorough and made every depth of my needs full filed. Outstanding isn't enough to represent their customer service, they go above and beyond—(Ashley is a superstar BTW!)—to make sure you everything is up-to-par or beyond. We had the best experience, I highly recommend this stay, the beds were clean, kitchen was tidy, and bathrooms were spotless.
The team did me so many favors on the extra services i requested and not once was i disappointed. 11☆/10☆ + out of this world service, and the views are breathtaking. Hesitating to book will be your only regret if you do.
The Sunrise here will melt together your significant other's soul with yours, it was surreal, like biblical art to say the least. We both agreed it was by far the most romantic viewscape we'd seen.
Thank you for everything!"

Stayed one night","I booked this airbnb as a last minute get away and was blown away! The photos were already amazing but it was even more incredible in person. The home itself was beautiful, modern, spotless, and had everything you could possibly need. The sunset and sunrise were magical and I highly recommend waking up early enough to catch it. The house was easy to access and the gated community made it feel extra safe. The location was wonderful and less than a 30 min drive to downtown Asheville.
Matthew and his team were extremely responsive and quick to answer and questions I had! I would definitely book this airbnb again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a ""destination"" Airbnb in my mind, what am I trying to say... there are many places to explore yet my wife and I have done that on past visits to this area. This home.... its construction, interior design finishes and overall esthetics are suburb. I served Marriott Hotels for 35 years and worked closely with all their Brands including Ritz-Carlton, this home exceeds any lodging expectations for me and I would believe most everyone! I cannot give any better praise to Matthew and his team Ashley & Bruna. We do hope to return to The Summit. Best regards, John & Patty Marotto"

Stayed with a pet","Peaceful and beautiful cabin with everything you need to enjoy a relaxing vacation. Our hosts were very responsive and communicative. A bit of information that others might find helpful: we were able to accomplish the drive up with a front wheel drive compact suv. We arrived in the evening, so having a flashlight in hand was helpful to unload. The cabin is high up on mt Pisgah and there aren’t any streetlights so it is a bit dark, but the wonderful thing about this is there is very limited light pollution so you have a beautiful view of the stars on a clear night! The windows are big and beautiful. There aren’t any shades and the bedroom does face east, so I would anticipate being able to see the sunrise every morning. It can be very bright, so as long as you prepare with an eye mask or covering, you’ll be able to sleep in more comfortably. The place is equipped with a propane fireplace which is remote controlled so you can instantly click on the cozy vibes with the push of a button."

Stayed with a pet","The view! This spot is very private, literally at the top of a mountain with the next neighbor not in eye or ear shot. So you if are looking for a spot that is right in the downtown Ashville mix, this is the not the place for you (the drive is about 30 mins away from downtown). If you are looking for a quite, private, peaceful getaway with an incredible view and modern space and amenities, this is your spot!
The hosts were proactive in their communication, offered clear directions, and local suggestions, and were responsive.
The space was modern, loaded with all things you need in the kitchen (we cooked) and do laundry (i actually want to get the washer and dryer they have, they were great!).
Following the directions the hosts provided, it was easy to find and easy to get into the property.
A bottle of wine was welcoming us when we walked in, which is always a nice touch and appreciated :)
Overall, we would highly recommend this spot."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t even put into words how incredible our stay was here. You open the front door & are immediately surrounded by the beauty of the majestic mountains. We were in absolute awe & overwhelmed with gratitude throughout the entire duration of our stay. The floor to ceiling windows provide you with stunning views no matter where you are in the house. Waking up early afforded us breathtaking sunrises on the deck with coffee followed by yoga overlooking the mountains while basking in the sunshine. We spent hours reading on the most comfortable couch we have ever sat on that makes you feel like you’re truly on cloud 9. Everything in this home is pristine. Bedroom, bathroom, shower, kitchen, living area, outdoor deck, it’s all immaculate- a dose of luxury living at its best. The hosts were excellent as well. We absolutely loved our stay & are already planning a time to come back. Hands down the best airbnb for any mountain lover. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I came up for the weekend to relax in the mountains as my Birthday gift. I feel like I was gone for a week because we unwinded immediately in the peace of the views and the grace of the home. The bathtub was amazing to watch the sunrise from. Having a morning coffee on the side porch in the cool mountain morning air was reviving. Hanging out in the living room watching the sky all day felt like heaven. We were a little worried about not having WIFI but it was no problem at all my AT&T service was fine there and his Verizon service was ok most of the way. The guidelines & directions they give you are all you need. I can't say enough good things about this place. It blew us away and melted weeks of work stress away. I loved staying here and I plan on returning again in the future because it was so special. Thank you Matthew and Ashley for your responsive communication and accommodating ease and grace around everything. We appreciate you all!

Stayed a few nights","The views were incredible. The house is very open and inviting. We felt for the money there were things that lacked. The bed and pillows weren’t very comfortable, same goes for the living room furniture. The outdoor area is so incredible which is why this next thing was a bummer. I say all this knowing it’s the smoky mountains and there’s a lot of moisture, but it’s a missed opportunity to be able to enjoy the outside without having to pay for an upgrade. For the money you spend I guess you’d expect to have access to the more desirable outdoor covered deck but you don’t. So the deck we had access to the cushions were constantly soaked and there’s no cover on that level. But the lower level, which is apart of an upgraded listing, has a covered porch that’s only accessible through the other two bedrooms. Not tryin to be snobby just one man’s opinion. Stairs to the better porch or a cover over the main deck would’ve gone a long way. House was stellar aside from these details."

We had a few questions during our stay and the team was very responsive.

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing stay at this beautiful home! The views were breathtaking and the host was very responsive and pleasant. The only downside was that it snowed a few inches on the first day of our stay, and unfortunately, the road leading to the house is not plowed unless there is at least five inches of snow accumulation. This was particularly problematic, as the road was steep and winding, making it unsafe to travel on with even a little bit of snow so we had to cancel our plans for the day. Luckily the sun came out the next day, and the snow quickly melted. To future winter visitors, it is worth noting that the possibility of being snowed-in on the mountain should be taken into consideration. However, the rest of our weekend was lovely and we were able to enjoy the stunning surroundings and some great brunch spots in downtown Asheville. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely recommend the Summit House to others!"

Stayed with a pet","Oh my goodness...what can I say that hasn't already been said in other reviews? The view, the kitchen, the balcony, the shower...all so amazing. The drive up/down the mountain to get here is a little intense but I found it fun. We spent a lot of time on the balcony at night looking up at the stars. Large windows & beautiful view also means LOTS of sun...so if you're a late sleeper, bring an eye mask :) We are early risers so we enjoyed it. The kitchen was a dream to cook in -- for nerds like me, there was a large gas range, beautiful and high quality Bosch appliances, and a SOMA water filter pitcher. I was in heaven. Speaking of heaven, the shower...oh my goodness. Set your temperature and decide how many angles you want to be hit with water! There's a very nice mud room with washer & dryer (& dog towels!), a dressing room with closets & full length mirror, both of which are not pictured on the listening so were a pleasant surprise! The bar has been set high with this property and I plan on staying again!"

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay at the Summit House. The house itself was amazing. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you needed outside of the food. While we didn’t use it, the grill came equipped with charcoal and lighter fluid/lighter. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was luxurious. The view was once in a lifetime! We were lucky enough to see deer and bunny’s on the drive up the mountain. The one thing I’ll mention to be prepared for is that the drive up is intense for those not used to mountain rodes. It included some sharp turns on steep inclines, but that’s to be expected going to a mountain location. It was definitely doable! Overall, it was a house and trip we’ll remember for years to come."

It was an expensive stay for this underpaid school teacher but I’d do it again in a heartbeat because this stay is worth it to me! Views are everything to me as well as a quality, clean, lack of clutter - but fully stocked with what you need or would want, ease of entering was simple and there was an exceptional, supreme, heavenly level of peace that I found by just being here in this home.
Matthew and Bruna are engaged hosts. Not just renting a place. They are responsive, kind and generous. My one night there on my own, was to wake up on my birthday to see a sunrise in the mountains- it was one I’ll always remember- needed no TV, no WiFi, no phones, no entertainments at all because the view and home was enough and more. Exceeded my expectations and I knew it would be good before I arrived but just couldn’t imagine how impressive, awe inspiring and peaceful until seeing all with my own eyes. Grateful they’ve shared such an amazing respite from the world with others to enjoy as well!
Oh and the drive up is good! I was worried about my older, extreme high mileage car and the pull going up the steep, tight switchbacks! But in that last 1/4 mile I put my car in low (not the lowest) and it just climbed right up. The road is good. Never left the place again until checkout time. Grateful. And hope to be able to return again sooner rather than later. ❤️"

The place was very clean, tidy, the kitchen had all of the tools we needed for cooking, instructions were clear, the bed extremely comfy… even the shower was great. This was an escape that both my husband and I needed, and the tranquil beauty around us was just what the doctor ordered. Thank you Matthew for hosting us, we hope to come back again soon!"

Not only was the setting breathtaking, but the home was absolutely stunning. The host communicated all directions for the stay perfectly, was accommodating, and even had a welcome note and bottle of wine waiting for us! The kitchen had everything you need for cooking (which says a lot for us as my boyfriend fancies himself a chef and we stayed in and cooked a lot!), there were laundry supplies, grilling supplies, even toiletries and shower supplies! It was so accommodating that we gave up some hiking days to just relax “at home”. We will definitely be back!!"

Very peaceful, just the get away we were looking for. Close to some great hiking on blue ridge parkway! Will absolutely be back."

Stayed a few nights","I had an amazing weekend stay at the Summit House. It's just like the photos, offering serenity at every turn. The space was very clean, modern, safe and inviting. The house sits high on a mountain, so the views are a sight to behold and you have plenty of privacy to enjoy it. The best parts: watching the sunrise on a clear morning was a show in of itself. And on clear nights, you can even stargaze.
I didn't get to visit as much of Asheville as I had hoped but took advantage of hiking part of the Appalachian Trail - made for the perfect day trip.
Barbara was a great host - she had everything from coffee and tea to bath soaps and toiletries if needed. The only odd part of my time at Summit House was spotting ladybugs inside the home, camping out by the windows mainly. The bugs didn't bother me too much but could be off-putting to someone else. Other than that, I loved my short stay. It's a great place to unwind and escape from the world. I hope to return."

The plateware, silverware, pots/pans, etc were all well maintained and plentiful.
The morning views and quiet were everything we could have asked for as a short getaway from the kids. Hopefully we will be back to Asheville and can stay here again.

We couldn’t have asked for more. This home is stunning and the host was sooooo easy to work with. We will be back if this place is available!!!"

Stayed a few nights","The home and view were beautiful, but the Japanese beetle infestation ruined our trip. The bugs were literally everywhere. A few times we would find them crawling on us as we tried to sit and watch tv on the couch or in the bed. They were on the walls, ceilings, and furniture. We actually spent time trying to clean them up ourselves but more just came in. It was an unsettling experience with a gorgeous view. We were told the beetles are only there for a few weeks and we were unlucky that we happened to book during that time."

Barbara was extremely responsive to our needs and we are so lucky that this Airbnb worked out for our trip to celebrate our would-have-been wedding date, buying our first home, and my fiance's birthday!

The views are indescribable amazing, light changes by the minute and you can easily spend a week just sitting on the deck and looking at the mountains and the clouds. The house is outstanding, kept impeccably clean and with all necessary little things in the kitchen and bathroom which will make you feel at home instantly. We had the privileged of meeting Barbara and she is absolutely as sweet in person as she is in her nearly instant messages. All in all, probably the top of our Airbnb experiences ...ever! Only drawback: you might want to never leave the place :)"

The patio is a lovely place to hang-out all times of day. The house is spacious and beautiful. I enjoyed cooking in the kitchen. The location is very private but also easy access to Candler (10 minutes) and Asheville (25 minutes)."

The bathroom is unbelievably amazing and there are so many windows letting in a lot of natural light. The road was definitely steep getting up to the house, but worth it. Only complaint: needs WiFi! Our service was so-so, so the fact that there wasn’t any WiFi at this price was somewhat disappointing. Otherwise, we loved it and would stay again in a heartbeat."

Stayed a few nights","The house and views were extraordinary! The pictures are amazing, but the home and view exceed expectations. You can see the whole valley and feel like you are perched in the sky. The house is gorgeously designed and in great shape. The only thing I'd say about the house is that the location is a bit of a double edged sword. It's private with amazing views but it is also a bit isolated. Getting to Asheville takes about 30 minutes which can be a bit much if you just want to pop in for a meal. It's possible, but requires a bit more time and prep. It's manageable, but something to know ahead of time.
Barbara is a wonderful host! She was really responsive, communicated with us really well and made our check in and stay really excellent. She was a fantastic resource and we loved meeting her."

Stayed a few nights","Wizard’s Hollow is truly a magical experience. One of the coolest places I’ve stayed. You can’t beat the view!! Spectacular sunsets. One thing to note is that the drive up to the house is steep and narrow, so keep that in mind. Wasn’t an issue for us, but certain cars might struggle a bit. Check in instructions were very detailed and helpful, we had no trouble finding our way. Such cool and unique design choices throughout the house - my personal favorite being the spiral staircase which lights up at night. Floating candles were a fun touch as well. If you love Harry Potter and mountain views, you have to stay here! We plan to book another treehouse in the future as well!"

The place was just as described and clean with a beautiful view. It was quiet and peaceful.

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Wizards Hollow was truly magical. From the moment we drove onto the property we felt like we were transformed into the world of Harry Potter. The treehouse was perfect with so much attention to detail. My kids loved roasting marshmallows over the ""caldron"" fire pit outside and playing with the harry potter themed games and activity books. The wrap around porch offers 360 views of gorgeous mountain skyline. The beds were comfortable and we loved the soft harry potter themed blankets too! Caroline and Mike were very friendly and easy to communicate with. The treehouse is very close to downtown Asheville where we enjoyed the pinball museum and eating at delicious local restaurants. The neighboring houses in what my kids called ""the magic village"" were also uniquely themed fun tiny houses which my kids had a blast looking at and planning which one we will stay at next. We will definitely be back and can't recommend this property enough! Experience of a lifetime!"

Stayed a few nights",The view from the deck was absolutely breathe taking!!!! It was better than we could've imagined. The harry potter decor for Wizards Hallow was subtle and perfect. Not over the top cheesy but felt like we were in the Harry Potter world. The drive up to the treehouse was a little scary the first time but after a few times it was fine. We LOVED it and will be coming back in the future to stay in the other houses they offer.

They explored every nook and cranny, reveling in all of the over the top touches, from a Wizards Hollow scavenger hunt to the video cache. In addition to being magical, it is a beautiful place worth the stay for those who are not Wizards and Witches fans. I wish there was a longer reservation available for the dates we were in town!"

The place is super cute and the decor is so detailed--plus the views are incredible!! We had one tiny issue with the TV and Caroline and Mike responded within five minutes and the handyman was over to fix it within ten minutes! He recommended Blue Mountain pizza, which was soooo good, and which is just a short drive down the hill. Of course we wanted to do a Harry Potter marathon, and they do have the Harry Potter DVDs at Wizard's Hollow, plus access to HBOMax where the films are currently streaming. No HP books, though, so if you're planning to read, make sure to bring your copies! :)
All in all, a great trip, and we'll definitely stay here or at one of their other properties again!"

The cabin was clean and our hosts were responsive. Quick note if you are staying longer than a night or two--storage is limited to a small dresser in the stairwell and there is no storage in the bathroom and limited counter space. We had a hard time keeping our stuff organized. There are beautiful windows all around which is wonderful for the views and natural light, but there are only 2 with shades---so we were up with the sunrise."

Stayed one night",A nice getaway place to stay and relax. Treehouse was cleaned and bed was comfortable. Very quiet place to relax and enjoy your time. If you do plan on staying here. If you have a car with low ground clearance. Don't take it! Drive something else. The road is gravel. This could cause some issues when the gravel is newly put down. Not compacted yet.

Stayed with kids","Definitely unique! It was a great space and perfect for any Harry Potter fan. Just a couple of things to note - and I may not have paid enough attention to the pictures to realize this. First, the bedrooms are kind of connected to each other. You have to go through one to get to the stairs to the loft bedroom. Also, there isn’t an oven (there is a hot plate) so keep that in mind when thinking about meals."

Bonus that is only 10 minutes from Asheville, NC with tons of things to do and places to eat. Caroline and Mike also did a good job navigating us there and providing a lot of information on things to do in the area. We will be looking to stay in another treehouse for next year!"

Stayed one night","This is a must stay! So many adorable little details. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will absolutely love it here! It’s such a magical place. When you first arrive grab the talking sorting hat off the bookshelf and sort yourselves! Such fun! They have all the Harry Potter movies there for you to watch! Pop some (provided) popcorn and relax with amazing Mountain View’s while you watch your favorite HP movie. We didn’t know this until we arrived but there is a pizza place that will deliver. We stopped at a store super near by and brought things to make dinner. The hosts provide a hot plate to heat food, a microwave, dishes, utensils, seasonings, hot sauce, and cooking oils. They also have a coffee maker and tea kettle. The treehouses are located in a gated community which really adds a nice feeling of safety. They beds and linens are all super comfy. My one and only suggestion would be to bring your own pillow if you have neck issues. If you don’t, then you will be just fine! They also provide towels and even makeup removers, cotton balls, and a first aid kit should you need it!"

Stayed with kids","We made a special trip to spend a few nights at the Wizard’s Hollow, because we came for the Hobbit house last year and felt like we needed to return to stay in more of the houses! We had a great time and my ten year olds really relished the imaginative play with the wands and potion books, and we watched the movies on the DVD at the house each night.
The drive on the property feels a bit dodgy if you’ve only got a fairly low-set rear-wheel drive car like me, but take it slow and easy and you’ll make it around the tricky bends just fine. If I came in winter, though, I’d probably bring my Subaru instead!"

After some last second changes to my schedule, I ended up having to cancel a night, and the owner was extremely accommodating - refunding me almost half of my initial payment when they had no obligation to do so. Was willing to work with me to have a morning arrival the place is extremely clean, very modern, and accessible. Wish I could’ve stayed longer, and will definitely be back if I ever travel to Asheville again (and it’s available - last second of course!)."

The communication with the owner by text was great. Donald answered all of my questions. He even turned the heat up for me per my request because is was a chilly day. The neighborhood was cute, peaceful, and walkable. I walked to the West Asheville strip and walked around the neighborhood.
The bed and bedding was sooo comfortable. They even had some little snacks. I love those extra lttle touches. I loved having a kithenette and having a space that was all mine instead of inside someone's home. I could tell they put a lot of work into this 1940s garage, making it into something so lovely and keeping it in tip top immaculate shape. The big windows with lots of light were great, as well as the yard. I hung out and ate my lunch outside while the robot mower mowed the yard. He was so cute. If I could add anthing to this amazing space ... I would like a screen door because I love to let all the fresh air in, a bar stool in case someone wants to sit at the kitchen counter to eat, and a step stool under the kitchen sink for those of us who can't reach the dishes in the cabinet above the sink. I would also have loved to have spent some time with the owners to get to know them and learn more about the area since I am planning a move there, hence my visit and stay. But I understand some Air B n B hosts are into that more than others.
Very grateful for the night I had at their sweet studio cottage space!"

Then this little gem of a place popped up and it couldn't have been in a better location. Coffee shops/restaurants/breweries within walking distance. A short Uber ride to downtown. Thanks so much Donald and Leslie! Highly recommend.

You also can't beat the location; about 3 minutes off the highway, surrounded by yummy restaurants and breweries, and about 10 minutes from places like downtown and Biltmore. I loved being in a relatively quiet neighborhood as opposed to the hustle and bustle of other places I've stayed closer to downtown.
I also appreciate it how communicative the hosts were, including letting me know that we could check in early and recommending a yummy pizza spot when we got into town. I will definitely visit the cottage again!"

Stayed a few nights","WOW! Where to start!? This place was an absolute dream. We brought out 7 month old and had her set up in the bathroom because it was so spacious and due to her schedule we didn’t need to use the blinds so we woke up to mountain sunrises every morning and just stunning views. Seeing horses, goats, & donkeys come near your place (there is a fence to keep them from coming too close) and just getting to enjoy that in the morning and evening. To getting to walk around and explore her massive piece of land with pigs, chickens, donkeys, horses, and goats. Then a stunning river where you could fish or kayak in. I mean it’s honestly all out of a fairy tale. Reminded me a lot of Ireland or England. We are already looking at coming back! Catherine took us on a little tour of her place and we got to meet the donkeys up close and that was so much fun. I had no idea how sweet donkeys were. Really just had the best stay and experience. Bed & pillows were incredibly comfortable. All around amazing!!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved staying at Catherine and Rick’s cabin ! The views are breathtaking! The hospitality couldn’t have been better . The farm has so much character with all the animals , the river, the mountains, and camping spots along the river.
Our favorite things about the cabin were the gas fire place, the gas fire pit ,the roll up door, the large deck with wrap around couch ,the comfy bedding, and large bathroom .
One night we sat outside and watched a movie on our laptop by the 🔥 pit. We also sat out there each morning and had our coffee.
On our last morning, we rolled up the door and laid in bed and just marveled at the view .
I have stayed at many Airbnb’s. This was by far my favorite! I will definitely be back.
Take the tour. You get to enact with the miniature donkeys!
There is so much to do within a 10 to 30 min. drive.
We visited Asheville , drove the Blue Ridge Pkwy to Waterrock knob trail. We explored Waynesville. It’s a cool town w/shops , restaurants and breweries."

To start, the river is stunning and there are also multiple streams that run throughout the property and flow right into the river. We loved walking the exploring property with our dog. Of course, we had to stop and say hi to the goats, donkeys, pigs, horses and farm dogs. The pigs always gave us a big laugh. Catherine was also so fun and easy to talk to. They have put so much hard work into this place and thought of every detail. The cabin looks brand new and is spotless. We loved waking up with the big windows and sitting out under the stars at night. Do not hesitate to stay here. You will love it. It was by far our best airbnb stay. Thanks for the special memories."

They have really thought of everything to ensure you have a fantastic stay with Adirondack chairs all over the property for you to enjoy. As great as the property is the hosts set it over the top. Catherine was super responsive, proactive with great restaurant recommendations and took the time to share the details of their working farm. Additionally, we were able to take home some of the pork raised on this excellent property. We will be back in the spring!"

Stayed a few nights","You’re reading these reviews and probably wondering if it’s possibly as good as people say. Well it’s not. It’s better. Words can’t describe how beautiful, peaceful, and completely perfect the place is. We spent 3 days there for a mini honeymoon and I couldn’t recommend it more. Already looking at dates to go back. Catherine is the best and we couldn’t be more grateful for her creating such a wonderful space.
The bed is SO comfortable. The views are insane. It was super clean and tidy. Book this place right now!
We had a blast checking out the cute shops and restaurants in Waynesville. (Boojum Brewery is a must)
Since it gets dark so early now, we brought a projector and a king size flat sheet and had the best little movie night. Would totally recommend - we couldn’t think of anything we’d change.
Catherine, if you decide to put a hot tub in we are moving in. 😂"

Stayed with a pet","This trip exceeded our expectations in every way! The cabin was beautiful with all the modern amenities, the views were spectacular and the hosts were so kind and responsive. Catherine and Rick were the most gracious and kind hosts. We thoroughly enjoyed our meeting them and being able to experience their beautiful property.
Pictures do not do the view and property justice! The cabin is located at the top peak of their property overlooking their farm and a beautiful running river that you can access easily. The cabin was the perfect place to enjoy our anniversary with our dog. The property is very dog friendly and its easy to say that our pup had the time of his life running around the property, meeting the animals and swimming in the river. The farm is located just off of the interstate so getting there was very easy it was only a short drive into town.
If you are looking for a relaxing weekend in the mountains, this is the place. 10 out of 10 would recommend, we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was absolutely fantastic! We had a set back in our schedule and weren’t able to get in until almost midnight- Catherine ensured that the lights were left on for us and the door was open to make the process easy. It’s a bit tricky navigating how to get to the cabin, especially at night, but the directions were clear!
When we woke up the first morning we were absolutely in awe of the view- breathtaking! We spent the day in Asheville the following in smoky mountain national park, both were easily drivable from the cabin, 30 mins and 1.5 hours respectively. Our last night we were able to enjoy a nice fire in the fire pit and look at the stars like you would never see in Baltimore 😂
We so wished we had planned a longer trip to soak in more time at this space, we will 100% be back again to enjoy all Catherine and her farm has to offer! You truly have to see it to believe how wonderful this place is!"

The bed is VERY comfortable and the surroundings are peaceful and beautiful. We slept easily for almost 12 hours the first night post-wedding. It is easy to unplug and be present. It's also very close to Waynesville, Maggie Valley, Pisgah, Asheville, and Smoky Mountain National Park - about 15-45 minutes to each of these locations. It feels both central and remote."

We were able to get some good sun in the lounge chairs and you can lay and listen to the river down below. Catherine was an amazing host. So glad to have met her. My daughter and I immensely enjoyed the farm tour. Seeing the horses and goats grazing outside the house in the evening was enjoyable.

Words can’t describe how you feel when you reach the top of the hill where the cabin is. It’s sooooo beyond beautiful and peaceful.
The fog in the morning is so cool to watch roll in and out. And at twilight, lightning bugs come out to play! It was magical!
Our big dog had the time of her life running around, in the river and exploring the farm with us. And got to meet Stetson the farm dog too, who is very sweet.
The cabin is super clean and exactly as described. Grocery store and restaurants in Waynesville 10 mins away. If you have a dog with you, go to the Smokey Mountain Dog Bakery in Waynesville…such a great shop and friendly people.
We bought some Mangsalita pork from Catherine as well and cant wait to try!
PS- the horses and goats come by the cabin around 8pm and they loved carrots and apples!"

We loved the pigs and all the other animals, and had Rick drop us 3.5 miles up the river one day for a float down with our tubes. The rapids can get a little tricky at spots and deff needs a solid river tube as you will hit some rocks along the way. We are already planning to come back for a visit in the future. Maybe even for a camp along the river instead."

She met us at the gate and led us up to the Airbnb on the property. It was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in and was well stocked with everything we possibly could have needed. The views are incredible and walking around the farm to see all of the animals was so fun. We ordered the spicy sausage from Catherine who brought it right to our door. It was absolutely delicious. It felt good staying in an Airbnb that supports a small farm and local business. We absolutely want to come back. I cannot recommend this Airbnb or a camping trip to the farm more highly.

The land has pigs, horses, donkeys, goats, and the sweetest farm dog. We strolled along the river and visited the animals during our stay which was so much fun. The space itself is very clean and beautifully designed. The bathroom is large and comes with lots of towels. The bed is so soft and makes me hate my bed at home haha. There is no TV or microwave, but there are lots of pots, pans, eating utensils- basically everything you need to heat up or cook food. The toaster oven came in handy to heat food up quickly. Catherine was so attentive and communicated back almost immediately after I asked a question. The location is about 10 minutes from a grocery store and 30 minutes from Asheville."

Horses, goats, and donkeys came up close to the fence near the cabin which was one of our favorite parts! Just felt like heaven!
The owner listed out items that were in the cabin and a list of potential items you should bring. Pay attention to that list. We met both of the owners and they were both so nice and appreciative of renting their space and helping out their farm.

We had a lovely time sitting by the fire, stargazing on the lawn chairs, cooking on the grill, and going on a farm tour (which included feeding the donkeys!).
This cabin is especially great for animal lovers. There are donkeys, horses, goats, and the unique Hungarian mangalitsa pigs roaming the farm, with some even spending time very near the cabin.
Catherine and Rick were wonderful hosts who made us feel right at home; they were attentive and friendly and taught us a lot about how they run the farm.
The drive up to the cabin is steep but worth it for such majestic views. If you're an early riser, you can see the breathtaking fog amongst the mountains.

The bed and sheets are absolute luxury, better than any hotel! Catherine’s communication is prompt and thoughtful!

Stayed with a pet","i absolutely loved this spot. me and my girlfriend have made a hobby to secluded a little air B&Bs that are worth their price point and everything about this airbnb hit it perfectly. for us it’s easily top 8 of the hundreds we’ve been too. It is such a perfect romantic getaway spot. with great views and awesome trails to walk. and don’t forget to bring your pups because my dog absolutely loved the area it’s fenced it very well so both your furry kids and the local wildlife are safe. the kitchen is a little hard to work with but you’ll manage as i was able to make some good breakfast, lunch, and dinner with what’s in the kitchen area."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing!! I feel blessed to have found this location. The whole experience from the day of booking till the day we left was 10/10!! I would recommend this to everyone that is looking to truly have some peace and tranquility. The views are stunning day and night!
Relaxing on the hammock at night looking at all the stars was definitely something we enjoyed! Even napping on the chairs outside during the day was very enjoyable because of waking up to those awesome views.
We enjoyed seeing our neighbors (the farm animals!) from a distance. The mangalitsa pigs is something you have to see in person! Always learning something new, never knew pigs like that existed!
Everything was clean, comfortable and perfect! We didn’t walk around the farm and explore but next time we will for sure!!
Location is perfect. Decent drive to go on hiking trails or going to explore Asheville.
Catherine is GREAT!!!! She went out of her way to talk to us the day we left. She made it that much more special!!"

The view from the cabin is just breathtaking—mountains, the Pigeon River, and all of the farm animals grazing. Catherine was super helpful and quick in responding to my many questions. She even hand drew us a map of the property. It was great having full access to explore the property and fish the river. Love that the place is pet friendly and we could bring our pup! She loved exploring the grounds. The farm is in such a great location, secluded and quiet, yet close to the interstate, gas stations, stores, and restaurants. We even brought some Mangalitsa sausage home with us. Catherine made this process super easy. Great place, would definitely stay again!"

This place was all that! The horses just outside our cabin in the morning added to the beautiful view. The cabin in the sky is beautifully decorated and impeccable. The bed and bedding is better than what you find in luxury hotels and the place has everything you need. The only thing we didn't anticipate was the steep, gravel road leading up to cabin. Going up was a bit nerve wracking for my 84 yr old mom but after a few trips up and down, she was fine and then it was...Wow... what a view! You will love the host too, Catherine was personable and accommodating to us during our stay. We highly recommend this place!"

Stayed with a pet","Little Mountain A Frame is absolutely incredible. My wife and I have stayed at airbnbs all over the world and this is the best one yet. We brought our 5 month old twins and dog (as advertised, not kid friendly but easy for the infants). The a frame itself is incredible. Every detail is well thought out from the record player to the decor which made this place special. The back porch provides immediately relaxation along with the reading nook. We also drove into Old Fort for a beer and food at Hillman Brewery (10/10). We had some rough weather during our trip and Shealy checked in on us multiple times to make sure we were okay and if we needed anything.
Overall Shealy’s place is perfect and she is an amazing host. Book without hesitation. We would love to stay again!"

I wanted us to get a feel for ""tiny"" cabin living in the NC mountains, but this place actually felt very spacious and nothing about it felt cramped or left us wanting. Besides enjoying getting away from work for a couple nights, we loved the privacy, the full kitchen, the hot tub, the warm blankets, the proximity to the downtown area of Black Mountain with their bookstore and ice cream shop, the cute decor and architectural design, the easy check-in and check-out, the friendly instructions from Shealy, the soft lighting, the roomy showers, the view, the option to have a campfire outside, the option to bring our dogs if needed... We were very pleased with our relaxing stay and want a place like this of our own, tucked away in the mountains! Thank you Shealy for sharing your cabin with us!

The layout was so well thought out and I truly felt at home. I cooked each night and they have thought of everything you could need. It was perfectly stocked with amazing touches without feeling cluttered. The house was decorated for Christmas and the lights and tree were such a nice extra touch. Comfortable beds, pillows, couch and chairs. Loved the furniture and plants. The vibe was perfect. I used the fire pit and the hot tub and both were excellent to have and easy to operate. I’d love to come back in the Spring. And again in the Fall. Old Fort was also such a cute little area. Highly recommend the dog friendly Hillman brewery and the cinnamon rolls at Gogo’s.

Stayed a few nights","First, Shealy is just a pleasure to converse with! She has thought of everything when it comes to spending time in their gorgeous A-Frame. The location was exactly what we were looking for – secluded but not too far from busier cities like Black Mountain & Asheville. Shealy thoughtfully decorated for the holidays & it made the place feel so magical. You can tell they put a ton work & love into this place. My husband is a contractor & usually when we go places he is critiquing, but it was even wildly impressed with finish work and details. This home is so warm & full of good energy & beautiful crystals. The kitchen is completely stocked w/everything you would need. The break from TV screens was so ideal but they do have a record player along with a JBL speaker. The beds and pillows were clouds and even the towels were XL. Pictures do not do this place justice, BOOK IMMEDIATELY while you have a chance.
PS- If you go to Black Mountain on your trip I cannot recommend Bush Farmhouse enough"

Easy and clear check in with keypad…and then you walk in to this incredibly designed down to every single detail space. It’s brand new, super clean and organized. She has thought of literally everything down to leaving you coffee and KIND bars and extra pillows/blankets to ensure you have the most comfortable stay. We ended up making dinner there both nights we stayed because we wanted to soak up as much of our time there as possible. The spa like showers with the push out windows were such a treat to use. The soaking hot tub on the private deck was also amazing. We listened to records and played board games together and were so thankful to be there.
Downtown Old Fort is a cute little town as well. We grabbed some coffee, went to both breweries, found some really great shops and hit up a local potter on our drive back to the cabin!"

Take the back roads, which is far more scenic, and it adds only 5-10 minutes to your adventures. The warm A-Frame was the last house at the end of the road with no one around you. The pleasant, clean, modern inside was a restful place to get away from it all and enjoy being out in nature. Definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",The Little Mountain A Frame is one of our favorite spots we’ve ever visited. The space is even better than the photos! Our little getaway was too short. We will definitely be coming again! The hot tub on the deck was icing on the cake so-to-speak. It was perfect!

Stayed a few nights","I’m not sure I have the words to truly describe the magic of Little Mountain A-Frame ✨ from the incredible piece of land it sits on, to the impeccable design and thoughtful details around every corner, this stay was an absolute dream!
Shealy has a way with making this place truly feel like home while you’re there. It’s was coziest cabin experience I could have ever hoped for. I started following Shealy’s journey of building and designing the A on social media and knew I had to see it in person. It blew all expectations I had out of the water!!
One of my favorite parts was that it’s dog friendly with a completely gated back deck to enjoy time outside with the pups- from morning coffee in the trees, to a dip in the hot tub at any point in the day.
My weekend getaway to Little Mountain A Frame was absolute perfection! Can’t wait to go back! ✨ ⛰️"

Stayed with kids","OMG!!! It’s thrilling magical experience our family recently had at A-frame cozy little mountain 🖤
I obsessed with the collection of Books she have available at her house for the guest to explore the meaningful life inside and outside of her tree house, she also have a collection of game board, camping set, everything she prepared to put with love and creative on the tree house will make your have a wonderful trip at the mountains.
The environment of all the trees surround on front and back of the house, all of the art works, decoration and little note when you arrive to the house will make you feel extremely warm welcome 🤗
Thank you for hosting us at your tremendous cozy A-frame house"

Stayed a few nights","We came to Shealy’s special place for our honeymoon after getting married this month. It was everything we expected plus more. Her attention to detail in her home is incredible. We loved every moment of it. I can’t even begin to describe the outside. Surrounded by nature in the mountain was so peaceful. We enjoyed their new cedar hot tub they put in. It was our favorite part of the whole home. We spent hours in there just drinking some wine after a day spent hiking. Just basking in the warmth and the nature around us. It became our little piece of heaven on earth. Shealy, thank you so much for letting us stay in your incredible home. You were so very accommodating to us both. You’re so sweet. We are definitely coming back every year for our anniversary. We truly didn’t want to leave. We will be back though!"

Stayed one night","What a truly unique and special stay! The attention to detail and design at Little Mountain A-Frame is next level, with so many special touches and details that go well above and beyond any Airbnb I've ever stayed in. I loved walking around the house, taking in all the cozy corners and unique details, but the back deck was our absolute favorite. It's so peaceful and a great place to disconnect, enjoy/ listen to nature. My husband and I went to dinner in Old Fort (which was lovely!) and rushed back to enjoy as much time on the deck as possible.
Shealy + Eddie, thank you for sharing your beautiful a-frame! Your a-frame goes well beyond a five-star stay."

Our golden retriever Macy loved the stairs and cuddling on the back deck, which made us so happy bc she had so much fun as well! Overall we had such a relaxing stay and hope to be back in the near future.
Great local recommendations were provided as well as some in Asheville! We loved being in the mountains but thought it was a good proximity to the city.
Shealy was very informative and helpful throughout our stay. Loved her design and attention to detail!"

Everything about this home is literally perfect. The house itself is brand new and has everything you could possibly need for a relaxing vacation. The ambiance and vibe are amazing, and you'll feel like you're on vacation the minute you arrive. The attention to detail is incredible, and the owners have thought of everything. All you need to do is show up and relax! I will absolutely be coming back to this place for years to come.
They also were extremely sweet and allowed my dog to join. I think the pup loved it more then me! She played in the yard and hung out next to me while I read a book and drank a coffee overlooking the mountains!"

Stayed a few nights","This deserves a 10 start review. My husband and I decided to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary in the mountains- to recharge and check out all the beautiful scenery Western NC has to offer! The cabin itself is warm and welcoming- it was a dream to stay there! You feel welcomed + comfortable as soon as you walk in. Clean + tidy., comfortable bed. Details even in the lower bathroom for us ladies that forget our makeup wash! They have a perfect private location. We enjoyed watching the sun set on the front balcony and listening to the sounds of nature. Turning on the record player. Beautiful hiking trails surrounding and beyond. I feel like there is endless options for foods in both directions, Asheville + Marion. 10 out of 10 recommend, we will be back! Can’t thank our hosts enough for a little anniversary trip without the kids 🖤"

The guidebook was amazing and we were upset we didn’t have time to try more places.
As someone who winds down with a nice hot shower, I did not want to leave the amazing hot water and eucalyptus scent.
I was blown away at the design, the feeling and the energy this place gives. Book it now !! We will be back!"

* extremely clean - practically meticulous
* a great layout for the loft
* the living / dining area is a little smaller than the photos
* the brick patio / balcony is a little bigger than the photos
* 2-4 adults is a perfect fit; or 2 adults with 2-4 kids
* they have some nice extras for little - little kids
* terrific location - everything we walked to was a 3 to 5 to ten minute walk
* owners are super / Uber responsive and patient- trust me. I ask A LOT of questions
* parking - bad news you pay; good news about 30 - 90 feet from the front door
* location - Rankin Social Club - great burgers, Bahmi, cocktails, about a 45 second stroll. High Five coffee - just okay - but the Lox sandwich on an everything bagel - rock star! A 30 second walk.
* Sage coffee - yes! Great breakfast sandwiches and coffee - 3 minute walk
* so many shops within a 1, 3, 5, 10 minute walk…."

Stayed a few nights","Great location!! You are in the center of restaurants and shopping. Coffee shop right outside entrance. Beautiful condo with exposed brick; outdoor patio and furnished with everything you need. And; if you’re worried about privacy with the bedrooms being open above, don’t give it a second thought! They have a wonderful integrated white noise system. We didn’t want to leave. Amazing place!! They also texted us that the condo was available if we wanted to check in early. Thanks so much Andrew and Ashlie."

Stayed with kids","My family really enjoyed our stay! Everything was very walkable, the neighborhood felt safe, and the loft was incredible. We loved how well-stocked the kitchen and bathroom were. The smaller bedroom was perfect for our 6yo - she had her own space that was just her size, and my husband and I had a private guest suite. The beds were comfy with quality linens, and everything was clean. Overall, everything just felt very high-end. Unfortunately, it was too cold to enjoy the balcony, but it would have been amazing with warmer weather. There was definitely a lot of street noise, so beware if you're a light sleeper. :) Overall, the place was amazing and we would highly recommend staying here if visiting Asheville and you want something centrally-located and walkable."

Stayed a few nights",The location was absolutely perfect! Huge perk was the parking deck right across the street even though the car wasn’t needed until we checked out! I didn’t know how I would feel about the open ceiling concept but the built in sound machines helped to cover our snoring friends. Plus plus plus. My favorite part about the place is being able to drink my coffee (that I got from the coffee shop next door!) on our private balcony. 10/10 would recommend.

Pro tip since this stay is in town: we always travel with disposable earplugs, so I’d recommend it if you’re a light sleeper. There is a white noise machine though if you need it. We had an awesome time and would definitely stay there again!"

The accommodations were fantastic and Ashlie was super prompt to respond to the messages I sent during our stay. Unfortunately, our visit took place when the weather had a 20 degree drop, so we weren’t able to lounge on the balcony, which was a bummer - but that outdoor space would be sooooo amazing in warmer weather!! The integrated white noise was phenomenal and I will definitely miss it, for sure!! 10/10 stay and would feel very fortunate to enjoy another stay at this loft."

Stayed a few nights","Andrew & Ashlie’s loft was perfect for a girls weekend getaway. The loft was thoughtfully decorated and was equipped with everything you might need. The location was great- close to shops and restaurants. Loft was clean, access was easy and hosts were responsive to our questions. This is a loft and the bedrooms had walls but they did not go all the way up so there was not complete privacy as you could hear conversations etc- this was not an issue for us but might be for families or couples traveling together. A white noise machine is provided and was helpful in blocking out background noise.
Super cute would totally recommend and look forward to visiting again."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent location in the central downtown area! We walked a lot around downtown and took day trips to Chimney Rock State Park, the Biltmore and a No Taste Like Home foraging trip. Parking was free at the garage across the street while we were there except when there was a concert on Saturday evening nearby. Coffee place right next door. The loft was extremely clean and comfortable and also a fun and interesting! The only downside to this place is the open ceiling allows sound and light to travel easily inside. It was plenty dark inside for sleeping and the built in white noise machine was definitely nice for sleeping. However, because of that open ceiling everyone had to be lights out and quiet at the same time. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone, unless traveling with housemates that are loud and like to go to bed at different times."

Stayed about a week","Could not be a better location for exploring Asheville. Centrally located, yet a quiet condo building, with a nice, sheltered outside space. Close to everything, impeccably appointed and decorated, with great kitchen amenities -- we cooked-in and ordered-in a lot, during these COVID times. Sparkling clean and sanitized. Easy garage parking across the street, and generally easy unloading/loading at front of building.
Ashlie and Andrew were great communicators. Especially appreciated Andrew's insight that on-street parking after 6PM was free, which we took advantage of.
The open loft floor plan, where the walls do not go to the ceiling -- as forthrightly highlighted in the Air BNB description -- did not present any issues for us, but are worth considering for a larger group.
We would definitely stay with Ashlie and Andrew again. Having used Air BNB a lot, we consider them model hosts."

Open ceilings over both bedrooms, noise carries a little bit, just be aware extracuricular activities will be limited if sharing the space with others. Amazingly great place in a spectacular location, walking to everything! Fast internet, good hot water pressure, great smelling body wash. Wins all around."

Extremely comfortable loft with everything you could need in the kitchen. Even though it was a cold weekend in December I still had to spend time on the covered patio as it has such a nice view. The check-in was very easy and the building was secure. A parking deck across the street was an added convenience. The surrounding neighborhood was fun and funky and we had a great time exploring the local art galleries, restaurants, breweries, and shops with locally-made crafts. We didn't need our car once while visiting! I highly recommend this lovely space if you want to get a taste of downtown Asheville."

Lastly...the covered balcony is spectacular and we spent lots of time people watching from there. Water pressure, bedding, pillows, are all outstanding. I know it’s cliché but I “highly recommend” and if they ever sell it...I want it. 👍🏻"

You feel like you can really connect with nature and it’s very secluded. Make sure to walk to the pavilion and take the white trailhead to the waterfall. From the cabin to the waterfalls is about a 1.1 mile walk. We were a little nervous getting up to the cabin because the gravel driveway is a little steep. But my 2WD Hyundai Kona did it just fine! We were very impressed by how clean the cabin was. We hope to be back!

We arrived with a two wheel drive small SUV (Corolla Cross) and had absolutely no issues navigating the path to the cabin. Upon our arrival, the host had a cute custom welcome sign that was a nice touch. The rope bridge was super awesome and a dream come true for my inner child. Extremely cozy interior that is perfect for curling up and reading a good book. There is under bed storage drawers for belongings. The deck is large with exceptional views. The hot tub worked flawlessly. Underneath the deck, there is a hammock and ring toss hook game.
The fire-pit area was perfect for us with two chairs and a grill that can be swung over pit for cooking. The ability to purchase firewood from host was very convenient. From the cabin, there are some really cool hiking trails that are perfect for allowing the pet to burn off some energy and explore. This place is a perfect getaway for a couple!"

From the private magnificent views during the day to watching shooting stars and seeing the Milky Way at night, the High Haven Treehouse did not disappoint! Loved visiting with the rescue animals and seeing their fun personalities! We had a small hiccup with the hot tub functioning the first night, due to no fault of their own. When we notified them, they quickly responded and came to the treehouse to solve the issue (and on a Sunday night)! The recommendations for local spots kept us entertained in Marion and Old Fort. Highly recommended for those seeking a peaceful retreat! We are already planning our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
Super communicative hosts who were readily available for questions and proactively sent information that might be needed.
Beautiful space that is accurate to the photos
Thoughtful touches upon arrival
GORGEOUS views
Clean, private, well provisioned cabin.
Fabulous stargazing at night
Cool fire pit space
Clean hot tub was a great bonus!
Not far from Asheville, Black Mountain, and lots of things to do and see.
To know:
As described, the drive up the mountain on the gravel path can be done by a 2WD vehicle. The first ascent was nerve wracking but the hosts gave us the tip to go a bit faster and just keep going and it was fine. We made it all the way to the cabin, rather than the 2WD pull off and went up and down the mountain several times with no issue. But if you’re not used to that kind of driving, it can be scary at first.
Overall an amazing trip and we would definitely go back in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","This airbnb was truly what we needed to relax the stresses of wedding planning away. Our honeymoon here was magical.
There is a waterful to walk to from the cabin, you wake up to mountain views, a hot tub steps away, and a fire pit to use at night. The animals at the entrance were so cute and friendly, that we could not resist stopping (almost) each time we drove by to give them treats in the little cupboard by them. There are plenty of things to do around, we visited little Switzerland a short drive away. The inn had awesome food and VIEWS, felt like you were in Europe. We also stopped at the Altpass Apple Orchard very close and had homemade apple pie. We also visited Mt. Mitchell and Black Mountain. We recommend Eddies Pizza & Pasta (homemade bread an marina are great) in Marion, Black Mountain Bistro in Black Mountain, and the Inn at Little Switzerland for awesome food. 10/10 will return."

So many little touches that took the experience above and beyond - things you didn't even think you would want or need that made the experience even more special. I can't recommend this place enough. Absolutely wonderful and beautiful. My dogs loved it as well! Audra and Summer were very helpful and communicative as well. I hope I can come back someday.

We had no trouble getting up to the cabin in our 4WD RAV4. The two cabins are close by, but you cannot hear or see your neighbors, which was really nice! The bed was extremely comfortable. Loved staying here!"

We drive a large ford transit camper van which isn’t 4wd and I was worried about getting up to the cabin but we were able to just fine. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, spending time on the deck with the gorgeous views and even hiking to the on property waterfall! Oh, and visiting with the most friendly goats, donkey and mini horse on our way out! We didn’t want to leave. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed with a pet","10/10 would stay here again. The hosts have built a small but very well designed spot on the side of a mountain that's perfect for a couple's getaway. Amazing cleared out view of nearby mountains from your private hottub or firepit. Clean and tidy room. Hot water, fridge, and stove as well as all the basics of a kitchen that you'd expect. The hosts provided some great personal touches including treats and a towel for our dog. The hill up to the house is pretty steep but it seems to drain well and was handled easily by our AWD highlander. Hope to be back soon!"

Stayed one night","The treehouse is just like the photos - super clean with a nice view and very private. The unit is well appointed, the furniture is really comfy, the hot tub is great and the smores for the firepit are a really nice touch! The hosts are very helpful and communicative. The only downside is the drive up - I checked the reviews and saw conflicting opinions about whether or not 4WD is necessary. After checking in with the host, we opted to give it a shot in our 2WD car - ended up getting stuck on the last climb, just before the 2WD pull off, and had to get towed up by the hosts. I think it's more about what kind of tires you have, and mine didn't cut it. Something to consider!"

Stayed with kids","High Haven Treehouse was every bit like the photos and description in the listing!
We came here to celebrate our 30th birthdays and our have our last trip as a family of 3 before Baby #2 comes.
The drive up is super doable in a 2-wheel-drive car all the way up to the provided 2wd pull-off point. For us, we were also fine getting beyond that to the treehouse parking.
The treehouse was squeaky clean and stood out because they allow dogs - but not a single allergic reaction was had by those of us in our family allergic to dogs! Not a hair or crumb or streak in sight: perfectly clean.
Beautiful decor, treehouse construction was gorgeous, and welcome goodies were an awesome touch. Clear instructions too!
There was ample space for a pack-n-play to be set up if your little one is too small for the the trundle bed provided. Toddler approved!
We all loved the sweet animals, swinging bridge, hammock, fire, hot tub, and hike to the little waterfall! Book this treehouse!"

Stayed with a pet","The house and property are beautiful. However, I highly recommend having a 4 wheel drive vehicle if you are interested in booking. Note that the 2 wheel drive pull off is only after a lot of steep gravel driving. Although our 2wd SUV has relatively new all terrain tires and we've taken it many similar places, it did not handle the incline/gravel combination prior to the pull off very well. Unfortunately, we did not feel comfortable trying to make the drive up a second time and cancelled our second night. However, Audra and Summer were very understanding and graciously refunded us for the second night. The house and property are beautiful and I highly recommend it if you have a vehicle capable of the ascent. The view from the porch is hard to beat on a starry night."

We appreciated the local recommendations and enjoyed hikes to Still Creek Falls, Tom’s Creek Falls, Crabtree Falls, the Marion Greenway, and Linville Falls. GoGo’s Cinnamon Rolls is a must stop - delicious!
We liked the privacy of being out in nature a bit, but still close enough to drive to Asheville and the Biltmore Estate.
We highly recommend High Haven Cabin to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay."

The views were incredible, the Treehouse itself was adorable, the smell of fresh wood was so nice. We loved sleeping in the comfy bed just steps away from French doors that opened to a private patio with a hot tub! Unfortunately our hot tub didn't work but Audra and Summer were apologetic and responsive about it. Be aware, getting there in 2 wheel drive was hairy and parking impossible. There's a 2 wheel drive pull-off that was helpful, but getting up the hill in wet conditions was low and slow. Recommend 4wd for sure! Overall, a lovely getaway perfect for our honeymoon!"

We went into Asheville before we checked in, and then drove towards the cabin on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The views were incredible, and we did a hike at Craggy Gardens. We also recommend the waterfall hikes at Toms Falls and Roaring Fork...both easy enough for little kids.
We had a great weekend and can't wait to visit in the future. **Bonus tip for 2WD going up the hill...if you aren't used to it, go faster than you think you need too and it's way easier to get to the top then going slower (2nd try tip lol)"

Stayed with a pet","We had an amazing weekend in the cabin. If you are looking for a cooking kitchen, re-think your plans. The small two burner stove is nice but there is no oven and even less counter space, but you can grill on the firepit and the freezer/fridge is a half size so far larger than an average mini-fridge. We got up to the cabin in our 2 wheel drive Ford Escape with no issues but make sure you don't ride in the middle if you are not comfortable driving on steep gravel drives. The walk to the pavilion is short and also gravel but the trail head is there and is amazing! its a short walk to the waterfall and it does not dissappoint! At the foot of the mountain every afternoon we were greeted by all of the goats and donkey and got to feed them coming and going - awesome. The view from the cabin is unparalleled and worth every penny. Bed is super comfortable and I'm a bad sleeper. Marion is a short drive and has plenty of breweries and don't miss Pepperonis pizza on the way back!

The bedroom, a wizard's haven, accommodated us like true Hogwarts champions. The pull-out futon was as comfy as a Hippogriff's nest (really it was quite comfortable, we planned on switching every other night, but didn’t need to). A stay filled with enchantment, perfect for four wizards seeking a spellbinding getaway!"

Stayed one night","There aren’t enough words for how much we loved this place! My son and I were living our best Harry Potter lives! We spent a lot of time investigating the black family tree on the tapestry wallpaper. We filmed several videos using the invisibility cloak. It was easy to cook a full New Year’s Day dinner in the kitchenette with the provided electric burners and supplies. Every square inch was themed perfectly, even the cookware was sparkly! we were only there for one night and it was very cold so we didn’t use the Glamping tent or fire pit, but just poking our heads inside it is beautiful. The bed and futon were both extremely comfortable and I enjoyed sitting by the electric fireplace while my son perched halfway up the slide to watch the movies! A word of caution, some of the road and driveway is gravel and very steep so if traveling during winter months plan to have a 4 wheel drive vehicle or get travel insurance, just in case. We hope we can go back soon!"

Stayed one night","The location is on a private, quiet road in a subdivision. The instructions were very clear, but I recommend arriving during daylight due to the tight turns and construction. We arrived during the afternoon and had no issue finding the place later when we returned in the dark after leaving for dinner in Asheville, which is only 10 minutes away.
The place and location are beautiful and peaceful. I definitely recommend for a relaxing getaway. The decor is great, and a fan of Harry Potter will love the inspiration of the decor. I am admittedly not up on the series, but as a casual fan I still appreciated all of the references I noticed from the HP series. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a huge fan and loved explaining it all to me ;)
The view, originality, and cleanliness of the home all made for a pleasant stay, and the owners are very attentive to detail and are easily in touch if you need them. A great experience over all!"

Every moment was filled with anticipation and Caroline and Mike do not let you down with Alchemy. It was the best time away to celebrate 10 years of marriage. The entrance brought us right into our youth. The details were thrilling to discover. The entire place was clean and comfortable. We decided to stay in and cook our meals and they even provide a means to do that so we didn’t have to miss out on a moment of their fantastic place. The owners were always quick to respond which I highly respect. We highly recommend this place if you are needing a true magical adventure!"

They are building two buildings, one on either side of this one and I think it’ll take away from the peacefulness and seclusion of this one. We had some problems with the temperature, too hot too cold back and forth all night. I’m sure if we reached out to the hosts they would have been responsive and helped us figure it out. Overall, it was a great experience. All the details are so well done."

A truly magical and comfy place to relax and hang out with my sister. The design and decoration is incredibly well thought out--so many extra tiny details that add to the fun. And the slide! We went down it so many times, just for fun. Faster than most of the playground slides I slid down growing up. We had a little difficulty finding it, but we were driving in the dark so that didn't help. Directions were helpful, but I could've used a little more help in finding our house after turning onto the treehouse-named road (the provided directions give the actual road name, I'm being vague to protect their privacy). But overall it was an amazing spot and we will definitely be back!"

Stayed one night","This was our last stop on our mini tour of Earth & Sky Dwellings and wow were we amazed! When I first researched this place and found out there was a slide I was thinking there would be no way I could go down it. But when we arrived and I actually saw it I knew I HAD to, and oh my gosh it really made me feel like a kid again. You don't get that feeling too often, so this place will always be special to me. The house itself is only one room (besides the bathroom) but it doesn't feel small at all. The tall ceilings and walls covered in fabric really makes it feel like you're in one of the magical tents from the movies. We were in awe of this place. It's truly beautiful here and a magical experience to say the least. From the stunning views to the adorable little tent out back. Don't miss out on this place. We are so very thankful to the hosts for sharing such a wonderful home with us. Hoping to return some day. <3"

They have a few extra cooking appliances available in the cupboard (hot plate, toaster oven) which were a nice addition to the microwave and fridge.
One thing I think is important to know is that during my stay the WiFi was a bit slow. It varied from 2 mbps to 13 mbps and made streaming (Harry Potter movies, of course!) difficult at times. I mostly mention it in case anyone plans to do any Zoom meeting or the like, I would make sure to have an alternate option (hotspot, data) available. Or if you need to download something, perhaps you should do it prior to your Airbnb stay.
Would love to come again! Such an original and fabulous location!"

This was a surprise trip for our 11 year old Harry Potter fanatic and it did not disappoint. All the reviews that mention ""attention to detail"" were spot on. Every detail of this place was perfect and well thought out. Highlights were the slide entry into the home, the invisibility cloak, the sorting hat, the incredible views and all the little Harry Potter details. We were especially pleased to find that all the HP movies were pre-purchased on Amazon Prime so we may or may not have been extraordinarily lazy and just stayed in our magical mountain tent all weekend watching the movies, drinking Butterbeer and eating HP treats. :) This place was so great that there really was no reason to leave and we are so glad we stayed.

We are Harry Potter fans and we were blown away at their attention to detail. The tent was perfect for us and our two young children. The outdoor tent was perfect for games and late night conversations. A welcome basket with snacks and coffee was a nice touch. The real magic was in the giant slide that my kids enjoyed for HOURS. We recommend all potter heads stay here at least once! Thanks for a memorable Christmas.

Sorting hat, robes for each house, themed games, and even a cloak of invisibility! But the most magical part of this place is the view of the mountains while sitting around the fire pit.
We had a wifi issue that the owners quickly responded to and fixed so we could enjoy a movie that night. There’s a grocery store at the bottom of the hill for anything you need. Only 15 minutes to the Biltmore Estate which was amazing. And we found the nearby small town of Weaverville to be so charming and enjoyed their restaurants for a couple of meals. We can’t wait to come back and stay in another one of their amazing properties here."

It was so beautiful and so relaxing. Totally worth it. There is a grocery store and gas station at the base of the mountain, so if you need food, drinks, anything really it is readily available. This is the perfect getaway for a couple or parents with young children (just keep a close eye on the kids when they’re outside - you are on the side of a mountain after all). Fast, reliable Internet available as well as plenty of analog games like connect four and HP themed games, books, etc. Fire pit for s’mores or just warming up. No stove or oven, but microwave is available as well as an electric kettle and coffee maker. Be sure to wake up between 6 and 7 am to see the fog descend the mountain and slowly reveal the surround landscape below."

As a place to stay, they’ve got the whole situation keyed up with all the necessities, including an easy self check in process with a keyless entry around back (the non slide part!). To finally stay in one of their themed homes, however, was a whole different experience. The attention to fun details and the clear overall goal of making the whole thing an experience to remember had me geeking out the whole time. Not the cheapest stay, but when you see all that goes into this and all their stays, you can really appreciate the value. Highly recommend this and all their properties!"
