Group trip","Loved our short stay! Plenty to do at the house to wind-down after long days hiking & ATVing. Comfortable beds & pillows. We loved sitting in the living room in the mornings sipping on some coffee & listening to the birds. The place is right off of an intersection of 2 roads, but we only heard cars a couple of times. Close to Houghton & grocery stores, but far enough away it feels private & secluded."

The location is nice and private and just a short drive to town. The hosts were great and answered any questions very quickly. Would absolutely recommend this home to others and would love to return someday."

Stayed with kids","This house was ideal for a larger family. It worked so well for my daughters MI Tech graduation. We would have needed multiple hotels rooms and this enabled us to also cook our own meals avoiding the craziness of the restaurants graduation weekend. Also, the game room. Hours of entertainment. It rained most of our stay so with the kiddos and young adults the entertainment was so appreciated! Absolutely perfect."

Stayed over a week","We stayed at this location for just under 3 weeks and could not have found a more relaxing or comfortable location. There is tons of space for all the guests and lots to do at the house. We all enjoyed the video games, massage chair, disk golf baskets outside, Hot tub, and even the sauna on the lower level of the house. The whole crew felt right at home and really enjoyed or stay after working 10hr days. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone that needs a lot of space for a family vacation with tons to do or just needing a quiet place to get away. This location is well worth the price."

Group trip","Wow, this place was phenomenal! Visiting from near the Twin Cities it wasn’t too far away. This house is massive with plenty of rooms and beds for you and your family or group of friends to get together. I visited over the new years and it was such a blessing to have this space with so many things to do to bring in the new year. Key elements were definitely the Sauna, The Hottub, the 2 racing arcades and massage chair. We would LOVE to make it a tradition to come back next year here.
Cheers!"

Stayed with kids","Our family group of 6 adults and 3 children loved being here! We could have easily been comfortable with a larger group. This home and property are spacious, comfortable and roomy, providing fabulous options for group activities and individual enjoyment.
The sizable yard contains a hot tub, disc golf course, fire pit for a bonfire, and patio areas with lots of seating.
Inside the home on the lower level are arcade quality games, a big TV to watch a game or movie together, and a sauna!
The main level offers a beautifully furnished living area with lovely views, dining area, a large kitchen, and master suite. There is a large well equipped laundry room too!
Over the attached garage is a good sized room with three queen sized beds. Inside the house, upstairs are three different sleeping areas.
We were also pleased with our hosts who were excellent in every way! A great experience."

The thing that really stood out was all the “little things” that were thought of throughout the property. Highlight was being able to star gaze at night in a perfectly dark back yard and see more stars than we could ever hope to. Will definitely look forward to staying here again the next time we come UP North."

Stayed with kids","A beautiful house located amidst the lakes worth the stay.
The house looks exactly like the pictures shown. The game room was an instant hit with the kids as well as adults. The bath tub was great and even sauna too. Had plenty of Utensils to cook and lots of things to do nearby. We stayed for four days but felt that was not enough. Overall we had a great time and will surely recommend this place if you are a big family or going in with friends.
Note: the maps shows the address on the opp side as in if it’s says left then the house is actually right"

Group trip",Kari's home was amazing. We were up for the graduation of our MTU grad. Drive was 10 minutes to campus. The games in the basement kept the high schoolers with us busy. Thank you of having plenty of towels fire the shorts and hot tub. There was 9 off is and everyone's had plenty of space and a bed. It rained the whole weekend so we didn't get too enjoy the beautiful yard. If we return to the Keweenaw we hope this home is available. Thank you Kari and Daniel!

It fit our needs perfectly, tons of room for parking both trucks with twenty foot trailers. Property is huge and private, very peaceful. The house has a unique layout, but it worked perfect for our group. Very clean and well stocked kitchen. Only complaint was the previous guests used all the firewood for the fireplace!

Riding south would be much better.

I could tell care was taken in the selection of everything. The furnishings were very comfortable and the kitchen has everything someone would need. The cabin also had very good literature detailing the surrounding area and the host's personal recommendations.
The location is within 5-10 minutes of downtown Houghton making it a great choice if you're planning on exploring Keweenaw Peninsula and surrounding Lake Superior coastline, which is what we did.
I would recommend staying here to anyone and if I returned to the area I would love to stay again."

Our only regret is that we couldn't have stayed an additional day or two. JoLynn was a great host and we were even able to access the unit a couple hours before the official check in time."

Small cottage, perfect for a family of 4 adults. JoLynn responded quickly and decorated the cottage well.

Cabin #1 is closest to the road, and you will hear drivers running over the rumble strips and general road noise. We were so tired from our road trips all over, we didn't have trouble sleeping.

Stayed a few nights","We had an A+ experience at JoLynne's cabin! We were lucky to have a two night stay here in July 2020 and used the cabin as our home base to explore the Keweenaw Peninsula. The location was perfect for us. There was a golf course next door and a lovely shaded trail across the road for running/walking/biking. We were close to town but the property was so quiet and private. Even though there are three other cabins here we didn't see any other guests. JoLynn has great style and her cabin is decorated beautifully. We had so much space for the three of us and it was sparkling clean. There were so many nice little touches - extra hand sanitizer and wipes, popcorn and coffee, mints on top of our towels that were displayed nicely on the beds. The master bedroom mattress was very comfortable and the duvet was nicer than mine at home. We were all sad when our time at the cottage came to an end. JoLynn is a very considerate host and responds to questions and concerns very quickly. I would recommend her cottages highly and hope to stay here again soon!"

JoLynn was easy to communicate with and so sweet about checking in to see if we needed anything. If you're planning a trip to Houghton, I'd absolutely recommend staying in one of JoLynn's cabins."

Stayed with kids","For the last 6-7 years my family (wife, 12 year old, 9 year old, and myself) have been coming up for a long weekend/New Years getaway. This is by far our favorite spot we have stayed in. Walking distance to all of our favorites (KBC, Joey's, Suomi, and shops) with the added bonus of having a view of the bridge. We loved it.
The apartment itself is great. Nicely decorated, big bathroom, very nice kitchen, and a living room big enough for the 4 of us. The only downside, if there was one, was that the bedrooms are a little small and there are only two beds. Not a problem since the 12 year old opted for the couch, but something to consider if traveling with kids. I was a little worried about the apartment being loud since it is right off the main street, but with the bedrooms on the back side it wasn't an issue at all. Wife and daughter loved the boutique downstairs too."

Stayed about a week","We were a group of competitive skiers staying in Houghton for the US National Cross Country Ski Championships. We actually rented both Unit B and C which are right next door and this allowed for a really unique shared but also private experience. The units are incredible. A beautiful urban revitalization project of a historic downtown building. As an architect, I really appreciated the work that went into the quality finishes and amenities of the space.
The location is perfect. Close to everything for us. 5 mins from the ski trails. Walkable to restaurants, shops, and entertainment. And ample parking! A rarity for a downtown location. It's fun to watch the snow fall outside the big storefront windows.
You couldn't ask for a better airbnb! I sincerely hope we have an excuse to come back and stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in town to tour MI Tech and picked this Airbnb in large part due to it’s proximity to campus.
It was close and convenient but not really walking distance given the large hill up from campus into the surrounding residential area.
The couches and blankets were both super comfy and cozy. The scenery out the window in the upper room was lovely. The bedroom is large.
The sauna was a neat perk and the whole place was very clean and well supplied with the basics.
You will definitely hear the kiddos when they are home.
We did have a bit of trouble staying connected to the WiFi.
The spiral staircase being the only way to access the main part (bathroom/bedroom/kitchen) is a bit inconvenient when hauling bags but is a bit of fun and not unmanageable by any means.
And the rest of the place made up for it.
Would definitely recommend it to friends and/or go back again."

Stayed over a week","This is a cozy basement apartment, with an upstairs entry / sitting area, located on the edge of Houghton near ski and forest trails, and within close range of the university. Amenities are set-up especially well for weekend travellers, but Alan is open to longer-term stays and very amenable to helping facilitate them, such as I experienced. With space for an automobile, the location can be used by airbnb stays that are more ""drop-in"" while touring around the area, but it is also completely possible to use it more as a temporary residence, as well as to get along without a car, so long as one can walk up and down the steeper topography of the Houghton area.
Probably you will find it fun to order some take-out food for some of the evenings, but the kitchen is fully equipped with a full fridge and freezer, eating ware, and the basics for simple cooking upon a plug-in induction stove. Fancy meals are not recommended, but why cook like that when away from home, anyway?
The decorations are ""homey,"" ""northwoods,"" and representative of local artists. The space is very large, with sufficient room for a couple people to stay in a fold-down bed in the living room space with separation from another two people possible to share the bedroom area. Bring slippers as it is a basement, but rugs keep the feet warm, too. Smile as you hear the cat running along the ceiling and the laughter of a few kids, and feel yourself welcomed to Houghton, it's family-friendly atmosphere, and the close surroundings of the forests."

We did experience some unexpected noise from the family in the early hours of the morning, which didn’t allow us to get the greatest sleep. The apartment is connected to the host house, so keep this in mind when booking. Overall, good experience and served its purpose for a great snowmobiling weekend."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I booked Alan's place the day before we took a motorcycle trip to visit to the Keweenaw. (We kinda had to do it last second since we had to understand what the weather would be like.) Anyways, Alan very graciously accommodated our late request and the home was positioned PERFECTLY for us to jump off to Copper Harbor, Calumet, and everywhere else. I can't recommend this location enough if you're looking to establish a ""base camp"" for a Copper Country visit. Houghton itself is a fabulous town with some pretty good eats going on - I am from Esky originally but have since become pretty ""city-fied"" down in Chicago, so I'm all picky and junk when it comes to food, and these places stand up to city-level fare. Note that Houghton is HILLY so bring your legs. Wait, I should be reviewing the accommodations not the town... suffice it to say Alan's place was perfect. There was privacy and all the amenities we needed (and a SAUNA, which made every Swedish cell in my body leap with joy) and a real comfortable ""homey"" feeling about the place. The whole set up is quite clever and thoughtful. If we head back up that way again we will most certainly look Alan's abode up."

Talia was easy to contact and very helpful from the start! the only thing i would note is that the fire detectors are sensitive (we learned the hard way while cooking :p) so maybe open a window just in case! i loved how extra towels, sheets, and pillows were provided. also want to add the shower is amazing!! some airbnbs lack in that area so wanted to shout it out. cute decor and vibe for entire apartment. great place to come back and relax at after being out all day :) would definitely come back!!"

Talia was a gracious host, and this cozy, contemporary space was perfect for a single occupant in town for work. Very thoughtfully finished throughout with all-modern appliances. Wireless that was faster than my work-at-home office. Parking right outside. The Houghton Waterfront Trail is practically right outside the door and downtown and the Shelden Ave. Historic District is one block uphill. Enough food choices for an extended stay. I'm involved in urban planning and design, and this was a great point from which to explore everything that Houghton and MTU have done or are doing to transform the town.
The hosts have done a great job finishing the interior of this converted space and I couldn't have been happier with my stay. Will be looking to return if we have more work in the area (and even if we don't!)."

This wasn’t desirable but out of the hosts hands. The host did refund some money for the inconvenience. Only complaint we had was the sleeper couch in the living room was extremely uncomfortable.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed for 2 nights. The rental was perfect for just us. The décor of the rental is great, and I took some of the ideas back home with me. You can walk to all of the restaurants and/or shops on your side of the canal. If you don't mind a longer walk, then you can also walk to all the restaurants and/or shops on the other side of the canal as well.
It would be an excellent stay for visiting the University, Canals, or Copper Harbor."

Stayed a few nights","The location is amazing but I will say the photo in the listing is a little misleading. The unit is completely under a parking garage so you have to walk 250-500 feet or so until you actually get to the riverfront walkway. You can’t access it directly from in front of the rental unit. The place was impeccably clean and the host was super responsive. There was garage construction going on in the parking garage and so she gave us a discount on the stay for the inconvenience. Highly recommend this space if you’re looking to be right in downtown Houghton near everything. Due to the fact that the space is in a parking garage, the views from the two windows in the space is not great, but again, we booked it for the location and it didn’t disappoint! Highly recommend!"

The apartment is so cozy, well decorated and charm, that invites to enjoy time there and in town. By far this apartment shines above a other listings we have seen in the area.
From her place the visits to Copper Harbor, Keweenaw Peninsula and the Porcupine Mountines are a short drive, and makes Her apartment a perfect central location.
We were also lucky to enjoy fall season (just slightly pass peak) and drive through some of the best scenic routes we have seen in Michigan.
Love Talia’s place and how easy all the process was to get in and out."

We were up here for a 40th-year class reunion at MTU and when compared to the room at the Vault Hotel where our friends stayed we felt this was a much better choice. One suggestion for improving the apt would be to add a foldup luggage rack or dresser to the closet or bedroom area."

Stroll down the walkway along the Pilgrim River to grab a sweet or pasty at Roy’s and sit at one of the many picnic tables to enjoy.

The kitchen had everything needed to prepare a meal and there was a nice variety of spice and seasonings available. The bed was very comfortable. It is nothing fancy but had the perfect look for a UP cabin. The individual room radiators worked perfectly to keep the cabin warm. There are some books and toys available to entertain yourself. I imagine the view in the summer would be great next to the golf course. We had neighbors during our stay but did not hear a sound. The cabins are spaced for privacy. I would be happy to stay there again.

Stayed with kids","Our Airbnb experience with Irina and her rental was a great experience. The home met our needs for our stay, Irina was incredibly responsive, the location was a quick drive to downtown, the surroundings had lush wildflowers, deers, and other wildlife. The home is new construction, so everything was in great shape. The furniture was comfortable, and we felt home. I absolutely recommend staying here."

Stayed over a week","This Airbnb is so clean and setup to walk into and stay for as long or as short as you want. I stayed from January 2, 2023 until April 26, 2023. The only thing I asked for was a ring doorbell. This was for me, due to me being alone for me to feel safe if someone came to the door: just in case you’re wondering why there is one (place very safe no one came). The point is they did whatever I needed with me being alone: needed or not. I plan on coming back next month for a couple of weeks. I will only stay here from now on as you cannot beat the hospitality."

This house had everything we needed for a great vacation place to come home too. Rooms are spacious and clean, nice comfortable queen-size beds, nicely stocked kitchen, washer and dryer, close to restaurants, gas and groceries. And price per night was great. Highly recommend this three bedroom home!"

That was not a problem in terms of temperature but we slept with the windows open to get a breeze. So noise on the street is easily heard. I was awakened one morning before 6:00 by motorcycles headed up the road.

Stayed a few nights","The place was as described and nicely decorated. The couch was comfy. The beds were only ok. Angela was easy to work with and communicated early with details. She was very friendly throughout. The parking was close to the unit and the first floor was very convenient.
The place ended up being challenging for us, we think because it didn’t have air circulation so it felt stuffy and flared allergy symptoms. Because of that I won’t be able to use this place again even though it was spacious and cute. Also, there were no recycling bins and we like to recycle. The walls were pretty thin in the building. I could hear the neighbors talking and their phone vibrating on their table from my bedroom- so not a private place."

Stayed a few nights","Clean, modest, lower-floor apartment. Comfy bed, and super-comfy couch. Host was very accommodating when I asked if I could check out late (plane wasn't leaving till 7pm).
A bit hard to get around without wheels. There's a small grocery store a little ways away that's walkable. The town is just down the hill. (Pro-tip: save your morning shower until you walk back up the hill to the apartment. Then you'll want the shower!).
Kitchen had almost no condiments etc, so bring all your food in. Needed more creamers supplied, and better quality coffee (better than Dunkin Donuts).
Sometimes loud vehicles drive up the hill next to the apartment, but that wasn't a problem. When the upstairs neighbor is home and walking around, it's stompy and loud, and sounds like they're in the apartment with you. But they don't stay up late or anything, or play music.
Comfy place. Host was pretty responsive."

It was well stocked with paper products, coffee, soap, shampoo, detergent etc. Added bonus was the 6-pack of local beer that was much appreciated. Highly recommended."

We had what we needed for the meals we made at the house. my only suggestion is that maybe the bathroom wash clothes need to be bleached. They were a bit dingy and had some stains. Nothing major.

Stayed with kids","Our stay At the Accent House at Beach View, was, as Mary Poppins would say.. ""Practically Perfect in Every Way"". The house was clean and bright, the layout of the house was very conducive to having children and/or more than one family. The master bedroom had it's own bathroom as well as a great closet area that included a Pack-and-Play 'room' that could easily be made dark and quiet for an infant to sleep well. The other two bedrooms had roomy dressers and closets with an ample number of hangers and shared the other bathroom. The kitchen was well stocked with tableware, cooking pans and useful appliances. Laundry facilities too! The location was awesome! Walking distance to the Hancock Beach for swimming, picnics, swings, playgrounds and paddleboarding or kayaking! All this AND a secure garage, which is wonderful if you bring paddleboards, bikes or other 'toys' that you want secured overnight. If we ran out of anything, our hosts were very responsive in making sure we got a supply quickly. If we had questions about anything, they were also very quick in getting back to us to let us know the information we needed. All in all, this was an amazing place to stay. Very highly recommend."

Group trip",It’s perfect. Canal view new construction. The host has everything that you can expect in an airbnb. We stayed cause we visited Michigan Tech and that’s 5min away. The bridge doesn’t have tolls. Highly recommend staying here over even hotels in the area. You even have a covered oversized car garage.

Stay here if you want peace & comfort in the beautiful UP. We’d love to stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","We had the best time at Jenn & Jason’s! The studio we stayed in felt like it was our own home, it was so comfortable and had everything we needed. (I had to work a bit and the internet was perfect.)
Their property is so beautiful & peaceful. Each morning we stopped at their little farm stand for fresh coffee (roasted on site!) & the BEST homemade cinnamon rolls. We then walked around the farm saying good morning to each of their animals with our pup- who also loved it. Then we would bring him to run in their gated dog run area. It was a dream. And their farm stand is my favorite feature of any air bnb. :)
Most importantly, Jenn & Jason are amazing hosts and have created the most thoughtful and welcoming space for visitors to experience. Jason even gave us a coffee roasting class which was the best! Our time with them was as special as the rest of our experience.
We didn’t want to leave!
PS- take a look at Jenn’s local guide book for great suggestions on what to do in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","I will keep this review short. My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to escape for the weekend and we came across this airbnb located perfectly between open land and city. Upon driving into the driveway you are greeted with chickens and to the left by the little cabin you have sheep. The land is very spacious, you have dedicated parking and the entrance is on the opposite end of the shared home. Jen is very friendly, responsive, and very welcoming. They have a small store front where you can buy small essential things for grilling along with coffee, drinks, snacks and every morning free cinnamon buns for guest which we appreciated. The cabin is very cozy and is a mix between old and updated which gives off a homey vibe. The room was clean and has nice decor. They offer kayaks for 20$ a person and the drive to the river is 2 minutes which was an amazing experience. Overall it was a nice experience and will recommend to couples for an escape."

Homemade cinnamon rolls available every day was a special treat. Wifi was excellent, bed was very very comfortable. Fewer bugs than we anticipated in the area overall. They’re also near a great beach with a lighthouse. Perfect for 2 people (and a dog). Would love to stay again!"

This is not a place to do any cooking - the kitchenette is very basic. the cherries were ripe and the hosts left a note letting me know I could use the stepladder they left out to pick some - a delicious treat!

Stayed a few nights","Granny's Place is a fun and unique place to stay on your visit to Keweenaw and Lake Superior. Jenn and Jason are friendly hosts who are willing to chat with you, if you chose, but also who give you space and privacy, if that is your preference. The apartment is a comfortable space to stay on a hobby farm with sheep, chickens, turkeys, and ducks who we had fun feeding a snack of corn provided by our hosts. Our visit occurred in late June 2022 when the weather was very mild and wildflowers were in bloom and abundant.
The apartment is attached to the back of the hosts' house with its own separate entrance in the side yard. We used it simply as a place to stay at night. It provides amenities similar to a hotel mini-suite with a bathroom with stand-up shower, comfortable bed in the sleeping area, and small ""living room/kitchen"" with a sofa, chair, and small TV connected to an internet type content provider. The kitchen area has a sink, mini-fridge, microwave and hot plate provided. This mini-kitchen is convenient for preparing simple meals or snacks, but would not be appropriate for baking or cooking a big meal.
Located about 8 miles north of Houghton on Canal Road, this sweet and rustic retreat is off the beaten path, a short distance from a small county/township owned beach on Lake Superior, and was a place that my wife and I really enjoyed on our four day vacation exploring the Keweenaw Peninsula.
We used Granny's Place as our base camp, while we explored the small towns and villages of the area, toured the Eagle Harbor lighthouse (a wonderfully scenic and historic place to visit), walked Michigan Tech's campus and visited its outstanding mineral museum, studied the history of copper mining in the area, and enjoyed the vistas of waterfalls, tall trees, and many miles of inspiring Lake Superior shoreline.
The area is a great place to visit for people who like love nature's beauty in an uncrowded setting while having the amenities of a college town near by. Having Jenn and Jason as our hosts at their rustic, comfortable, and unique place was the icing on the cake."

The space was very clean & the furniture was comfortable. We didn’t see much of the grounds, as we arrived at night, during late December, and had to hit the road early to outpace the brunt of a winter storm; but what we saw was very nice- it’s a lovely hobby farm, worth checking out.
The hosts were very responsive to our questions and were very accommodating."

Stayed one night","jenn and jason were amazing hosts. they had thorough and easy communication. if you enjoy the countryside, this is where you need to be. it reminded me of home away from home. they are located just far enough outside of houghton and just close enough to it too for exploration, relaxation, and a place to rest your head.
our only qualm was the sheer curtains. though it provides a sense of privacy, it was not enough for us for the daytime and nighttime. understandably they are in a more secluded area; however, in spite of that, we wished we had more coverage for privacy."

Appreciate the great communication provided by hosts on directions and contactless check-in. One of the highlights of the stay was being able to interact and feed the sheep just outside our doorstep when we wake up in the morning, they are so gentle and friendly. Would love to stay again when there is the opportunity!"

Otherwise, it is close to a nice beach and the animals are friendly. Recommend for a cozy getaway."

Stayed one night","Looking for a taste of a tiny home in the Upper Peninsula’s Copper Country? This is it. Owners have transformed a back porch into a simple, cozy and tasteful living space just a few miles away from downtown Houghton, Michigan Tech, Keweenaw National Historical Park, Suomi Restaurant (try the Finnish Pannu kakku, a mix of an oven-baked pancake and flan) and other spots in this historic area. It’s also near the Houghton Shipping Canal. Very quiet. Feed the ducks, chickens and sheep. If you have Verizon you may have internet here, otherwise you may not. So download a book like we did or movie, etc., or simply disconnect after visiting the sites nearby, or driving up to Copper Harbor, always a treat, especially in fall when U.S. 41 turns into a tunnel of spectacular colorful leaves."

Stayed a few nights","Adam was very helpful and flexible with our hurried graduation schedule allowing an earlier check in. It was smaller than expected to the point of being cramped. Basically, this is a room off of the garage that has a basement feel to it. They were out of town but the dogs were upstairs and frequently barked for extended periods late at night. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. Parking was a perk if you don’t have a truck. You are required to park in the garage which is nice but very tight fit for a truck. The entrance from the garage did not lock which was fine because you could shut the overhead door but was still not comforting."

The shower didn’t always run a consistent temperature sometimes would give you cold spells in the hot :p & the driveway to get in is at a slightly weird angle, but that’s how a lot of them are in the steeper hills of the U.P. :) Nice stay would recommend to others."

You may also hear the hot water heater running, as it is in the kitchenette area. Although, Adam was very clear that he and his family live in the space above.

It does have some nice little touches to make the stay more comfortable. USB ports on both night stands, provided coffee, and condiments in the refrigerator. There is a kitchen to cook if you would like too. The bedroom and kitchen have windows, so there is natural light. TV and sitting area are between the bedroom and kitchen. It is about 3/4 of a mile to walk to the historic downtown area, and only the first few blocks are down/up, going/coming from town, the rest is flat. Great place to base camp, and explore the Keweenaw Peninsula."
