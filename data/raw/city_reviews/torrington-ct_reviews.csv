Stayed one night","Came here with a group of friends and did some touring around the area. Perfect location so easy to get to the CT wine trail, Litchfield distillery and hiking on Sunday after the hangover. The house was great for our large group- we even rented hibachi one night the host approved it for an extra fee! Awesome spot for events."

Group trip","Staying at this farm stay was such a wonderful experience! It was the perfect place for our little family to get out of the city for a peaceful weekend away! The property itself is breathtaking. Our son loved watching the horses and we enjoyed a morning cup of coffee to the sounds of the creek! There is lots to do in the area, but honestly our time on the farm was the best part of our stay! Rachel was a lovely and accommodating host. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and hope to go back again ourselves!"

Short walk to an up and coming revitalization of downtown, with lots of interesting shops and restaurants. This was a perfect place to stay while visiting my daughter at boarding school.

Having a designated private parking space off the street is a plus. The place is clean, quiet, and conveniently located. Entry instructions were clear and Molly was responsive to all communications. I'll add this location to my favorites list for future stays."

Stayed with a pet","I was born and raised in Torrington and remember when this property was a greenhouse. I was quite surprised to find it renovated so beautifully. The apartment we stayed in was perfect! Private setting, quiet, comfortable, clean and every amenity that you could need was available. Comfortable bed and lots of extra blankets. The kitchen was stocked with everything you’d need to cook meals. The bathroom has plenty of towels and toiletries available. All the little homey touches throughout was very appreciated. The backyard is gorgeous and shockingly large for the neighborhood and even has a pond,. I’d love to see it in the summer time. Every little detail has been thoughtfully thought out including signage for parking, lighting on walk paths and a bistro set on the balcony with a vase and fairy lights. I will definitely be recommending this property to everyone and plan to return on my next visit! Well done to the owners and thank you for such a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Molly and Victor were able to accommodate a late reservation so I could spend some time with my mom nearby. Communication was clear and responsive from the get-go. Instructions for check-in and where to park were sent the day before as promised. Everything fresh, clean, and neat as a pin. Appreciated the option to park in the garage. Wish I'd had more time to hang out on the porch or explore the backyard. Received apologies that the a/c had been taken out for the season (who expected temps in the 80s in October??), but there were two ceiling fans plus a floor fan and I was able to make it comfortable with those. Didn't do any cooking, but looked like most of the basics were there for putting together a meal. Coffee and tea were available, as were a shelf of assorted books and suggestions for things to do in the area. Walkways and hallways were well lit. A little bit of road noise but not intrusive. Would definitely stay here again!"

Both beds - queen bed and pull out sofa - were very comfortable with a good a/c and television too. Large tiled kitchen was well equipped and the sliding door with screen door onto our own private porch was a really nice plus . We spent time checking out the garden including a large koi pond with fountains, stone benches, a lawn, plantings, mature trees. There is a good vegan restaurant nearby and we also liked the Nutmeg Grill for breakfast."

About the yard-it's a park. It's huge and peaceful and gorgeous and lush and words don't do it justice. But the apartment itself was just as fabulous. Clean, restful, comfortable with plenty of space. Anytime I am ever back in the area I will definitely book with them."

Everything was spotless, and the apartment was well appointed with everything you could need, including a private balcony to eat breakfast. This place is a beautiful oasis that we did not expect to find on Main Street, Torrington. Also, a laundromat and Walgreens were a short walk away, and there’s even a Dairy Queen nearby.

Stayed with kids","Molly's place was the perfect ""home base"" for our weekend in Torrington! Clean, comfy, quiet place to sleep and super close to the Nutmeg Ballet where we spent most of our time. There are three units in the house, but other than crossing paths in the yard a few times, we never heard or saw anyone and felt like we had the place to ourselves. My 9 and 5yr old boys LOVED exploring in the spacious and beautiful backyard. They especially loved getting to glimpses of the koi fish in the pond. We travel to Torrington several times a year and look forward to staying at Molly's place in the future!"

Molly was easy to communicate with and checking in and out was seamless. We would definitely recommend this place!"

It truly feels like you’re not just another person renting an apartment from her.

Stayed with kids","My family and I really enjoyed staying at Molly's. There was enough room for two adults and two kids, one being a baby. We loved the kids museum close by, the huge garden behind the home, the actual home, and the amenities... and our son especially loved the games provided. The stay was like a mini-vacation for us - it was really great and we loved everything about it. I enjoyed waking up to the sun streaming through the windows into the kitchen, we barely had to bring anything extra except for food (meat, veggies, carbs, etc) because the kitchen was pretty much fully stocked with essentials, and we were so close to restaurants and grocery stores if there was anything else we needed. The bed was also super comfortable; even our 3-year-old was raving about how comfortable the bed was. He's already ready to return to ""the home with the green door."" We hope to be able to come back to stay again because it was a lovely vacation in what felt like a home away from home! :)"

Stayed a few nights","Molly and Victor are very lovely Host. The place is as described with a few extras I really liked. We stay in lots of Airbnb's and Molly and Victor's place was nicely stocked with coffee, sugar, spices, and everything you need to get started on your night's stay. It's located right on a Main Street, but it was very quiet and great off street parking. We liked the heated towel rack and extra heat in the bathroom that you can turn on. It was also very clean and you have everything you need. We had one issue with Roku and within minutes Molly and Victor responded and had us up and working. Lots of close coffee houses and restaurants. We would stay again! Thank you Molly and Victor!"

Stayed with kids","Molly & Victor were responsive and helpful in advance and during our stay. The space was nicely setup with adequate amenities. It was actually larger than I understood, which was great for our family of four. It’s located on a busy street in a small city, but we felt comfortable. It’s an easy 10-minute walk to downtown where there’s an historical theatre, a few restaurants, a cool used book store and even a fabulous art gallery space run by a non-profit. In the other direction on Main Street there are a handful of Latin American grocers and shops. The garden on this property was a hidden gem, with a coy-fish pond and a river running past the very back."

Stayed a few nights","Molly and Victor's place was great. It had everything I needed for my stay. Their communication was outstanding too. Check in was super easy and their little apartment was perfect, and just so happened to be 3 minutes to restaurants, shops and my sister's new home! The home is close enough to Waterbury that I went there several times during my stay. The apartment was very quiet despite it being on Main St and I never heard the traffic. The people in the other apartments were quiet which made my stay very relaxing. Molley and Victor's place had internet and all the amenities I needed to cook. The only thing that was a little less than perfect was being able to take a hot bath, as the hot water ran out before the tub was filled. Definitely not a deal breaker but thought I'd note it just in case their are others who enjoy a relaxing hot bath like I do. The yard is incredibly beautiful and unexpected. I got to see it covered in snow and free from snow during my stay and it was beautiful either way! Overall, the place was lovely and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at in Connecticut.
Thank you Molly and Victor!!!!! You two are the epitome of a great Airbnb experience!"

The price was better than the local dumpy motel (and closer and nicer). The bed was super soft. Where I stayed had a little seating area because I had guest visit me. Certain seasons they have berry picking (blueberries and raspberries). Dairy queen and a Chinese food place is close. If you pull in the gravel driveway I would do a K turn to get out it's not impossible but interesting especially because I have rear wheel drive. Watch your step going up the back paver stairs go slow... It had everything all I had to do was come in and put my stuff away...I would definitely stay here again.

The living space was clean and had everything that I needed plus being located in the downtown area I wasn't far from stores and amenities to go grocery shopping and pick up essentials for the week. I was able to get my work done and then go outside and enjoy the beautiful garden and koi pond. I loved stepping out into the garden each day for a session of yoga and meditation. The experience was like going on my own private mini retreat!! It was exactly what I needed as a personal reset to spend some time away from the city and enjoy fresh air and positive vibes.

Stayed a few nights","What mainly drew us to this home was the outdoor sitting area, as well as the overall clean/relaxing vibes we got from the photos. Unfortunately, the outdoor space was not available at the time of our booking due to the season.
While the home is just as beautiful in person as it is in photos, our experience fell short of expectations. We were seriously terrified when we came across multiple doors we did not know about, such as the unlocked trap door in the kitchen and the two separate doors that lead to the garage, both have deadbolts and unlock with the keys provided. The host assured us no one else had access and we were safe, however we still felt uneasy knowing anyone in the garage could easily access our side of the home.The bedroom was very hot, we turned down the temp on both thermostats and it stayed just as hot. Contacted the host the next morning about it and she got back to us the following morning, 4 hours before checkout. We did not sleep well at all. Disappointed."

Although the location was near to ""downtown"", it was more a drive-able location than walk-able, unless you are a regular hiker. Quiet neighborhood, nice landscaping around the house, and a private ""in-law"" type setup. This is a much better solution in the Torrington area than any of the motels/hotels."

It’s a bit of a landlord special, doors and drawers unable to close, the ceiling is lifting, no caulk in tub. The living room though is absolutely gorgeous!!! Direct sunlight and super clean. Everything was super smooth and really did the job as a place to sleep for the night. Would recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","WOW. This was the best Airbnb I have EVER stayed at. I was looking for a place that had a FULL KITCHEN and that is HARD to find on Airbnb. I wanted to be able to cook on the stove, and use a full kitchen to make breakfast and dinner if I wanted too, use the dishwasher, use the sink. I also wanted to be able to use a WASHER and DRYER. This place has it all! It's a remodeled section of a home with a private entrance on the other side of the garage from the main house. we had a spot in the driveway off the street to park right by the door to our section. We got there and there was a lockbox with a key in it. I was staying there for Christmas and the house had Christmas lights up which was a nice touch! I never heard any noise from the main section of the house. It snowed the first night , and we went outside the next day to find the driveway shoveled and two ice scrapers next to the door for us to use. Communication was always prompt and helpful with everything! The bathroom had a really nice hair dryer, the bedroom had an iron and ironing board, and bed was SUPER comfortable! The space had two TVs and Netflix to watch on both of them! TWO thermostats for the living room and the kitchen/bedroom areas. There was soap, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers in the shower! the kitchen sink had hand soap and dish soap dispensers, a coffee maker, a full canister of coffee grounds, sweetener, a couple of snacks, and even purified water in the fridge which was perfect for my CPAP! The town of Torrington is a very safe and cozy small town, not far from some towns that inspired Gilmore girls. There is a quaint movie theatre only 1 mile away - with reclining seats, and some nice diners and burger joints nearby. My standards will be really high after staying here, everything was above and beyond! I couldn't be any happier! Thanks for everything!"

The place is historic and has a lot of character and charm. Kitchenette and bathroom all fully updated and modern. It is also easily walkable to all Litchfield Green shops and restaurants. Easy and ample parking; easy check-in and check-out. Scott was a very responsive host who made himself available for questions and recommendations. He was flexible for an early check-in. Definitely take a moment to understand the floor plan/ layout (which is explained accurately in the description). The kitchenette, for example, is in one of the bedrooms. This could pose a problem for some travelers. It did not for us, but worth a mention!"

Scott was a wonderful host and very accommodating and responsive to our requests and needs during our stay, even when we needed to add a guest and check in a bit early. The Doctor’s House sits across the street from the Litchfield Green within a short walking distance to restaurants and shops. It has a very convenient location. The grounds are lovely and we made very good use of the patio in the back which offers a private place to sit among flowering shrubs, gardens and trees - it was a perfect place to enjoy lunch with other family members who were passing through on their way to the wedding.
All in all it was a lovely stay."

Stayed with kids","The Doctor’s House was very charming! We love staying in AirBnbs that have character and add to the vacation experience which this historic house certainly did.
The landscaping was full of gorgeous flowers and the house was thoughtfully decorated with high quality furniture. The linens and the towels were all brand new and super soft. We all slept very well!
Our host Hal was so responsive and thoughtful - he even purchased a pack and play and a high chair for our visit which was a huge help while traveling with a baby and a toddler.
This was an ideal location in the very center of town. We were able to walk to coffee, restaurants and cute shops. And it felt very central to our driving trips as well.
Highly recommend and we’ll be back!"

Group trip","Fantastic weekend stay! Easy check-in and very responsive hosts, even helped look into local bakeries for us. Ample parking, and unless you're not used to it or have incredibly sensitive hearing, the house does a fantastic job of blocking out the sound of all traffic. Coffee truck steps away from the house was a major plus.
Only reason we couldn't give a full 5 stars is the beds weren't all that comfortable (we all fell asleep fine) but a couple of us did have to use extra blankets to help pad the bed and still woke up with springs digging. We also wished there was a light over the dining room table for board games.
All and all we'd happily rebook this again if we're in the area!"

It was clean and very well appointed. The beds were comfortable and we slept well. The road outside is busy, but the bedrooms are in the back of the house so it was of no consequence, and the gas station next door was actually quite convenient for snacks and drinks. The house included helpful amenities like shampoo, a hair dryer, and body wash. The decor was cute and thoughtful. My kids loved the mini arcade. Our hosts were responsive and friendly. We would stay here again."

Ryan was immediately responsive when we contacted him to ask whether there was an iron we could use. He provided an iron within a couple of hours.

Ryan and Razina did a wonderful job furnishing and updating the house in a smart way that was a perfect fit for our visiting family (and were adding a fence around the property that will be a great addition for the backyard!). Our 5 year old enjoyed trying to finish the puzzles, our dog appreciated the quieter side streets for walks, and we appreciated having nice spaces to get work done while we were staying.
The house is located on a main street close to businesses, but noise from the road was minimal and it made the house a convenient location for getting around the area. It was wonderful being right next to Batchy Brew - the coffee food truck next door.
Ryan and Razina actively communicated any necessary information during the stay - and we enjoyed our time!"

It accommodated my family of 5 plus we had a couple of friends stop by for a couple of hours with plenty of space to entertain all of us.
The queen bed was comfortable, everyone slept well. The entire home was very clean including towels and bedding. We loved walking over to get freshly made lattes, cortados, and hot chocolate (something for everyone in our family). It was really special for me to see visionaries doing something locally and being able to experience it. Thank you, R&R for making my old hometown a better place with the beauty of your unique creativity and vision. We enjoyed staying at your place and love what you are doing!"

When we checked in the key was exactly where the said. we were greeted by an amazing space with an info book ready with all details like the internet code attractions and places to eat including the menus. The beds were comfy the kitchen had everything with a washer and dryer. The host had a coffee truck outside and I loved that there was some action cause Im from the city. On the first day Ryan gave me and my friend coffee on the house!!!!! Even tho they were in the coffee truck they never seemed like they were bothering us SO I LOVED IT! I loved that they had games and a mini gym. I loved this place and will def book again. RYAN AND RAZINA ARE THE BEST! They have the best house and its literally close to everything

The couch reclines and she had plenty of blankets in easy reach. The electric fireplace was a really nice touch! It was cold & snowing outside. There is a great little mud room so we didn’t track snow into the house. Also I’d like to add there is a washer and dryer. We didn’t know this before going but it was a wonderful surprise to dry my kids wet snow play clothes! She left us a bunch of items in case we forgot something ie toothbrush, shampoo, deodorant and mouth wash to name a few. Also laundry detergent to wash clothes. The beds were very comfortable and we really liked the ceiling fans in the bedrooms. In the kitchen we had many items available to us. There was a big selection for cooking, seasonings and even an air fryer. Outside there is plenty of yard for kids to play and it was nice to use the garage for our rental car!"

The house manual covered everything we needed to know. Whenever I reached out to Melissa, she responded nearly immediately.
There were a lot of little touches that made our stay perfect — the chair’s all had cushions, plenty of towels available, cute treats placed on the dining table with thought, nice water pressure, a bench near the front door, a light and camera pointed at our car that made us feel extra secure, wind chimes, ice in the freezer, no clutter, kitchen with all the tools needed, lots of coffee options, lots of books, plenty of lights.. I could go on!!
We didn’t get to meet face to face; however, her care, support, and dedication were all immensely felt nonetheless. Thank you again, Melissa, for such a stellar experience!!"

Well supplied both by John and previous guests. Nice area to drive around. The Saltwater Grille in Litchfield was excellent. Also, check out Espresso 59 in Litchfield. Not only pastries and caffeine. Also, really good soups and pot pies which we took out for quick, inexpensive meals. DIdn't meet John in person (no need), yet he was very friendly and responsive in the couple of phone calls we made to ask questions.
THere were just two of us, so it was a bit pricey but worth it. Would be great for two couples or a family."

Stayed a few nights","John’s place was fantastic. He went over and above providing multiple amenities not found in most AirBnb stays. The bathroom drawers were full of all any possible toiletries that you may need. Not only did he provide top notch brands of shampoo and conditioner, he also provide FOUR different body wash scents. The kitchen had BOTH Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks coffee available, plus many snacks to tide you over after a long day of traveling., including a bottle of wine. The house itself was tastefully decorated and very welcoming. It was clear that the house had recently been refurbished, as it was a very old structure. All the renovations were done with great care and thought. As we were there on a business trip we did not have time to enjoy the outdoor amenities which include a kayak, an outdoor fireplace, and a lake just across the road. Check-in was easy as he provided a code for the door before our arrival. This place ticked all the boxes for the quick business trip we were on, as well as for a longer vacation type stay. As a superhost myself with two AirBnb units that we maintain… I can only say that John has been very successful in creating a welcoming and relaxing environment for his guests."

A cute little snack station with chips and nuts is there as is both Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks coffee. Spring water is available in the kitchen and every appliance that you could need for a comfortable cooking stay is there. I love to cook and bake. During my week there I used the griddle portion of the gas stove and I baked two loafs of bread in the oven. It’s lovely to have a washer and dryer available for use during the visit. Too. The bathroom is spacious with lovely bath supplies. I loved the little private beach a few steps away and visited almost daily. The outdoor property at this B&B is spectacular! It’s roomy and quiet with Gas grill, fire pit, ergo dynamic chairs for lounging, picnic table with umbrella and chairs around the fire pit…and fire starters! The thing I want is stress is that the entire beach association neighborhood is very quiet and friendly. This was R&R rest for me and I enjoyed the quiet, the sunsets, the beach, the walks, the fishing.
I cannot wait to return! 💕"

Stayed a few nights","John was a wonderful host. His communication with us was kind and helpful, and he had so many thoughtful touches around the Airbnb. I have a lot of dietary restrictions, so it was great to have a well-stocked kitchen. I also work in the sustainability field, so I appreciated that John had green/healthy cleaning and personal care products available—many brands that I use myself! The location is beautiful and worked perfectly for a wedding we were in town for in Litchfield. It was easy to park and get in, and the Airbnb is roomy and comfortable with A/C and nice furnishings. We would gladly stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Hands down the cleanest, well organized, comfortable airbnb we have ever stayed. The street is beautiful, calm and quiet. The curb appeal is perfectly done. Check in was a breeze. Upon stepping into the home I was relieved to see that the listing not only matched, but exceeded my expectations. The home looked as if it were brand new....as of that day, that is how clean, tidy and organized it was. You could clearly tell every single detail was perfectly planned out. There is nothing that was lacking. I also very much appreciated the snacks waiting for us, as we hadn't had a moment to eat and I was famished. The bed was truly perfect in comfort, we both slept as though we were at home. The tub was absolutely divine, I felt so pampered. My husband loved the variation of coffee offered. Every necessity has been thoughtful placed in the home. I appreciated being accommodated to stay an extra night, due to weather and really appreciated being able to do a quick load of laundry!!😊"

Stayed a few nights","Who knew that the best Airbnb I’d ever stay in would be located within 45 minutes of home. We chose Jodi and Ralph’s immaculate Mountain escape for our getaway without having to “get away” and we could not have been happier with our choice. Not only was the home spotless (it truly looked as though we were the first people to have ever stayed there), but there so many special and thoughtful touches throughout that truly made the space feel like home. From the slippers left for our comfort, selection of toiletries left for our use, and fresh half and half left in the refrigerator for coffee, every aspect of the home is well thought out to make a guest’s stay easy and comfortable. Plus, Jodi and Ralph were so kind and super easy to communicate with (though there was nothing we ever needed to communicate with them about during the weekend). We wish we could have stayed forever! Thanks again, Jodi and Ralph!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a fabulous stay here. The place is gorgeous, clean, and peaceful. Everything was perfect. Mornings on the front porch, sipping coffee and watching the sunrise was the perfect way to start off the day. We needed a quick escape from the city and Ralph and Jodi's place over-delivered on that. The air smells fresh and amazing, the birds are flying around and singing, and everything about the location is just so peaceful. The home itself is beautiful inside as well. The kitchen is perfect, the decor is tasteful, the bathrooms are clean and upstairs has a great soaking tub, that, if you're into cold plunging, can easily be filled with just cold water for a convenient plunge. The bed and living room were very comfortable as well. Highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Ralph and Jodi's pristine, beautiful house on Mountain Rd. could not have been better for our needs. It was pristine, full of luxurious amenities, such as a Japanese soaking hot tub/shower combo plus a separate half-bath downstairs, pristine, and had a super-comfortable mattress upstairs-the Number One need of an Airbnb traveler, and we slept like dogs. Many wonderful touches, including books on Torrington history, snacks when we arrived at midnight, stress-free, easy entry into the house without bothering the owners, and lovely outdoor furniture that we barely had time to enjoy on our quick trip but loved the few moments we had time to be out there. As I wrote in Ralph & Jodi's book, I honestly couldn't believe it was in Torrington. A bucolic setting with nothing across the street but a lovely pond and impressive stone walls. WOW."

The house itself is immaculate, peaceful, and has amenities that make you not want to leave the property- even though there are plenty of restaurants and things to do near by (there’s a binder inside with a list of places/activities to do!). Our first stay was during the winter months so in comparison staying in the summer it was really nice to be able to sit out on the porch next to the blooming hydrangeas and read. The house is on a quiet road, but very close to near by towns so you don’t need to travel far to places. It is the perfect combo of feeling like you’re peacefully away from everything, but also right in the heart of everything. Would highly recommend staying here and hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"

Stayed about a week","Ralph and Jodi were wonderful hosts - they went out of their way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and easy! The house is immaculate and extremely well appointed. We were easily able to self cater for the duration of our stay, with the exception of a very tasty breakfast at George's restaurant (c/o a $25 gift certificate that Ralph provided us with upon arrival!). The beds and bedding are very comfortable. The construction is brand new, with thoughtful design. While the description for this airbnb indicates a ""tiny house"", it's really quite commodious! The primary bedroom is spacious and boasts a desk, laundry, closet space for clothing, and a beautiful en-suite bathroom with a great shower and soaking tub. The lofted bed sits above the main bedroom and is accessed via a sturdy ladder with thoughtful handholds along the side and at the top to ensure safety and confidence in ascending and descending. The location provides ample privacy and lovely views. We would love to return!"

My unit in this house was well set up for my two month stay. I particularly loved that the kitchen was well equipped. That was so nice. And when I didn't feel like cooking, I loved that there were nice places to eat just a nice walk away. (If you like pizza, you'll love Sasso's!)
You really are located in the heart of the town and whatever you need is just a nice walk away. It's a very historic area of this town and walking around in the neighborhood in itself is very interesting and entertaining. And you can pick up some groceries while you're out.
For short term it is nice. For long term it's great!
Nothing but good things to say."

The house was beautiful: it was bright, clean, and in such a lovely and peaceful setting. My family and I felt safe and right at home from the moment we arrived - it was no surprise that we all slept peacefully. We enjoyed the baked goods from the Wright farm as well; it was a sweet little touch. I was even able to sit on the porch and read my book with a cup of coffee, in the morning sunshine. I can't remember the last time I was able to enjoy a moment like that. I would very gladly stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Jim and Carol's place was everything we'd hoped for and more. We came up from the city to have a cozy, peaceful ski getaway weekend and that's exactly what it turned out to be. When we first entered the house we were thrilled at just how cozy, warm and welcoming we felt right away. There were fresh homemade blueberry muffins and cookies waiting for us on the kitchen counter! They've thought of every little detail to make the experience comfortable, from the softest of tissue paper (it matters!) to warm air blowing on our toes at the sink (heat must come from under the cabinet around the kitchen) The view out the window was magical, snow falling on a beautiful field with birds feeding at a bird feeder.
The icing on the cake was getting to meet Jim and Carol at thier fantastic flea market right across the road in the barn. They are the real deal, truly golden people in every way. An experience we will not forget and can't wait to return to."

Jim and Carol made us feel right at home and went out of their way to accommodate us. Communication was superb, the house is cozy but very clean and neat, with a new bathroom and kitchen. The second bedroom has a twin bed which was a little small for my adult son and he was more comfortable on the couch with sheets and pillows supplied by our hosts. The surrounding farm and barn across the street (has an indoor flea market on Saturday and Sunday) make you feel like your transported back in time to a simpler age. We found Jim's place to be a great place to spend quality time with loved ones!"

For the moment we talked in Jim’s house, his scrumptious and satisfying cookies really uplift our whole day. In addition, his family prepared us one more surprising gift - blueberry muffins - extra-large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. Great hospitality I never ever enjoyed in my entire Airbnb experience.
Furthermore, Jim helped lend me ties to solve my last-minute headache, so I had a terrific presentation for my daughter's graduation ceremony at Kent School. Our family really enjoyed our stay - a great place to relax and reset ourselves – a true love home away from our own house.
Superior host! Two thumbs up!"

They were kind enough to let us know when deer were in the fields- it was a sight that was really special for us. The house was cozy, clean, and charming. There were many thoughtful touches around the home- many interesting books and family games. Jim and Carol were very responsive and made us feel very welcome. They offered early check in and late check out without our asking. We left on a cold windy day and Carol was considerate enough to drop off a care package for our return home. We had an amazing stay in Torrington, mostly due to the peaceful and private stay at this home."

Stayed a few nights","This rental is a perfect getaway from the city! It isn’t too long of drive and the owners are amazing! Very responsive (they provided their cell number and were in the cafe across the street if we needed anything), beautiful home and so warm and toasty during the winter. Additionally, their cafe and antique shop across the street is AMAZING! All the vendors are really sweet and we were able to find newspaper articles from the 50s! Seriously an incredible stay and I can’t wait to come back in the summer.
P.S. As all the other reviews mentioned, the baked goods are delicious! I definitely recommend buying from the cafe before heading home to enjoy later and remember your wonderful trip."

Stayed a few nights","My son and I wanted a place that was primarily near mohawk mountain (where we wanted to go skiing). We needed enough space so we can attend school / work during the day, and go skiing in the afternoon / evening. This place exceeded all of our expectations.
As a host, Jim was beyond accommodating. On our first day, we arrived many hours early. Jim openly communicated with us, told us we can arrive anytime since the place was ready. As soon as we pulled in, he met us in the driveway and helped us get situated. He even suggested we park in the barn (it was snowing hard). Throughout our stay, Jim continued to be an excellent host: he communicated with us whenever there was an issue (the internet service dropped out at some point due to the snow storms, we got regular updates from Jim via cell/sms). My son needed some paper for a homework assignment, Jim provided some. Each day, he dropped off some delicious snacks (cookies, cupcakes, etc.) Every time it snowed, our walkway was shoveled before we even dared peak outside, much less actually go outside. I have yet to meet such a responsive and attentive host. Thank you!
The place itself is also sweet: The place has been renovated: all the windows and outlets and lights and bathroom are brand new, everything is really clean. Each closet is full of all the supplies that we needed, e.g. plenty of extra towels, napkins, Kleenex, cleaning supplies, blankets, coffee (both decaf and regular), anything we needed and beyond, was already there. And, there were plenty of extra touches all around: kit kat chocolates in the living room, extra half/half in the fridge, etc.
We'll definitely be back."

Stayed with kids",The cottage is perfectly situated on an old dairy farm that provides a classic and cozy landscape for any season in Connecticut. The cottage itself is very comfortable and sweet & our hosts were wonderful. They thought of every detail and treated us like old friends from the start. We loved staying here over the holiday season & highly recommend it.

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect place to get away for a weekend trip. The house was cute and quaint and had all of the amenities one could possibly need. There were even some homemade treats left by Jim and Carol upon our arrival, which added to the great hospitality already displayed. The location was central to everything we wanted to do: wineries, downtown, restaurants. Such a lovely weekend spent in Connecticut. Won’t be our last visit that’s for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","I've had the pleasure of staying at tens of airbnbs at this point, throughout the US and abroad, and I am confident in saying Jim's place is in the top 3 (if not top 1) I have experienced. The location is absolutely beautiful, on a quiet road, with great views of fields and nature. Jim and his wife are fantastic hosts: they provided almost immediate responses, helped me out with some questions I had ahead of time, and then were extremely kind once we arrived (e.g. they knew it was my wife's birthday, and were kind enough to leave a birthday card for her). This is a 10/10 listing and I cannot emphasize enough how great it was. I highly recommend for anyone looking to explore some of the natural beauty in CT."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at this little house was a very comfortable and peaceful two days. The place is freaking adorable and the farm surrounding it really gives you an experience of quite country life. Jim and his wife were extremely accommodating to us as we both got locked out and lost the keys right before we were going to leave. Yet we felt nothing but sweetness from our hosts.
We eventually found the keys (on top of the car go figure) and were still treated to the most delicious lunch at the barn cafe (open on saturdays and Sundays)! Oh ya, I almost forgot the complimentary pumpkin cookies that didn't last the ride home.
Very nice people and an excellent location."

Stayed a few nights","My first time in an Airbnb, and Gwen's place will certainly set the standard for comparison for the future. When I arrived, it was easy to access, and while there is a winding staircase, there was more than adequate room to fit my luggage. When I opened the door, I immediately saw the pristine kitchen with a full refrigerator, stove, microwave and even a toaster oven for cooking. a Keurig unit plus some K cups, tea, sweeteners. There was also silverware, cups, glasses, plates and everything you need to serve a. Cleaning supplies and everything else was included. The living room was stocked with games and there was free Netflix as well, but I couldn't find mainstream network and cable channels. There are 5 bedrooms in this unit, and the doors can be locked, so 1 person or a family can stay just by unlocking the number of doors needed. Great bath with a coin washer and dryer as well. fully stocked with personal items! I will definitely return when I return to Torrington!"

Stayed with kids","My sons and I spent one weekend at Cori and Jen’s apartment and had a great experience. The apartment was fully renovated, spotless clean, quiet, and had all we needed.
We met Cori in our second day in their apartment. He was welcoming, friendly and helpful.
The apartment is located walking distance from a commercial center, and a great restaurant called Geppetto, which I strongly recommend.
If we return to that area I will certainly stay in their place again."

The space is even better than the pics with warm decor, soft and comfortable living rm seating and beds. Roomy bathroom with shampoo, body wash and hand soap and plenty of towels. The kitchen is fully outfitted and they even have snacks, waters, and k-cups to get you started which is so appreciated! Really nice counter area. Plenty of lighting, sound machines and luggage racks in both bedrooms. Really appreciate hosts who offer coat/bag hooks near the entry (along with entry mats for wet shoes), as well as plenty of hooks for towels and clothes in the bathroom! HVAC and TV operations are seamless. Corin was is extremely responsive and we enjoyed chatting with him before we had to head out. Can't wait to return!"
