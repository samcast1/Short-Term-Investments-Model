Stayed a few nights","Skye’s place was just right for the two of us attending our kids’ graduation. The guest house is cozy, clean and comfortable. Skye left us a very generous goodie basket on arrival, and had great recommendations listed in a binder. We loved the quiet location with everything just a few minutes away by foot, street car or Uber. The guest house was clean and bright with a very peaceful outdoor space to use. Skye was very responsive to any questions I had which was so helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed their sweet Lab Olive who was always excited to see us when she came outside. This is a ten out of ten!!"

Stayed about a week","What could possibly be added to the raving reviews for this gem of an accomodation?
Located in Audubon, one of the loveliest neighbourhoods around, this is a feast for anyone who likes a stroll, be it in the wonderful park or just meandering around the streets. A lovely, old school supermarket - Langenstein's- is just a few blocks and away (and, being New Orleans, of course they have fresh seafood...) as is the St Charles streetcar.
The carriage house with the lush garden and the refreshing pool (what a gift in this climate!) is the oasis one longs to have in a bustling city like this, having all the amenities one could wish for and then some.
We were here for Jazzfest and couldn't possibly have been happier about everything. Skye is the loveliest and most generous host imaginable and with her crew of husband Rasch and dog-in-chief Olive added in so many ways to our time here - we laughed a lot together and just had the best of times."

Skye has everything you might possibly need readily available and is helpful in recommendations for the area. My partner and I stayed here for our elopement and Skye saved the day helping me zip my wedding dress! Olive’s sweet and exuberance presence was delightful! I would recommend this home and hope to stay again, maybe for an anniversary 🥰 Thank you Skye!"

Walkable, beautiful neighborhood, and Audubon Park was super close. Plus, their sweet dog Olive was a very cute greeter who walked us to and from our door whenever she was in the yard. (We will miss her!) We couldn’t have asked for a better host or stay than we had - Skye was friendly, accommodating, and communicative!"

It was a lovely place in a great part of town. As a runner, I particularly appreciated how close it was to Audubon Park, St Charles Ave and the Mississippi. Skye was a great host, and we especially enjoyed some quality time with Olive, the Black Lab. Another highlight: lots of books, treats, and things of interest stashed away in the carriage house, all very carefully curated. We were the lucky beneficiaries of the love that went in to creating this beautiful and peaceful space."

Stayed about a week","Skye's New Orleans carriage house is a true treasure, offering an exceptional stay that exceeded our expectations. As an innkeeper, Skye's meticulous touch is evident in every corner - the house is stocked with everything you need - and the well-designed layout allows for seamless transitions between work and relaxation. The property exude coziness, complemented by the charm of fruit trees gracing the outdoor space.
Skye's hospitality is unmatched – prompt responsiveness, local recommendations, and thoughtful gestures like providing blankets for a day at the park or bicycles for neighborhood exploration. The neighborhood itself is both safe and enchanting, with the sweet addition of Olive, Skye's friendly dog.
Our arrival was marked by a charming gift basket. Having lived in New Orleans and visited frequently, I confidently assert that Skye's carriage house is the epitome of a perfect NOLA stay. Whether you're a local or a first-time visitor, this spot is unbeatable. We'll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying in this 1890 carriage house was a pure delight. The space was perfect!The house was overall charming, clean, and comfortable, but of course we came to New Orleans to experience the city. Thankfully, our hosts prepared a helpful binder full of suggestions for local restaurants, nightlife, etc. I always appreciate when hosts do this. Staying in the quiet, beautiful Audubon area allowed us to start each day with a peaceful morning walk around the park. We were less than 10 minutes’ drive from popular Cajun restaurants and some lively streets full of fun shopping and coffee shops. The location was also easily walkable to the Trolley, which allowed direct access to the French Quarter, Bourbon Street, and Frenchman Street. We had a wonderful weekend, and are grateful to our hosts, who were friendly but not overbearing. They made us feel welcome and at home, like we were staying with family. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!"

Stayed a few nights","Skye’s place was nearly as delightful as her generous and kind hospitality. The private and separate building were quiet and pristine. The decor and decked out furnishings included all you would need.. extra towels, blankets, sheets, etc as well as a kitted out kitchen and bath. The outdoor space was beautiful with a pool, eating area and lounging chairs- as well as a bbq and friendly pup❤️. Skye was communicative and thoughtful in ways that far exceeded any expectation of an Airbnb. From the homemade banana bread and breakfast items, gift basket of goodies to pool floaters and dog treats! Lovely walkable uptown neighborhood close to everything yet quiet and private. Plenty of open parking and safe. Definitely recommend and will certainly stay again when looking for a Nola landing spot!"

What struck me most about this home was how quiet and peaceful it was. Despite being in a bustling neighborhood, the home was tucked away in a serene corner that made it feel like a true retreat. I appreciated the opportunity to escape the noise and chaos of the outside world without sacrificing any of the conveniences of modern living.
Overall, I highly recommend this Airbnb home for anyone looking for a peaceful, relaxing getaway. Whether you're looking to spend your days lounging by the pool or exploring the surrounding area, this home is the perfect choice. I can't wait to come back and stay again!"

Away from the maddening crowds and walking distance to the St Charles tram line and Milwaukee street. If you didn’t know NOLA has a fantastic sculpture garden and gallery, all within the public transport area. I would love to stay at Skyes again. Coming home from a day of sightseeing and floating in the saltwater pool with a welcoming glass of wine was wonderful. We walked down beautiful streets to restaurants. And yes we did go to the French quarter and Bourbon Street, enjoyed it for a few hours and then retreated. Perfect!"

Relaxing on their gorgeous patio with the afternoon sun dancing on the pool is just magical and being greeted by Olive, the dog, makes it even better. With Audubon Park so close, St. Charles streetcar and Whole Foods in walking distance, it couldn’t be in a better location. Skye has gone to great lengths to make the Carriage House feel like you are staying with friends with a bottle of wine, delicious homemade banana bread, and morning juice waiting in the fridge. The cottage exudes a beautiful attention to detail and the essence southern hospitality, plus all the amenities you accidentally left at home thoughtfully provided.

Her thoughtfulness in providing snacks and drinks was very welcoming to weary travelers. A plethora of reading material with suggestions for enjoying New Orleans is available in every room.
Skye is so friendly, and anxious to make you feel at home. She was quick to respond to any and all questions.
The location is great. A quick walk to St. Charles Street to catch the streetcar, or stroll to Magazine Street for some shopping and restaurants.
The added perk is Miss Olive, the friendly Labrador, ready to greet you.
From start to finish, our visit at the Carriage House will be one which brings happy memories and smiles."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic stay at Skye’s place! As a frequent Airbnb guest, I’m so appreciative of the thoughtful treats on arrival and a well-stocked kitchen. It really makes all the difference. The carriage house is both comfortable and lovely, with lots of nice touches. It’s also perfect location uptown just a couple of blocks from St. Charles, Audubon Park, Tulane, etc. Communication and access were easy, and I can’t wait to come back!"

Best location right next to Audubon Park. Will definitely be back to visit Skye and Olive (adorable black lab puppy) on any future trips to New Orleans!

Stayed a few nights","Wonderfully charming carriage house with every amenity and perfectly situated in a quaint part of the Uptown Garden District. We loved being close to Audubon Park, Tulane, St. Charles streetcar, Magazine Street shops and restaurants - it was the perfect location for our visit to NOLA!
The layout of the space is full of light, cozy and functional - a nice, open well-appointed kitchen, comfortable living room and the upstairs bedroom has a nice warm feel – the huge walk-in closet was especially helpful for us.
After going for a run on a day that was a little too hot for exercise the pool was very refreshing, and even when not swimming we enjoyed just lounging on the chairs and enjoying the pretty patio surrounded by numerous nice plants and fruit trees.
Cute lab Olive stole our hearts with her energy and affection (gave us a nice consolation from missing our own dog).
This was one of our most favorite airb&b stays (and we’ve stayed at a lot!). Skye was a fantastic host with great communication, very attentive to all our needs during our stay - went above and beyond which we greatly appreciated.
We will make this our home away from home every time we visit NOLA. We can’t recommend enough. 10 stars!!!!! Thx Skye for welcoming us into your home. We can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed about a week","I stayed 8 days in this gem of a house in uptown New Orleans. Warmly greeted by Skye and Olive (their 2 year old black lab) I settled in for a comfortable stay.
The carriage house is very quaint; tastefully furnished and offers all you need:
- A very comfortable bed; I slept well every evening.
- A kitchen with all necessary appliances and utensils. There were some basics on hand for my first morning: coffee, milk, yoghurt and cereal.
- Bathroom toiletries which were much appreciated.
- Within walking distance to Whole Foods.
- A stones throw from the streetcar (Saint Charles) which will take you to downtown.
- The owners are directly on hand if you have any questions.
If you are looking for an authentic experience in a beautiful part of New Orleans this is the place for you.
Thank you Skye, Rasch and Olive 🐾"

Stayed a few nights","My stay at the coach house was exceptional. It was light-filled, spotless, organized, charmingly decorated & inviting - what a treat to stay in such a beautiful, historic home nestled within a neighborhood of other such homes. Her welcome offering of delicious homemade banana bread and other treats & basics was an unexpected but much appreciated bonus. Skye has seemingly thought of all the amenities and extras one might need in a pinch & perhaps might have forgotten when packing. I told her I wish my own home was so well-equipped and organized! The bed was so comfortable and it was glorious to wake up in that sunny space and hear the pool fountain going! She also provided a comprehensive array of New Orleans guidebooks and a handy binder of recommended local attractions & restaurants which I frequently consulted. The lovely pool is a huge perk - a welcome respite from the heat. And last but certainly not least there was the intermittent company of black lab Olive in the yard - the goodwill ambassador of the place! I loved it all and can't wait to stay again. This summary is long but that's only because there are so many reasons to recommend the coach house!"

The house is in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance of the St Charles street car, amenities like District Donuts and wholefoods (to stock up on snacks and drinks to keep at the house). We really enjoyed the patio at night and dipping our feet in the salt water pool during the day. Skye and Rache were filled with suggestions on things to do and see. A+++!"

Stayed a few nights","A charming Parisian style carriage house that is absolutely warm and inviting. Everything went together beautifully - furniture (especially the bed, amazingly comfortable), linens, dining ware, books, games…just perfect in every way. I felt extremely safe in this beautiful residential neighborhood because I could easily walk to Tulane campus, dine and shop on Magazine street, or hop on the tram towards another part of town. Skye is a very responsive host who pays attention to details. Everything was immaculate and when you walk in you are greeted with a wonderful welcome basket filled with treats (eg. homemade banana bread, yes, homemade, chips, sweets and wine!) and the refrigerator was lightly stocked with beverages and light snacks, a very lovely touch. I also really appreciated the binder of full of useful directions and information, including many spot on recommendations for different areas of NOLA. And let’s not forget Olive, your friendly four legged host! It’s just the most adorable place and I have nothing negative to say. I wish I could have stayed longer and hope to be lucky enough to come back! 💕"

Stayed a few nights","I'm torn writing this review for fear that it will take me another 2 years to get the chance to stay at this place. It is rated #1 for a reason, and after having lived in the Crescent City for a spell, I would say the best experience for satisfying your NOLA withdrawals. Mornings under the Oaks in Audubon, followed by lazy dips in the crystal clear salt water pool, Skye and her family graciously share a piece of history to live in. Everything was clean and thoughtfully provided, including a stocked kitchen and welcoming wine and gift basket (after travelling all day, it's so refreshing to know you don't have to buy milk for coffee). Upstairs and down had blue tooth speakers, cool blowing AC, and a vintage bed with crisp white linens. I cannot say enough positives, thank you Skye for sharing this gift!"

The home has everything you need for your stay, including stylish vintage pieces much warmer than your average property. We used the bikes to explore much of the city and loved returning to the beautiful pool. We’d highly recommend this property!"

There are tiny thoughtful touches (i.e. eye masks for sleeping, makeup remover in the bathroom, etc.) all over. The location is close to the street car stop.

With Audobon Park so close and the trolly line in walking distance, it couldn’t be in a better location.
Skye has gone to great lengths to make the Carriage House feel like you are staying with friends with a bottle of wine, delicious homemade banana bread, and morning juice waiting in the fridge. The cottage exudes a beautiful attention to detail and the essence southern hospitality. Skye is wonderfully friendly, available, and truly gracious.

The location was also perfect (walkable for exploring Magazine St. and the Freret St. neighborhood and very close to the street cars for further treks into the city)!
As far as lodging, the upstairs bedroom was spacious, bright, and super comfortable. We even elected to stay in and cook dinner one night to get some extra time at the pool; the kitchen and living areas were cozy and had everything we needed to do this.
Finally, Skye was great. She was communicative, available, mindful of privacy, and very kind! Her book of recommendations and welcome surprises were added bonuses. We enjoyed meeting her AND Olive. Would 1000% recommend staying here if you have the chance; we certainly will if we have the opportunity again."

Location is lovely, especially if you have been to New Orleans before - allows the opportunity to walk to and explore some lesser (tourist) seen aspects of the Big Easy experience. We loved sitting by the pool and simply enjoying our time. As a note, the AirBnB does have a dog on the property, we are very much dog people so loved Olive. However, if you do not like dogs I would be very clear with Skye upfront."

Stayed a few nights","The perfect stay for our first visit to New Orleans! This charming carriage house is located on a quiet tree-lined street, just a block from the St. Charles streetcar for easy access to the French Quarter, Garden District, Audubon Park, etc. We loved walking the neighborhood, admiring all the beautiful architecture. Hosts were amazing...always available to answer our questions, offer recommendation or just sit and chat about the history of the home. We had all we needed for a comfortable stay during our three days in New Orleans."

Skye was the best host we’ve ever had—she went above and beyond from a thoughtful welcome basket and note to stocking the carriage house with anything we could need. The location is also amazing—you can walk out the door and walk through the beautiful neighborhood to Audubon park or magazine street. We hope to come back soon!"

Nice touches include a welcome basket with homemade banana bread and interesting books about NOLA scattered throughout. The layout, cozy and thoughtful, was perfect for two people in town to enjoy the city but also work from afar. I worked at a desk upstairs placed at a window; my husband worked at the kitchen table downstairs. Loved the half bath downstairs and the nice spacious full bath upstairs. Loved the big walk-in closet. We'll be back."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Carriage House was nothing short of fantastic. We've stayed at many airbnbs that have been great, with really good hosts, but the Carriage House and Skye was by far one of the best. The location is in a quiet, upscale neighborhood just a short walk away from the St. Charles Streetcar, which will take you to all of the popular areas of New Orleans. The house is located in the back of their main family house, but we immediately felt comfortable and at home. We never felt like we were intruding. The welcome basket with New Orleans touches was the best way to start our weekend getaway. The house is packed with amenities - kitchen, bath, linens, games, books, you name it. It has that classic southern charm but is spotlessly clean (and not haunted, tee hee). If you have a chance to stay here, I highly recommend it for a nice, quiet getaway. Tulane University is very close. Audubon Park is just down the street. We chose the Carriage House for a couple weekend to celebrate a birthday and have a brief escape from the upcoming Chicago winter."

Not only is it perfectly located for those who wish to be near Tulane and Audubon Park, but the carriage house is adorable and so peaceful. Sky met us upon our arrival, had many nice treats in the kitchen, truly going above and beyond. We loved meeting their new pup Olive as well as their daughter. The carriage house had every possible thing we needed with its beautiful french country style. We did carry out from restaurants and ate most dinners outside at their table which was beautiful at night with the glow of the pool. While our son has been in college, we've stayed at over a half dozen air b'bs in NOLA. This is by far our favorite. We plan to return this spring!"

Stayed a few nights","Scene: The gorgeous, brick-lined, deep-blue backyard pool.
Floating aimlessly with a chilled glass of rosè, listening to the birds scurrying back and fro, and watching the tree leaves wave at you in the afternoon breeze makes the perfect combo to believe, even if temporarily, you actually DO live in the Garden District. What a dream!
Until the day comes when you do actually have a house here, the least you must do is stay at Skye’s place. She’s communicative and welcoming, and has a nice little surprise for guests during their stay (I won’t ruin the surprise).
Olive, their black lab puppy, will also make you her best friend. Don’t bother arguing with her. Just let the puppy love wash right over you. And then go for another dip in the pool to cool off ahead of some delicious dinner on Magazine Street (we recommend Shaya)."

The cottage is clean and inviting and the pool is a welcome addition. And Skye is available when you need her or for a friendly chat while also respecting privacy. I can't say enough positive things about my experience. I have been home one day and looking at a calendar to plan my next stay at this wonderful cottage."

Beautiful appointments and such a comfortable wonderful place. Lovely sheets and towels which are usually my biggest pet peeve with most places. She had a wonderful basket filled with snacks ( including homemade pumpkin bread) which lasted the week. We are ready to pack our bags and move in permanently. The location just a few blocks from Tulane and Audubon Park could not have been better. We used the back yard every day. The lovely chaise lounges were so comfy and we enjoyed the pool after a full day of eating out and exploring New Orleans. We will be back!

Stayed a few nights","There are so many great things about this place! First, the location is perfect, in a very walkable area, close to St. Charles with the streetcar that can transport you to the Garden District or French Quarter, and within walking distance to Magazine St., Audubon Park, Tulane and Loyola. The homes in the area are beautiful, and you can spend more than a few mornings or evenings strolling around and letting time slip away!
Next, the carriage home itself is very comfy, a welcoming retreat with a large bedroom and bath on the 2nd level and a well thought-out living space including a half bath on the ground floor. It is a refreshing space, with full kitchen (with window overlooking pool and lemon trees) and comfortable sofa for lounging (or sleeping as it pulls out to a sofa bed). The home is sparkling clean, and fresh! The outdoor space with lovely pool was the perfect place to unwind, and enjoy time with family and friends. We spent an entire day of our long weekend in the pool!
Skye is a gracious host, who has truly thought of everything, including a sweet welcome basket with goodies and yummy New Orleans coffee. There are extra cozy blankets, towels, etc. to make you feel at home as well. We celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday here, and the carriage house was the perfect backdrop for creating memories of a lifetime. We will most certainly visit this wonderful home again!"

Stayed with kids","Unit 1 was super charming! It was just what we were looking for to give us a real NOLA experience. The inside was beautifully decorated just like the photos and felt very clean. As for location, it was close enough to walk to the French Quarter but distanced enough to feel tranquil. We loved getting baked goods from the bakery downstairs and enjoying on the spacious balcony. My kids liked playing across the street in Washington Park. Overall, it was a great place to stay and we would stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","My sister, mother and I, visited this quaint little Air BnB for a ladies’ birthday weekend and had an amazing time. The place was super clean, had a great open set up and was fully stocked. We could not have asked for anything more. We enjoyed the music from the balcony each night, and loved being able to be close to everything that was in walking distance. It is a little noisy at night, but if you want the ambience of NOLA, then this is the place to be. The place was also on the 2nd story, over a bakery, of which was absolutely ahhhmmazing!! Kay was prompt and proactive and making sure we were taken care of."

The bakery downstairs is delicious. So you aren’t surprised, you do share the balcony with another unit and it is New Orleans so there will be some cars cruising late night with their music blasting. But music is everywhere including your own record player - loved it!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved this apartment. The location is great; the high ceilings, beautiful balcony and brightness of the apt is very appealing; and it is very clean and comfortable. Two things to note, apart from everything that is good about it, is that it would have been good to know that one of the two bedrooms is completely internal and has no window. The other thing is that even though it's away from the bustle of the French Quarter, there were incredibly loud party buses and cars that paraded past late at night, on a regular basis. Apparently this is an issue in a lot of areas, but we were very pleased that we had brought our ""white noise"" machine. We would definitely go back tho."

Late night sitting on the balcony could listen to jazz coming from the Spotted Cat down on Frenchman after an evening out. Apartment was immaculate and beds so comfy! The stay was everything we hoped for and more. Also loved running down to the bakery in the am for fresh baked goods. Exceptional stay. Highly recommend.

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is spacious and gorgeous! The high ceiling and wooden floors throughout as well as a wide wrap-around balcony give it that typical New Orleans-vibe. Special mentions for the stylish bathroom with a great shower; clean and soft bedding; a victrola player to play some jazz records. It's about a 15-minute walk to the centre of the French quarter, a stroll we much enjoyed as it created a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon street. The Marigny neighbourhood is also very picturesque. The building is about a block away from some of the well-known jazz bars on Frenchmen street (Spotted Cat, Maison, ...), which is plenty of distance to avoid hearing music inside the apartment, but light sleepers might want to pack ear plugs as you do hear groups of people making their way to and from these bars. Ayu bakehouse on the ground floor has amazing buns and rolls; there's also a Ruby Slipper Cafe branch nearby. We'll definitely stay here again on our next NOLA visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Just book it! I’ve traveled to NOLA many times and this by far is my favorite Airbnb. The space is gorgeous, warm, and welcoming. The high ceilings are stunning. There are two beds which worked out perfectly. The larger room is closer to the street and has a king bed which I found softer. The smaller room has a firmer queen bed and it was exactly what I needed for a great nights rest. Additionally, the smaller bedroom helps muffle street noise and is perfect for lighter sleepers such as myself. The home is nestled above a delicious bakery which offers coffee, pastries, and breads. I enjoyed sitting out on the wrap around porch and watching the locals do Tai Chi in the park while sipping on my morning coffee. Kay is a fantastic host. She is responsive, kind and incredibly helpful. If I had a question she would swiftly reply. Kay embodies the title “Super Host”. Top-notch home with a top-notch host. This will not be my last stay here."

Stayed a few nights","The Grand Balcony was a great option for our four person group. There is a coffee spot directly under the apartment. You can walk a couple of blocks to get to major areas. The place was clean, spacious, and comfortable. We spent every night on the balcony listening to the sounds below. It is a city, so you can't except quiet at night. The in-unit washer and dryer was great because you will need to change a few times a day with that heat. Ubers are readily available (1 min arrival).
The linens on the bed were a little uncomfortable --they felt like the towels (starchy basket weave). There may have been softer blankets somewhere but I didn't find them.
The check out procedure asked us to:
turn air to certain degree
leave linens on bed
hang towels in bathroom
run dishwasher
place garbage in foyer
It was easy and reasonable compared to other Airbnbs.
Overall, nice stay!! I would recommend it."

It is walking distance from the French Quarter and the Bywater. The mattress and sheets in the larger bedroom were very comfortable. I didn't stay in the smaller bedroom, but my friends didn't complain about any issues.
We loved the paint colors, very high cielings, and decor. The balcony and livingroom were both great for hanging out.
The bathroom doesn't have a bathtub, but the shower is nice.
The kitchen is fully functional.

This well-appointed flat is above a bakery, across the street from a park, and a half block away from live music and restaurants on Frenchmen, and there is an adorable wrap around porch to see and hear the action. Can’t beat it. Great people-watching spot. It’s more than we would have usually paid per night, but worth the splurge for our nieces graduation gift. Thurs-Sat can have a loud music/tour bus or two that goes by late at night, but I brought ear plugs so it was fine. The bedroom without a window in it was even more soundproof. The bakery offers specialty coffees, decadent, delicious, and fresh pastries, with gluten free options available. The flat is beautiful and comfortable inside and out! This was our fourth visit to this city, and you won’t find a better location if you want easy access to all that NoLa has to offer."

Incredibly high ceilings, a turntable with fun vintage New Orleans vinyl, chic decor. Parking on street easy to find. We were there for Mardi Gras and on Fri and Sat nights there were some cars blasting music that cruised by late into the night, so earplugs might be helpful. Other than that it was quiet - no crowds, etc. Right near Frenchman St and easy walk to the Quarter. Would definitely stay again!"

Easy (walking) access to French quarter, museums, bars etc. Parking was across the street and was fine for us, but I can see how it could be an issue at a busier time of year. There was a problem with the keypad when we arrived, but it was fixed very quickly. Great communication from host. I would gladly stay here again. It was like stepping back in time. If there are any ghosts, they are well-mannered classy ghosts. (We didn't happen across any). Highly recommend.

Stayed a few nights","I had initially booked a hotel. However I cancelled that as I was travelling with my son and we decided we preferred to have separate bedrooms with plenty of space to chill out.
Turns out we hit the jackpot. The hotel district is way to far away from the best spots. This place, on Frenchmen was just a short two blocks from the best bars and music in town and far enough away to not be affected by the noise.
It was also very close to the main tourist attractions - French Quarter, Steamboat, trolley busses, jazz museum etc without being on top of them.
It also has a v cool balcony that is great to sit out on and is above a very good artisanal bakery. We also loved the retro turntable that we could hook up our phones to via bluetooth to play music.
We hit the jackpot and Kay was extremely helpful for the whole stay. No regrets."

Stayed a few nights","Oodles of charm and a stellar location - when you are in Kay's place you know you're in New Orleans. High ceilings, tall windows (lots of light), a wrap around porch and hard wood floors. The bathroom has been updated, so it was nice to have a modern shower. Beds were comfy and no complaints about the sheets. Despite the freezing weather outside I was actually too warm with the comforter (which is the trend in all hotels and many Airbnbs) - I would suggest adding a regular blanket in the closet, which could also be used in the living room since old houses run so cold. Too bad we couldn't utilize the porch, it's quite a bonus.
Noise level was not a problem FYI.
Kitchen is up to date (nice gas stove) but I wouldn't get too ambitious with cooking at home (and few people do when they are vacationing in NOLA), the pots, pans and kitchen ware were very basic. I'm all for non-stick pans but once they get beat up they need to be replaced. The apartment is a bit sparse, but tasteful"

We had free street parking every day/night beside the house. There are several great breakfast places within a few blocks and, of course, lots of excellent restaurants in the larger area for lunch and dinner. The bakery right underneath the apartment is excellent.
We loved the balcony, although there was a lot of noise at times. On several days, workmen were doing construction work in the park across the street, and at night Frenchmen Street has quite loud traffic. Inside, the house is quiet. In the early morning the balcony was a peaceful place to watch people walking dogs and doing yoga in the park. The many crows in this part of town were fun to watch, as was the squirrel working on a nest high in the trees. Kay was very responsive to a few of our questions."

It is perfectly positioned near Frenchmen street with a picturesque park across the street. We loved lounging on the covered porch in the mornings and evenings. A 10/10 experience!!!

Stayed a few nights","Outstanding location for music lovers. It’s just two blocks to the street with the best Jazz clubs in New Orleans! Rooms were quiet enough to sleep, and strains of jazz reach you from the balcony. Weekend nights were hopping with street music.
We spent lots of time relaxing on the veranda, which faces beautiful Washington Park. Great way to wind down before bed or enjoy a sunny morning.
Kay was kind enough to allow us in early when our flights arrived, so we didn’t have to haul luggage around town the first afternoon. There was a brief moment when we could not enter as early as planned due to door code issues, but that was quickly resolved.
Highly recommended! I want to come back to this Airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","We had the most amazing stay here. The space is so comfortable and beautiful. The bathroom is well appointed, the bed (we only used the king) was very comfy, and the coffee was very appreciated! The interior is truly spectacular (we're already trying to figure out how to replicate the base boards and crown moulding lol), but my absolute favorite spot was on the porch. We're early risers, so watching the some come up through the trees in the park and listening to the birds sing was magical. Frenchmen Street is a bit noisy on Friday & Saturday night, but nothing more than we expected and it doesn't go all night. Within short walking distance was music venues, great coffee, great breakfast, and if you're up for longer walks, the trek over to the garden district is a fun way to burn off a few beignets :) We can't wait to come stay again!"

The porch is fantastic, the beds super comfy, and the space well-appointed. The Marigny is close to everything—we could explore funky neighborhoods by day, and bounce down Frenchman St. by night. If your group is larger, ask about the apartment next door, which shares the porch."

Being next to the park helps to keep the noise down a bit. Windows, just like the building are beautiful and historic (i.e. thin), so know that you’ll hear everything outside. It keeps the experience lively. Go around the corner to Ruby Slipper for breakfast and lunch. Kay was extremely responsive. The house is spacious, nicely equipped, and the balcony is wonderful."

Our host gave us confidence that she would be very flexible with our reservation if there were any hiccups with the flight, etc. and allowed us to stow our luggage and enter the apartment as soon as it was ready which was very much appreciated. Thank you, Kay, for your prompt and helpful communications! You helped make our weekend getaway a success!"

In the evening, the air if filled with the sound of music from Frenchman street (The Spotted Cat, The Blue Nile, Snug Harbor and other venues) just blocks away. It is a part of NOLA on the edge of the French Quarter that will be appreciated by visitors who prefer Frenchman Street to Bourbon Street although the latter is still quite accessible. Both the owner AND property manager are accessible and responsive during our stay which was no less wonderful having been cut short by IDA. This is our new ""home away from home"" in New Orleans and we will be back."

The location is the perfect distance to bourbon st for those that are looking for both a good time and the ability to have a little more quiet space. The jazz bars along Frenchmen are much closer yet still far enough away that you have the opportunity to enjoy the tranquility of the balcony space.
Paid parking is available right along the street in front of the house which we took advantage of and found it very convenient. The space itself was beautiful and extremely well done. Spacious bedrooms with ample living space all surrounded by a fantastic balcony that was the focal point of our weekend. The balcony along with the large windows gives the space a larger than expected feeling. No matter the activity plans while staying in New Orleans the Balcony on Frenchmen is a great place to stay and enjoy.

This spot is close enough to the action of Frenchman and the Quarter, but far enough away (3 min walk to Frenchman hustle) to get the sensory break you’ll need after a day/eve in NOLA. The space is super classy and clean. The wraparound porch is delightful. And, if it’s hot, the AC works great. The check in/out is easy, and Kay is super responsive. So, just do it!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Kay’s place for a short trip to NOLA and had a wonderful time!
The apartment is in a great location, just a short walk from Bourbon St. and the waterfront with tons of bars just minutes away. Despite being so close, the noise of nearby bar patrons did not disturb us, even on the weekend when there were many more local visitors.
The apartment itself is beautifully decorated and the balcony is a great plus — perfect for relaxing in the morning and after a long day on the town.
If I ever find myself in NOLA again, I’d book Kay’s place in a heartbeat. Thanks for a great stay!"

The air-con works perfectly (much needed in NOLA), and it feels so traditional to relax on the balcony.

Stayed a few nights","Apartment #1 was roomy, super clean and like the photos very stylish. The deck outside is huge and overlooks a park below. The location is really good because it’s walking distance to all the French Quarter but far enough from Bourbon to not be affected by its noise. There are a lot of music clubs on Frenchman street which is nearby and some nights you can hear a bit of it but it was not an issue. There is even a white noise machine in the main bedroom that was very effective eliminating any outside sounds while sleeping. Overall we were extremely happy with the apartment and will return again. Kay the host was very responsive answering all our questions very quickly."

Stayed a few nights","Several reviews mentioned how quiet the location was, but unfortunately our experience was the complete opposite of peaceful. Between the all-day jackhammering in the park, the constant stream of construction and delivery vehicles, and the inebriated people screaming at each other in the middle of the night, we strongly considered moving to a hotel just to get away from the noise. Also, because the first floor is vacant and for lease, there were unhoused residents sitting or sleeping outside our door pretty much the entire duration of our stay. Other reviews are absolutely correct that the inside is beautifully restored and the balcony is lovely, but because we are (apparently) very sensitive to street noise, I am sorry to say we would not stay here again."

Rodney’s bungalow is a great spot for a couple or two to explore the city. His team did good job providing all the essentials and preparing it for guests.
The hot tub was not in a state which we felt comfortable or safe to use, even after the chlorine bomb to help remedy. Inquire regarding this amenity if it is important to you."

Stayed a few nights","This unit is very close to Frenchman street, Esplanade, and the French quarter making everything very walkable. The swim pool/spa combo with the covered back patio was definitely a highlight during our stay. The unit was very clean although a bit heavy handed with the air freshener which seemed to be drowning out the musty, damp smell from the bathroom. Make sure to bring your own creamer for the coffee bar! This location does have multiple noisemakers makers inside to help with the expected noise you’ll get from the late night crowd leaving Frenchman street. Overall this location is good for a couple or a small group that doesn’t mind sharing some close sleeping quarters as the two bedrooms are right next to each other and one must be traversed to get to the bathroom."

This utterly charming Airbnb is in the perfect location, close to the action of Frenchmen st & the quarter with bars, restaurants, coffee shops, live music & public transport mere minutes away. It is extremely walkable. I'd especially recommend this place to families. We had the best time walking to all the sights and at the end of the day it was SO nice to not have far to go. Check-in & Parking was a breeze and we never had an issue. We felt very safe and secure which was a big concern especially bc our kids were with us. We were able to safely show them the magic of NOLA and they LOVED it! The Swim Spa put this place over the top for us! It was a real treat to soak every day and relax. This is an extremely old house with buttery smooth wood floors, original historic details, modern conveniences and a serene energy. It was clean, quiet and the beds were very comfortable. We slept great! Rodney is an excellent host. Book here! You won't regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","Rodney's place was awesome! Even my hard to please travel companion was satisfied enough to stay an extra day. Rodney was always responsive with our questions and one minor issue. It's a beautifully decorated typical NoLa type shotgun wth all the charm and quirks of 100+ year old houses. If you travel deep in winter, bring your warmer pjs. The location is great: just one street over from Frenchman which is full of restaurants and bars across every price point. The French Quarter is walkable for those in decent shape, but it's a inexpensive ride share hop, too. We never had any problems with parking, although I was careful to stay parked during parade day. Easy access to see most of the walking parades. If you're a light sleeper the front bedroom is along the route between Frenchman and other etertainment spots in the Marighny, so you'll hear folks coming and going. That's part of being in the action, so to speak, so prepare accordingly. Definitely added to our ""will stay again"" list!"

Stayed with a pet","We were lucky to book Rodney's home last minute for our Christmas trip to New Orleans. It's in an amazing location, making it super easy to walk to the French Quarter and explore all the streets and shops. Also, just minutes away we had Ayu Bakeshop and SukhoThai which are absolutely amazing and a must try when in NOLA. Parking in the streets was super easy. Rodney's home has lots of character and nicely decorated. Being a great location means you can hear street noises but all the rooms have noise machines which was helpful for our dogs. There is a humid smell which is normal for an old house but having scents would've been nice. If staying with pets, there isn't green area in the patio or in the street but there is a wide strip in the road and a park just a block away. Highly recommend if you want to have a more walkable experience in NOLA."

We stayed with our dog - it was fine but in general not a great area for pups with less walking options and not a lot of grass areas anywhere near by. Note there is no lounge area in this property.
The ambient noise machines are a great add and we didn’t notice much street noise."

From traditional jazz to blues, funk, reggae, and everything in between, there is a diverse range of performances happening every night.

We walked all over and did not have to Uber because of the close proximity to the house.

Stayed a few nights","What a fantastic stay! We had an amazing visit to New Orleans thanks to this stay. It is perfectly located near Frenchman Street, the French Quarter, Marginay, Bywater, a direct shot down Esplanade to City Park and so much more. The swim spa is fantastic to enjoy morning, noon or night. We would venture out in the morning for breakfast, do a walking tour in the Garden District, grab lunch, come back and recharge in the hot tub, take a nap, head out to Bachanal Wine Bar which is just a 20 minute stroll away or into the French Quarter or down to the waterfront. This location and host are just the best. I couldn't imagine having stayed anywhere else. Do yourself a favor and book this!"

Stayed with kids","This place is in a great spot. You are near all the action and walking distance to, but not in it. The giant hot tub was really nice to use. It was a little dirty but the host was on it.
things to be aware of the property - the place is very old 150+ years and has a lot of character but doesn't seal well to the outside. you can hear people walking outside if they were in the living room. the doors don't exactly feel secure either. the train runs through town all day and all morning blowing its whistle. So it's not what I would call a peaceful retreat if that's what you're after. it's still very fun. The beds are comfy."

The house is walkable to so many great spots and an easy walk to the quarter. The neighborhood is cute and safe. The parking for the house is on the street and we never had a problem getting a spot right in front of the house. We enjoyed the swim spa too! The house is clean and nicely furnished with comfortable beds and linens and plenty of towels. We would definitely book this place again!

Stayed a few nights","I really wanted to like this place but the plumbing smell made it unpleasant. Here is the good and the not so good:
WHAT WORKED
- Location: The location is ideal. I chose this unit because of its proximity to iconic Frenchmen Street and our friend's home (5 mins away). We walked a lot and walking to the French Quarter and street car/public transportation was a breeze from this location. Felt safe and was quiet.
- Eats + People: There are plenty of yummy cafes, bars, and restaurants near the location. Folks were really friendly and we had lots of random conversations with locals and visitors.
- The unit: The beds were comfy, plenty of closet and dresser space, there was nice lighting, TVs in living room and bedroom, the temp in the unit was always nice, there are ACs in the living room and bedroom in the loft section. The kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, utensils, cups and all that. The fridge ran well. Although the unit is old, it is clean.
WHAT DIDN'T WORK
- The smell: There was a plumbing issue that we first thought was a dead animal (thought it was coming from the patio which is why we never went out there) then realized it was coming from the drains in the bathroom (note: the bathroom is very small, the door doesn't close fully, the bathroom drain is not flush to the floor which makes it awkward to navigate while showering, and the water pressure is weak). May as well note: the unit itself is old (part of that NOLA architectural charm) so this is gonna have all the funky little things that old places have: doors that aren't flush with the frames, tall ceilings to mitigate heat, old windows painted shut--none of this bothered me but I imagine in the summer, with bugs, it can be a concern.
Back to the smell: The smell permeated the entire unit. It was awful at times. We noticed that it smelled less when we would run the shower but when we would come back in the afternoon/evening, it reeked as it dried out. We would try to air out the unit and burn incense (note: there is no mesh screen in the security door. It's literally just the frame of the security of the door which kinda doesn't make sense because someone can just reach their hand through and unlock the screen door). Airing out was nearly impossible because we didn't want to leave the front door open and the windows don't open save the small bathroom window.
- Repair work: we were not notified of roofing work on the unit. Our first full day there, we heard sawing, drilling, heavy footsteps on the roof at 8:30am and realized that roofing work was being done on the unit. Ideally there should be no repair work on a unit when guests are staying but if there is, at the very least, inform the guests. Let us know when, what, who, where so we can prepare.
The host was responsive and apologetic but nothing was resolved as the source of the smell was investigated--we just figured out how to mitigate it.
THE HOST
He was nice--it was just an unfortunate circumstance for all involved that soured this stay. He partially refunded (equivalent cost of 1.5 ish days) due to the above issues.
OVERALL
What made this not work for us is resolvable. NOLA is a magical and erratic city that I have visited on a few occasions. The location saved our visit. It was always pleasant to hit the broken pavement (those NOLA streets be cracked and loose and potholed) and meet folks and encounter all the wonderful art and music ever present. I am confident given the above feedback that the host will better communicate with guests by thoughtfully scheduling repair work and now have a better understanding of potential plumbing issues should the stench arise again.
Would I stay here again? Maybe. Would I suggest someone stay here? For the chill and adventurous, given the aforementioned, yes."

Stayed a few nights","Tim’s place is great and would recommended to anyone. First off, it is in a great location. When exploring New Orleans, many think to only roam around the French Quarter, but in my opinion the beauty of the city lies outside of this area. Tim’s place is situated in the Irish Channel, which is about halfway between Uptown and the French Quarter. This makes the city very accessible. It is also only 1-2 blocks from Magazine street, which has many shops, restaurants, and a bus route which is convenient. It is also only several blocks from St. Charles, which has the street car for transportation. The apartment itself is clean, comfortable, traditional shotgun style, and in a safe area. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a local New Orleans experience."

Tim's a great host, easy to communicate with for a no-hassle check in and out, and a very kind accommodation on our last day so we could get in a few more sites and experiences before heading to the airport. The neighborhood is reqlly pleasant, super walkable with a multitude of choices to shop, eat and drink on and off Magazine Street. Also blocks from the buses and trolley to get to the Quarter and around town. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed for five days with my friend for a much-needed girls' trip before Christmas. We were provided with the door code, so check in was a breeze. The owners live in the other half of the house and were proactive about making sure we arrived without any trouble and that we didn't need anything while we were there (we didn't; everything in the house works and it's well outfitted with amenities). The house is beautiful and the owners created a helpful book that shares the home's history and information about the area. The bed was super comfortable and my friend slept well on the sofa bed. Even though the house is just a block from busy Magazine Street, it's very quiet inside. We could have stayed in the neighborhood the entire time with all the nearby shops and restaurants, but we bought a 3-day transit pass and took the St. Charles streetcar into the French Quarter and explored. We had so much fun and are so grateful to have found such a wonderful home away from home."

The family lives in the rest of the house, but it is completely separate. They also didn't make much noise, so we were able to enjoy our stay and get lots of sleep at night. It was easy to book, and easy to make adjustments to the schedule when we needed to shift to another week due to personal schedule conflicts. We were also able to park ride down the side each time we went out. I highly recommend this house. It enhances the NOLA experience."

During the day, you can hear the hustle and bustle of the cars going by, but it was quiet by night, especially from the bedroom. The binder provided was extremely interesting and helpful. Parking on the sides of the streets was sometimes difficult, but we always managed to find a spot. This was a perfect space for two. It was well kept and clean, especially for an older house.

Walking distance to stores and restaurants, and just a few blocks to St Charles Street where you can hop on the trolley and be downtown in 15-20 minutes, or head uptown to the Audubon park and Zoo while taking in the view of all the historic homes along the way.
Quiet, safe and private, even though you’re just a block off bustling Magazine Street!
Definitely recommend"

Stayed a few nights",Tim was very helpful with recommendations and let us leave our luggage early (before check in time). The location was steps away from Magazine Street with many great food options close by. We chose this place because of the reviews and it's proximity to Tulane. It worked very well for me and my daughter! Tim's place was VERY clean which is a high priority for me. We would stay again.

Stayed a few nights","First time staying in the Irish Channel. We loved it. The house was exactly as described. We especially liked the authentic feel of the place. On this trip, we met some friends who had never been to New Orleans before. Their city tour got cancelled, and we invited them to check out our Air BNB and eat at Atchafalaya instead of trying to rebook. I think checking out Tim's shotgun house and reading his guidebook gave them a better taste of NOLA history and culture than a city tour could have done. Plus, it was air conditioned and private: bonus! Most shotgun houses are private residences, so it's rare to be able to see inside one of them. I will pick a place like this over a French Quarter or Central Business District hotel every time I stay in New Orleans."

Tim has a binder full of neighborhood info and recommendations and they go a long way to give us interesting details about the homes history.

I was a little paranoid about my car on the narrow streets, apparently I was the only one concerned, New Orleaners (im pretty sure no one there calls themselves that) know how to navigate their roads, they navigated well during my stay. Not a scratch.
They had me at the handheld shower, I thought I was home."

Stayed a few nights","Get to know New Orleans from your own beautiful 1880s historic shotgun house! So pretty, with the wood floors, high ceilings, well chosen decor, front porch for people watching, and all spotlessly clean!
Tim was very kind in accommodating our early morning/late evening flights and was always very quick to answer questions. I did extensive research but if you didn't, there's a binder full of anything and everything you might want to do in Nola!
The location is PERFECT, can't stress this enough. It's a 2 min walk from an amazing restaurant, Atchafalaya, and Magazine St. is 2 minutes away as well. The gorgeous Garden district is just on the other side, and beautiful to explore on foot. Do yourself a favor when heading to the French Quarter, walk up Louisiana (lined with beautiful homes) 11 minutes to St. Charles and take the lovely old historic tram car! Ubers home were generally $20 or less. The area's really cute, the house itself is a winner (& great water pressure) we had a great stay"

As an able-bodied individual I found the streetcar to be within walking distance, as well as many restaurants, shopping and sightseeing opportunities. A cab/uber to the French Quarter or to Frenchman Street was around $20, and finding the address seemed to be no issue for any of the drivers upon our return each day. I was perfectly happy not having a car staying at this location.
Tim was friendly, helpful and completely responsive. I would definitely stay again!"

Dennis and I could not have been more pleased. On street parking was absolutely marvelous. We always had the ability to park no more than 2-3 spaces from the front door…and most of the time we were able to park ‘right at the front door”. Close parking is truly special for NOLA!
My husband was born and raised in this beautiful city. We found Tim’s rental information binder to be the MOST INFORMATIVE AND WELL THOUGHT OUT Airbnb binder we’ve ever seen. He and his wife undoubtedly put much thought into its creation.. Dennis learned things about NOLA that even he didn’t know. This is a great rental. You will get exactly what you expect here. And that bed is fabulously comfy.
Thank you for having us Tim. We hope to see you again soon. Susan and Dennis"

The neighborhood is quiet and the houses charming, with plenty of street parking in front. Tim’s place is amazing, with 15 foot ceilings, three original fireplaces, beautiful wood floors, and decorated tastefully with great little local culture touches. A full kitchen with anything you need to stay in and cook, a nice coffee bar, and a microwave. The place is also immaculately clean. As a host, Tim was very responsive and helpful in answering our questions. As for value, it was worth every penny. Next time we are in New Orleans, I can only hope it is available again for us.

Well equipped kitchen and laundry facilities - one of the only places on our Road trip where we've found a full sized ironing board to use which was great.
Fantastic location a literal stones throw from Magazine Street, much nicer place than Bourbon street.

Close to everything and the convenience of all the little things he offered with our visit makes this one of the best places we’ve ever stayed.

House is one block from Magazine with a bunch of little restaurants/shops and five blocks walk from the St. Charles/Louisiana streetcar line stop. We really enjoyed our stayed and would definitely recommend!
Major tip for Nola travellers as of 9/28/21! : A city ordinance is currently in place where restaurants require at entrance a proof of vaccine (I.e. card/email proof) or a negative test within the last 72 hrs. Didn't realize this when we came and we didn't bring our cards. We were able to show a picture of our cards or an confirmation email of vaccine appt. as proof though. Just a heads up!"

The AC worked amazingly fast, the washer/dryer was a plus to have in the unit, and I usually always found parking right in front. Even though it’s attached to Tim’s main house I never had an issue with noise and it felt completely private but they were still available if I needed anything.

You can still have plenty of fun on Magazine Street (which is just as close to the listing as described), but are able to avoid the insanity of Bourbon. The place was exactly like the pictures and descriptions, with the addition of an obscenely good guidebook for guests. Book without hesitation if you want a great location, a very clean and comfortable space, and a local taste of New Orleans. A+"

I used to live 4 blocks from his place, and know that it really is such an amazing (and my favorite) neighborhood of New Orleans. The location, cleanliness, thoughtful touches, front porch, coffee, just everything about his rental was perfect. I stayed here with my boyfriend - it was spacious, comfortable, spotlessly clean, and exactly what I had wanted for a trip where we set out mostly on foot each day and enjoyed magazine street and st charles. Tim was very nice and always quick with responses. 10/10. I hope to stay at his place again!"

It’s in the perfect location, super walkable to the French Quarter and many different attractions but away from the craziness and quiet and peaceful at night. It’s also right on the St Charles streetcar line which makes going to the Garden District a breeze. The apartment is also absolutely lovely. Everything was pristine and welcoming when we arrived. The beds were super comfortable and the showers were fantastic. We didn’t use the kitchen but it was modern with every appliance you could need. The amenities in the building (gym and pool) were also nice extras. Check-in was very easy with the keypads on the building and unit. We arrived late at night and left early in the morning and it was clear and easy to get in and out. David was wonderful and communicated so clearly. He also went above and beyond in checking in on us (just in general and in inclement weather). I can’t recommend this place enough for a great stay in New Orleans!"

Stayed a few nights","I booked David's place especially for my parents. The apartment looked better than the listing, the area was great and I do highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give him all 5's was the week we booked, the building had a problem with gas, rendering the stove and oven unusable. David is a great communicator but failed to inform us of this issue before we booked and arrived at his apartment. The gas was not turned back on during our stay, so David was willing to provide a partial refund. We didn't fully agree on the amount, but overall I still believe David is a great host; we just would've preferred a head's up about the non-working kitchen. New Orleans is a foodie city, but it's nice to have the option to cook a bit, if you desire to do so. All in all, I'm sure this was an anomaly, thus, I highly recommend the apartment to anyone visiting."

The details of his unit were described very well and looked like the pictures. My husband and I loved the big walk in shower. Only recommendation is that a bench be added to the shower since it is so huge and was a challenge to shave. Loved the makeup towels that were provided as well. The TV in the living room is amazing. My husband and I would like to recommend eating at Luzianne Cafe and Jack Dempsey restaurant when visiting. Never had shrimp in an omelet until we went to Luzianne Cafe! Next time we make it back to NOLA, we will be staying here again or any of David's other properties!"

Stayed about a week","This is a great Airbnb in many ways but the location in particular sets it apart. Just a few blocks away from the chaos of the Quarter you have a very quiet oasis at the end of the day. Besides the French Quarter, you could easily walk to the convention center, the outlet mall and the many excellent nearby restaurants. Herbsaint, for example, is less than 200 feet away. Too far to walk? The St Charles streetcar line is just outside to door to take you to the Garden District. One block over it runs the other way to the Quarter and connection at Canal to take you to the city park, art museum, sculpture garden, etc. Inside you will find quality linens, comfortable beds and furniture and a very comfortable living area to talk over the day or tomorrows plans over an evening glass of wine. Both a drip coffee maker and Nespresso are available but be prepared to bring along some coffee. This is our seventh trip to NOLA and this is the bast place to stay we have found. We will be back"

Also, it was easy to walk into the French Quarter, which was also about a mile away from us."

The location was far enough away from where all the tourists go but close enough to walk or take the trolley to. The condo itself was spacious, clean, had all the amenities and supplies described, and we immediately felt right at home. The building itself felt quite secure, the lobby was very nice, and there’s a small interior courtyard if you don’t want to relax on the apartment terrace. Host David was very responsive throughout the process, answering questions promptly and offering suggestions when asked. Would definitely recommend staying here - we are looking forward to another visit to NOLA and will definitely try to book this place again."

Stayed a few nights","Wow, wow, and WOW! The photos don’t do this place justice. Extremely clean and spacious.
We came to NOLA to see Beyoncé and retreat for a few days after, and it was terrific. The host gave clear check-in instructions with photos (helpful for a visual person like me), and our flights arrived well after midnight.
The building is very peaceful, which was wonderful for mid-day naps (aka NOLA hangovers, lol). There are lots of excellent food delivery and walkable spots as well. There is a nice view from the balcony, and the fountain outside adds the perfect touch for early morning/evening sitting.
The space can easily sleep everyone comfortably - even couch-sleeping guests. All appliances worked well
and each bathroom was perfectly stocked with towels and toiletries.
Just make yourself at home, follow the house rules, and you will definitely be booking here again.
Overall, 10/10 would recommend!"

The beds were comfortable and linens clean and fresh. Bathrooms well appointed with towels and all the amenities you would expect.
Full kitchen a bonus althouth we didnt cook we could eaaily have prepared meals. Cool chilled water from the fridge was a godsend in the sweltering NOLA heat. The pool was small but a perfect way to refresh after a day of exploring!
We would definitely recommend and stay again if we are in the area again!"

Nice kitchen and living room plus a small balcony. We never used any of the building amenities but the building itself was beautiful and seemed brand new, even the door guy was nice. Rouses Market was only a 4 min walk so it was perfect to grab snacks and drinks for the room. The immediate area was very clean and had several great restaurants. Bourbon Street was about a 10 minute walk so very easy to be in all the excitement. The owner was very responsive and had detailed instructions. I really appreciated not having a chore list for check out (even though we kept it pretty clean). I highly recommend this condo."

Stayed with kids","If you like to be away from it all but in walking distance, I’m from Brooklyn so this is totally subjective, then this is the place for you.
If you want to walk outside the front door and be at the party, then this is not the place for you.
It’s very peaceful, safe, with lots of street parking. There is a parking lot around the corner that we paid on our phone from 10-7, we paid $11 per day. After 7pm, we parked across the street from the building. You choose your own hours to pay for parking. If you choose to park in the building’s parking lot, then it will cost you $28 per day.
We lived in Metairie and split our time between there and New Orleans. I would rent this place again because in New Orleans you can’t play with safety.
The place itself was clean, spacious and peaceful. We got what we wanted but we would have preferred to be in Metairie. That’s our only complaint which is not a real complaint. :)"

Stayed a few nights","If you’re anything like me you’ll scroll through every review but let this one save you some time: BOOK NOW before someone else does! This property is near EVERYTHING. I visited NOLA for Essence Festival & the walk to Canal, Bourbon, & the Super Dome each took less than 15 mins. Ideal location for us to get around on foot (parking was included for our rental). I was apprehensive when the listing mentioned a door man because I wasn’t sure if there’d be issue with us coming in late (essence didn’t end until 2am) BUT all staff were cool, especially Frank! Hosts were extremely helpful in giving check-in info, food recommendations, & directions. They also reached out during my stay to ensure that all was well (through the app so it wasn’t overbearing). The place literally had everything we needed including shot glasses. Lol. It was clean, quiet, & comfortable. Spacious shower & perfect water pressure. OMG the BED: imagine going to heaven for the weekend & sleeping on a cloud!#BOOKASAP"

The condo met all of our expectations. It was very clean with a simple, modern design. The kitchen had a lot of amenities (garbage bags, coffee, dishwasher soap etc...) and was easy to use. The bedrooms were comfortable (with lots of extra pillows in the closet to choose from) and the bathrooms were modern and clean. It was a little lacking in personality (only two pieces of art in the whole place) but made up for it with comfortable furniture and plenty of throw blankets for movie watching. There is a balcony overlooking an inner courtyard which provided a lot of light into the kitchen and living area. The building had a small outdoor pool which our children enjoyed. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I wish I could keep this hidden gem all to myself. Although it is located directly on St. Charles, it's in a quiet part of New Orleans. I arrived during a concert in Lafayette Square (about 20 yards from the front door of the building), and I couldn't hear anything inside the apartment. Neighbors are friendly and quiet. The doormen are great (shoutout to Frank!) and helpful.
The apartment is pristine and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable. The apartment is very quiet internally as well. The walls must be well insulated to dampen sound. I couldn't hear my friend getting ready in the other room. You should have literally everything you need, and if you don't, David and Erika are quick to assist.
You don't really need to leave a three/four black radius when you are there. Rouses and CVS are two blocks north. Great restaurants and bars (Herbsaint, Le Chat Noir, Pluck Wine Bar, Bearcat, Willa Jean) are all within steps. Great stay!"

The bedrooms were also very comfortable, as well as quiet. (Tip - during warm weather, set the thermostat fan to ""on"" to keep warm air from rising to the bedrooms. Much quieter than using the window AC units!)
Everything you need is close by. Lots of great restaurants within easy walking distance, highly recommend Guy's Po-Boys, Apolline, and Superior Seafood & Oyster Bar. Picked up beer and snacks a half block away at Rainbow Grocery.

Stayed a few nights","A very nice ABnB, spacious, in a great location, walkable to many shops/retaurants/bars, 4 large rooms downstairs + kitchen and half bath. The photos do not capture how large the rooms are. Two bedrooms + full bath upstairs. Confortable furniture/beds, very clean, well maintained. Lotta NOLA themed frames on the walls, music-related and festival frames primary for a great NOLA vibe. No worries about the Magazine Street location, it's a decently trafficed street, but very quiet inside the house, the bedrooms are in the back, and you can't hear the street. Being on Magazine Street is a bonus, great restaurants, bars and shops in short walking distance, such a great NOLA showcase street without the tourist throngs of the French Quarter. Over 4 days, never had a problem finding a parking spot out front. Megan/Jonathan live next door - while they were quick to respond to contacts, they were very respectful of our privacy. This is high value stay at a decent price."

Loved the front porch but more to watch the world go by, Magazine is an active area. Bedrooms are near the back of the house so peaceful nights."

Stayed a few nights","This home was perfect for our NOLA vacation! The place was spotless, the decor was fun and stylish, and the kitchen was well stocked. We were in awe of the super tall ceilings both upstairs and down, and the house had lots of character and unique touches. The bedrooms were both really nice (no fighting over the better room!) and they are set back from the street so we didn't hear any road noise. The stairs to the bedrooms were a little skinny and steep but didn't bother us at all. There were lots of shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance, and the Magazine bus (1/2 block) and streetcar (6 blocks) both conveniently run straight to the French Quarter. Check-in was easy and the hosts who live next door were very friendly, responsive, and provided some great recommendations. All in all this place was fantastic and we would definitely stay here again."

The house is decorated with class and style.
The neighborhood was very interesting, with so many lovely antique houses, shops, restaurants, cafes, and friendly bars enticing me to explore.
Audubon Park, which is a short drive or a nice walk away, was grand and lovely with it's majestic live oak trees, some having been planted in the late 16th century.
I would hope to stay with these hosts again on any future visit to New Orleans."

we did not have any problems; asked the host once or twice for information and if we could stay a bit longer the day we were meant to fly home, as our flight was pushed back a few hours. very kindly they allowed us to stay into the early afternoon. i would go back in a flash —maybe next year!"

The downstairs portion of the home is decorated so well and is very comfortable. The house is a bit dated and in need of some updates in terms of the bathrooms and kitchen, however it is an old home and with those come different expectations! It’s an historic shot gun home, so you may need to adjust your expectations and needs especially if traveling with small children (the stair case is extremely tall and steep and the upstairs hallway is very narrow). You can hear and feel the neighbors walk around in the other half of the house, so also something to consider with little ones. All in all a nice place to stay in a great location."

Stayed about a week","This is a gem of an Airbnb. The location is really good - so many yummy restaurants and cute shops nearby. We also took a bunch of walks and found ourselves mesmerized by the architecture nearby. There is a small mostly fenced in yard in the front and a large mostly fenced in shared yard in the back that our dog loved. The house itself has a lot of character, as a typical shotgun camelback, and great thoughtful touches. Everything you need for cooking, a dishwasher, a desk to do work at, comfy couch, and really cool furniture. Megan was also very responsive and lives just next door if there are any issues! Overall, this was a great find and I would recommend it."

Stayed with kids","Megan’s place is awesome! Easy check in, super clean, and lots of extra sheets, blankets, and towels. The stairs are very steep, as she mentions. They are also very narrow. There is a central AC unit downstairs, but only two small window units upstairs. The full bath takes a bit of work and time to get cool, but it wasn’t a big problem. Just keep that in mind if renting during the hot summer months!
Excellent location!! Walkable to so many good places and there is a small market right on the corner just steps away!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely top notch! Megan's place is the place to stay if you're looking to experience and fall in love with New Orleans!
To start, the house is located on Magazine St. which is a wonderful avenue full of shops and eateries. But, because it is not located in the middle of the hustle and bustle, it is a quieter retreat amongst mature trees and within walking distance of activity and excitement. Parking was absolutely no issue. Further, the house is a true gem! If you want to experience a historical camelback shotgun house, Megan's is the one! The front of the home has a lovely porch for relaxing at any time of the day. Inside, Megan has decorated the space in such a classy and functional manner that it was frankly hard to choose whether we enjoyed staying inside or outside! The bedrooms were comfortable as well, which was fantastic after long days of exploring. Megan was even nice enough to leave coffee, beverages, and a frozen pizza! Finally, we were able to bring our pups along with us! The front porch/garden is gated which allowed us to hang out without having to leash our dogs and the house is within walking distance from a dog park and many dog friendly restaurants.
Megan's place is truly 5 stars all around from location, to comfort, to some thoughtful personal touches... absolutely second to none. We hope to stay here many more times to come!"

Although we didn’t do any cooking (the food scene in New Orleans is pretttty good ;), there is a spacious kitchen and a dining room to accommodate a family or large group. Megan’s place is in a great location, with several bars, restaurants and shops in walking/biking distance, and she provided excellent recommendations. But wait, there’s more - she’s also responsive and very kind.
I absolutely recommend staying in her beautiful space if you find yourself in need of a place to stay in that magical city!"

Nicely renovated, really comfy bed, and still a very private feel for being part of the other house. Catherine was very responsive to any questions we had as well. The location was excellent as well. Just a few blocks from the trolly line to get into French Quarter, and plenty of restaurants and stores. A bonus was a daily visit from the neighborhood cat, Hapsburg. He was the best! We definitely will be staying here again in the future!"

And we always felt safe walking back late at night. Catherine was an amazing host with attention given to anything we might need. She had the unit ready with AC on when we arrived.

You could easily spend a weekend only walking around and eating within the Garden District and have a great time. It's pretty easy to get to downtown or the French Quarter by public transportation and it's very affordable to get there by rideshare. The street is well lit and even during the weekdays there's a fair amount of foot traffic. So we felt safe walking around after dark. All in all, I would absolutely book this unit again!"

You basically have the whole back part of the house to yourself--two floors, so there's no noise from anyone above, and a private side entrance. Very private and secure. Cute and sunny back patio, frequently visited by a friendly cat. I ate all my breakfasts out there in the sunshine. One block from trendy Magazine street. Easy to get everywhere on foot. The decor is very classy: hardwood floors, crisp white linens, nice furniture, good lighting. Hosts are extremely friendly and respond immediately to questions. They give you your privacy as well.

Commanders Palace is a short walk, and just walking around the Garden District is a lovely way to spend any part of your day.
The loft style bedroom was a great way to separate the sleeping area from the rest of the suite. The linens were of beautiful quality, as were the towels, dishes, and glassware.
Catherine is incredibly responsive, accommodating, and kind. She was able to supply us with a small freezer (I’m a nursing mom) and even left a sweet gift for our little one. If we find ourselves back in NOLA, we will most certainly ask to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Stay here!! Staying here was the BEST decision we made. It was exactly as described and pictured. We were able to find it easily and Catherine was quick to respond to any question we had (literally within a few minutes).
Positives: Safe place to park our car- right in front, 8-min. walk to the St. Charles street car pick-up (with a Starbucks on the way) which we took to the WW2 museum and Canal Street, about a block away from the Garden District, and most importantly is that we felt completely safe to walk around during the day and at night.
Cons: None. There was nothing we found to be negative about our stay. We will absolutely stay here again!"

I’ve stayed at quite a few Airbnb’s and her’s has been the best. 10/10. All the places we made reservations at happened to be walking distance from her place, great location. She gave us recommendations prior to our trip and was extremely accommodating to our schedule. I wouldn’t hesitate to book it again."

In terms of the actual AirBnB, it was pristine. Everything was clean, well organized, and the furniture was clean. The space was aesthetically pleasing. The downstairs had a large TV that I used to rest before heading back out to explore Nola or from my conference.
The bed was comfortable, lots of pillows, and covers. It is located above the living room through an accessible staircase.
The space as plenty of light fixtures, fans, and access to upstairs and downstairs A.C.
Last but not least, Catherine went ABOVE and BEYOND for me as a host and helped me the n night before my flight. I cannot recommend this place more!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a gem of a place! It is small but feels spacious. And it is sooo quiet! There was some construction going on in the area but it was very muted in the rental. It was my first airb&b stay, and as a senior woman on her own, I felt very secure here. Catherine was very responsive with pointers on transportation and dining (and how to use the lock system on the door and run the cooling system). I was appreciative of the two air temp systems. My son’s family stayed at a lovely established French Quarter hotel for 4 nights that never had working air conditioning!
Magazine Street is nearby and the whole neighborhood features some of the lovely architecture New Orleans is known for. I wish I had had more leisure time to spend meandering. I had a very busy schedule of wedding-related events and the host’s extra-considerate provisions of water, snack bars, coffee (with half and half—important!) and protein shakes kept me going before the Uber arrived to sweep me away. I did go out and get some delicious local Greek food on my first night.
I would highly recommend this host!"

Stayed a few nights","11/10 - this space that Catherine has created deserves the HIGHEST rating!! It is incredibly clean, comfortable, and thoughtful. The complete perks of a hotel (coffee and snacks provided, bathroom stocked, comfy towels, plenty of pillows on the bed (a pet peeve of mine when you only get two… Catherine sets you up with 6) etc etc), but also, it is nested in the most charming NOLA location (literally right off the iconic magazine street and steps from gorgeous, picturesque homes throughout the garden district… there’s also French Truck Coffee right across the street, several restaurants nearby, and the St. Charles streetcar which is not only historical, but will take you right into the French Quarter for way less than your Uber). The suite has a super easy keypad check-in, so there’s no need to carry keys with you throughout the day. Catherine is also very communicative, and makes sure you’re very comfortable during your stay. Needless to say, Catherine’s guest suite checked all the boxes for me! It’s only a matter of when I will be back for my next visit!! 💜💛💚"

They made our stay very comfortable. As natives, they had many helpful suggestions on restaurants etc. In my opinion this AirBnb could not be located in a better place in New Orleans! You are very close to a bustling part of Magazine St. with all it's antique/vintage shops, cute boutiques, restaurants and coffee houses. It is (6) blocks from the St. Charles Streetcar line which will take you either uptown or downtown towards the CBD (Center Business District), Warehouse District, and French Quarter. The guest suite itself is very comfortable, quiet, clean and newly renovated. It has it's own back entrance so you don't feel you're disrupting the homeowners as you come and go from the suite."

They also have adorable neighbors, so if you plan to be a pest, stay elsewhere. Theirs were gracious of having strangers go in and out as we needed. Safe and easy to find and access.
The place itself is super clean and feels on the hotel side of things meaning they provide fluffy towels, coffee and waters. Small touches made it much better than a hotel of course. Book and see for yourself. Catherine was easy to get a hold of when we needed anything and made us feel welcome. Definite find for my husband and I who will be coming back. Thanks Catherine!"

Stayed a few nights","Robert was an all star host. He was immediately responsive anytime I required assistance. The place was in a great location a few blocks from the French Quarter, but still was quite and felt very safe walking home late at night and leaving our car parked in front. There was water to drink and some snacks available for getting home late after a long night on the Quarter. The restaurants within one block were all great, a coffee shop with ice cream, and a spot for bloody marys and brunch with great yelp reviews and quality dishes.
The place was even more roomy than in the photos. Which was a nice surprise. It has a kitchen, bathroom, master and then two more rooms with couches if more space is needed. The quality of the place itself was not perfect, a bit old feeling, but for the price it can't be beat, which is why it averages out to five stars in my opinion."

We enjoyed walking around the nieghborhood and to French Quarter. We are not fancy people and Robert's place wasn't fancy - so it seemed like a great fit and it was! Both sofas and bed were comfortable, it is simply decorated and cute and had EVERYTHING one might want (who wants a stove on vacation?). He is clearly a generous human being as he had drinks, snacks, toiletries, etc. galore! Oh, and enough towels for a baseball team!
If I ever go to New Orleans again (and 1 bed is enough) I will book here again for sure!"

Stayed one night","Very nice stay at Robert's place just a couple blocks from Frenchman street.
The place is very nice and ideally located.
Didn't meet Robert directly but we very easily communicated with him.
Robert even refunded us the first night we had to cancel last minute because of a missed flight while airbnb cancel policy didn't force him to.
Very nice host!
I definitely recommend"

Stayed one night","Never having been to New Orleans, researching location was challenging and I wondered right up until arrival if I had made the right choice. Robert's place worked out to have the perfect balance of walking distance to everything but just enough distance to be a quiet neighborhood to stay in. I walked the distance and If you graphed the French Quarter from The East (Robert house) to the West (Hotels and high rises) it's a steady slope from peaceful to chaos. The neighborhood felt safe and I had no problem parking out front, day or night. Inside the ""shotgun duplex"" is a uniquely wonderful structure transitioning from room to room without hallways. Tastefully decorated and comfortable from couches to beds that were all in great shape. The kitchen was set up nicely and the full size coffee maker was a treat. The place oozes with charm. Don't pass this one up."

Robert is a hospitality professional and deeply ingrained in his community, and his home shows off both these qualities. The stay is a 4-room shotgun-style house with two living areas, one bedroom, and a full kitchen (except for stove). It is clean, charming, and quiet. The home has multiple options for cooling with many fans and AC. The location is a quick walk both from the French Quarter and Bywater - with this home base, you can see everything a visitor would want to see on foot. Robert was a great host, his home is wonderful - you should stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","Robert has the very best location one could ask for. It is just a short walk to Frenchmen St. and about 15 minutes to Bourbon St. It is located in a quiet neighborhood so you will sleep restfully, and there are several wonderful options for brunch in the neighborhood that offer outdoor seating.
The Kind bed is super comfy and the home is very clean and safe. I look forward to staying at Robert's place again soon."

Stayed about a week","Robert’s place is extremely clean and comfortable! A perfect location; you can enjoy a leisurely stroll to the French Quarter in just 15 minutes. A quiet neighborhood allows for a peaceful night’s sleep. Go to the Royal Frenchmen hotel for the best happy hour with 5 dollar cocktails. There is a fantastic Thai restaurant one block away, and Small Mart has the best bagels for breakfast!"

This might be the best stocked rental we have ever stayed. Toiletries, snacks, water. Plenty of towels, sheets, etc.
Robert is friendly and a great host!"

Stayed a few nights","Robert is a fabulous host. His place is roomy, clean, and cozy. The outdoor patio was my favorite because it is like a jungle back there; plus, you hear a constant waterfall in the background. The location was perfectly convenient to my preferences and the neighborhood is quaint and beautiful. You will not regret this! Oh, and he had everything one could possibly need in the home from drinks to medicine to Lysol wipes to party favors. The bed sheets were super soft!! Thanks Robert!
P. S. - About a 15-20 min walk to the quarter. Not bad! also, don’t be surprised to see cats hanging around. But don’t worry, they don’t bother you or get close."

Stayed a few nights","OMG... Don't let the simple appearance of the outside of this little White House fool ya... it is fantastic! Very close to a coffee shop and a market... within Walking distance to the French Quarter a d Bourbon street... so close enough to the parties, Yet quiet and relaxing. My friend and I(both females) were traveling together and at no time felt unsafe.
It felt much more like staying at a friend's house that staying at a hotel! It has so much character...
Do yourself a favor and venture into the back yard! It was like a surprising paradise back there.
If I ever go back to NOLA... Robert's place will certainly be my first choice!!! I highly recommend!"

In easy walking distance to Frenchman street where there is live music, art, and great food! About a 15-20 minute walk into the French Quarter as well. The house was beautiful- clean and comfortable! We loved that the kitchen had plates, silverware, coffeemaker etc- it helped us to save a little money and enjoy a few meals in during our stay. There was also a lush backyard with a nice sitting area. I highly recommend staying here, especially if you enjoy walking/ biking around while you travel- perfect location to do so!"

Stayed one night","Robert was a wonderful, responsive host who went above and beyond . He welcome me when I arrived and took the time to chat with me a number of times during my 1 day visit. When I had questions about the apartment he responded immediately.
Most importantly after leaving and halfway to the airport I sheepishly realized I'd lost my coat & keys running for the bus. Robert graciously found them for me (in the middle of the street!), met me at the bus stop when I got back, and waited with me for the bus to return even though it was rather chilly out.
Because of Robert and his fabulous apartment I had the opportunity to relax and unwind after an intense business meeting and had a happy ending to what could have been a disastrous trip."
