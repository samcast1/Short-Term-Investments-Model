The host did come to try to fix the issue but for some reason, even though the thermostat was set at 70, the heat only came on intermittently and often blew cool air. We should have stayed at a hotel."

Besides those minor things, loved the stay!"

I always struggled either branding the bank on a hotel or feeling like I’m being a burden at friends places every time I go to CT to visit my daughter. His unit was affordable, clean, looked like it was recently renovated and close to many coffee spots and restaurants. I grew up in BPT so the crowd around downtown doesn’t bother me.
Thank you Ricardo, I appreciate your accommodations and trust."

Stayed a few nights","My daughter and I traveled from Vietnam and first time going to Connectcut for her school onboarding, we had a week staying at Andrew's apartment. He is a great host, very supportive and very quick to response. The guides for self-checking in were clear, sufficient and super easy to get through.
We really like his apartment, nice decoration, full facilities, comfortable. Particularly, my daughter loved Alexa.
Staying in Andrew's apartment was realling giving us feeling of home away from home. We did appreaciate that.
Regarding the communication, even though we did not have chance to see each other in person, I did always have prompt and helpful responses and from Andrew. The communication was great.
Thanks Andrew and his co-host for giving us such a great experience.
I definitely recommend his place to others."

Stayed one night","Andrew and Lara’s space is a fantastic place to stay. The entire space has a great, modern design that feels like a vacation home rental. The space is spotless and provides comforts like a huge TV in the bedroom, coffee, numerous towels, soap/shampoo dispenser, and even a bidet. The space is beautiful and functional. I can’t vouch enough for Andrew and Lara as hosts. Even though we rarely saw them during our stay, they took extra steps to accommodate our travel schedule, get us situated, and make sure we were comfortable. This was the best stay I’ve had through Airbnb."

Communication was clear, and they always responded quickly. We stayed here for a concert, and it was inexpensive, and the area was lined with plenty of restaurants. The only think I would have future visitors keep in mind is that you can hear footsteps above, and at times, muffled talking. This location is a converted space in their home. It is VERY well done and affordable. We were not bothered, whatsoever, by any of this. Overall, it was a comfortable stay, and I would encourage you to select this space for your future stay."

Stayed a few nights","Nice, clean, nearly perfect stay with a couple of notes:
- Bathroom sink water had a weird taste
- The provided blinds on the entry way door leave a large gap where someone from the outside can see directly into the bed. I know it’s a private property and that’s highly unlikely, but it’d be nice to know I can have total privacy when I’m sleeping.
Aside from that, a great little spot for a solo or couple traveling to stay."

The open floor plan gave us plenty of room for our suitcases. We appreciated the water and the snacks left in the kitchen. We were not familiar with the radon gas detector in the basement wall, but Linfield (co-host) was able to quickly answer our questions about the device. We both had a good night's sleep on the comfortable bed. We did not meet Colette, but met Linfield as we were leaving in the morning. We felt that the apartment was a good value and would recommend it to others."

Bridgeport is a very residential area and close to Coletee's is plenty of EXCELLENT food options. The Jamaican place right nearby was fantastic.

Stayed about a week","This Loft in Black Rock is amazing. This was our 1st AirBNB experience and it was superb!
Jim & Marina are consummate hosts. Their property is immaculate and beautiful.
The Loft is a homage to rock & roll. Jim personally built it & the details to music are incredible.
The kitchen and bathroom are downstairs & well-stocked. The bed is very comfortable and the furniture, cozy.
Right outside your door is a beautiful built-in pool & patio with a covered grill.
There is ample parking on the property.
Black Rock is a historic, artsy neighborhood. It is quiet and pretty. There are tons of restaurants & bars and gift shops...all walkable.
You MUST walk along LI Sound at St Marys, have coffee at The Harborview, eat breakfast at The Tasty Yolk (the ""Pig"" sandwich is unbelievable!), dine at BRYAC, lunch at Hub n Spoke, shop at BR Vintage (David is awesome), the Pious Bird, BR Dept Store. H&H Latin bakery is delicious. Enjoy music at Park City Music Hall... fantastic vacation spot"

We had a terrific stay, one of the best AIRBNBs that we have ever visited. Here are some of the highlights:
* Easy check in, combination lock to unit was convenient
* Safe area, many fun attractions withing walking distance
* Local parks and even a dog-friendly beach was only a few blocks away
* Jim took the time to reach out by sending notes on events going on in the area
* Large back yard with amazing pool and patio area was super enjoyable
* Layout of unit was great with kitchen and entertainment on lower level, with bedrooms upstairs
* We really enjoyed the music theme of the unit and the many CDs and LPs that were available
* Local cuisine and brewery options exceeded our expectations, make sure you visit BRYAC!
* Jim and Marina were very friendly and engaging and made us feel very comfortable during our stay
* Comfortable bed and lots of dressers
We can't recommend this unit highly enough. A+++ AIRBNB!!"

Tucked behind the beautiful main house, the space the rear and upstairs of the large garage. A lovely yard, pool and deckare right outside the door.
The kitchen and bath are both located on the first floor (no stove in the kitchen, but a microwave and toaster oven.)
Upstairs is a beautiful open loft, with plenty of seating, musical instruments, great music choices, and a super comfy bed.
Black Rock Bridgeport is a magical beach communty, with peaceful walking options, and also resturants and nightlife. I highly recommend!!"

Jim and his wife were both very welcoming and had the best restaurant recommendations. Everything is exactly as pictured and described. They did a great job blocking out sunlight on the top floor so you can sleep in comfortably. No curtains on the main entrance door on the bottom floor which faces the pool/yard area so just be wary since it’s right in-front of the bathroom. They do rent out another Airbnb in their main house so the backyard area is a shared space, but we were lucky to have it to ourselves for the majority of our stay. Would recommend!"

The upstairs large TV area feels like a private screening room and it was so fun having another large TV in the kitchen too. There is something so grounding about having a great collection of records to play too. It was great to have an upstairs and downstairs that we could both work and take calls in separate spaces as needed. There is a dishwasher, microwave, counter top oven and powerful two-up hot plate that does the trick for cooking. Tons of food delivery options too. Everything you might need is super close by, including a Whole Foods. There are many small touches throughout that feel thoughtful and make things more comfortable. The shower has a floor made of smooth large pebbles and it feels nice to stand on. Heat works great in January! Jim is very responsive. We want to come back in the summer!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is beautiful! Jim has done an amazing job of setting it up, and the effect when you in is jaw-dropping.
It’s cozy yet spacious (more spacious than it looks in the photos, even!) and all the furniture is super comfortable.
Black Rock is a quiet, adorable gem of a town, and the gorgeous fall colors are not to be missed. This place is an ideal getaway for recouping your mental sanity, and close enough to the City that you can lose it again quickly if you need/want!"

Didn’t have a chance to check out the in-ground pool, but looks perfect for summer stays. Jim communicated well and I was very satisfied all around. This space is worth the price. Looking forward to returning in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","The photos of the space are excellent but the apartment is even better in person. It’s big, cosy and immaculate, with an awesome pool right outside. We had a great time here and it’s such a quick and easy getaway from NYC that we plan on coming back next summer. We used a car service so didn’t have a car during our stay but most places were walkable and Uber is readily available if needed. Jim and Rina are also the most lovely hosts and we spent our last night outside by the pool chatting away with them. Definitely can’t say enough good things! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at this location was nothing short of spectacular. The space has a modern-vintage look, it’s a lot more spacious than what the pictures lead on. We were able to use the pool and backyard as we liked. Jim was a very hospitable host and responded very quickly to any questions or concerns we had. He really does go out of his way to make you feel comfortable and at home, but also does not intrude on your privacy. There are restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, and fast food areas within walking distance. You can also drive to an escape the room location, bowling alley, zip lining, kayaking, and the aquarium (the aquarium was lots of fun)! I had a great time and would most likely come again. Thank you Jim!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place to stay, Jim has worked hard to present a stylish but cosy space with plenty of room! We love the decor, the cottage has the real feel of a music studio with album covers and a music corner with vinyl collection! The pool is just a few steps from the front door - a total treat this August.
Jim and his fiancé were on site for anything we needed, and gave us plenty of tips for exploring the area! Very friendly and relaxing atmosphere around the property. We are hoping to go back again!
Great location for exploring the local coastal area and some great spots within a short drive, the house is also walking distance from some nice bars and restaurants, and there is a large supermarket nearby."

Stayed a few nights","I truly don't think you'll find a better place to stay if you are a simple traveler visiting this area solo or with one other person. It's everything you'd get in a hotel except better. The neighborhood was easy to find and if it hadn't been downpouring, I would have felt very safe running there as a woman. The accomodations look exactly like the pictures. The little kitchen setup exceeded expectations (coffee, little fridge with water etc, snacks!, a table to eat at). Plus the whole place smells nice. Oh also the shower is beautiful and after a day in the rain was so perfect to warm up. M even checked in on me after the first day. All around a great stay. FYI there is a little space heater next to the television. I missed it the first night (I was tired) but turned it on briefly the second night and it's a powerhouse. If I ever need to come to CT again, I hope M's place is available."

Hot clean shower. Comfortable temperature inside, and with an air purifier and extra heater if needed. Plenty of parking on the street just out front. And excellent communication from Mansoor throughout the stay. It’s so turnkey though, that you don’t really need to ask for anything. I would absolutely stay here again, and recommend it highly."

Stayed one night","My husband and I had a great 1 night stay. This was a step up from a hotel room and we payed less! The pillows and bed were very comfortable. The big win was the bowl of candy, Oreos and free soda!! Getting into the apartment in the dark was a little tricky, we figured it out eventually though. It was the door out back through the side gate that leads to the apartment. We got in late and didn't interact with the host. The door between the up floor and the place we stayed in is thin enough that we could hear clearly upstairs conversation and movement so not much different from a hotel room. We were on west coast time so we watched a movie and hoped it wasn't too loud for those upstairs. The ceiling was low in some places but my husband who's 5'11 Didn't have any problems but someone taller might. It was a decent stay for the price."

All things that matter to me when staying away from home. I’d definitely stay here again!"

Polita was super responsive to all messages and letting me know what to do for check in and check out. All in all a great stay and would reccomand the location to others ."

Stayed a few nights","The stay was fantastic! Polita made an effort and beyond to make us feel welcomed. We loved that the place was spotless, the linens were all fresh and clean. The closets, floors, furnishings, fixtures, and dresser were all new looking or freshly painted. Plenty of places to plug things in, there was even a small end table in the living area that had two USB ports on it.
The stove, dishwasher, and refrigerator were all new looking and functional.
A huge bonus was that there was a washer and dryer right there! So don’t forget to bring some Tide Pods and some dryer sheets with you.
Parking was a slight issue, but Polita was able to quickly make it work for us!
Overall, a wonderful experience and if I’m ever in the area again, I will not hesitate to return."

Lol who fumigate monthly but never had an issue? I was trying to be a good guest told her let’s get some trap and deal with it she said she’ll look into and never did. When I asked about it the second time she upped the rates of the rental. And claimed to be taking a loss. Worst Airbnb rental I’ve ever had.

Stayed one night","Many things in this home gives a “work in progress” or unfinished look: 1) TV missing in master bedroom with hardware remaining 2) Dark blue paint patches on the wall 3) Missing faceplates 4) Semi-remodeled bathroom, but the radiator looks old/dirty & new caulking would help.
Would love to see cotton sheets available rather than polyester. There were no top sheets, only a fitted sheet & comforter. The 2nd bedroom only had two decorative shams on each twin bed. My friend slept on hers & I borrowed a pillow from the master bedroom.
The neighborhood is a mix of homes that are kept up & homes that look depressed.
We enjoyed the nearby Brazilian restaurant. The couch was cute & comfortable. The basket on the counter with wine, extra toothbrushes & small soaps was a nice touch.
We felt that the cost was too high ($300 all in) in mid May compared to the other lovely places we stayed for the same price. This place has potential. We wish this family all the best in their business."

Stayed one night","First off, Ivette was very kind and always responded to messages right off.
If you’re not from the area (we are not) you are in a city. There’s noise. There’s neighbors above you. You will hear them. It’s a little “rough” neighborhood. (Didn’t bother us too much) the pictures didn’t show the cosmetic issues with the bathroom. The internet didn’t connect. We couldn’t watch the tv at all. (We also didn’t message Ivette about this) wasn’t a big deal to us. It was clean. The queen bed was comfortable. She left travel size soaps, shampoo, and toothpaste. And a bottle of wine. Very nice. I think the price was a little steep for what the place was. But it worked for our sleeping quarters for 1 night. Thanks again Ivette for being so kind and letting us use your home."

There was also no microwave. There were a lot of noises throughout the day/night from the upstairs neighbors as well. Communication was great, only if there were better amenities."

The description was spot on, the home comfortable (bed was EXCELLENT!), washer and dryer a blessing, and instructions for check-in and check-out super easy and accurate). I walked into an immaculate little reprieve while in Fairfield to work on my late mother's estate and I will definitely be staying here each time I travel to Fairfield. Cannot recommend it highly enough for others who are looking in this area, too!"

Stayed a few nights","Victoria's place is exactly what an airbnb should be - homey, comfortable, with all the amenities you'd have if staying with family or friends. All the little details were accounted for: decent knives, containers, etc. for food prep; stocked essentials like olive oil, vinegar, coffee (decaf and regular!); GOOD shampoo/conditioner/soap/facewash/laundry detergent; pen/post-its/scissors; perfect list of recommendations for eating, etc.; mattress was comfy with soft & cozy linens. We were even welcomed with a selection of fresh food staples that were so appreciated! The space is well maintained and lovingly cleaned - someone is paying attention to all the nooks & crannies - including the oft missed spaces like baseboards, drawers & ceiling corners. Loved my stay. Would definitely rent again."

Stayed a few nights","Well-designed and clean basement apartment in a quiet, safe, walkable neighborhood. Everything we needed was provided. Bed was very comfortable. All directions and instructions were clear. All in all, a nice Airbnb at a good price. The only downside is that the walls and floors are thin, and there’s little separation, so we heard everything going on in the house above. It kept us up on our first night. It wasn’t a party or anything like that, but still distracting. If it weren’t for the noise issue we’d happily stay there again."

Since my wife and I visit Fairfield often and stay a week or so, we look for attractive small apartments in nice neighborhoods with a comfortabke bedroom, bathroom, working kitchen, washer/dryer, TV and WiFi and convenient to shopping and restaurants, Given its demographics, the supply of those is limited in Fairfield, qnd Victoria’s is one of the few! And it comes with a sensible price and a friendly, helpful hostess! Highly recommended."

Downtown Bridgeport seemed a bit desolate, but the area is private and quiet, just what we were looking for. I would highly recommend The Adventure Park at the Discovery Museum if you stay here!"

The construction is on the other side of the wall that the bed is on. It started around 8am both days I was here. Enjoyed my time in the space otherwise. Thank you, Anna."

My next stay in Bridgeport will definitely be with Anna!!

Stayed with a pet",Came to Bridgeport for a concert at the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater which was literally a straight 5 minute walk from this airbnb! Stayed with my pup who felt comfy being left alone. Host was awesome and had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. Warm and cozy unit! Easy parking and Ubers had no problem picking us up/ dropping us off. Overall had a great time!!! Dinner at Paci which was a quick drive away and multiple breweries around. Seaside park which was also walking distance/short drive gave us nice sunsets! Will def book again if I’m in the area again. Thank you so much for your hospitality!!! 🤍

Stayed with a pet","Michael and Anna’s place is lovely! My husband and I stayed there two weeks in the midst of a move overseas and the apartment had all the comforts of home, such as stocked towels, linens, essentials for cooking and cleaning. We walked Seaside Park nearly every day and celebrated my husband’s birthday at Brewport up the road. We spent a few days at Jennings Beach, a short drive away. Staying at the apartment long-term without a car may be tricky, there aren’t many convenience stores or large grocery shops, but the larger Bridgeport area isn’t more than a 10-minute Uber away. One can tell that M & A care a lot about their guests, just by the conveniences they provide. We would stay there again, if given the opportunity."

Not only was the place super adorable, but it had everything you could possibly need - full kitchen, roku for streaming, games, toiletries, throw blankets, etc. Plus the location was great, there were no issues with finding parking, its walkable to the amphitheater and some great restaurants, and everything else we wanted to do was a 10 minute drive or less. Michael and Anna also went above and beyond as hosts, we accidentally left a shirt in the closet and less than two hours after we checked out they had sent us a message letting us know and offering to send it. Would definitely stay there again (and hope to)!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at this Airbnb during our trip down the CT coast. The studio was well put together and had everything we needed for a few nights away. It was super clean and nicely designed. We really loved how close it was to the seaside park and path, and the coastal downs down south were fairly accessible from the studio. The property is a lower unit so you do hear a good bit of sounds from the upper unit so maybe not the best if you’re sensitive to noise. Being a lower unit in the winter, we found it chilly even with the baseboard on. Not a dealbreaker but wise to be mindful of. The host was responsive, communicative, and flexible which I appreciated."

Stayed over a week","Really enjoyed my stay - this was a temporary housing solution as my partner and I were relocating to Bridgeport. Location was quiet, safe & literally across the street from the beach! Morning walks with my dog next to the beach were our favorite! We had everything we needed for cooking, sleeping and entertainment. It is a studio, so small space, but it was perfectly fine for myself, my boyfriend and our dog Athena.
The only complaint I would have is the wifi connection - I work from home in a heavy meeting based work culture and I would tend to lag out or lose connection every few hours, but it wasn't something I couldn't work around.
Michael was very communicative whenever anything was going on with troubleshooting or if the internet was going to be out of commission. They also offer a complimentary cleaning service weekly - we opted out of this option, but it's there!
All in all, I would recommend Michael's studio as a great place to stay."

Everything inside the house was available, labeled and easy to use, so you never felt like you were searching for how to make things work. But in any case, Dylan is very responsive and thoughtful, and even let us stay a bit later before checking out.

Some spaces could’ve been a little cleaner but Dylan was very responsive and accommodating. He provided great instructions on how to utilize the home equipment."

Stayed with kids","Perfect getaway! Home: spotless, very inviting, thoughtful touches like having the kitchen stocked with the tools you needed and plenty of it. Also things were labeled so no time wasted fiddling with things. Beds were very comfortable. Bedding and towels we soft and nice. Hot tub was a plus. Surroundings: My son had fun tossing the ball and fishing across the street. Neighborhood was quiet. We were close to many things to do and visit and eat at but not smack in the middle of things which made for a relaxing time. Host: very friendly and responsive when we reached out with questions. Overall the place was perfect for my family (2 teens). Checking in and Out was the easiest we have ever experienced. Host said pets were allowed which could have been disastrous with my allergies but I was perfectly fine and the house smelled fresh and clean."

I will note that there are two pretty steep flights of stairs to climb, so if you have mobility issues or difficulty climbing stairs, this may not be the best place for you to stay. As I'm young and healthy, it was not a issue for me. My older mother, on the other hand, would struggle. Just a head's up.
It was a great place and I would certainly stay here again."

The only thing that took away a star unfortunately was the other guest. Since this bnb is a shared space you sometimes may come in contact with other guest that may not be the best and this is for any bnb. The guests in one of the other rooms did not keep the bathroom clean and this was at no fault of the host but maybe can be emphasized in the description or messages at check in to keep common spaces clean and to know incase someone else is using it.
Overall host, location, room was amazing and I will return here if I’m the area!"

Stayed one night","Overall we were pleased with the room and the photos matched! If your looking to go out in the area I would not recommend but it’s great for a night.
Location: There is not much to do in the area but, it’s right next to the water. We felt safe but the outside appearance was not the best
Pros : The pictures matched 100%, the bathroom and room was spotless and the bed was SUPER comfy and cozy. There was a coffee maker with tea and coffee as well as cold water bottles in the fridge
Cons: Upon arrival when we entered we noticed someone was sleeping in our assigned room. We contacted the host and he promptly had someone come up. They advised us we could have the other room as they were in ours…..in most cases I wouldn’t have been happy but the room was larger than what we booked. Unfortunately due to the mix up we only had one large towel and a number of smaller ones."

Mini fridge, microwave, and fan in private room. There is a Chipotle 4 min away and I think there was a Walmart in the area. Airbnb is conveniently off highway but the area doesn’t feel perfectly private and safe but it is fair for the economic price. Would consider staying again as it was the cheapest option with good ratings :)"

Stayed one night",Alejandro’s place was truly a sweet spot. Being on the third floor gave us a great view in the morning. Alejandro was also very communicative and willing to help out with last minute changes. Our visit seamless as we got in late but fell right asleep. Privacy was great. Bathroom and shower were AMAZING! Would definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights",Listing was close to many restaurants and our concert which was good. The room was nice but I didnt realize the bathroom was shared with two other airbnb rooms upstairs. The cleaning service that came in was very loud talking which woke us up after long flights. There was no trashbags to throw away any trash in the bathroom or in the room

Stayed one night","Pros: Nice remodeled room and bathroom. This is the cleanest shared bathroom I have seen at an AirBNB! Plenty of parking on the street. Clean. Great value.
Cons: The door code provided to us did not work on one of the doors and we had trouble getting in contact with the host for +1 hr. Arrived around 8pm on Friday so maybe he was busy. We got lucky that someone heard us and opened the door. Previously, the host had been quick to respond. Another con is that the area is not the nicest--we brought everything in from the car when parking overnight. We did not feel unsafe at all, but it seemed like a bad idea to leave a car full of stuff on this street. The host was honest about this subject when I asked before booking"
