Stayed a few nights","I will rent this airbnb again if we have another volleyball tournament in Atlantic. The apartment is between Showboat and Ocean’s Resort. It is a 7 to 10 minute walk to the beach from Ocean’s side. The host is very clear with the instructions and the unit is exactly as described probably even better. The only downside is probably the parking slot if you have multiple cars since there is only one reserved spot for the unit so we ended parking one of the cars at Ocean’s but it has been communicated before hand by our hosts and they even gave us options. Overall, I highly recommend to those who is looking to stay in Atlantic City."

The properties are always clean, and spacious. And, we appreciate that the host are readily available by email or text for any questions.

Stayed a few nights","Went fir a basketball tournament on AC boardwalk. Loved location that was right across from OceaCasino and Boardwalk. As a walker, we parked car in the lot out front and then on last day moved our car to Ocean garage. The place was immaculate. Beds comfortable. The shower in second bathroom was very nice. Kitchen fully stocked with pots and pans and dishes. There is a Keurig so suggest bring your own k cups. Also plastic wrap if you need that. Furniture is very nice and 3 tvs.
Hist was very responsive. Outside steps and walkway could use remodel bur inside is lovely. A little road noise but we put on our own white noise and it blocked out outside sounds and a little loud talking from neighbors.
We loved the place and will defistay there again next time in AC."

Stayed a few nights","This was my second stay at this unit managed by Cozy Cohost. Mr. Paul, their representative maintains in touch with the guest. He also responds back immediately if and when I've had a question.
The unit is comfortable and well maintained. The photos are extremely descriptive of the unit.
I would and do recommend any units managed by Cozy Cohost to others seeking comfortability, a peaceful environment and that home-like feel.
Five Stars across the board."

Stayed a few nights","I had the pleasure of staying at the property for four nights. The premises were pristine, comfortable, private and extremely relaxing.
Mr Paul the representative for Cozy Co-host responded immediately to any questions I asked regarding ""how to lock the front door"" to an unexpected "" short term power outage"" .
The property reflects the photographs on the Airbnb website. The stay was extremely enjoyable. There was enough space for my guests and myself to relax in comfort without feeling as if we were on top of each other.
I most definitely would and already have recommended not only this property but other properties managed by Mr Paul and the Cozy Cohost organization to my friends.

Let's talk about the location – it couldn't have been better! So close to the boardwalk, beach, ocean casino, and showboat indoor waterpark. The place was clean and tidy and had everything we needed for a great stay. The host was super friendly. Paul responded very quickly to our message and solved the issue promptly during our stay.

Stayed a few nights","We loved the space. Right across from the Ocean hotel and the beach. We walked to the beach every day. I highly suggest to get up at 4:30 am and walk to the beach to view the sunrise! We really appreciated the washer and dryer, perfect to throw our towels in after the beach. Loved that the fridge has an ice maker (not all places do.) My daughter & fiancé loved the chess table, they got some games in before bed. The kitchen was spotless, appliances all new and working. We were provided enough towels, beds & furniture were clean, and the host was very responsive. The only minor issues were the sliding door to the balcony was difficult to open. And the parking space got a bit flooded in the rain, but I understand this is out of their control and not their fault. These are minor and I won’t take away any rating for it. These are definitely not something that would deter us from booking again, we loved the place. Definitely would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very clean and comfortable condo that is very well equipped with everything that you will need. Nice appliances, televisions and a refrigerator with an ice maker. Also, a nice full size washer and dryer that we didn't use. Convenient location in front of the Ocean Casino, so it's a short walk to the boardwalk. The only issues would be the sliding door to the deck is extremely difficult to open and the outside of the property could be much nicer. This is really a condo association issue, but it should be addressed. There was trash laying around in the yard when we arrived, but the next day, one of the homeowner's (I'm assuming) started to clean it up. I would recommend this rental."

I wish the pool had been opened but I completely understand that’s an HOAs issue. The weather was terrible when we were there so swimming wasn’t an issue. The unit is right behind the Ocean Casino and boardwalk and it’s a 5 min walk to the beach. It was a great location, great unit and exactly what our family needed. I highly recommend it! Thanks for providing a great place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","The house was beautiful while inside. Everything was as described, bathroom, kitchen, living room, balcony etc was very clean & organized. I contacted the host about an issue & they came right away & fixed it. I have no complaints about the house itself, BUT the neighborhood was a different story. We didn't feel safe as we heard neighbors moving around and walking and it felt as if they were in the house with us. It scared us especially at night. One of the nights it rained and the parking lot was flooded and we couldn't get to our car as there was water flooded around it so we had to stay in. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would book again as it was a beautiful house. I can't blame the host for the neighborhood. It is Atlantic City after all. Thank you for hosting us!!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay! The apartment was nicely decorated and the location was close to the beach and boardwalk. It was kept very neatly, there were very cute dishes in the kitchen! We did however, see a few ants on the counter when we came in. The dryer is also located near the kitchen smoke detector and it went off a few times as our laundry was running, so as a warning to other guests, don’t be alarmed by this. Also, one of the bathrooms has a tension rod and when we woke up it had fallen, it was easy to put up, but did eventually fall again (totally fixable, just be careful). Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this adorable apartment!"

Stayed a few nights","We typically stay at Oceans when we visit Atlantic City, but the room prices this particular weekend (really, most weekends) were very high. I checked out Airbnb instead and was so glad I did. This unit was steps away from Oceans, and with lots of newly renovated, clean, bright space (2 beds, 2 baths), we were very comfortable there. We had an assigned parking spot and could see our vehicle right out the window.
Admittedly, the outside of this condo complex isn't going to grace any magazine covers, but the ""Cozy Cohost"" couple is truly transforming the interiors of the units they've purchased.
Also, I tend to communicate a lot with my hosts, and they were such a pleasure to deal with - responsive, helpful, and committed to the area."

Stayed a few nights","I want to start off by saying that this was one of my all-time favorite AirBnb stays!
Decided to surprise my boyfriend with a quick staycation to Atlantic City and was looking for a cozy home for us to relax for a few days and this unit more than exceeded my expectations.
The layout of the place was absolutely gorgeous, even down to the intricate and cohesive details, the flow of the interior decor did not go unnoticed. The stringed balcony lights were also super cute.
Very comfortable beds with extra linens/pillows, plenty of washcloths/towels, you got an iron/ironing board, cups/glasses, full kitchen, washer/dryer etc. literally anything you have in your home, it's here! We didn't need or want for anything.
Best part was Paul and Ashley being SO helpful and kind before, during, and after our stay. They were so accomodating and truly made us feel like we were at home.
Don't think twice about booking this location, it's everything you're looking for and more. You won't regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved this place! The pictures provided are a true representation of the unit. The entire unit is very clean. The hosts have decorated it well. The furnishings are clean, new and well kept. The place has such a comfortable feel. The kitchen was spotless (not sure I have ever experience that at any other airbnb). The unit is within walking distance of so many restaurants and casinos. We were going to the Hard Rock for a concert. This unit was so convenient for that and way more affordable than staying at the Hard Rock. The exterior of the building could use some updating but other than that this place is near perfect. We would stay again! Also, the host responded quickly."

Stayed a few nights",Looking for a spot in Atlantic City can be scary! I loved this location! The building itself is being renovated in some areas however that did not affect us at all. The condo itself was lovely! Our hosts answered us immediately with any of our questions and concerns. The kitchen is just perfect and beautiful. New appliances and a washer and dryer! The living space is very calming and aesthetically pleasing. The bedrooms were also very comfortable and clean. Literally the only thing I would have wished for was a full length mirror in the bedroom. That is a minor issue that was more a preference. We stay in AC once a month for work and are always looking for places to stay. I really hope we get the opportunity to stay here again! :))) THANK YOU

Stayed about a week","We enjoyed our stay very much in this newly renovated unit, with super comfortable new furnishings, decor and beds. The host was quick to communicate and the location was superb - right across from Oceans and easy walking distance to the north end boardwalk, beach, Hard Rock, great restaurants, amusement ride pier etc. The 1960s building is undergoing a transition with many units being rehabbed. By we were never interrupted by construction or felt unsafe the whole week we were there. A new water park is slated to be built just across from the condominium complex, and the whole area will be that much more family friendly when it is. We would definitely stay here again and appreciated everything the host did to make our stay comfortable and special :-)"

Group trip","Had an amazing time with the airbnb. The first to have three floors and enough bathrooms.
Pros: enough bathrooms for everyone to shower if someone takes it. Has essentials for bathroom. Kitchen has seasonings and also many pots and pans and utensils as well as dishwasher soap, and dish soap and sponges. Trash bags enough to last us days
Cons. Some bathrooms do not lock. No curtains to cover sunlight. dishwasher doesn’t dry or completely washes dishes . Third floor locks do not work. Not enough blankets.
Would definitely come again! The hosts and cohosts were especially helpful and fast in replying and made us feel very welcome. Don’t miss out on this beautiful home!"

Very close to beach, boardwalk, Ocean’s Casino, and Showboat Waterpark & Arcade. Only complaint is there are no curtains or shades over balcony doors so at night if lights were on you could see in some of living room from the parking lot below- no big deal as the area was not busy.

Stayed with kids","The house was as described. Short walk to the beach/boardwalk. The hosts were responsive. We canceled our stay early due to ants all over the house when we woke up. The host made it right and refunded the rest of our stay. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a place local for 5 people on short notice so we had to cut our AC trip a little short. It did rain the night before and the hosts claim the ants are common in AC after it rains, but they were everywhere. They offered to send in an exterminator that day, but Ididn't want my kids in there afterwards. Other than the ants everything was as described and it had plenty of space for the 5 of us."

Very close to the Ocean, Showboat and Hard Rock Casino. A few minutes from the beach and Boardwalk. 10 Star rating!

Check-in was a breeze; the place is spotless with what seems like all brand new kitchen appliances. The beds and linens were extremely clean and they even had some extra amenities like body wash, hand soap, and makeup remover towels for our added comfort. The location was perfect, a block from the boardwalk as mentioned. We felt safe walking to and from the boardwalk, no matter the time of day. Overall, we all had nothing but positive memories and comments regarding this airbnb. Everything you need is accounted for and the hosts are very easy to reach out to. I would highly recommend this listing if you’re looking for a relaxing beach getaway in the Atlantic City area!"

Only issues we had, and a first at any of our Airbnb stays - no towels, we had to go out and purchase bath towels the next morning and no a lot of seating in the living room. Overall I would definitely recommend"

Separate entrance, as described, with easy to use keypad lock. End of block with parking and no traffic. Other than maybe a couple small freight trains per day on a line nearby, it was also quite tranquil out on the little porch.
Didn't require any help and owners left us alone to get some quality time in."

The bed is absolutely comfortable and they had everything you need from mouthwash toothpaste and toothbrush. The streaming roku cable was fine I sighed in and had my Hallmark channels witch I love especially around this time of the year they're playing 24/7 Hallmark Christmas movies. I loved it was 10 minutes from Smithville and A.C. I will definitely stay there again when I'm in town. Thanks Again Domingo.

The rental was located in a nice community at the end of a dead end street, so it was very quite and private. My husband and I love to visit the Jersey Shore every few years. We have so many memories over the years. There is something very special and nostalgic about it. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely place, well renovated and very close to the boardwalk.
Beautiful sunrise and sunset.
Small courtyard in the back convenient for dinner outside..
A restaurant for lunch/dinner right next door, excellent bagel (multiple flavor)
Only downside, if the 2nd bed is used in the living room and tenants from above arrive at a late hour, you are awake every time for sure, the door is right next door and zero soundproofing. Audible from the room also but less.
My experience, 2 nights without problem because alone but last night(Friday), the tenants of the 2nd came back at 3:15 am, 4:10 am and 5:25 am!!!"

Stayed a few nights","For the cost, the place was beautiful, the charm of a 100 year old row house, but appointed with a full modern kitchen, and modern bedroom and finishes. Plenty of dishes and glassware were provided, and we even made use of some games that were available since we weren't allowed to swim in the ocean. The area itself is not in the ""happening"" part of town, but that didn't bother us at all. The location is right next to a beautiful lighthouse, 2 blocks from the boardwalk, and just next to a delicious bagel place. We were out and about both day and night and we never felt unsafe.
I will say do your own research as far as dining goes; the hosts were kind enough to provide a book with recommendations, which we used the first night, but found it quite mediocre. There are many MANY options, especially if you are willing to drive a little.
All in all, I would stay here again!"

The unit was modern enough where it counts while still having a classic old beach house vibe. The location was great as well. The inlet neighborhood was very peaceful compared to other parts of Atlantic City, and its only a couple blocks from Ocean Casino and the boardwalk. Hot Bagels next door is a great classic breakfast spot and very convenient to have so close-by. The hosts were also quick to respond to any messages, although there werent any real problems to require much attention during our stay. I highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","My sisters and I met in Atlantic City in December 2023 to attend a concert and selected this Air BNB because it had two bedrooms and 3 beds and looked nice. However, when we arrived, we were extremely disappointed. First, we were not comfortable with the neighborhood and did not feel safe. The building is an old, large apartment complex with many units. The outside was covered in scaffolding and the inside was dark, outdated, and in need of maintenance. We had trouble accessing our unit at check-in and sent a message to the host, also asking where to park. The host did not respond and was not available to answer our questions. Inside there was an overpowering scent from numerous electric air fresheners (one sister has asthma), disappointing ""plastic covered"" mattresses, subpar appt. Despite having paid for two nights, we unanimously chose not to stay in the unit and paid for two hotel rooms instead. I asked for the cleaning fee back. She refused. We will not be back."

The rental served it’s purpose to have a place to relax.
Much better than staying in a cramped hotel room and is a change of scenery from the casino/ nightlife vibe when time to relax"

A little bit more instructions on what to do with the towels, trash, etc. But overall, great place. I would definitely recommend this place.

The house layout was just right for our family, but the second bedroom got very warm if you closed the door.
The kitchen is nice for occasional cooking, and the gift basket of snacks and wine was a nice bonus. A few more dishes, utensils, and kitchenware would be a nice add.
This was certainly a better option than staying in a cramped hotel room at a casino for a similar price."

Stayed a few nights","This AIR BNB WAS IMMACULATE & UNDOUBTLY ONE OF THE BEST AIRBNB'S IN ATLANTIC CITY THAT I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. The apartment is VERY CLEAN and well taken care of and totally worth the price. If you are contemplating what Airbnb to choose in Atlantic City, I say look no further BOOK NOW . First off I was not expecting such a clean, quiet modern space for the price asked. Secondly, I could not have asked for a better host. Check in was very easy and the host communicated and made sure I was comfortable. I HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb
I was in town for a concert and needed a place to stay rather than stay at overpriced hotels and this Airbnb exceeded my expectations. The apartment had 2 bedrooms, with 3 comfortable beds. The décor was modern , VERY CLEAN and COZY. The apartment had all the amenities that I could ask for, from freshly washed towels to bed linens to kitchen and bathroom essentials, you name it. The neighborhood is just like the quintessential Atlantic City neighborhood. The location was great as well, Its literally steps away from the Tropicana. We opted to use the parking at the Tropicana which was superrrrrrrrr convenient. If you’ve visited Atlantic City before you know how AWESOME having this is because HERES A MAJOR HACK, if you hold onto your receipt when leaving the casino you won’t be charged another parking fee AND you can use the same receipt at different casinos as well.
All in all, I totally recommend this to anyone needing a place to crash, whether that is tourist, someone briefly visiting the neighborhood for an occasion, students or families like mine. Absolute 5-star accommodations and reasonably priced for single travelers and groups! ShaSha has changed my perspective of staying at airbnb’s and have set the bar high. The customer service exceeded my expectation and deserves way more than this great review. Thanks!"

Above everything else the clean accommodations, location and great price was more than I could ask for The listing is also in a very nice area where it is also very easy to get to a variety of destinations as stores and entertainment are really close by. I come to Atlantic City frequently so I am happy to have found this Airbnb. The Tropicana hotel is super close . I had no problems with street parking, however when casino hopping I used the Tropicana parking facility and the ticket I received from them, which was great because parking was one less thing we had to worry about. We would definitely recommend this place and quite honestly book here again. The host was patient, friendly and very much accommodating. Also a great communicator with a fairly quick response time, big plus!"

Stayed a few nights","The fact it was no parking, roaches, noisey windows screens not the right size for windows disturbing the sleeping all night!, smelled like smoke in the Whole building!
Stop trying to scam people too!
You lied and said items were taken out of you apartment which is false!
I provided ALL my things for myself! I used 2 bandaid and peroxide you lied and they were stolen! I had my own spray you lied and said it was stolen! I had literally brought my own kitchen items! And left things behind to help you with you mediocre kitchen supplies and you lied and said I still a wine cup I literally had paper cups, plates, utensils, paper towels, pots pans and a air fryer! Never used or removed any of your stay and if I did it’s still there! Stop trying to lie! And the fact it smelled like Cigarettes in the whole building in a little bit in the and apartment, and you have roaches humble yourself!"

Stayed a few nights","One block from the boardwalk!Centrally located in the action. One block from the boardwalk! Right across the street from the Tropicana casino. Easy access to restaurants. Clean, comfortable and accommodating. The host was quick to respond to any questions. We received a lovely gift basket upon our arrival.
There are some things to keep in mind. Although the unit is newly remodeled the building is older. There is public parking, free and paid, on the street, but can be hit or miss availability. There is always parking in the Tropicana parking garage which is right across the street."

Stayed a few nights","I dont know where to start.. the views was amazing, the stay was clean, the place was secured, and right on the boardwalk! Atlantic palace was close to the ferris wheel, resorts & the hard rock casino. I would 100% stay again, the minute you walk in you’re stunned by the view. Although there’s two beds, I don’t think more than max 3 people should be staying here! 10/10
Recommend, id come back again!"

Stayed a few nights","At first I had some hesitation about staying outside of a hotel in AC because of AC’s reputation.
But I have to say this experience was great. The room is cleaner than many of the casino hotels I have stayed in. There is security at the front desk, the doors are locked after a certain hour so i was able to feel totally safe in this city.
My big thing was the bellhop service was amazing! Something that I use to have to walk with my luggage from the parking lot through the casino floors. Here they took our stuff to the room and out of the room and it was such a smooth process.
Also all the staff in the front were super friendly and always willing to help.
Will be staying here again on our next visit."

Stayed with kids","The condo was on the 17th floor. Beautiful view of the boardwalk and the ocean!
Picking up the key and the parking pass was easy & the instructions were clear. The condo was super clean, the beds were both absolutely very comfortable! The kitchen had everything you could need and the bathroom had a lovely jacuzzi tub.
We only wish we could have stayed longer!
My only complaint was that the AC unit was loud, just like it said in the listing. I woke up in the night to it rattling - and I discovered that the rattling was actually just the door to the controls. I stuck a tissue in door to prevent it from rattling and went back to sleep. It’s easily remedied if you get stuck hearing the rattle.
The stay was lovely, location can’t be beat. You can walk to the beach within steps.
We were pleased that the condo was quiet all night - no sounds of partying to disturb us! Overall great stay!"

Stayed a few nights",We were in town for the Tidalwave Festival. Location is as perfect as we didn’t have to travel the streets of Atlantic City because the resort had a boardwalk entrance. We were very close to our event and it made the trip even nicer. Wagner was always quick to respond if I had questions and was helpful in making us feel comfortable. Bed was hard so I was a little skeptical at first because I have a bad back but the bed ended up being perfect that I didn’t wake up with pain in the morning. Plenty of blankets for both beds. Kitchenette was perfect for our stay. I suggest taking advantage of the bell hop to take your stuff from the street to the condo and then calling at the end of the trip to take your stuff back down to the roundabout. Bell hop made check out so easy by holding the elevator when he came to pick our stuff up that we bypassed all the full elevators of people trying to get down to check out. Well worth the tip!

The only word of advice I can give to future guests is to write down your streaming service information to log in once you get there because you must provide your own..but hopefully you're not inside so much that you need to watch tv!

The host provided very thorough and clear instructions and directions on everything, on multiple occasions, which was just extremely helpful and showed how much care they put into the experience.
While we were at the beach, the host let us know the cleaners finished our place a bit early and we were cleared to check in, which was great. I know it’s rare and unpredictable for peak season early check ins, but this showed the host was really on top of things!!
The gym was simple and small but clean and had just what I needed. The pool and pool area were fabulous.
The building and parking staff were very friendly and helpful, too."

Host was always super responsive and friendly. Thanks for sharing via multiple channels (AirBnB messaging, emails, …) - very personable and caring.
Advices for other guests- use InstaCart for groceries (eg water bottles, fresh fruits, instant noodles, snacks, …) - CVS and ShopRite as sources (there isn’t AmazonFresh deliveries there), and UberEats to get food deliveries around the clock.
Parking- above level 3 in the deck, it was easy to get great parking spaces.
Thanks again, host! Loved our stay there."

Stayed one night","Unsuccessful getting into the room. The card swipe did not work after several swipes. Went downstairs to security a few times for help. They advised they really aren’t supposed to help being that we aren’t hotel guest and are with Air BNB. He eventually said he’ll reprogram our key himself. As we weren’t sure what to do and the host hadn’t responded back yet and we needed to be somewhere. After security reprogrammed our key we went back up still no success. The host responded back at this time and advised it is sometimes hard to unlock the door “try to swipe the card and push the door hard and sometimes it takes a few swipes”. We tried no luck. At this point becoming very frustrated. We went back to security and he too now frustrated along with us came to room and had to fix.
The tub had a disgusting brown residue on the bottom. Was not able to wash in room.
Heat didn’t work, slept in hoodie while it was 30 degrees outside.

The building itself had a ton of fun things to do on the 3rd floor including an indoor outdoor pool, game room & spa! Wonderful experience & if you stay here buy some bubble bath & run the jets, you won't be disappointed! Only critique is give the room about 2 or 3 hours to cool down as it was a little hot when we first got there but it cooled down eventually."

Stayed a few nights","Great stay for a great value! Quiet building when compared to staying at a hotel like Tropicana which the party lives on all night. Great diner on the first floor and the palace is right on the boardwalk. The location is about 10-15 minute walk from hard rock casino and about 25 minute walk to Tropicana with a lot to do in-between. They have a spa if you like , room included a jet tub and views were spectacular. I recommend you take the hour tour through the ripleys believe it or not museum right next door, we went as a young couple but would be great for kids. The room was better than hotel rooms like the Tropicana which we had family staying at, there is simply just more to do at the quarter within the Tropicana which has 40+ stores to shop. Definitely will be back in the summer months to enjoy the ocean!"

Stayed a few nights","The view was beautiful, the bed was so comfortable and we felt safe at that location. The room was very clean (although it did smell like cigarette smoke) but still giving a 5 star rating because it was a great place to stay.
It was nice to walk right out to the boardwalk. The Hard Rock is close which was really convenient for us. We used the fitness room and got a great workout in. The parking garage was also a plus.
Our first morning we needed a toaster, salt & pepper and oil (which were on the list of amenities) to make brunch but they weren’t there. I contacted AC and he contacted his team. A lady brought the items up a short while later but by that time we were done eating.
Some helpful tips: There’s a jacuzzi tub which was definitely a plus. If you plan to use it to relax, pack bubble bath and a blow up neck pillow. The view from the bathroom is awesome.
If you’re a coffee drinker bring coffee and filters. They had instant coffee and a coffee maker but no coffee to brew.
Our key card stopped working and the gentleman I talked to was very friendly and helpful getting us a second key. We don’t know why it stopped working because we kept the key away from credit cards and cell phones. Triple check your placement of your room key."

Stayed a few nights","Great stay at Anne’s place! Place was just as described. Clean, updated and SECURE. Also, walkway leading to property was well lit. Something I appreciate. Everything needed for a weekend getaway was supplied. Bed and pillows weren’t the most comfortable , but after staying in many hotels and now AirBnB’s, what beds are? Lol. Wanna great nights sleep, bring your own pillows. 1/2 block walk south to Kelsey’s and 1 1/2 block walk south to Boardwalk and casinos. Plenty of restaurants in the area.
However, if you go just north, atmosphere begins to change a bit. There are a few local undesirables roaming the streets late at night. Being from Philly, it was not an issue but may be an eye opener for others. Just a heads up.
All in all, great place to stay and when in AC again, I keep an eye out for Anne’s place!"

There were a few stains on linens and bathroom floor mat had been left on the toilet seat when we first arrived, but not a big deal. Parking is a bit difficult to find, but overall the Airbnb was nice and convenient, right in the middle of town."

Stayed one night","The apartment is small, but we expected a studio and it was well priced when all of the hotels were tons more. The location is very close to the beach, but sadly, Atlantic City is a little bit rundown, and this location is a part of that. Once you get inside of the apartment, everything is renovated and clean and new, with amenities we needed for our quick trip. Unfortunately, I did not feel safe walking where our place was at night alone. Owner was lovely, allowed us to check in early, and parking was not difficult. Will probably not stay there again, but more because of the neighborhood than anything wrong with the actual room/owner."

Stayed one night","Yes, appears bigger than the photos but room was extremely clean. We went to a show at Broadwalk Hall and it was literally next door. Beach and Broadwalk was steps away. No issues with neighborhood, if you've been to AC everything near Airbnb you see is what you see on the Broadwalk. I have no complaints and would stay again. It was affordable and private. I never felt unsafe and parked in the lot near the side of the house for $10 overnight and at 10am before check out a spot opened in front of the house and I parked without parking pass. The room had snacks which was another bonus."

We got there late and had to park in the tropicana garage overnight. During the day, if you get there early enough there's plenty of parking opportunities on the street during the week. Overall, an amazing stay."

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I had a wonderful stay here. Upon arrival we had the easiest check in and even managed street parking the first try. The apartment was perfect for us two and was incredibly clean and comfortable. There were plenty of amenities and snacks provided for us by the owner. The location is perfect and just a minute walk from the beach. We spent a great amount of time on the boardwalk as it was almost next door to us. Parking on Bellevue Ave was less difficult than we anticipated but the forewarning from the owner helped us be prepared. Towards the night time parking becomes full and you’ll likely have to pay for 12 hour parking at the lot next door, but it wasn’t hard to park in the morning when other residents leave for the day. We felt safe being next to the boardwalk, and at night we spotted some of the cats that wander the beach and boardwalk when it’s quiet, which was a treat. We had a great stay here and would return for our next trip!"

She also left snacks and drinks along with bathroom products which were very nice to have with us on our stay and she provided great communication with the check in information and included a free parking pass for our trip:)"

Stayed one night","All the reviews are right! Barbara’s place is exactly as pictured. The most clean airbnb I’ve ever been to. I felt so much more comfortable here than at a hotel. She had a few little snacks, bottles of water, extra blanket in drawer, an iron, blow dryer, soap, salt/pepper, tin foil, microwave, and so many little convenient things. We only were here over night to sleep, however it is the perfect spot for two people for any kind of AC trip. Steps from the boardwalk where the beach is, so perfect in the summer. Air conditioner worked nicely. Bed was so comfortable and so clean! Parking is the only issue but as long as you plan ahead, you can make it work. Would absolutely stay again!"

Stayed one night","This airbnb is aligned with the description. The bed is comfy and it's a minute to the boardwalk. As everyone else says no parking more than 3 hours so we parked at the Tropicana at a 5 minute walk (20$/24 hrs). Barbara is a fast communicator and very accommodating so we were very grateful for her kindness and support.
The negative to our stay was that we did bring ear plugs and in spite of that the downstairs neighbor had a couple's fight from 1-3 AM that made the walls shake and felt like we were in the crosshairs of their quarrel. Just noting this for transparency, we probably could've called in a noise violation, but really just wanted to go back to sleep."

Stayed a few nights","My fiancé and I enjoyed our stay here during BRT weekend and the neighbors on the left are extremely nice. The main issue we ran into during our stay was the parking because the parking on the street was only for 3 hours not over night. DO NOT go to the parking lot that is on the airbnb street nearest the beach on the right, they will price gouge you and are not friendly. The best parking we could find was at Tropicana (it is a couple blocks away but a nice walk) for a flat rate of $15 for multiple nights(you dont recieve a ticket when you go into the self park garage but you have to pay everytime you leave the garage).Once we parked our car there, we did not move until we check out of the airbnb a couple of nights later."

We had a blast in AC casino hopping and walking the boardwalk. Barbara was a very communicative host and even let us check in a little early, much appreciated. We parked at Tropicana self parking for $10 for the two nights and it was easy peasy! Thank you for a great stay!"

It's within an 8 minute drive to where the race starts, and the finish line was just a few blocks away on the boardwalk. Great for me as the spectator to stop in to certain points to watch and then head back to the apt for a restroom break or to escape the heat. The studio space was exactly what we needed. For parking, we ended up parking our vehicle at the Tropicana outdoor parking lot. The one right before the hotel. It was $20 for 24hr period. Will be back again for sure! Thank you Barbara for hosting us!"

The room gets nice and cool at night with the fan and ac that she has in the room which is perfect.
She also had complementary snacks upon arrival.
I only chose three stars for the value due to the location. although it is a one minute walk from the beach , the actual street itself is a bit sketchy, dirty and homeless do walk around at night other than that. This was a great stay."

parking lot 50 ft away were we were able to park the whole weekend for 20.00 a day . We never moved our car it was so convenient. The apartment was spotless and we didn't eat there but you could cook a meal if you wanted to . The bed was so comfortable we slept like logs . I would definitely come and stay her again . We had the great privilege of meeting both Barbara and her family and they were super nice . Thank you for your hospitality. This is a wonderful place . You won't be disappointed"

The only thing more amazing than this perfect little apartment, was Barbara’s communication throughout it all. She provided so much information throughout the process, that I didn’t need to ask any questions. But when one did come up, she responded almost immediately. Her apt was incredibly clean and cozy, and the bed was super comfy. It had perfect modern touches to the decor and great amenities as well. It was absolutely perfect for a little overnight stay for my girlfriend and I- while hotels and other air bnb’s were charging anywhere from 2 to 3 times the amount of Barbara’s place. I couldn’t speak more highly of this experience."

Stayed a few nights","Barbara’s place is great. It’s well designed and decorated with all the necessary amenities. We cooked tacos one night, and the conduction plate heated up just as fast as a typical stove. There is a cute little cast iron skillet which made cooking even more fun and yummy. The only bummer (which is outside the control of the property and Barbara) is that the beach has a large eye sore — an awkward semi-abandoned pier. The boardwalk was also a little dirty with very few people wearing masks. Especially during these times, I would recommend sticking away from the boardwalk and staying at the beach. The beach was not crowded and had plenty of space for social distancing. Overall, our experience was great, and we would return. Thanks again, Barbara!"

Stayed one night","All in all, I’d give it a 7.5/10. I assumed the studio was a bit bigger because of the pictures provided, however it served its purpose effectively.
I was not thrilled with the neighborhood as at night tons of homeless people congregate on the same block as the studio. However, they did not interfere with my trip at all, just stating it because if you’re a female or solo traveler you should know that.
Half a block from the boardwalk, so very convenient location in that regard.
Parking is stressful so plan ahead to park at the lot or use the parking pass provided but not moving your vehicle for the duration of the trip.
I probably won’t stay there again if it’s for more than a few days (weekend type thing) but for short stays I’d recommend it."

We felt safe walking to the ocean but on our return back to room we took a taxi. The place was even better than what we were expecting. would definitely stay again.

Stayed a few nights","Great value for the location. One block away from the boardwalk and all of the fun things on the shore.
Car park could be a little more organized as it is only valet parking. Suggestion: Since you have to pick up your car from the back, there should be an attendant back there instead of having to walk to the front and then walk to the back. Small inconvenience.
Everything else was great though. Go to Perry's dinner on the next corner for breakfast! Absolutely delish!"

The front desk staff is very friendly and attentive. Our stay was quiet pleasant and comfortable. The walk to the boardwalk and casinos is incredibly easy! This is the way to go when visiting Atlantic City. More affordable and comfortable than the casinos. Would stay here again!"

Stayed one night","This was my first time booking a hotel, + a name-brand hotel at that, via airbnb. It's actually the Courtyard by Marriott and you are a regular guest like any other. It was by far the most affordable on the whole strip and the area. Only 3 quiet blocks from the boardwalk and Resorts and some cool new restos and bars a bit off the strip. They even let me check in at 3pm, not 4pm. Very nice hotel. Great lobby. 24-hr gym but it's kind of small and hot so I didnt use it. No resort fee or pool. Front desk is very nice. Would like free breakfast but no one does that in AC. Area is generally safe, but some shady characters around, and that's just AC. (Someone pooped a block away so I noticed the aftermath of that on my way to the beach.) If you stay on the boardwalk, you really pay for it -- and lots of resort fees and no early check-in, late check out. Which I took advantage of. Also the even numbers-side faces the small streets and Bally's, Trop. Odd side faces Hard Rock, Ocean."

Stayed one night","It’s okay. The hotel is definitely a little rough around the edges. They didn’t include any basic amenities, like shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower. We only had one small bar soap to wash hands with. Also, the iron did not work at all, and the ironing table was stuck open. The beds and pillows were fine, average for a hotel. The front desk was not willing to break a larger bill for me, and didn’t give any advice on where I could (their restaurant, local gas station, etc). Check-In also took some time, as there were “two” people checking people in (completely fine) except one of them was just standing on their phone, not wanting to check anyone in until the other coworker finally asked them to help with the line. Overall the hotel was relatively clean, just rough on the edges with limited amenities and mediocre customer service. If I had to do this process over, I probably would look elsewhere to book a room."

Stayed one night","Had a great stay. We went to see a show at the Hard Rock casino and this location was only a 5 minute walk away and a MUCH more affordable alternative, since the show sent room prices sky high. Super convenient! And it was right between the show venue and our restaurant right down the strip. Parking was a breeze and I'm grateful bc parking was definitely an issue everywhere else on the strip. The room was clean, comfortable and generally as described. The best part of this experience was the customer service. My questions through the airbnb app were answered extremely promptly and completely (Jason) and in-person, I found April to be welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Overall a great experience. Happy to give my thumbs up."

Stayed a few nights","This hotel is located in a city. So for people that are looking for a quiet suburban feel ; this is not the place for you. However, it was the place for me. It's literally 1 block from the boardwalk/ beach. The hotel room matched the pics from Airbnb. My 2 issues were :the room was right next door to the fire exit and you couldn't control the thermostat temperature. It wouldn't let me set it past 74 degrees . Yet, the room temperature always stated it was 74°. I was cold at nite. The hot water was ok but not as hot as at the Hyatt.
There is a $50 a day hold on your card even if you book thru Airbnb, but they will take it off. there will be a hold on the parking fee but they will take that off as well. parking is currently $20 a day and the lot is behind the hotel down a narrow alley . the staff was 👍🏿!!!
All in all this is probably one of the best deal you're going to find that close to the beach that's decent. so I would stay again and book thru Airbnb again to get the best rate."

Very shady…. Also they have a female security guard that’s very rude and makes you uncomfortable. She kept trying to figure out which room I was in and if I was really a quest and that made me feel uncomfortable because why do you not think I’m a guest?…. Their bistro is a joke. Very unprofessional and terrible food and coffee. Very very unprofessional….

The area on the boardwalk was beautiful and the room was clean. We had a great view of the city and the beach and got local recommendations from the front desk.

I felt safe and at peace even when it was past midnight. Sam was very nice and welcoming! There is very limited parking in the area, however, if you have the parking pass, you should be able to find a spot around the block, if not on the street. I honestly would like to stay here again if I come back to Atlantic City! It definitely was a great first experience!"

Stayed one night","My husband and I went into AC for a wedding and decided to stay at an Air bnb since the check in was at 2 pm, vs 4pm. Sam has great communication. He let us know before hand we could possibly check in early (which we were able to) and let us know what to expect etc. He left detailed instructions about everything .
The apartment was very clean. We only stayed one night, but would have been a comfortable stay for long periods of time since there is a washer/dryer and a small kitchen.
The apartment was close to a the tanger outlets and about 10 minutes from Bally’s and Caesars, and the boardwalk. Very convenient…
Sam is also a very passionate plant person, which is awesome in my book!
The only con was the parking. If you come home late expect to park and possibly walk a block. It’s a quiet street, and was unsure about walking at night but it seemed safe. Just make sure you read street signs, use your parking pass and your car will be ok. The other option is park, check in and then Uber to your destination (parking at the casinos are $10-$25 anyways)."

Stayed one night","My husband and I along with another couple were in town spending one night to go see a comedy show. After looking at what felt like every hotel in Atlantic City, and realizing that we weren't going to find something within our budget for the night, I decided to give Airbnb a try. This was my first time booking a room with an Airbnb. I found Sam and Serj's apartment listed and it looked like the perfect fit for our short stay. So after booking through the app, Sam reached out to me and was so welcoming and this put my skeptical mind at ease. This whole experience was terrific!!! From start to finish. The apartment was beautiful. Great location to the beach, casinos, outlets, etc. Sam and Serj made the check-in and check-out effortless. And also provided a list of restaurants and things to do during our stay. All 4 of us were so impressed and loved everything about this experience including the ease and hospitality. I one thousand percent recommend booking with them. My husband and I were talking about booking Sam and Serj's apartment again and staying longer next time we come to AC. Thanks again for a wonderful experience!!!"

Nice area in the back to sit with all his beautiful plants. Directions and recommendations were clearly marked. Samuel let us have our privacy, and didn't bother us once."

The beds were comfortable - she left to use the other one when I snored too loud - and the amenities were appreciated, even if we didn’t get to use them (like the beach chairs). It was a quick walk to the Boardwalk and restaurants like the Salvadoran restaurant we checked out. The wildlife habitat was an interesting surprise and much more than a place for my dog to relieve himself. Not all properties we’ve looked at had cable TV so that amenity was especially appreciated.
We wished we had more time to spend and will consider staying at the home when planning future trips to Atlantic City."

Stayed with a pet","Can’t knock the hospitality from Samuel or from the fact you’re walking distance to the beach, but I found the location itself to be a little underwhelming. Samuel kept a very clean unit, but the street itself had two couches on the sidewalk that looked like they were actively being used, a smashed flat screen TV on the sidewalk, a significant amount of broken glass that we had to carry our dog over, and overall just a lot of trash/debris in the street/sidewalks. I don’t say this to be nit-picky, but I think it’s an important expectation for other guests to have prior to arrival. We arrived earlier in the afternoon and were able to find a parking spot right in front, and it was convenient to have a parking pass provided by the host.
Aside from that, we thought that everything in the unit was nice and being able to do laundry and use the provided beach chairs was a perk."

The apartment is located on the ground floor, within walking distance of the Boardwalk, but still at some distance from the ""center"" of the Boardwalk. Nice that all amenities are available. Very clean apartment. Fortunately, there is AC available because without it can be quite hot. The AC does make some noise, which along with the street noise can be annoying for some. Parking in front of the door with Sam's parking pass is ideal!"

Samuel was within a text reach and answered any questions we had.
We cant wait to rent again real soon.
Tropucana is a 5 block walk and it's safe to walk late at night. I did it at 230 in the morning.
Entrance way is lit by sensor lights as you approach the apt at night."

He was there to greet us upon arrival and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. He's a wonderful communicator and responded to any inquiries almost instantly! The apt is super comfy and the memory foam mattress was the perfect ending to each day. If this place is available when are searching for somewhere to stay, look no futher than Samuel's place and I promise you wont regret it."

visiting my aunt and decorating the place for my girlfriend and friends since it was her bday! not only did he say i will let you know but he let me check in a few hours early at 11! Sam checked on me and gave so many suggestions as to where to eat at etc and btw the two ice cold mugs in the freezer were an amazing touch! Sam and I’m not just saying this is probably the most lenient chill Airbnb owner i’ve come across! his place is where i’ll be going the next time i come to AC! not to mention it’s two blocks from the boards too!"

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at Samuel's place so much! The attention to detail in the apt was commendable, every time we needed something, it was there & it was so neat, tidy and clean, plenty of outlets & nightlights in all the rooms & 2 locks on the doors, locks & blinds on all the windows, it felt very safe. We enjoyed complete privacy while also receiving regular messages from our host, just checking on us and making sure we had what we needed, kindly and unobtrusively. When we first arrived he messaged us that he had arranged overnight parking in a neighbors driveway for us in case we couldn't find street parking close enough! We had no trouble parking on the street close by within the range of the permit he provided. On our last night in AC it rained heavily, Sam messaged us with movie theater suggestions and how to instruct food delivery if we stayed in. It was just a really nice experience! The only thing to know is that the ceilings are low, the beds are full size, spring mattresses & this is not a party pad, the hosts do live above and request that noise is kept to a minimum, (which was fine by us). I had only ever stayed at casino hotels in AC before this and I'm so glad we were unable to book a hotel room and ended up at Sam's place!"

He is a thorough communicator and extremely accommodating. He keeps his place extremely clean and takes pride in its cleanliness. Samuel goes above and beyond to make sure he is meeting his guests expectations. He communicates with you throughout the weekend giving you suggestions for places to eat and things to do in town. He is readily available at almost all times of the day to answer any questions or accommodate any requests you might have. The place was advertised accurately and we can not express in words accurately enough how clean his place is. Sams place is located in a great location just 2.5 blocks from the beach and isn’t far from the center of town. I was extremely happy with my stay and would recommend Sams place to anyone looking to stay in Atlantic City for a weekend. I will definitely be re-visiting in the near future."
