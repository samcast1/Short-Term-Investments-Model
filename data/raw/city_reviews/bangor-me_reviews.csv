Group trip",We had a great time. Only spent one night but it was worth it. Very peaceful and quiet on a dead end road. We didn’t use the fire pit but it was there for use. The hot tub was a great touch after a long day. All in all it was a great stay. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend.

Stayed one night","Coleen was an exceptional host. Due to a freak spring snow storm, we requested a schedule change very last minute. Coleen was so flexible and accommodating. The home is charming and the hot tub was a nice perk. The house does have some quirks and we felt the stay was a little overpriced for the quality of the home. Beside price, this a fun stay."

Everything was as described and we found we had everything we needed. Plenty of space to relax and enjoy each other’s company. The decor and theme throughout the house made you feel at home instead of at a sterile rental. Colleen has clearly taken the time and effort to create a tranquil, eclectic, and beautiful place to stay. With the Waterfront Concert venue within walking distance and the Cross Insurance Center even closer this would be the perfect spot to stay and take in a show!"

It's good to know: from quite early in the morning you can hear the planes taking off and landing from a nearby airport. No problem for us, no problem because we had to leave early. But maybe something to take into account."

Group trip","Cute place with lots of character and fun decor! Conveniently short walk to the concert venue and other local attractions. Only thing I can think of that could be an issue is the stairs, if anyone in your group has a hard time going up and down a lot of stairs it may not be the best option but otherwise it was perfect! Coleen was really quick to respond to all messages and covered everything we could need in the listing."

Stayed one night","Good location, close to downtown in a quiet neighborhood. It was near the cross insurance arena of which we were seeing a show. Close to TIMBER (amazing restaurant). Cool funky furniture in the living room and terrace off of the family room made for nice hang out spot. Quite clean and tidy. However when we entered the house there was a very obvious cigarette smoke smell downstairs.The hot tub water was brownish and smelled musty. Didn't seem like it had been cleaned or maintained water quality. The beds were fine and big towels were nice! This house could have used another bathroom as the bedrooms were on the 3rd and 1st floor. The overall smell of the house really threw us, but was a totally fine home base for one night. Coleen was very friendly/responsive and made check in/check out easy."

Group trip","Thank you Coleen for a wonderful experience. Six adults (including two grandmothers both over 80!!) enjoyed his three-floor home that was both intimate and spacious.
The kitchen was well-provisioned, including delicious organic coffee that Coleen had left for us to enjoy. Since we ate two breakfasts and two dinners at the house, we were able to take full advantage of the house. All bedrooms were very comfortable and we all slept very well. The bathroom had great amenities and many huge cotton towels.
We enjoyed the TV and large dining table to play games at night. The hot tub was a treat for some in our party. The second-floor porch was a welcome retreat to ease into the morning.
Coleen checked in with us multiple times. Her directions for check-out were clear and concise.
We are so grateful for our fabulous weekend to celebrate my son's college graduation from Orono. If we ever have the occasion to stay in Bangor again, we would happily return to stay at Coleen's bungalow."

Stayed with kids",We loved the house! It was nice and big with plenty of room for my children to run and play or separate and have quiet time. I was bummed that there was not tv in the bedroom but that’s just me. There are two steep sets of wooden stairs (only one if your stay in the basement room) that my 3 year old made me nervous on and after 10 days started warring on my body so anyone with bad hips or knees be warned there’s no way around it you have to climb the steps. Coleen was super responsive and kind. We got lobsters and she brought pots to accommodate our cooking very fast. The grill fire pit and hot tub were an awesome added bonus for my family gave us time something to wind down and do at night. The hot tub was a little funky by the time we left and there were no instructions on cleaning or maintaining while we were there but that’s partly on me for not reaching out. All in all it was an amazing place to stay and we would happily stay again on our next visit! Great place and a great value!

My one warning is that there is only one bathroom so if you come with a lot of people, just beware of that."

Group trip","The house was great and looked just like the listing photos. Lots of knick knacks and home decor. Stayed here for a relaxing girls trip. We cooked lots of meals and found everything we needed in their kitchen. They also had a small coffee, tea& hot chocolate bar. Very close to main area of Bangor which is convenient. Hot tub was a plus! Bedrooms are located on bottom and top floors while the bathroom is located on the main floor. The only complaint we really have is that the main floor has no curtains or shades in any of the windows, aside from the sliding doors to the deck. You can see into the main floor from the backyard all the way through to the front at night which made us feel a little uneasy at times being all girls during our stay. We are not from Maine so I’m not sure if it’s common to have open windows like this in these areas. Other than that, great stay and no complaints. Coleen was very responsive and answered all questions we had before, during and after our stay!"

It is a great addition and my friends and I enjoyed using it after a day of hiking in ANP. The location of the house is also perfect. It's a walking distance to the waterfront and the restaurants/brewery."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time we have rented one of Coleen's homes, and again we were not disappointed. We come to Maine to run a half marathon in Millinocket, and we really enjoy staying in Bangor for our girls weekend away.
This house was exactly as advertised. The kitchen had everything that we needed.
The beds were comfortable, the whole house was immaculate and adorably decorated. The Hot tub was our favorite feature of the house.
We love that both times we have stayed with Colleen, she has gone to the effort to decorate for Christmas. That is a wonderful touch.
One thing to be aware of would be the stairs. You enter the house on the basement level and there is a steep set of stairs to climb to get to the first floor. This might be an issue for anyone with any mobility issues. There is a great handrail there for safety.
Coleen responded immediately to any questions that we had. We will definitely stay with her again."

Great value and extremely close to the casino/arena/race track area in Bangor. Would be an excellent place to stay when attending anything at those venues as it’s easily walkable. The layout is a little awkward since it’s an older house. There was a Bedroom in the basement and two upstairs, which felt more like an attic with the very low ceilings, and the only bathroom was on the main floor."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely loved our stay at this adorable bungalow, with its old New England charm tucked into a sloping hillside. It had everything we were looking for: hot tub, fireplace, peace and quiet. My favorite part of the house itself was the living room/dining area, very aesthetic/zen set up with a smart TV for entertainment, and a big beautiful dining table (having a kitchen and washer/dryer was also beneficial). Only an hour from Acadia National Park (which was 10/10), and even closer to other locally recommended hikes within 30 mins to get amazing overlook views of the mountainous landscape (do Bald Mountain in Dedham, or Chick Hill in Clifton, or both), or the Bangor City Forest for a less vertical nature walk. We loved coming home to Coleen’s every day to decompress after exploring the town (Mount Hope Cemetery, Stephen King’s house, Eagle’s Nest for lobster, Nocturnem Draft Haus, Wicked Brew café, Hollywood Casino, all worth visiting.) I am appreciative to Coleen for being a great host and allowing us the opportunity to create all these special memories. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a good “home base” in Maine!"

Stayed a few nights","A small, lovely place with a nice fire pit in the backyard. Quiet neighborhood close from the highway. Kind of far from Acadia if that's where you're headed to. Might not be ideal if you like to sleep in on your vacation, or don't like cold and wet weather.
About the house:
Maine is extremely humid in summer (we went in early October and it was still super humid). That cold and humidity is only magnified by the fact that this house is in (yes, in) a hill. The first floor is semi underground and was cold and wet. When I first arrived and sat on the mattress, it felt as if it was full of water (not literally full, but it had a lot of water in it for sure). But this is not a problem on the second and third floor which are above ground level. If you have fewer than 4 guests, you won't need to sleep on the first floor.
The second floor is the main living room, dining room, kitchen and balcony, which are all super lovely, well functional, and what we enjoyed the most during our stay.
The third floor has 2 more bedrooms which are dry and comfy. Room is a bit limited with the A-shape roof.
There is a fire pit, gas BBQ grill and nice hot tub in the yard. You need to buy your own fire starter and log. We got it from a nearby supermarket and enjoyed a nice fireside chat.
About the experience:
Everything was great until checkout. We enjoyed the fireside chat so much that the next morning we didn't wake up until 10AM. Checkout was at 11AM. The cleaning lady arrived when we were just finishing brunch. She said she could start in the bedrooms while we cleaned things up in the kitchen, so that's what we did. But our host was not happy that we checked out 1 hour late, and there was some strong wording in the message I received.
From the hosts' standpoint, I understand that since there is only one property, if they need to get it ready for another guest to check in by 3PM on the same day, then they need to start at 11AM or sometimes even 10AM sharp. I would agree with our host that it was, quoting the message, ""truly an inconvenience to our staff and the next guest"".
Meanwhile from a guest's standpoint, especially someone who would like to have the flexibility to sleep in a little bit on vacation, I find that hotels generally offer much better flexibility with regard to late checkout unless they're literally fully booked.
I definitely could have done a better job communicating to the host that we needed late checkout, or I could have risen a bit earlier to avoid creating the inconvenience; but still, I fail to see how it's a critical problem when the cleaning lady was able to start her job at 11AM as expected.
Overall the checkout experience felt like an exam: you should be out promptly, you should adhere to all of the instructions, or you're a failed guest. The message I received was that I checked out 1 hr late, I forgot to register the 2 additional guests who ended up joining me in my trip (drove 10 hrs straight, too tired and forgot to add them), and after I drove away I realized my friend forgot to start the dishwasher after loading it. So in summary, I'm probably a terribly failed guest?
I felt aweful about it. It definitely wasn't my intention to bring others inconvenience, but oh well, sometimes we slip. I offered our host to pay late checkout fee as well as additional cleaning fee. I hope it could at least partially compensate for my imperfect performance as a guest, but next time I take a vacation, I definitely won't be looking to give myself such a rigorous ""perfect guest test"". I'm not a perfect guest, or a perfect persion by any measure, and I'd appreciate some room to be on the chill side on my vacation; it does not work very well in situations with low tolerance for error like this one."

The bedrooms have no closets, only one small bathroom with Scott toilet paper and stairs up and down any direction. You will have to empty the humidifier 2 or 3 times a day. The ability to do laundry was nice. We never felt totally comfortable in living room or hang out together as only a 2 small uncomfortable couches. Loved the decoration of house but will do better research next time. Only one tv in the house. We never used hot tub as no awning to be outside when raining and lights not working on one side so we felt creeped out. Place needs to be painted, doors stick and doors in kitchen open into vents. Overall felt like a place I would have rented in college."

Stayed a few nights","We booked this house for a family of 4 and a pup with the intention of visiting Acadia National Park (1+ hr drive) for a few days. Arrived to a welcome bottle of wine and lobster candies - so cute! Though the house is old and has its quirks, as stated in the listing so we knew what to expect, it is made up for in charm. The rooms are beautifully decorated, beds were comfy. The patio and hammock were my favorite places to enjoy morning coffee. We did not utilize the backyard or jacuzzi. The laundry machine came in very handy.
Best part is that the house is dog friendly and located on a dead end so it was nice and quiet. Neighborhood is safe and people were friendly whenever I walked my pup. We loved coming back at the end of a long day to rest instead of the 4 of us having to share a hotel room for a week. I think it was the perfect size for us and sharing the 1 bathroom was not a big issue, though I could see it not being adequate for larger groups.
Colleen was responsive to any messages or questions I had, and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed which was greatly appreciated! I would recommend this stay."

Stayed about a week","The house was clean and well equipped, and the beds were very comfortable. It was a shame there were no mosquito screens on doors or windows because it felt stuffy inside as we had to keep everything closed because there were a lot of mosquitos. The basement room also felt damp and I got a bad cough sleeping there for a week. The bathroom was very small and inconvenient to only have one with a group. It was good to have the washing machine and the hot tub was lovely after a long day hiking. I can’t recommend Bangor itself as a destination! I thought there would be more to do in the local area, but we ended up driving over an hour each way to Bar Harbor everyday because Bangor is a little depressing and there’s not much in the surrounding area to see. The main attractions on the road sign coming into town were the Cross Insurance Centre and the casino. That says it all. Blue Hill is also worth checking out and not too far with some nice hikes."

Stayed one night","Truly a hidden gem. Veiled from the street by a curtain of pines, this home offers a comfy but chic atmosphere that the large windows and deck elevate to a masterful sensation of bringing the outside in. The hot tub and backyard help to reverse this feeling and put the inside comfort on play in the outdoors. Besides the wonderful feeling of a well planned house, Coleen is prompt and clear in her communication and directions. She is great on adding details on taking care of the place, how to make your stay more comfortable, and takes away the stress of leaving by detailing up front all the check out instructions. For a stress-free, relaxing stay in the heart of Maine, look no further."

It felt so cozy and inviting and i would 100% stay there again. He had plenty of games for us to play as well as a highchair which I thought was very family friendly.

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Ryan’s home was excellent! We needed to travel to Bangor at the last minute and Ryan was accommodating and super responsive from the beginning.
The house was exactly as described in photos and listing and is in a great location in Bangor.
The house was spotless, the beds and sofa comfortable, and the bathrooms clean. We really enjoyed having the fenced backyard for our two pups and the toys provided kept our 2.5 year old son occupied the whole time - details like this are what really sets Ryan’s home apart and made us feel right at home!
Unfortunately the WiFi was down, as a storm had come through the day before, but Ryan went above and beyond offering to check out the router and see if it could be fixed. He even had the housekeeper bring by two baby monitors as we couldn’t use our monitors without WiFi.
We had such a great experience at Ryan’s home and we will certainly be back!
Thank you!"

No issues getting inside, and host gave directions prior and called after arrival to make sure all was good and directions on where things were and how some things worked. Loved the look and feel of the place- very homey and comfortable, but cute and chic also! Plenty of stuff for the kids to do (a whole storage shelf of toys and games, and an xbox for my oldest ) and all the necessities. Bed was very comfy, tv's in the bedroom was nice too. Kitchen was super nice and had everything you would need! Fenced in back yard is always great- would have loved to utilize it more if it wasn't rainy! The living room was our favorite place, just as nice as the pictures. Beautiful place all around and really great hosts, I'd stay again 😊 thank you!!!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is pretty perfect. The apartment is a great value compared to local hotels hands down. They have a lot of nice touches, including kitchen details, comfy furniture, local charm infused into the homey decor, and decent linens.
Admittedly, I didn’t read all the reviews before arriving nor since. Some things to note which are subjective and may or may not bother you. The entrance and front door is not lit great at night and the screen or glass door in front of the main door is in need of repair. The neighbors homes and yard cleanliness behind the place are not ideal, but once inside, you don’t see them and it’s quiet. The ceiling height in the master is very low and you’ll hit your hand if you raise it while dressing, even if you’re short, like me. The height changes in every room which is something to take note. The toilet paper is Scott tissue (less than one-ply), so that’s not awesome. Cleanup details upon checkout are easy and not overwhelming. I would recommend it."

Nicely decorated and stocked with everything you might need (towels, shampoo, toothpaste, Folgers coffee, etc). Comfy beds and GREAT living room area! New furniture. Funky layout- no two rooms are on the same level- but we got used to it quickly and didn’t notice after about half an hour. Second floor unit. Three of us were very comfortable and easily could have added a fourth person. Five star place except we had ongoing wifi issues. Floyd attempted to remedy the situation, but it didn’t work. Couldn’t use the TV and had to use our hotspots to get on the computer. Not the end of the world and we worked around it, but having Wi-Fi and a TV was something we expected. Thankfully our phones had a good signal. Otherwise a great place, good value and we recommend!"

The apartment was easy to access and was beautifully furnished. Two things that stood out especially were the wonderfully soft and comfy bed linens and the extra touch of having half and half in the fridge for our morning coffee! This made our stay extra special as we didn’t feel we had to rush out the next morning.
Thank you, the next time we come to town for a concert, we hope to stay with you again!"

Stayed a few nights","Lloyd's place was perfect for us. it was close to downtown and easy to go on a drive to the country. Including driving out to the only national park in Maine. absolutely gorgeous. The apartment was larger than expected, lots of towels, pillows and well appointed kitchen. Lloyd is super responsive. The unit is upstairs and the unit has multiple levels which has one riser so need to be careful."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay. Hurricane Lee hit while we were there and Lloyd was great about renting to us an extra night so we did not have to leave in the middle of the storm.
The only negative that I think might need to be addressed is that the apartment is nicely remodeled but you need to step up or down into several of the rooms as the floors are not all on the same level. This could be problematic for elderly people or those who have young children. Also the ceiling in the master bedroom is low, not a problem for us, but could be an issue for a taller person.
Again, Lloyd was helpful, we had a nice stay and would stay here again."

Stayed one night","Lloyd's place had both ""pros"" and a few concerns.
Pros:
- it was immaculate! So very, very clean!
- it was delightfully spacious
- the place was very well appointed
- we cooked two meals; the kitchen was well equipped
- the decor was lovely
- beds were comfortable
- communications were proactive & helpful
- for us, the location was great
Concerns include:
- in the house instructions, we were asked to bring the trash to the dumpster. I don't mean to sound privileged. Disposing of trash is not beneath me. When on vacation, and when spending $197.78 for one night, INCLUDING cleaning fee, I would hope that the cleaning person would take care of the trash.
- in 3 places, we were asked to give a five star review (if we enjoyed our stay), the guest book, an information sheet and digital messages from Lloyd
- if you are sensitive, beware of the strong laundry detergent used on the sheets
- due to a/c units windows don't open in some rooms
Overall, I do recommend this place to stay."

However, we stayed only one night of our two night stay because we smelled what we thought was a dead mouse, most likely in the walls somewhere. That is an unmistakable odor that you can't do anything about. A house that size is bound to have a mouse every so often, I understand. But it isn't something we wanted to endure another night."

Bed was comfy. I appreciated the detailed pictures on where parking and the nearby entrance door was located. Check-in was a breeze, even after dark. A note for very tall people: if you are well over 6' tall (like my son), you will have to duck your head since there is a sloped or low ceiling in some areas. Even with this in mind, we will be back again if we're in the area. The whole place was very inviting."

Stayed one night","Great stay. Clean and secure right in the heart of downtown Bangor. I will likely stay again. The only thing to be mindful of when booking is that some rooms—at least one, the one I stayed in—effectively do not have windows. There was just a mostly opaque pane of something or other behind a curtain. That’s fine; the room has ample lighting and is clean and comfortable. But probably worth knowing ahead of time. To reiterate: I had a great stay and everybody here is doing a wonderful job and I’ll be back next time I need a place to stay in the area."

My only complaint was somehow only getting booked for one night when I chose two days on the calander. Yes, I should have double-checked the invoice, but I assumed that selecting 2 days would also come with 2 nights. I'm not sure if this is an issue with the Air BnB app or the host, but it was an inconvenience. I will be sure to double-check and verify my future bookings, though. Otherwise, it is a phenomenal room for a great price!!!"

The townhome was incredibly spacious and clean with a full kitchen.. Ivy generously provided a snack basket which came in handy for our hike at Bangor City Forest and watching horror movies. Board games were also provided which my husband and I really enjoyed.
The two bedrooms were spacious, each with their own tvs and the bathroom contained a basket of needed essentials, should guests need them. We would highly recommended staying here for folks visiting Bangor"

The beds are so comfy, and the living space is cozy for watching movies or playing board games. Very clear guest instructions and helpful notes throughout the space. When I stay at Ivy's places (which is pretty regularly!), I don't stress about bringing extra stuff for every eventuality -- Ivy's properties are well stocked with most anything you could need, and a guidebook with recommendations for where to find anything you might need to pick up locally. I love the extra touches like the chocolates in the bedrooms, and the personality and humor on the guest instructions. Ivy and family take great care with their properties and it really shows.

We appreciated that the bedrooms are very similar, so it didn't feel like one of us lucked (or missed out). The hosts reached out to let us know that we could check in early which was very kind! The hosts messaged via app, text, and phone the morning we were checking out to find out our departure time.
It's a very cute and cozy bungalow, perfect for a few nights away. It's a great value. There's a sweet deck and backyard that are probably delightful in warmer weather! I enjoyed seeing a treeful of waxwings from the kitchen. Beds and pillows were comfy, though the plastic-y mattress cover meant it was a bit warm for me.
When you need a convenient Bangor location with all the basics on one floor (other than the basement laundry), this is a great place to stay!"

Stayed with a pet","I had the pleasure to stay in 2 of Rori’s homes this last week and a half. Both properties were warm and welcoming.
Jeannie was my main contact and she is the nicest woman I have met, she went out of her way to look into finding me a place through her contacts that could accommodate our 2 to 3 week needed rental. I felt totally at home,
Don’t let me forget Rene, she has her hand full with the units, and she keeps the places spotless and beautiful."

Also close to the Kenduskeag Stream Trail which is a nice walk & jog with the dog."

However, we had the idea that no one had been in the house for a long time. The smell was reasonably musty and there was dust in the bathroom (including the shelves where the shampoo is located). The heating did well, but made a lot of noise. Sometimes we woke up at night. All in all, we look back on our stay with mixed feelings."

If you're staying for multiple nights, this averages is out. We only stayed for one night, which makes the total price a bit steep. Overall, we would stay here again if it was for multiple nights where the average cost per night was less."

Experienced two snow storms while there and Rori made sure we got plowed out when we needed to be out. Overall I was pleased with this listing especially at its price point.

There was baked on grease in the bottom of the oven that started to smoke when the oven was turned on. There was brown smears on the cabinets by the cups. The air conditioner in the bedroom did not produce cold air; it just blew hot air around (maybe clean filter). There was water damage in the ceiling of the closet. The mattress was very old with no support support; I had back pain for 4 days.
We paid almost $300 for one night stay ($100 cleaning fee). Sadly we were very disappointed in our stay. Pictures taken as proof."

Stayed with a pet","Planned to stay for a long weekend to move our son in to UMaine. The goods:
Location! so close to downtown Bangor and all the coffee, food, shops you need while traveling. Also a short drive to Orono campus. All around convenient for that task.
Pet friendly: I cannot say enough how grateful I am when hosts allow dogs. We have a geriatric dog who cannot be left when we travel and I take great care to ensure we never leave a mess but it is difficult to find hotels and rentals that allow dogs. I am always immensely grateful to find a host who trusts enough to allow my dog to come along.
I was happy to see the list of cleaning requests for check out was optional/if you have time. When being charged a cleaning fee I really hate to have to clean before I leave and it seems they understand that when some hosts do not.
We did not use the kitchen or dining table, we went out for all meals.
The room- for -improvements:
Safety: I do think the code should change from guest to guest. It was really scary to think every person had the same, very insecure code to get into that house. Most places use the last 4 digits of your phone number so it feels pretty secure yet easy to remember. It was harder to get on the Wifi than in the door.
Comfort: Don't get me wrong, the home is cute. It just wasn't particularly furnished for the comforts I find necessary when travelling. I look for a comfy couch to relax after a long day of running around and a comfy bed to get a refreshing sleep. We found the beds/pillows to be really uncomfortable. I think the bed frame was a little unstable and every minor movement shook the whole bed. It was almost like being on a cot. The neighbors flood light was on all night and shining right into the bedroom. There is no shade or blind but just a curtain and it was a struggle to keep the curtain closed enough to try to block the light but also allow air from the window ac unit. I literally did not sleep at all the first night. I see that others have commented on the comfort of the bed and liking it so maybe I am too sensitive. We did depart a day early because I just really needed to sleep."

I had my little dog with me this trip and was allowed to put up a little pen in the back yard which was very convenient.
Rori and Jeanne are so easy to work with. Looking forward to staying there again in the future."

Stayed with a pet","It was fine for what we needed. They took really excellent pictures for their property; it was older than it seems in the photos. That part didn't bother us. Be careful if you bring dogs in through the back. My little dog likes to explore and didn't realize there were concrete steps leading down into the basement and he fell down every stair. He was fine, thankfully, and we just made sure they were on their leashes whenever the kitchen door was open to the back sunroom. The reason I'm leaving a 3 star review is the smell. If the a/c wasn't running on full blast, there was some kind of smell going on in the house. We both had major problems breathing in the home that we didn't have outside. I am horribly allergic to mold so I was wondering if it was coming from the basement, but there were no visible signs of that being the problem. It was visibly clean, and the owner was extremely responsive. We appreciated that. We wouldn't stay again because of our breathing issues and the smell, but otherwise it was OK. Towels and toiletries were made available and they just ask that you throw a load of laundry in when you leave which was also no problem. I also wish the code to get in the house was a little more complicated than it was. It would have made us feel safer."

Stayed a few nights","The home/space was lovely. we had no trouble finding it and it is very close to downtown Bangor. It was clean and had big bedrooms, comfortable beds and a full size kitchen. Dinning area big enough for 4 and multiple locations to sit and relax. I did yoga in the enclosed porch which has big windows and light.
Some of the restaurants we enjoyed that were all within a mile:
Pho Hoa Grill authentic Vietnamese, Moe's Original BBQ, and Unami Noodle House, choose your own Noodle bowls.
We took a day trip to Bar Harbor (about an hour) wasn't quite season yet, ate at Geddy's and sat in the park. Also the Rock and Art shop downtown is a quirky and fun gift spot.
Conclusion: Beautiful home, great value, easy communication with the host, enjoy your stay!"

The road is moderately busy, so not a great place for going for walks, but not bad when it's not a busy time (and never was very busy). We very much enjoyed having morning tea in the front room looking out over the road, watching people and dogs walking by. Very convenient location, and we would definitely stay here again."

The home is older and creaky, but clean, comfortable and got the job done as an outpost for us to visit Acadia. Only complaint is the air conditioning. The house is fashioned with 3 window units, 1 in each bedroom and 1 in the main area. The units were able to keep the house cool and comfortable during the day but at night in bed you have to choose between the cold air blowing directly on you (the bedrooms are small and beds are pushed right up to the window) or shutting it down and start sweating. That withstanding, for the price and location to downtown Bangor and short drive to Acadia, we enjoyed our stay."

While the apartment is set up for self check-in (with a well-organized binder of information), Carol greeted me in person to help me get settled and also saw me off. She provided excellent, personalized advice on restaurants, hiking in the area, weather conditions and local resources. I’m eager to return to Bangor and would love to stay here again!"

And now for the clincher: We needed to be at the Concord Coach bus center for a 7:00am bus to Portland. Had a 6:15 pickup scheduled with LYFT. By 6:25 still no LYFT. Requested UBER. Kept getting ""searching for a car"" message. When who should suddenly appear - CAROL! Loaded our luggage and off we went. I hope you don't find yourself in the same situation, but if you do ........"

On our first day, we asked her for recommendations for things to do within and outside of Acadia and she was a great resource.

The loft apartment was pristine and perfectly appointed and surprisingly private and peaceful given its great location. The balcony overlooking their garden was the perfect place to enjoy the morning sun with an amazing French-pressed cup of coffee-and she even left detailed instructions for those, like us, who were new to using it. Carol was an amazing host and made sure we had everything we needed. She even left us a scrumptious homemade banana bread when we arrived. We used at least 4 of her restaurant recommendations and each one was delicious and she gave very accurate descriptions of the location atmospheres so you knew exactly what to expect. We had an amazing experience and highly recommend staying here."

I loved the artwork, the bamboo floors, the bar/barstools, the kitchen counter/fixtures....everything was lovely, and it made me feel good just to be there. As a single woman, I felt very safe, on the second floor behind not one but two locked doors (not that the neighborhood warranted such measures, but you can never be too careful.) Carol is obviously a true hospitality pro - she greeted me warmly, made it clear that she was available, but didn't intrude; and whenever I reached out, she responded immediately. And anytime I wanted something, such as coffee, or salt, or soap, or a cutting board, I found it. She didn't miss a thing. It was truly a marvelous stay. Thank you Carol!"

Stayed a few nights","We decided to stay in Bangor for 2 nights before our big trip to Acadia. Carol was such an amazing host, our flight was delayed and we got in super late and they were flexible about check in time. The next morning we were trying to find a ride to the airport to pick-up our rental car and we couldn’t find anything online. We called carol and she answered right away and pleasantly offered us a ride to airport! That was above and beyond hospitality. The decor of the bnb was super cute, fresh and welcoming. The space was clean and full of useful amenities. There was coffee for our mornings and a tv to watch in the evenings. We enjoyed sitting on the outdoor balcony with our coffees. Thank you so much for a lovely 2 nights!"

The studio apartment was very comfortable and inviting, and it had all the key amenities we needed, plus some extra things we appreciated. Carol was a great host - very nice to talk; she provided some tips for local food and attractions in Bangor. We would certainly recommend Lofty Digs to friends, family, and others visiting Maine. There is plenty to do in the greater Bangor area, and it is not too far of a drive from Acadia."

They give so much storage for everything to be picked up, tidy and out of the way. We loved that we had were able to walk to restaurants for dinner. Marge was also the friendliest pup ever! If we didn’t have the opportunity to give her a few belly rubs we would have never known they had a dog. Would absolutely stay again!"

We came ""home"" to the loft two nights in a row and we were presently greeted by motion activated security lights. Overall, Lofty Digs is a very safe, cozy, clean, gem nestled in Bangor. If I could give 6 stars across the board I would! Highly recommend."

Very comfortable and cozy space. Felt right at home. Nice neighborhood to walk the dog in the mornings/evenings. Nice backyard and patio - too rainy to enjoy while we were there but would be a great spot to eat breakfast or sit in the evening. Easy drive to downtown (enjoyed Rocks and Art for some gifts and ate Bagel Central). Easy drive to Fort Knox which is a great way to spend the morning (good on a hot day). Overall very pleased with our stay. Would definitely use Christina's place again if we are in the area!

Stayed a few nights",Perfect to stay while visiting daughter at UMaine. 2 miles from campus. Stayed during the January blizzard and thankfully this made our stay better then staying in a hotel. We had our own bedrooms and a kitchen for cooking. A big positive was being able to park the car in the garage during the storm. Some negatives were the floors were cold which is not an issue if you have good slippers and wool socks. Also there was an issue with the hot water pipe so first thing in am we did not have hot water. Erik was quickly responsive in remedying the situation and we had hot water within an hour. Despite that issue I would recommend staying at this house.

Stayed a few nights","Okay: for full disclosure, the only reason Erik's stylish, comfortable home didn't get five stars all across is the location. We were in a bind during a visit to family in Orono, and it was not walking distance (certainly that's all on us for not booking sooner), but what the location has is a great pocket park within a short walk, the gorgeous river nearby, friendly neighbors, quiet, peace, and a great big fenced yard and garden.
Erik's place was as advertised. It looks like an older structure, perhaps, but it's been thoroughly updated. There's power wherever you want it, all the kitchen gear you're likely to need. The living/sitting room is pretty darn wonderful. We were stupidly lucky enough to arrive during the closing days of the Tour de France. We're huge fans, and plugging the laptop into the GIANT TV gave us front row seats night after night. Which also meant we did not spend enough time in the comfortable bed.
There's a small back deck off the master bedroom, and it's perfect for breakfast or lunch, watching the squirrels and birds doing their thing. In short, we loved it!
Erik was very accommodating about an early check-in to drop our luggage. No intrusions, just a solid confidence that if we needed anything, it would be handled ASAP."

Stayed a few nights","Place was really clean and comfortable for a family of 4. Very close to the college, which worked for us as we were visiting with our kid. Erik made sure we had everything we could possibly need during our stay. We definitely recommend."
