Stayed a few nights",Such a beautiful house in a great quiet location tucked in the trees. The neighborhood was great and Kathys house was perfect spot to relax after travel and activities. The back porch is amazing with birds chirping and deer roaming outside of back yard fence on property. Everything was clean and in working order. The beds were very comfortable and couch and lounging chair. Huge tv in living room as well. I would highly recommend kathys house.

Stayed with kids","Kathy has a lovely home and a large peaceful backyard with comfortable rockers so that you can enjoy the Oklahoma evening breeze and a beautiful sunset after a long day. The home had everything we needed to make our stay an enjoyable one including a computer desk, propane grill, dishwasher, robot vacuum, & plenty of extra blankets and towels. There are 4 of us and we all had plenty of room without feeling like we were on top of one another, which is always appreciated when you’re traveling with children. I spent a good bit of time soaking in the jacuzzi tub and reading a book for some much needed alone time. We would absolutely stay here again."

It was so cute and everything was just what we needed to make our ""Sister"" trip perfect. We did alot of shopping, but mostly stayed right there in the bungalow and visited. The place was so comfortable and relaxing. Jana was just as sweet as she could be and so helpful!!"

Stayed a few nights","Saying that I enjoyed my time staying in this place would be an understatement. It is nice and quiet as it is located in a peaceful neighborhood. The check-in was quick and easy and Jana made sure I had everything I needed throughout my stay. She even measured the bathroom door for me before I arrived to make sure my wheelchair would fit through; this really meant a lot to me. It's a very accessible home and the decor is absolutely stunning. Organized, spacious, clean, relaxing, and serene are just a number of words I can use to describe this lovely home. I was also able to use the TV to watch my Dallas Mavericks play against the OKC Thunder in the playoffs. The dining room table was huge and allowed me to spread out and work accordingly. This place is amazing and I'm hoping to come back sometime in the future.
Thank You Jana!"

I cannot say enough nice things. They loved the beds, the kitchen had everything that they needed, and there was ample seating for the whole family both in the living area and the dining area. Everything about being here was easy; it was something we really appreciated even more during a trying time."

She was very welcoming. ￼And she was accommodating for my service dog. ￼
Overall extremely clean house, and the kitchen was in A+ 100!
I would absolutely stay there over and over again. ￼
And the double driveway was a plus, so my coworker and I would not get into the way of one another.
If you’re on business, especially with other people, this is your place!"

The house was spacious and homey. We were in walking distance to downtown, where we found nice shops and a couple of neat eating places. A quick drive down the road took us to a grocery store and a park for the kids. There are many shopping and eating establishments to choose from in Duncan. We were extremely happy with our experience and are planning the bungalow for our vacation again next year. Jana was very kind and quick to respond."

Spacious with plenty of room to move around, but also with ample seating.
Nicely decorated and stocked kitchen.
Comfortable beds for restful sleeping.
Smart tv to watch a movie or shows.
Yahtzee board game to have a game night.
Front porch has a swing and chair to enjoy your morning coffee.
Side yard was good size to play catch (baseball/football).
Great place to stay while in Duncan"

Just arrived from a long flight followed by a long drive and this was just perfect for me to start my adventure road trip.
The Tiny House is super cute and very well stocked up with everything and more.
The outside and the surrogate beautiful.
Traci is fantastic, helpful and genuine a very lovely person.
When I made the reservation I asked her if she could remove something from the accommodation because it would have made me feel uncomfortable and she removed it without any question or hesitation.
This is what I call a Super Host.
I highly recommend this lovely Tiny House you won’t be disappointed.

So this place gave me and my husband the luxury of a fully stocked kitchen as far as appliances and pots and pans. The back yard is amazing. We nearly lived out there. This place is amazing. And Tracy the host is very responsive. Will definitely recommend to friends and family as well as rent this space again if I need to."

Stayed with a pet","The description of Traci’s place was very accurate. It’s in a rural setting, but literally just a couple minutes from town. Comfortable, attractive, and clean. Fun touches everywhere—we loved it—inside and out. Our dog was welcome, too, which is a great selling point for us. Roomy, fully-fenced (and mowed) backyard with great patio spaces where one can slow down for a bit, sit, listen to the crickets and frogs or watch the fireflies at dusk. We were just passing through for one night as part of a longer road trip, but we would purposely seek Traci’s place out if we were going to be anywhere near again, and add a couple or few days to our stay just for the enjoyment of it!"

Loved it being hidden but still close! Traci was super nice and actually super responsive when I had a question she even called to make sure all was okay! Above and beyond host!

The back yard is fully fence and feels private with plenty of inviting places to relax under large shade trees. We bring our dog to Airbnb’s a lot and this was the first place I felt she was truly welcome. Host was amazing! We would definitely stay again!!

My own Airbnb was booked so they couldn’t stay there so the tiny house was available and close to my house . It was a great size . Perfect for their small dogs. They said the bed was comfy . The tiny house stayed nice and cool . The house has everything they needed . The drive way was big and easy to fit their travel van. We enjoyed sitting on the back patio visiting and the backyard is all fenced in safely for their small dogs . A great place to stay . Thank you Traci ."

Stayed one night","Traci's Tiny House is the perfect get away with all the comforts of home. Oliver (the dog) gives it two paws up! His favorite - the backyard with the fire pit and chairs for his human to relax. Me (the human), I give it 2 thumbs up. My favorite - the welcoming sign on the side of the old Plymouth in the front yard!
Seriously, Traci has a wonderful home to share and I am already planning my next stay in the Spring/early Summer. Description and pictures of the property are exactly what you experience and the directions were perfect as our arrival was right after nightfall and I can no problem finding it. Traci had left the lights on for us and we felt like we were visiting a good friend's home. I highly recommend the Tiny House to anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing stay while in the area."

The only problem we had the first day was that the water heater wasnt as large as we were accustomed. We scheduled our showers to be a little over an hour apart and had no problems afterward. The place was cozy and welcoming. We had a wonderful stay and would rent here if we needed to visit this area again.

We've never stayed in an Airbnb that was so well equipped with information about the local area and personal items a person might need while traveling (toothpaste, razors, Q-Tips, etc). Traci was easy to communicate with, and we appreciated that her list of rules was short and simple (at some places it's like reading a novel)! We would definitely stay there again."

Plus, if you like to bird watch, there are painted buntings(!), hummingbirds, red headed woodpeckers, cardinals, chickadees, titmouse, Guinea fowl, hawks, etc. around! I'd recommend bringing or getting a plastic hummingbird feeder and bringing some sugar to make the nectar if you come during late Spring-Summer. We put up our own bird feeder for the other birds, and also made our own birdbath out of an upside down frisbee...super classy, LOL. The neat downtown square in Duncan is best enjoyed during the week or earlier on Saturday, as everything shuts down early on Saturday and is closed on Sunday (so, we missed much of the stores). Eat at Bob's Landmark Eatery--thanks to our host, we did and it was delicious! Great stay, we hope to visit again!"

Stayed with a pet","The Tiny House is the perfect choice for a couple who enjoys spending time in the Duncan area. The house is new and quite cleverly designed and constructed. There are several upgrades (antique furnishings) and many personal decor touches. It has a cozy and comfy vibe. The 2 out door spaces are excellent for grilling (new grill), eating outside, and hanging out. The yard has a privacy fence on the north and the wooded area behind the west chain link fence gives an open-outdoor-wooded feel while keeping the dog in the yard.
The house is cozy and the space, albeit small, is designed to be functional for a nice stay. We can’t wait to go back. 💙"

The second “bedroom” is very comfortable but it does not have a door and doesn’t offer privacy.
Therefore, if you are staying in the third bedroom, you have to walk through the second room to get to the rest of the house.
It’s a 2 bedroom with an additional area with a sleeping space."

Looking forward to the next trip to Duncan. We were 2 older woman and an elderly lady. This place isn’t for little kids. Which she states. There is a game room older kids might enjoy though. But the place is furnished with lots of wonderful knick knacks. I’d be terrified to bring my grandkids, lol. The third bedroom is a walk through of the second bedroom so the only privacy is the master. So be sure people are comfortable without privacy."

As they say in the UK, the home is kitted out with amenities.
The quiet location is great for visiting downtown and museums, including family history center. The Wishbone Scratch Kitchen restaurant at the golf course is open to the public and one of my favorites.
We look forward to returning as soon as our schedule allows."

Just by chance, right across the street was the Little Gem Air BnB. It was almost too good to true. We inquired as to it's availability and was joyed to find it was open. The host Linda and Bill where there to save the day. They both worked hard at making our stay as comfortable as possible. The house is lavishly furnished and has everything a family would need. The beautiful house so perfect in every detail, from the freshly cut tulips on the coffee table to the large spacious back yard. If your traveling for business or pleasure in or around Duncan Oklahoma, the Little Gem is your home away from home. Thank's Linda and Bill for being our family when we needed it."

Stayed with kids","I loved it. It was too nice, in my opinion, for all of the kids we had. All between ages 3 and 4 (I didn't want them to break anything.)Unfortunately the kids got sick while at my Dads and only came for the last 2 nights of our stay. They has a blast, but the beds are high for small kids. We had one small issue but when we messaged about it, they were there within maybe 10-30 minutes. I was sleepy so i wasnt watching the clock. My mom is wheelchair bound so i found the best bedroom for her was the back room so we could get her in an entrance without too much struggle. There is a small issue of the middle room having no solid doors so there isnt much privacy. And the master room could not close all the way. Me and my husband slept there. Not having the privacy we are used to kind of bummed us out, but we still loved how nice the room was. The back yard is also amazing. Even though I did not get as much time back there, I loved the look. I would definitely recommend, in fact, I did."

There are so many cozy places to relax…inside and out. The beds are very comfortable and the bedding was luxurious. It truly felt like home away from home. We can’t say enough about how blessed we were to stay here. We will definitely return.

Stayed with kids",This is the first Airbnb I’ve ever rented and I was so pleasantly surprised! The hosts truly have a beautiful home and it was an honor to stay there. They are such genuinely kind people I don’t think we could have found a better place or a better host. The house has absolutely everything you could need or want. When I mentioned that my kids found malt glasses but no blender they dropped a new blender off so we could make shakes! It was such a kind thoughtful gesture and it was so appreciated. The backyard is beautiful and we got to enjoy it several days and evenings. The house is very clean and very comfortable. There’s plenty do like books games puzzles tv porch swing… the rooms are spacious and comfortable. My only issue is that I had to leave lol seriously I have zero complaints and was so happy with my stay

A much better value for the money over Duncan’s overpriced hotels, we’ll definitely stay here again. Heartily recommend thoroughly reading the notes from December about Duncan’s addresses when you book—your GPS can get confused. Other than that, it’s beautiful, cozy and homey. Wish we’d stayed longer. Next time!"

Apartment was beautifully furnished, quiet and tastefully updated with modern amenities respectful to the original building architecture.
One of our favorite touches was the converted closet office by the sitting area. It was a great spot for making a few calls and getting caught up on email.
Cannot say enough about this fun stay and really look forward to trying out the other three rooms."

My husband & one year old all stayed & felt like we had plenty of room! There was a perfect spot in the back to pop up his travel crib so it’s works for a small family, couples or just on your own!! They have the bathroom stocked with any & everything you could have forgotten.. you can tell they put a lot of thought & care into the place!! I’ll definitely be trying out the other rooms they have there when I make another trip back to Duncan bc they all look just as perfect as the Rose!!"

It is an older home with its quirks as the listing states, but it was decorated with lovely furnishings, spacious and very comfortable. We love to cook, and the kitchen is well-equipped. We chose to sleep in the blue room, and the bed was very comfortable. This would be a great place to stay whether for a short trip or longer time. There is a desk, and washer and dryer in a room off of the kitchen. We wished we could have stayed longer, and would love to come back. The community seemed to have a number of restaurants and things to see. We did find a cute smoothie bar located inside a martial arts studio!"

The game spaces and hot tub are such a bonus and kept our teens and kids busy. The kitchen is adequately stocked and allowed us to fix meals for our extended group. We didn’t request anything from Susan but she did check on us and offered help if we needed anything. We will be back the next time we stay in Duncan!

We celebrated a life well lived and toasted the next generation while sheltered in a beautiful home that provided everything we could possibly need. Thank you, Susan, for helping turn the unbearable into a cherished piece of family lore."

Stayed with kids","My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We traveled with a group of 11 ranging in age from 3 to 77. The multiple common areas were very accommodating allowing for different groups to do their own thing but still be in close proximity to each other. It provided the perfect togetherness without being on top of each other. We could relax on the side porch or in the back grill area. We enjoyed the ping pong as well as the pool table. We spent time in the dining/living room just hanging out with games, books and snacks. The kitchen was sufficient and the den was a favorite spot for movies. The kids enjoyed the bunk room being upstairs, giving them a space to be a little loud and rowdy away from parents and grandparents. We also had easy access to the pool across the street. The pool did have some debris but nothing too disruptive and obviously not in the host’s control. We would definitely book again. Susan communicated well and was reasonably available and accommodating."

Stayed with kids","This was a great house for our family New Year celebration! The pool table was a huge hit. We did buy chalk, there wasn’t any. My grandbabies enjoyed the hot tub! The kitchen does not have a small mixer or potato masher but we made do with what they have. My grown children brought bikes to ride with their children. They parked them in the back yard. (Only to be seen by the neighbors; chain link fence on that side) Two of the bikes were stolen, not the fault of the owner, just saying if you bring any bikes be sure to put them in the garage which we did after the bikes were stolen. Maybe a lock on that gate would deter this from happening.
There were mixed feeling about the beds…I slept fine.
Great weekend get a way!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great time here. House was located right across the street from the country club and we did use the pool at the club without any issues. The pool was a lot of fun and the kids had a blast! It was a great location for our family going on and out of town to various functions.
The house was spacious and able to sleep most of our family members. The bunk bed room allowed the kids to stay together, which they loved!
The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars was because the only bedroom that was connected to a bathroom was the kid’s room. It was the largest bathroom. The other bedrooms did not connect to a bathroom. It was hard to tell this on the listing. This turned off several older family members as 3 rooms share 1 upstairs bathroom.
However, the rooms were tastefully decorated and spacious. The beds and bedding were super comfortable! There were plenty of seating areas and entertaining things to do. We enjoyed drinking coffee in the morning on the balcony overlooking the golf course.
The best part of the house is the poker room where we spent nights talking and playing cards!
All-in-all, we had a great time and the house was a perfect meeting-up place for our family. We definitely enjoyed our stay there and would stay again!"

It was very reasonably priced and had more than enough space for our family.
We played a lot of pool while we were waiting for other family to finish the responsibilities of preparing the actual funeral, which gave us a much needed distraction.
The hot tub was primed and ready to go, although we did not indulge. The poker room was awesome too.
Fantastic communication from the owner and we will definitely use this home again whenever we need to return to Duncan to visit our remaining family members."

The bedrooms are very spacious. I really liked the fresh eucalyptus in the shower! The water pressure isn't the greatest in the master bathroom. The outside space was nice to talk with family and enjoy a meal together. We had family bring over food so we didn't use the kitchen but the stove looked awesome to cook on. We would like to have a girls weekend there next summer. The lock on the door is coded and that challenged the kids who thought it was like the old cell phone texting. Lol! Plenty of parking space in a quiet neighborhood.

Stayed with kids",Beautiful home. The pictures are very accurate. It's very spacious and cozy. The kitchen is well stocked and the stove is beautiful. Although we didn't use it because we didn't cook. Moms need a break too. 😂 It's a very quiet neighborhood. We loved the pool especially for our kids. The pool house also had a lot of pool floaties and a pump if needed. There is also a grill in the backyard. We didn't use it but it was great to have one if we wanted to. We loved that there was a bathroom and refrigerator by the pool. So we didn't have to track water in and out of the house. The only complaint was We couldn't get one side of the hot tub to work. Which wasn't a big deal. However PLEASE use caution when turning on the water anywhere in the house. It is extremely hot. There should be a warning because I mean burn yourself hot. I would definitely recommend this home and would stay here again. Spend the money. It's worth it.

The pool area has two decks for sitting, one with a firepit. One area gets great shade all day. Half of the pool is shaded in the morning. The pool is quite large and there is also a hot tub. The owner has provided pool towels and toys.
The neighborhood is very safe. The house is just up the street from the Country Club and convenient to the main area of town and the grocery store. The owner is very responsive. We would book this property again!"

We loved how much room there was to sit in in different areas of the house and in the backyard. I also loved the look of the house with all the updates they did. It was a mini vacation away from home and a beautiful setting to reunite with family. We had so much fun. We also appreciated how quickly Susan responded to a question we had. We will definitely stay there again the next time our family wants to meet up in Duncan!

Stayed with kids","Our stay in Duncan was nice. ****If you are going for graduation from Fort Sill**** The home is outside their permitted travel area. They are permitted 20 miles and are told to stay within the Lawton area, this house is 30+ miles from base. The home was mostly as described. The pool is not heated, so I definitely feel this should be stated in the description. That way you know it is not usable except for in summer months. I also feel the price should reflect this. They definitely have drainage issues at the house. Our first night there we had to stand in 3 inches of water to shower. The property management was great and left us some drain crystals on the porch to use and they did help. The home was clean and furnishings we're nice. Loved their waffle towels!"

The kids LOVED the pool (complete with floaties), mom and dad loved being poolside - the backyard is like a resort!! Mornings in the backyard were so peaceful and dreamy. Another kid favorite was the arcade! Everything was crisp and clean. Very spacious. We make a trip to Duncan, Ok once a year and we cannot wait to stay here again!

Gorgeous decor throughout - it could totally have been styled by Joanna Gaines. Everything was well thought out and very spa-like. Beds and linens were so luxurious and comfy, we had to get the names of brands! And the backyard was just dreamy. Would definitely rebook if I ever find myself back in that area.

The space is decorated very well and was very comfortable for my family of three. Would highly recommend booking for your Duncan stay!

Stayed over a week","Stayed 5 weeks for work at Duncan Hospital. The place was clean and cozy! It had everything needed during a long stay with plenty of extras. Teresa and Dave were both very friendly. The place is right up the street from parks, the grocery store, police station, and restaurants. The hospital and walmart are both less than a 10 min drive. Tim’s Place has the best biscuit Ive ever eaten!!! The breakfast is delicious I had the Cowboy Biscuit! “Duncan Donuts” has tasty donuts and I really enjoyed the jalapeño/cheese sausage roll. Duncan is near two wildlife refuges, both worth a visit, lots of bison and beautiful Longhorns at Wichita refuge. Also enjoyed floating on Lake Latonka and seeing a movie at the historic Vaska theater. This little town stole my heart."

Stayed a few nights","I was in Duncan for work, and the place was a perfect respite. The space was so clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well appointed, and the washer and dryer saved me from a trip to the laundromat.
I loved the backyard with the string lights, seating, and grill & wish I could have made use of it but I was too busy with work.
I was lucky enough to make use of the claw foot bathtub on my last day, and highly recommend anyone staying to do the same.
It was so comfortable I booked an extra night. Don’t miss the opportunity to stay at this gem. I hope to stay again if I come back for work.
Thanks so much for a lovely stay, Teresa & Dave!"

I had a very busy and trying week of work and returning to the cottage in the evenings, or when I was on a break, was a respite of peace and quiet. I felt so comfy and at home. It was beautifully decorated and so clean, and all the little amenities were thoughtful and helpful. The kitchen was particularly filled with the little things that you need when throwing a breakfast or lunch together. My hosts were readily available and super helpful. All in all, what could’ve been a miserable week was made much much easier because of Foxhollow Cottage. Oh…and the bed is huge and super comfortable! I highly recommend this little gem!"

The decor was one of my favorite accents of the Nest. I definitely was thankful to have a full kitchen amenities and a washer and dryer. A few times there I would wake up in the night to car loud car engines going by, but other than that, the view from the stairway balcony was peaceful. Very clean, and comfortable and I felt very much at home. I am glad I brought my own blanket because the ones that were in their bins were a bit rough feeling. Eating dinner with the barstool and the kitchen counter was the only uncomfortable seating place for meals. Overall, I highly recommend the Byrd Nest, and would stay there again."

The pillows and the bed and the sheets and blankets and the throws were sheer Heaven. The bathroom was a spa. I sent pictures of the place home to my sister-in-law and my daughter. It was just a delightful week there. So very comfortable. Snacks, drinks in the fridge, sonic ice! And also ice trays. Which were filled when I got there and frozen! Ha ha. I highly recommend this place. Very good communication with the hosts."

We took a cool shower the first day, but we were able to figure the faucet out the 2nd day and had a nice hot shower.

Stayed with a pet","What a beautiful place to stay! We were there on a family trip for a local function. Pam made us right at home. Cabin is spacious, beautifully decorated, and impeccably appointed. We felt right at home with lots of quilts and beautiful leather furniture to lounge away. There are lots of little amenities you wouldn’t even think of, but were much appreciated. One was a fresh bag of ice waiting for us, which I love since I drink a lot of iced tea. We brought along our 12 week old puppy and there was lots of nice grass for potty breaks. Five pretty doe came right up to the fence by the back door to greet me in the morning. The one thing I would say is hard to tell in the pictures is how spacious this place is. The bathroom and shower are quite large and the main room, with it’s open concept, is also large with a separate area for living room, bedroom, and kitchen.
We already plan to stay there when we go back to Duncan next year!"

She showed me all around, and where all the lights and amenities were. There was a storm during the evening and she made sure I felt safe. The house is very close to the barn, but I didn’t feel watched or that I was looked upon at all. The pool is excellent!! Very well kept. Beautiful! As is the whole property! And SO very clean! The only BNB I didn’t wear my slippers at! The cleanest bathroom I’ve stayed at! Again, I felt very safe and very comfortable. It was extremely relaxing and just what I needed.

Internet was out the entire stay due to a recent storm but the lovely hostesses brought a box of DVDs for us to watch. We loved watching the deer out off the back patio, the leaves change color and the sound of the running fountain nearby. The inside of the barn is gorgeous and has a romantic feel with clear string lights on the ceiling. The place was spotless, tidy and felt comfy & cozy. I recently had a knee replacement and the walk-in shower was perfect! (Trying to get over a tub wall is torture.) The entire weekend was something we both needed, relaxing and stress-free! Would definitely book here for peace, relaxation & spending quiet time as a couple again. Thank you for allowing us to stay on your beautiful property!"

Lovely patio, porch and pool, as well as comfy accommodations. Communications were top notch and the owners were very welcoming. We will definitely be back.

Not only were we able to do all of his care in the cozy comfort of this beautiful place, but also even a couple treatments on the sunshiny outdoor patio area! We BBQ’d, had plenty of room, comfort, relaxing and romantic atmosphere to take us far from home, while only being 10 minutes away! The picturesque decor and country feel are spot on! We will definitely be back! 100% recommended! Lois, thank you for your kindness and hospitality!!

There’s not many amenities in kitchen like stove to cook but I didn’t need it for this stay. There is a microwave and refrigerator which was perfect. Other amenities were great. Bathroom with wonderful shower head helped start off day. My dog Lola enjoyed property too with plenty space for her to walk around. Response time communicating with host was excellent.
Next time I’m in area I’ll definitely come back especially during warmer months to take advantage of pool. It looked very inviting.

If so, do yourself a favor and book this spot now! The magic of this beautifully decorated barn is not just the rustic decor but also the obvious care, warmth, and charisma the owners bring to the space. The interior is absolutely exquisite with hand-finished reclaimed wood planks on the walls, black and white checkerboard tile in the bathroom, and exposed rafters strung with lights you can switch on that make it look like you are sleeping under a starry sky. The open floor plan boasts delightfully comfy sofas and an amazing old-fashioned leather recliner, a retro dining table, a vintage piano to plink around on, plus a flat-screen TV complete with DVD player and WiFi. The kitchen has a full-sized fridge and sink, toaster oven, microwave, and Keurig coffee maker with all the fixings. The farmhouse bed is comfy and has plenty of pillows. The walk-in shower has excellent water pressure, plenty of hot water, and a tiled bench. Out back there is a patio perfect for grilling, complete with a table and umbrella for meals or just hanging out, and a chimenea. The chimenea is fully stocked and ready to go; it only took one match to light (seriously, it was impressive!). The salt-water pool out front is beautifully maintained, ranges from around 3 to 10 feet deep (with a diving board at the deep end), and has plenty of places to lounge and relax. The covered patio is perfect for long conversations day or night. I could go on and on, but the best part is that these folks are some of the best people you could hope to meet! Lois and Pam are thoughtful, considerate, good-hearted people who genuinely enjoy sharing their excellent venue with others. Bottom line: if you like taking it easy in beautiful natural surroundings and rustic luxury provided by a couple of amazing people, book this spot today!"

Stayed one night","Best night's sleep in months for both of us. Peaceful, clean, thoughtful, and simply perfect for a couple who want the closeness of a town but the serenity of the country life. btw...the shower in this place is the BEST!"
