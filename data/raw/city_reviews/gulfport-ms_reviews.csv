Stayed a few nights","Mia and her husband were amazing host, the place is beautiful, spacious , very convenient and comes with everything you need. My cupcake was EVERYTHING; they were very moist and flavorful from SmallCakes downstairs! The Mardi Gras parade came right in front of the place so we had no problem getting beads! Whenever I’m back in Gulfport and not staying at the casino, your place is at the top of my list. Thank you Mia and Hubby for the hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","The Cozy Brick was perfect for our time in Gulfport! Charles met us at check-in and was super friendly - showing us around the apartment and offering recommendations on places to go/see/eat.
The apartment was clean, spacious, and in a perfect location to walk around and explore Gulfport (& a short, gorgeous drive to Biloxi). I absolutely loved the exposed brick walls, and my husband's favorite part was the skylights. :)
We would definitely recommend Mia & Charles's place to anyone looking to stay in Gulfport, and would be more than happy to stay there again!"

I would HIGHLY recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, place to stay that’s walking distance to pizza, wine, oysters and of course, the cupcake shop below !!
Thank you to Mia and her husband for prompt correspondence and making sure we were comfortable ! Loved the balcony and took advantage of it in the evenings !

Charles met us at the site, showed us everything and then actually walked me and my 81 year old Mom around the corner to the restaurant where we were meeting my brother. The house was superclean.

Stayed a few nights","Honestly, this was the worst AirBnB experience my family has ever had.
I can only give it 2 stars- 1 for location and 1 for cleanliness.
Things you should know before booking that are not plainly listed in description:
1. Only street parking is available for this location and it is limited to 2 hours during the weekdays until 6PM.
2. The owners bathroom only has a tub- no shower. The only shower option is a 4sq. ft. stall shower located in the second bathroom.
3. There are ~20 stairs that you have to walk up to access the apartment. It may not be ideal if you’re bringing a lot of items or have decreased mobility.
It’s clear that the host has tried to make the space nice but there are several small things that could be done to make the experience significantly better. There were only 6 towels that were provided to us- all mismatched and stained (plus just one hand towel for two bathrooms and a handful of washcloths). The living room has no side tables or coffee table, so if you have a drink while sitting on the couch you have to set it on the floor. At least 3 lightbulbs were burned out. We were only provided with 1/2 a roll of toilet paper per bathroom for the weekend. The window/mini-split AC units are all loud and inefficient and woke us up throughout the night. The Wifi was spotty.
Check-in is supposed to be at 3PM. We messaged the seller just before 2PM and told her that we did not expect to be let in early but would like to be let in right at 3:00. At 3:00 there was no one there to meet us so we called twice, knocked on the door- all with no answer. At 3:15 she called to ask where we were, but never apologized for being late or missing our calls. We also contacted the host one time during our stay to ask a question and she said she would call back with an answer but never did. That’s just not kind or professional.
I would never recommend this to a friend or consider staying there again."

Walking distance to many great restaurants and attractions (Sully's, Chandeleur Island Brewing, Half Shell Oyster House, Perk's, and, of course, Smallcakes and SeaGrapes downstairs). Easy walk to the Aquarium, as well. Despite being downtown, the stay was very quiet and safe. Would highly recommend and will likely stay again!"

The apartment is located on the second level with a cute and yummy cupcake shop below. It’s well insulated as we barely heard street noise and never heard the business below.
We walked to the beach where there is a long walking trail and white sand beaches.
Excellent restaurants and an outlet mall are all nearby.

Let Mia know if you have any issues and she will take care of it right away. And the value is great too- the same week-long stay at our usual hotel was charging $200 more. Great place, great location, great host, great value. Stay here, you'll love it."

Stayed with kids","Blueberry Hills is a quintessential Southern beach oasis. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Check in was easy. Parking to unpack the car is literally steps from the door. The ocean view from the French doors, screened-in porch and pool area is beautiful. The home is tastefully decorated and has the tallest doors I have ever seen. Literally, if you are 7’8”, you’ll have clearance. There was no extensive check out list or to do list for us to complete while we were there. The trash can was magically taken to the road on Monday morning and brought back up after the trash was hauled away. Ken even stopped by to check on our stay, but sadly, we weren't there. You can easily walk to the beach or the Discovery Center. It is in such a cute neighborhood and I felt totally at ease letting my children play in the yard. My only wish is there were summer dates available because this would be our go to rental. Thank you Ken and Tanya. We had a wonderful stay."

It had everything we needed including towels, fool floaties, toys, games, and lots of kitchen essentials. The home was super clean and beautiful. The home owner stopped by to help us learn how to heat the pool, showed us how to work the gas fireplace outside and even bought us pizza. One of the BEST airbnbs we have ever stayed in. Highly highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Excellent stay! We had the best time. Place was as described and pictured. Some highlights for us: master bath in the master bedroom was amazing, love the huge shower. The queen pull out couch is in a small front living room which is somewhat separate from other spaces and main living room so it feels really doable to use as a “bedroom” space. Having laundry right in the main space. The beach cruiser bikes are so great. Having beach chairs, umbrella, beach toys and wagon to pull it all was really appreciated so we didn’t have to pack and travel with those. The beach is two blocks from the house. You do have to cross busy Hwy 90, but it’s very easy and doable, just watching closely the traffic. That section of the beach was so private, had very few people sharing it with us. Recommend going to local fresh fish market to get shrimp, etc to cook in the spacious kitchen! If we ever make it back to MS, would definitely stay again!"

They claim that it was treated. But the house was still filthy when we were supposed to return. We have pictures of everything. We left after only 5 weeks . We owe hundreds of dollars from doctors bills and prescriptions. Sorry we all had to go through this “together “."

Stayed with kids","Absolutely a ""home away from home"" experience. From the moment we walked in, it was the most stress-free, and relaxed trip we've ever had. The icing on the cake was all of the little conveniences that are alreadyin the house - dishes, pots, baking sheets, etc. as well as the bits you accidentally forget to pack, such as dryer sheets or hair dryer stuff. We didn't find ourselves in need of anything like we usually do on trips. All of this on top of the literal handful of minutes to the beach walk and the very quiet and peaceful neighborhood surrounding Shady Oaks. Jeremy and Katrina were very friendly and proactive getting in touch with us to ensure we were good before we checked in, through our check out. This was our first AirBnB, and it couldn't have been better."

I brought a Matt topper so I was able to have some comfort. I Wouldn’t even put kids on there. The toilet seat was broken and tilted. I just had a hip replacement and it was awkward to use. I don’t understand why there’s a cleaning fee of $100 it obviously wasn’t done before we stayed there. Plus I had to collect sheets and blankets and put them on top washer. Bring garbage to curb and load dishwasher. So what’s with the $100 fee. It should be something included in the price of rent. Location and safety was spot on. Parking was good to.

It was also a perfect location for a quick day trip to New Orleans, which our kids loved. Jeremy and Katrina were extremely helpful and responsive. We would certainly consider returning in the future."

Jeremy and Katrina are thoughtful and kind hosts. They were incredibly responsive on any questions and were so kind. They have equipped the house with all sorts of beach equipment (e.g., carts, chairs, sand castle supplies, boards, bikes, etc) so you can enjoy really any activity you desire out there."

This house is so close to the gulf, you can enjoy coffee from the front or back yard with beautiful views! Close enough my young children could easily walk to the beach. The best sand on a beach ever and great shallow water for exploring. The house was so well equipped we barely had to bring anything but clothes and food! They even provided great beach gear including a cart, chairs and bikes. It was super clean and really nice touches everywhere. Gulfport is an amazing gem and this house was like a dream come true!"

We also ventured east to Dauphin Island, also super quiet bc of cold weather - which was just fine with us.

Huge backyard with the oak trees making it so perfect to spend time in. Great locaton so close to the beach. They communicated real well and check in was a breeze. They even notified us about the house being ready hours early. I can go on and on, but overall it was a great experience."

The fenced and lit backyard was a plus and wonderful for our dogs to get out unleashed to exercise. We appreciated the easy walk to catch breathtaking sunsets although crossing the major highway was a bit of a hassle. Unfortunately, a new housing development obstructed the direct view of the Gulf which was slightly disappointing, but the neighborhood was friendly , which added to our experience."

There was a concrete driveway and room to park underneath the roof so we could load and unload our car and not get rain on us. A flatscreen smart TV in all three bedrooms and a fourth large TV in the living room. If we find ourselves in Gulfport again, we will be staying at the same place."

We had most of our meals at home and the kitchen is well equipped for cooking. The best point of this home is the location: 2 blocks from the beach and a very easy walk. David provides a notebook with tips about activities for the area and we referred to it often. There was a sweet surprise box of cookies to greet us! Our stay in Gulfport could not have been better!"

Its a beautiful home , very clean and inviting . The hosts are awesome . Left us a welcome basket with snacks and beer for the hubby which he loved. A cute sign welcoming the family with our names . The kitchen has everything to cook full dinner I just brought a Turkey roster. They have lots of amenities shampoos and soaps , laundry detergent and lots of towels . All cleaning products kept at site which I love bc I can clean up while staying there . The upstairs room is beautiful with the best view! Only downside the jet tub doesn’t work which is disclosed before and there is no table for 4. There is seating outside for 4 but just a barrel so we could not eat together at a table but tray tables provided. Upstairs bed is like a dream . Elevator was a little iffy but worked for luggage and helpful . Porch views are gorgeous! We will be back"

The views are amazing, early November was a really peaceful time in Long Beach. We toured Nola and then came to the beach to rest. Communication was great. Well maintained and clean."

Stayed a few nights",We loved our stay at The Nest. The location was great. Lots close by or close enough to drive 30 min west or east to antique shops and unique dining. The house was very clean and had lots of wonderful hand picked touches by the owners to make our stay enjoyable! Beds were comfy and love the bedjet. Enjoyed drinks in the evening and coffee in the morning in the front porch to catch the sunrise/sunsets with Beautiful and unobstructed views. Lovely welcome basket. Close to house next door but still very private; never heard the neighbors. Enjoyed our stay very much.

We enjoy our morning and evening adult drinks on the desk with a nice gulf breeze. The bedroom on main floor is a bit small but ok for a smaller couple or kids. House was stocked with everything you could need. The beach was right across the street and for a holiday weekend very quiet. The house's decor was amazing and thank you for all the goodie and drinks came in handle after a long night at the casino. Can't wait to book again.

Stayed with kids","The place was nice in clean beautiful view. The restrictions made me feel like, I was on pins and needles. Such as , If you not upstairs turn the air off or if you not outside the car porch lights has to be cut off. Both of the jacuzzi don't work. I feel like if you paying top pay everything should be working. And Airbnb should be like just like a hotel but better. But overall I love the place just hate, I couldn't get in the jacuzzi. But we made sure that we left everything with good standards. As me being landlord, I wouldn't want no one to leave my home in bad conditions. But we still enjoyed ourselves and made the best of every moment. Thanks..."

Stayed a few nights",The house was beautiful and perfect for our needs. Very much a relaxing beach vibe to the home with amazing view of the gulf. Krista and Jordan made it very easy to get in and out and were responsive in communication. The only issue that caught us by surprise was the very heavy and constant traffic on the four lane highway between the house and the beach. It was quite noisy. But not much that can be done about that. Just know going in that it won’t be the blissful beach experience like most resorts offer. Other than that the house is exceptional.

Stayed a few nights","The Nest was a perfect home base for myself, my husband, and our two teens to spend the last week of our winter break!
In general, The Nest was very clean and had modern updates throughout the entire home. We most enjoyed how incredibly close we were to the beach and that it was centrally located for fun day trips to Biloxi and New Orleans. It was also nice to have off-street parking, comfy beds and couches, bath tubs, a plethora of towels, extra toiletries, and a well equipped kitchen. We also appreciated how thoughtful the hosts were with a welcome message, basket of snacks, and adult refreshments.
Long Beach itself did not disappoint (nor did its neighboring beach towns), and we were incredibly lucky to have near-80° temps in late December. The beach here has lovely, soft white sand, and the section right in front of the house was almost always quiet. It is quite shallow, but we enjoyed all the bird watching and exploring that the sand bars created. The sunrises and sunsets were great. Highway 90 is quite busy, but it was not a big deal for us to load the car and take it to parking right across the street for an easy trip.
We would definitely come back and stay again!"

The hosts were fabulous responding to our requests. We enjoyed the welcome basket, nice touch, when arriving at the destination after driving 8 hours.
Thank you Krista and Jordan for allowing us to stay at The Nest! We had a wonderful time! Be well, stay safe."

Stayed with kids","Information in the listing was accurate, we enjoyed our stay. Electricity took out their router and we didn’t have WiFi for a couple of days but Jordan was able to get a tech out there and replace it. It wasn’t too much of a deal since we spent most of our time outside. Jordan was decently fast to respond and was respectful of our time and privacy. We loved the bedroom upstairs and the bed was comfy. We had never been to the gulf coast in MS and were a little disappointed with the beach (we’ve been used to beaches in Florida so it’s hard to compare.) the beaches in Gulfport just don’t feel or look all that clean. That is obviously not at the fault of the owners. The area felt kind of deserted (mid-July) with not a lot of people in the area. We didn’t really find a lot of places where we enjoyed the food. Please don’t let what I said prevent you from booking if you just need something private. it truly is a nice location and wonderful to wake up to in the morning. We drove to Dolphine Island, AL for a day which was only 1.5 hours away. The owners provided a nice gift of snacks and wine. If you do go, you just check out the Pop Brothers for dessert. We met the owner and it was fantastic, we went multiple times during our stay."

The hosts had great communication, the check in was easy, and they even left us a nice welcome package on our first day. We loved everything about this house and would definitely stay here again.
I'll also say that the house is right on a major road across from the beach, so the traffic could get a bit loud during busy times. It was definitely manageable, however, and worth it given the proximity to the beach."

Like so many others we had to change plans for our daughters wedding due to Covid. Our now son-in law was not able to travel due to military restrictions. So Instead of a big wedding in Virginia, we had a very small (6 guests) celebration here. It was amazing. The Nest was the perfect intimate spot! Instead of a fancy rehearsal dinner we enjoyed a fire in the beach. The spacious master bedroom and bath was spa like for the bride to get ready. The views of the beach in the background were perfect for the ceremony!! The photos of the sun setting could not have been more beautiful!
Thank you Krista & Jordan! You helped us transform a disappointing and stressful time to joy and happiness!"

I only have one con and I would recommend that if you are a light sleeper that you bring ear plugs. This house is literally on route 90 and the route is a highly traveled route 24/7. There are a lot of very loud trucks and vehicles day and night! Especially on Friday and Saturday nights. I think the youth in the area use it for drag racing because we were awaken several times with loud roaring motors at high rate of speed late at night.
I feel the house itself it worth tolerating this one annoyance."

Stayed a few nights","It's a beautiful place! The location is perfect; far enough away where you'll have the beach to yourselves but close enough to have some restaurant choices. It's just a mile from Walmart and there's some nice patios just a couple minute drive to Gulfport.
The view is incredible! We enjoyed sitting on the deck and just watching the Gulf. Add in a couple beach bikes, chairs, and BBQ, and we had everything we needed.
Communication with the hosts was great as well. They immediately answered all our questions and had some great recommendations. They had a little welcome message for us as well as some thoughtful snacks.
We highly recommend The Nest. If you're headed to the beach, stay here. It's a great setup and wonderful hosts."

Stayed with kids","We had a WONDERFUL time and the views could not be beat. The house is right off a main road so it was easy to get to different places to pick up food or go out to eat. Even with COVID, everywhere was open and we were able to eat some delicious southern food. They welcomed us with a goodie basket which was a super sweet touch. It rained half the time we were there, but it still was an exceptional stay because the house was so great and the views were wonderful. The elevator is extremely handy when packing in and packing out. We walked over to the beach every single day with our 6 month old and 1.5 year old. The sand is SO powder soft and despite the water not being crystal clear, it was still really clean and nice to play in! It was also really shallow so my daughter could play safely. The upstairs view from the bedroom was so dreamy and the shower pressure was EXCELLENT! Book this unique and beautiful stay and you won't regret it!"

We loved this house! Well-appointed kitchen so we cooked a lot, but there are great restaurants everywhere. We tried Darwell’s and LOVED it. We used Krista and Jordan’s bikes to ride down through Pass Christian and all the gorgeous seaside homes. Just a really great location. One last thing, we had never tried a bed jet before and it was so life-changing. We ordered one immediately! Worth the price of admission. This place is great. Book now and have zero worries."

It is extremely comfortable and allows for an extra guest or two to have plenty of personal space. The location was great- -we loved being further away from the busy traffic zones toward Biloxi which also made it easier to cross over to the beach. Whether traveling to Ocean Springs or taking a drive to Long Beach, Pass Christian, or Bay St. Louis, the house is located centrally to all. The green space next to the house (along with the cool breezes) made it so relaxing just to hang out. We cooked most of our meals at the house and can say that the kitchen is very well stocked with supplies. The owners have thought of everything-even bikes to ride! You will not be disappointed!"

The home is beautifully decorated and had every comfort we could ask for. This place would be perfect for a weekend get-away or for a month-long retreat. We stayed for a week and I was able to dial into every meeting and never had the internet drop.
The natural beauty: The beach has soft, white sand. We watched pelicans and other sea bird diving into the ocean. We watched fish jumping out of water during the day. At night, we watched schools of smaller fish jump in response to a flashlight. We saw an armadillo walking down the street. Also, there are the most amazing sprawling old trees on and near the property.
The hosts: Jeremy and Katrina were very prompt and polite in every communication. I would definitely rent from them again."

Lisa's place was perfect. This was our first trip to Gulfport and we were delighted with the beautiful white sand beach. We enjoyed driving down Beach Blvd and being able to see the water on one side and the beautiful homes on the other side. The Roku had to be replaced when we were there which Lisa and Rachel took care of quickly. Rachel left us some homemade chocolate chip cookies when she replaced it. Yummy 😋 They went above and beyond to take care of us. We will be back. Oh, the sidewalks were perfect for me to walk with our dog in the neighborhood and by the beach."

The space is so comfortable! I was very impressed with how clean everything was. The basket of snacks was a very nice touch. The bed was very comfy! Lisa was very helpful, kind, and communicated great! This was a short trip, but we definitely plan to return soon for a longer stay and take advantage of the beach being across street!"

Stayed a few nights","Sea La Vie is a very clean, private, well-furnished, well air-conditioned dwelling with super-easy parking. It’s one block away from the Mississippi Sound which has beautiful sand and warm, calm water. The sound is so shallow, in fact, that the fist 200 yards from shore are like a kiddy pool- no exaggeration! You have to sit down to get your belly wet. Though I loved the sun, sand, and water, there isn’t much of a beach culture- probably due to the lack of surf. Moreover, restaurants are a bit spread apart, and the wooden piers remain closed from storm-damage. However, the approachability of the beach (lots of free parking) is second to none, and the paved beachside trail made jogging very desirable. It’s a 1.5 mile jog to downtown Gulfport and the brand new Mississippi Aquarium."

She helped us find a place for dinner, Half Shell Oyster House, which was about 5 minutes down the road. We slept so comfortably! She even has a box fan for guests, which is so awesome for those of us who use one every night! The beach is less than a 5 minute walk. Everything was just as described and just lovely!

I brought my 8-year-old golden retriever with me, who absolutely loved lying in the yard and running on the beach. We took walks along the path each day. There are some restaurants nearby - you could certainly walk to them. I chose to drive just because I was by myself and it was super hot outside. There is a small grocery store just down the road, the Gulf Islands Waterpark, and the Aquarium - all within 2 miles. Parking was easy and safe. And the neighborhood was absolutely lovely, quiet, and safe too! Whenever I need a few days away from New Orleans, I will certainly check to see if Lisa's is available!"

A fair number of steps to reach the interior of this home which is two levels. Parking and storage is under this home. Parking was very tight for my 4-door dual rear wheel truck but standard autos/SUVs should be no problem.
I requested to extend my stay by one day which was promptly acknowledged and approved by the hosts.
I was very satisfied with my stay and will consider this home if back in Gulfport again.

Stayed a few nights","Shawn & Cindy's Seaside Sanctuary was exactly what we were looking for (i.e., private, beach view, very clean (seemed brand new), reasonable cost, and everything was easy (e.g., communication, access, recommendations, etc.). We won at the casino, the meals / restaurants we're very good, everyone we met (e.g., liquor store guy, post office lady, wait staff, etc.) were super friendly. The place is built on stilts... so be prepared to go up & down stairs with luggage, groceries, etc. Also, having eye-covers to sleep in darkness was helpful.
Totally unrelated to Shawn & Cindy and Seaside Sanctuary... we felt we were targets of a pickpocket scheme by a woman-man team at the Island View Casino blackjack table (i.e., zip up & secure your purse & be wary of overly friendly / advice giving person [i.e., the woman] with her partner [i.e., the guy] lurking in wait at a nearby slot machine).
The accommodations were perfect & we had a wonderful time! R&G"

Stayed a few nights","The Mississippi Gulf Coast from Pass Christian to Biloxi is a treasure of pristine beaches, great seafood restaurants, interesting shops, picturesque harbors, casinos (mainly in Biloxi) and even a historic site (Beauvoir--Jefferson Davis' last home). We stayed in a home located in this area with all the coast has to offer. Not many homes or hotels (except for the huge casinos) on the coast are right on the water, but we stayed as close as possible.
Like many buildings near the waterline, the building is up high on stilts to avoid hurricane storm surges. We parked in the open-air garage beneath the house. Once up the 20 or so stairs, we entered a comfortable apartment with kitchen and laundry. On the patio, traffic from Beach Boulevard could be noisy, but the fine views more than made up for it.
The home looks freshly built and is well accessorized for a comfortable stay
When not looking off the patio, we could watch the large screen TV with access to a number of streaming services!"

Stayed with kids",Everything was great…just as portrayed in the pictures and described in amenities. Shawn and Cindy were very responsive to any messages sent and also checked in during our stay from time to time to make sure everything was going well. Our stay was just Friday-Sunday and on Friday the noise from traffic made it a bit difficult to enjoy the fabulous balconies but Saturday and Sunday calmed down quite a bit. And the traffic noise was not noticeable at all inside. There are quite a few stairs both inside and outside the home…quite the workout. My granddaughter called it our beach tower. The stairs would definitely not deter me from staying at Seaside Sanctuary again…overall great experience…10 stars!!!

Stayed with kids",There were a couple of things that were inoperable but overall stay was fine. My wife and I are disabled veterans so it was a little difficult to go up and down the numerous stairs. This is definitely a house not meant for anyone who has difficulty with stairs. This is not a fault of the house but something I feel needs to be said. The wagon to take to the beach was “clutch”!! We happened to be in town during “Cruisin’ the Coast” and the loud vehicles going up and down 90 was also a noise issue and sleep didn’t come easy. Ear plugs might be needed for light sleepers. Once again if these are not issues for you then your stay will be completely outstanding because the house was top notch!!

Stayed a few nights","The home was stunning and serene. With 3 outdoor areas to enjoy, we got to enjoy beach views from nearly every room. Check in was easy, hosts were responsive and had clear instructions. Beach access was a short 2 minute walk across the road. Outdoor shower was great for washing off sand. The hosts provided lots of beach amenities like chairs, a beach wagon, and sand toys. Linens were clean inside the home, there were plenty of towels, and beds were SO comfy. Kitchen was well stocked with dishes and was clean and inviting.
We had a lovely stay. If you want beautiful views and lots of fresh air with the beach only steps away, this is the place for you!
The ONLY thing I would change about the home is the placement right beside a busy highway. There was a fair bit of highway noise, but it didn’t take away from our otherwise perfect experience.
The hosts provided restaurant recommendations and, from the suggested list, we ended up having dinner at The Rackhouse and loved it.
10/10!"

Beds were super soft, kitchen completely stocked with everything that you need to cook dinners, have coffee on the porches, etc. we stayed 5 nights, so picked up a few groceries and they had all the cooking utensils to make meals to enjoy while looking out at the ocean. Having a washer and dryer was awesome so we didn't have to take home a ton of dirty laundry! Loved how bright and cheery and tastefully decorated it was also. Everything in the home is peaceful and relaxing. Close to just about everything you would need. Literlly 1/2 a mile from casinos and walmart. Would definitely recommend."

Also, while the house was worth the rental fee - I did notice just a few issues with the home - that no doubt would have been hurricane damage sort of issues. These were NOT a deterrent. Just things that do occur with any home in that area. The linens, the kitchen - everything was well inventoried and clean. I would absolutely recommend Mindy and this home if looking in the area."

I liked that everything needed was included in the house, shower soaps, dishwasher, laundry soap, beach toys and chairs, and even sunscreen. The house was nothing fancy but cheaper than anything similar and it served our family of 4 perfectly. It wasn't right on the beach but it's a very short walk across 1 road, worth the effort because there were no other people on that part so it was much cleaner than parts closer to Gulfport. I definitely would recommend for a relaxing- based for vacation or if you want to be a little distance away from the hustle and bustle of the cities."

Stayed with kids","Perfect for our family of 6. Location was in the middle of everything but also peaceful. They were building another house next door but the only reason we knew is because we saw it. We didn’t even notice noise, even with a kid young enough that still needs his naps! Appreciated the fact that their were full sized shampoo, conditioner, body wash in both bathrooms. PLENTY of towels! Between showering to get sand off 4 kiddos and 2 adults, we never had an issue with towels. Plenty of beach towels too. Kitchen was very clean and appreciated how clean the fridge was and clutter free completely empty. The welcome note was a very nice tough too!"

Restaurants were within a few minutes drive and Walmart was close by. The house was very clean and had plenty of room for my family of 5. We had enough toiletries and kitchen supplies to last for our two day stay.
We enjoyed building sand castles and throwing a frisbee on the beach. As usual in the gulf be aware of the jelly fish. We all got stung at least once."

Group trip",My grandkids were visiting from South Carolina and absolutely loved the house and its location! They stayed for the week of Christmas and it had a Christmas tree and some other decorations in it which were so nice. The home was very clean and well stocked. The kids already requested to stay here next time they come back! Best Airbnb 've ever rented. Thank you Brian and Mindy

Laundry soap, dish detergent, toilet paper, cooking basics & beach towels... just to name a few. It was a short walk or quick drive to the beautiful beaches. We ended up needing to add a day to our stay & they were incredibly accommodating to let us. Great stay!"

We're so glad things turned out the way they did! Mindy's home is clean, comfortable, spacious, and in a safe area. We enjoyed the beautiful Gulf sunsets from the back porch and being so close to the beach. Our favorite beach area, with plenty of room for the kids to run and play, was within a 5 minute drive. Check in and check out were a breeze, the beds were comfy, and there are plenty of good eats near by. We would definitely stay here again!"

Group trip","Beautiful house just across the road from the beach! My family loved the fact that you could walk out the back door and be at the beach. They even had beach chairs for us to use! My wife loved how the house was decorated and that they had just about everything you would need already on hand if you forgot something. When the weather wasn’t cooperating, the leather sectional allowed all 7 of us to sit and watch a movie in comfort. Having a washer and dryer provided on site was really great for dealing with the wet towels and swimsuits. It was easy walking distance to the pier and the casino too! The covered back deck was great place to relax. We would often have a beverage and watch and listen to the ocean after getting too much sun. We loved the fact that it was near all of the action, but just far enough away that we had our own space too. We pretty well had the whole beach to ourselves except for the joggers coming by. We will definitely be back."

House was clean, close to everything!
I was a little disappointed of the beaches in gulfport. And made the drive to clear water beaches vers the beaches in gulfport. HIGHLY recommend this home would stay here again. My children loved the ocean marine park and the dolphin encounter within 15 minutes

Stayed one night","This is a corporate rental-- not a mom & pop-- so that comes with pros and cons.
Pros:
-It's super clean, well appointed, and uncluttered. It also has great family amenities like a pack n play.
Cons:
-They're not flexible or communicative. We paid $85 cleaning fee for just one night, so when baby napped early, I asked if we could check out an hour later thinking for that money their cleaning person might be flexible. They immediately said no (presumably without taking time to ask the cleaning person). So I had to wake baby up to get going on their schedule. Then when I realized I forgot something I had to go back to the house--- only to realize the cleaning person hadn't arrived and they had us leave for no reason."

Stayed with kids","The cottage is very cute and located in a quiet cul-de-sac. It is super close to all of the attractions Gulfport has to offer. I would like to add that it is not very child friendly though. There were many breakables we had to move to ensure they did not get broken. The kitchen table also had very sharp corners with a glass top that is toddler height. There is also no latching mechanism for the front door that is either childproof or above child height. The beach is across the street, but it is a very busy street. You cannot drive straight across, but you can drive and park further down."

The train does run fairly close to the house, so you can hear it’s horn. If you’re a light sleeper or can’t have any noise to go to sleep then the train may bother you, but it certainly did not bother us. It’s positioned nicely between anything you want to do, so it felt like a great launch point! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"

They really thought of everything - beach towels, a beach umbrella, beach wagon, beach chairs, extra linens, every kitchen utensil you could need, a welcome bucket with snacks, and a stock of extra toiletries in case you forgot yours. Plus Rebecca provided a Pack n Play and a high chair for our 18 month old (so nice not to have to pack those)! The beach is about a 10 minute walk away (or a 3 minute drive - parking right by the beach was easy when we were there in late May). The house is immaculately clean and the area felt very safe. There are plenty of restaurants (plus drug stores and grocery stores) nearby - you couldn't really walk to them, but parking is ample around here. We had a great time here and would highly recommend it to anyone!"

When you walk in, the home welcomes you and is fantastically decorated; I loved her beach theme and use of colors and textures. We traveled as a family- a couple and 2 giant teenagers and we had all the space we needed. Perfectly setup, I loved her thoughtful touches like the welcome binder, the coffee and the snacks. I took note of the makeup remover towels and the pods for the wash machine. I thought that was a clever and handy touch I’ve never seen in other vacation rentals. We absolutely would recommend and would stay again when in the area!"

Stayed with kids","This cottage is the cutest! We went over Thanksgiving weekend - arrived on Thanksgiving and Rebecca worked with us to allow us to check in early so we could cook our Thanksgiving dinner!
The house is exceptionally clean and the most well stocked Air BnB I have ever stayed in. Usually we have to provide extra garbage bags, laundry soap, or TP - not here. Rebecca had plenty for the stay. The kitchen is also extremely well stocked. I had brought a peeler and a can opener thinking those items wouldn’t be there, but they were! Has every item you would need to cook any dinner.
The decor is so sweet as well. We loved all the “seas the day” items. Three bedrooms accommodated our family perfectly! The location is perfect too. We walked to the beach one day, it’s only about a 2 block walk. Ocean Springs is only about 20 minutes away and a super cute downtown to check out.
Would most certainly recommend this place to anyone and will stay again if we travel to Gulfport.
Absolutely an amazing little house."

There were 6 of us and we were comfortable and felt like we had plenty of room. The house was just big enough. We didn't use the kitchen area much- we were too busy trying the local restaurants- but there is a kitchen that is perfect for cooking! The beach is a short 7 minute walk from the house. It was beautiful. We were so busy we didn't get to enjoy the back patio, but there was a gorgeous back patio that would be perfect for relaxing.
We ran into an issue with the interenet while we were there, even though it was out of Rebecca's control, she was still quick to reply and try to help us fix our problem.
I will not hesitate to check out Rebecca's place when I return to Gulfport!"
