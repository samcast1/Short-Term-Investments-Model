Stayed a few nights","We stayed for a softball tournament. We had six guys. Williams place is set up more for couples, but it worked. Another bedroom in the spare room or basement would be nice, especially a bunk bed. I understand that the maximum occupancy is six, but it might not always be couples.
Other than that, no complaints. Very nice house, lots of space, and a beautiful yard in a nice part of town located near downtown."

Stayed one night","This was a last minute booking for me and even though the listing said she could respond within 24 hours, She actually responded immediately and kept me informed every step of the way about the process. I was able to get into the house really easily even though it took me a little bit to find a place. Was dark but I was able to get rid in go straight to my room and find the bathroom and everything was available for me. I was only there to spend the night and get some sleep but I look forward to possibly coming back and taking advantage of the area during the daylight. There is great water pressure in the shower and the bathroom is spacious and well ventilated. Is towels are soft and abundant, There were several in my room in the top door of the dresser and I felt like I was able to have as many as I needed. It was a little cold in the room but there was an extra blanket nearby so I slept well in the comfortable bed."

Stayed one night","The house is probably 100 years old with big cast iron radiators. It is very nicely maintained and decorated just like you would expect at a top notch b&b. And very clean! The bed, furnishings, and lights were very comfortable. The bedroom door slides on rollers, like a barn door. Cute but maybe not suitable if you are concerned about privacy. Easy street parking. Overall I would definitely stay there again."

All of that was true to expectation and the bonus was the hospitality. Vicki and her household, including the four-legged furry ones, were welcoming, not overbearing and especially friendly. It was a perfect space for my needs and I would certainly return. Oh, and this was in one of the coldest weeks of the year--the house was warm in both temperature and heart!"

She has a cute little orange kitty that will gladly greet you in your room and snuggle with you if you let her. The mini fridge with a pitcher of water in it was a nice touch. The only downside was I had a hard time finding it at night but her neighbor has a black van parked near the driveway so I used that as a reference point. All in all, a nice comfortable stay. 10/10. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","Vicki was very pleasant and easy to work with. Although I came later in the evening and left early the next morning, I liked that the bedroom was close to the entrance so I did not have to disturb her. The bed was comfortable and the room was sufficient. I would suggest installing a better type of door to the bedroom for added privacy and the rug in the dining area was a trip hazard. I seemed to trip on the edge every time I went to the bathroom. Although, it could be the evenness of the floors that attributed to my clutziness too?? I appreciate her allowing me to stay in her home."

Stayed one night","Vicki's place worked very well for us. She is very welcoming, easy to communicate with and the house is walking distance from nearly everything we did. The cats are adorable but be warned, the accordian door does not keep them out if they want in. We found that just petting them briefly satisfies them and then they're quiet or leave. As other people have noted, the accordian door does not admit much privacy but the room as at the front of the house away from other living and sleeping areas so it didn't bother us too much. The mattress has seen better days but the room was more spacious than expected and the temperature was perfect, even though it was chilly outside."

Stayed one night","Firstly, Vicki is awesome and very welcoming!!! If you're looking for a place to crash for a night or two, this could work well. However, whether we overlooked it in the preview or not, I'm not sure, but our room did not have a regular door. In place of a door was a foldable, sliding plastic thing. I don't know, I guess we just feel that a room should have a regular working door for privacy. Otherwise, Vicki is very sweet and the location is walking distance from downtown. She has another room in the house (or 2), but I cannot speak to those."

Stayed one night","We had a nice stay at this location. The hostess is wonderful, very respectful but welcoming and knowledgeable. There is NO air conditioning in this home. It is noted in the description but I glossed over it, not considering that we would be visiting during a heatwave. It's a lovely 150 year old house, but since we happened to visit on the hottest day of the year, it was uncomfortably hot and stuffy. Vicki provided an additional industrial size fan and a thoughtful pitcher of ice water which helped us sleep. The bed is very soft and high. The bathroom is a little far from the room but clean and well appointed. She made us a pot of coffee in the morning which was a great touch. The door to the room is a very thin accordion door which is a bit difficult to open and close and it provides very little privacy and no security. We had a nice stay despite the heat, but if future travelers have back problems, are unable to climb into a high bed or are significantly affected by the heat try to visit a cooler season."

There is no A/C, luckily the temps had dropped the day we arrived so it was bearable for sleeping."

Vicki's place was perfectly situated for all of our plans. Very close to downtown and the Barn Bluff Trailhead (within walking distance). Only a short drive to the casino. After all the excitement, we had a clean and quiet room to come back to. The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. Vicki also let us use her kitchen to prepare a quick dinner before the show, which was super convenient and time-saving for us. Communication with Vicki was great - she checked in with us a few days before our arrival and it was easy to get a hold of her when we needed to. We would like to revisit Red Wing and would definitely stay at Vicki's again."

We arrived late in the evening because of an accident with a deer, and she stayed up, in spite of an early morning commitment, and helped us carry in items we would have left in the car except that it had to be towed. The room is bigger than we expected. The bed is comfortable. The door to the room is an accordion fold door, which felt a little disconcerting the first night and made it a challenge to keep the kitties out, but by our second night we felt perfectly safe and the kitties were no longer interested in us. The bathroom is on the opposite side of the house, but is large and very clean."

Group trip","We stayed here the weekend of our wedding and it was so amazing. Me and the bridesmaids got ready here and we loved the space so much. I cant say enough good things about the views and the outdoor space.
On the other side, i did not enjoy working with the management company. The check in process is complex, with a portal. When i asked a question about amenities i got a response back saying “ as per the house notes”, and there are many conflicting informations points ie. “no weddings or parties”, yet later it says “weddings and micro events” are acceptable. We wanted to host our rehearsal dinner here but the rules were too strict. The house says it can only sleep 6 (when it can clearly easily hold 8) and even getting that to be okay was a challenge. I asked for an early check in, the kept telling me to check back in 24 hours to see. When i did, there was not a quick reply. They finally told me 2 hours before check in that i can have an early check in. Would stay again, despite this."

Minnestay added a level of bureaucracy that added to the Air BNB booking process and likely added additional to the expense. We had to sign contract from Minnestay and submit a picture of myself holding my ID. We will not book a Minnestay property in the future. The additional cost of the property management company added unnecessary cost with no additional value to us."

Group trip","Beautiful home and yard with lake view. This was air bnb thru Minnestay and expected all conversations to be thru them. We weren’t there even 15 minutes when a lady came by stating she is the owner and wanted to check us out. She came in and it was very intrusive and awkward. We had a 2 night day planned however, on the first morning at 8:15 am a man was there mowing the lawn right outside the windows and even came onto the screen porch which was connected to the master bedroom with glass doors-thus the person getting dressed was visible. Double awkward and scary. We phoned the “we are always here for you” number at minnestay with no answer or reply. With all this we decided we were not getting the rest, privacy or value for money paid, and checked out one day early. We emailed minnestay and they said the owner arranges the lawn service and there is no way that they can control it, and other lip service answers."

Access to my room was through a private back entrance and I even had the bathroom to myself. I rarely saw Rick and Shelly but when I did they were friendly. Whenever I needed something, I just messaged them and they took care of it right away. The descriptions said there is a friendly cat who may come say hello, but I never saw it. Their garden and seating areas outside are very pretty. The house is within quick walking distance of restaurants, shops, bars, groceries, and the Mississippi River. Hiking trails are close by. I would stay here again if I go back to Red Wing."

Fumbled around finding lights and power strips. Bed good. Sink in room was smart since bathroom was down hallway. In room coffee maker and mini fridge good. Lots of TV channels. Quiet room. Given local hotel rooms are outrageous at 300 a night this worked for me. Steep steps so be wary if you can’t do steps. I walked downtown for breakfast and farmers market.

Stayed a few nights","We had I high hope for this stay because of the positive reviews. But I been told that a host can have all positive reviews if they m do not post reviews of guest who have contacted them about concerns/ issues.
So most likely this post will never be posted.
Upon entering the home I could smell a old house musky smell. As went up the stairs the smell was replaced with strong air freshener smell. First thing I did was going into the restroom across the hall from our room. I was then sprayed with an automatic room freshener. I had a Immediate bad reaction with my face getting flushed was having a hard time breathing. My reaction was to get in the shower, but all I could find was dirty towels. I messaged the host. And she came came up the stairs and yelled at me for using her private restroom. I told her I did not feel I could stay there because of my reaction to her air fresheners, she denied their was an issue. She said no one had ever had an issue before. When I asked her to look at my face she said. ‘I don’t care you are costing a lot of money if I had to refund’. She said if we did not like it we could leave. I told her I would Expect a full refund. She said she would after we left.
All was a very scary situation. We had no choice but to leave.
When we contacted host she stated she was contacting Airbnb for refund and then again stated complaining me using her restroom. Apparently our restroom was down the hall not the open door across from our room. A very terrible experience, which l left us with trying to find a room in order to participate in our family event. At this point no refund. The town was completely booked or the weekend. If the host would have funded it could of been rebooked, since our stay started on a Thursday and we were not there longer then 20 minutes."

Stayed a few nights","All in all, a great value and pleasant experience. I would recommend this site for a pleasant stay in Red Wing. The home's location is an easy walking distance to downtown.
The accommodations in Room #2 were perfect for our weekend in Red Wing for a wedding and hiking. Everything matches the photos and descriptions. No detail is overlooked. Check-in was easy. The bed was very comfortable. Room #2 uses the private bath a short way down the hall, no issues given one is the only guest in residence. (Pack a robe for your convenience.) There is a sink in the room with it's own light which is useful as a vanity mirror, teeth brushing, etc. The refrigerator and microwave are in the large closet; so convenient but not in the way nor spoiling the charm of the Victorian décor.
We were out and about most of the time. If you are a traveler spending more time in the room consider booking Room #4 which provides more space, such as comfy chairs for leisurely reading a book in the evening or a table for playing a game of cards with friends. The outdoor sitting areas are set in lovely gardens.
The hosts, Shelly and Rick, were prompt and friendly in all communications."

Stayed a few nights","I spent my first 40 years in Red Wing and was taking a mini-vacation to visit friends and family. I was happy to find a spot walking distance to downtown. Shelly apologized, as the roofers she was expecting the week before had notified her that they'd be there the morning after I arrived. I had a packed schedule, so was rarely there when the roofers were, and when I was there when they were, it really wasn't that bad. I slept well in room 2, and having a sink right there was nice. I had some nice chats with Shelly and Rick, and gave belly rubs to the cat just before I left. I will definitely be staying here again."

It was a cozy room where we could come back from our adventures in town and relax and enjoy watching movies. I regret not coming in the summer when the flowers would have been in full bloom. I could see the potential this spring. Another enjoyable anniversary getaway in Red Wing!"

Our coffee maker decided that first morning it didn't want to work, when we got back that afternoon it had already been replaced. Adorable dogs, and a cat, but they stay in their part of the house. Nice places to sit out in the lovely yard. Can't think of a thing that would be less than stellar and we plan to go back again"

In addition, the neighborhood is peaceful and within easy distance of downtown and a variety of restaurants and shops. We felt like we had been transported back in time to a place and period of elegance.
Jordan was a thoughtful and gracious host.
Finally, something that's important to me, checkout was easy and painless; the cleaning fee seems to cover the ""do this, do that"" list that other hosts sometimes make a guest perform. Bravo Jordan!

It is easy to get to and centrally located with a short walk to downtown Red Wing and all of the great cafes, restaurants, shops, and taverns.
Jordan is a fantastic host. She is very responsive to questions and communicated quickly. Wish we could give her and her home more than the maximum five stars allowed. If the opportunity arises to return to the area, we will definitely stay there again."

We played games, ate, laughed and enjoyed being together. We felt right at home there. The rooms were spacious, everything was clean, the house was inviting inside and out. Thank you!"

Group trip",We had a fabulous girls weekend at Jordan's airbnb. The home was perfect for our group of 5. The house was extremely clean and updated. We loved having the 2 bathrooms and the beautifully decorated bedrooms. We all appreciated the decorations and thoughtful touches. The kitchen had everything we needed for making snacks and loved the coffee bar in the mornings. We were greeted with wine and treats and a kind thank you note when we arrived which was so kind. We loved having the deck and living area for gathering space and utilized the fun games for entertainment. We were close to downtown and could easily walk to the shops and restaurants. We had the best time and will definitely recommend Jordan's airbnb to anyone traveling to Red Wing. Thank you for an amazing stay!

Stayed a few nights","The craftsman style home was friendly and spacious. Everything was modernized, bathrooms, central air and heating, but still had craftsman detail, stained glass, wooden decorative banisters, oak trim, porch swing.
Most important were the hosts, Jordan and Luke. They were extra special. When they restored the house, Luke proposed in the back bedroom during a late night painting session.
We felt we were part of history, the younger generation saving restorable pieces of the past so the generation that grew up in these houses through the 1930's and 40's
could see that the next generation was hard working and caring.
They responded immediately to our every request. We decided to come back again to the exact same place, 2 weeks later."

The beds (and sofa) were very comfortable for sleeping/resting. A nice variety of books and information on Red Wind was available, which was really nice. It's a very easy walk to downtown, which we did often. We saw a show at The Sheldon, had brunch at The St. James, looked at houses and shopped a little. We took lots of trips out but always looked forward to ""coming home""."

Very comfortable stay, nice furniture, quality linens, varied pillow firmness to meet personal preferences. Family ranging from 4 years to 60 years all slept comfortably. Well stocked amenities. Spacious place with lots of country character. Great place to unplug, though still be connected if needed.
Hosts were incredibly kind going the extra mile, letting us extend our time since there weren’t guests staying immediately after us. We didn’t want to rush saying goodbye to our local relatives, and Leonardo was so generous to give us that extra time before we checked out. Easy check out process. Good parking. Perfect location.

It was clean and well-equipped with all the necessary appliances and amenities that we needed to make our stay enjoyable. With a lot of common areas, our group of 3 couples were able to all sit together in each area or split into men & women groups for conversation and games.
The only thing that we didn't care for was the lack of outside lighting when we arrived during the early evening in fall. Our phone lights led our way, but a security light on the outside if the home would have been appreciated. The home is located a few short blocks from the downtown shopping district. We could have easily walked but the temps were too cold for our liking. If ever in the Red Wing area for another group outing, we would definitely stay here."

It was clean and well stocked with everything we needed.
The area is quiet with no traffic.
My favorite part of Airbnb accommodations is being immersed in the local community and this location did not disappoint.
The location is perfect for exploring the downtown area of Red Wing; restaurants, boutiques and local knick knack and artisan shops aplenty!
We loved that although updated, the home retains the charm and character of an older home.
Thank you for such a great experience!"

We were very impressed with the homes character and charm as well as the quality of furnishings from the moment we entered the door. Leonardo’s home was an excellent home base for our weekend away to celebrate our Son’s Wedding at a nearby wedding venue. Worked out great for a grill out and some games of bags on our second night as the large, level concrete parking area was perfect for that. The beds were very comfy! Home floor plan was very nice and useful for both meal prep and quiet sitting rooms. Enjoyed our coffee in the mornings in the lovely sunroom. Photos of the home paint a very accurate picture. Close to main downtown area for walkability to shops and all Redwing offers if desired. I am so happy we found this home for our memorable weekend and will certainly be staying there again if any opportunity to be back in area arises. Thanks also to Leonardo for providing great communication and even accommodating our request for an early checkin. Well done!!!"

I loved how the place was decorated with both modern and personal touches. Jon was a GREAT communicator and responded quickly to any questions we had. He was also extremely accommodating when it came to booking his place. I would 100% recommend this place and wish we spent more time there.

A tip for light sleepers -- the home is the first house off of the main road through town and since it's an older home, not much noise insulation. I suggest sleeping with a sound machine or fan.
Jon's place definitely did the trick for 2 nights in town."

The check in and check out processes were easy and manageable. Rachel also left lots of helpful notes with instructions on how to use different appliances such as the TV and fireplace.
There were guides to all the local attractions left on the kitchen table that we found super helpful for planning out our stay!

The accommodation on the top floor is spacious and charming, with comfortable and attractive furnishings as well as intriguing nooks and objects to explore and admire. We were 2 unrelated travelers, and I chose (excitedly) to sleep in the upper alcove, leaving the main bed for my traveling companion. Climbing the sturdy ladder each night made me feel like a child again. The amenities were generous and of good quality -- exactly as described. Communication with Rick was efficient and pleasant. There are flights of stairs to climb (shoes off, please to spare the floors!) and that ladder to the alcove. The description is honest in describing the access. Downtown Red Wing and the mighty river are a quick stroll away. Wonderful value (a bargain!) -- I'll definitely return."

We loved having a small frig and microwave along with some dishes to use for our breakfast in the morning, and hors d’oeuvres in the evening. The welcome card, chocolate chip cookies, and the complimentary Keurig coffee/tea was a super nice touch!

I'm extremely particular about cleanliness, especially traveling with my 10 month old son, and I had absolutely no complaints here!
Shelly and Rick were great hosts. Gracious accommodating, and available when needed.
The location is great! Fantastic views of the bluffs, close enough to downtown to walk to many shops and restaurants (check out Hanish Bakery, you won't regret it), with a gas station not even half a block away should you need something quickly.
The home and gardens are remarkably beautiful and well kept.
I honestly can't wait to come back myself and stay here again!"

Shelly joined us for a glass of wine one afternoon out on the front porch for great conversation, which was a real treat!

My 21-year old daughter took that space to sleep in as the loft had a queen size air mattress made up with a comforter and pillows.
Shelly was VERY responsive, the yard was whimsical with statues and flowers, and the whole vibe staying here was pretty awesome. Great for a romantic getaway, some time alone to recharge, or a girlfriend weekend."

Downtown was a little slow, some things closed which was a bummer with this incessant shutdown, but Shelly's place was comfortable, spacious, quiet and cozy. A great place to relax! There were lots of books, cute sitting places, decorated prettily but not cluttered. We were also glad for the Keurig, microwave and mini fridge plus real flatware.
There were nice little touches-fresh flowers, a note, some rolls, and chocolates. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and fresh. The house's features were gorgeous-amazing woodwork and so many doors! We really appreciated her availability when figuring out the fireplace-which is one of the main reasons we chose the place-we love a cozy fireplace! Just a lovely experience all around, and we're happy to have found this place:)"

Plus really nice linens. The space was extremely clean and overall a wonderful experience. Close walking distance (a few short blocks) to shops, restaurants, and parks in town.

They were very narrow and the railing could not be gripped all around. Kind of precarious to get down. It was more of a pinch hold which didn't feel safe. The big TV was nice and we used the chest as a table for playing games. A decent place with a few issues. Feel that the price was high for what was given.

Stayed about a week","I grew up in this town, but moved to AL almost 12 years ago. All of my family still lives there. I visit as often as I can and usually stay at the Country Inn & Suites, but this time, I was traveling alone without my husband. I thought it would be fun to try something different, as well as have a place where my sisters, young nieces, and I could relax and just enjoy being together at the end of the day. It was so cozy, and absolutely perfect!! It snowed while I was there! Yes, I'm a 55-year-old child at heart this time of the year. We lost mom in April and dad many years ago, so it's just us girls now. We wanted to get together this season and celebrate each other and remember mom by doing things we used to do. It couldn't have been more perfect! This cozy little apartment was hard to leave and go back home....or maybe that was my sisters and nieces. I will be back in the very near future when my oldest niece has her first baby!! I cannot say thank you enough!"

Stayed a few nights","Neighborhood is delightful, and the apartment perfectly fit my needs. William communicated well.
The apartment is wonderfully quiet, with little to no neighbors’ noise. The air conditioner is nearly silent!!!
Things that didn’t bother me, but that you might want to consider:
The stairs are indeed steep, and shallower than today’s stairs.
The floors are new-on-top of old, so not totally level. If you are prone to weebling, this could be problematic.
For A/C to fill the bedroom, the door will need to be wide open during the night.
The curtains are not blackout, so when the sun rises, the light comes in.
LOL, in boutique import beer news, House of Wine and Spirits carries San Miguel Pale Pilsner. (If you know, you know: YUM!!!)"

Stayed a few nights","This is a super cute space, very quiet and clean. Everything you might need is there—soap, Keurig pods, a pizza pan, oven mitts, plates, cutlery, cups, etc. The check in/entry is very easy. When a sudden intense squall blew through town, William reached out to make sure the place had not lost power and to check if we needed anything."

Stayed one night","Place was great. Very clean, very modern. Obviously it was recently remodeled. Located in a quiet, clean, and pretty neighborhood. Downtown and the river are a short drive/uber away. Nature walks pretty near by. Building is right next store to a great family owned grocery store, which was great. William was very quick and easy to communicate with us and helped us get set up last minute to make our trip happen. Great place to stay for a couple, a good buddy and yourself, or just yourself."

Stayed one night","This a very pleasing apartment, upstairs in what seems to be a 4-plex 40's-ish building in a residential neighborhood, and seemingly recently remodeled and furnished.
It is very pleasant, comfortable, efficient , convenient, and very clean and well maintained. There is electronic and no-physical-interaction with the hosts check in and out.
The furnishing, kitchen equipment, supplies, decorations, etc., are quite sufficient. They seem a little spartan to us, but our previous AirBnB expediencies were pre-COVID, and this is our first post-vaccination trip. We could well believe that the COVID-standard has changed for what can be left around from guest-to-guest, as for example and open box of tissues.
This lodging fulfilled all our needs and we were very happy with it."

Stayed one night","This is a lovely apartment in a quiet part of town. It was easy to find and easy, no contact entrance. Be aware it is a full size bed. We usually go for a queen size. It's a great place to be when exploring Red Wing! Thanks so much!"

Stayed a few nights","William was an excellent host, and the apartment was perfect for a weekend getaway. The space was extremely clean and had everything I needed while I was there. There is a small grocery store around the corner that was useful for picking up supplies. The apartment is in a very quiet area (with a comfortable bed as well) but less than a 5 minute drive to downtown Red Wing. I think the space would work best for a couple or single traveler as it would likely get crowded with more than that (there is an air mattress available as well). I would definitely stay here again."

The location of the space was perfect for me, quick into town with easy access to everything I needed. Recommended for anyone visiting Red Wing. This is a much better option than any of the RW hotels I have stayed at."

Stayed one night","Went to redwing with another couple to get away for a night! This upstairs apartment was newly remodeled and everything was adorable ! The space was utilized great for the small space! May be better for two adults with two small kids but we had a blast! Host was very accommodating! We went to Barn Bluff hiking, a little shopping, and dinner at Scarlet in the St. James hotel. Great night get away!"
