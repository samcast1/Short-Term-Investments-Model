Our only wish was that we could come back in the summer to see all the beautiful gardens in full bloom!
It was a fair price and we will keep it in mind for our next trip to B-Town."

Stayed a few nights","This rental takes me back to the golden days of AirBNB - a unique, interesting, fun property without fuss or hassle. I thought this place was great. It's incredibly private, on a great property, and has a tranquil setting that you can really relax in. I appreciated how the rules of the property both provide, and invite those staying at the oasis to be respectful of the home and natural setting. No enormous list of chores, just a vibe that if you're respectful and decent, there will be no issues. This place is special and I would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","What an absolutely beautiful spot -- this is without a doubt my favorite place to stay in Bloomington now, because of the serenity of the high-walled garden and cozy, well-appointed house, but also because of the proximity to the head of the B-Line Trail. Less than a mile along the trail into downtown, and just a bit further to Switchyard Park or beyond to the gorgeous Clear Creek Trail. Highly recommended, especially if you're able to bring a bike with you! Max is helpful and responsive, but also gives you space to fully appreciate the rare experience of being in such a lush, private, living space. Morning coffee and stretching in the backyard covered patio space was a high point, as was the comfortable mattress!"

The little cottage is incredibly interesting and the secluded setting really makes it an oasis! I brought my mountain bike with me since this place is so close to the north trailhead of the B-line. That made getting about Bloomington and the Indiana University campus tremendously easy and safe! Bloomington is such a great town for cycling! I will definitely try to stay here again when coming back to B-town!

Stayed a few nights","One of our favorite ABNBs ever. The photos don't do justice to how beautiful and secluded the spot is. Everything is well-appointed and thoughtfully laid out. Many personal and caring touches. Max was awesome and accommodating. Well-stocked kitchen.
When booking, we were a little worried about parking (always a concern with our van). We shouldn't have been. Parking is off-street in a spacious driveway, and the neighborhood is quiet and tranquil. We were also a little concerned about heat/managing a wood fire, but, again, no problems at all. The house has central-heating and was always warm even on the unseasonably cold days we were there. Overall, it was a delight staying here. Hope we can visit again sometime."

Stayed a few nights","This place is truly magical and I feel fortunate to have had the chance to stay there. The extensive, sprawling gorgeous gardened lot tucked away in such a surprising location is just awesome. I was there just at start of spring and the bird song was constant and you could see that the gardens would soon be amazing. The unique aesthetic of the house is very charming. I already had a strong affinity for this subsection of Bloomington because I lived for several wonderful years within a 5+ minute walk of this Max's Oasis, but what he has created here is just so awesome and both adds on to and transcends the awesome feeling of the Near West Side and adjacent areas. If the pictures appeal to you, you owe it to yourself to stay in this house."

Pay attention, please, to all the host’s communications about directions, especially if arriving after dark. Inside the gate you will find a nature sanctuary - a fortress of peace. Extravagant raised bed and terraced garden, enjoyable in fall, when we came. Probably just as wonderful in any season. Maybe you will be welcomed by an amiable cat. Take off shoes. Inside, not a speck of dust. Purity embodied. Hardwood floors, molded plaster walls. Beautiful shower, luxurious sleep. A bird’s song will awaken you.. Good karma."

The home was tucked away and allowed for quiet rest after our long tiring day. We awoke to bird song and had our coffee in the beautiful garden. Our only regret was not having enough time to enjoy the space. We vow to return!

If quiet, peaceful, nature, earth, balance, and harmony are on your wish list, then this is the place for you. Read the details of the owners manual before you book; it's all in there. And if you come away from that reading thinking you've found the right spot, you can't even begin to imagine how right you are!
Not only would I want to stay in Max's Oasis again, I'd like an extended stay of a few months. It's that peaceful!
Close enough to downtown to walk if you're a hiker / walker, and about a 3-minute drive if you prefer to drive.
Highly recommend!"

Quiet, peaceful, with beautiful gardens outside (that will be much more so in a few weeks, when spring is in full gear) and birds singing. If you want to be in the life of the town, this isn't the place, but if you want a quiet place of your own, with a very short walk into downtown Bloomington, this place is ideal. Max is incredibly accommodating and helpful, and the place is like a little cabin in the woods - it's in a city, but doesn't feel that way. There's a lot of attention to being earth friendly, which I also appreciated. Altogether, just what I needed for a retreat for a few days."

She was able to accommodate us for both an early check-in AND a late check-out, which is almost never possible. We were apartment hunting, so we spent a lot of time exploring Bloomington but it was great home-base and we loved the time we spent there. The breakfast was absolutely amazing. Overall, one of my best AirBnB experiences and I would definitely stay here again. Also - her walls are COVERED with vinyl's, so if you love music like us, you could spend hours just browsing through the collection and playing them."

Marina provided great instructions and was very timely in her communication. Can’t forget about the complimentary breakfast, which is basically the cherry on top. We would have zero hesitation in staying here again!"

The hosts Marina and Frank were super awesome in that they were friendly, accommodating and super hospitable. The apartment was clean and comfortable in a safe, walkable neighborhood close to the square and many shops and restaurants. A fun perk was they had a record player and shelves of vinyl in which to listen to a variety of music.
The hostess was real kind and offered to feed me on several occasions. The food they offered from their business was delicious! This will be my go-to place when I'm back in B-town."

Stayed a few nights","Marina is a very approachable and friendly person. She does not seem to mind going out of her way to help her guests. The Frenchy breakfasts she provided me during my stay were delicious – such a perk.
The location of this place is a block from the downtown center, and it takes about a 10-minute walk to reach the IU front entrance, perfect for my short legs. The Bloomington Food market is right next door, and there are restaurants, eateries, and shopping within a 5-minute walk. Additionally, there's a Bloomington Public Parking garage just around the corner from the rental with a low cost of 50 cents per hour, available 24/7.
The unit is situated above Le Petit Cafe, with its own entrance on the left-hand side. Once you get inside the gate, a set of stairs leads up to a spacious deck and the entrance to the unit, which can be found directly ahead. I felt safe here and will definitely return when I come to visit my son (who is attending IU) again."

From the beginning Marina was easy to communicate with. Always prompt and detailed with her replies. Check-in was clear and quite flexible on the time.
My family said that the room was good, Marina was very nice, food was excellent, and bed was comfy.
The location is very central to downtown amenities and not far also to walk to the university.
I do hope that I can experience Marina’s hospitality when we visit our daughter in the near future. Thank you for being gracious and understanding with our oldest change of heart to spend more time with her family than the dorm room and for the key.
In summary, highly recommend Marina’s home."

We walked just down the street to the blue bird for a concert and then several bars/restaurants afterward. Nothing was more than a 10 minute walk! Our only complaint would be the parking which is metered or a 5 minute walk for free overnight. The best part was freshly cooked breakfast brought right to our door and very little clean up required of us. Definitely worth it for this great host, perfect location, and wonderful place to sleep.

Breakfast was excellent too, such a treat. The location is great, right by the square. Marina communicated with us throughout the stay to organize arrival, breakfast and departure times. We hope to stay here again on future visits!"

Marina's communication was perfect. She replied fast whenever I need her help, and we could feel that she repects us. Grocery mart is right near the house. Only 30 sec.

She communicated well, answering any questions and she was incredibly accomodating. She included breakfast and had no problem preparing a GF breakfast for me, since I have celiac. The place itself was so cool. Cannot beat the location. I visited my son and was able to walk everywhere. She also provided useful tips for where to park. I'm only sorry we discovered this place the year my son graduates from IU. Wish I would've been staying there all 4 years while he was in college. Highly recommend."

The location is ideal for walking access to downtown shops and restaurants, including Bloomingfoods next door. We were attending events on the university campus and loved that it was just a short drive away. We were very comfortable in the space and Marina really has thought of everything we might have needed for our stay. Though the parking was a little tricky, Marina’s detailed instructions made it easy to manage because I knew what to expect. I will look forward to my next visit to Bloomington and hope to stay at this lovely place again!"

Marina's place is one of my favorite airbnb experiences ever, and if I have even the slightest hint that I will be back in Bloomington, I will look first to book this charming loft well in advance!! Walked in looking for a nice place to stay. Walked away with the feeling that I was leaving a friend. The location is perfect. You can walk to just about anything that downtown has to offer. You're a short drive to campus. Marina will fix breakfast for you. There's a co-op fresh market next door, and a street fair / market just a block away on Saturday (at least there was when I was there!). Absolutely wonderful experience that I cannot recommend highly enough!"

Stayed a few nights","This apartment was so lovely! It's within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and shops, and right next door to the food co-op. It's cozy and comfortable, and we really loved listening to Marina's eclectic collection of LP's (there are easily over 1000 records!). The breakfast was delicious and Marina was delightful! It's a perfect place to stay, whether you want to explore Bloomington or just chill out in the apartment."

I was back in Bloomington with my college friends for the first time in 5 years, and all we wanted to do was stay in the airbnb and listen to records because the place is so cozy! It's walkable to basically everything and Marina's breakfasts are no joke. She does not skimp on the brie! Marina is kind and friendly and ensured we had a wonderful experience. We're already planning on coming back!"

Stayed with kids",What a lovely stay! Unusually quiet spot in the heart Bloomington. I found the lack of kitchen quiet relaxing. Marina herself provides a SPECTACULAR breakfast to your door and not only are there too many amazing restaurants within walking distance to miss cooking there is also a grocery next door with great hours. Same with no television - who needs it with access to such a phenomenal record collection! My daughter and I spent our down time taking turns on the turntable and talking about our favorite songs. This spot couldn’t have been any more perfect. All of what you need and less of what you don’t when you need to relax and escape. Thank you for your Hoosier hospitality direct from France!

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay here. The communication was excellent, even letting us check-in a little bit before we were supposed to. They also left some granola bars, coffee pods & soap/shampoo for the showers, which was great.
As a quick heads up, the second bedroom isn't really a full bedroom - it's more of an alcove with a big curtain separating it from the living room. But it has its own closet, and the curtain is plenty large to feel like it's a separated space. It wasn't a problem for us, but should probably be described a bit more explicitly in the description in case that's an issue for someone else.
We greatly enjoyed our stay though! Would recommend."

Stayed one night","It's a lovely place, in easy walking distance to Bloomington's restaurants to the immediate west of campus. It's on Walnut, which is a busy street by Bloomington standards, but the traffic dies down by the time most people retire for the night. The bedroom abuts a common wall so one has to depend on the adjoining unit's habitants' being quiet, which they eventually were. I'd stay there again."

Bloomington is small enough that there was no place we wanted to go that was more than 10 minutes' drive. Check-in and check-out were both easy and as described.
The host was excellent. We asked if we could have an earlier check-in time to be able to make an engagement. She responded within minutes and cheerfully met our request.
If our travels were to take us to Bloomington again, we would be happy to stay here again."

The bed is very comfortable, the shower is nice, the kitchen is well equipped, the living room is comfortable, and there’s a closet for stashing bags/gear! It was terribly hot when we were there, so we didn’t get to enjoy the porch very much, but it would be really fun on a nice day. As for the sharply angled ceiling that several people have mentioned, we didn’t find it to be any problem once we got used to it. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone staying in the area."

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough good things about this place. It is 100% as it looks in the pictures. It's one of the cleanest Airbnbs I've ever stayed at.
The low ceilings are a bit tricky to get used to...I hit my head once getting into the bed, but it didn't do it again. Lol This does present an issue if someone has physical limitations. The bed is simply laying straight on the floor. I rolled onto the floor, then got up. It didn't bother us, but it could definitely limit others.
The bottles of water that Bree had in the fridge for us when we arrived was such a welcome sight. The freezer door has all the wi-fi info, check-out instructions, etc. Check-in and out was so smooth.
There was facial cleanser, body wash, q-tips, and even dental picks in the bathroom. The shower was plenty big...even had a wooden bench in it. My little nit pick is that the water pressure isn't the best.
The price couldn't be beat for this little hidden gem. I 1000% recommend this place and thank you Bree!"

The modern and clean interior of the house made us feel right at home. Bree, the host, was fantastic to communicate with and respected our privacy, while still being available if we needed anything. The location was ideal as it's just a few minutes away from IU and downtown Bloomington, but being nestled in the a quaint wooded neighborhood gave us a sense of tranquility that we wouldn't have found in town. We're already planning our next visit and can't wait to stay at Bree's place again!"

Stayed a few nights","This review is based on the great price we paid for our stay and the close distance to IU. The house was cute, very cozy, and even though it's an older house, it was clean. The amenities were fantastic - so much more than I've had at previous Airbnb's! The shower was glorious - great pressure and the water felt so soft! The mattresses were good, but bed linens need to be upgraded. Some other little things: towels were nice; AC was nice and cool; spare pillows were easy to find; old house = uneven floors, but we managed. The neighborhood was aesthetically questionable, but we still felt safe. Can't beat the location to IU - just minutes down the road! Very kind and helpful host, would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","You had me at Mister Rogers nightlight! Pictures do not do this place justice! Coolest.Place.Ever. I only wish I had found it sooner. Seriously, this place was on my bucket list and I didn't even know it! Unique, eclectic, nostalgic, just really no words to describe this place. If we didn't have plans for most of our trip, I could've spent hours looking around at all of the neat things and drawing on the walls. Excellent communication and had everything we could possibly need and then some. If you are on the fence about booking this place, don't hesitate for another second or you're missing out. Thank you so much, Ian, for sharing your home with us and I absolutely cannot wait to come back. I'd give it a million stars if I could!"

Stayed a few nights","Another very enjoyable stay at Ian’s. I’d return any time.
I travel a LOT for business and stay at a lot of Airbnbs. Sadly it’s rare these days that one finds a place with a well-stocked kitchen, everything you could possibly need (yup, sugar for one’s coffee seems like a no-brainer but you’d be surprised how many places don’t even provide that!) - and more.
Ian’s sense of fun and interesting design made this place even better.
Great bed, too!
Thanks for a restful, quiet stay."

Ian proactively communicated and was OK with me checking in a bit early. They have a super helpful guide for guests with menus, etc.
The property is exactly as pictured and described. It’s a cozy section of the home’s 2nd floor. There is off street, assigned parking which is a plus in a college town. I loved the he quirky touches throughout the unit. I was happy to leave my mark on the chalkboard and to make a canvas to leave.
All in all, I loved my stay and recommend the location to others who need a place to stay in Bloomington."

Stayed a few nights","It was our 25th wedding anniversary and my wife and I were looking for a unique and special place to celebrate that wasn't too far from home. Ian's Vintage Bones, Modern Heart fit the bill perfectly.
Featuring an intimate balcony deck, the space itself is an infusion of art and functional design. From the layout to the unique artwork and custom furnishings, it's obvious much thought and love went into creating this space. We also loved that the space was fully stocked. It seems that Ian and his wife have thought of just about everything, even little details like a coffee grinder or a fully tricked out medicine cabinet. There were so many cool surprises and personal touches. Though you are in the burbs, it feels secluded. At the same time you are just a couple-o-minutes away from downtown and all the great restaurants, gastro-pubs, and nite life that Bloomington has to offer. In summary, it was an awesome experience. We have already put this destination down in our travel book for the future. We will be back!"

The apartment was exactly as listed, and Ian and Jill had great communication and were warm and welcoming. The kitchen is well equipped, and there are several comfortable spots for sitting in the kitchen and living room and also on the lovely private deck with tall, leafy trees above and around. I appreciated the desk for working. The apartment is beautifully decorated -- just like a home -- with a creative, artistic touch. Comfortable, cozy bed and good bathroom. I would love to return!"

It’s cozy and has everything you could need, plus fun art and books (highly recommend a flip through Crap Taxidermy)! The location was great for biking or walking around Bloomington and the outdoor deck is a nice spot to unwind. Host provided a lot of helpful info and were very nice. Hope to visit again and see how the chalk wall has evolved!"

Stayed one night","I stopped here for the first night of a 10 day road trip with my dog. Check in instructions were spot on and we made it in with no issues (other than my dog deciding that the steps leading up to the deck/entrance were quite scary and I had to make several attempts to get him to join me). Location was close enough to downtown without too many noisy neighbors or much traffic. The people living on the first floor did have children and a dog, so don’t expect complete silence, but nothing too major. The only big difference I noticed from the listing was that the back yard did not have any grass of note, which made letting my dog out to pee a little tricky. The yard is now covered in stone with some dirt surrounding the stone filled center. It ended up raining most of the night so we didn’t get to enjoy the deck or yard as much as I had hoped, but we had a great night regardless! Ian’s home has many eclectic touches that make it incredibly charming and welcoming. Highly recommend!!"

The floor plan is kitchen and small sitting area in the center with two sections on either side - each with a bath and two beds (so 4 beds total - with nice mattresses and bedding). The host was especially helpful and helped me retrieve a forgotten item. Would stay again …

Taylor was our host and he was very responsive when we had some problems with locking up the house. He also went the extra mile and brought us some throwaway cups to use because the dishwasher needed serviced. The house is close to IU so we could zip back-and-forth for all of the Mom’s weekend activities. We were always able to find an Uber when we needed one. We would definitely stay here again.
