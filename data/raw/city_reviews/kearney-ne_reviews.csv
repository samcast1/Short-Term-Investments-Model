Stayed a few nights","This was a great private getaway from all the crowds while on a crane watching trip. The river was just down from the cabin as described and the property was great for a little hiking and exploring. We brought all of our food for cooking at the cabin and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed for food prep.
Towels and linens were clean and sufficient. There was a nice supply of board games for a rainy day, 3 SmartTV's, and a pair of binoculars for checking out any wildlife you may see at a distance. We definitely heard the wild animals in the middle of the night, but it justed added to the ambiance.
Check-in/out instructions were easy to follow.
Dishwasher, washer and dryer, coffee pot [cone filters], toaster were available and functioning
TIP: Arrive with your food, as the property is as described, off the beaten path. I imagine you will have a bit of a drive to the nearest grocery store if you didn't plan ahead. We were prepared for, and loved the seclusion."

Stayed one night","This place is a gem. My girlfriend and I attended a nearby bull sale and it really couldn’t get any closer. This place is quiet, private, and very spacious. The floor plan is super open and there is a ton of room to spread out. It more than accommodated just the 2 of us and could very easily host a multi-family stay. John was easy to work with and the self check-in with the keypad is a breeze. Do plan to bring your own food as there is not much other than condiments and town is a good distance away. You can definitely cook anything you’d want. There are pots, pans, cookie sheets, a crockpot, etc. The included washer dryer is also nice, we were able to run a load with little issue.
Do be wary of wildlife however. We arrived after dark and there were definitely critters hanging out on the front step when we tried to get in. Not a problem, just an observation. You should expect such things when staying in the Sandhills! 10/10, really can’t go wrong here."

Stayed with kids","This riverside home was everything we hoped for...and more! It is pretty secluded (which suited us great!), in a beautiful part of Nebraska, surrounded by hills, trees, fields, and wildflowers. We brought our two little guys (3yrs and 1.5yrs) and they had great fun romping in the yard and playing on the front porch. The river is accessible but not so close to the house as to make it worrisome for little people who can't swim. A nice little clearing by the river, surrounded by towering cottonwoods, holds a zipline, swing, and slack line that make for great fun. The house itself is clean and beautiful (""magical"" and ""refreshing"" were two words that kept popping up in our vocabulary while we were there), with a well-thought-out layout and a crisp decorating style that is chic while being very kid-friendly at the same time. We are already talking about coming back! We highly recommend this place and its hosts. Thanks for a great stay, John and Mandy!"

Stayed a few nights","John and Mandy were amazing hosts! The whole process and everything was very smooth, pleasant, exactly what was listed! The area was so beautiful and breath taking…. The view were amazing! The location was a very good location…. John helped us keep updated on the weather and storms, he helped guide us on the best possible route and roads to take….. John was very responsive thru the whole process and also the whole weekend…. He and Mandy made sure to message us and tell us to have a good visit, to relax and enjoy our time and visit, and also to check and see if we needed anything and that they would help us gather stuff for fire pit and help bring us stuff to start a fire…..I would definitely recommend and highly recommend to friends, family who want to enjoy a quiet, peaceful and secluded getaway or vacation….I hands down would have to say that we were and are blessed with the best hosts ever! It will be definitely hard to find better people then these two…. There’s a whole lot to say!"

The place was extremely clean. The beds were comfortable. The environment was peaceful, and I just couldn’t say anything better about the accommodations. As a matter of fact, he even gives you the ability to buy his farm, fresh steaks and eggs, which are probably the best you’ll ever have. Thank you guys for your tremendous hospitality.

We had dinner and breakfast at the home and the kitchen and dining areas worked great for us. There were two areas to watch TV which was nice to be able to watch different things. This house is in a very nice neighborhood and in a peaceful country setting with lots of space. I can see how this place is perfect for business or large groups with its set up and number of bedrooms. The beds were very comfortable. The hosts were very responsive and helpful. I would highly recommend this place and will stay again if we stay in Kearney. Thank you for the great hospitality! Kandi

Stayed with kids","Our family gathered for thanksgiving and had a great time. The rack in the entry was a great place for everyone to put their coat, shoes and other belongings as they entered. The upstairs gathering space seemed small for the number of people who stayed there but we made it work. Everything was very clean and the host was very accommodating. There was lots of parking and it was warm enough the first night that we were able to enjoy the fire pit. We brought our camper and would have liked to have a 30 amp plug in so we could use electric heaters instead of propane. We plan to use this VRBO again next year."

Stayed with kids","highly recommend this B&B.
of all the B&B’s we’ve been in since our family has grown to 10 adults and children, none have been as well suited to accommodate adults and children as this one. plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms to allow for the varied needs of moms, dads, kids, and grandparents. great open spaces for gathering for meals and socializing. both our grown children said it’s been the best B&B set up they have experienced.
the hosts were nice to send welcoming messages and were quick to respond to questions.
don’t know when our family will be back in the area again, but this B&B will certainly be the first place we check for availability. thanks for a memorable and comfortable stay."

Group trip","We really enjoyed the place. It was just outside of the city by a few mins, so lots of green space, trees and wild life. The house was clean, check-in was easy. Host was good about responding to messages.
There was 12 of us there, but only 2 showers, so it took a long time to get through the shower schedule. The big basement room helped keep the girls entertained, b/c they could watch a movie on the big screen!
I was hoping to use the gym and washer/dryer, but didn't see until it was too late that I would have needed to get that figured out ahead of time. Since we were only staying one night, I didn't bother reaching out once I figured out I needed to request access.
Overall, I would definitely recommend and would stay there again with a large group."

Let him know in advance what we had planned for and people changed but he was aware. I’m someone who tries to leave things better than I found it, saw trash in the yard and picked it up, asked if we could grill and they made sure it was available. We loved that we had a place to clean up and store food post grad where we could relax and just enjoy the home feeling vs hotel Jenga blocks. Adorable in decor. My daughter enjoyed the chattering she had with the decor birds. 😂 it was so calming for me I didn’t want to go home!"

The shower had excellent pressure and temperature. The neighborhood is quiet. Gordon was proactive in contacting us ahead of time and was responsive when we needed help navigating the controls on the Smart TV. The leather sofa and chair reclined, and throw blankets were provided for cozying up. The house was cheerfully decorated for the holidays. We hosted a family holiday gathering at The Cottage, and everybody loved it. We had all the kitchenware that we needed. We played one of the games that were provided. We decided we want to ask Gordon & Elizabeth for decorating advice because the home was more beautiful than anything we could have created ourselves. Our family made wonderful memories in this house and will definitely be back for a future stay. Thank you, Airbnb, Gordon, and Elizabeth!"

Stayed with a pet","We rented this place for a trip with my kids and parents to see the sandhill cranes. Not only was the location great for that - it's about 15-20 minutes to great sites for bird watching - but the house is an absolute treasure. It was spotless, with plenty of space to sleep the six of us, and Gordon and Elizabeth were super helpful and flexible when we ran into last minute dog sitting problems. It's a very dog friendly house, just be aware there's no fence and you'll need to bring a lead if you want to let your dog hang out outside. The weather was snowy and icy while we were there, but the house was well outfitted with deicer and the driveway was shoveled really quickly."

Stayed a few nights","Five Star Stay in Kearney. While the town, isn’t terribly small, it is definitely a small town. We drove through freezing rain & ice & arrived at the cottage after dark. The exterior/interiors lights were on, checkin was a breeze; we were in the warmth almost immediately! The cottage was charming & spotless and the basket of welcome snacks were a hit.
This bathroom is updated, so clean, & has gorgeous glass shower. The only thing we ran into - it’s really one person in the bathroom at a time while showering…the water pressure was great and stayed warm for four back to back girl showers 😂😂
The bedrooms were good size, with comfortable bedding. Living/dining area was very functional, much larger than expected. We played battleship- lots of games provided. Kitchen was well stocked-really appreciate the storage containers.
No unusual checkout requirements.
For light sleepers, it’s very quiet at night, so when someone went to the bathroom, my light sleeper was awake as well."

We all appreciated the little ""bird-y"" touches throughout the house from the crane photo to the avian bric-a-brac. If you stay here, be prepared to want to take the couch home--it's wonderfully comfortable. The furniture in general is designed to make you feel at home and the seating arrangements are thoughtful.

We could have stayed for months and been happy. Everything worked, everything was exactly as pictured, and every room had exactly what we needed. The house is in the middle of town, so it took us about five minutes to get anywhere. The kitchen is well-equipped. The living room has a big couch and a comfortable recliner, plus a big TV and board games. The beds are comfortable. It snowed while we were there, so we really appreciated the enclosed porch in the back where the kids could keep their boots and coats. The house was very clean. It was perfect."

Not planned but one of the best surprises during our stay was Kearney cruise night passing in front of the house. We were able to sit on the porch and watch the parade and happy families.
Overall we had a great stay and would definitely recommend to others staying in the Kearny area."

I was pleasantly surprised: the master suite is on the main floor, and the remaining rooms, and additional bath, are upstairs. An additional fridge is in the “garage,” but the kitchen was really well supplied. We have two small children, so we were happy to find games in a cabinet, baby spoons in the drawer, and even a step stool. If I had to guess, SueZan is a much-loved grandma.
Loved our stay; we will definitely return when we can!"

We enjoyed the game area in the basement and the front porch with chairs and a porch swing to sit out and enjoy the nice weather as well as the fenced in back area with the grill, table and firepit.
Bedrooms were spacious and sitting areas on upper level were a bonus. There were no unbreakable dishes or glasses for small children so you may want to bring them as well as storage containers for left overs.
It was great to be just a block away from a reasonably priced grocery store as well as a few blocks from a Walgreens.
The host responded immediately to any questions we had which we greatly appreciated.
The city of Kearney is amazing especially considering its size. We thoroughly enjoyed the Children's Museum, park with 3 playground areas, walking trail around a lake, and observation tower and very nice bike trail which went for several miles.
We would definitely consider staying again and it was centrally located for our family from Colorado and eastern Iowa."

She left us some snacks on the counter! We had everything we needed. I especially like that the surfaces were clutter free so that we had room to put our things.

W/D was a real plus too. Location is more industrial and near where trains pass by, but I happen to love the sound of a train and it wasn’t loud to me at all.
Just down the street is the Main Street in a quaint little city. We loved the selection of shops and eateries, and music was playing over speakers on this street. That made for a nice walk with our dogs after having pizza and some drinks at Platte Valley Taphouse…dogs welcome on the patio. The owner and patrons were so friendly and nice. An all-around very pleasant stay for this couple and their dogs who felt very welcomed!"

Stayed with a pet","Very nice Boho -- the owners are definitely taking good care of the place and put a lot of effort in upgrading it
The location is in a more ""industrial"" side of town with a few trains that we were not used to...but this should not change our mind about selecting this place.
I like the fenced in backyard -- this helped our pooch feel more comfortable
We do like our coffee in the morning (and we are older generation) so a standard coffee maker on site would be great. Using the Keurig is not my favorite appliance. Luckily we had some instant coffee and did try to use the Keurig machine
A suggestion - this would be a great place for the crane watchers that come into town in Early March into April -- since the location is so close to the best places for cranewatching along the Platte -- you should advertise this! It was so convenient for us.
I love all your improvements to the house -- they made it very comfortable."

Extra towels, sheets, toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent and garbage bags were p provided and was awesome! Having a washer, dryer and dishwasher was perfect!

She and Joey provide great local recommendations; we tried many and loved them all. Both are very responsive and provide proactive, timely and clear communications. We were there to take in the sandhill crane migration: breathtaking! And we felt very comfortable coming and going. While we did not spend time in the private yard, it looks inviting and like a great space in warmer weather. We’d definitely come and stay here again!"

Wish we had a longer stay here to finish the puzzles and play in the spacious back yard!
Train was heard but not an issue at all, was actually really cool. Loved the decor! House was immaculately clean. We felt safe staying here. Grateful for the self check in as we arrived later in the evening. Quick communication for our last minute reservation as well.

Stayed with kids","We booked at the Boho cottage on our way back to Colorado from our holiday trip out east and needed a place to stay in the area after our first booking canceled. I’m not sure if the price had been increased for the holiday weekend but it was a little more than I would expect to pay for that small of a space. It is a super cute, clean and nice space but pretty small for 5 people. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable, however both futon/couch beds in the living area were not comfortable at all. The kitchen was well stocked as the bathroom with very nice touches and comforts. We had fun playing Nintendo and the TV was nice as well.
It is right next to train tracks but surprising not that loud. It was a good place for 1 night with limited options and Joey was very friendly and responsive."

Also, as listed, the trains run by all night but there was no whistles and, mostly, you just felt the rumble but not obnoxious enough to wake you. We did hear a ""slam"" noise a half dozen times or so from the bedroom throughout the night. We never did figure that out. Overall, if you're driving through and need a place to stop for a quick night, not bad at all. The trash man even waited for me while a ran our garbage out to him as we were leaving :)"

It was a short trip to the fair grounds in Kearney for the teamster events we attended, and not too far from the State Fair in Grand Island. We found plenty to do over the weekend. If we're ever in the area again, we will for sure book this cozy place!

Stayed a few nights","What a great home- clean, comfortable and awesome air conditioning during a hot Midwest summer. Joey and his wife were so friendly and responsive (even when we accidentally turned off the dimmer switch in the bathroom- lol)! Would definitely stay there again- no question! I do understand the reviews that state that it looks a little sketchy at first from outside and the surroundings, but It was 100% safe and comfortable and the “next door neighbor’s reputation” was a nonentity for us. Both times we saw him, he was friendly. So overall- an awesome value and incredible hosts!"

Stayed one night","This little place was super cute on the inside and very clean! The beds were comfortable and the little kitchen had what we needed for a quick, overnight stay. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making it a comfortable space.
There were a few challenges, though. There are only 2 AC units in the cottage which leave the kitchen & bathroom/laundry room very warm. The AC unit in the living room cools only enough to make the room temperate. I would advise you bring several fans with you to make your stay more comfortable in the summer months.
Though the landlords have no control over the next items, it's good to be aware before you arrive: the neighborhood is rather industrial and a little sketchy looking/feeling. Which feeling is unfortunately augmented by some very unfriendly neighbors that share the driveway with cottage renters. Since street parking is allowed, I would advise you leave your car on the curb so as to avoid the neighbors' space altogether."

Stayed one night","This was a great little place to stay on a roadtrip passing through. It was clean, beautiful and had everything you'd need (and more!). The bathroom is stocked with toiletries (even bath bombs), the kitchen with snacks (and a freezer full of veggies, meat and fruit). The swings in the back are a great way to relax after a long day of driving. The bed was comfortable, everything was really clean and they had a fun (and hard!) puzzle that I did watching movies.
Joey was responsive and super kind and friendly. Other than being in a lower end of town with train tracks right outside, it was awesome. (The trains never blast the horn, just rattle by periodically).
As a single woman traveling alone, I always question safety. I felt a little uneasy when I first got there due to the lower end neighborhood by the tracks, but realized pretty quickly it was just the small town feel, not an unsafe neighborhood in the city."

This is a unique and special place--I loved it as soon as I drove up and even more when I walked in. It's a tiny, fully equipped house with a backyard and nice tree in front. Lots of windows and a front and side door with screens. The inside is beautifully furnished and decorated. Nice bathroom with nice toiletries and bath extras. Private, calming. I felt very comfortable. Just my style. Wish I had more time to enjoy the hammock and hanging chairs in the yard. There is a freight train that passes close by. No horn, but you can hear the train. I'm sensitive to noise but it wasn't an issue at all, more of a nostalgic part of the experience. Joey is a great communicator and very responsive. I enjoyed the stay very much!"

You will find a place that you can actually call home even if it is for one night if you’d like. They belong to a very close family with a warm and beautiful connection with nature and full of hospitality. Just on your own, couple looking for a place to relax or a family trip, this place is perfect to spend the time and chill.

Their home is immaculate, with a rich history. They had helpful recommendations right away that allowed us to find the ""The Bricks"" downtown on a nice walk to stretch our legs after the drive and get booked for a Audubon Society crane blind that had been sold out for weeks. The beds were very comfortable and the home was very quiet for a good nights sleep. Staying with Chuck and Mary was perhaps the best AirBnB experience we have ever had."

Chuck and Mary’s Heritage House had everything we needed or wanted to make our stay enjoyable. I don’t want to spoil any surprises, but let me just say we will be back if we are anywhere near Kearney, NE in the future. In terms of bed comfort, hot water or water pressure, Wi-Fi, and coffee availability - it was excellent. There was much more room than we needed for the two of us. The Sandhill crane migration is what brought us to Chuck and Mary’s home and the location to Rowe Sanctuary was perfect! Thank you Chuck and Mary; you truly have a magnificent home with a wonderful history to tell to all that pass through your doors."

Stayed a few nights","Okay everyone, I’ve stayed at quite a few Airbnb’s and Chuck/Mary’s place in Kearney, NE was BY FAR the ABSOLUTE BEST I’VE EVER STAYED AT…times 10, no…times 100! No joke! Everything is absolute gorgeous! Their home has soooo much charm, the originally woodworking is incredible, but the hosts are the kindest, most hospitable people you will ever meet! There are soooo many nice extra “touches” they do, from the beginning to the end…soooo accommodating. If you want to know what “Nebraska Nice” is all about…a at Chuck and Mary’s Heritage House. You will NOT be disappointed. They make you feel so welcome and like your family…from minute one. They’re right there if you need them, but they don’t get in your business either. There are special touches all around their beautiful, quiet property. And the City of Kearney is amazing as well! The people of Nebraska (Kearney specifically) are the definition of kind, nice and hospitable. Thank you thank you thank you Mary and Chuck…for everything!!!"

Stayed with kids","Staying at Mary and Chucks’s home wasn’t like any other Airbnb experience we have ever had. It was like visiting family! They didn’t just provide a beautiful and cozy place to sleep, they took care of us. Our family is traveling to all 50 states and after a long journey we needed an oasis, and that is exactly what we got. If you are traveling through or near Kearney, Nebraska, Mary and Chuck’s Heritage House is a must!!!
Mary and Chuck,
Thank you for giving us wonderful memories that will last a lifetime.
Sincerely,
The Ciruelos Family"

Stayed one night",This was by far the best Airbnb I’ve ever personally stayed at. Mary went above and beyond for our one night with them. The beds were amazing. The space was so clean and the hosts were friendly and made the stay perfect. If I ever stay in Kearney again it will be only at Chuck and. Mary’s. Do yourself a favor and book this place.

In the morning we came out to find Chuck cleaning our car! Truly some above and beyond hosts. I'd give them six stars if I could."

The beds were super comfortable, coffee and other drinks were provided, and the space was perfect. Our hosts thought of everything and more with chocolates on the pillows and even oversized bath robes. We definitely hope to stay here again sometime for a longer period and make use of the lovely outdoor garden area they have created. Thanks for hosting us!"

They were enthusiastic about answering any questions, both before we got to Kearney, and especially once we were there. They clearly love running an AirBnB, and add so many fun little touches to everything! We and our two children (9 and 12) greatly enjoyed finding all the little gems and staying in their home. You cannot go wrong with this rental!"

The landscape is beautifully maintained, their garden is peaceful, and the outdoor patio/pergola is so charming & relaxing. Chuck & Mary are SUCH sweet, kind, interesting and friendly people. You will NOT regret booking your stay at the Heritage House!!
Chuck & Mary: It was so good to see the both of you again!! 💞 Thank you for being such wonderful hosts; you guys are awesome. I hope your Memorial Day weekend with your family went well! Hope to see you guys again on a future visit to Kearney. Take care and God bless you both..."

Chuck and Mary are what the Airbnb experience is all about! Clean and cozy-- but the company is what makes this stay worth it the most. Can't wait to come back again and stay awhile.

Stayed one night","We had the opportunity to stay here recently. It looked great online, but was even more amazing in person. Along w/the house being so cozy & full of history, Chuck & Mary made our stay SO much more wonderful! The rich history in the house was so intriguing! Talking w/Chuck & Mary was SUCH a delight; we truly wished we would've had more time to talk to them. They were so understanding w/us; on our way to check in, 2 older gentlemen had just hit a deer. We stopped to make sure everyone was ok, & waited w/them until the sheriff came. Chuck & Mary were so kind to us (even though they had to stay up later bc of us). Chuck & Mary are genuinely nice people. The house alone would have been a great place to stay, but Chuck & Mary made our stay a remarkable one! We enjoyed the secret garden, what the jars of grape jelly were for, the Sandhill crane sculptures, the Jon Crane artwork & more! Thank you guys for your kindness & hospitality! Both you guys & your home meant a lot to us...💜"

Stayed a few nights","I finally realized my dream of seeing the Sandhill Crane migration in Kearney this year, and Chuck and Mary provided the perfect homebase for resting and recharging each day. They were both so warm and friendly, as if we were old friends, and they helped me locate great places to eat as well as view the wildlife. You will be staying on the second floor of the home where they live, but your space will feel very private and quiet.
All of the other reviews are spot on -- Chuck and Mary have thought of everything to make your visit to Kearney a memorable one. I plan to return again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Mary and Chuck were super-super-super mega hosts! From personalized welcome signs and our own newsletter to plush robes laid out to wear after shower or spa, every detail was perfect. Even though our suite was private and complete, Chuck and Mary were at our beck and call for every need.
Beds were super clean and comfy, fridge was stocked with drinks, snacks were available, and brochures and pamphlets for all the places we might be inclined to go were out. Chuck, member of the historical board, even gave us a tour. Heritage House is a trip in itself - there is so much history there.
We came to see cranes and see them we did. We got beautiful pictures and wonderful videos. We were about fifteen minutes from Rowe Sanctuary and even closer to Fort Kearney, both awesome viewing areas.
Chuck and Mary attended every detail and more than earn the highest rating possible and then some. They and their home were awesome. We would all highly recommend the Heritage House for your next stay."

If you are in the Kearney Nebraska area and you are scrolling through the available Air BnB’s, stop now. This is the place!
We have been using Air BnB since 2016 and this place is at the top of our list of best stays ever.
Everything you have read in previous reviews is true, tenfold.
We were warmly welcomed and felt “at home” immediately. So many extra special nice touches that really made us feel welcome - too many to count (I wouldn’t want to ruin the surprises for you).
Look no further. The Heritage House is the best of the best and Chuck and Mary are amazing hosts."

Everything you could want has been thought of already. The extra touches (literally chocolate on your pillow) have already been taken care of. The space has plenty of room in the sitting area for four people, the rooms are large with nice queen beds in each, and the shower is wonderful. The mini-fridge keeps your items cold and you have a choice of two coffee pots for your morning brew or tea. The grounds are immaculate and Chuck and Mary are the most hospitable hosts we have ever experienced. If there is ever such a thing as a Super, Super host, Chuck and Mary are it. Read the description and check out the pictures. Everything is exactly as described and shown in the photos. We will surely stay again if ever in the area."

Their flower gardens were beautiful and the added touch of bouquets in the rooms brightened our day after many hours in the car.

(we had been on the road for 14+ hours and arrived after midnight) I was blown away as well as wife and son with your cleanliness, attention to detail, spaciousness, and personal welcome messages with our names on them. I really loved all of your rich historical mementos about the house and from previous guests - MY FAVORITE PART! (I love personal stories) The beer and wine in the fridge were just the extra steps and granola bars, coffee, and chocolate snacks were on the pillows. (I had a beer for breakfast lol)
I loved the quilts and the beds and the pillows all so very soft.
The garden was so lovely, the hot tub (we hope to share a glass of wine and a story next time), and the neighborhood was the most quaint.
I felt like we were teleported to another place and time inside your upstairs.
This Airbnb is a must stay!"

Group trip",Above and beyond hospitality! Stayed here with a group of 5 for a college friend’s wedding and had a wonderful stay. We weren’t around the house much but wish we were to enjoy the beautiful outdoor area more! Chuck and Mary were amazing - they made sure we were settled and had everything we needed. Wonderful to converse with but also respectful of our privacy. Such caring and kind individuals. The space was good for our group- if I am ever in Kearney again I know where I will stay!

It would be excellent in any locale, but the icing on the delicious cupcake? Chuck and Mary. Hosts in the very best sense of the word, Nebraska-boosters, knowledgeable, helpful, AND Chuck’s an A+ baker and generous enough to share. Exceptional people.
Seriously, stay here if you go to Kearney for the cranes or any other reason. It’s a haven and a treat. We are so grateful for having found this wondrous spot."

It felt like going to stay with an old friend who knew exactly what you'd need for your visit and was around if you needed something else but was going to leave you be otherwise. The rooms were bright and sunny with plenty of pillows for curling up with a good book and the beds were remarkably comfortable. There were fresh flowers in vases throughout - such a delight after driving through snow on the way there."

Stayed one night","Wonderful home that is only eclipsed by the exceptional people who care for the historic piece of Nebraska charm. It had everything we could possibly want, need, and so much more than I thought to imagine.
I wish we could have stayed longer; Chuck & Mary welcomed us at almost 9:45pm with spunk and energy despite the late hour, showed us around, and had cute touches all over the home to give our family a perfect stay. I won’t spoil any of their surprises, but if you’re lucky enough to book a night or two, you will be the hero of your group for finding this local gem.
Chuck has managed to maintain and restore all of the historic integrity, while adding a bunch of contemporary technologies that hang in the background but make the stay more comfortable. 1888 “thank you’s” and we hope to be back again some day!!"

Chuck and Mary were very gracious in our communications and personally welcomed us with such cute and kind notes. We were very thankful to be able to stay there and loved it all.
Guests should note that the rooms are up a super cute and narrow staircase. Wasn’t a problem at all - but one suitcase at a time works best 😊"

We relaxed in the hot-tub and used the sitting room to wake up slowly with coffee in the morning (October was too chilly for sitting in the pergola). Chuck and Mary even gave us a list of interesting places to look for on our way back west and a car bouquet upon leaving. Book this place immediately!

Stayed a few nights","Awesome airbnb! I highly recommend this property.
Chuck and Mary are great hosts; friendly, welcoming, and have put a lot of effort into making a guest's stay pleasant. It's a historic old home, but doesn't feel like the typical old home, didn't have the creaks and things typical old homes have. Was sound and quiet.
They personally welcomed us even though we arrived late and showed us where to park (plenty of parking) and took us on a tour of the home. Also wished us a good morning each morning and made sure we had everything we needed.
The set up is awesome, three bedrooms that are separate from their living area, and also separated pretty good from the other guest rooms. Chuck and Mary had welcome signs and gifts for us; there's a coffee bar, a mini fridge, a tv, and nice sitting area. Beds are very comfortable. Nice patio area with covered pergola. Internet was just fine.
The bathroom is clean and fully stocked with linens and essentials. Honestly, I've typically been more of a hotel traveler because I like the conveniences of coffee, fully stocked bathrooms, etc that can be hit and miss at airbnbs. All those luxuries are taken care of at Chuck and Mary's.
One of my travel companions is a frequent airbnb user and commented this is the best airbnb he's seen. If we're every back in the Kearney area we'll be staying at Chuck and Mary's and I recommend you do to."

It was a lot of fun to just walk around the space and see all of the pictures and historical items. It was kind of like visiting our own little Kearney museum. I was welcomed next to the house by Chuck, who pointed me in the direction of the garage where I parked my car for the evening. Chuck and Mary were very kind and welcoming, and they have thought of every detail. We were traveling with a kiddo and were pleased to find juice boxes and snacks, homemade banana bread, as well as toys and a variety of children’s books to keep him occupied. We definitely felt like welcome guests in their home and will look forward to booking again."

They helped us with our luggage and showed us around their guest suite full of character and thoughtful touches at every turn. They even had lovely beverages waiting for us. The beds and rooms were very comfortable, and we woke to delicious smells from the kitchen where Chuck was making a second loaf of banana bread with no nuts after he learned about an allergy in our family.

Stayed one night","Rachel was warm and responsive to my request on behalf of my daughter. Our daughter had had a scary experience at a chain hotel (being followed and verbally accosted in the parking lot), so it was a relief to have a safe, quiet, and beautiful place to stay. Rachel's tiny home is ""totally adorable,"" our daughter raved. ""It's so nice to be safe and not to have to unpack the whole car!""
Thank you, Rachel. We will stay again on our next cross-country trip."

Stayed a few nights","Wow, hands down the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. I loved this tiny home. It was perfect!! I’ve wanted to live in one and staying here just confirmed how much I’d enjoy it. Great use of space, excellent decor and amenities. You’ll have everything you’ll need plus the added bonus of a serene environment complete with fire pit and hot tub! We got a surprise visit from the neighbours dog Primrose, the most loving and well behaved pup! The host was super helpful and quick to respond. If I’m ever in Kearney Nebraska again, I hope this place is available. Thanks Rachel for an incredible stay!"

The location of the tiny house was very convenient because the cranes were in the fields nearby and we were only a 10 minute drive from good viewing locations on the river. As for the house itself, it was comfortable, clean, and cozy. Staying in a tiny house instead of an ordinary hotel room made the whole trip feel extra special. I would definitely come stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","We came up to see the Sandhill Cranes during migration. We chose this spot for its proximity to corn fields and the cranes and it did not disappoint. They flew over the yard and were in the adjacent corn fields all day. Very cool. Our stay was easy. I think Rachel did a good job of describing her tiny home. I didn’t realize the steps would be a bit steep up to the bedroom and we wouldn’t be able to stand up in the bedroom, but we adapted and did just fine. The stairs had a sturdy handrail and the bed was comfortable. She had plenty of amenities. We hope to return one day."

We really appreciated the Brita pitcher in the fridge! Really convenient to The Archway Monument Museum and to the roadside blinds for crane viewing!
Rachel was responsive to messages and very helpful. There were also a few coupons for dinner places and we used one for Angus Burgers and shakes and it was a great, kid friendly recommendation! My MIL and I would definitely return sans kids to see the cranes again—and definitely stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","The house is really easy to find, pretty secluded location, and super cozy. The house itself has a rustic charm that is very endearing, we loved spending time there. Bonus points because we had a HUGE flyover of American White Pelicans both mornings about 9:30. Literally thousands of birds. It was breath taking. We had a little trouble with the Wi-Fi, Rachel knew exactly how to fix it, gave clear instructions, and it worked perfectly. She also brought us some emergency coffee because we were out, 5 star host indeed.
It is a little close to the highway as some other reviews have pointed out, but it is not bothersome at all. My wife and I still enjoyed the hot tub both evenings and mornings, even got a visit from the neighbor's cat (neighbor's house is well over a hundred yards away and on the other side of a big stand of trees) who is super lovey.
Overall a great place to stay, everything works, it was clean, well maintained. We will definitely be staying there again."

It was very cold and windy during our stay, so the heater inside was unable to keep up. Fortunately, there were enough blankets for us to stay warm at night, and we were busy in town doing other things with family and friends during the day. Overall, it was a lovely secluded little place. It would be a nice place to stay if the weather were nicer. It has a nice deck with a grill and fire pit that would be really fun!"

We had everything we needed and it was exactly what we were looking for...a cozy space where we could relax and spend quality time with each other.

The hot tub was amazing after road tripping from Colorado. heads up if you have kids, make sure to put up the ant trap things if they are out. Also if you plan to use the pack n play be aware that the sleep pad is smaller than the pack n play surface area and may not work for your needs. It rained a little and in the morning the deck was icy so be careful in the colder months."

Stayed one night","Very cute! Nice, rustic feel. I really liked the corrugated steel walls in bathroom and on ceiling.
Nice location with a country feel surrounded by tall grasses, trees and a mowed walking path. While you can hear the traffic from I-80, it was far enough back that it didn't bother much while outside. Outside amenities include swingset, deck / lanai, firepit, extra chairs, decorative lights and a 2-3 person hot tub.
We enjoyed the hot tub after dark; the deck lights made for a nice ambience. Loft was roomy; two adult daughters slept there; I slept on the couch-bed combo.
Very nice space. Caveat for those with adult / teens; the bunkbeds are made for small children, not those past puberty. That said, the top bunk looks like a single full sized mattress might fit.
My only complaint was that I felt the need to dust the ceiling fan before using it; otherwise, a great place, nice location and lovely country / rustic feel with modern accommodations."

Stayed one night","First time in a tiny house and it's amazing what can fit. Everything was clean. We didn't use the TV or the DVD player as we didn't know how to get it showing on the TV. There is a nice selection of movies. When we were there the hot tub looked out of commission and the hammock was messed up so if you want to use probably ask about it. Loved the shower...clean and good water pressure. We are all about 6' tall so the only bed that worked was the queen. The sofa bed was too short, but we made do and the bunk beds were for small children and unfortunately one of the 6' boys had to squeeze in. Would not recommend here if you need larger beds. Obviously not the room for it, but our first time so we didn't know better. We wouldn't be able to stay here again, but it truly was a good experience."

The upstairs was comfortable, but requires some agility to get up there. Otherwise, the place was as described and we had a good stay there. We did have the outdoor lights turned out to avoid the bug issue other guests had mentioned. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our meals there. We enjoyed walking the biking trail and watching the sun set."

Stayed with kids","The host was kind and helpful. The tiny home was cute on the outside. We could not really hang outside unfortunately, we got attacked by mosquitoes and headed inside. Even inside after keeping the door closed it had many insects that got in.
We ended up having to set up our baby tent to utilize the net mesh to protect our toddler and ourselves from being bitten at night by the mosquitoes. We didn’t get the full experience of this place unfortunately because of that.
Another issue we encountered was the water. Not sure if there is a filter or if you could add one but the water was grey and smelled like sulfur. We skipped baths and showers. And took off right away when the sun came up.
The bugs got into our van too. We see why the area is filled with birds, lots of snacks for them. We are so sad our experience was not the best.
Pluses are we appreciated the tv and dvd set up as it helped calm our toddler after a long road trip. It had a cute space for kiddos and the loft space."

I’ve stayed in numerous Tiny Houses, and this one is especially nice in terms of design and layout. Has many amenities for a Tiny House. This is one of the rare designs with a staircase built in, so no ladder, but you will need to step up carefully and then crawl the last few feet to the bed, so keep this in mind. so for anyone wanting to try the Tiny House experience, this one is not to be missed. Very fun. Very comfy."

The triple bunk beds for little kiddos was adorable. it's a nice space back there and we used it to store all our bags and as a dressing room. The kitchen was very clean & easy to use. The bathroom was surprisingly roomy and the shower was great. Towels and linens were very high quality. My husband and I stayed on the converted couch which was nice and firm. We slept really well. My sister slept in the upstairs loft which was very cool and comfortable for her, just needed to be careful walking back down. We had everything we needed and the location was great for going out to see the crane migration (April). The host was super nice and we were very pleased."

There were a few safety issues that could be improved, such as adding a chain lock, fire extinguisher, labels for light switches, and treads on the loft stairs/safety handles for left-handers descending. The lock-box ought to be replaced. The road was also blocked by farm equipment during work hours and, with only one access point, cars just have to wait until the combines and wagons move in order to proceed south on Sweetwater during work hours. The grounds are nice for walking around, and the setting is very nice for just enjoying time on the deck."

Group trip","Adam's place was a comfortable, clean, and well-furnished home base for us during the UNK graduation events. The house is nicely situated in the city... close to campus and to amenities and restaurants. The neighborhood is remarkably quiet, and the fire pit area in the backyard is a relaxing place to gather and enjoy some down time.
We recommend Adam's place to anyone seeking a house experience in Kearney for a few nights. We enjoyed our stay."

Adam didn’t get back to us on a few things. Response wasn’t in a timely matter.
Dishwasher didn’t work, Xbox didn’t work, fuse ball table was broken, which are amenities we were to be able to use. Sheets and linens in the dryer still, there were stains on the basement bedding. Bathtub was a little claustrophobic for us!"

We would absolutely stay here again and wish we could have been there for longer to explore the property.
It was a bit chilly the night we were there and had to have the heat on. Unfortunately the heating unit was quite loud (but very effective) and would kick on and off throughout the night. It would have been easily manageable with ear plugs."

It was cute, but very small. The super cute front porch area does not have a nice view...it is of a large fence, another house, and a major highway. Also, there was no storage area at all to put stuff and the bathroom was tiny and hard to get ready in.
HOWEVER...this property was very, very clean. It was cutely decorated. The host was fantastic. The bed was hard to get into but surprisingly comfortable. If I were to travel alone or with my husband, I would stay here again for a night or two. I would also recommend this stay to others, but give them full details to know what to expect."

Stayed one night","We were there for one night, so the house was clearly too big for us (but WAY better than staying in a hotel). Everything was cozy, clean and easy to figure out. If you are a larger group, you will like the bedroom space, especially if the kids can hang out downstairs in a separate living room area. The kitchen is small, with a tiny table for two. There is a folding table that can be used. For two, the kitchen space was fine. For a large group, it would be less helpful. The backyard space is great for kids/doggos.
A coffee table is needed in the main living room area. The garage was the main reason I wanted the house, since our truck was fully loaded. I should have confirmed the space size as our pickup truck didn't fit. Note that the house sits on a busy road, but road noise wasn't a problem.
The one big negative - I would strongly advise the owners to forego their political views, featured as the password to the house and their wifi password. Enough already."

I hope to be able to rent it again in the future!"

Group trip","Five girlfriend get-together..halfway between CO and MN.. personally we liked being able to do our own cooking, listen to music, dance, play games and just hang out together in our own space. Shad and Ceann's airbnb was clean and in a nice, central location not far from shopping and dining.. and a short drive to Cottonmill Park. Fenced in back yard and patio table was a plus, also the garage to park our two cars was nice! Shad and Ceann were very accommodating. In speaking for myself and the other girls, we all agreed this airbnb was a good find and we'd definitely go back!"

Group trip","Awesome place to stay with great amenities. They provided towels, extra blankets, toothbrushes, tooth paste, shampoo, condition, more than enough of what we needed for my bowling team to stay for a weekend. Even an extra table and chairs which came in handy when playing cards and eating a meal together. It was a great time! The basement space is a tad chilly compared to the upstairs. Turning the thermostat up will cook the upstairs out while the downstairs remains a bit chilly. Perhaps an extra spare heater would be nice. But it wasn’t anything to ruin the stay by any means. Overall, really appreciated everything!"

Stayed with a pet","This house was a great alternative to a hotel stay for our extended family that came into town, from different areas, to attend a wedding. Great communication with the hosts, everything is as represented in the listing. The home was clean and updated, beds were comfy, plenty of towels and extra blankets, etc., lots of space for congregating and visiting—upstairs and in the basement—with enough room for having your privacy when needed.
As a pet-friendly BnB, the fenced back yard was a perfect area for our furry family members to safely romp and play and have some outdoor time without the need of a leash. Lots of off-street parking area in the driveway, thoughtful touches throughout like bottled water in the fridge, a snack basket in the kitchen, and essential oil diffuser in family room.
We would definitely stay here again the next time a family event brings us to Kearney.
Thank you Shad and Ceann!"

Stayed with kids","We had a family trip to watch the bird migration and this was a wonderful place to stay. It was stocked with amenities, like lots of Keurig cups, shower supplies, and condiments. It was very comfortable, we used all 4 bedrooms. It was clean and nicely decorated.
The basement had 1 of the bedrooms and bathrooms plus a second living room with a large TV. It was noticeably cooler down there but we all slept well. Plus it has train art on the walls down there and my 5 year old son was in heaven that he got to sleep there.
The hosts were communicative and very nice. It was easy to come and go and we were happy we could use the garage. It was an added bonus that they don't require you to do a ton of cleaning and laundry before you leave. They make it easy on the guests."

Loved being able to have a fenced in area for the dog, so much better than a hotel! Host had thought of so many little details like coffees, travel items (in case you forgot any) and just genuinely made the property so welcoming. It was also really great to be able to park in the garage given it was negative temps and our truck was loaded with belongings. We were very happy after a long day driving. Highly recommended, thanks so much for having us!"

The hosts went above and beyond to get ESPN2 added to their cable package when we mentioned we wanted to watch the NCAA volleyball championship. It was cold outside during our stay, but the heater worked really well. Parking the car in the garage was great for the winter. The house is about a mile from the cute shops and restaurants in downtown Kearney. The hosts thought of everything, including so many adorable Christmas decorations. They responded to every question right away. We highly recommend this home."

Nice backyard and a nice living space downstairs that was perfect for our kiddo to run around.

Stayed with kids","This place is adorable and the beds are really comfortable. The living room has a very warm “home” vibe. Sitting on the couch watching TV felt like I was at home.
The area for our pets was awesome. It took a load of stress off letting our pets roam the yard without worrying they would get out.
We ended up missing our reservation date completely and showed up an entire day late. They first emailed me asking if everything was alright because they were worried about us. They then worked with us and let us stay on the date we got into town instead of when we had reserved it. They could have held us to our date and charged us extra but they were very kind and generous.
They are people I would gladly do business with again and the house is adorable. What else can you ask for?"
