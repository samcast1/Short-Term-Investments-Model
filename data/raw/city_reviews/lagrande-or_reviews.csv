The shower was lovely and there were small details that made it feel homey and cozy- like the blankets on the comfy chairs and the fresh eggs. We enjoyed walking in town for food and drinks. The bed was comfy too!

The room is beautiful, comfortable, has everything we needed and more, and best of all - it was squeeky clean everywhere. If you need a place to stay in LaGrande for one night or more, THIS is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed!"

Stayed one night","So adorable! Very comfortable and homey. Absolutely LOVED the many little touches such as yummy coffee, hot cocoa, breakfast cookies, holiday decor, fresh cream and eggs in the fridge, water bottles, comfy linens, etc. It made the place feel comfortable and extra special! She even had a fresh pot of gorgeous orchids in the kitchen window (my favorite)! I come to the area once or twice a month for work, and love to try new places, but I will definitely be coming back to Judy’s place! Cute, quaint, comfortable, cozy, and perfect in town location!"

Stayed about a week","My husband was recovering from a knee replacement and this was the perfect place! We chose it because there were no stairs like we have at home. Judy and Jack even provided a more comfortable lounger for my husband to enjoy. There were also thoughtful items in the fridge and the kitchen was just right for our needs.
All in all great space and great location.
Would stay again."

Stayed with kids","This is a perfect place to stay if you have kids at EOU or traveling through! Far enough from the train tracks that we didn't hear a thing.
The layout doesn't feel like a studio - there are defined separate areas for the kitchen, living, and sleeping. For example, the king-size bed is partially walled off from the living/kitchen & there is plenty of room between the well-equipped kitchen and living room. The kitchen even has full-size appliances. The washing machine/dryer combo was very cool. I now want one at my house :-)
The place is adorable and the bedding is AMAZING!
One thing of note - if you have a longer vehicle, park on the street (there were plenty of spaces). If you have a smaller car you will do fine in the assigned parking spot."

The kitchen was fully stocked and allowed us to prepare meals. Even though we encountered noise from the unit above the comfortable bed provided a good night's rest. Overall, Heather's place represents an excellent value and we look forward to staying in it again when we revisit La Grande."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this was a very good value. Rates in La Grande are very high this time of year (August), since the area around La Grande provides for summer recreation. Compared to other options, this one was the best value for the money, offering a very clean, fairly new studio unit with plenty of room for two. It's located in an older neighborhood on some low traffic streets. I would stay here again. Mark from Kent, WA"

It is located in a neighborhood at the end of a road , providing privacy and lovely surroundings- pasture and mountains can be seen. It is cozy, comfortable for 2 people, and very nicely appointed as Sarah has thought of “extras” one might need when traveling. High quality bedding and towels a bonus. And clean! I wish more were as clean and tidy as this stay. We will definitely book again when we have the need to stop in the La Grande area. Thank you Sarah!"

One tip: you may find your self stuck for AGES at the train crossing where H and Adams/30. If you see a train on the tracks turn around and take Island Ave to Albany St (by the Wendy’s). You can then take 21st street all the way to H and it’ll avoid the long waits on the train."

Mornings were special with a full assortment of coffee and creamers to choose from. The kitchen is really well stocked with everything you need to cook and serve. We especially appreciated the filtered water pitcher in the fridge and the good supply of ice and ice cube trays. What a treat to have access to two bicycles and a lock. We enjoyed our ride around town. Sarah has set the bar high for other hosts with her beautiful accommodations, great communications and thoughtful extras. So glad we discovered Sarah's Couples Getaway. It was far superior to the basic hotel stay we would have normally done and a much better value for the price."

Even though we didn't use the kitchen, I loved that there was a full stove and oven, great for a take and bake pizza (maybe next time). Homemade touches like place mats and curtains really brighten the place up and the flower accents made me smile.

Once I got inside, I was so excited for my stay. Cute, cozy and absolutely perfect for one person or a couple.
The bed was AMAZING. The kitchen had everything I could possibly need (I was even gifted some organic fresh eggs that were absolutely delicious).
The only thing I would changed is how long I stay next time because I could have easily enjoyed another day or two!
Thank you so much Sarah for such a comfortable stay and your hospitality."

The bathroom was stocked with any toiletry that you could need. The back deck is charming, with plenty of birds and other animals to watch, including a few chickens in back (who must have provided the fresh eggs in the fridge). The location is convenient and super quiet. Overall, this was a perfect base for exploring this part of northeastern Oregon, and we'd love to come back for another stay."

It is inviting, smells wonderful, and honestly I would live here! My partner & I were supposed to stay in another Airbnb and it didn’t work out. I was able to book this last minute, and as someone that has spent a lot of nights away from home, this is SUPERIOR to other places. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought we were the first people to stay in this Airbnb (that’s how clean it was). It’s in a great location away from others, there’s a stream that goes on the side of the building, and chickens! So cute! Also close to places to get a late bite as well as gas stations for quick necessities, and close to the highway. The check in process was easy breezy and owner communication was quick and so nice! The washer and dryer is EXCELLENT! The AC is wonderful and kept the place super cool. There was sweet little touches all around. Do not hesitate to book this place! We will be back :)"

Stayed a few nights","This little ""tiny home"" style air bnb was all we could have hoped for! Very clean, private, and comfortable. We got amazing sleep, and the kitchen had everything we needed, minus a cheesegrater but other than that perfect. Plenty of coffee and creamer provided, seasonings, toiletries, Netflix, washer and dryer, and they even left us lindor truffles and fresh eggs from their chickens! We will be returning again on a future getaway! Loved it. 5 stars"

Stayed a few nights","Yurt and tub were great, but bring earplugs. The yurt was well-appointed and comfortable. Tub was wonderful, in a lovely patio setting. But, loud neighbor late into the night in the yurt next door marred an otherwise great experience. To make matters worse, the host was unable or unwilling to correct the issue after we complained. The yurt displays quiet hours, but these don't seem to be enforced. For the price that is being charged, I would expect an on-site host to be available and at least trying to enforce the quiet hours."

Stayed a few nights","Apparently we missed the part that there was no restroom/shower attached to the yurt. To use a restroom, you had to walk about 75 yds to the facility, which was actually warm and spotless. But, in the middle of the night, wind blowing 30 mph, it was a miserable trip(s) Also, if you wanted to shower before/after the soaking tub, again, a walk of 75 yds. Maybe an additional garbage bag, with 4 people, we filled the small garbage can in one evening. Otherwise, this was an absolutely ideal accommodation, spotlessly clean, comfortable, private, heated thermal floors, fantastic! But, without the restroom/shower, definitely pricey..."

Stayed one night",What a wonderful place to stay overnight. Extremely romantic. To have a hot tub all to yourself with fresh Mineral Spring water pumped in from the source is outstanding. The yurt was incredibly clean and fresh and the bedding was absolutely spotless. They provided all the amenities necessary for an overnight stay. There was a storm that night while we were sleeping and it caused the pump to shut down. We called our house up and they had it repaired within an hour. We were still able to get in our morning soak without being inconvenienced in any way. We would definitely recommend anyone who's willing to go out of the way to come to this place and enjoy it as much as we have. We plan on coming back here as often as we possibly can.

Stayed one night","I will be returning often. So peaceful! The winter season has lots of availability; in my opinion that’s the best time to go to hot springs in general. There is so much fascinating history in this area. This location is really close the ominous Hot Lake Hotel. I love historical buildings; this one did not disappoint. The Yurt #2 that we stayed in has the perfect tub for 1 to 2 couples. I would not recommend more than 4 adults as the yurt is small and cozy. It was perfect for us! We went with one other couple and we had such a sweet time. Really clean and beautiful! I highly recommend the Yurts with private tubs! I really look forward to our next visit.
*no kitchen; we brought veggie platters, crackers and dips. There is a gas grill and we did bring beyond burgers. We forgot a cutting board, plates etc., so we skipped it. No biggie for us at all! I’m only mentioning it so if you do want to use the grill, make sure you bring plates etc.
5 STARS!"

The beds were very small and short~ certainly not made for tall people (I struggled to stretch out straight and I'm only 5'5"") and the soaking tub only fits 2 adults comfortably. There were only two of us, and the yurt would have been extremely cramped with more guests. The shared bathroom facilities were very nice and clean. Overall a great little pit stop along our travels."

Stayed one night","Appreciated the private patio and soaking tub, especially since the public pools were pretty small (we didn’t use them). There is a walking path by the creek behind the patio so we did have people looking into the backyard as they passed. Shared bathrooms were clean but a bit of an inconvenience to walk to, so this is like a more expensive version of camping. Something that would really enhance the space would be an outdoor shower (like yurt 1 has) or even a spigot so one can rinse off before or after soaking, or even wash hands. That would keep the tub cleaner too cus then people wouldn’t just get into the tub with their unshowered bodies. Noticed a lot of dead skin in the tub as i was filling it for the first time. There is a cold temp faucet just for the tub but it’s short and hard to use outside of the tub."

All typical inconveniences— like having to go elsewhere for the bathroom, not having plate and utensils—melt away as you leisurely hop in and out of the tub filled with gorgeous spring water that restores and heals. The owners also did a great job with the aesthetics of the place too. Finally, the kids loved splashing around in the bigger pools. So there was something for everyone to enjoy."

And good thing too because every night around dusk and every morning at dawn there were thousands of mosquitos. My son has at least 40 bites all over him from one night at the big soaking tubs. I wish this would have been communicated more clearly so I could have had bug spray and candles as well as long sleeve shirts and pants for everyone at night.
It is a gorgeous place and I really enjoyed the yurt… maybe winter would be a better time."

Stayed one night","We loved the yurt. The beds were clean and comfortable. There was plenty of bedding and towels. The hot tub was perfect. We truly enjoyed the private patio with hot tub, fire circle, bbq, and picnic table. At dusk, the mosquitoes were thick but that's to be expected near the hot springs.
The bathrooms were lovely if a bit of a walk...not too bad. Our only issue was water. We never did find a working spigot. However, we ran into town and easily picked up a couple gallons."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for three nights and left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. The grounds are peaceful and pristinely kept, the bathrooms are the cleanest I have ever seen in any place of this type, and the yurt was comfy and cozy! We used the private tub at least twice a day and especially enjoyed the tub at night - under the stars and watching the fire from the fire pit. Absolutely beautiful. The staff were also quite lovely and helpful. The nearby town of Cove has an awesome steakhouse (and a beautiful drive getting there!) and La Grande is super fun for exploring! Lots of fun antique / thrift stores, bookstores, cute places to get coffee. We went to The Smokehouse twice for some of the best breakfast we’ve ever had. Just a lovely stay all the way around. We look forward to returning! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Yurt life is the good life! We loved our stay at Yurt 2 and would recommend the RV park and the Yurt to cozy friends or small families. It was comfortable for a couple nights but not a lot of room to spread out - definitely not a good place for working, but a GREAT place for relaxing!
The yurt has a bunk bed with full/queen bottom bunk and a twin top bunk; there's also a futon but if you were using that for sleeping there's no other indoor space, which might be necessary for rainy days. Inside there's a mini fridge, coffee maker and all the fixins for a great coffee or tea - in fact, the coffee provided by the Resort is INCREDIBLE.
The back terrace feels pretty private - but there is a nature trail that passes just beyond, which can get active. You are private if sitting in the hot tub but be aware when you stand up!
The hot tub was awesome. Fed by the hot spring, it was extremely hot. The toilets and showers are a short walk away, sparkling clean. Excellent stay!"

We did a short stop off on the communal pool area and it definitely felt more like a typical pool and hot tub than a hotspring but that is pretty clear from the pictures. Mostly kept to the private soaking tub and that part is well worth the stay!!!"

The beds were comfortable, and the private outdoor sitting/dining/grill/hot tub (which guests fill with water from the hot spring) was fantastic. We enjoyed a nice soak under the stars and again in the morning before departing.
All the facilities were clean, and the people were friendly. Union (a quaint town) and LaGrande are nearby. Bonus, there was a Tesla charger onsite allowing us to top off at no additional charge before heading to Joseph, OR.
Many thanks for a great stay. We will be back."

Stayed a few nights","The private yurt was so lovely and cozy! We fit 4 folks and were comfortable. The soaking tub in the back is fed with geothermal water, fills up in maybe 15-20minutes. Make sure to read instructions as the hot water is very hot!
The area is beautiful. Easy to add on a trip to Joseph / Wallowa mountains for the day. It can get windy though, cold in winter, and I'm sure in the summer hot. The yurt stayed warm, and there was an air conditioner.
The beds were comfortable. Bedding and towels provided. Mini fridge and coffee maker provided. The back area had some high fencing to protect from wind and provided privacy. The grill was great to cook with and a burner on the side.
There is a view of the hill behind and sometimes hikers walked by, but that was ok. You do have to walk a little bit to bathrooms but they were squeaky clean. Staff was friendly, helpful. Highly recommend!"

Bathrooms are a short distance away, and seemed very clean. Very glad I chose to stay there!"

There is a hotel down the road at Hot Lake that this is connected to and its a great old place that they are fixing up really nicely. I particularly liked that they had so much history there and a movie theater - with BirdMan playing! The yurt is crazy clean and comfortable with coffee in the morning to get you going and a fridge. Its a little pricey but go ahead and do it."

Things we thought were the cons...we thought if they had a small table or counter at the head of the bed it would have been nice to have some space to put your items.
Overall was a neat adventure and we enjoyed our time."

Stayed a few nights","My kids and I had an awesome time here! Usually I pack our trips full of activities, but this time around, everyone was perfectly content hanging out in the pools and the private tub on the back patio, and relaxing around the yurt and property. I have three children, a 16-year-old, an 8-year-old, and a 7-month-old, and it’s sometimes tough to find activities that everyone enjoys. However, all three of them had a blast!
It was great that we didn’t need to bring any linens or towels. And I brought my propane camping stove, but didn’t need it because there was a burner on the propane barbecue provided on the back patio. That was super convenient.
Another feature we really liked was that the private tub had a cold spigot and a hot spigot. That way we could adjust the temperature as needed. We visited in the summer, when it was very hot. But we were able to adjust the temperature in the tub so that it was just right for the temperature outside. Then, in the evening, we could heat it up and relax in the cooler air.
We had complete privacy on the back patio, and a nice view of the hillside behind us. We were also very thankful for the air conditioning. It was in the high 90s when we were there, but as soon as we entered the yurt, it was a cool 72°.
The staff was super nice, and responded to my questions promptly. Overall, this was a great experience, and I recommend it for anyone!"

She provided a basket with “in case you forgot items” which was toiletries that are often forgotten, I have never seen a host do this and it was amazingly appreciated.
The coffee provided was excellent, I have never had coffee of that quality outside of a specialty coffee shop.
Lastly, the bed was so comfortable and cozy! We fell asleep right away and woke up fully refreshed from our travels."

Soaking in the hot tubs on the private patio in the rain was sweet. The only downside is the walk over to the bathrooms. Probably the cleanest, most designer bathroom I've experienced at a campground. (Don't forget your own soap/shampoo.) We walked over to check out the guest pool/tubs situation and really appreciated the view of the hillside from the deck chairs. I expected the trains to be a problem and took ear plugs, but didn't need them."

Stayed one night","My friend & I was visiting with a lady traveling to the poker tournament in Pendleton, who was soaking & not staying overnight. There was a couple in the hot springs, my friend & I sat in the lounge chairs while the traveler hung out in the pool by herself. The lady had asked if we knew what time it was. Just then, an employee came out dipped a container into the water and said ""It's 5 o'clock & time to get out,"" which she did. My friend & I thought it was very impolite how the employee handled the soaking guest, being the only person in the pool & announcing it for everyone there to hear. She should have leaned in quietly & said something. I actually felt embarrassment for her, and the employee who lacked the manners to deal with the situation tactfully. At 10pm that same night we walked to the bathhouse & there were 3 people still in the hot water pools while several others stood outside the pool. You should enforce rules to Everyone."

The outdoor space was so magical with the fire pit and string lights. Clean and very well maintained. The yurt itself was clean, cozy, and warm. The fridge and coffee maker was nice to have. The bathrooms were in a different building, but we knew that because the description was spot on. What we didn't know was that the bathrooms/showers would be so nice! Clean, warm, and well laid out. The only downside was that the train seemed pretty close to the property, which was loud, but not too disruptive. We visited for only one night in March, and the RV park was pretty empty, but I'm sure it would be full during the summer months."

But the private tubs at the yurt were really nice!
Definitely recommend, the yurt cozy and warm in the winter."

Stayed one night","What an amazing little gem this lovely yurt is with its private and perfectly appointed back patio. The yurt itself was a perfect 74 degrees inside (geothermally heated—including the floor!) even though our stay was in early December with morning temps outside in the teens. The only amenity I wished was included was a microwave, but seriously, everything else that WAS there made this glamping experience the best ever. The restroom is a super short walk away, and it, too, was warm, clean, and welcoming. That all said… we enjoyed the hot-spring tubs on the back patio multiple times, including the morning before we left. The stars above showed bright, and a hoot owl serenaded us from a nearby tree. We did experience an extra roommate (a frog!) for a while, but we only heard him and never did see him. Not certain if he was inside or out, but he quieted down when we banged on the wall. Bottom line, we’ll definitely stay in Yurt #1 again when we’re traveling through La Grande. Two thumbs up!"

Came in a bit later but not too late and had a VERY loud child they allowed to scream and yell till very late. They were all very loud, but thankfully, I had ear plugs. A bit frustrating to us as WAY past the quiet hours posted."

Stayed with kids","Our family absolutely loves this little getaway. It’s private but only a 12 minute drive to la grande city. I have sent many many folks this way because it’s a fantastic & relaxing spot for couples or with the kids. I brought my daughter for a girls trip and it did not disappoint! We even locked ourselves out and the host was there to help us 🖤
The heated floor and personal heat with a huge plus for me, soft towels, beautiful fireplace that’s really easy to use.
Do watch for ants, so if you clean up after yourself you won’t even know they are there.
Only suggestion I would make is to offer bigger, thicker, softer blankets for sleeping.
Thank you so much!! Look forward to many more visits"

Hot water straight from the springs and the lights add a great ambience. The yurt was clean and matched the description, it is a little loud with the campers and such around but they do a quick drive pass on their way out and are gone within minutes. The bathrooms were very clean and well maintained, 10/10. Would recommend and would go back!"

The host was very communicative when there was an issue with the hot water and took care of it very quickly. I know my wife and I both very much look forward to our next stay here. The bathrooms are communal and there was a lot of RV traffic during the time we stayed, but we both couldn’t help but remark how these are the cleanest communal bathrooms we have ever used."

It's a unique experience with the bathtubs apart, but it feels like as if they were together. The water is really clean and good for the skin with a slight sulphur smell. The only thing missing was a little rain shelter to hang the towels and keep them dry. We would definitely go back and rent it again."

Stayed one night","The only addition that they might consider adding is to add the hot springs water is always available at the yurts even when the main pool is closed for the winter season. Also with the Tiny house you get free access to the pools at the lodge but not the yurts. That should be clarified as well. The noon Check out time is nice.
Also there is a heater, floor heat and AC. I don't remember that being in the description. I had to look at the reviews to find out if the yurt would be warm enough in the snow. It was wonderfully warm and perfect. If we rent it again I think I will bring a bathtub pillow to make it more comfortable. Also check the head area of the tub, it was not scrubbed and gray greasy dead skin was smeared there and I scrubbed it off after leaning against it in the dark...gross just a small things to check and for the cleaning staff."

My wife and I have stayed in yurt 1 a few times over the past few years. It's always a very reminiscent place for us. It's the break we need from life without too much travel or hassle. Even for one night. The bathrooms are always very nice and clean. The owners and staff are always very nice and helpful. I know they have a lot of irons in the fire right now. But I wish they would put up more of these rooms like the yurts. The word is out and it has become very difficult to get a booking. Plan way ahead.
We also visited the hotel next-door. We hope to stay there soon too. Ryan in the pub was great."

That is no fault of the space and certainly not a problem for the host. Just unfortunate timing. We didn’t sleep much at all that night due to the noise. On the other hand, the lot was totally private and was a beautiful arctic contrast to the hot tub experience. The local deer spent time with us too!"

Stayed a few nights","Will definitely go again! We were warned about wind, but mother nature had other plans... no wind, which made the mosquitoes come out in full force! Yikes! The building is exactly as described although maybe even more charming. The building is VERY warm on sunny days. Make sure your room radiator is turned off asap or you will have a hot night despite outdoor temps below 40. The window screens have to be put in and out for use - they're not permanently installed. That felt a little awkward considering I could climb out my window and over to another room very easily. Provided fans should fit the windows better and instructions on how to use the ceiling fan and radiator should be more clear. 1st night ""slept"" hot and was grateful for morning, 2nd night had it figured out and slept wonderfully. I heard the train when I was awake but it was not loud enough to wake me from sleep. It will be fun to return and see how they continue to improve this historic gem!"

I hope they eventually build a culinary destination restaurant so you don’t have to leave at all. They have great outdoor seating for it in summertime. The thermal pub is great for a snack.
I enjoyed soaking every day and appreciated that day users have to leave by 8 PM. All the people who were tipsy and rowdy mostly left at a reasonable time when staff asked them to.
The breakfast offerings were great for a light breakfast. My only suggestion is to serve it at the half moon bar in the lobby area adjacent to the Thermal Pub so it doesn’t get too congested.
We will be back!"

Stayed one night","The place is a timecapsule; full of history. It's genuinely peaceful. There are a thousand little details that show thoughtful consideration of design (modernized) and usability within the building. Terry cloth robes and spa like atmosphere in personal bathroom. Extremeyly friendly and helpful staff. The pools are just outside the building, not a long walk which was nice. There are: cubbies for your things and hooks to hang towels, etc.; a privace fense from the hotel; shaded spaces if you need to escape the sun; beautiful fire pits when it gets dark; posted temperatures of each pool/tub hourly; and a resident cat named Rocky. There is a bar with appertizer options. Not much for breakfast aside from a few pieces of fruit, granola bars, and coffee. I wish we didn't have to leave the property to have meals but you can bring food. There is a fridge provided for guest use with a dinning area. Town is about 8 miles away. Over all a wonderful stay and we'll be back. Thank you!!"

Group trip","This is a lovely spot in a very cool old hotel. They are renovating but were clear about that up front and what was being done was quite unobtrusive. The rooms, restaurant, spas, sun rooms and public spaces were all great. The local-made bagels for breakfast were super.
They had personal robes for each guest to walking to and from the tub area was easy and comfortable.
I like the idea of a movie night, available Thu-Sun.
Staff were all very friendly, informative and responsive. The food in the restaurant, although a limited menu, was good and reasonably priced.
There is not much hiking on the property but nearby are several parks - Catherine Creek State Park, Morgan Lake Park, and more that have nice hikes. La Grande has some good restaurants."

Stayed a few nights","We'd stayed about this time last year. We booked for another stay, twice as long as last year, in spite of knowing a few things had not changed. Its tough to justify the room rates when you need to travel to La Grande for restaurants. Granted, the bar has a few offerings, but ones that are warmed up, not prepared fresh. As well... I was hopeful to have found something more along spa services/treatments. It seemed as though nothing had moved in the remodel, and the space was the exact same as last year. We'll likely return, but also looking for a more full service location in the area."

If you plan on soaking bring mosquito repellent. The mosquitoes are hungry and in Great numbers.

The rooms are so charming and tranquil and felt quite luxurious. The pools were a glorious way to start off in the morning and end in the evening. Our stay was absolutely top notch.

Stayed one night","This is a return visit so the Lodge has its charms. We understand they are working to get the restaurant remodeled & working 7 days a week, ditto the movie theater. It is a bit inconvenient to drive back into LaGrande (Monday-Thursday ) for supplies or dinner.
The room we stayed in had a small fridge & microwave so that helped the situation. We wish the lodge had soaking tubs exclusively for lodge guests; as it is, the RV park gets to use the tubs, too, and can seem crowded until 8 pm, when lodge guests are the only designated users. Tubs exclusive to lodge guests WOULD BE A HUGE PLUS.
With “soft” check-ins available (use of soaking tubs until 4 pm check-in), it is a tiny bit better than NO EARLY CHECK-INS, but my friend and I did not want to wear wet suits for long after soaking…so we opted to take a 2 hr drive instead.
In all, the Hot Lakes Lodge has nothing but great potential and it is NICE to see an old, historic building with many past lives coming back to life in this way."

The hot springs are AMAZING - very clean, peaceful and relaxing. I also appreciate that there are various tub temperatures so I can pick how to soak. The whole building is heated by geothermal piping which is really cool but I'll note its hard to control the room temperature at times. La Grande is a 10 minute drive and there are some yummy restaurants - the hotel has some good recommendations. Definitely a great place to visit in Oregon."

Popping up like a mirage in the desert, we we could see the steam rising for miles away. The owners have done a wonderful job sprucing up this dilapidated property. Their incorporation of old and new creates a polished, historic experience we won't soon forget. This is a an old building, that must be said, but great care has been taken to create a warm, relaxing environment for guests. We will be eager to return!"

Super comfortable beds and living space with a mini fridge and microwave. There isn’t a ton to do. It’s a place to chill. With gorgeous public hangout spaces. There is a ping pong table and a mini theater for movie nights when they have them. And no real food just snacks. The pools are incredible the water amazing. If you love to soak and want to relax I highly recommend

Stayed one night","My 2nd stay here and this room is LOVELY. There is much to love about the entire place; not just the soaking tubs! I really enjoy the sitting rooms on each floor. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The fresh cold mineral water stations are a great touch! In the pub, Metta makes a mean charcuterie! 😉. The beds are sooooo comfortable after a soak, and the bathrobes are thoughtful for trekking to and from the tubs.
The hot lake is a beauty and the soaking tubs are luxurious! You have to soak in the evening as well as the next morning before you check out. It’s 2 totally different, equally amazing experiences! My fave is the rock tub, bc I feel almost “one with the lake,” lol.
Heed the instructions to wear heavy shoes. If they blow into the lake, you’re not getting them back!!!
This is a true gem, and I look forward to returning!"

Stayed one night","My family of four really enjoyed our one night stay at the Lodge. Our suite of rooms (Rm 217) gave us tons of space to spread out. My teenager said the pull-out couch in the living room was comfortable.
The uniqueness of the building was fascinating and fun to explore. Although it was a fairly busy weekend( we were there the day before New Years) we were still able to find an open tub. We Skied at Anthony Lakes during the day and drove over for the evening and also soaked the next day. The breakfast is basic, but the bagels are really good, and it’s so nice not to have to leave the property in the morning. There is a beautiful breakfast room to enjoy. The noon check out is great, and makes the morning feel very relaxing. Highly recommend!"

This was my third time staying at the hot springs, overall it was a great mini vacation, although not as relaxing as it previously was. They now have day soak passes which fills up the 5 tubs from about 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. If you are staying in one of their rooms you will likely be sharing a tub during day hours, which does make the experience less relaxing. My time there was still enjoyable and I did a meet some very nice people."

Stayed one night","I’m guessing on everything because we didn’t actually get to make this trip, so I’ve given them 5 stars on everything except accuracy.
A few days before we visited, the host changed their policy and began to allow day guests at the hot springs. We only found this out through Instagram, no one notified us of the change. I messaged for more information and while the host was responsive, their strategy was disappointing- no official cap on the number of day passes, they’re just playing it by ear. With the pandemic numbers way up right now, we couldn’t justify a trip not knowing how crowded the pools would be, so we had to cancel.
This place looks beautiful in the photos and hopefully we can visit someday. For now, I wish the host would be more proactive about sharing changes like this with booked guests so they have all the info they need to make decisions. It would also be nice if they had a more generous cancellation policy, especially if they’re going to change things last minute and make you choose between feeling safe and losing your money."

Even though the lodge is a work in progress, our accommodations were comfortable and relaxing and the hot springs rejuvenating. Do follow the suggestions of bringing a water bottle and shoes to the soaking tubs that will not blow away. The first visit to the tubs was calm and peaceful with the stars above. The next morning the wind was roaring off the hill and even our hydro flasks had to be propped next to the tub to not blow away. I highly recommend you visit."

It was an abandoned run down place at that time, but I knew it was an awesome historical time piece. So glad I waited and was able to experience the place in first class relaxation! The mineral tubs are probably the best part of this place, but staying their really brings you back to a time when simplicity was all you needed. I hope they never add televisions to the rooms. Great way to get away from it all and build a memory of a life time. I hope to return some day."

Stayed with kids","The Lodge at Hot Lake Springs was a fantastic place for our family to stay. The room was spacious and luxurious. The soaking pools were amazing and relaxing, especially at night. The hotel is old and currently under renovations which we were aware of ahead of time. The only reason we gave 4/5 stars is because we needed to open our windows to cool off the room during the heat wave. This let in some bugs from the nearby marsh. They have temporary screens and this should be fixed once they put in permanent screens. We definitely plan on coming back and checking out their progress in the future!"

First up: this charming room is so spacious, with two large bedrooms, one with a desk, separated by a lovely sitting room with an electric fireplace and a large bathroom with a long clawfoot tub. The style of the room is so thoughtful and lovely! Good to note, there is a microwave and a small fridge in the room.
And the hot pools: AMAZING. We had cloud cover, so we couldn't see stars, but the full moon was on full display. The steam rising off Hot Lake creates a wonderful atmosphere.
The overall property is this wonderful blend of historic charm and modern simplicity, and there is plenty of places to have a meeting, read a book, or relax outside of your room. I can't wait until the pub is open."

It's beautiful, clean, a little creepy (but in a really good way), and historic. The lodge is old so sound travels pretty easily so be mindful or your neighbors will. The pools are all CLEAN and so well kept. I can't wait to go back and enjoy the quiet."

Stayed one night","Like stepping back in time to stay at a rustic early-1900s hotel on the Western frontier, only with added modern comforts. Imagine our surprise after using a physical key to open up our suite (Room 217, two bedrooms), only to find a remote-controlled fireplace by the couch in the middle common room! Along with WiFi, this was perfect for finishing a cozy evening watching a western on my laptop after a long soak out on the lakeside deck.
The hot pools do not close at night and were consistently at a perfect temperature of just over 105° (with very minor temperature fluctuations at night) and temp-checked by staff every hour. The tubs' view of the hills, steaming lake, ducks, and sunset were unforgettable. We will be back and can't wait to see what other amenities (theater? on-site kitchen or restaurant?) may eventually be added & opened to guests!
But even before any of those renovations are completed, you won't be disappointed by what they offer now: daily delivery of custom dinner orders (from Side A Brewing) and MANY on-site drink options: beer, cider, wine, hard seltzers, etc. Family-friendly, respectful and relaxing atmosphere. Treat yourself to a night or two at this mini-vacation destination that you'll never forget!"

The pros – it's unfinished but a treat to see the before and during…we cannot wait to come back again and experience the after. This is going to be a gem in Eastern Oregon.

Stayed one night","Don’t let your first impression ruin your experience here.
Once inside this cute, well equipped basement suite, you will soon forget the difficulty of trying to park while avoiding the neighbors scrap wood pile and that you had to dodge free range chicken manure in the lawn to avoid tracking it into the house (which discouraged us from wanting to use the hot tub).
This cozy and nicely decorated shared space provides everything you will need for your stay. The coffee is great, internet is fast, and the bed is comfortable.
Monica has helpful signs throughout the unit to provide clear instructions including the “watch your head” sign, as the short ceilings may be an issue for taller travelers.
The hosts live upstairs and do their best to keep the expected overhead noise at a minimum for those of us who retire early."

The wifi is strong, we were able to stream while simultaneously studying and working on projects. The space was very clean and fairly private for being a down stairs airbnb. They stuck to the quiet hours and we did not hear much from above after 10 pm. they do have cats that run around but someone put them away for the night and so it didn't keep us awake. the hot tub was private and very nice. there was a mini fridge, air fryer and egg cooker but no microwave which made eating left overs difficult in the morning, but wasn't a big deal overall. the bed was incredibly comfortable and the fresh eggs were a nice touch!"

My husband and I have stayed here before, but I don’t think Monica and Will were home because last night it was really noisy upstairs when we were trying to go to sleep. This was after 10 PM. Also, this morning while I was in the bathroom, I could hear people out side the sliding door, and in our shared space downstairs. This was at 6: 30’ish. Pretty early for a Saturday morning. This hasn’t happened in the past, but it felt invasive. Her husband also came downstairs, and when my husband said something to him he was a bit defensive. This place is not a bargain if the hosts are going to be in your space."

Not having a microwave does not work for me and just about every air B and B have a microwave.
Cat situation is very bad. There is a difference between cat friendly vs i could not even open the door without that cat just taking off outside. Also I do not like them on my bed. I spent an hour chasing them out of my room and finally had to shut the door.
The shower was the best. I have stayed at air b and b all over and this is my first bad review."

Stayed one night","We were passing through the area and needed a place to stay just for a night. Monica & Will’s place was perfect, located centrally, and exactly as described. We are cat people so we were excited to meet their 3 cats. Even if you’re not a cat person, they keep the space very clean and the cats keep to themselves. We were happy Ronald came to say hello though! What a gent! The bed was sooo comfy and the a/c was very nice with the summer heat in full force. Would definitely recommend this cozy space! They’re wonderful hosts!"

Thank you Monica & hubby!! Linda & Curt."

Stayed a few nights","Monica and Will were great hosts, and their unit was very clean and comfortable. I especially appreciated Will's help in carrying my heavy baggage down at check-in and back up at check-out, since I have back pain.
I didn't realize that their unit does not have a microwave, and I suggested they install one. They're cheap, and guests like me like having one to use.
Their neighborhood seems to be more a commercial area, but it was quiet and seemed safe. Their chickens added a rustic touch, without bothering anyone!
I would recommend their unit, if you don't require a microwave."

The room was cozy, the cat was cute, the town was peaceful, what more could you want?
P.S. - if you have a car with a lower bottom, look out driving the road behind the house to park. Major pot holes, just be aware! Still worth the stay though"

I would’ve enjoyed a little more privacy, the husband worked downstairs and would go up and down from the basement (where we were staying) and upstairs. He was very sweet and helpful but him working downstairs was not initially advertised in the original listing i believe. A very clean house with a comfy bed and walk in shower with 3 very sweet cats and chickens outside which we loved. Would recommend and also would’ve liked to have known the husband would be coming in and out."

As I was traveling as a female alone, I was hesitant at first to reserve a room in someone’s home, but the positive reviews I read before booking put me at ease and were very accurate. The space was clean and tidy with many appreciated amenities like a kuerig & creamers, hair dryer & shampoos, and even the special touch of 2 fresh eggs from the hosts’ chickens in the morning which I welcomed and took home to make the next morning! I didn’t get the chance to meet the hosts but our communication through Airbnb and their attention to detail was more than enough to make me very comfortable there."

They were flexible when our arrival timeframe shifted. We arrived to their cozy basement suite and were welcomed with fresh eggs and a very clean space. Before too long we were also greeted by two curious cat friends, which is always a welcome surprise.
We grabbed dinner down the street (like 3 blocks away!) at Side A Brewing, which we definitely recommend. Their place is centrally located in town and very convenient. If you don’t mind potential cat visitors, this is a neat place to stay for a couple nights. I wish we had a little more time to stay and explore the area!"

Loved walking in and seeing the diffuser with essential oils on the counter and a pantry full of basic cooking items that were the same as we keep at our house. The beautiful coordinated decor throughout the house was very welcoming. Sarah answered all my questions promptly and seemed very friendly."

The cupboard had just the right amount of (cute) dishes, even toddler dishes and silverware. the Keurig bar was loaded and the fridge had 2 types of coffee creamers and the water filter pitcher was full. I loved having two bathrooms too. Layout of the house was nice. I especially loved the back entrance having a place to leave bags and shoes, right next to the huge laundry room. The back patio has a gorgeous apple tree too. I've stayed at a remodeled older airbnb and it was musty smelling. Not this house! it even had an air filter running and an essential oil diffuser."

Our beds were super comfy. We even met a neighbor who was super friendly. Another plus was it was on a dead end street in a nice quiet neighborhood. A beautiful sitting place out back under a big apple tree."

Very turnkey accomodations. The location was great for the wedding in Summerville. Sarah was very responsive to my questions. Our only problem was unlocking the front door - it can be a little confusing, but with a little patience we were always able to get in. Super appreciated the washer and dryer and the large bathrooms. The outdoor area was cute - could be a little noisy with the freeway traffic, but nothing a speaker and music couldn't mask. Appreciated all the extra touches like generous shampoo/conditioner/body wash, condiments and of course the coffee bar was most appreciated by both the coffee drinkers and hot cocoa lovers. Thank you for sharing your home!"

The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking every meal which I did, and for a family of 5 it worked out very nicely everyday. Everything was immaculately clean, organized, and she had everything we needed from toiletries to snacks. We will be back to this Airbnb again when we take our annual family ski trip.

Sarah sent a code to enter the place, and instructions were clear. This place has three beautiful rooms and two baths with a large living/dining/kitchen space that allows everyone to be together. There is a utility with washer/dryer/deep sink and everything from kitchen to baths are well stocked with anything you could ever need. The back yard is also well kept, with a BBQ even provided as well as a nice lawn furniture.
Sarah has thought of everything and I wish I could talk her into redecorating MY house! 😍"

Stayed with kids","This is one of the most comfortable places we’ve ever stayed! Sarah was super responsive, even to the littlest concern. She has added charming touches - darling decor, artful touches throughout, & even the dishes & knives reflect her careful choices & eye for style.
The home is SPACIOUS! We had 2 parents & 5 adult children, & we did NOT feel crowded or cramped in the least! We loved the big couch, & especially the gas free-standing stove in the living room! It puts out some heat!!
The beds were super comfy, & bedding was lovely. Lots of extra towels & bedding available.
Soo many extras! Shampoo, toiletries if you’ve forgotten a toothbrush, & even bath salts to soothe sore muscles. The pantry is stocked with Keurig coffees, specialty teas, & enough ingredients to make cookies!
Our only regret was that this was just an overnight stay along our road trip. We’re hoping to come back & enjoy the comforts of Sarah’s home for a few days next time!"

The house itself is decorated so nicely. Peaceful and relaxing. Kitchen had everything we needed plus extra little touches that we hadn't expected. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom had little extras in case we forget anything and the fluffiest of towels!
We had the slightest problem getting into the house but that was because I didn't look through all the check in info properly. When I contacted Sarah for help she answered promptly and got us in. (without once pointing out that she had already sent me the info. Thanks!)
Just a lovely place and one we are hoping to book for other upcoming performances."

Group trip","This airbnb is of exceptional quality and value. Five adults shared a weekend here and we could not have been more pleased with the accommodations. While the neighborhood is not something to write home about, the house is within walking distance from town, which was important to us. The house is exceptional. The vaulted ceiling of the living room (and dining area) gave such a feeling of spaciousness while the fireplace added coziness. The quality of the furnishings is outstanding, and every inch of the house is tastefully decorated; one has the sense that it was a labor of love for Sarah. We came to ski at Anthony Lakes and appreciated that we could store our gear on the back porch out of our way. The kitchen gave a whole new meaning to ""well-stocked""; there is even an ice cream scoop! We lacked for nothing. From bed linens to bathroom rugs, the aesthetics and quality gives one a pampered feel. We loved staying here!"

They had a steamer iron that allowed me to steam her veil hours before she walked down the aisle. The TV with a paid subscription to Netflix, etc. was ideal for my elderly dad to stay entertained! It was super comfortable and we really felt at home! Highly recommend this and might stay again another time! Other members of our family stayed in other rooms down the hall...made it great for all of us to be together!"

Heather's place not only had everything you will need to feel right at home (really appreciated the multiple options for making coffee), but was also super trendy, stylish, and CLEAN. The master suite, including king bed, walk in closet/seating area, and bathroom was on par with a 5 star resort!
Heather's communication was quick, friendly, and very accommodating. The location can not be beat...a couple blocks to downtown, a couple blocks to Eastern Oregon University, and 10 minutes to Morgan Lake.
Fingers crossed I will be able to stay at Heather's place next time I'm in town! Cheers!"
