Stayed a few nights","If you're looking for a place that you fell your the only one a round, this is the place for you. There is really no need to leave the property, spend the day out backbin the wooded yard reading, setting around the fire pit, or even in the hot tub. No better way to spend a day for R and R. The kichen has every thing one could ask for in a kichen. Both bathrooms where very clean and had lots of towels."

Every detail was so well thought out. Sitting in the hot tub with the twinkling lights at night and the humming birds in the morning was probably our favorite part of our entire road trip!"

Stayed a few nights","We had such an amazing stay at the Robin's Nest Cabin. It was full of charm and character and it was in a very peaceful, relaxed setting. We loved the little extra touches, like the labels on doors and drawers in the kitchen. We made use of the nature trail and kayaks and enjoyed the little extras, like the hammock and the yard games. We really had everything we needed to enjoy our stay and we can't wait until we have an opportunity visit the Robin's Nest again."

Hot tub and outdoor area was amazing! So peaceful and relaxing with string lights, fire pit, hammock, hammock chair, swing, picnic table, kayaks, the works!

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Pam’s! We enjoyed the hot tub and all the little touches around the house. The labels on the cabinets were very helpful and we really enjoyed the fire pit and grill. The pac man machine was a nice touch for my husband, haha.
Like a few others have said, the cabin isn’t completely secluded from others but we didn’t see many people around which was nice. The small nature trail behind the house was nice!
If you’re there on a Wednesday there’s a train that passes by right in front of the house (you can literally sit on the porch and watch it) which was super fun! It passes about 815am and then again around 10am.
Pam was extremely responsive and helpful with any questions we had!
Overall, we loved our stay and would visit again!"

Pam is an exceptional host and amazing person who always goes above and beyond to make sure we are welcome and feel at home. This year we actually tried the kayaks out for the first time, and we had a blast! Private, peaceful, relaxing, and absolutely beautiful what more can a person want. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone looking for places to go and escape the day to day life but yet can run into town at a whim....you are right in the middle of everything and it doesnt even feel like it!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was wonderful for our mother daughter weekend. It was great getting in the hot tub, walking the yard, enjoying the train rolling in front of the house in the morning with our cups of coffee. Everything was great! The snacks were such a nice addition especially after a 6.5 hour drive. The primary bathroom was STUNNING. I think my only feedback is more mirrors over all. Getting ready in the mornings between 3 women was a little tricky and it took us until the 2nd day to find the full length mirror in the closet. Truly not a complaint though - we loved every moment of it!"

Stayed with kids","This cabin was well above and beyond 5 stars. Usually I give 5 stars if everything is as expected, and if nothing goes wrong but this very much exceeded expectations (and nothing went wrong). Every single detail was ordered. I loved the bird feeders and bird watching, and the labels on many of the drawers. My son says it’s the best air bnb we’ve ever stayed at. He also loved the labels, hot tub, fireplace, and Galaga. Beds and temperature were comfortable. It was nice to be able to wash clothes there as well. Well done all around to these hosts! Thanks for an amazing stay! Great memories."

Stayed about a week","Our stay at Robin’s Nest was amazing. The description doesn’t do it justice. While it is not totally secluded (neighboring cabin is about 200’ away), as peaceful and quiet as it was made it feel like we were in our own nature preserve. The cabin itself was cozy and comfortable. The fire pit and nature trail were a huge highlight. Sitting on the front porch and listening to the rain falling through the trees was amazing!! We also got the added bonus of seeing a 4 car train go by the cabin!!! Even though the cabin is not in the downtown area, it is still very convenient to everything Hot Springs has to offer."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect honeymoon location for my husband and I! Pam is a great hostess and left us a note and a basket of snacks as well as some water in the fridge. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom very clean and stocked with plenty of towels and toilet paper along with some other toiletries. The kitchen was spotless and Pam has all kinds of cooking utensils and supplies which we made use of during our stay. The outdoor area is beautiful with all the lights and furniture. We unfortunately didn’t get to use the hammock or much of the other outdoor furniture due to a lot of rain while we were there, but we really enjoyed the hot tub and the kayaks. The hostess provides a lot of other amenities such as games, stuff for s’mores, charcoal for grilling, bug spray and citronella for outside use, and bathrobes and slippers. I will say that this has been the best AirBnB that I’ve stayed in! We thoroughly enjoyed everything about the cabin and hope to make a trip back someday!!"

Seemed to be recently renovated and had lots of nice “extras” (snacks, s’mores fixings, nice lighting in the back and around outdoors, stocked bird feeders, bathrobes/disposable slippers, etc). Pam was extremely responsive and helpful. Location isn’t as private as you’d think, and some surrounding properties aren’t as well kept. That being said, Pam’s property itself is very well kept with lots of nice thoughtful touches."

Stayed a few nights","Pam's cabin appears to be new, is extremely clean and is loaded with furnishings and amenities. Check in instructions included a picture of the entrance off the road which was very helpful finding the cabin. We particularly enjoyed the provided board games, vintage Galaga arcade game, fire pit and S'mores fixings.
The primary bedroom is comfortable and the large walk in shower is very nice. The kitchen is fully stocked with cookware and the Keurig coffee maker is a nice touch.
The grounds are very well maintained and peaceful which made our stay even better.
Her cabin is beautiful, clean, and has easy access to Hot Springs, the National Park and Lake Hamilton. The pictures in the listing are accurate but the cabin is not quite as remote as we expected. Pam was quick to respond with our questions and could not have been more helpful. Her cabin is extremely clean, exquisitely furnished and we will definitely book her cabin in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We did an extended weekend stay for a girls weekend and to say this home was exceptional is an understatement. We wanted a woodsy cabin vibe set a bit away from downtown hot springs and that is exactly what we got while also being extremely comfortable.
Pam had so many amazing finishing touches such as snacks, robes, and plenty of information and suggestions about what to do. We went in the winter, so did not get to use the tremendous amount of outdoor activities they have invested in, but still appreciated the option!
Pam herself was extremely responsive and helpful. The beds were so comfortable, everything was spotless and the kitchen had everything you could need. We all agreed we would return to this home over and over again. I personally have never been more satisfied with an Airbnb experience. Book now!!!"

Definitely the most comfortable bed and pillows I’ve experienced at an Airbnb before (in king room- I can’t speak for queen room!) We absolutely loved having a nice open kitchen and living room to all hang out and cook meals in. The hot tub at sunset and after dark was clean and wonderful!!!! We didn’t even get the chance to experience the lake or the fire pit and would’ve been happy to stay far longer! Will not hesitate to book here again if we come back to this area.

We were greeted with a greeting card that said happy anniversary with snacks and champagne. On our bed was robes with slipper. We didn't have to leave the house if we didn't want to. We went fishing we made s'mores by the fire pit, we had a picnic, we sat in the hot tub at night, we had brunch on the deck, we barbecued at night and played games. The house was very clean and the communication was excellent! I REALLY didn't want to leave. My husband kept asking me what was wrong, when we were leaving. We stayed 5 nights and I still wanted to stay longer. The pictures does the house no justice it is absolutely gorgeous. My favorite part was when the outdoor lights came on. Pam is supper sweet and helpful there are books filled with places to eat and things to do. I can't wait to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","Such an amazing property and cabin rental!! My husband and I chose to go to Hot Springs for our 3rd anniversary with my brother and sister-n-law for our couples anniversary trip tradition we started last year(our anniverssaries are close together).
We had looked at this rental several times and saved before deciding to book it, we are so glad we took the step and booked it. Ms. Pam accepted our reservation immediately and began communicating with me about the trip. This was by far the best stay we have had in a long time as couples and as individuals. The cabin is beyond perfect. Clean, well decorated, amazing comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms, and a perfect outside oasis to relax and connect with nature again. We even chose to cancel most of our extracurricular activities such as the casino, amusement park, etc just to stay at the cabin and relax. We grilled and cooked at the cabin which has an open concept living space perfect for interacting. We enjoyed the horseshoes, deck with hot tub, and fire pit most of all. We spent the majoroty of our time outside in these areas, listening to music and relaxing. Ms. Pam communicated with us and was always willing to help us reminding us she was there if we need anything. She is a great host and very tentative to her renters. We could not have asked for anything more at this rental. Thanks to her for an amazing experience and we will definately be back!!! Highly recommend this rental, not enough stars to give!!! Entire experience was perfect and relaxing!!!"

Stayed a few nights","You will love staying at Pam's Nest! Very pleasant, even in the middle of July. The deck was used every day, in the mornings the anticipation of the visiting squirrel along with the hummingbird birds kept our attention while the evenings showcased the ambience of the nest with music and the array of lights that would come on a different times giving a sparkle to the summer nights. It was like a private resort experience."

Stayed a few nights",The cabin is great! It’s very clean and had everything we needed during our stay. An easy drive to downtown and not far from restaurants and a grocery store but it’s tucked far enough away from the noise. We really enjoyed sitting outside on the deck and listening to music through the speakers and looking at the beautiful nature. The kayaks were the perfect addition to the cabin and we had so much fun paddling around. Pam was a great host and communicated all the details and instructions clearly. We would definitely recommend booking this place!

Stayed a few nights","This was a gorgeous place to get away without being in the middle of nowhere! The Robin’s Nest was perfect inside and out. Lovely places to relax outside next to the fire, hammock to enjoy the wildlife as you swing in the breeze, kayaks to paddle out and enjoy the lake, geese, ducks, turtles. . . All with 10 mins of downtown Hot Springs and 15 mins of Northwoods Biking and Hiking Trails. Hot tub and speaker system to play your favorites out back. The accommodations inside were just as cozy! Beautiful and spacious cooking kitchen, new appliances, very clean and well kept. Beds and bedding were comfortable and shower was spacious with a rain water shower head! The host left a wonderful picnic basket with all the s’mores ingredients, as well as having Galaga arcade for the hubby and I to challenge each other!! Everything was thought of!! Pam was a great communicator! We’ll be back!"

The outside accommodations are great from hot tub, fire-pit, grill and kayaks. Unfortunately during our stay it rained a good bit. But that was ok because the cabin is clean and cozy! As well as only about a 10-15 minute drive from all Hot Springs has to offer. We will stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Our whole stay was great! The entire place and the grounds are very clean and well kept. All the small touches Pam provides are perfect. The cabin itself is not as secluded as we expected, as you can see neighbors on each side. However, there’s enough space and trees in between that you barely notice. The sounds of nature and watching all the birds was very peaceful! Our favorite part was the hot tub, it was big, clean and relaxing. Only about 10 mins from historic downtown, shopping, and restaurants. The creek at the very back of the property is cool however, we didn’t get to use it because of the rain; the current was way too strong. From checking it out though, it doesn’t seem like there’s much to do or see off the river bank and it’s not very eye pleasing. All in all our stay was everything we were looking for and we definitely plan to return in the future! 10/10 would recommend if you’re looking for a chill getaway."

The House Rules and Guest Guides tell you everything you need to know about the house and nearby things to do. Pam is very responsive and helpful to questions and inquiries.

Stayed with kids","The cabin is 50 feet from a working railroad track. It can be rather startling but during a 4 day stay only 2 trains went by. That said, the cabin was lovely inside and offered all top of the line amenities. The bed in the master bedroom was really comfortable and the view was really nice. The cameras made it so we didn't really want to relax outside because we felt like we were being checked up on. That or the area wasn't to be trusted. Either way we spend most of the time indoors as a result. The front porch is beautiful though. We would definitely stay again if we were in the area because the inside of the cabin made for a really nice spring break getaway."

The hot tub is luscious with the beautiful trees and the moon peaking through them. The campfire area with the twinkle lights is picturesque - just the right mood lighting and space for a bonding campfire experience. We utilized the kitchen quite a bit for couples cooking time and it was just great! Cooking is a hobby of mine, so I was pleasantly surprised by the fully-equipped kitchen that had all the pans/pots and cooking utensils we needed. Other Air BnBs I’ve been to only had a crummy old cookie sheet or two, this place is decked out with everything and nice brand new stuff. The beds are super comfy, and we utilized that epic shower several times! We will definitely be coming back. Wonderful spot! Pretty easy to get to in our little Honda Civic too, but tucked away enough for some private/woodsy feels too. Thank you for a wonderful stay Pam! You were very quick to respond to any questions we had while we were there too. Great host! Thanks again!"

It’s close enough to everything you need in Hot Springs but away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. We loved that we could easily go out and explore the shops, sites, and restaurants, or stay in and relax in the hot tub, by the firepit, or in the cozy living room. The little touches, like the firewood, picnics basket, bathrobes, and snacks were lovely, and really set this place apart from other rentals. We absolutely recommend this for a getaway and would gladly stay here again if we return to Hot Springs."

Check-in and check-out process were very easy. Mindy and I connected and I explained I was surprising my husband for his birthday, Mindy put out birthday signs and left a plate of scrumptious cookies for us. Vault is a must for dinner and you can’t leave without seeing Garvan Botanical Gardens. If we come back to Hot Springs, this is our spot!

We saw lots of deer which drew my husband to the windows very often.

The views were breathtaking! We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit in the evenings, and the babies loved the swings out front. The big kids enjoyed having their own living room and the assortment of games.
The kitchen was great and stocked with everything we needed to stay in and cook. The bathrooms and bedrooms were beautifully decorated and finished.

Stayed with a pet","If you are looking for peace, serenity, and beautiful views in Hot Springs, AR, you simply cannot find a better home. The Ott House is extremely clean, neat, and orderly. This pet friendly home was so clean you’d never know any pet had been there. The house was extremely clean without a single speck to be found! The host has an amazing heart and provided our family with hands down the best hospitality I have ever experienced! The beautiful views from the mountain peak is breathtaking. So many amenities from an outdoor grill, two tree swings, hammock, bocce ball, games and movies, and even books for kids. This host has something for everyone. The home is spacious and can host two families, as there were 5 of us and could have fit several more people comfortably. Beds were amazing to sleep on and all the furniture was great. Beautifully landscaped yard was serene!"

The hosts have thought of everything and we were greeted with treats and delicious homemade cookies. The beds were super comfortable the the outside space was perfect for hosting. I loved the extra special touch of the book explaining the background of the house and how the hosts brought a dream into fruition. I’d absolutely recommend this house to anyone and we will definitely be coming back"

It is nicely located - tucked far enough away for a quiet, peaceful weekend but close enough to town to enjoy all Hot Springs has to offer. The house was extraordinarily clean and had everything you could possibly need during your stay from snacks and cookies to bandaids and a pizza cutter. Mindy and Jon clearly put a lot of thought into making this Airbnb as welcoming and homey as possible. The Ott House was a critical part in making our stay in Hot Springs wonderful, and we would love to return for another stay!"

Not only were their treats for our furry friend but a box of chocolates with a card wishing us a happy anniversary upon arrival. The house is perfectly located away from the hustle of the town but close enough that you can just hop in the car and go and enjoy things. Masterbath shower is amazing and everything we could have needed was provided. Can't recommend this place enough! Don't hesitate to book this place if its available.

The inside is just as relaxing and peaceful as the outside. With many large windows to enjoy the view, it is very easy to unwind. Whether enjoying a meal at the dining table or sitting on one of the chairs or on the sectional, we were able to completely relax and enjoy our surroundings. And getting into town was very easy and took very little time. If you enjoy the mountains and seclusion, I highly recommend staying here."

We took this mini-vacation to in-plug and destress. We wanted to relax, and just spend time with each other. This was the perfect setting. The house was gorgeous,clean, and had everything we needed, so there was no worrying. The setting was incredible with the sounds of a running stream, views of fog settling over valleys, and just us. With all this long sought after solitude, we were only 5 minutes from bath house row. We walked the Grand Promande, went to museums, rode go karts, and shared the history of the area with our children. We all loved it. The best part was going back to our comfortable “home”, playing games, and just enjoying being a family."

Watching the rain fall on the water was serene and so relaxing. We had a beautiful anniversary weekend. The cabin itself was immaculate and the decor was beautiful. Easy access at check in and using WiFi and up to date amenities with tv in living space and bedroom was an extra bonus! Although you feel secluded it is near so many restaurants and fun activities to enjoy! We loved the autumn vibe and can’t wait to go back for another trip during warmer months to enjoy the water activities! We have already shared pics with family and friends!! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

We had quite a bit of work to do while we were here and the deck was the most amazing “office” ever!
We watched sunrises and sunsets, talked to the geese, watched the turtles play “king of the mountain” on the little stump in the water, and waved to boaters passing by.
The most perfect 4 days we’ve had in a really, really long time.
Thank you so much for letting us visit your little slice of heaven!"

Being literally ""right on the water"" we enjoyed sitting out in the deck watching the sunrise and sunsets, boaters, skiers, wildlife, etc. If we didn't feel like cooking, we were minutes from a huge variety of eateries. The lake house was stylishly furnished and had all the amenities as listed on Airbnb plus some extras - coffee maker, small portable outdoor grill with charcoal. Our host was even generous enough to surprise us with several ""extras"" to make it more special. When I had any questions, Ethan was prompt in responding. We may have to make this an annual tradition. Would definitely do this again! Thank you for a great 1st time Airbnb experience!"

My husband & I enjoyed our coffee each morning sitting in the Adirondack chairs on the wrap around porch listening to the beautiful birds sing. Our party of 8 took full advantage of the amazing amenities outside and fit very comfortably inside. We cooked, grilled or baked every meal during our 4 night stay…the kitchen was graciously stocked with everything we needed. The game room was such an awesome space for both the young and old. As expected with any Overnight Digs rental, the home was beautifully decorated, very comfortable and exceptionally clean. Right when you walk on to the property, you can tell a lot of thought and work went into every single detail of this amazing rental. Our family banked a lot of great memories…thank you!!"

The location is only 10 mins away from town. We loved that is was right on the lake. The views are spectacular! We loved that they offered a Canoe and Kayak. We will definitely be back!!

We immediately walked over to the windows to look at the view of the lake.....WOW!! Every day, we would notice another detail of the home. Then...I have to mention the canoe and the firepit! We relaxed every day out by the lake and took the canoe out once and had a blast! We ate a local restaurant down the street called ""Mr. Whiskers"" for catfish and it was SO good!! The host was so great to work with as well! Every detail was thought out.
We can't wait to come back!!!"

Perfectly out of town to not be inundated with traffic and only 10 - 15 minutes away from Bathhouse Row and the shops. Josh welcomed us with texts before and checked on us during and after our visit.

Stayed a few nights","All I can say is Wow! This home is absolutely stunning. You will feel right at home enveloped by luxury & beauty. The home is beautifully appointed with high end amenities; the chef’s kitchen is to die for; the bedrooms are large with really comfortable bedding & linens. The bathrooms are a work of art, you must take a break & bathe in the slipper tub complete with handmade soap & a bath bomb. We enjoyed spending our mornings in the sun room drinking coffee & looking out at the lake; in the afternoon the binoculars allowed us to look at the birds & wildlife. There were two different patios to further enjoy the outdoors. Oh, you can’t overlook the Cedar hot tub-an amazing experience! I hesitated to share this review because I’d like to keep this place a secret (selfishly) but seeing how the owners put their heart and soul into assuring their guests had absolutely everything they needed, I knew how important it was to give recognition where it’s due. 5+++ stars here!"

Stayed a few nights","The Treetops Hideaway was a total luxury! From the bedding to the dishes to the amazing view of the sunrise on the lake from the reading nook, we were in heaven! This newly built home has left no stone unturned. The care given to every detail, including the art on the walls made us feel like we had gone away on a vacation to a high end retreat. The lake water was down, but it didn't disrupt our view of watching the cranes and ducks fly over the water as we drank our morning coffee from the deck. The cedar hot tub was such a treat, the fragrance of the water was therapy!! It was a perfect place for 2 couples, we each had our privacy as well a beautiful kitchen, deck and living room to share. We were on a winter getaway with friends so it was great to be close to Garvan Woodland Gardens, Oaklawn Racetrack and downtown fine dining which we enjoyed all of! We will definitely return for a refreshing get away! Thank you Josh for your excellent hosting!"

We stayed in the Quapaw dome and it was everything the listing and pictures said it would be, except we didn’t realize how much fun it would be. The corner hot tub was so much fun, the kitchen and bathroom were super nice. The place was clean and felt so cozy. There’s nothing like laying in the bed and looking out of the domes window to see the peaceful wooded surroundings. The location is so serene and is just a short drive to downtown Hot Springs!

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I spent our anniversary here. Words can’t express how wonderful our experience was. From booking, checking in, all the way to our actual stay our host kept us in the loop and made us feel right at home.
The drive up was easy and beautiful. The dome itself was cozy and a neat get-away. Overall, I would say this is the spot to stay. You are only minutes away from bathhouse row and the national park. Lots to see and do with great food. Our host also supplied great recommendations for food, activities, and things to see.
Things to note is:
1) there isn’t a “fire pit” but there is a propane grill.
2) at night if you hear a “popping” sound it’s just the acorns falling onto the dome top lol nothing to worry about and hardly noticeable
We definitely will be back!"

The live band below the loft at the Ohio Club was pretty cool and not bothersome at all. Within walking distance from several shops, activities and restaurants. I parked in the parking deck without issue and we were able to walk everywhere. I recommend this loft and we look forward to returning in the near future."

Stayed a few nights","This location was really great. right across from bathhouse row ( you can see it from the window), close to restaurants, shops, that hot springs park and trails, etc. It has a ton of character and the owners really spent a lot of time decorating it to reflect the history and explanations on the decor and its relation. Very tastefully decorated and as modern as possible in a historical building. I would highly recommend it to anyone in the hot sprigs area.
One point though that I didn't realize is that parking is not included in the AirBNB. There is a free parking garage about a half mile from the location though so it ended up being quite convenient. The garage is also covered so it was nice when bad weather came in."

Sitting in living room watching people down below at the bathhouses. Easy to get around on foot. Did not see the car again until I left. The food downstairs at the Ohio Club is tasty. It felt exclusive to go up our private staircase next to a happening place. I would stay here again."

Only side note I’d leave someone is that it’s directly above the Ohio Club bar and they have loud music going until 1am each night so probably not ideal if you go to bed early. We’re night owls so it didn’t bother us much. I definitely want to come back! 🙂

Stayed one night","The Waterfront Paradise is THE cleanest and nicest short term stay I have ever been in. The photos show the actual unit and they are absolutely true. It smelled great, was stocked with all our our needs and everything was very comfy and cozy. The only bad thing was that we didn't get to stay longer. Amy was great at communicating and answering any questions I had. They had great recommendations for local eats and info about so many things to do in Hot Springs. We would absolutely stay again and next time for several days. This was a great stay."

We stayed here as a celebration of 22 years of marriage and we both absolutely loved every minute. We hated to say goodbye. I would highly recommend Amy's place as a 5 star stay for anyone looking for a quiet place to relax and hangout.

Beautiful condo and surroundings, so peaceful sitting on the porch watching the rain. Thoroughly enjoyed the coffee bar area set up and the nice goodies on arrival were a lovely touch. Everything in the condo was clean and comfortable, the bed was amazing, very cosy and homely, we didn’t want to leave! The TVs had excellent channels - very grateful for the sports so we could watch the F1 ! The condo had wonderful amenities, everything you could want and more. Communication was brilliant, easy instructions to follow. We had an amazing time and i would highly recommend this place to others, and i hope to be back someday! Many thanks"

Stayed one night","Amy's ""Waterfront Paradise"" was exactly that. It was the most beautifully peaceful setting for a much-needed respite. The condo is impeccably furnished with so many unique and special touches. I especially loved the ""Sweet Treats"". It is a super clean space with soft and comfy linens and a king size bed. A nice, pleasant breeze came in off the water while I sat on the porch enjoying natures' symphony of sounds, and when the sun was ready to set, I had easy access to the walking path around the lakefront for multiple viewpoints. The sunrise meets you with your first cup of coffee either from the expansive windows or wrapped in a blanket back on the porch. My only issue was I couldn't stay longer. If you're looking for a quiet, refreshing getaway, look no further."

Stayed one night","Mother day has always been a hard day for my fiancé with her losing her mom at a young age. Normally she just wants to hangout at the house and really not celebrate it, but this year at the last minute she wanted to go away with just me, her and our daughter and be by the lake or pool as I cook her favorite meal. And Amy’s place gave us all that and more. The lake was right in the back yard and had a pool to the left of us. Everything was super clean and well put together. This is the perfect place to go if you want to have a romantic weekend with someone special. The sunset on the lake is amazing and it is right in the backyard. This year we have made a promise to our selfs, to have at least one weekend together out of every month away from everyone else and Amy’s place is a place we will revisit. Trust me, book now cause I don’t see Amy’s place being at this price for too long.."

We lazed about in the mornings (coffee in the hot tub!) and spent the afternoons hiking and exploring downtown Hot Springs. We squeezed some services at the Quapaw spa had a delicious lunch at Superior Bathhouse among other things. We ended up returning to Cheryl’s nest in the evenings for snacks instead of dining out because the location was just so fabulous and inviting. I will definitely return at some point for another stay.

Stayed a few nights","This was probably the most unique and interesting AirBnB in which we have ever stayed. Very cool interior and lots of privacy on the porch/balcony.
The inside of the “tent” has great insulation and kept us warm even in freezing temps. The sound insulation (hearing noises inside coming from outside, and vise versa) is not like a typical home, but that had little effect on our stay.
The drive into Hot Springs is very short (about 20 min max) and we did it multiple times a day with ease. Great location close to town but far enough away for seclusion.
We loved The Nest and would certainly stay here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I stayed at The Nest for his birthday, and we both thought the house was beautiful and comfortable. It is close to other houses but we felt like we had privacy. I loved the soaking tub, the bed was perfect, and the tent roof makes the place feel extra cozy. In spite of cold temperatures (30s-40s) it was plenty warm inside. The only downside to the stay was that there was loud construction next door that began around 8am each morning. Cheryl was responsive and apologetic about the situation, which was not in her control, but I would have opted to change locations had I been given the choice. She offered a small refund (about 8% of the total cost of the booking) but it was a disappointment after reading all the reviews stating how relaxing and peaceful it was for others. So overall I loved it, but only at night."

Stayed a few nights","We were delighted when we arrived at The Nest. It was just like the photos. The deck area had a few spiderwebs and debris around, but we found a leaf blower and broom and were able to clean it off pretty easily. The inside was pristine. Light and bright and beautifully decorated. Well appointed kitchen and bath. The bed was super comfy and the deck, sitting area, and hot tub were such a nice treat. The only issue we encountered (which was completely out of the owners control) was that a tree service decided to come and shred limbs out side on the street for a few hours, rather early Monday morning, so our morning was not as peaceful and serene as it could’ve been. And tent walls are not super insulated, so we heard everything! But by around 10:30 or 11, it was peaceful once again and we were able to sit outside and enjoy our beautiful surroundings. This place is beautiful- I’ll bet the color change in the fall is spectacular!"

Stayed a few nights","Hot Springs is so much fun and a fall weekend getaway here is a great idea.
This tent is as nice as it looks in the pictures. And it’s in a picturesque setting in the woods. Private. Exclusive. Beautiful. They did not spare any expense constructing this property. Only the best was used from the linens to the toilet - pretty amazing!
I had a few questions and found the responses helpful and friendly."

Had a small hiccup on arrival that was promptly and appropriately handled, basically no issue whatsoever. Bed is super comfortable, loved the outdoor shower and hot tub and personally spent a few hours in the inside tub reading and relaxing. We had a really wonderful stay, if we ever find ourselves out in Hot Springs again would rebook without hesitation"

It was exactly what we were looking for and gave us a fantastic couples getaway! The bathroom was so nice and romantic, I also can not say enough about how cozy the bed was! We didn’t want to get out of the bed. There is so many things to do and you are only 20 mins or less away from everything! Was so easy to get around and we loved being close to the lake and being able to hear and see the boats. We loved every minute and will definitely be staying here again."

Stayed a few nights","I have to say the pictures set me up for something bigger and more lovely. The house rules are EXTENSIVE, including packing out your own trash. I didn't see this in the house rules and paid another $25. So on top of a $75 cleaning fee, and $289.41 service fee, and a rate of $395 per night - I still was supposed to empty the trash bins for a 5 day stay. For a total of $2,544.41, I would never had expected an owner to contact me for more money because I left three bags of trash neatly in the kitchen. This was also identified as ""damage"" to her home in the request for more money. The kitchen is poorly stocked for home cooking for a week. The bed is lumpy and too large for the space. The tub (no shower inside) is uncomfortable for a daily wash. The inside space was cramped. One dish towel to dry dishes for a week. I have stayed in Airbnbs around the world, and this just didn't match up to expectation. For the rate, I would neither stay again nor recommend."

Stayed a few nights","We were very excited about staying at the Nest. The tent was such a unique experience, and everything was very high end. However, our stay wasn’t exactly as expected. The front door and windows have no way to cover them for privacy. When contacted, the property manager stated that no one could see in, but the door overlooks two other houses that can see into the tent as well. Hot tub maintenance came on a day other than what the listing stated, interrupting our morning. We returned for the evening to use the hot tub but were not able to enjoy it because it was not restarted after maintenance. All of this left us disappointed since we paid a premium price for what we expected to be a premium stay. After our stay, we reached out to Cheryl. She was very responsive, refunded us for part of our stay, and said she would correct some of these issues. Hopefully that makes it a better place for future visitors."

Stayed with kids","Overall it ended up being a relaxing couple of days.
Pros: Neat house, very unique, loved the hot tub and super high tech toilet. Saw owls, song birds, and lots of deer. The location is peaceful and quiet. The patio in the rain was heaven. Robes were great, beds comfortable, the lighting is fantastic, and the fairy garden was a cute addition my daughter loved.
Cons: the outdoor shower was broken and we had no prior notice (a huge selling point for my daughter). There’s no stove top which is advertised, but the grill top was a disgusting mess and there was no scrubbing brush or cleaner for the stove. I called Cheryl and Kenny and they sent a cleaning team over. Cheryl was rude when I brought these things to her attention and got short with me. The bathtub (our only means to bathe) had a small hot water heater and ran out quickly. Lastly, I felt very uneasy in a cloth house with easy access on the west side and just below the balcony. Ultimately. I felt exposed."

Stayed a few nights","Pros: The location was great. Everything was clean and nice. It was romantic and we had a wonderful anniversary there. It was well stocked and the jacuzzi was nice even though it was cold outside. We found some
nice places to eat and it wasnt too far off the beaten path that the drive into town was long.
The property manager is extremely responsive. We had a small issue and he responded within minutes.
Cons: Because it’s a tent, expect outside noises to carry. Think leaf blowers, birds, basically any noise from outside. The location was secluded so this wasn’t too bad but the neighbors are really into leaf blowing. Lol.
The glass doors let in light and it’s a little disconcerting when sleeping at night because they aren’t covered. But the locked entryway into the deck made us feel safer.
Lastly, it's a small thing but the floors arent even.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and have recommended The Nest to friends."

Stayed a few nights","I surprised my wife with a 3-day getaway to the Nest for her birthday. As we walked through the first door, she was excited and impressed taking in the view. As we entered the door to the tent she was even more impressed. Everything about the Nest was top notch. We enjoyed the hot tub, the outdoor shower, the bidet, the bathtub, and the bed. I thought we would be able to use our personal dish network account but that was not the case. The privacy and seclusion is what we needed for this getaway. You can hear everything going on around you. Great experience. The only negative was we needed extra towels and it took all day to get those. I would also recommend the cleaning crew pay more attention to details. My wife fell in love with the Nest and enjoyed her birthday experience. I highly recommend The Nest to any love birds needing to get away for a few days to rest, relax, and rekindle the flames."

Stayed a few nights","Overall the stay at The Nest was a great experience. It is very private, charming, and a nice retreat from the busyness of life. Great sitting areas outside, hot tub was wonderful! Bed was comfortable and entire property made you feel relaxed! The main issue we had with the experience was the lack of or unclear communication about certain amenities and how to use them. We had to have the tub fixed because the drain would not seal correctly which made it very difficult to bathe, the property manager never reached back out to us let us know if the issue was resolved or not. Could use some updated cookware but overall.. kitchen was stocked pretty good. The checkout checklist is hard to find.. would be nice to have some laminated notes in the room to help with those details and also possible solutions to common issues like wifi problems, how to use the TV’s, etc. I would definitely recommend this property to others and will probably book again."

We even got engaged on the deck at The Nest. The trip was a much needed getaway. You won’t be disappointed with your stay!

It is absolutely a unique experience, and while there is so much to do in Hot Springs, you don't want to leave the Nest for any of it! The bed feels like sleeping on clouds, all the decor makes such a dreamy environment, and the privacy makes you feel like you have left reality and escaped to the dreamiest fairytale woods. I can't recommend this place enough, and I can't wait to return someday!"

Hot Springs is actually an adorable bustling little town with amazing views as well! Our favorite part was the fact that when it stormed (and it STORMED), we felt completely safe/secure while feeling like we were in the heart of the storm. A unique experience for sure. The hot tub was obviously amazing as well :) On top of that, Cheryl responded to my late night text asking for the code since we took off way later than planned, which we are beyond grateful for. 10/10 would come again!!!"

We soaked up the magic of nature while soaking in the hot tub morning, noon, and night. We watched the sunrise from a perfectly silent hot tub and listened to the birds wake up. The location is exceptional if you want to stock up on hot springs water or visit bath row. We will be back for sure, maybe even a yearly trip might be in our future. Thank you so much for creating this magical oasis Cheryl. We are so grateful!"

Stayed a few nights","Only issue was with the hot tub. We arrived and almost immediately removed the hot tub cover to get it ready for us to sit and relax. The hot tub was very cloudy with a lot of debris, no big deal there’s a skimmer net and some spray to add if it’s too foamy. We cleaned and cleaned, decided to just get in and see how it felt, we REMOVED the floating chlorine so we could enjoy the jets and because the chemical smell was so strong it burned your eyes. We got in, did not enjoy the cloudy and vert foamy water (tried the spray) that didn’t work, so we got out and covered it back up. Next morning hot tub guy comes by to service the tub, we sat outside and talked with him about leaving the floater out and that the water is super cloudy and foamy. He informed us the chemical levels were okay and we could leave the chlorine floater out but make sure to put it in before we leave. Even after the cleaning and service from him the water was still not clear at all and we decided we just wouldn’t use it again, no big deal. We check out, get home, and I get a request to pay for the draining of the hot tub because we left the chlorine out; which we replaced it before we left like the hot tub maintenance man instructed. If we had known that we would get a $175 draining fee only because we left the floater out, I would not let it out and if I had known it was really that big of a deal I wouldn’t go against what is asked knowingly. I try to be respectful of other people and their property. The hot tub is not drained after each guest, which I do find a bit off putting, all the other cabins with hot tubs have always drained after each guest and you can definitely tell the difference. Fee paid, because I’ll pay it forward to the next guest, you’ll have a clean hot tub."

A foggy morning was just as beautiful as a sunny one. The home was spotless and cozy easy to find and felt extremely intimate. If you enjoy wild life birds are always viewable as well as a squirrwl who lives nearby, and wandering white tail deer.

Had issues getting the water to heat up, warmest shower in the 3 days was 111 degrees according to the water heater, and with the extremely light pressure was hardly warm.

Brittany was also very thoughtful in providing some extras for our anniversary. The cabin is roughly a 15min drive to the main attractions and food in Hot Springs. Cell signal was very good for us while staying (Verizon). I highly recommend staying here!

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed here for a short honeymoon. The house has a great view, convenient location and is decorated nicely. However the amenities were not accurate. The listing said all of the basic kitchen items were provided but they were not. There was not a spatula, salt, whisk or oven. There was a convection microwave. The listing said it had a hair dryer, iron and Wi-Fi which it didn’t. The water heater worked some times, but on the cold mornings it would only get warm at best. Also the heaters couldn’t keep the cabin warm."

Pastries and other goodies were a nice touch!!!
Otherwise, an excellent stay and will definitely consider again if we travel to the area. Thanks Brittany!"

Granted one of those issues was my fault and does not reflect upon Brittany and this house. It gave us an opportunity to try more local restaurants."

Stayed a few nights","The Bluebird House at The Covey was the perfect getaway for my husband and me. The tent is beautifully decorated, well-appointed, and every detail thoughtfully planned. We had everything we needed for a relaxing few days - lovely and comfortable interior, the deck overlooking the lake with a hot tub, and a fire pit. We especially liked the outdoor pizza oven with ingredients ready to go in the fridge. We were the only guests on the property during our stay which made it seem as if we were more secluded than we were since the tent is just a few minutes from restaurants and shopping. One drawback was the noisy road that was quite busy most of the day, however, this wouldn't keep me from returning. The other issue was no wifi. Cheryl made EVERY effort to get it up and running and kept us updated with each step she took to resolve the issue. Little did we know that there was a nationwide AT&T outage, which was completely out of her control, but that didn't stop her from trying!"

The design of the cabin allows for complete privacy and seclusion. The appliances, bed, sound system, bidet, fire pits, soaking tub, and hot tub allow for a 5 star experience. Our first night there, it rained through the night and the sound of the rain on the tent allowed for the feeling of primitive camping all while enjoying a very luxurious space. Cannot say enough positive things about this space. You will absolutely fall in love."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at this Airbnb was a remarkable journey into both luxury and adventure. The tent itself was a splendid blend of rustic charm and high-end comfort, striking a perfect balance between a safari tent experience and a luxurious retreat.
The furnishings inside the tent were thoughtfully chosen, exuding a sense of elegance while staying true to the theme. Every detail, from the plush bedding to the tasteful decor, contributed to an atmosphere of sophisticated wilderness.
But the real gem of this experience was the hot tub. It was like finding an unexpected haven of relaxation in the midst of the wild, offering a serene spot to unwind under the starlit sky. This feature, along with the host’s dedication to providing a 5-star experience, made my stay exceptionally memorable. I highly recommend as it’s more than just a place to stay; it’s an adventure waiting to be lived."

The Bluebird house was just as incredible in person as it was in the photos. It felt like a home retreat away from home with so many bells and whistles giving you that extra experience of being pampered. It was so nice that I didn’t want to leave. The few times I had a question it was taken care of or immediately answered. The property grounds are very well taken care of and everything was nicely cleaned and we look forward to future visits here. My man who is the owner of Gizmo Electrics LLC a great and honest company based in Aubrey Texas and branching out to many other areas of course took note of the electrical work and enjoyed all the nice detailed lighting. He has a few suggestions if you welcome them Cheryl.? We very much enjoyed our comfortable getaway stay in the Bluebird house and very highly recommend as you will not be disappointed if you stay here.
So much appreciated,

Stayed a few nights","It is a beautiful place with a significant cool factor with the tent aspect. Very comfortable bed, exquisite kitchen and bathroom. The hot tub was great! Younger disrespectful renters in the cabin that sits higher up the hill than the bluebird house was the only negative and out of the host's control. They let their dogs out without watching, which wound up at our location, relieved themselves on the patio, and acted aggressively towards us and our dog. One concern would be the sight line from the upper tent to the bluebird house. The hot tub has a shade obstructing street views, but no such shade obstructed the view from the upper cabin. With this area sharing the only “traditional shower” on the premises, it was awkward. Overall, though, the property was beautiful, and we had a great experience provided by the host. I would recommend it!"

Pros: the most comfortable bed ever! A dreamy bathtub with a lovely view. A smart toilet that had a delightful heated seat. Convenient location to local restaurants.
Cons: it wasn’t as secluded as I thought it was going to be and the busy road could be noisy at times. The hot tub would only reach 99-100 degrees and to us it would have been ideal at around 104. The sofa was pretty but not very comfortable at all.
Overall, it was a lovely weekend doing a bunch of nothing which is exactly what we planned. We would stay here again! Thank you, Cheryl!"

This place was cozy and the views were unreal. I just can’t say enough wonderful things about the Covey. We will most definitely be back.

Stayed a few nights","I will never stay anywhere else in Hot springs. This was the most adorable air B&B, with the best decore and seriously comfortable beds. Princess Leo is such a cuddle bug and made me miss my beloved cats! I seriously contemplated asking if I could take her home!
Madison is a very communicative host with amazing recommendations, she arranged for a tarot reader to come to the house and has excellent restaurant suggestions.
The location can litterally not be beat, it's walking distance to everything in the national park and just slightly off the main street so it's quiet. We loved sitting on the porch or balcony enjoying a bevragino nightly and just basking in the beauty of the area.
I will say this may not be the best spot for individuals with major mobility issues as it's on a hill and has steep stairs, but other than that it's the perfect Air B&B for small groups.
I wish I could give it 10 stars!"

From the moment I stepped inside, I was enchanted by the eclectic decorative style, which exuded a bold, burlesque feminine energy. Every corner of the house was a visual delight, with unique touches and surprises waiting to be discovered.
We rented this charming house for our honeymoon and it was the perfect setting for a romantic getaway. We felt so grateful to have such a lovely place to call home for a few days.
The owner was warm and super helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed. And then, of course, there was Leo - the loveliest, most affectionate cat I've ever met! She was our constant companion, always happy to cuddle and chat (yes, she's quite the talkative feline!).
If you're looking for a place to stay that's full of character, charm, and warmth, I highly recommend Miss Fancy's in Hot Springs. It's a true gem!"

Stayed one night","We booked this house for my daughters, sweet 16th birthday.￼ Our host was very prompt with answering questions. The house was the most gorgeous Airbnb. I think I’ve ever stayed in. The decor was divine. Even her little kitty that lives there was so sweet and cute. The location was perfect for walking downtown, restaurants, and shopping. Checking in and out was a breeze. ￼￼￼It’s the perfect spot for a couple’s getaway.
￼We frequent Hot Springs and plan on looking up this house first, every time we come. Unique, sexy, sultry, calming, vintage, impressive to say the least! We loved it!"

Stayed a few nights","Miss Fancy was undoubtedly one of my favorite stays ever and I do mean that! As soon as you pull in to the driveway you’re greeted with the most stunningly designed front yard, and beautiful Miss Fancy looming over Hot Springs in all her glory. As you walk in, miss Leo greets you at the door like she’s been expecting you her whole life, and the entire time she is glued to you like you are her long lost best friend. She will run ahead of you to give you the cutest tour, where you’ll soon see yourself surrounded by the most gorgeous decor and stunning vintage furniture you’ve ever seen. This place is absolute magic, and it is so close to everything you need in Hot Springs that you can slip your shoes on and head out by foot, or, after seeing and feeling the magic of Miss Fancy, plans could change and you may just end up wanting to stay in your entire stay. ❤️ thank you Madison, Leo and Miss Fancy for making my 29th birthday the best one ever! 💕"

We like to try something new each visit, and this time we enjoyed Rolando’s restaurant and open mic/poetry night at Kollective Coffee and Tea, which impressively is the longest continuously running open mic/poetry night in the country.

In addition to the home being beautiful inside and out, it is also close to everything (just a block or so off of Central Ave). This makes a lot of the tourist stuff of Hot Springs really easy to get to. The home is is very peaceful and private despite the close proximity to a busy area. Coffee on the upstairs porch in the morning is something not to be missed. The house has everything that you could possibly need during your stay and then some. Madison is a wonderful host, and she has clearly put a great deal of thought and care into everything in the home. This is THE place to stay if you are going to Hot Springs.
Also Princess Leo the cat is a great snuggler who will make sure you feel welcome."

Our 3 days in Hot Springs, I think we only took the car out once. There is so much to do within walking distance. Princess Leo, the house cat, is the absolute sweetest animal ever and made us miss our pets that much less. One word of advice, if you have a car with low clearance like mine, is to maybe consider street parking on the other side of the driveway, as the driveway is quite steep compared to the street. Aside from that, we would definitely stay here again on another trip to Hot Springs. Highly recommend."

The whole place was clearly put together with passion and true care! There were such cute trinkets and historical touches to the house.
The listing was accurate in my opinion! There’s a first bedroom off the staircase landing at the top of the stairs, which hosts a day-bed type bed and an arrangement of super cool vintage boudoir clothing. The other bedroom features all sorts of wall pictures and a queen-sized bed.
The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, the house warmed before my arrival, and, the best part, Princess Leo, Madison’s cat, around for my stay! We cuddled literally the whole time.
Hope to come back again!"

The location looks right over the bathhouses and main strip -- no wonder it's been so many things in its history because it's a gorgeous building and it's right near the sights. It abuts a park and you can feel some of the naturalness and rest just by stepping out the back door.
Princess Leo is the kindest host you could ask for, and the decorations put you right into the feel of a boudoir. No complaints and we'd love to stay here again."

Classy & seductive with that touch of history you love to see! My boyfriend had such a fun time looking at everything in the house! I super enjoyed the chilling mornings on the huge wrap around porch. The house cat Leo is such an old soul. Her meows are sometimes question like and she likes to be fed in the morning. She also cuddled with me at night. I’d definitely stay here again!

We opened the door at 11pm and there sat Princess Leo, greeting us immediately with a groggy ""meeoooow"". The place is so funky and fun - it really lifted our spirits! Madison was super responsive, even at 11pm when we weren't sure our transit van would fit in the parking area. (It did!) We had no idea the house was just a stones throw from Hot Springs National Park, which is also well worth learning about and exploring! The whole experience at Miss Fancy and the surrounding small town was incredibly positive, we are already planning a trip back! Thank you for sharing this space!"

The level of detail in the décor, multiple wrap around porches, outdoor gardens on the side of the mountain, really amazing. When you consider the size of the house, how many adults can sleep there, the full kitchen, two full bathrooms, and everything else, Miss Fancy is the best deal in Hot Springs. Located half a block or so off the middle of the main strip of restaurants, bars, stores, bath houses in downtown Hot Springs, the location couldn't be better."

Stayed a few nights","This space is so unique, me and my husband took an hour one of the days to just look at all the decor and the thoughtfulness that went into creating that feel. Madison was so helpful and responsive with questions we had. I’ve already recommended this house to friends!"

Stayed one night",This place was amazing. We loved it a only regret not staying longer. We will be back and it will be longer. Location is perfect. Back far enough to be quiet from the Main Street hustle and bustle but So close you feel bad if you DONT walk. It’s a special place and we felt at home. Would stay again. Will stay again. Am going to recommend to everyone. Thank you

Stayed one night",By far my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in! The Decour and finishing touches are true to the time period of the home as well as lots of extras to boost a little fun! Only a couple of blocks to the main strip of restaurants shops and bars. The jacuzzi tub is a great perk too! There’s a wonderful outdoor space and full kitchen. We will definitely be staying here during our next trip to hot springs! 10/10

Stayed one night",Lovely historic house filled with antique decorations. Located steps away from everything! Very cozy and comfortable. She is a photographer so every corner looks ready for you to pose in! Very feminine decor and many beautiful details. Enjoyed a cup of tea on the front porch. Huge beautiful tub. We were able to relax and enjoy our visit. We’ll be back!

Stayed one night","If you find yourself in Hot Springs, STAY HERE!! My husband and I stayed here for a night as we were passing through from Texas to Tennessee. The home is a historic Victorian with so much burlesque charm. I could have stayed in the house our whole visit just looking at all of the antiques and decor. You couldn't ask for a better location to Bathhouse Row with Miss Fancy being only about a block away from the Row as well as dining and shopping. Madison was an awesome host! Although we never needed to contact her, she gave us all of her info before our arrival just in case. I will definitely plan on coming back for a girls trip!"
