Stayed a few nights","This charming home with several well appointed rooms was the perfect stay for us. The location couldn't have been better, the Belle Epoque room was perfect for out two night stay - the bed was very comfortable, the tub a welcome sight at the end of a long day, shower was also great. We were surprised with the continental breakfast that Barbara and Steve provided in the kitchen next to our room. Such a generous offering of coffee, teas, muffins, English muffins, yogurt, etc. We were researching our own family history in addition to US history. Barbara actually knew some of the family members! She also put us in touch with the cemetery manager who helped us navigate Evergreen Cemetery more easily. Both she and Steve were extremely accommodating upon our arrival and during our stay. We will be back - hopefully in November for the reenactment of the Gettysburg address! Thank you so much for your help, Barbara."

Stayed a few nights","This is a stand out Airbnb property in Gettysburg, perfectly positioned to visit the battlefields, the museums, and also walk up Baltimore Street into the Square and visit the shops and bars too. The property is tastefully decorated in Word War II decor, the bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms are comfortable, and the pantry / kitchen is generously stocked with an amazing array of breakfast goods and snacks for guests to enjoy.
The hosts Barbara and Steve are very welcoming personable engaging and nothing is too much trouble for them. They gave us a lot of very useful local information to help make our stay more effective and pleasant. Their communication was extremely efficient and effective.
We thoroughly recommend this sit it is a really nice boutique hotel with truly fabulous hosts."

Perfect for a quiet getaway. The location is amazing and the entire town is just steps away for dining, drinks and shops. Barbara and Tom were so friendly and hospitable.
A beautiful continental breakfast was available with fresh bagels and danishes, yogurts, coffee and tea, juices and snacks.
Added bonus: access to Roku and we discovered that the movie ""Gettysburg"" was made available. That was a fun discovery because we really wanted to watch after touring the battlefields.
Do not miss this gem!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Sentimental Journey was a perfect choice for visiting Gettysburg. The Beautiful Dreamer room was like going back in time. The room was large with it's own entrance, a kitchenette, a nice lanai, and a claw foot bath with a shower. Having the Cone Sweet Cone right on site was a treat. We sat out on the lawn and watched the firebugs. What fun that was! It is on the main street so everything is in walking distance. You will love a Sentimental Journey with it's 24 hour ""cafe"" with all sorts of treats that they supply. BUT reserve the Beautiful Dreamer if you want privacy and don't do stairs."

The location was perfect; we basically parked in the reserved B&B parking and then never got back in our car - it was so easy to walk everywhere we’d want to eat and shop! The room itself was so cozy and clean. The breakfast room was super well stocked with easy to grab breakfast items. And, of course, or host was so kind and helpful! Next time we’re in Gettysburg, this is where we’ll stay."

The pictures shown on the listing are exactly as described. I loved the 24/7 open kitchen! We could go in there anytime day or night for coffee, juice, fruit, snacks of any kind, many choices of cereal etc. The kitchen area was also very clean. The house in right in the center of town which makes it easy to walk to many places. I do encourage you to check out the visitors center, it was absolutely amazing. Also they have a driving audio tour which is 24 miles long, takes you to 16 stops along the way and last about 3 hours, all totally free. I highly recommended this area and it's accomodations."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed a few days over Memorial Day weekend for my boyfriends birthday. The location could not be better. It’s walking distance to absolutely everything. There was a Memorial Day parade and the route went right by the B&B, it was awesome. Not to mention right next door is their icecream shop with amazing icecream. That’s where you check in, at cone sweet cone. Barbra’s husband I believe it was checked us in and gave us a lot of great info since it was our first time in Gettysburg. The B&B itself was really decorated well and you could just feel the history in the home. It was a full house but everything was nice and quiet. Gettysburg is one of the most dog friendly places I have ever visited which is so awesome. Restaurants even have a dog menu! Barbra and her husband even have a walk up window to their icecream shop so you can walk up with your dog, so cute. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay and Gettysburg has become a new favorite place to visit I think:)"

I slept well on a comfy bed. Several restaurants are within a few blocks — including a brew pub and a great noodle house. The owners of the b&b were very sweet, and I loved their 24 hour kitchen with all sorts of snacks and breakfast food. ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","The B&B is in the historic downtown area and easily walkable to many stores, restaurants etc. the Farnsworth is two doors down and the Dobbins House is about 2 blocks. We also ate at O’Rorkes. There is an ice cream store right next door! The check in / check out was easy. The 24-hour breakfast room was nice and well stocked with lots of choices. We stayed in the beautiful dreamer suite that is on the downstairs level. It has its own separate entrance and a small kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator and table/chairs. Also an enclosed porch off of the back and large bathroom with claw foot tub. It is somewhat of a dark space and doesn’t get a lot of light. Also, One can hear the other guests walking around and moving luggage etc upstairs at an amplified level. The street noise is also very loud. If you are a light sleeper or are not used to noises like that, we would not recommend this room. It was a good place to stay to explore Gettysburg."

Stayed a few nights","This place was so charming, beautiful and quaint. Expect a B and B atmosphere, you have a room in an old timey house (some have their own bathrooms) and the downstairs is a community space to hang. Parking is super easy, checking in simple and the kitchen has a bunch of goodies with an adorable retro decor. There is a flight of stairs to get to the upper bedrooms but the owner was so kind and carried our suitcases up. They were so accomodating, friendly and provided password for internet upon arrival. We did find the internet a bit unstable but it could've been the crazy weather. Be prepared to use your own passwords for most premium streaming services but there was basic cable at the time we stayed and they just set up Roku, so it might be different now. We will be back. We loved it."

Stayed a few nights","This is a AMAZING place to stay if you are going to Gettysburg! The whole decor of the house is special and draws you into a time gone by. What a perfect setting to visit a place where so much history has happened.
We could not be more pleased with the accommodations, the location WAS perfect, and they are just really nice people!!! (My husband so enjoyed talking WWII military history with Barbara’s husband!)l.
You really cannot go wrong. We loved it so much (and there is so much history to experience in this area.) that we were able to add a 3rd night! (Lucky for us they had a cancellation.)
You literally are within walking distance of so much history, shops and restaurants! Two very special spots that we enjoyed eating at (and are in easy walking distance) are the Dobbin Tavern. It’s in the cellar of a building that was built in 1776 and waitstaff are dressed in that time period. (They have a high end fancier menu but they also have yummy sandwiches that come with a side for those who want lunch or to have something lighter .)
The other is on the same block as The Sentimental Journey called the Farnsworth Restaurant. The restaurant is in a historic home that was built in the early 1800’s. It is fine dining and the waitstaff are also in period attire.
We had a great visit to Gettysburg and we highly recommend staying here at the Cozy Inn/sentimental Journey!!! You will not be disappointed!!! Bonus - I Loved the claw foot soaking tub!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Barbara was a gracious hostess who exceeded my expectations from day one. I needed a ""mini-retreat"" to clear my mind and rejuvenate my body and Barbara's ""Sentinmental Journey"" was just the ticket. I love history and her thoughtfully appointed rooms put me right back in the moment. The location was ""to die for"" as it was walkable to eateries and pubs and the historically-rich downtown gettysburg. As a bonus, her location is right on Baltimore Avenue, along the route Lincoln took from the train station to deliver the ""Gettysburg Address"". From a photo she provided, it looks like Lincoln stoppped not yards from what is now the the front of the house, (then a 1800's Tannery), to wave to the crowd and perhaps say a few words before making his way to the venue of what is regarded as one of the most important speeches in American History. All I had to do was look out my front window to see where Lincoln rode and imagine that moment in time. Her rooms are period to the house's 1920's legacy which helped me internalize other key moments and eras in America history which also served to help save our Republic. I would recommend if you're coming to Gettysburg to relive the moment in the Civil War that our Union was decisively preserved, come to Barbara's ""Sentimental Journey"". Here, she provides an opportunity for an experience which will eliven your senses and help you to attain a new perspective not only of our nation's history but also of your own personal journey."

Stayed a few nights","You can’t beat the Sentimental Journey B&B for all of the essential considerations one takes into account for accommodation - location (perfectly situated between the Square, battlefield, and trendy restaurants/hotspots… majority within convenient walking distance)… price (extremely affordable compared to every other over-priced, unreliable option)… hospitality (Barbara and her family are the epitome of the word)… comfort (privacy and tranquility in abundance; these rooms are meant for people on the go and spending the bulk of their day exploring, but if the trip called for it you could rest and relax throughout the day without issue)… and flexibility (apart from acquiring your keys and parking pass at check-in you are able to come and go as you please - adhering to the quiet hours of course!).
For all future guests - don’t be an entitled slob and leave your used mugs, silverware, etc. in the sink of the shared kitchenette. Cleaning supplies are readily available; it’s the LEAST you could do for all of the complimentary snacks and amenities the host family provides!"

It’s located within walking distance of the town square, right by a ton of shops and restaurants, and is right near the national cemetery and the northern part of the military park. Barbara responded quickly to a messaged question and was very thoughtful regarding how she set up the room. Overall I’d highly recommend!"

Despite this, the location allowed for an easy walk to Gettysburg's downtown ... in the snow ... and to two local breweries, as well as plenty of places to eat. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. We loved the antique decor. The breakfast food provided was varied and plentiful. Check in was great as we enjoyed discussing with Steve the WW II model aircraft and tank display in the front foyer. This was a great find on airbnb, and will be our go to lodging whenever we go back to Gettysburg."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at this property for three nights. I was happy with the accommodation. My room was across the street from the main house. The room was on the ground floor. There was plenty of light, a comfortable bed, a good shower and an overall clean room. It's nice and quiet at bedtime. There is plenty of parking as well.
The property is walking distance to pretty much everything. It's a ten minute walk into the other part of Gettysburg. So easy!
Barbara and Steve are both very nice, and helpful.
The only drawbacks we're that my room only had Roku tv. I wanted to watch the baseball games after dinner and could not. Not the end of the world though. My particular room didn't have WiFi. They will have WiFi soon.
I definitely recommend staying here. I would certainly stay again upon my return to Gettysburg."

this b&b & each room is quite historical with a uniqueness in antiquities of decades gone by (a time travel of the past)...
i stayed in the room representing the 1940's during the war time era; quite cozy & most comfortable...extra bonus: they also are the proprietors of ""cone sweet cone"" in the adjoining building & their watermelon italian ice...best iv'e ever tasted, that i indulged 3 days in a row!!
""a sentimental journey"" is in a perfect location only minutes from everything in every direction of gettysburg...

Stayed a few nights","Barbara and Steve were wonderful hosts. This place was perfect for our three day visit, right in the center of town. (The Memorial Day parade passed right outside!) And it was easy to walk to a bunch of shops and historic buildings. Bicycling or a short drive took us easily to the many parts of the battlefield. The very generous 24 hour/a day snacks were much appreciated. We were given cards to two different personal guides. Both called back within minutes. Our guide drove our car for two hours (with frequent stops) and took us to all the different parts of the battlefield and told numerous details about what happened in 1863. His name is Fran Feyock. (He only asked for $63!)
Overall: a great stay and experience. We would very much like to come back some day!

This was a great place to stay. You are right in the center of everything. The period rooms were amazing and very clean. It was nice to just sit on the porch and watch everything going on in town. The homemade ice cream shop right next door was an added bonus.
On another note I scratched my Cornelia. Barbara was great . She got us the name and address for an urgent care and found that there were only 2 patients ahead of us.
I can't thank you enough for that.
All in all we had a great stay. This was our first experience with AirB&B Definitely stay here again and try different places .

Even then I was within 5 minutes of anything I wanted to do. You've got tons of eating options all within a 5 minute walk from the house. What surprised me was how quiet the house was at night. I only saw a couple people that were staying there at the same time as me. I had to cut my stay short by a day, and Barbara was extremely accommodating with me having to leave a day early. I plan on going back to Gettysburg probably next summer and I definitely intend on staying here again."

Our host took his time to explain the layout of the land and various locations in town. Most places are walking distance from this ideal location. The breakfast room was stock full of a great assortment of beverages and food items. This is in my opinion a five star bed and breakfast. I shall be sure to return next season in the warmer weather.

It's a very old building but there was ample hot water and space and the antiques were quaint and interesting. It was warm and inviting and we couldn't really hear the other guests. Barbara and her family were very helpful with information about the area and there was convenient ample parking out back. Finally, there were so many breakfast choices we could have stayed a week and never had the same thing twice. We definitely recommend you stay here and we hope to be back next summer."

The room was roomy and spotless. The bed was super comfortable. Loved that there was our own private bathroom. The kitchen was stocked with snack, pastries, bagels, yogurt and fruit. There was plenty to eat and an array of teas, coffees and cappuccinos. But beyond that the location of the quaint little BnB was ideal for Gettysburg. You could walk to all the great restaurants and shops and of course the Civil War Cemetery. We absolutely loved everything about our stay here and would definitely stay here again. Oh....make sure you use your free scoop of ice cream coupon they give you because they make the best ice cream at their little ice cream shop next door😊"

The house is just like the photos but better if that makes sense? The attention to detail that Barbara and Steve have makes this a wonderful place to stay in Gettysburg. The bed was super comfy with plenty of pillows and lovely soft sheets, the bathroom was spotless with fluffy towels and a good supply of hot water. Plenty of sockets for charging items like phones and in the kitchen was the most wonderful range of foods for breakfast including fresh coffee, juice, tea, bagels, fresh fruit, muffins and pastries, yoghurt....you will love the fact it’s open for a snack in the evening ( or anytime)
Barbara and Steve are brilliant hosts, so helpful and accommodating. The 4 nights we spent here were perfect. We will return here when we next visit America.
Don’t forget to try the ice cream it’s heavenly"

Each of the 6 rooms had a different chronological theme and the 1950s kitchen was filled with snacks and drinks. Perfect location for taking a walking tour of Gettysburg. We highly recommend booking here.

The B&B has great décor to look at and plenty of snacks available to keep you going for your battlefield walks. Location was perfect. Plenty of great things are close and an easy walk. It is only about a 10 minute walk to the center of town. The B&B is a short drive to the military park visitor center and right at the edge of old town. Also, there is a great ice cream and gelato shop attached the B&B that is a must try! Delicious and be sure to ask about their ""Tipsy Dips""! We LOVED the Fireball and champagne cream flavors! Barbara is so incredibly sweet and accommodating. She even lent us her car we had car problems for a day! I would not hesitate to stay here again!"

Immaculately clean. Everything works. The grounds are beautiful. Everything is as depicted. Great place to wake up for a day of doing whatever you like to do on the battlefield. Just roll out of bed, drive a very few minutes and you’re right there where it all began. Abbey was a very responsive and gracious host. And a bowl of dog biscuits, a bowl of water, and a doggie bed were waiting for my furry companion. Such nice touches. Just loved it."

Friday the cat ran out to greet us as soon as we arrived :) Inside, we found a dish of duck food to make friends with their ducks- we loved that! There’s also an electric fireplace that warmed us up in no time after getting soaked on a rainy ghost tour in town. The location is perfect, really short drive to town, and right on a little river bank. It was so peaceful and we felt right at home with all the thoughtful personal touches like extra toiletries and coffee. We would definitely love to stay with Abbey and Dusty again in the future, thank you both for making our stay so comfortable and welcoming!"

They’re particular about their property and rightly so. The house is nestled in the middle of rolling countryside, butted up against a beautiful story book like river. Just minutes away from all the battle field history and the cute town of Gettysburg. Would be fantastic for a romantic getaway or like my family. A quick break to a historical part of America.

Stayed a few nights","Probably the best AirBnB I’ve stayed at. Very cute. Very cozy. Very comfortable. Decorated perfectly. Not a speck of dust or finger print. A welcome book had so much information. Muffins and snacks. Every kitchen item. Just about every hygiene item. There were so many pros as listed in the advertisement, and really no cons, except squeaky floors but it’s an old house. A small drive into historic Gettysburg. Windows are places really low, but plenty of privacy with the blinds. I didn’t want to leave. They really set the bar for AirBNBs. I almost got a place in town and am so glad i didn’t. It’s not easy to find if it’s late at night, if you’re using a slow GPS, so driving really slow as you get within .5 mile is a must so you don’t miss the turn. I can’t give enough stars for this place. The first 2 minutes I was ready to leave this review. One of my favorite but unused touches is the ice bucket in the freezer. Last, Gettysburger and Dobbin House—highly recommended."

Lee Ann and Scott truly thought of EVERYTHING you could need, literally down to little shelves next to the beds to charge your phone. The home is immaculate-clean, beautifully decorated, and so so homey. The hosts are communicative and respond in an extremely timely manner. Everything about this place is worth the trip and the money. You can definitely tell Lee Ann and Scott are extremely passionate about their home and they are not lying when they say they’ve made a little piece of paradise."

Stayed with kids",We stayed at Lee Ann and Scott's home for a quick overnight family snow tubing trip with our two children. We were very pleased with our stay. They were very accommodating especially with allowing us to check in a few hours early since there was no one staying the night before us. The home was exactly how it was pictured and beautifully decorated. There was plenty of room for our two children to play around. They loved the little kids nook and enjoyed sitting in there to read some stories. The home was completely stocked with everything we needed and then some. No detail to small was missed in their home. From the charging spaces in the bedrooms to the unbelievably stocked kitchen cookware and necessities. We have never stayed somewhere that had literally everything (minus the food of course) to cook a whole meal. We will definitely be staying here again over the summer and are looking forward to getting to enjoy sipping coffee while watching the goats across the way.

We love the area - just outside of town felt so peaceful. My son loved the reading nook and the sheep farm next door. From beginning to end we had the most pleasant and peaceful stay. Anything you might need the lovely hosts had already thought of! Great recommendations for town and great communication from hosts! The place is historic and beautiful - if you want modern (OR if you are super super tall) maybe try something else - but you can truly appreciate the love and care in this Home and with these hosts!!! If Airbnb had more hosts like them it would be a better place.

Stayed about a week","We had the privilege of staying for a week in the 2022 Gettysburg’s Best Vacation Rental. It was perfect for our family of 4 while we explored Gettysburg and visited Hershey, which is only about an hour away. The location of the cottage just outside of town, offers very peaceful surroundings. Getting to the Visitor Center, historic sites, and the grocery store is a very short drive away.
We could hear the sheep across the field and said hello to the cows with babies every time we drove away for our daily adventures. It’s very quiet here; and no, there aren’t farm smells. The kids loved wading in Marsh Creek, pointing out crawfish and skipping rocks. The neighboring fields twinkle in the evening with all the fireflies, adding to the charm of this property.
We were surprised how much space there is inside the cottage. It is much larger than we anticipated. The furniture is comfortable and very tasteful. All the decor is adorable.
Blue Coat cottage is very welcoming from the moment you step inside. There is an overall feeling of being “home” here. The hosts go above and beyond with anticipating anything a guest may need. There was even a handwritten note and muffins for our arrival! The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and supplies as is the bathroom and laundry room. It is wonderful that we are taking home minimal laundry at the end of a long week. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend to our friends and family that may be traveling to the area. Thank you to Scott and Lee Ann for all their kindness and quick responses to messages. We had a fabulous time."

Stayed a few nights","What a lovely stay at the Blue Coat Cottage just about 2 miles outside of downtown Gettysburg in the country side close to the Military Park, next door to two farms and across the road from Marsh Creek. Much better than staying in the busy downtown area!
Lee Ann and Scott have beautifully renovated this 112 year old cottage with lovely decor, warm and inviting colors and equipped it with everything you will need for a wonderful stay.
The beautiful linens, wonderful towels, fully equipped kitchen, and all the goodies and snacks, coffees, teas, condiments were greatly appreciated. They even provided nightlights which are always welcomed in a home away from home.
Although we didn’t need them, they even had toothpaste, toothbrushes, and other toiletries if needed.
The outside table and chairs on the back patio were perfect for watching the birds and rabbits during wine time or morning coffee before heading to Gettysburg Military Park each day.
They were very prompt and cordial in messaging and offered great suggestions to assist in our visit to the area.
We would not hesitate returning and recommending a stay at the Blue Coat Cottage!"

Stayed with kids","This is an adorable 1910 summer home that has been beautifully updated to create a lovely, cozy, comfortable and enjoyable space to stay while exploring Gettysburg. Scott and LeAnn define superhosts, with coffee, tea and condiments available, a well stocked kitchen, a snack/candy basket and even pancake mix and syrup for guests’ use! There is an adorable kid’s corner under the stairs and a roku enabled TV with cozy couches in the living room.
As described in the listing, this is a 1910 house and ceilings are very low. My 6’ husband almost had to duck to get thru doorways and even I at 5’8” would hit my head on the master bedroom’s ceiling fan/light fixture if I didn’t pay attention. However, the beautiful cottage, thoughtful details, cleanliness and comfort of the entire stay far outshines this minor drawback. An overall wonderful stay."

We were a group of 3 friends, so we each got our own room, and all 3 rooms were a good size with a comfortable bed, window, and a ledge and outlet for your devices. We cooked a bunch during our stay, which was a joy in the well-stocked kitchen. It’s a great location for visiting the battlefield and for a nice hike.

We were enamored by all of the little details - spices, a coffee bar, breakfast items, a frozen pizza, cookies to welcome us, cleaning supplies, extra toiletries in the bathroom, extension cords to plug in phones at the bedside, and throw blankets to snuggle under with a good book. The cabin was very clean and spacious - great spaces for our family to come together and play games and eat meals together, but also plenty of room for naps and quiet reading. Our kids were thrilled with the little nook under the stairs and the small wooded area in the back. The weather was perfect for us to sit on the patio and walk along the river. The location was also ideal - just a quick trip to all the sites. We’re already talking about when to go back! Thank you!!"

We enjoyed watching the birds at the bird feeders from the kitchen door. It was too cold to enjoy the small patio and outdoor table and chairs, but we did take a relaxing walk along the creek one morning. With one bathroom and a small footprint not sure how it would work with 6 guests, but we found it was the perfect size for 2 sisters looking for a quiet getaway."

Bed was really comfortable.
The stairs aren’t as steep as other reviews have said. We didn’t see a problem with them. The door is really easy to get in and out. Parking around the corner is a mere seconds walk away.
On arrival we parked outside on the meter but on leaving walked our suitcases around to our car.

Stayed a few nights","This was my third stay at Top O’ The Stairs and it will absolutely remain my top choice when visiting Gettysburg. Andrea is a wonderful, responsive, friendly host. The apartment is comfortable, well-equipped, clean, homey, and quiet with a very private entrance. Having a washer and dryer in the unit is a huge plus for me. The location is an easy walk to the square and many restaurants and shops.
Things to consider include the steep, narrow steps (inside this older home) up into the unit - getting my large, heavy suitcase up is a challenge. The unit is located on a street that can serve as a cut-through alternative to the very busy main drag parallel to it - it’s very quiet during the evenings and nighttime but traffic really revs up at 7 AM so no sleeping in. Parking is available directly in front of the unit but it’s metered - the free parking offered by the owner requires a walk that takes a minute or two from the alley along the side street to the unit."

The Airbnb was very large and clean, we felt super at home and comfy and Andrea responded so quickly to all of my questions - such a great couple!! This contemporary home was definitely better than the alternatives of older bed & breakfasts around the area.. would come again for sure to stay at this central spot!"

Everything about it was absolutely amazing in every way! The Apartment was extremely clean and well stocked! Amenities such as: bottled water and pastries, Wi-Fi , televisions in every room, and bookshelves with a variety of reading materials were available! In addition, there were brochures regarding things to see and do in this historic place. Our questions were promptly and courteously addressed by texts, phone calls, or quick visits from one of the hosts! All our expectations were met and exceeded! This was our second visit here, and we look forward to returning! Thanks to our ""Hosts"" for such a wonderful place to stay!

Stayed with kids","Andrea's AirBnB was great. The kitchen was large and roomy, the bathroom was very clean, and the mattress was firm but we found it comfortable. There were plenty of extra blankets. There is a bit of road noise - the road is more of a main road than we had anticipated - but it does quiet down quickly after 11:30-12 PM and we slept fine. Our family has members that are very sensitive to noise, though, so it may not bother others. The location was otherwise fantastic and we hardly used the car at all due to the walkable location. There were complimentary bottles of water, which, while we brought our own, kept us from having to buy more water, so that was great. Literally the only thing less than a 10/10 was the living room could have slightly comfier furniture, maybe a cozier set of chairs for relaxing in after a long, hot day walking around, but that's so minor and we would stay here again without hesitation. One of our favorite AirBnB stays!"

The apartment is a short walking distance to all of the restaurants and shops in town (we walked everywhere we wanted to go within a 10-15 minute walk). Just a suggestion if you're a light sleeper to bring a fan like we did, which helps drown out some traffic noises from outside when you're sleeping. Overall the apartment was great and we would definitely stay again!"

Andrea’s had awesome amenities, including a washer and dryer, ample cookware, a fully stocked coffee/tea bar, and even umbrellas for the rain shower we encountered. For any runners/walkers, there is a trail next to the middle school (a couple minutes walk away), that is a 3-4 mile loop around Culp’s Hill. It was such a lovely stay, thanks again!"

The kitchen, living room, and bedroom with king bed are sparkling clean, good-sized, bright rooms with comfortable furniture and nice decorations. We found the bed very comfortable. The kitchen is equipped for full meal preparation, or you may choose to walk to a wide variety of restaurants. The internet was great for teleworking - no problems with team meetings. The owners clearly pay attention to detail - there are many little extras not found in every Airbnb. There is a great selection of tourist information as well as nonfiction and novels about the Civil War. There is metered parking in front of the house and there is also a reserved spot behind the house. There is a small patio table and two chairs for sitting outside to enjoy coffee or a drink. This apartment is on the second floor - be advised there are stairs (the name is a give-away - Top of the Stairs!). The owners are very attentive to any questions you may have but also very respectful of your privacy. We thoroughly enjoyed our three-week stay in this apartment and highly recommend it to anyone, and are looking forward to a return visit!"

I know a lot of people come to Gettysburg for the history, but if any distance runners or cyclists are reading this, you will have miles upon miles of scenic, historic paths to run/ride on, all just mere steps from Top O’ the Stairs. You just can’t beat it!"

Furniture was comfortable as was the king-sized bed. Andrea provides high-end organic soap, shampoo and conditioner. ""Downtown"" is a pleasant walk away - great location. The folder on the bottom shelf of the bookcase provides much helpful info. There is a ""car tour guide"" of the Battlefield with two CD's for your use in the bookcase, too. We enjoyed our stay here!"

Stayed a few nights",Great place in Gettysburg. The apartment was very clean and well maintained with a comfortable bed. Additionally I liked how there were signs directing you to the apartment. The instructions for parking and entry were precise and we had zero problems during our stay. We like Airbnb because you can get a feel for how it would be to live in the city to which your are staying and Andrea's place did just that. Be advised Gettysburg is a busy little city with a lot of traffic. Andrea's place is within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants (highly recommend Gary Owen's Irish Pub) and it is best to walk because parking can be a bit of a challenge. There is some traffic noise in the apartment during the day but it is quiet during the night. Again a great place to stay and we wouldn't hesitate to return.

The hosts are open that there are a lot of steps up to the unit. The stairwell is rather narrow and it proved to be a bit of a challenge for me to get my oversized suitcase up.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I were traveling through on our honeymoon, and needed a quick place to stay. Thankfully were lucky enough to have snagged a few nights in this well sought after place, and were not disappointed. The place had an adorable walk up and entrance, and once you got in the place you felt comfy and at home. Andrea provided anything and everything you could ask for, along with complimentary goodies in the freezer and coffee station. The place was beautifully decorated, with bookshelves full of books of all kind ( found some old mystery/sci-fi novels I read as a child, that was a nice jolt of nostalgia), a king size bed in the bedroom ( score ) and a homey yet modern feel to the place where you could sense the history of the building and city.
We were lucky enough to meet Andrea and her husband Jesse, both very lovely and friendly people, and their beautiful family. They have a couple of outside cats that are very sweet, and will come up to you while you're sitting at the adorable cafe table and chairs that our right outside the doorsteps. My husband was lucky enough to meet both of the cats ( still jealous).
We would recommend this place to everyone. You will not be disappointed, we certainly weren't. The place is in a great a location right in the middle of everything, wonderful hosts with great communication, and a cozy place to come back to after a long day of site seeing. We can't wait to be back in the area, and book again with them!"

Stayed a few nights","My fiancé and I really enjoyed our stay at the Top of the Stairs. It is much more spacious than one of the local B&B's or hotels and less than 5 minute walk from the square where there are many restaurant, pub, shop and ghost walk options. The home was clean and comfortable with many nice extra touches like bottled water, coffee pods, condiments, info on local attractions and extra blankets. Since this is in downtown Gettysburg, Andrea sends helpful info about where to park when unloading and then they have a dedicated space that is just a minute around the corner where there are no meters. We really appreciated this as it appears parking isn't easy in this area especially if in a busier season of the year. As a plus, we only needed the car when going to the Battlefields but not for other local attractions. We definitely will look to stay here again when back in Gettysburg! Thanks Andrea!"

The national park biking is great, but taking day trips to the Orchid region north of Gettysburg and dairy region south of the city was outstanding. The Gettysburg Bicycle shop is 5 minutes away and provided excellent advice on 30-40 mile routes off the beaten track with little car traffic. The kitchen is spacious, bright, and well equipped for cooking after being out all day. The apartment faces southeast but is very bright once the blinds are opened. On a scale of 1-10, this place exceeded our expectations (15+) - many thanks Andrea for the hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the PERFECT place to stay for a Gettysburg visit! Location couldn't be better, especially when you consider it includes parking! In my opinion, the pictures don't do the apartment justice, it is very cute. We had three adults staying and it was plenty of space; the futon is actually very comfortable! Check-in and out is a breeze because they have a keypad on the door instead of having to keep up with a key. Andrea and her family were incredibly responsive when we had a couple of questions during the stay and went above and beyond to be hospitable. Walking around the corner to their parking area is no big deal at all, it's only about a 30-second walk, so don't let that keep you away! (Makes sense to me they want to keep their backyard private for their kids and dogs; plus they've set up a table and chairs outside the Airbnb door just for guests if you do want to sit outside, so you have your own space!) If it's available for our dates next year, we plan to be back!"

Kitchen well-stocked and easy to use. Really enjoyed the coffee maker and the large coffee mugs. Spent mornings hanging out with coffee in the living room, flipping through the books in the apartment and planning our day. Stocked up on some weekend groceries at a local market within walking distance (about ten minutes). Andrea is a gracious host. She responded quickly to messages, and has stocked the apartment with much local information. Check-in and check-out were simple/straightforward. We would definitely stay here again!

We hope to continue to rent from families like these two as we travel the states! The place was literally sparkling clean and this comes from a former house cleaner of 4+years. It was centrally located to all of the things that we wanted to do as a family. We were able to ride our bikes all around the city of Gettysburg without any trouble and we even had a parking spot which is a bonus! There are meters everywhere but because of the location we were able to walk to all of the shops easily. Our hosts left us some goodies in the kitchen which was great while we were there! The place was cute and we had a wonderful time. It was a quiet street, I didn't hear any loud distractions while trying to sleep and everything we needed in a home away from home was there. Thank you again for an extremely pleasant first experience!"

You are two blocks away from the center of town with its historic buildings, restaurants and shops; and a quick drive to the battlefield. Andrea has up-dated the spacious one-bedroom second-story apartment — refurbished bathroom and kitchen. She keeps a very tidy and uncluttered place. We loved the king size bed, comfortable living space and book shelves filled with historical and contemporary books. We highly recommend Andrea’s apartment to anyone interested in visiting Gettysburg."

Stayed a few nights","The Top 'O the Stairs was probably the cleanest and most comfortable AirBnB residence I've stayed in. We really loved all the little touches Andrea had taken the trouble to put in place. Everything anyone could want was there and The place was very tastefully done up without going over the top, and it was also outstandingly clean! I especially loved the large, well equipped kitchen and comfortable bed. The location is also very convenient and close to everything (Gettysburg is a pretty small town)
Andrea's communication was also very good. I arrived late at night and It was a bit tricky to find the house in the dark because I could not see house numbers on most of the homes on the street. Thankfully Andrea provides detailed directions and tips to locate the place as well as how to park in the back alleyway.
I'm certain you will enjoy your stay at the Top O' the Stairs! I love Gettysburg and the rich history it is steeped in."

Stayed a few nights","What an absolutely charming experience staying at ""The Top of The Stairs."" The location is excellent: close to 24-hour market, Walmart, restaurants, shops, museums, and the battlefield. The neighborhood is quiet, filled with lovely old homes. Parking available! The decor was wonderful, and everywhere were gorgeous oils painted by a family artist. The space is large and IMMACULATE!! Full size frig, stove, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, etc. Fully equipped kitchen with counter and bar stools. Great washer and dryer and lots of other amenities; too many to delineate here. The bed was King size and very comfortable. And, the couch was very comfy, too, which we find is somewhat rare in the B&B market. HBO, Netflix... We felt like we could move in! I was a little worried about the stairs with my arthritic feet, but they did not pose a problem. Rates were reasonable. Andrea provided clear instructions on parking and check-in very shortly after booking, so check-in/out was a cinch. We've stayed at many AirBNB and VRBO properties in the U.S. and Europe, and this one is right up there with the best. Honestly, you can't go wrong with this outstanding rental! Highly recommended!!"

Stayed a few nights","We had mixed feelings about this apartment. On the one hand it's a great location in Gettysburg - you can walk to a lot of restaurants, and the town's Halloween parade past very (very) close to this apartment on our first night there. On the other hand, this apartment is too small to accommodate four adults - it accommodates four people only if two of the four are small (and I stress small) children. Also, guests are not allowed to walk through the house's backyard to reach the parking space off the ally behind the house. Instead, guests must walk around the block. This would not be such a big deal except that: (1) the privacy signs posted at the entrances to the backyard might make you feel unwelcome (that's how they made me feel) and (2) this detour obliges you to walk past an extremely foul-smelling area that a nearby restaurant uses to dump its waste. Overall, if you don't mind holding you nose to reach your car, then this is a great place for two, and max three people for a short visit to Gettysburg."

Stayed a few nights",Great location and very clean. The bed was comfortable and we could not have asked for a better place to stay for our girls weekend to Gettysburg. We have stayed in a few other places in the past and we would love to make Top O' The Stairs our new home away from home for our Gettysburg weekend. Not having cable was the only thing that made our stay not perfect. Andrea was very honest with us and let us know that they did have to cancel cable after we made our reservations but we didn't realize how that would impact our trip until we were living without cable. With the hurricane making landfall this past weekend we would have liked to watch local news. We also would have liked the option to stay in and watch the NFL games in the apartment rather than having to go to a local bar. Hopefully Andrea and Jesse can look into options with cable providers for cable options for renters. We would pay for cable if that would be provided as an option as an extra perk.

Stayed a few nights","Chris' place is located in historic Gettysburg. We walked everywhere in town. In fact, the walking tour we took led us almost to our doorstep. The furnishings -- except for the bed, which is not comfortable -- were great. I had read reviews, so I brought a salad bowl, extra plates and bowls, and serving utensils. I was surprised that there is only one large pot, one small one, and a small and large frying pan. There are no pot lids. Cooking was a bit awkward, but most people probably go out for meals. The photos don't give the place justice. It is brighter than it appears in the pictures, and there is a table with three chairs for meals. We also set up our laptop there. The Wi-Fi is just fine. Be alert to the step up to kitchen and also to the bathroom from the rest of the house. Chris is responsive and generous."

Stayed a few nights","Because it is a certified historic home, this is probably the most unique vacation rental we've ever had. It is well cared for, interestingly decorated, and welcoming. We enjoyed making meals in the kitchen. All of the appliances were clean and in good working order. The house is located on a busy thoroughfare, however since we spent daylight hours touring the local area, we didn't experience the peak of congestion. The house was quiet evening/night. The space is fine for two careful adults. I would suggest high visibility safety tape to be placed on the floor at entraces from both the kitchen and bathroom to mark the substantial step-down into the living room the living room. I came close to a bad fall shortly after arriving because I wasn't yet used to the step-down. Bottom line: Chris provides a cozy, clean, thoughtfully appointed space conveniently located to take in the best of Gettysburg. We would recommend it and stay here again ourselves."

Stayed a few nights","This was such a convenient location to so many restaurants and activities. Overall, I was happy with our stay. The house was comfortable and pretty clean, which was really all we needed!
My biggest concern was that I didn’t realize the house was on such a busy street (we were also in Gettysburg during the anniversary of the battle, so there was more vehicle and foot traffic than normal). Just a warning for anyone easily disturbed by noise or people walking by the windows.
I would also comment that while the house has a full kitchen, it has quite rudimentary cooking utensils. I had expected to do more cooking in the house during our stay rather than eat out for every meal, but struggled to find things like cutting boards and knives. Although - the house is so close to many amazing restaurants, we weren’t without options.
Like I said, overall the place was a wonderful pick! Clean, cozy, and a nice escape to relax."

The list of amenities that Chris provided was very helpful in letting me know what to pack and not pack. This was our first time at an Airbnb and we were very pleased with the accommodations and the responsive communication with Chris. My only suggestion would be about the visibility of house numbers outside. Our GPS took us right to the back-entrance driveway and when we opened the gate, we did not know which house to go into since there were several doors to different buildings. We walked around the side street to the front of the house and we finally found the house numbers on the inside of the door frame behind the storm door, which is difficult to see from the street. House numbers right on the front door and back door would be very helpful to guests. Thank you again, Chris."

Chris also had a ‘little museum’ - nice antique pieces, some found on the battle fields, others during scuba dives. A very enjoyable stay."

Stayed a few nights","Chris's place is perfect for a single traveler or a couple. The place is so clean, and I have to say, the photos don't do it justice (there's not a lot of overhead lighting, so this is understandable).
I didn't have a plan when I arrived, but after walking around upon arrival, and deciding to book a double-decker tour of the battlefield (I could walk to the starting point), I decided I would leave my car parked the entire trip and walk everywhere. It was a hot week (mid 90s), but it was great to have Chris's place as an ""oasis"" to return to several times a day to cool off and have a water break, and drop off purchases from the many shops and wine rooms nearby.
If you like a firm mattress, this place is for you! The water pressure in the shower was great. The hot water in the kitchen gets hot VERY quickly, so be careful.
If I decide to visit Gettysburg in the future, this is the place I'll seek out."

There are two thin books in the house that provide excellent biking information. We ate at the Dobbin House one evening. It was expensive ($100 for two) but well worth it. We ate at the Lincoln Diner for lunch. Probably would have been better for breakfast. Lunch was nothing to write home about. We did a self-guided driving tour, which was a free app, and that was all we needed. We also watched a couple videos on you tube and once again that was all we needed. We spent the rest of the time riding our bikes, walking, and driving around the battlefield. Bottom line - You can’t go wrong with this house or a visit to Gettysburg."

Small touches like guide books, DVDs, cold bottled water, coffee and toiletries made this a truly great experience that exceeded all expectations! Add to this the owner’s information about the history of the house as well as restaurant and other recommendations certainly helped make this trip both very memorable and enjoyable. Our recommendation for future guests is to reach out to the owner with all your questions. Chris is both very responsive and very helpful and can help you plan appropriately. If we make it back to Gettysburg in the future, we will certainly look to stay here again! If it is available for your stay, book it!"

We had no idea what we wanted to see other than where, when and how. We could've driven ourselves but would not have gotten nearly the info that we got from our guide, David by the way!

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful place - and more than I expected! I appreciated the extra touch of videos & DVD player. I had wanted to see the Jeff Daniels/Martin Sheen ""Gettysburg"" movie before touring the park, and I thought I'd have to pay money to stream it. But nope - Chris has a copy of it there. Yay!
Excellent decor, comfy bed, living room, etc. And indeed within walking distance to everything! The only reason I knocked one star of the ""location"" rating is that the neighborhood is a bit run-down looking. But after driving around the town, it seems a lot of it is like that. So saying - I never felt unsafe, and any meetups with neighbors or those in the area were totally fine.
I stayed in cold weather. When I arrived, I got the heat in the various rooms going and despite it being an old house, it was very toasty. I was totally comfortable and Chris has some lovely blankets to lounge on the couch with. Flannel sheets on the bed, too!
This was a great place for me to stay for some much needed R&R. Thank you, Chris!"

The house itself was very clean, comfortable and we found everything we needed there. We did not prepare meals, but I’m sure you could if you desired.
I also appreciated the hosts quick responses to my questions. When I asked if there was somewhere that I could smoke a cigar, he set me up in the backyard with chairs and a fire! I was a happy camper for sure!

A curio cabinet holds treasures from the past. Artwork worthy of a museum. Internet worked great along with the nice large cable tv. The air conditioning felt great after a hot day touring the battlefield. I look forward to returning to this charming, convenient, comfortable home, priced well below its value. There is also a nice yard we enjoyed as the day cooled off. Highly recommend!"

I loved the entry system as there was no confusion about keys or concern about getting locked out. The house was spacious and each room had everything you could possibly need, even the bathrooms. We were only there for 2 nights but I could see being comfortable there for longer. The location was really central too - easy to get to Lincoln Square, Baltimore Street shopping and our home away from home GlenOwen's Pub! My mom is a Gettysburg native so we didn't need much guidance from Dan but I'm confident his recommendations would have delivered had we asked. I highly recommend staying here and hope to do so again in the future!"

The house was immaculate and the exceptional coming together of the old and new conveniences. It was so comfortable. The kitchen had all appliances needed to fix a meal, but the floor and a wall were original and added such flair. There was so much room with comfortable beds, great showers and a washroom with all the latest appliances. A sweet little sitting room upstairs with the most comfortable wicker chairs and windows for natural well-lit light. There was private parking in the back for our van. The location was perfect. About 1/2 block to the main street with shopping, antique stores and restaurants. We travel to Gettysburg every year, and this is the absolute best Airbnb home we have had the pleasure of renting. There were also books galore, suggestions of little off places to visit and loads of games and huge tv. My husband and I will be back-definitely."

Stayed a few nights","We had such a great experience at Dan's house in Gettysburg. The check-in instructions were crystal clear, and Dan responded very quickly anytime we had a question. It was obvious from the moment we walked in that we were going to be quite comfortable. So many little details that were well thought out. We appreciated the bottled water in the fridge, sunscreen, laundry detergent, among other things. Dan had a really neat scrapbook with recommendations for restaurants and things to do. The best part was how conveniently located the property was. All within one block we had a grocery store, coffee shop, brewery, and Crossfit Gym. Lincoln Square is two blocks away, making it an easy walk. Without a doubt we will stay at this property again the next time we visit Gettysburg!"

It was in the perfect location for exploring downtown Gettysburg. The parking was convenient, especially for the neighborhood. We wouldn’t hesitate to book this house again!"

Stayed with kids",This place was absolutely beautiful and located close to the center of town. Clean and very nice place to spend time. The hose was very responsive and helpful. Not only was the house and location perfect the hosts left a lot of informative information in the house from brochures and getting to know Gettysburg. Our favorite was that they left the Jr. Ranger books for Gettysburg. It was great. Our 4 kids participate in the Jr Ranger Programs at all of the national parks and it allowed them to get a start on the books before arriving at the Gettysburg battlefield! This was just one example of a fantastic touch. Highly recommend the location and the house and the host! Rebecca

The host, Dan was extremely helpful with clear instructions for checkin and checkout. He made welcomed suggestions for local things to do in the area. My family loved that there was an electronic door pad with a customized code for easy entry while coming and going. We would definitely stay again and rate our stay 5 stars."

We discovered that we had a lot in common which made the trust level high from the start. It seemed like there were constant updates and he gave us a ton of recommendations based on our family (2 adults and 2 kids, 10 and 12). The house was immaculate and just right, easy parking and so close to everything! The neighbors and merchants surrounding the house were even pleasant. Absolutely recommend this place and I’m sure if we go back, we won’t have to do any research: just pull up our past trips and pick the dates! Everything you need and more and such a reasonable rate. Thanks Dan!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at Lincoln Slept Near Here. Everything was absolutely top notch; hosts thought of everything down to embossed closure on the spare toilet paper roll. Super easy check in. Host was very responsive in communication and answering questions. The inside of the house was very nice; renovation feeling of an old building. The house had definite charm with some uneven floors, tasteful rough hewn flooring, and wall covering which definitely lent to the charm and authenticity of being in Gettysburg. A very nice kitchen that was well appointed and had all new appliances; we could have easily cooked for several families had we had more guests. Lots of nice little places to sit and get a moment or enjoy coffee. We loved that it was easy walk distance to the town square, and there was a very well appointed grocery store no more than 400 yards from the house. We will be staying here again when we return to Gettysburg (1.5 days is not enough; the location needs 3-4 days)."

We ended up getting take out and spent the evening with them and a friend of theirs(sorry, I’m not sure of the spelling of the friend’s name). It was a lovely night of just talking and sharing stories of our journey and vice versa. Their home is gorgeous! Such a lovely, warm atmosphere. The decor is beautifully and thoughtfully done. They have a very sweet and handsome dog named Boris. Got along very well with our little maltipoo.
There is so much I could write but not enough space! So I will end with this. In your travels you meet a lot of people. I believe meeting Brian and Petra was kismet. We will definitely stay in touch with this beautiful couple! 10/10"

The whole house was spotlessly clean. The fenced-in backyard was convenient for our daschunds and provides a beautiful view of the sunset. The location couldn't be better.

The home was beautiful and immaculately clean! Although the location wasn’t directly downtown we thought it was perfect, only a few blocks past seminary ridge. As for Brian and Petra, you couldn’t possibly ask for better hosts. Within a day they felt like they were close personal friends instead of hosts. I brought our dog because we had no other choice. This already made me very self conscious! Not only did they make us feel comfortable but insisted on us leaving our dog with them instead of our room!!! I wish I could put into words just how wonderful our stay was and how very sweet Brian and Petra were! This is the ONLY place we will ever stay at in Gettysburg again. We are already looking forward to our next stay with them. To Brian and Petra a very heartfelt thank you from my wife and I who were going through a rough time."

Stayed with a pet","Petra and Brian are the best! They're both very friendly and communicative, I really enjoyed their hospitality and appreciated their thoughtfulness towards their guests. They really go out of their way to make you welcome and comfortable in their home.
The house is lovely and very cozy and extremely clean. It is a few minutes from the battlefield which is very convenient. It is also located in a very quiet neighborhood, I really enjoyed that as I was able to relax after a wonderful day exploring the battlefield and town.
I'm so happy to have found Petra and Brian's home as they have two rooms available so I will be able to rent them both when I return with my cousins and we can all stay together in one place. I will also stay longer the next time so I can get a nice long massage from Petra who is a massage therapist.
Overall, you really can't beat this place for hospitality, cleanliness, comfort, friendly and accommodating hosts and proximity to the battlefield."

We loved the outdoor deck - we spent a lot of time out there on our first night there because the weather was so gorgeous. Baltimore and Steinwehr Streets are right there, so shopping, ice cream, beverages and Bantam Coffee were within walking distance of our front door. This was a perfect place to stay for our weekend in Gettysburg!
Rod and Jen were accessible at all times. Rod met us at the house to give us the keys and had everything set for when we left. Rod and Jen are the consummate hosts!"

They have a nice area to eat outback if the weather is nice. A definite must see l, other than the National Park, is Gettysburg Museum of History. It’s free and right down the street from the apartment."

Stayed over a week","We found the accommodations very clean comfortable and in a good location. We had access to a washer and dryer, iron and ironing board as well as many other amenities. All the rooms except bathroom had a ceiling fan and all were well lit.
The bed we used was very comfortable. The bathroom had an abundance of towels, hand and wash cloths, hair dryer. The bathroom was a little small. A walk-in shower versus tub shower would have been more convenient. The living room had a nice size TV. Parking was in the back of the house. There was a nice yard with patio that had table, chairs, umbrella. Great for sitting outside in the evening listening to music coming from down the street. While there, we needed a door lock replaced. Rod answered our request in a short reasonable time and replaced the lock. He was kind and always available to answer any questions. The home was within walking distance of shops, restaurants, museums, and Culp’s Hill. Also, short driving distance from battlefields."

Stayed a few nights","Great apartment right in the town of Gettysburg! My family and I stayed for a long weekend and it was just right for us. The apartment is the first floor in a designated historic civil war home, and in walking distance to many restaurants & shops in the town. There are sections of the National Park which are immediately nearby to walk to, although to get to the Visitor's center (about 2 miles away) we drove. This was no problem because the apartment has off-street parking in the back, one in a garage and another adjacent to it. Also, it has a very nice deck in the back where we typically hung out in the evenings after our long days of walking throughout the park and through the town."

He is very nice and told us a little bit about the history of the house. He told us we could call him if we had any problems or needed any information about the town. If the weather is nice there is a very nice deck and back yard to relax in. One bedroom did not have a closet, but there was a large cupboard for storing your clothes. The air conditioner is only in the living room so it can get warm in the bedrooms, but each room has a ceiling fan which helps. Also, since it is on a main street through town, there is a lot of traffic noise, especially early in the morning. We found all the supplies we needed in the kitchen and bathroom with plenty of towels, wash cloths, and paper supplies. We had a nice time and would stay there again if we were in the area."

Stayed a few nights","The location is perfect. Just a short walk will bring you to the city center one way or the battlefields in the other. The fact that the house sits on the Baltimore St does mean that you'll have to deal with continuous road noise, but the convenience to everything makes up for it. The house is very clean, nicely decorated, cozy and showcases a touch of modern with some older/original features. There is only a single bathroom so probably not recommended for more than 4 people. The host is local which makes for convenience if you have questions or issues as well as being able to provide some personal history of their family. We will definitely make this a top consideration for future stays."

We could not have been happier with the amenities in the Red Door house, and overall ease of the experience. Rod was a great host with vast knowledge on the Battle and the town.

My baby was a new crawler and I felt very comfortable with him crawling around :) Other reviewers mention that it is on a main street and this is clear from the description as well. I am a light sleeper and needed earplugs but my relatives and baby had no issues with the noise. Rod was flexible about meeting me at the apartment to check in. He was friendly and informative about the history of the building and the area surrounding it.

A lot of personality, and wouldnt doubt some ghosts! Located in a great spot, there was a ton to do around that is walking distance of the house. Theres a nice little museum right beside it, too. Instructions to get in the garage were easy, sadly the company vehicle we were in was too tall for it. Entry to the house was easy as well with the code to the door and then keys to the other upon entry. I love the layouts of these old houses and stsying in this one made you feel you were apart of history. Especially given the town its in. The stay was a great experience and well worth it. I highly recommend this Airbnb if youre ever traveling to Gettysburg."

Suggest the Gettysburg battlefield tour bus along with the cyclorama and museum. Went to nearby outlet mall but not that great. We ate at Blue& Gray, the Pub and Mama Ventura.

Chris’s place is also comfortable and you will have everything you need. Chris made check-in easy and was very responsive. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the early evening, lots of hellos to folks walking by, and liked the quiet garden in the backyard in the mornings for coffee time. The procession to the Gettysburg National Cemetery where Lincoln gave his address in 1863 went directly in front of the property where this home was built soon after, around 1866. Special. We had a great stay! Highly recommend."

The backyard had some beautiful flowers in it but could use a bit more work, once the weather allows. Having a garage to park our car in was awesome! Very cool to be so close the history surrounding the battle...the Shriver House and Museum is right next door and a must see. Chris was very responsive to our question, as soon as we arrived, about the door lock system. It was nice that check out time was 12:00 p.m.; every Air BnB should do that! The only challenge we had was regulating the temperature for the rooms where there was an air conditioner, as it was a brutally hot and humid weekend. We should have asked Chris for instructions but decided that they were cooling just enough for our short visit. Overall we really enjoyed our stay!
Thanks Chris!"

One of the beds is in the area where the dining room would be, but it has doors on both sides and the bed is super comfy. The tub in the shower is enormous! Would be great for kids bath time or for a nice soak after a long day of sight seeing. Location is right in the main area near many shops and restaurants. We were at the college for a reunion and it was a nice walk to campus. Air conditioning was good (it was in the 90's!). The backyard is a lovely place to have morning coffee. It is filled with fragrant flowers that attract a lot of bees, so some people might not like that so much, but it didn't bother us. The street is pretty busy during the day but very quiet at night. No trouble sleeping for any of us!"

This was by far it was by far the best place I have ever stayed. It is clean , beautifully decorated, comma and well stocked. However that's not what makes it great. The period style of the house and the ""ground zero"" location brought our Gettysburg trip alive. I will be staying here again. I also cannot stress enough that if you care about the Civil War or you are a reanactor, you should stay here. You can take a step back in time here."

Stayed with kids","This is a 19th Century house - the floors and plaster and some of the fixtures (though electrified) are original, and the furnishings appear to all be either authentic to the period, or at least compatible. The kitchen is modern. The bathroom is updated. The yard is small, but private, with a shelter and a table to enjoy a quiet meal. The garage is large, and we kept the hitch carrier there. We met Chris when he trimmed the grass, but while available, he was not at all obtrusive, and we had privacy and very convenient location. We really appreciated this place. Great atmosphere and updated in a thoughtful way. Chris is a great host. We had everything we needed."

Quiet and cozy, the house allowed us to cook when we wanted, bring home leftovers for reheating, pop in for a couple of hours of rest in the middle of warm days, and just be relaxed during our entire time there.

Stayed a few nights","This house is a great spot to stay in while visiting Gettysburg. It is exactly as posted. The location is great, you can walk to town and to some of the battlefield sites. Off street parking, washer dryer, coffee and toiletries, comfy beds. We were able to cook and hang out with friends and our child at the college. Look forward to visiting again."
