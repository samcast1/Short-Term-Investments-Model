She responded to any of my questions which I appreciated. I definitely would stay here when I come back. It’s not far from anything. You can take a five minute car ride and ur next to downtown to shop or grab a bite to eat. The neighborhood is great.

The extra doors separating the living room from the dining room were especially helpful as one family would wake up earlier than the other but the sound was blocked.

Stayed a few nights","Susan's cottage was like a slice of home. We were in town for a wedding and it was so nice to feel like we were a part of the cozy neighborhood rather than in a hotel. The house is a historic home that is lovely, well kept and very comfortable. It truly felt like visiting and staying with family. Susan was so kind and responsive, even helping with a quick alteration need. The neighbor's cat, Bean, visited every day and was a special treat. Overall, we can't wait to visit again and stay at the cottage!"

Stayed one night","Our stay was quiet which is what we were looking for. It was very relaxing. Susan was so easy to communicate with which is important. She was ‘very’ accommodating!!! Thank you Susan!!❣️. I have rented this place twice and have walked away with alittle disappointment and also some excitement. The space is in need of some better prepping for guests. I would love to come in and help ! It would be so much fun to get in there and make some minor but necessary changes. . There is great potiental to make the space more pleasing for guests. As a guest I might not revist because of some of the things that need attention, but overall, it was super relaxing!!! Would love to talk to you Susan. The location is great for getting around St. point and Plover area."

So much better than bunking up in a double queen hotel. Quaint neighborhood in town and walking distance to a ice cream shop which is always a plus! Plenty of literature available of things to do in the area. Loved the walk thru Stevens Point Sculpture Park. Great stay. Great host. No complaints!"

Stayed one night","Loved staying in Susan's home! It felt comfortable from the moment we walked in and felt like we were visiting a friend with how welcoming we felt. The space was the perfect size for the two of us and our college bound teen. - we all had the privacy we needed and especially liked the pocket doors to allow for even more quiet.
Very clean and everything we needed was at our fingertips.
We were able to cook and play games and really relax like we had hoped - a nice mini vacation! We hope to frequent this space in the future if our daughter selects UW- Steven's Point for college. Highly recommend this place to others! Joanne and Fred"

Stayed a few nights","Susan,
Our entire stay at your historic and comfortable house was perfect ! I would recommend it to anyone who needs a getaway to Stevens Point. There are so many advantages over a hotel room. It is walkable to many things in town, it is a lovely, well cared for home that suits the needs of an individual, couple or small family. The use of your kitchen is such a plus, as it the backyard patio and front porch. The neighborhood is inviting, warm and quite charming with an array of interesting homes of the period. To anyone interested in solar energy or environmental impact, your solar application is a strong pull. I love the fact you are committed to making a difference ! Thanks for everything !"

Stayed a few nights","This stay was priced right and it was a great fit for what we were looking for. We were in town for a two night event and were looking for a full house to ourselves, a place to eat a few meals and comfortable areas to spend limited hours lounging. The house exceeded our expectations.
The kitchen is dated with mismatched amenities, but it was clean and had everything we needed. The bathroom had mismatched linens, but was clean and met our needs. The mattresses were not the best (but acceptable) and the bedrooms lacked outlets, but everything was clean.
The window air conditioner adequately cooled the entire house. It had a nice patio, a great porch and comfortable seating.
If you are looking for a updated quaint old house to yourself with modern and matching amenities, you will be underwhelmed here, but you will have saved significantly. If you are looking for a clean, quaint old house that meets basic needs at a great price, this house is great. We enjoyed our stay and will likely stay again."

This room is close to the family's living and kitchen area, and the pooches are part of that. Owners were pretty good about controlling them, but if you're dog shy, might want to try for the basement apartment that's more private. Overall, good stay, and I would definitely return again."

The town is cute and had a few restaurants in walking distance and a great little gift shop just a couple of doors down from the flatlet. Unfortunately we didn't get to experience any baking happening downstairs, which was a little bit of a bummer but it was still exciting to see down into the kitchen.

We loved the little Village of Amherst. Just a hop, skip and jump from the flatlet is a nice park and beautiful waterfall off the dam. We also ventured a few miles away to Waupaca for some fun antique store shopping and fine dining.
Only one warning for the guests of the flatlet: ""You cannot buy just one item of bakery-that one item will keep you going back for more!
What a great time we had staying at the Tiny Town Bakery Flatlet!"

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the cutest airbnbs I've ever seen. There's a window over the bakery where you can watch the happenings. It wasn't open when I was there, but I bet it's cool. From the restored room to the comfy bed to the attention to details, the small room apartment is great. You also have access to the small commercial space after hours if you want to work on the lap top. You are in walking distance of a bar (across the street) and coffee shop (kitty corner). They also washed the sheets in unscented detergentfor me. Very nice people. One thing to note, if you're sensitive to traffic noise, keep in mind that it's on main street and an intersection. I'm used to dark silent nights where I live. But if you're not a light sleeper and you're out and about on the town yourself, it's probably not a problem. They provide ear plugs. Give the place a try."

Amy went above and beyond to bake us a carrot cake in advance of our arrival and had it sent up to our room on arrival. The whole town is like stepping back in a bygone era. The beautiful lake and dam across the road, restaurants and Central Waters Brewery right in town!! This is a great stay for a couple for a night or a week. Eric & Nancy"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Amy’s place to attend a weekend wedding. Her place is so cute and cozy. The bakery is only open a few days during the week and since we stayed over the weekend we did not experience an active bakery, but did get to briefly talk with Amy. It was the perfect amount of space for us and our dog. Amy left us some yummy baked goods to try and they were absolutely delicious. There’s a cute Irish pub across the street and a cafe with great coffee/breakfast options. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night",Okay - I loved it here. It was perfect for me for a solo night - to treat myself to absolutely charming accommodations in a surprisingly adorable small town. These are my favorites - places in a thriving little downtown - where I simply have to walk downstairs to explore. This is definitely a place I will return. It would be great for a couple too… I just don’t happen to have a significant other. Trust me when I say it just feels good here. I wish I could have stayed longer. I will go again- if she will have me!!!

Stayed one night","What a lovely little place in a sweet town. I'm a small town person and also a baker so was curious about what it'd be like to stay above a bakery. It was wonderful. The bakers were making scones at 9pm and now and then I would look out the window to the floor below to see the process. Btw, the scones are outstanding--there was one waiting for me when I arrived and it was a work of art. The room is cozy and had everything I needed; fridge, coffee maker, comfy reading chair and good lighting to work by. I highly recommend this place and especially if you want to explore the central part of the state and want an unusual setting such as over the bakery. Lots of thoughtful touches throughout the entire setting."

Stayed one night","For a girl's night away, Amy's place was absolutely fabulous! Do keep in mind that you will be staying above a working bakery so you WILL hear the noise from below as well as the kitchen. Amy made sure that we understood that Tuesday night is baking night, so she was in-house all night preparing yummy baked goods for the next day. She leaves earplugs for guests to use for sleeping purposes. The flatlet is absolutely adorable and very comfortable. Everything was clean and she left some fabulous lavender cookies for us to try! Amy is extremely kind and easy to work with...I would not hesitate to book with her again!"

It was our anniversary and she surprised us with a special gift upon our arrival. Many sweet and thoughtful touches (fresh flowers, local coffee pods, and chilled water in the awesome retro fridge) made us feel right at home. The location, being above a bakery, was so fun too! The bakery wasn’t up and running when we were there but we could see where all the baking magic happens through a window in our room. Local restaurants and coffee, kitty corner from our place, made for easy walking destinations. Oh! And we brought our kayaks and were able to put them in a block from the Flatlet on the Tomorrow River! We might have to make this trip again :) Thank you for making our stay one of the best, Amy!"

She refunded us back for the days we’re weren’t going to be there. She helped up with any questions we had. I recommend this Airbnb. Great place and Felicia is wonderful.

Air conditioning was not installed and the room gets very warm in the afternoon. We slept with the door & window open and had the ceiling fan on.
Parking is an issue as you alternate which side of the street to park on. The host told us the wrong side and we got a parking ticket. The city has no parking signs to inform you of the parking laws. I suggest check with the Stevens Point Police Department concerning the parking laws to avoid getting a ticket. Very disappointed and not worth the money."

No instructions given for key codes on site reservation info so I had to make calls and wait in car. Door code was 9 digits long so impossible to remember. Checkout was earlier than normal for some reason, I assumed 11 am like every other Air BnB. Repair man knocked at 845 to measure the blinds, I was not dressed yet. Very awkward and he didn’t speak English. Then the Maid walked in without knocking at 1025 due to the silly 10 am checkout. Disappointing service issues but cute place,"

Stayed with a pet","Property was as described, clean, and in a good location, close to downtown and UWSP. Also pet friendly, which was very much appreciated! The house has no yard, so you will have to walk your dogs around the block. Neighborhood was quiet, and we were able to park off-street in the driveway.
Favorite find: The Stevens Point Sculpture Park and Brickyard trails. The trails are pet friendly, too!"

I personally was grateful for the laundry room stocked with detergent. I came home with no laundry. My daughter and I also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood every morning with trips to Metro Market. We hope it will be available again next year for our annual trip to Stevens Point."

Stayed with kids","After a long day, I arrived later than expected and was having difficulty with entry when the owner popped up on the app with a solution. This was my first time utilizing AirBNB, and if every unit is like this one I will never use a hotel again. If you're a visiting UW-SP family, I cannot recommend this unit enough. On a trip to visit my soon-to-be graduating senior, I planned to make my famous pasta and salad so we could have a family dinner with her sister visiting as well from another UW school. Except, I forgot one very important thing. Not to worry though, this place had all the basics and then some. Ha! Olive Oil. They had olive oil! Pasta sauce and salad a success! Very close to the school, pet friendly, easy-access parking, very clean, cozy and well-furnished. Colors and decor are calming and cozy. The second bath and extra sleeping space was super useful with 3 daughters getting ready at one time.. We had a family health event while visiting, but the coziness and that I truly had a home away from home. Thank you again for a great stay!"

The space was perfectly clean and very well done. Soft comfortable carpet such that it did not feel like we were in a basement. The queen beds were harder than is our preference, and the mini fridge was very small, but except for those small things, everything was very good. Great, convenient neighborhood with a playground a block away and walking trails and a great frisbee golf course very close if you go in warmer weather."

Stayed with kids","The stay was AMAZING. Felt right at home, cozy and comfortable. Despite small things such as the face of a drawer that wasn’t connected to the drawer or very small other miscellaneous things, I hope we don’t get charged for things that others might have damaged or if it came that way. Also we could hear footsteps early mornings and no later than midnight, which didn’t cause any issues because that is expected when we are downstairs from people(Just a heads up for new guests). For the price of the stay here is way less expensive and WAY better experience/space than purchasing a stay at hotels in the nearby area. This location was the best and cleanest I’ve seen in the area. The living space was large and super comfortable, had plenty extra soft blankets and pillows, beds were extremely comfortable and my family loved it. Overall, the stay was CLEAN and IMMACULATE. Jennifer was amazing with communication and I definitely recommend Jennifer. DO NOT HESITATE, just BOOK! Will be back soon!"

We were able to have privacy with 2 bedrooms having distance between them. We enjoyed the ping pong table, the nice television, and enjoyed playing games and eating at the large table. Even though there was not a kitchen, the fridge, microwave and Keurig were sufficient for our brief stay. We would recommend this to others and the price was extremely reasonable. Safe, secure, private, clean, and close to everything we needed. Great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Jennifer's place during a particularly heavy snow storm, commuting back and forth (a ten-minute trip) from a meeting at the conference center. Jennifer went above and beyond by brushing the snow off my car in the morning and allowing for a late check-out. As pictured, the apartment was spotless throughout, with plenty of hot water in the shower, and a very comfortable bed."

Hard to be away from home a few days with kids without a way to cook. Insanely comfortable beds, the kids LOVED ping pong. Upstairs alarms woke the kids early but they’re early risers as it is so it wasn’t a big issue. Overall, I would go back if we needed to be away from the house for a few days! The layout/sleeping situation was PERFECT for our two adults and four kids."

Stayed a few nights","While staying at Jennifer’s, I experienced amazing sleep. I’m not sure if it was the half basement creating a special silence or the comfortable mattress, the perfect pillows, and the soft sheets, but my five-night stay left me rested and rejuvenated.
Add to that, a great shower, soft fluffy towels, and a Keurig coffee maker, and it’s a perfect place to stay. I will try and book here each time I return to Point to visit my mom. It’s one of the best places I have stayed in the area.
One special moment was when I went out to my car after a snowstorm and all the snow had been removed from my car. I smiled all day thinking about that.
The only downside was the minus-degree weather didn’t allow me to hike around outside, but I will definitely explore when I return. Obviously, Jennifer has no control over the weather."

Stayed with kids","My teenage daughter and I stayed for 5 nights (Sunday through Thursday night) so she could attend a soccer camp in Steven's Point while I worked remotely. The pros were the natural forest and farmland surroundings and the proximity to the main areas of Steven's Point (5 min drive). The cons were the sofa bed was slanted so hard for my daughter to sleep on, the wi-fi did not work for a whole day, there was some noise during the day as residents of the main house used the garage (as the unit is located in the attic area of a detached garage), and the host is requesting an additional $60 cleaning fee to be paid one week after we left because we did not follow a check out procedure regarding garbage communicated to us the morning of check out (which were not able to complete since we had already left the property and started traveling home by that time). I will be finding other accommodations next time we have to stay in Steven's Point."

I spent quite a bit of time at Standing Rocks for MTB and used the Tomorrow River Trail for gravel riding. The location was nice and quiet and I was able to keep my bikes out of the rain by the garage during a rain storm. The kitchen area was small but adequate if you choose to make some meals for yourself.
A couple items to note
- Internet was spotty - good enough to check email or look for restaurants but might not work if you are trying to work remotely and kept pausing my YouTube videos
- Note that the place is accessible from outdoor stairs on the second floor and the bathroom is downstairs accessible from indoor stairs ( not a negative but just to be aware if you are not able to use stairs very well).
Overall, it was very comfortable and a great location for the activities I wanted to do."

Only downside was the multiple steps to get into the house - a little confusing at first since the garage door was broken, but we figured it out. The parking pad was a bit tight for a large vehicle, but overall, parking was good. A lower car might scrape a little bit getting out of the garage. Thanks, EMILY!"

Stayed a few nights","There's a lot to like about this historic house. It's huge, for starters, with a lot of spaces for people to enjoy. The place was well-furnished (though we didn't use the kitchen much, so I can't comment on that). The beds were really comfortable and the linens were nicer than usual for an Airbnb.
But there were also several signs of lapsed maintenance that I didn't expect. The upstairs bathroom door didn't properly latch closed and the shower had a lot of mildew stains in it. The rugs had a lot of stains. And there were many instances of peeling paint throughout the rooms, especially on doors and trim. It's like someone is managing day-to-day cleaning but no one is paying attention to the larger maintenance needs.
The garage and parking pad can accommodate two cars total (which was all we had). Street parking seemed really restricted, so if your group will have more than two cars you should get details from the host in advance about where you can park them."

Group trip","We were once again lucky enough to have this wonderful house for another year of trivia and it was, again, just as great as it always has been.
A nice gift welcome basket waited for us at the house, along with immaculate facilities. The linens were clean and comfortable and plenty of incidentals were available.
The kitchen is well stocked (there's paprika in the cabinet, no need to buy more!) with plenty of pots and pans to do any cooking.
It is a long drive for me every year to get to Steven's Point but the moment I step into the house, the stress and tension of the drive just melts away.
Emily herself has been immensely kind to us year after year and we could not be more grateful to her. It is really from all of us at Trivial Fursuit that we give her our endless gratitude."

The house was extremely well taken care of and we felt at home as soon as we walked through the door. Emily was proactive and gave us great directions on how to find the house and to get access. With our oldest attending the University in the fall I'm sure this will be the first of many times we stay at this place."

Group trip","Emily’s place was perfect for our week away visiting our friends for their wedding.
Had all the little amenities that you would expect to have in own home, down to plastic wrap and aluminum foil.
Especially happy that there was an iron and ironing board, making sure we looked slick for the wedding.
Sunroom was nice for having a coffee after a long night.
Close enough to walk home from the bar, or go for a nice walk to Schmeekle nature reserve.
This over 100 year old house is relatively well maintained with a couple drywall patches showing, but other than that it creaks with character.
Would stay again if I plan another group trip to Stevens point!
Ps our F-150 super crew short box just barely fit in the garage, but it fit! 6.5 ft box might be too much."

There were 4 of us so it was plenty big. The kitchen had all the amenities we needed to make our own meals. The towels for our showers were nice and fluffy and there was soap, shampoo and conditioner if you would need it. There was plenty of paper towel, toilet paper and Kleenex. The beds were very comfortable with extra pillows or blankets in the closets should you need them. We appreciated being able to park in the garage. Yes, the house is on a busy street so you will hear traffic. The house is within walking distance of UW Stevens Point. We enjoyed taking a stroll around the campus since most college kids had gone home for the summer. Thank you Emily for opening your home to guests. And, for anyone traveling to Stevens Point, make sure you check out Belt's Ice Cream before you leave as well!"

Group trip","We've stayed at this house every year for 90FM Trivia until 2020 - we all know what happened - but Emily was incredibly gracious, understanding, kind, and helpful in rescheduling our stay multiple times as the situation changed, whether it was to October when everyone thought it might be over, to 2021 when we again hoped it would be over but wasn't quite yet, and finally to 2022 when we were at last able to make good on our reservation. She stayed in touch the whole time to make sure of our plans and intentions.
We are all, once again, so grateful to Emily and her family for this wonderful house as well as to Jamie, the caretaker, for making sure it's always in such wonderful condition. We could only be so lucky to continue to be able to use the house until the end of the contest (aka the heat death of the universe)."

There were so many extras and high quality amenities, we were very impressed with the outfitting. It was, of course, spotless and in a convenient location, and although on a busy road we really didn’t notice the noise. Although we didn’t travel with children, I’m a mom if younger children and was so pleased with the coloring sheets they left out, as well as an entire room on the main living level with toys and a comfortable couch. I’m actively brainstorming an excuse to stay here again!"

Group trip","What do you get when you combine an early 20th century classic with all the amenities one could need in a vacation rental? You get Emily's home in Stevens Point, WI. Stepping into this historic home is like entering another world where craftsmen used the surrounding timber to construct masterpiece domiciles. Everything from built in bookshelves to finely designed arched entry ways echo back to a different time. That being said, such things as central air conditioning and up to date kitchen appliances make for some very modern conveniences. It seemed like every time we needed something, it was there: That special kitchen utensil , an outdoor grill (with charcoal), condiments, blender...One can tell the owners occasionally live there because the home lacks nothing. It almost felt like we were staying at a friends house. The location is perfect for getting around the campus, or enjoying the charming downtown including a thriving Farmers Market. All in all, I highly recommend this rental for anyone who is staying in the area. It was an experience we will likely never forget.

Stayed about a week","Emily's house is spacious and charming. We enjoyed our stay and had everything we needed in the kitchen. The fireplace was pleasant. The owners kindly gave us permission to bring our dog. Do note that the house is lightly furnished, so you won't find a desk to work at or comfortable chairs in the two smaller bedrooms. My college-age son and I were studying and working from home, so this was inconvenient, but it might not be a concern for vacationers. The street in front is busy, an issue if you have children or are sensitive to noise. The tub in the downstairs bathroom (not pictured) is crudely installed (blogs of caulk, low-end wall panels), which was dispiriting. After we checked out, the out-of-town owner sent photos the manager took of the couch, saying that it was stained, and asking for a $150 cleaning fee. Although I paid the fee, I feel sure the stains pre-dated us. We spilled nothing and kept the couches covered with blankets. The manager also reported to the out-of-town owner that I failed to return one pair of keys--also puzzling because I left both pairs on the table as instructed. My recommendation: If you are considering staying here, ask if the bathroom has been updated. And take photos of the furniture and even of the keys you leave on the table, so you have proof (even if just for your own peace of mind)."

The home was very clean, beds were super comfortable, upstairs shower was perfect (great water pressure and plenty of hot water), and the master suite was cozy and inviting. We enjoyed the patio for playing games, the basement for running around, and my boys enjoyed the bunk beds and toy room.
We all enjoyed a socially distant stay which included lots of bike riding on the Green Circle Trail and renting a canoe on Lake Joanis at Schmeekle Reserve. Thanks for giving us a wonderful home environment so our family could have a safe and fun vacation during COVID-19!"

Group trip","We stayed in Emily's house because we were hosting a bridal party ""cook-out"" at Iverson Park. It was a wonderful place to stage our activities from. The pictures don't do the house justice--everything is better than the pictures! We especially loved the living room, huge table in the dining room, and the huge refridgerator in the kitchen (which we needed to store food for the party). The house was very clean, and plenty of towels were to be had. The house itself was built in the early 1900's, so had plenty of charm to spare. Emily was very responsive, and even was pro-active about telling me how to get into the house. We enjoyed staying in her house and would highly recommend her house to anyone staying in Stevens Point."

Dawn, the caretaker, keeps the house immaculate and well-stocked. Once again, someone-who-shall-remain-unnamed left something at the house and Dawn was very quick to let us know and arrange for its return.
Emily has always been so supportive of our team before and this year is no exception. It's always a joy to hear from her about trivia and our team, and she is always quick to answer any questions.
We are incredibly lucky to be able to stay in this wonderful house for Trivia and so grateful to Emily, her family, and Dawn and her husband. Thank you all so much for making trivia that much more special!

Group trip","I rented this home for my visiting family instead of everyone being stuffed into a hotel and it was perfect! The large dining room and living room were wonderful for big family meals and game night.
It’s a beautiful big old house that reminds me of my grandparents’. Unfortunately I think we stayed during the coldest week in January; being that it’s a big old house the upstairs rooms were quite toasty but the main floor was a little chilly. Thankfully they had plenty of throw blankets in the living room and that was the perfect fix. We should have built a fire in the fireplace; we missed out there and it’s my one regret from the stay. I definitely recommend staying here with a large and boisterous family! It was perfect."

Place was as described and price was good, but I will say the neighborhood was pretty noisy on the weekend we stayed there, so if you’re looking for somewhere quiet this might not be the spot.
Other than that, the place has easy parking, quick access to main roads, and was exactly what we needed for a quick weekend in Stevens Point!"

- Easy to use lock/ security with clear instructions
- Comfortable firm bed with variety of pillows

- Good AC and sound system
- Has a cool, trendy urban clean feel
- White noise app and sleep mask is advisable for any traveler in any hotel or Airbnb. The morning sound from cafe wasn't a big deal if you planned for it. I personally liked it!

Stayed with kids","I stayed in Deanna’s place for a week with my 2 kids (9 and 13) while we attended a conference at UWSP. The apartment is very spacious, looks just like the photos, and had just about everything we needed. It is also less than 5 minutes from UWSP by car which was important to us. My kids enjoyed the “big bunk beds” and I was glad to have a washer and dryer. As noted in the description of the unit, there is a bit of early morning noise from the cafe downstairs, but we found that using the white noise app on our phones/iPads drowned it out and it wasn’t an issue. The only negative for me was the queen sized bed which is VERY firm. There is a pad in the closet and I could have put that on the bed, but I found I was too tired in the evenings to deal with it. All in all, our stay was great and I would stay there again."

Easily accommodated our family of four with more than enough seating. Queen sized bunk beds are a great touch as well.
Can't beat the location as it's walking distance to do many things including restaurants, the children's museum, shopping, the farmers market, and the riverfront.
The only slight down side was the music coming from the Cafe downstairs at 6:15am. It was not super loud, but still kind of annoying."

Stayed with kids","Pros:
- Very nice hosts. Gave a lot of information prior to our trip which was very helpful.
- Rubys restaurant below had awesome food and coffee. Loved that they prioritized local food.
- Good apartment layout.
- Close to the library and other restaurants.
Cons:
- This could just be me because I live in the country with no city noises/lights, but the street lights illuminated the rooms during the night. It was really hard for me and my kids to sleep because of it. The rooms have blinds but they didn’t block light.
- Rubys opens at 7am but the staff get there earlier and started playing music around 6/6:20am. You can hear it in the middle bedroom. We were already awake, but I can see that bothering some people.
- Might be a little nitpicky, but the sheets were very scratchy and were washed in tide or all detergent. Recommend bringing your own sheets and pillows."

Great place for a family or friends. The separate rooms and large bathroom are perfect. Coffee shop downstairs was delicious and we ordered online easily. Had a great time and we will definitely be back!"

Stevens Point is a great little town with good food, bars with darts and pool tables, and a beautiful lake. You are literally a 30 minute drive from Granite Peak Ski Resort. The Ruby is a unique coffee shop right below the apartment with a private entrance from the apartment. I will definitely stay again if available."

Stayed a few nights","Overall good location. Close to a lot of bars and restaurants. We were there to ski at granite peak and this was an easy location.
We were very disappointed with the queen mattress…it was very uncomfortable. We didn’t utilize the twin beds so I can’t speak for those. Additionally, I’m not sure if this happens frequently or it was just a one off instance, but we were woken up at 6AM by music blaring from the restaurant below the Airbnb. Unfortunately this went on for an hour until the restaurant opened. Other than the fact that we didn’t get great sleep, we had a good stay."
