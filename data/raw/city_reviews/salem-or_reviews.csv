I was a little scared about the shared bathroom but it was so clean and worked out so well because you only share it with one other room. Like the other reviews said, the bed was so comfy. Also the location is perfect as it is so close to downtown where all the restaurants and stuff are! This room was a steal!"

Stayed a few nights","The photos in the listing don't do justice to the charming room I stayed in. Jennifer has added some furnishings, such as a vintage dresser at the foot of the bed, that really make the space more cozy and comfortable. There is now a little desk in the nook that features a window overlooking the street. In early March, the tall camellias were already blooming outside the other window. One morning, I was able to enjoy a walk in the park that's only a couple blocks away. All in all, it was a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","What I really appreciated about Jennifer's place was the comfortable bed. I have never stayed in an Airbnb with a bed that was actually great, but this one was amazing. Also, the other guests and the neighborhood itself were extremely quiet. Jennifer was very communicative and friendly. Something to note-- if you have a bigger vehicle (I don't), be aware that the street is narrow and twisty right where the house is. I chose this listing simply because it was close to my workplace and reasonably priced. I would say this setup might be best suited for those who don't mind interacting with other guests, though Jennifer honored my wishes and informed the other guests that I wanted to keep to myself. Overall this was an excellent value, super clean, and very comfortable."

The room was very clean and welcoming. When I arrived the other occupants in the home we’re also very welcoming, and they knew that I was there for my race and asked me how it was going. It was nice to feel expected and to have the other occupants know who I was and why I was there.
I would highly recommend this state, anybody who is visiting the local Salem area."

you get so much for the value of what you get for what you're spending. I love the room I was staying in the bed is very comfortable, I truly enjoyed having my privacy. And even though I shared a bathroom with another Airbnb guest it didn't feel like I was sharing it with anyone at all. Beautiful house, with a whole lot of amenities at your fingertips! my room is very private and I needed a two-day rest from a long work week as many hours and that's exactly what I got! Thank you so much Jennifer! I will stay here again and again. Very clean & Tidy and Wonderful host!!"

Stayed over a week","Just what I needed.....I had been living in Salem for 3 months while working at Salem Health and had one more month to go. While the initial hosts (not an airbnb) were nice the living conditions were not. I rented from these airbnb hosts for the last month I was in Salem and it was wonderful. The hosts are super nice, quick to respond, and always available for any needs. As my month was ending, I felt more like I was staying with friends and in their warm welcoming home. Highly recommend if you are visiting Salem or if working at Salem Health as it's a very close and in walking distance."

The home was clean, modern and my room felt very private even though it was shared with the owners. Also, both of their dogs were so sweet and were always happy to see me when I walked through their space. Would for sure stay here again if the need arises."

The attention to detail in the decor and amenities was impressive. The bedroom was comfortable, and the entire space was spotless. Miranda clearly takes great pride in maintaining a clean and inviting environment for guests.
Communication with Miranda was smooth and efficient. They were quick to respond to any questions I had and provided clear instructions for check-in and check-out. It made the entire process stress-free. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Salem, and without a doubt, I'll be choosing Miranda's Airbnb again!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Starting with at Miranda’s place was exactly what I was looking for and ended up being so much more. I come to Salem for work and this place was perfect for me. I like renting rooms in houses because it feels a little less lonely than a private space. This was the perfect combination of having my own space and friendly hellos when we crossed paths. Miranda and her husband went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and at home and their two dogs were a joy to come home to after work. Great location, wonderful amenities, very clean, quiet as well. I will definitely stay here again 😀."

Miranda and Kyle were the best hosts we’ve ever experienced! They were welcoming and made us feel right at home. They were flexible with our check out time and we are beyond grateful for their generosity!
The bed was extremely comfortable. Their bonus room was super fun with video games and TV and a really comfy couch and we enjoyed watching a movie in.
We have our two month old with us, and they were so kind and generous to us and adjusted the heat for our baby to feel cozy. The whole house is really well taken care of, and very clean. They gave us great recommendations of things to do in the area. Their home is the perfect layout to spend time with my little family, it’s roomy and spacious and extremely well taken care of!"

Stayed over a week","This place's a good stay. It's a nice location with a nice bedroom and bathroom. Feel like it could be better, mostly things like hosts being more mindful of the shared space.
Some things to note:
- Hosts took a while (few days?) to clean dishes in the sink (some smell with the food left behind) and there's clutter I have to often move out to do my own cooking.
- I had to tell them to not run the laundry late at night (it was around midnight) or shut the door to suppress noise
- The parking can be really bad if you had to park in the spot mentioned in the airbnb. There had to be some back and forth for me to park on an easier spot near the garage, but I feel like it should have been the spot to start out with
- There are few times the dog can bark for a really long time if the hosts are not around. Fortunately it did not happen all the time, but one time it happened for 45 minutes
- I recall the host's husband was shirtless in the kitchen once lol"

Stayed one night","Hard to find a place at this price with a hot tub. Was working perfectly and looks out to a copse of trees, so that side is very secluded. Place was as described and very clean. Don't plan on cooking other than a microwave, there was a place BBQ placw just 8 min drive away that fixed that problem. If you have ANY mobility problems it might not be a good fit. The spiral stair is very tight fit and a bit wobbly. At the very affordable price I knew there would be trade offs though and overall was very happy with the stay."

Stayed a few nights","So I am not sure why anyone rated this anything other than 5. LOVED this. Beautiful surroundings, very quiet and a gorgeous view. You could stay there for 3 days and not leave. The place is immaculately clean and the whole design is extremely tasteful. The hot tub looks over a gorgeous forest and you can sit in it at night and watch the stars and occasional owl that flies by. The kitchen is minimalistic, do not plan to do a lot of cooking but has everything and LeAnne leaves you with a box of goodies and treats and water bottles (even though the tap water is perfect since it comes from an aquafer). Consider bringing some simple meals. Because it is in the middle of nature you have to drive a few minutes to get to for restaurants and stores but all very doable. If you are looking for a weekend of R and R and be close to a few natural parks and hikes (Silverfalls is 40 minutes drive) this is THE place to stay. LeAnne herself is amazing, kind and helpful."

Stayed one night","I'm honestly unsure how to rate our stay as we only stayed for one night. We really enjoyed the balcony view while sitting in the jacuzzi, and the first floor was very spacious. However, the spiral staircase upstairs will haunt my nightmares. Also, the handrails on the main staircase are broken, so I nearly fell. When I met the host in the morning, she said she was aware of the handrail issue and had informed her husband. However, he seems to be procrastinating, putting tenants at risk by neglecting the problem. She also mentioned reminding her husband. Well, that's that... nice."

The hot tub on the deck with the tress and peace/quiet was amazing. Very simple and exactly what we needed. I slept very deep (not always the case!) I really appreciated the 12 pm checkout. It is more realistic with the amount of time needed in the morning to relax, gather your things and still stay in vacation mode with out having to rush. The land surrounding the area is beautiful. I will def stay again."

Getting there, you drive through the country and get to see all the beautiful wineries that surround the area. It’s 10 -15 minutes from town which was great for us!

As a full-time caregiver, mother, sister, partner, friend, etc. I was reminded in order to be and do all these things for others, I must first take time for myself.

The hot tub was spotless and toasty. We soaked a few times during our short stay. I loved the high vaulted ceiling and the loft was very cozy. The kitchen literally had everything you need and more. Coffee, creamer, sugar, steel cut oats, chocolate, popcorn and water. There was even a toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom. I have never seen that at any place we have stayed.
Place was spotless and smelled amazing, the bed was ultra soft and cozy. I could have nuzzled up in there for much longer than we had time for.
Thank you for the last minute availability and the cozy place. Highly recommended."

The hot tub is perfect and all the considerate items in the kitchen really made it feel like the host cares. The narrow stairs up to the loft can be a little intimidating for someone with height and/or falling fears, but just take it slow! 😁
Bed is very soft, too soft for us, which I know isn’t the most controllable aspect."

This stay features a grand living and dining room for visiting and watching T.V, a comfortable bed, bathroom amenities and kitchen utensils that would be good for cooking a small meal.
We would recommend the Red Barn to anyone looking for hiking trails or wineries with a welcoming place to unwind when you return.
We will definitely keep this place in mind when we return to the area. Thank you LeAnne!"

The water supply tastes great and I am quite particular.
The hot tub is a total bonus! Enjoyed it very much!
Spiral stairs took me some careful negotiation but were interesting!
You can walk to Coria winery for a splendid view, and a flight, if you don’t mind uphill.
Happy to stay again!"

Easy to get to, just a short drive from the I-5. Also just 10 minutes to Salem downtown.
So quiet at night and in the mornings. Spacious interior. Great to relax in the hot tub.
LeAnne was a splendid and helpful host."

It does say refrigerator and mini fridge but there is only a mini fridge. The electric stove is a mini portable electric stove but if you travel light the house is amazing. Prior to check in we went to the winery up the road, it was one of the best winery’s I’ve ever been too. I had a great time couldn’t be more appreciative of the opportunity to stay !"

There’s designated parking right out front and a hot tub on a private deck for further relaxation. And, you can even walk just up the road to a local winery! We were so comfortable here."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time staying at LeAnne’s AirBnB. The location felt “off the beaten path,” but was a relatively short drive from Silver Falls State Park where we hiked during our stay, as well as downtown Salem where we went for dinner both nights of our stay (thanks to our host for the restaurant recommendations). It was clean, cozy, and private, and the hot tub was fantastic with a great view from the deck. A/C worked great, WiFi was easy to access, parking was simple, location was not hard to find, water quality was perfectly fine, and we had pretty much everything we needed in terms of amenities and then some (see the hot tub). And while there are many wineries in the area, the one just down the road has a really fantastic view."

My youngest daughter is autistic and doesn’t do well in hotels due to sensory issues with loud sounds. We didn’t think twice to book LeAnne’s place because we knew it was on private property and the area was quiet. The atmosphere was exactly what we needed to decompress after a long day. The hot tub was perfect, the view at night was beautiful. She was attentive with us and check in was very easy. The coffee was perfect, bathroom was clean and the the beds were comfortable. If you’re looking for a nice quiet place and you run into her place don’t think twice, just book it. We’re so grateful she was our host."

Upon entering the airbnb it had a clean fresh smell, not cleanser clean, but new house clean. The listing didn't describe how remote and private it was. But I was overjoyed to see that we would have our privacy. It was a quick drive from the freeway under 10 min. And a short drive to our favorite ice cream place in Lake Oswego Salt n Straw about 15 min. The only noise we heard was birds chirping. So peaceful! There were many snacks to nibble on: chocolates popcorn bottled water in the mini frig coffee teas and others. Just Perfect! The private hot tub in back the house was very relaxing."

The hot tub was a great place to stargaze from and the deck provided amazing views!

We originally planned to go on hikes, visit a winery and get dinner but the place was so cozy we didn’t step foot outside of the airbnb once we got settled in. LeAnne was also grade A helpful with anything we needed and kept the place looking top notch. The private hot tub on the balcony overlooking the tree’s was dreamy, we got to soak while it was raining with the help of the perfectly sized patio umbrella, also the loft vibes inside with the spiral staircase were immaculate. We cooked dinner, drank wine, listened to music, played games, soaked in the hot tub & took naps and it was perfect. We will definitely be booking again."

Kitchen had everything we needed, laundry and other appliances are top notch…it was very difficult to leave that stunning place ;)"

I came on a solo mom get-away and it was everything I'd hoped for. Secluded enough, with the most beautiful scenery, yet easy to access the city and surrounding areas. I highly recommend this spot to anyone, hopefully my husband and I can come back together, or it would be perfect for a laidback girl's weekend as well. Thanks again, Lillian, it was a wonderful stay."

We stayed one night, but the moment we walked in, we wished we had booked longer. We tried some of the local recommendations for restaurants and sights to see and highly recommend the next guests do the same. The home was private and cozy in the vineyard. I cannot speak more highly of this. We loved waking up to see the beautiful valley and vineyard before you! Not only that, but the place itself was fully stocked with every amenity you could think of - and I’m high maintenance! Everything a guest could want and more! I always go into these places expecting I’ll need to buy extra shampoo or bring my own snacks, but Lillian went above and beyond with this listing and I’ll be honest, it’s those little thoughtful gestures that made this feel like home. It quickly became our dream home away from home!"

The beds were super comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything you may need. They do have a washer/dryer on site - however it is a steam dryer, so don't wait until the last minute to do laundry before leaving. Short drive into town for coffee and restaurants and located not far from many local wineries. The little patio in the front has 2 rocking chairs, perfect for an early afternoon glass of wine and a visit from their dog Scooter. Would definitely stay here again and are already planning our next trip back!"

It was a great spot to stay in with our 16 month old son as there was plenty of space indoors and out and no nick nacks for him to mess with. :) We had a very minor hiccup during our stay and Lillian was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend.

Note for those needing wifi, the place comes with a mofi but it's not quite as strong as you might need for internet work/video calls.

The house itself is filled with natural light, impeccably designed, extremely comfortable, and located in the most relaxing setting among the vines on a very private property. The kitchen is well-equipped and we cooked ourselves the majority of the meals during our four night stay (just a heads-up that there is a stove-top but no oven). The shower was excellent and the bed very comfortable. It didn't effect us because we were there with the purpose of wine tasting and unplugging but the wifi was a little spotty at times.
I'm not kidding when I say that this is the only place we'll ever stay when we visit the Willamette Valley."

The bed and pillows were awesome. We kept all the doors and windows open when we were there, loving the inside/outside feeling. We cooked in and had cocktails on the porch in the rocking chairs. The house is on a short dead-end street, so it's quiet and peaceful. About five minutes away is a huge park along the Willamette River that is great for longer and more strenuous walking. Our host was so kind and attentive and we absolutely loved their dog, Scooter, who we coaxed into visiting us whenever possible. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for an annual convention and the place was awesome! I’d say the only downfall is there are no bathtubs. I have two toddlers who scream at the sight of showers lol. Of course, that is no fault of the owners, just my lack of reading. Otherwise, backyard was amazing for our kids to run around, fully fenced. There was a toddler bed provided and some toys in the house and outside. The house also has child locks on the cabinets! Besides the no baths, it is very toddler friendly, as there is not a lot of clutter for kids to get into. The hosts were very friendly and proactive in making sure we arrived and got in okay. As well as very responsive when I messaged them. House was clean and very spacious. And the neighborhood was nice! Definitely would recommend this place!"

And the artwork goes beyond what you see in the listing—the whole setting is enchanting, and yet it’s right in a lovely historic neighborhood, and close to town. The host, Mary Lou, was lovely, and so thoughtful, and a real gem, for giving the rest of us the opportunity to spend time in this tiny art gallery. If you’ve ever fantasized (as I have) about spending the night in an art museum, this may be as close as we’ll ever get!"

Stayed a few nights","I’m starting this review on my first day arriving for a 5 day stay because I already know I’m going to have a lot to say, and I don’t want to write a rushed review. I arrived on Easter Sunday. Mary Lou let me check in 2 hours before check in, even though they were totally doing family Easter in the main house. She walked me through the BEAUTIFUL garden to the guest house, and made sure I had everything I needed (including a plate of Easter Sunday lunch <3). I spent the next two hours walking around the neighborhood. I cannot express in words how gorgeous the neighborhood is. I took MANY photos :) I finished the evening on my personal patio, which conveniently sits perfectly in the sun all afternoon until practically sunset. Prefer the shade in the afternoon? Don’t worry, the garden bellow is filled with beautiful shrubs and flowers and comfortable seating. Not to mention the welded metal sculptures and other charming original pieces of art perfectly scatter throughout the foliage. Needless to say, I ended my first night in absolute heaven.
The following days were more of the same. Mary Lou periodically checked on me to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. As days passed, I discovered more tasteful and entertaining special touches. For example, I loved the small jar of color pencils and hardback sketch book for guests to fill with notes and sketches. Of course, I also took many more walks around the neighborhood and neighboring parks (yes multiple. And they’re ALL beautiful).
The apartment was stocked with complimentary snacks and breakfast items. Coffee and tea were also provided. I know this is going to sound strange...but the soap and shampoo was sooooooo nice. The bathroom is also stocked with soft fluffy towels and an array of personal hygiene items. This requires a great deal of attention to detail, but it makes a WORLD of a difference.
I could go on and on about how perfect this experience was for me, but I think I’ve made my point. Stop looking. Book this space. It’s comfortable, beautiful, and unforgettable. <3"

The loft is a gem and has everything you'd ever need, complete with snacks, coffee, tea, extra toiletry items, books, drawing pads and pencils, tv, radio, and a nice view. Her local recommendations for restaurants were spot on and her place is so conveniently located to every store we needed to go. Highly recommend!"

This art loft is a beautiful compilation of art and style. The personality of this space is so unique! We loved looking at all the art work. The magazines and books were fun! We had coffee, yogurt, granola and snacks which were so appreciated.

Stayed a few nights",Our daughter goes to Willamette in Salem and in the past we have stayed in one of the few hotels Salem offers. Never again. The loft exceeded our expectations and was less expensive than most hotel rooms in the area. It is well appointed and comfortable. The bedding was incredibly comfortable and the loft is filled with beautiful paintings. We found ourselves admiring the art often (it feels like a quaint gallery). The loft sits above their detached garage and is accessible from the alley behind their main house. It is private yet you have the benefit of having access to the beautiful backyard. This will be our go to place until our daughter graduates and we will certainly tell other parents about it.

Definitely check out the restaurants, they were So Good. There was also a cute little logbook where guests could leave notes and drawings for future guests to read. The loft was spotlessly clean, private, and air conditioned! The bed was comfy, there was a TV with Netflix, wifi, and extra of anything we might need. And to top it all off, Mary Lou and her husband were the nicest people ever! 10/10 would recommend staying here, it was the highlight of our trip."

Stayed a few nights","We had high hopes, but it was truly even better than I had expected. It was such a unique and interesting space-- something I always look for in an AirBnB. And nothing was sacrificed in terms of amenities and conveniences. We had our own separate parking area right at the loft. The way that the space fully functions as an art gallery and a comfortable living space, using these cool sliding walls, reminds me of some of the grand finales of those home makeover shows. It's just fun.
Mary Lou couldn't be a warmer host. And one night she and her husband happened to be having marionberry pie-- an Oregon specialty that we had never heard of. She warmed up two pieces and brought it over to us. We are not particularly fond of pies in general, but I'm telling you that this was the most amazing pie we had ever had. Not only that, but it introduced us to a cool local Oregon fruit that we wouldn't have gotten in any other state, but would likely have missed out on if not for Mary Lou!
The neighborhood is so beautiful-- every house different and so cool-looking. And located just a a few minutes from Willamette University.
I couldn't recommend more highly!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Mary Lou’s was fantastic. The loft was decorated with some amazing pieces of art and its layout was perfect. After each day’s adventures, it was so relaxing to come back and catch our breath. And it wasn’t just the loft, it was the entire neighborhood. Downstairs from the loft, there was a cozy outdoor “room” with a firepit, were we could sit and have a drink and go through the pictures of the day. Art was everywhere, from paintings to statues to mobiles….it was so comfortable and welcoming. Even looking out the windows, everyone in the area had these beautiful gardens and landscapes to brighten everything up. We were surrounded by gardens full of everything from roses to wildflowers. Every night, after coming back from our adventures, we would take time to simply walk around the block. The entire neighborhood had lots of little corner gardens with mixes of full blooms or bushes of blueberries and blackberries, huge trees, hidden pathways…. the neighborhood itself was almost a huge public park, where a walk down the sidewalk was one picture perfect setting after another.
Mary Lou is a fantastic host. She made sure we had coffee, snacks, sundries, and every other little thing that made the experience so wonderful. And if that wasn’t enough, on our last day, as we were packing our car to head out, she came out to say goodbye and give us a bag full of chocolate chip cookies she had made the night before.
I highly recommend if you are visiting Salem, check out Mary Lou’s wonderful place. It was a perfect launchpad for our visit to Oregon (where we travelled from the Coast to Silver Falls State Park to the Downtown Salem Saturday Farmers Market) with truly gracious hosts."

Check in was easy and smooth and Allan pointed out everything we needed to know about the apartment and the area which was helpful for us to find places to eat. The apartment itself was super clean and stylish with the beautiful artwork surrounding us. Everything in the apartment was easy to find and self explanatory to use. We will definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful loft and the hosts created special touches for the stay including a bottle of wine for the guests, breakfast food, and beautiful art on the walls. As an example of the hosts' attention to detail, they include a fan in the room in case a guest would like white noise in the background as they sleep. I appreciated that the hosts were also fine with me having my sister stay with me throughout my stay. The only thing that could be improved is the wifi - it was spotty in various places in the loft. I imagine this is because the loft is streaming from the house. That said, the still worked fairly well and the art on the walls and beauty of the loft itself made up for spotty wifi. I'd highly recommend this spot to other folks."

The bed was really comfortable and There was a desk where I could work and a well stocked kitchenette with snacks, coffee, fresh fruit and breakfast items. It was very quiet and parking was easy. Mary Lou and Alan were gracious hosts and made everything easy. The neighborhood is quiet but was close to everything I needed in downtown Salem. I've already made a reservation for another stay next monthand hope to always be able to stay here when I'm visiting Salem!"

Stayed a few nights","Ali and Eden's place was absolutely great, hands down one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. I had a decent change in plans the day of arrival, and went from checking in late in the evening to needing to check in early in the afternoon. They completely accommodated and were able to get the space ready hours early! Beyond that, I mentioned it was me and my wife's anniversary, and they even had a bottle of wine waiting for us! Everything else was great. Extremely clean, lots of supplies to do laundry or cook with, nice bathroom. This is the kind of place that can really make your visit to Salem that much better."

There was in-unit laundry which I didn't use but would be a great convenience to anyone staying longer.

My husband even remarked, as we entered the space, “this just looks exactly like you’d want an Air BnB to look!” While other Air BnBs may have provided unique experiences, this was by far the most full and professional accommodations we’ve ever stayed at.
This space had 100% private access and no need to see anyone else in the house.
Ali’s was always on top of her communication, giving us full instructions before we arrived as well as setting the expectation for our departure.
We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

My check-in was a breeze and we were so impressed by how nicely appointed the studio was, especially for the amazing price point. We were in town for a quick visit and it was so centrally located and easy to get downtown! We will definitely stay here again when we need to stay in town."

The entire home is beautifully decorated and is light, bright, and quite spacious. The kitchen is well-stocked and the bedding and bath linens are luxurious. The furniture is comfortable and provides plenty of seating, including a decent sized dining table for enjoying dinners in or playing games. Molly is an excellent host.

The space was clutter free, intentionally designed, and very clean. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, baking pans, etc. to fit our needs, a cute coffee bar, and plenty of counter space. The bedrooms were set at one side of the home, which allowed for those who wanted to go to bed early while others stayed up to visit. We found a noise machine to be helpful with our little one going down earlier than the rest of the family. Thanks for a beautiful and thoughtful space to stay!"

Comfy bed and quiet, beautiful surroundings. There is a heater that will go off briefly at night, so ear plugs may be useful during the winter. I would stay again!"

The place was clean and spacious and the small kitchenette was well stocked and perfect for 2 nights. Diane was very friendly and responsive. And there’s a fabulous donut place nearby too. Make sure you check it out! Thanks for sharing your place, Diane."

The hosts are very friendly and responsive to questions. It is ideal for a couple; a third person can stay on an airbed they have. There is not an actual kitchen, but it has a microwave, coffee pot, toaster, and small fridge. Not really set up for lots of meal prep, but we were able to toast bagels, reheat food, etc. Being right next to the college makes it so easy for us to stay there, and I'm sure we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Our hosts were incredibly thoughtful and welcoming. Very kind and genuine people. We felt especially safe here, and the location is quite charming and quiet, but with easy access into town if you need to pick anything up or grab food. Check-in was easy and communication timely and helpful. The space was much larger than we had anticipated and very comfortable and ""homey."" The accommodations were comfortable, and our hosts were even extra thoughtful by turning a lamp on in the space for us before we came home in the evening after it was dark.
Bonus perk: My hair was softer after washing it in the shower there than it has been in years with our over-treated, extra-hard water back at home. I didn't even know my hair was capable of being that soft and shiny. It was a nice vacation for my hair as well as the rest me."

Diane reached out ahead of our arrival to make sure we knew how to get there, where we could park and how to get inside. Upon our arrival, Diane greeted us to ensure everything was to our liking, ask us if we wanted wood for the outside fire pit and if there was anything she could do to make our stay more comfortable. She even left some snacks for us and cool water from their well. After that she disappeared, giving us our privacy. The place is more spacious than it looks in the pictures and it is SUPER clean! The bed is comfortable, the water pressure in the shower is strong, and the inside and outside are charming. I HIGHLY recommend staying at the Country Garden Retreat!"

Stayed a few nights","We spent a weekend at Diane's place while visiting our daughter who attends Corban. It was a perfect location for that purpose, right by the campus. We have stayed at various hotels in Salem, and this was so much more convenient and comfortable. The rooms were clean and quiet; the view out the windows onto a garden and wooded area, with a bit of a view of the valley, was beautiful and peaceful. The hosts were very kind and welcoming, and we enjoyed chatting with them, but they also left us alone. There were many hospitable touches such as little muffins, yogurt and juice in the fridge, paper cups by the sink, coffee and cereal available, and a water dispenser that Diane kept filled for us. The kitchenette area consists of a small fridge, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, and a few supplies. There is no kitchen sink or counters, nor freezer to speak of (although I've no doubt Diane would have put something in her freezer for us if we'd asked --- she was very accommodating). An extra table somewhere to provide more ""counter"" space would be helpful. But in general, if you are planning on eating in, keep it simple, with items that don't require a lot of prep or freezer space, and you’ll do great. All in all, a very nice stay and we will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This is an absolute gem in the AirBnB world. Guests have the whole bottom floor of the house - a HUGE living area, large bedroom and large bathroom (shower, not tub). Everything is very clean and feels well cared for. As the description indicates, there is no real 'kitchen' - in particular, no sink, and you do not do dishes in the bathroom sink (the house is on septic). BUT, Diane does provide a way to have the basic dishes (glasses, plates, bowls, silverware) washed upstairs. So heating things in the microwave, or having other foods that don't require a full-on kitchen are fine. In addition to the incredible comfort, cleanliness and spaciousness of this lodging, the outdoor space is amazing - you have your own patio, with seating and fire pit, and a truly gorgeous view - a hilly oak tree savannah landscape. It's quiet, peaceful and beautiful. It's about a 10-15 minute drive to 'downtown' Salem, but there are lots of restaurants, shops etc, even closer. We had a great stay at Diane's (and Tom's), and would definitely stay again."

Diane was very welcoming but not in the least intrusive. I wasn't expecting to find a gem like this at such a low cost, but am very happy I found Diane's wonderful place.

I cut my finger with glasses accidently, Diane and Tom help me to clean the mess and patch my finger for me. couldn't ask for better host!! stay with them, you won't regret it !"

Stayed a few nights",Diane went above and beyond with making us feel comfortable and welcomed. There was a little mini kitchen area with cereal coffee and a fridge with snacks and milk and some drinks. We had more space than i expected and lots of privacy. Tom and Diane even helped us set up the firepit outside so we could make smores. Highly recommend staying here.

We were exhausted and Diane made it super easy for us to get in. We arrived pretty late and were able to self check-in and settle in for the night. Diane also had a mini continental breakfast set up for us, which was such a nice touch since we were getting back on the road for another long drive the next morning! The location is great not to far from Portland if you want to head to the outlets or downtown. The space itself was huge and nice, and we slept soundly. Would definitely stay here again if were travelling through Oregon!"

Stayed a few nights","Tom and Diane were both wonderful!
The house is conveniently located close to the city, but the tranquility and peacefulness is countryside living at its best. There is also a nice view of some city lights in the evening and if the weathers just right a beautiful sunset too!
Their home was the perfect retreat and respite I needed while spending time with my father during his recovery at Salem hospital.
Tom sent me some supportive text messages to help keep my spirits up, and Diane kept the little refrigerator well stocked and I was able to enjoy a little breakfast each morning. I really did feel spoiled and didn’t even have to do the dishes!
I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Tom also gave me a departing gift of some rhubarb from his garden.
Thank you both for everything!
