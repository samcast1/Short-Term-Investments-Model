Stayed a few nights","We rented the apartment for the weekend. Our son & his family came to participate in the Greater Goldsboro Road Run. They arrived to a perfect retreat in which to rest up before and relax after the run. They enjoyed lunch and dinner in nearby restaurants, walked and shopped in the bustling downtown, and my son was able to show off his hometown. Recently retired from the Air Force, Chip has spent the past 22 years seeing the world, but his twins haven’t seen much of his hometown. What a great reintroduction to Goldsboro.
Thank you, Erin for being a friendly and responsive host. We are excited to know that we have a great option for them on their next visit."

Even though the second bedroom isn’t fully closed off, it feels separate from the rest of the place. Check out the pizza place downstairs and the “Ice Storm” for the lemonade! Will definitely"

We loved being where the action is, nice restaurants, shops, coffee shop, super friendly people. Monica and Tyler ( the plumber) helped me download key code, awesome). NO.NOISE from the restaurant below, ever so often a “wind up” car screaming past, it was a fun stay! Suggestion: 1 more non to hang bath towel and mirror over desk ( so when hubby occupies bathroom too long I can paint my face. Loved having Keuric coffee pods❗️❤️💃🕺"

We truly enjoyed people watching out the windows- it was Prom Weekend. Also, Lane Tree GC has a full spread and popular Sunday buffet with relaxing vistas (definitely good food) as we met over 8 sheriff and police officers while dining there over past 3 days!!"

Stayed a few nights","So glad we found this gem - for anyone traveling to Goldsboro for baseball, this is closer to the C35 venue and nicer than any hotel! Cute shopping and eating area (about 6 blocks, give or take) that had lots of options for hungry teens and some good beverages and shopping for the parents. Apartment was clean and airy and even with the restaurant downstairs it was quiet for sleeping. If we return to Goldsboro in the future this would absolutely be a place I'd return to. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights",We loved our time here. It’s right on the cute main downtown street easily walkable to all downtown Goldsboro has to offer Parking was always available on the street or in the public lot behind the building. For those with mobility issues this may not be a great place to stay. There is a very long flight of stairs to get to the second floor and no elevator. Also if ur sensitive to noise and like to go to bed early this may not be the right place for u. U r right above La Brisas restaurant. They r open till 10pm on weekends. The place was as described and the host was super responsive when we were having issues working the shower faucet. U need to pull the handle out to get full water pressure. Once we figured that out the shower was AMAZING. Bathroom floors r HEATED. Was super nice touch to feel the warm tiles when u got up in the AM. There is a Keurig with coffee pods in the kitchen. Would be tight for 4 people in my opinion. Perfect size for 2. We’d def stay again.

Very luxurious bed too! I was there over the weekend so the restaurant downstairs was noisy until about 10 pm but you could barely hear it in the bedroom with closed door. Lots of great shops and food in easy walking distance. I would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was absolutely fantastic! The location, the loft itself, all amazing! Jeremiah was super responsive and so helpful. He would reply within minutes to every question I had. Including prior to booking— I wanted to see how far the loft was from the wedding I was attending and he replied right away and told me! The loft is located right above the cutest little area. Restaurants, shopping & amazing coffee shops are all walking distance. The loft had everything you needed, it was spacious and cozy at the same time! If I ever have to travel back to this area, I will definitely stay at this loft! Also, the Cave & the Gypsy Bean Coffee was sooo good!"

The units were very comfortable, and close to restaurants in a nice area. Each unit had 3 large rooms, new modern appliances, 2 TVs, internet, and excellent security.
I appreciate the hospitality that I was shown, and recommend this location to visitors to the area."

Stayed with kids",We had a great stay in Goldsboro. We came down for the annual pickle festival (about a 20 minute drive from the lofts) and wanted to stay somewhere within walking distance of restaurants and shopping. Parking was free but we had an issue finding a spot close to the lofts so that was frustrating with carrying our luggage. We checked in Friday evening and it was very busy at that time. The loft is exactly as shown in the pictures and the heated floor in the bathroom was a very nice touch. The hosts were great to communicate with and answered all of my questions promptly.

Stayed a few nights","When I initially arrived at the property, it wasn't clean, and I couldn't spend the night. I messaged the host and AirBnB support upon check-in (2am), and it was all uphill from there. My host was simply amazing. Not only did he respond first thing in the morning, but he also contacted the cleaning company directly to address my concerns. He and his wife went above and beyond to rectify the situation and personally cleaned the loft. I CANNOT say enough about how genuine and caring he was. From the moment we spoke to the minute I checked out, he ensured I was taken care of. Jeremiah is truly a gem and is well deserving of his Super Host title. If you are in the Goldsboro/Cary/Kinston/LaGrange areas and are looking for a place to stay RUN to Jeremiah's loft. You will not be disappointed. This is now my to go spot when I visit family from out of state."

If this is your first time in Goldsboro, as it was ours, you’ll love the fact that many great restaurants and shops are very accessible from this place. The downtown location was perfect, as we were able to walk to everything, right out the front door. Overall, I highly recommend this place!

The bed and sofa bed were very comfortable, and we had no trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi or plugging our fire stick in for tv options. It was very clean and the sheets and blankets were so soft and cozy!! My son appreciated the black out shades in the living room, definitely a nice touch, and then during the day, you get plenty of natural light through the wall of windows. Jeremiah was easy to reach with questions, and lovely to talk to. This apartment is beautiful, totally redone to be both tasteful and inviting, and it truly is right downtown, not to mention that the downtown is adorable, with friendly merchants and people to boot. Heated tile floors and endless hot water in an airbnb?? Dreams do come true. I was able to find close parking on the street every day, and the bistro downstairs (Brisas) is outstanding- we actually went there twice we loved it so much. Thanks Jeremiah for a having us, we hope to visit again!"

Stayed with kids","Chelsea was an incredible host! Very responsive, clear communication, friendly, and flexible. The house is thoughtfully stocked with all the essentials and was thoughtfully prepared specifically for us. Prior to check in, Chelsea asked about what sleeping arrangements would be best for us and set up additional beds and a crib to accommodate us better. She also was flexible with our requests.
The house itself is beautiful! It’s a very old house, but it has been beautifully maintained. Everything is tastefully updated to retain its 100 year old charm. Beds were comfortable with a variety of pillows so everyone could sleep comfortably. Oftentimes Airbnb’s are stocked with cheap basic household items, but this house is stocked with quality furniture, appliances, kitchenware, etc., and it’s also stocked with lots of everything.
Despite being an old house, there’s no draftiness, and the AC kept the house very comfortable the entire time, even when we were in and out of the house."

Group trip","This is a top-notch Airbnb for a large group, especially for a family. We had family in town for a wedding and this was perfect to gather and enjoy a special time with each other. Chelsea made this part of the weekend stress-free.
From a family member: This home is a sweet gem in a tiny town! Chelsea was an extraordinary host, going above and beyond across the board!
We felt welcomed from the moment we stepped in the door. She left a personal note and special touches such as the treats on the towels. With college and school-age kids, the house is fully loaded with indoor/outdoor games, books, TVs. To have King beds in all bedrooms is an unusual find, they were firm but slept very well. This kitchen is AWESOME, incredibly stocked. Perfect dining table! To hear history of the house and ownership was a bonus. They have done an incredible renovation in a short time. We have stayed in Airbnbs in US and Europe and this is one of the best we've stayed in! Thanks for sharing your cozy home!"

Group trip",The potential for an awesome experience fails because the property is drastically not maintained and or needs repairs outside and inside. Folding doors in the Study off track and difficult to use. Paint pealing throughout the property. Bedroom sinks are not draining properly and or there’s no water from the faucet. Bathroom toilet upstairs water bowl needs repair. Fireplace doesn’t work. TV in kitchen doesn’t work. Lack of news channels such as MSNBC or CNBC or I couldn’t find them. This is grossly unfair to the customer and surprisingly or perhaps not important enough to complain about.

Stayed with kids",I’ve stayed at several places and I have never had the level of attention to detail that this host had. The amenities she thought of and provided made it amazing. I usually try to remember to pack all my needs but always forget something. Ms. Chelsea had everything I could need or want plus some. The house is an older home but was tastefully decorated and did not hinder any of the charm associated with the home. I had a great stay. Ms. Chelsea should be commended for her attention to detail and her availability and responsiveness to messages was also greatly appreciated.

The kitchen had everything one could ever need to cook. There were games and activities to play. There was even a crib and high chair - we were traveling with 2 babies. Chelsea even bought a pack and play for my infant to sleep in! The master has plenty of space and we had a great time! I would absolutely stay here again!"

Group trip","I booked Chelsea’s at the request of my Mom as I am also a host and she was unfamiliar with the airbnb platform. Mom came across Chelsea’s property in Goldsboro while looking for a place to house the family for my Aunt’s funeral. From the minute you walk in the door you can feel the love that has gone into this home. To start.. it’s beautiful. And probably one of the largest most tasteful homes in town. Very comfortable with nice touches everywhere. (Loved the little chocolates in the restrooms), the beds were AWESOME and it’s situated right by the downtown area which has a farmers market, shops and restaurants. The highlight of the stay had to be the host Chelsea. She was great with my stressed mom and the circumstances around the visit. My family sends their thanks for the fantastic stay and the 5 ⭐️hospitality we received. I highly HIGHLY recommend a stay at Chelsea’s beautiful property."

The next time I come back home to North Carolina I hope that this place is available for rent I’d definitely come back and stay again.
Once Again Thanks for your great hospitality Steve and Hannah. 🤩😎"

Full bath with a fully stocked bathroom (aside from soap and shampoo...I always bring my own anyway). Queen bed that was comfortable (although slightly too firm for my liking). Garage did not have direct indoor access to the suite, but given that most places don't have a garage at all, that was an insignificant detail in my book. Hosts were very responsive, accommodating and had no issue with my moving reservation (shifted by 1-day) or late check-in. Great stay that was well worth the price, highly recommended!"

Although it's not their fault, I wish there had been sidewalks in the neighborhood, because shopping and restaurant were two blocks away. Found a great little diner (Kathy's Kitchen) that served a GREAT breakfast. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for a great stay!"

Home features a living room, formal dining room, den, eat in kitchen, two car garage, 4 bedrooms and 2 baths. There were plenty of kitchen items, although we didn’t use any. A couple of things I wish were changed. I wish the bathrooms were updated, shirt blue toilets, and the pillows were better, these pillows were flat. The bathroom sinks had rust in them and the hall bath had some mold on the caulking. The entryway into the house floor feels soft, but I do weight over 300 pounds. We felt safe the entire stay. I still feel this home is great."

Group trip","One of the best AirBnb homes we’ve ever been using. I didn’t micro critique the bedroom furniture, but a dresser for clothes ie : underwear socks etc would have been nice, especially if the stay is more than a couple days. Possibly an end table per bed. Master bedroom had an end table on each side of the bed. But we’re used to typical travel accommodation conditions. Would have been nice to have received a refund for letting you know ahead of time that we would be leaving a day early, as was done for us when we stayed in Kinston in December 2021. We actually finished our project in Kinston 3 days earlier than expected. Fully refunded for those days. I mentioned that possibility when setting up this reservation weeks ago."

She charged me extra because my 5 year old daughter ended up coming with me. Beds was comfortable but the house smell bothered us all a lot. The floors as you first walk in felt like they was going to fall in. Over all i eould rate it a 3. I just felt very nervous to stay there from all the rules she had.

Stayed a few nights","Communication with Linda was good. The home is vintage throwback which was fine.
However, while the house was free of dust/dirt, there was an overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke and cigarette butts on the patio and scattered throughout the yard. My husband and daughter both have asthma and had asthma attacks due to this. When going into the garage to place trash in bin (the bin was outside, not in garage as stated in checkout instructions) my husband required an inhaler due to the horribly strong smell of cigarette smoke in the garage.
The cleaning team should have addressed this before our arrival. Thank goodness we spent very little time at the property…otherwise we would have left and gotten a smoke free room at a hotel."

While comfortable enough overall, as one of the highlights were very comfortable beds, it was not very clean. If you are sensitive to smells you probably won't want to stay here- the sheets had a strong laundered smell, and you could sometimes smell that pets lived in the home. I would not want to stay here again. I can deal with an old home, but not a dirty one."

The location was ideal, close to restaurants, and downtown and a very short drive to the AFB. The loft was exactly as described and more than we could have hoped for. If you have any reason to visit Goldsboro and you need a place to stay DO NOT hesitate. This IS the place. The loft is above a lawyer's office with access from the back of the building. Once inside you climb app 17 stairs to enter a private door into the loft. The pictures do not do it justice. It was impeccably decorated yet cozy and inviting. Nina was very quick to respond whenever I had a question.
We had an absolutely wonderful weekend. Thank you, Nina and the Loft!!!

Was the best thing that could have happened to us. Came across the Barrister’s Loft. The place was incredible!!! It was immaculate and the decor and furnishings were awesome. The legal theme running throughout the loft was a nice perk to a fellow attorney. And the customer service from the hosts was beyond belief. Not only were they helpful and responsive, but they went above and beyond with things provided in the loft like little chocolates, candles and custom-made soaps all the way to offering to order us groceries so they were there when we arrived. We truly appreciated the time and effort they put into renting the Loft. Look forward to coming back and staying there next fall!"

Perfect for two couples who want to get away together or even two friends who want to hang out but also have their own space. Perfect for making a dinner or breakfast. I had my one year old with me (who is learning to walk) and (I had to relocate some decor to a safe place so it wouldn’t get destroyed) but well worth it because she had so much room to walk and crawl all over and I was able to sit in one spot and see her the whole time.

It was a super relaxing stay and the bed was very comfy. Although we didn’t have any guests staying with us, the way the loft is set up would allow for adequate space since there is a front bedroom and back bedroom so all guests would have some space from each other which is great when traveling with drowned so you don’t feel right on top of each other. Everything felt newly renovated and was done thoughtfully and tastefully. I definitely recommend staying here! Thanks again, Nina & Rachel!"

There are lots of stairs to climb to get to the apartment. There is a pub below the apartment which played loud music on Sat & Sun; Mon was less loud. There is an outdoor court for the brewery that people hung out until closing. I wore earplugs and it helped. If you are young at heart and don’t mind hearing music/people enjoying a fun evening this is a perfect place to stay.

Got to hang together as a family and have our space. It had everything we needed, it was private, and had an amazing backyard for our dog. It has a great patio and fire pit, we just didn’t have enough time. We’d definitely stay at Pedro’s again. It’s so close to everything in Goldsboro/ the base, restaurants in the area, etc. thank you Pedro, we hope to come back again and stay at your place. Beats a hotel any day!"

This was our first time using an Airbnb. Our family was able to spend time together, make memories and feeling like we were at home. We enjoyed our time in this beautiful home. We will be using this location on our next trip to NC. Thank you, Pedro and Juan, for taking great care of us."

The inside of the house is spacious with plenty of room for a group including plenty of seating in living and dining rooms. The kitchen had all you needed, there were games to play, big TV and great patio seating outside. I especially loved watching the local Air Force jets practice. The bedrooms were comfy and I’ll shout out the master bathroom shower - AMAZING! Great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The entire place was super clean and comfortable and i wouldn’t hesitate to come again. 5 min from Cliffs of the Neuse State Park, plenty of restaurants nearby, breweries, css Neuse only 20 min and so much more."

Stayed a few nights","Robin's place was a perfect home away from home while visiting Goldboro! Her home served as a home base while visiting my mother for her birthday weekend. Mom has mobility issues, and having one walk-in shower was a bonus!
The home is beautifully decorated and well-appointed, with everything you need for a stay. The bedrooms were good size, the beds were comfortable, and the linens were nice. Robin's attention to detail with interior decorating and personal touches personalized the welcome experience and enhanced the tranquillity and sense that this is a home, not just a house.
I visited during an unseasonably cold weekend, but the home was warm and cozy. There is a large fenced backyard and deck with plenty of chairs. Robin's place is in a quiet residential area but close to a small shopping area with a grocery store and some restaurants, including traditional barbeque, Chinese, and fantastic Thai food nearby. I will visit again in the future!"

Stayed with a pet",The home is very comfortable and lovely. Nice big back yard if you bring your animals. There is an airforce base near by so if you are an aviation fan you get to see the jet planes on the deck at times. Robin is a gracious and accommodating host that cares about your stay.

Stayed a few nights","When I look at reviews, I appreciate when guests give details, not just ratings. Here's mine:
-top notch cleanliness (seriously, some highly rated hotels don't even compare)
-bright, welcoming rooms (from decor & natural light)
-comfy temperature & smelled lovely (nothing worse than walking into a stale smelling, warm room)
-an abundance of soft, fluffy, & sizeable towels/washcloths (i hate reaching for a scratchy, thin towel that doesn't cover much)
-the complimentary ""personal care mini bar"" in the bathroom was a nice touch
-coffee, sugar, and creamer supplied
-we didn't use anything in the kitchen other than coffee stuff, but it was well stocked with seasonings, utensils, cups, and other basic items
-comfy beds, pillows, & blankets
-quiet location (there were your typical night time cruisers with poor music taste, but it wasn't an nuisance)
Overall, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely book here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Thank you so much… your place is absolutely beautiful. Location was the perfect! I wish we had more time to check out the area. It was absolutely adorable so many shops, so many restaurants, nice bars, local business owners, and things like that. It was the perfect place to be situated in. You really didn’t have to go far for anything. Everything was so modern. It was refreshing that I could lay in the bed and comfortably sleep, It felt so clean and like home. Thank you for the vanity area to do the make up in the bedroom that was perfect. If I had to give it any critique, it would be I would’ve loved to seen a standup mirror just retire as women we got to make sure we look good from head to toe.. LOL BUT TO BE SERIOUS IF WE EVER CAME BACK OUT TO THIS PART OF TOWN, WE WOULD DEFINITELY TRY TO RESERVE THIS BEAUTIFUL AIRBNB AGAIN. ALSO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FLEXIBILITY."

Stayed a few nights",This was a nice stay for my first ever airbnb. Communication was wonderful and very responsive when needed. The loft is very nice. I'm not sure I would stay with 4 adults though. It's very good for a couple. It was a lot smaller then I thought based on the photos.. It would work fine for 4 adults I just hope you are all close. I think the only negative thing I really have to say which is more user error is I did not like using the app to check In. I was left standing outside for 5-10 minutes trying to get the app to work and connect and just asked for a passcode instead.. which I might have already been given it and I missed it which is my fault.. The passcode is VERY nice to have even if you have no issue with the app. I do wish there was a full length mirror either in the bathroom behind the door or in the hallway before you leave. I will most likely never stay in NC again but if I did I would stay here again. :)

Fantastic Latin restaurant on first floor makes you feel like you are in south beach instead of North Carolina. We felt very safe. Amenities were top notch! The heated floor in the bathroom spoiled me to the point that our home bathroom floors are depressing. Your feet deserve these heated floors! Jeremiah was a great host. He was very responsive and very understanding.
Don’t second guess yourself. Book this AirBnB! You will not find a better place to stay in the area. You won’t be disappointed until you have to check out."

Great shower and bathroom. Close to the downtown shops and restaurants. Locals are super friendly. The Latin restaurant downstairs can make a little noise with live music on Fri and Sat nights, but it's muffled. Bring a white noise maker and you should be okay if you need to hit the sack before midnight."

Stayed a few nights","The Loft is beautiful, comfortable, and spacious. The blue cabinets, gold fixtures and furniture are all quality. I fell in love with the heated floor in the bathroom and the shower has amazing water temperature and pressure. The kitchen has a refrigerator/freezer with more than enough space if you grocery shop while you travel which I do as well as large spacious cabinets. All the essentials are provided if you want to cook as well as cleaning supplies. The washer and dryer are fast, efficient and convenient. There is ample space to store luggage in the closets. Even though I travel with my Firestick, it was a nice touch to have Roku tv’s in the bedroom and living room. In addition to the comforts in the loft, there are plenty of places to eat within seconds to a few minutes walk. (Latin Fusion downstairs, Asian Fusion, pizza, and Thai food across the street and Mexican and Irish food one street away.) There is plenty of parking in the area, so if that has been an issue with other locations, you can put your mind at ease here. Yes, there is an actual residence, so you can expect to hear families, but it wasn’t anything I couldn’t tune out or drown out with tv. The restaurant downstairs also has live music some nights, but it isn’t very late and I really enjoyed the music floating up."

Stayed a few nights","Can’t say enough great things about this place! I honestly was very surprised that a beautiful place like this existed in Goldsboro. Good location right in the middle of downtown area. Centrally located. The building has been renovated to absolute perfection. It is incredibly beautiful and an awesome place to stay. The exposed original brick, the gorgeous kitchen and the heated bathroom floor were some of my favorite touches. Overall just a very updated, stylish, cozy place. Would definitely recommend and will be staying here during all of my future trips to Goldsboro!
Only downside... the bedroom gets EXTREMELY hot, even with AC and overhead fan on. The kind of heat that will wake you up out of your sleep. Not sure if it has something to do with the unit above or the heated bathroom floor (which shares a wall with the bedroom.) I had to sleep in the living room because of this but didn’t mind it since there is a pull out couch."

Close to many nice restaurants, shops, and ice cream parlors. Private off road parking in back of building. With the Christmas decorations currently set up downtown it is absolutely beautiful and a nice place to take a walk with your loved ones. We look forward to staying again one day if possible.

The only thing that we did not like was no ice maker in the refrigerator which is no big deal, we are just used to that from the other places we have stayed. I would definitely like to stay here when I visit again. Thank you Erin"

Stayed with kids","We had a one-night stop at Erin’s place on our way to the beach. We could tell Erin makes a big effort to keep her place clean and sanitized which we appreciate as we are travelling with an immunocompromised child. She has also made an effort when it comes to the decor and safety. There is an alarm which is very straightforward to use. Erin also provided water and some snacks which came in handy after a long drive. All in all, this was a good place for a one-night stop. One thing came up which is easy to address and which will definitely take her guests’ experience to the next level. Although the kitchen has everything you need to make yourself at home, the can opener was rusty so we had to change our dinner plans at the last minute. The paper towel holder and the rings on the shower curtain were also rusty. I know this happens often in the south because of t humidity, but addressing these little issues would make the whole space even better. I still recommend this place to other travellers and hope Erin continues to be a successful Airbnb host."

Pros:
-Location was convenient to everything we wanted to do in Goldsboro.
-Excellent price! We got a lot of bang for our buck.
-Lots of space, bedrooms were a great size.
-The house has a security system which made us feel great!
Cons:
-The house is on a main road and traffic was a bit noisy at times.
-The floors in the house are pretty uneven, our 20 month old had some trouble walking around.
-There were no mirrors above the sinks in either bathroom. As someone who does a lot with their hair and makeup each day, it was inconvenient.
Overall we had a good experience. The house was clean and Erin was a good communicator. Check in and out was super easy."

Upon checking the crime map at my arrival, I was extremely alarmed to see there was 4 sex offenders within 400 meters and a robbery on the block the week prior. I had my three young daughter with me and did not feel safe. Airbnb does not have a policy against advertising to families in crime ridden neighborhoods, so do your due diligence, check the Goldsboro crime map, and make sure you're comfortable at what you see prior to booking."

Erin really provides everything you’ll need except food. Lol I’m not sure if she’s a religious woman but it’s a sweet calming spirit over the home as if someone has been praying in there! WHEW 😮‍💨 I’m not staying anywhere else when I come home to Goldsboro. HIGHLY RECOMMEND‼️
