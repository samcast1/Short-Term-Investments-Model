Stayed about a week","The Mesa House is gorgeously arranged, clean in every corner, with modern interior design that also feels homely. Also, the entire house smells great! My family and I enjoyed our stay, there’s plenty to explore in Jefferson City (check out the local coffee shops, Yanis Coffee Zone in particular). Tara was extremely responsive to our needs during our stay, stepping in to help us with a small issue despite it being a holiday. We felt at home, which was greatly appreciated. The neighborhood is quiet, no noise, no drama, no frills. Perfectly residential while still being close to the attractions of Jefferson City. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed to make home cooked meals. Overall, it was everything we were hoping for. Great spot!"

While our weather wasn’t the greatest, we were still able to enjoy ourselves playing bags and such under the house and still have great views of the river. Beds were very comfortable and so was the living room furniture - great for lounging with a good book. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Spotless! Location was peaceful and seemed safe. Host was responsive. We enjoyed the spacious deck overlooking the river, and when the wind was too high, the indoor seating was comfortable. There were plenty of windows and natural light. The kitchen had ample space and was reasonably well stocked for an Airbnb. The beds were comfortable and I appreciated the open shelving and multiple wall hooks. The hot water pressure was good. We had looked forward to kayaking, but the currents were way too fast, and then the water level dropped significantly, so if kayaking is your thing, have an alternate plan. Rock Bridge Memorial Park was only a 35-40 minute drive and had a good variety of hikes. We also enjoyed watching and listening to the trains pass by. If noise disturbs you, pack earplugs. Overall, very pleasant stay."

Stayed a few nights",We loved our stay !! The kitchen was well stocked with coffee and creamers. Beautiful scenery. Comfortable beds. We enjoyed the deck. Having morning coffee while watching the Osage river is an awesome experience. We fished from the dock and got a few bites. We would love to return during the summer. The state capital and former Missouri State Penn are 15-20 minutes away and very fun to visit for history buffs. We highly recommend Audrey’s Osage river getaway.

The home had everything we could possibly need and more! We have stayed in our share of Airbnb's and this home was more equipped than any other rental we've stayed at - kitchen had everything, bathroom had everything, toys for kids, kayaks outside ready to go with lifejackets.... You name it- they had it! The area is peaceful and the neighbors are kind. We'd recommend this place to anyone & everyone looking for a nice, relaxing vacation."

Stayed a few nights","Was definitely an amazing experience, there was stuff for everybody to do games and books, corn hole game, kayaks, which we spent hours and hours on them, caught lots of fish. Did a bunch of swimming The water was perfect for that! Nice big sitting area with windows all around to see the river, every corner was extremely clean, also had a nice big deck right off the kitchen, where we ate all of our meals! It was definitely something I needed, was a great stress reliever, especially going out early in the mornings, and listening to all the wildlife and birds, waking up, and especially the trains going across the bridge, and the train whistles, echoing through the hills, not too close to be noisy and not too far away were you could hardly hear them just perfect! We all went as a family. nine of us slept in there, the boys just threw camping cots on the floor in the front room was plenty of room for that! Will we go back again? Absolutely! Just looking for another break in my schedule. ;)"

Stayed with kids","We come to Jefferson city quite often to visit family for holidays, birthdays, etc. We've stayed in numerous places in town and this is our new favorite. Host provides a plethora of everyday things a family would need. All types of seasonings, foil and plastic wrap, extra batteries, crayons and coloring books for kids, etc etc etc. Host was extremely responsive and kind. They let us check out a bit late so we could go to Easter lunch after church with our family and it was greatly appreciated.
The decor here is on point. It feels very cozy and fun. Decorated better than our own house 😩 lol. We will always seek to stay here from now on when we come to town."

The home was super clean and stocked with everything you could ever need and LABELED!! You never wondered where anything was due to the cute labels in the kitchen and throughout the home.
Did I mention the extremely comfy beds? I about messaged Heather asking where she got her linens from! So comfortable and warm!!
The home is also filled with little touches of Jefferson City’s history even down to the carpets! I’ll let you see for yourself ☺️
When back in town, we will definitely check to see if Heather’s cottage is available again!"

The beds and linens were very comfortable and there were tons of little extras throughout the house that really made it feel like home. We all enjoyed the little room off the kitchen to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea. If we ever have the need to stay if Jeff City again we would definitely book here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I don’t usually write lengthy reviews…but this one is long. To say that this AirBnB was one of the best experiences we have had is an understatement. Heathers house was adorable throughout. You would notice cute little touches throughout, which makes it feel like your home while you are there. The couches in the living room were comfortable, and there’s plenty of comfy blankets and pillows for vegging out. The kitchen has everything you need, easily located in the various cabinets. The washer and dryer came in super handy. But, the best thing? Little things like mints, wash clothes for makeup removal, a checker board end table, laundry detergent, fancy hand soaps 😊….choose this place….you won’t regret it."

The hosts provide so much value for an Airbnb. They do a great job of cleaning and communicating.

Stayed about a week","We booked this location to be close to relatives as we had a family death. We stayed in this home for a week. It was by far the best! Cold water bottles in frig when we arrived. The home has new top load washer and dryer in basement. There were laundry pods, dryer sheets provided. They have details throughout the home and instructions for everything you need to use or borrow. The cabinets are labeled in the kitchen so you don’t have to keep searching. Baking and cooking supplies are all here. They have sugar, flour, oil, pan spray, quite an assortment of spices especially for grilling. Plenty of dishwasher pods and soap. Bath and Bodyworks kitchen soap and hand-soaps. Kitchen cleaners and dishtowels/dish scrubbers. Coffee bar with coffee pods and sugars. Plus handy instructions on how to use the coffee maker. Ziplocks, foil, wraps available for use. Trash bags and info regarding recycle and trash day. The photos are exactly what you get. The upstairs bedrooms have comfortable king beds. Clean bedding. A/C units in windows upstairs have remote control. Ironing board and new iron. Quiet neighborhood. Parking info as driveway is shared. The shower/tub is upstairs. Dove bodysoap and members mark shampoo available. Laundry chute is upstairs. Wifi and tv’s worked great. We made several meals during stay and everything worked great. Make your own ice as frig didn’t have ice maker. I brought my own tea pitcher. There are measuring cups and measuring spoons. Backyard had bunnies most evenings. I would recommend this location to anyone. The couch has foldout bed and bedding was easily located. Pack n play was in upstairs closet if needed. Table is tall top but there is small kiddie table and some kid activities.
Not alot of privacy in backyard or deck as its open to all neighbors in this neighborhood. We are used to privacy fences but it wasn’t an issue just different for us. The street is not a thru street so traffic was limited. Full set of plates, bowls, silverware, knives and everything need for grilling except the food.
Love this place❤️❤️❤️"

The loft was beautifully decorated, offering both high end appliances and welcoming touches like Christmas decorations, fluffy bath towels and high quality mattresses throughout.
The central location cannot be beat. From High Street Coffee to Southbank Boutique, make sure to leave time to explore the beauty of High Street.
Mary went out of her way to accommodate our infant, providing toys for all ages and even a high chair and pack and play, which was so thoughtful and helpful.
One thing to be mindful of:
BEDROOMS: The third bedroom is a converted entryway off of the kitchen, with bunk beds and French glass doors. Recommend this room for kids, early risers, athletes and those possessing very minimal luggage.
Any family visiting Jeff City would have a blast in this loft, and great hosting space and kitchen too! Mary’s reccs and availability for questions made this stay extra special, and would recommend to anyone."

We did find this house to be a little loud during sleeping hours. If you are a light sleeper take that into account- emergency vehicle sirens driving by and diesel trucks unloading at prairie farms.

Stayed a few nights","Kim's place is the perfect 3 Bedroom if you want to stay near the heart of JC. Also the location lends to it being private which I liked. The house itself was really clean and well maintained. My only complaint is that it has a smell that I guess lends to the house being 100 years old. That is my only complaint. Other then that the Bedrooms were large and very nice and clean and everything there was kept up and done really well. I would definitely stay at this BnB again in the future if Kim will let me lol

The bathroom and kitchen were also spotless, and the convenience of a washer, dryer, and a relaxing backroom added to the appeal, all exactly as Kim had described. Situated ideally in the heart of Jefferson City, it was conveniently near the stunning Missouri State Capitol building. Major retail destinations such as Walmart, Target, Sam's Club, and Kohl's were just a stone's throw away, along with an array of dining options. This charming abode truly won us over."

Imagine a fairy godparent with an extra dash of cool dedicated ti ensuring you have the very best time. The house manual? It's more of a treasure map leading to pleasure. Pay attention to the tiny details sprinkled throughout—it's like the host is playfully challenging you, sparking eye rolls and delighted chuckles, especially when you realize you've been outsmarted without them even being there. It’s tough to spill all the thoughtful touches aimed at ensuring your safety, outstanding service, and a good laugh without ruining the surprise. Just go for it; it’s every bit as enchanting as promised. You’ll be daydreaming about your next visit before those red velvet curtains close."

Stayed one night","The host was amazing! The dungeon was immaculate; very clean and in like-new condition. First class furnishings, and they spared no expense!
As far as equipment, you will likely want to bring your own toys from home. Aside from a set of cuffs and a few percussive toys, there isn’t much beyond the furniture, so you’re on your own there. However, given the intimate nature of the space, we preferred our own.
As you can see from the photos, the bed upstairs was a little tricky getting in/out of, but otherwise was clean and comfortable. The mattress was a medium-firm gel foam, I believe.
The bathroom was similarly clean and everything was new.
All in all, it was a wonderful experience for me and my wife, and we can’t wait to get back!"

The whole place was much more beautiful than the pictures do justice. There's plenty of cleaning supplies and amenities in the house, everything you could think of. Squeaky clean. The couch was not only gorgeous but comfortable. The host was very accommodating to an early check in and/or late check out with our fluctuating schedule, which made the little over 4 hour drive even more worth it!

The only negative was the neighborhood. The direct neighbors were very nice and were so friendly when we saw them in the morning - but there are some sketchy places surrounding. I wasn’t super nervous, but it’s worth mentioning as it was a bit of a surprise for us. Given that the home itself is top notch, it was just weird. I would 100% recommend this place."

I would only note there is no bathtub if you have littles and there were no doors in the showers. It was a modern look & still were great, just letting families know. We’d definitely have to stay here again when in Jefferson City."

We were a group of six staying for three nights for a wedding nearby (Daisy Farm ~15 minutes away), but with activities as far away as at Lake of the Ozark (~45 minutes). We were able to walk to downtown and the capitol pretty easily. There's also a coffee shop and whiskey bar immediately across the street. So location-wise, this is a great spot.
For the house itself, it was also great. We really enjoyed spending time on the shaded front porch (sad we didn't get a chance to use the pool table). It was clean and exactly as pictured. Bobbie was great and easy to communicate with. I would recommend this house to anyone looking to bunk up in Jeff City!"

The king size bed mattresses were the perfect balance of firm and soft, and the linens made us feel right at home. It was quiet and peaceful each night of our stay.
Bobbie was incredibly prompt in all of our communication, both before and during our stay.

All of the finishes in the airbnb were perfect; stainless steel appliances, the beds were high-end (tempurpedic?), amazing pillows, the host was very communicative. Again, masterclass on an Airbnb.
The key takeaway is that this place is severely undersold and I will be staying here every time I’m back in Jeff City."

I can’t say enough about the location. It’s very close to downtown and the trail systems to the north of the city, and it was also easy to teach groceries and restaurants outside the downtown area. I highly recommend this house."

All details were taken care of, we were away from the craziness of Columbia and it was the perfect place to just hang out and spend time with our son. We would definitely stay here again."

I stay in Airbnb’s because I find they are typically cleaner than a hotel. Jason’s place might be the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed in. This place was spotless. Seriously, there wasn’t a speck of dust anywhere! The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Beds are super comfy. We enjoyed the nice view of the back yard with great outdoor furniture. Check in was easy and communication was friendly and helpful. We were under 10 minutes from downtown which is where we got a great meal and a beautiful view of the State House. If you are in Jefferson City, you must stay at Jason’s."

I failed to see that policy when picking this place and ended up waiting outside of the Airbnb for a bit for the host to send the code.
Aside from this, the space was beautiful, clean and comfortable- highly recommend for families. We only stayed one night and wish we could have stayed longer!"

The hot water is hot, the water pressure is great, the A/C held up to Missouri heat and humidity. Huge tvs, fast wifi, a bathtub for the kids, and a generously sized shower in the second bathroom. Jason was helpful and very responsive to messages. Don’t bother with any other places, just stay here and thank me later."

Both of the two bedrooms and the living room were equipped with large screen televisions. The bed linens and pillows in both were top quality and very comfortable. The large, separate laundry room had plenty of shelving and counter space along with a separate sink and laundry supplies. All of the appliances in the kitchen were new or newer and spotless as well.
All in all great value for the money at a location near to restaurants and attractions in the area. Jason as always was quick to respond to any questions we had and he kept in touch to make sure our stay was trouble free. Basically, I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I'm in town.

We could tell the host really put thought and effort into the decor and items in the home, and a great price for a full house with a kitchen and multiple bedrooms.
The stairway upstairs has one step that is slightly taller step which was a little tricker for my older mother-in-law to get a hang of. It’s worth keeping an eye out for that if you have anyone in your party with a mobility concern. Overall, a great place to stay."

In addition to a large dining room and comfortable living room, laundry, and two outdoor porch sitting areas, there are thoughtful small touches throughout this aesthetically pleasing home from lovely bathroom linens to a step stool in the kitchen to lots of clothes hangers. Although it is quite near an adjacent a three-plex building and although the other unit in the duplex overhead, it is so so quiet. A short walk away from Jefferson City's historic downtown, the quiet and peacefulness extends to the neighborhood with a mixture of homes and offices, Efficient communication from Ryan made us feel welcome."

Such a wonderful alternative to and a million times more comfortable than a hotel. Ryan is very responsive and accommodating. The home is spotless (really spotless!) and extremely comfy. The welcome basket was a delightful surprise and much appreciated after a day of travel. Street parking right in front of the property was always available, but it took a little getting used to because I'm out of practice parallel parking on a hill (and it was a bit more challenging in a rental car). The home is conveniently located near Deborah Cooper Park on Adrian's Island which I found to be a delightful place to walk. I've already booked my return visits for 2024."

The house was immaculate, comfy, and well-decorated and included tons of practical items you would expect to find plus many extras, such as a welcome basket and brochures about surrounding attractions. We walked to the capitol every day, and there were so many things to do on High Street between the capitol building and the bnb. We ate on the strip on two different days, shopped in the shops, played a card game in another venue, and completed a walking tour of downtown Jefferson City using the brochure left for us by the bnb's host. We wouldn't have needed the car the whole time we were there, and we would have had just as much to do. I'm definitely hoping to come back and stay again someday!"

Group trip","Tricia's place was one of the nicest air bnbs we have stayed in. Super clean; nice furniture; comfortable beds; fluffy towels; wonderful showers and kitchen well stocked. Tricia was quick to answer any questions I had prior to check-in. It was between 5-10 minutes to downtown but grocery and fast food closer. We had a group of six that were riding Katy Trail and the hot tub was a great ending to our day. I will say if you plan on using it, turn heat up as soon as you get there so it is warmer by the time you want to get in. The patio by the hot tub was peaceful and private. Beautiful set up. If you are coming from Katy Trail and don't have a shuttle it would be a bit of a ride with some hills and riding in traffic so we were happy we had our own support vehicle to shuttle our bikes. (approx 6.5 miles from trail) Our entire group had nothing but positive things to say about this place. We would definitely stay here again!"

The house sits in a beautiful neighborhood and check in and out was simplistic. There is a hot tub that's enclosed as you walk out of the basement, but we were too busy to enjoy it. Tricia was very informative and responsive from the beginning. We would definitely stay again!"

Check-in and out was super easy, and we didn't need anything while we were there.
Great spot, and will definitely keep this on our list of must-stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Clean and cozy home. Hot tub was pristine and private with nice deck views. We didn’t cook but kitchen was very stocked with amenities. Coffee and creamer being available was a nice bonus. Location is easy to find and home is located in a quiet neighborhood. There was some street noise when sitting outside but otherwise peaceful. Close to restaurants and shopping. Appreciated having a carport for parking and quick access to the inside for loading and unloading. Having shampoo, conditioner and body wash was a nice convenience. Plenty of clean towels for both bathroom and hot tub were readily available for use. Enjoyed having options for tv viewing both upstairs and downstairs and each bedroom."

Stayed a few nights","The inside of the house was cute, clean, and had everything we wanted. Tricia was gracious about our request for an early check in too. Only one thing stood out that was a problem. The hot-tub. The water was murky and based on the recommendation of a hot tub owner, it wasn’t safe to use. This was unfortunate, because that amenity was the one reason we chose this house. I did reach out to the owner about this, but the response wasn’t exactly what I had hoped for. “You should have let me know sooner” and “it was fine the last time I checked” isn’t what I call sympathetic. All and all we still had a nice time, but it could have been better."

Group trip","We were in Jeff to visit relatives for the long weekend. Tricia's place was close and convenient to their home. Tricia's home was lovely and spacious, and with three bedrooms and three baths, there was plenty of room for the five of us to spread out and feel comfortable in the space! I LOVED the decor and it was beyond clean! As a self proclaimed germaphobe, this is always the most important aspect of any stay for my family!!! This is such an upgrade to a boring hotel! I would 100% recommend this Airbnb to anyone and actually already have! Kuddos to Tricia for providing a wonderful experience!!!"

Stayed a few nights",Place was very clean. I did not like the white truck that kept passing and video recording made me feel unsafe or somebody was spying on. I think the internet router should be moved out I had problems when I first got there It took about 5 hours to get fixed if I had access to the internet box I could have unplugged it and plugged it back in and had internet right away. The owner was aware of it and got someone there as fast as they could as they were out of town.

I loved all of the board game options! The neighborhood was very peaceful during our stay and it isn’t too far from town. Everyone we talked to while we were in town was extremely friendly. Tricia was great to communicate with. She was quick to respond when I had a question or needed something. She knew we were brining our one year old and laid out some special baby soap and wipes for him during our stay, which was so thoughtful and sweet."

Stayed with kids","Tricia's place is definitely in the top 3 of our ""best places we have stayed"". She was very proactive in contacting us, even offering early check-in, although we weren't able to take advantage of it. The house is even larger on the inside than it appears in the photos. We only stayed 1 night so did not really make use of many of the amenities, but it seemed at first glance to have everything necessary, and everything was extremely clean. We spent most of the evening on the deck and were impressed at the lack of bugs despite the proximity to the woods. The hot tub was very clean and worked flawlessly. Our daughter really enjoyed having the entire basement (which is MASSIVE) to herself.
All in all a great stay and we would definitely stay here again!"
