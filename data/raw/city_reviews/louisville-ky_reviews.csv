Stayed a few nights","The place was perfect for my fiancé and I! It was beautiful,clean,homey quiet,peaceful and well located. Janice & Mike had the house stocked with every detail possible you can think of. From shampoo to a lighter in the drawer! Mike greeted us when we got there. He was very nice and helpful! They even left us a gift card to a local bakery! How sweet is that? Our event got canceled on Sunday. We decided to get some food and have a night in the Airbnb. We enjoyed our stay! We will be back when we are back in Louisville and we will recommend to all friends and family. Thank you for having us!"

Large list of restaurant recommendations which we used. We would definitely stay there again as the neighborhood was quiet & close to what we wanted to do."

Stayed a few nights","We really liked this place. It was very tastefully decorated, clean, and had a welcoming, relaxing vibe. A well stocked kitchen and lists of amenities. We didn’t have to communicate much with the hosts once we arrived because everything was so good. Air traffic was a bit noisy one night but I did notice they even had ear plugs available if you needed them. A few restaurants close by and a great location in the central area of Louisville. My only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer. I would definitely recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights",We highly recommend the visit! They are an amazing couple that are very responsive even after we had gotten in very late due to traffic on the expressway. They responded quickly every time. Great information in the folder to help you find exactly what you’re looking for in surrounding areas. The home itself was very comfortable and homey feeling. Everything you could need for a short or long trip was accessible. Highly recommend

Stayed a few nights","I you happen to be visiting Louisville, KY - especially if you have family attending Univ. of Kentucky, you will want to stay here! It's literally down the street! You are less than 5 minutes from the highway, there a restaurants you can walk to - even one that has live music! There is a bakery and coffee shop right across the street! The Place is in a quiet neighborhood. We felt safe and slept great! The back yard has a fire pit and a grill with seating, very private. Inside was very clean and spacious. I love the pocket doors to the bathroom and the sliding barn door to the bedroom. The shower was AMAZING! It's huge and has a rain fall shower head..there is no way you do not feel clean coming out of there. The living area and kitchen were open and had everything we needed. Mike met us and showed how to lock up and where everything was kept. Janice and Mike were great hosts! You will not be disappointed staying here!."

Stayed about a week",I can’t say enough about The Place! I used to come to Louisville regularly for business (pre-pandemic) and fell in love with this spot when I stumbled on it. I was thrilled to see it was available for this week’s last-minute trip. Mike met me at The Place to remind me of the nuances I might have forgotten since my last stay. I was immediately pleased to discover their AirBNB was just as clean and inviting as it had been on my prior visits. This hidden gem is a 5-10 minute Uber rides to most anywhere you want to be in Louisville. It features very convenient on-property parking and super-clean EVERYTHING. I highly recommend staying here if you’re in need of a cool spot in Louisville.

Stayed a few nights","Great location, fantastic hosts! Everything was as pictured in the listing. Host even reached out ahead of time to arrange to meet us at check in. They also provided great recommendations, and some tasty snacks. Even left us a gift card for the bakery across the street. Go early! Great central location to access the many different offerings the city provides. This is a city, you will hear noise, from airplanes, to traffic, to outside passer by's but we felt safe and secure, and enjoyed having the private backyard area. Comfortable furniture, including bed! We will be back if ever in the area."

The sink stopper got stuck down in one of the bathroom sinks, Mike quickly fixed it. We stayed during the Bourbon and Beyond Festival. The location allowed us to ride our bikes to the festival each day without too much trouble. Snacks were a nice touch, as was a gift certificate for the yummy bakery across the street. Would stay here again if visiting Louisville!"

They even took the initiative to write out several locations to visit. The coffee shop and the bakery were our favorites!! Next, we want to go to Mike’s favorite restaurant for breakfast!!
There were snacks left for us and a coupon for the bakery.
Very walkable and very safe neighborhood.
You will not be disappointed!!
This is a true home away from home!

Stayed about a week","We stayed for nine days over Christmas and found the place to be excellent. The lodging is much more spacious than the photos would suggest, with a large well stocked kitchen and ample living space. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of spare linen and towels. The bathroom had a large shower area and included a walk in closet area to hang clothes, additional space to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. There was no shortage of mirrors and the entire apartment was well lit. Mike who met us on check in and walked us through the place is an excellent host, and super responsive. Part of our stay included a major snow storm and he was by after the storm had passed to clear the snow and was thoughtful enough to bring us a snow scraper. All in all this was an excellent visit for us made more enjoyable by ""The Place."""

There were several hand written pages with all Janice & Mike’s local favorites. The Place was warm, inviting, and decorated nicely. The air conditioning worked great, the bed was comfortable, the shower was huge with hot water and good water pressure, and the towels were big and soft. Even though The Place is a unique converted store front on a main street, it was very homey and I heard very little traffic. The back patio was an added bonus and was private and inviting.

The bed was very comfortable and there were extra blankets, sheets and comforters for extra comfort. The bathroom is sleek in design with a huge shower and extra large, very soft towels plus additional supplies if you may forget anything. The kitchen is great and we were given a delicious loaf of cinnamon swirl coffee cake. Coffee was provided and so many extras came with the space. We loved the outdoor space and enjoyed watching the family of bunnies living under the hostas and seeing a variety of birds while having morning coffee on the covered swing. Overall a beautifully designed and decorated space with so many thoughtful touches and details. The absolute best Airbnb and hosts! Thank you so much Mike and Janice you made our stay amazing!"

Great coffee shop and bakery just a stones throw away that make a perfect place to relax first thing in the morning or late in the evenings. If its too busy there you can go back to ""the place"" and enjoy time on the back patio. Would def stay here again in the future should I have to get back to Louisville."

Their thoughtful handwritten local guide made for some wonderfully tasty and beautiful meals and experiences. The way ""The Place"" is layered and laid out with parking off the street and bedroom away from traffic noise really makes this an ideal quiet hideaway tucked away downtown. Loved the utility room washer dryer and spare toilet. Shower was something to behold. Very Comfortable queen size bed with thick and thin pillows. Clean space. Coffee maker. Was a splendid long weekend getaway adventure. Thanks so much!"

When I first arrived with a friend of mine who dropped me there, one of the hosts helped me to know where everything was (plus there were clear instructions on how to use some things on the bulletin board near the kitchen as well). The wifi was also awesome as well.
The only cons I can think of were that I didn’t get to try the bread that they made when I first arrived, and that I couldn’t stay longer..
Otherwise, this has to be my favourite Airbnb to date! Thanks Janice & Mike!!!"

Mike met us upon arrival to walk us through and give us insight and tips for our stay. We were an hour past our original planned arrival time due to weather and traffic on our drive, and Mike was understanding and patient as we kept him updated. Janice left pages of recommendations for local restaurants and pubs, and they also provided cinnamon bread, snacks, bottled water and sodas.
The bed was so comfortable, the shower spacious and the full kitchen spotless. Can't recommend the location enough. We hope to return to Louisville for another weekend getaway and would definitely book The Place again if we have the opportunity."

I also loved all of the extra added touches that made the place feel more like home. I especially appreciated the fluffy bath sheets, comfy bed with high thread count bedding, the amazing shower, and the well stocked kitchen. I was also thankful for Janice and Mike being so understanding as my plane to KY was delayed and then eventually cancelled. After many messages back and forth, I finally arrived around midnight and Mike still met me at the apartment to show me around. This was greatly appreciated after a long and stressful day of traveling. I highly recommend Janice and Mike’s Airbnb! I can guarantee that you will have an awesome stay!"

The place is perfect. It's much larger than the pictures show and very trendy and clean. It reminds me of my lofted condo in Chicago. The extra touches they put in to it, you can tell they really care about their guests stay. The shower is extremely large and on a cold day, very difficult to leave. I was able to cook an entire Thanksgiving meal in the spacious kitchen that has many amenities to use. I also shared with Mike that we would have an extra guest for dinner and he made sure to have an extra chair as well as plates for our guest. The set up allowed us to enjoy our family time together. We will be staying again on our next visit through Louisville. It is also extremely convenient to all of Louisville, especially to get to Bardstown Road stores and restaurants. Thank you for a great time Mike and Janice! You made our Thanksgiving very special for us this year!"

Stayed a few nights","The Place was perfect for a long weekend getaway. Walking distance to a fun little retro-gaming bar and a great coffee shop, and a short ride to dozens of other cool places. Mike & Janice left some great local tips. The place was clean and well-stocked with essentials and thoughtful extras. We came in on a busy weekend, and Mike was extremely flexible and responsive with us in letting us know what was going on. Would recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Janice & Mike's place is amazing...Not far from the convention center and not far from downtown Louisville (about a $6 to $10 Lyft ride, depending on the time of day). My husband and I stayed here because we were working at a convention. It was 1000 times nicer than any of the hotels near the Kentucky Expo Center, and priced much better. They provided beverages, snacks, lists of things to do, extra towels, soaps...oh and my favorite; a picnic basket with a blanket and a flashlight :-D I didnt use it, but it was still a nice touch. This place was fantastic! I would definately stay here again :-)"

From walking in to fresh flowers around the kitchen and living space to delicious cakes and treats set out for our enjoyment, as well as a fully-functioning kitchen and bathroom set up and wonderfully decorated and comfortable bedroom space ~ we can't say enough GREAT things about this home. It was so cozy and felt like home away from home. Mike and Janice have gone ABOVE the top to make sure your stay is incredible. There were even umbrellas by the front door for use on rainy days.

After a day of exploring it was so nice to unwind with a hot bath and a good nights sleep in the very comfortable bed. I stayed almost a week and could’ve happily stayed way longer. Laura was super responsive and answered all my questions with a friendly response. I would definitely recommend this Louisville gem to other travelers!"

The kitchen has a mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave, and a terrific toaster oven: All I needed for my morning bagel and coffee and my evening glass of wine. Ample on-street parking in a quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance of the many great restaurants along Bardstown Road. The apartment is up two flights of stairs - so not handicapped-accessible . Very reasonable cost."

Laura's place was the perfect home base. She provides a sheet of nearby suggestions so you don't have to spend your relaxation time doing neighborhood research. Walk a couple of minutes, and you can browse cool stores and eat tasty food, and for a $10 Uber ride (or an even more affordable bus trip), you can be downtown. Super convenient! Our favorite aspects of this stay were how easy it is to communicate with Laura; how precious and quirky her space is; fun & thoughtful amenities she provides guests; and a bed that helped us get a good night's sleep. We would definitely return."

Stayed with kids","My thirteen year-old nephew and I enjoyed our two-night stay here during a spring break trip to Louisville. The cottage is nicely tucked away in a backyard patio and had everything we needed for a short trip to the area. Space is tight for two, but he loved tucking away for bed up in the loft and the mini-kitchen's fridge, sink and microwave were adequate for our breakfast prep. The loft bed and futon were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and nicely appointed.
If you are traveling solo, the cottage is perfect. If you are a two-person party who can be in a small space together, this will work well.
Lisa is a lovely host and proactively stopped by at check in to make sure everything was okay. She also gave us some helpful suggestions for area restaurants and activities."

Stayed a few nights","I honestly chose for the most value for a week-long stay. What I didn’t anticipate was the intimacy of their travel trinkets, their well-read community books, and the love that went into building this little carriage house.
I used the space to recover from a medical procedure, it offered the ease of access that I needed, and the peacefulness that I wanted.
You can tell that this is more than just a passive income for these hosts, but a part of their heart and travels that they enjoy sharing with other travelers.
I greatly appreciated the hospitality and transparency in communication. And will be happy to save this one for future visits as it is so well-suited for my travel needs in Louisville.
Not to mention Heine Bros (one of my favorite coffee shops) was only 100ft away! Beyond convenient and laughable.

Nice quiet neighborhood, easy walk to coffee and restaurants. Some noises like the ac/heat unit and train gate warning bells down the street, but just pack ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper.

Stayed a few nights","Lisa and her husband were excellent hosts! I was a little disappointed to see that the there was not a real mattress. I was under the impression that the loft bed had a real mattress, but it was more of a hard foam situation (I honestly don’t know). The other option for sleeping is a futon. If you are good with that, then this place is great and I would stay again.
It’s in a great location and walking distance to coffee shops and restaraunts and plenty of street parking. It’s also very clean and well taken care of! For me the bed situation didn’t outweigh all of the pros, but I’m also picky!! I would definitely recommend for a quick, one night stay. I just want other to be aware of the sleeping arrangements but other than that 5 stars!"

Would not have stayed longer due to its size. The ladder going up to the loft was a bit wobbly and mattress up there not too comfortable. She did have an ample supply of snacks in the kitchen and gave us great suggestions for dining in town. Great little place for an overnight stay!"

The only thing I didn’t particularly enjoy was the heat/ac unit sounded like a washing machine with an unbalanced load when it turned on. However, that wasn’t bad enough for it to ruin my trip there.

Take a rain shower in the awesome shower and then enjoy a glass of wine on the beautiful, shady and private patio before strolling down the street a block to fabulous restaurants and nightlife. I felt safely tucked into the cute carriage house at night. Very quiet neighborhood. The hosts are very nice and provide nice snacks, breakfast cereals and bottled water."

Lisa included all of the essential items in the house, such as bedding, towels, soap, etc. She also included cold beverages in the mini fridge, coffee, cereal, and snacks which was generous. Lisa and her husband Helmut were very welcoming to us during our stay, and I highly recommend staying at this spot while in Louisville."

The property was an easy 15 minute drive and we had absolutely no problems thanks to Don and Ron's proactive messaging and very thorough manual/guide! We got to meet their lovely dog Finch and learn all about this amazing piece of history. The surrounds are so peaceful and relaxing, and the restoration/preservation of this historic cabin is a joy to see and also provides all the modern comforts you need. The screened in porch is great, and there are a number of other areas to relax and enjoy the view. A true gem for antique lovers, history lovers, dog and nature lovers. My only regret is that we only booked one night."

The surrounding grounds are beautiful and everything is exactly as it looks in the photographs - it was like stepping back in time (except with better plumbing and HVAC systems).
The cabin’s decor was tastefully done, the bed and other furniture were comfortable, and the kitchen and bath were well appointed. It was also very quiet.
Communication with Donald was excellent, and the guest book has good information on the history of the property along with local recommendations. (I can confirm that the brewery recommendation is spot on.) Finally, I enjoyed meeting his friendly and very well behaved dog!"

Furnishings have been meticulously chosen, suiting the historic feel of the cabin while being comfortable for guests. The bed & bedding were perfect (thank you for the tip on where to buy those sheets! 😊). Donald thoughtfully provided snacks & coffee pods, which we enjoyed on the screened-in porch. The grounds are serenely beautiful. When we saw Donald in the morning, he shared some future plans for the property. We hope to return again to spend some more time enjoying the cabin, the grounds, and the area around Louisville.
Almost forgot: our host provided a detailed list of places to dine, and his recommendations were on point! Highland Morning was our choice for breakfast, and Mussels and Burgers for dinner.

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough about this place! It’s beautifully decorated. Everything is absolutely perfect. It’s like a step back in time, but with modern conveniences. Donald thought of everything. He even provided snacks! It was just perfect! The towels & linens smelled so fresh & clean. The shampoo and soaps he provided were high end. We felt like we were in a five star hotel. It was so peaceful there, we didn’t want to leave. As a matter of fact, we are already planning another visit just so we can stay and enjoy the cottage more. Our favorite was enjoying the fireplace at night. Donald was extremely friendly, responsive, and very helpful with recommendations for local restaurants. If you’re lucky enough to find his cottage available, snatch it up…you won’t regret it. It’s magical."

The interior design is absolutely immaculate. My wife and I described it as feeling like you were in the Chicago Ralph Lauren store - except with better art.
Don and Ron are the best hosts we’ve ever had. Very responsive and proactive. They showed us what true southern hospitality is and actually became our friends. Will come back when back in Louisville."

It is a peaceful and inspiring retreat steeped in history and the interior design is jaw-dropping and museum-worthy. I would love to go back to have the time to wander the property and really get full use of the beautiful outdoor spaces sometime. An excellent place to write your next novel or just daydream.

Stayed one night","The only thing more charming than the pristine cabin were the hosts! The collection of art on the property and immaculate eye for detail immersed us instantly into this gem neatly tucked away in Louisville. The hosts were gracious and helpful and made our stay more incredible than we could’ve imagined! Their recommendations for fine dining were tailored to our tastes and on point! We arrived after sunset and were enchanted by strands of lights that cast a whimsical and mediterranean feel on brick and stone patio. We appreciated the level of attention that had gone into the perfectly manicured grounds. The sounds and sights of the fountain in pond were nothing short of magical. The property was overflowing with a rich tapestry of history and culture. The bed in the cabin was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in! After our visit, we refuse to stay anywhere else in Louisville and are already planning our next visit! Thank you for making our stay one to remember, Donald and Ronnie!"

While the proximity of the property is close to major amenities you still have the sense that you are taken back to the late 1700’s as you sit inside and enjoy the well preserved piece of American history. We can’t thank Donald enough for opening up his home so that we can enjoy this rare gem close to Louisville."

The historic stone cabin was beautifully restored … it had all the modern amenities while still preserving all the original charm and character of the original build. The grounds were beautiful as well, and we really enjoyed exploring the property. The freshly cut wild flowers from the owner’s garden were a great touch. The hosts were very friendly, helpful, and hospitable… always wanting to make sure that our stay was the best that it could be. The owners two dogs were very friendly greeters as well … beautiful members of their family. Great place, great hosts, and great stay! We really look forward to our return."

The history of the home and property coupled with the hospitality of our host far exceeded our expectations. For instance- our flight was delayed causing us to not arrive at the property until 1A, however Donald still greeted us to ensure we had everything we needed. He provided fresh cut flowers and a bottle of wine upon our arrival. The historic home was beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and equipped with all the amenities we could've asked for. The peaceful location, the beauty of the property and the 5-star hospitality will bring my wife and I back to Louisville time and time again."

All of the comments were five star, as are his reviews, and I add my own. This Airbnb is quiet and comfortable with a bed so soft I happily overslept. I have to say someone did a great job decorating the place. The photos are real. The Germantown neighborhood is in the heart of Louisville, minutes from everything and the neighborhood is walkable with interesting and varied amenities all around.

The instructions from Bryan were clear, it was easy to find, and private. The hosts were welcoming without being intrusive. They were responsive. Airbnb can feel very transactional now, but this was a great experience. It felt like how Airbnb was designed - kind and caring people welcoming you into their home. The guest book had local recommendations, and there were more in literature on the coffee table. It was also refreshing to have a minimal check out list. Would highly recommend staying here."

Lots of space inside. Two of us worked remotely for three days inside and there was plenty of room for us spread out. Fast wifi. The bed was large and comfy. The TV is massive. Very well decorated and cohesive look inside. I love the tile in the bathroom and around the fireplace!
Germantown is the best area of Louisville. Tons to walk to including a grocery store just a couple minutes away. Lots of people walking their dogs and riding bikes. Great restaurants and bars nearby you can walk to. Very centrally located if you need to Uber/Lyft to anything.
Bryan and Alexandra checked in with us regularly, we’re very fast to respond, and we’re the kind of hosts you hope you get every time you stay somewhere. Thank you both for being so great!
I would absolutely stay here again."

He was able to accommodate an early check in for us, as we had been traveling for weeks and were exhausted. The neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for after spending a week in the busy parts of Louisville. The suite was easy to find, spotless, tastefully decorated, and relaxing. You are an easy walk from numerous restaurants and bars, only a 10 minute drive to the airport, yet it was quiet and peaceful. Ample street parking as well. 6 stars!"

I met old friends who live in Germantown and waked everywhere. My favorite restaurant was north of bourbon and I loved Haucks bar. Pearl, Nachbar, Merryweather, Post. Everything was so close! But seriously their place was amazing. I loved the decor. I also do a lot of staging and host an Airbnb, and appreciated all their personalized touches, the great and easy level of communication and just how lovely Bryan was. They take their hosting seriously and it sure shows. Keep up the great work guys!! I want to come again sometime if I can ever get away again. It was just so easy and fun.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I travelled to Louisville to celebrate our wedding anniversary and Bryan immediately made us feel so welcome by leaving a hand written note, cookies from a local shop, and a bottle of Prosecco to help us celebrate. Beyond that his place was incredibly clean, stylish, and had everything could need and want from an Airbnb in a great location. Would absolutely return!"

Stayed a few nights","this property is just the best. It is in a perfect location right across the street from the slugger factory, and not far from several great distilleries. Proof on Main was right across the street in case you needed a late night bar. Blackbeard coffee across the street was the perfect cup of coffee. The unit itself was spacious, clean, charming, and had a great view. Save yourself the disappointment of a hotel and book this place."

The gym was beautiful and I used it each morning. The courtyard was also gorgeous. We tried to go to dinner across the street the first night and realized that there was no availability because Jim Gaffigan was in town and was performing at the Palace. That was about a block and a half away (on the same street). So, we bought tickets 30 minutes before the show and had a great time. Then, we walked to the beautiful wine store just down the road and had a lovely dinner after the show back at the apartment. The next day, we walked to the Louisville slugger museum (about a mile away). Thanks for an excellent stay!"

A couple amenities that I really appreciated were the fan in the bedroom ( unexpected but greatly appreciated by someone who sleeps with a fan every night), the travel sized shampoo conditioner and soap, and coffee!

The hosts clearly put a lot of effort into a contemporary renovation in this unit, and we appreciated the attention to detail. Two coffee shops around the corner both offer great options (one has the essential four food groups: coffee | biscuits | muffaletta | whiskey) and we ate at Naive for dinner a block away. Easy to get to and parking was plentiful, even during Bock Fest and a soccer game nearby."

Tornado safety tips, check. Conveniently located in the heart of NuLu, Oliver's home is within walking distance to plenty of shops and restaurants. The space is exactly as described. Very clean and well decorated. We appreciated the small touches (candies and mints at the entrance). Oliver clearly takes pride in hosting, and I can't recommend his place enough."

It has been split into 3 separate units, and we crossed paths with another guest once over the weekend. The neighborhood felt safe, parking was easy, and within walking distance we found a great coffee shop (Quill’s) and had an awesome brunch (Biscuit Belly). Instructions were very clear for check-in and check-out. I was mostly impressed with the binder in the unit that included safety notes, check-in and check-out instructions, and a thorough run-down on local recommendations from bars to restaurants to parks and other activities. Oliver clearly takes pride in hosting his place, and it shows."

You truly do not need a vehicle the whole time. We took an Uber from the airport and walked everywhere else.
This was the perfect and most cozy retreat from our long days touring the Bourbon trails with a tour guide.
Highly recommend this beautiful space and the cost was incredibly reasonable for the amenities.
Oliver was extremely helpful during the whole booking process. And responded quickly to my messages."

The neighborhood was so relaxing and quiet and the location was perfect! We were able to walk to several shops restaurants and distilleries within minutes."

The place was clean and stocked with all the little things you forget. It’s right around the corner from a bunch of different eateries but not so close you get the traffic. We had no issue finding parking at any point in our stay. I will definitely be on the look out for availability the next time I’m traveling to Loo-a-vul!

The Big 4 Bridge is close at hand and should be enjoyed. I recommend you include lunch on the Indiana side of the Ohio River during your walk. Scenery from the bridge is spectacular.
The unit does not have a full kitchen, but I didn’t plan to cook, so that was OK. The hosted are very responsive to any questions and helpful."

Parked our car (on the street around the corner there is plenty of free parking) and never moved it, because we walked everywhere.
Walked 30 minutes to the farthest distillery, Peerless Distilling, highly recommended. Hit all of them on the way back: Michters, Evan Williams, Old Forester, and Angel’s Envy. The final distillery, Rabbit Hole is only a few blocks from home.
Several breweries within walking distance, too.
Had a minor issue. Emailed the host and he solved it within minutes.

Probably the best communication I’ve ever had with an Airbnb host in my life! He checked to make sure I got in okay, checked on my in the middle of my stay, and then reached out after check out to make everything went smooth. Unfortunately my partner forgot her tennis bracelet at the apartment, I messaged Oliver about it and within an hour he had found it and responded to get it back to me.

Karen and Bryan were in their yard when I arrived and were friendly and helpful . They have created such a beautiful space and I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay ! Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We got in on Friday evening and left Monday morning. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and place for our first Airbnb stay. Karen & Bryan were very communicative from the start and answered all my questions. The description and pictures of the carriage house could NOT be more accurate. It was perfect for a long weekend, but would also be great for much longer stays as there's pretty much anything you could need. We were even able to do laundry before we left so we could bring clean clothes home! We also loved that it was a stand-alone unit, and we had the garage as well. The ONLY thing I would caution renters of (and suggest that it be added to the description) is the length limitation for vehicles fitting into the garage. We have a Ford F150 with a 5.5' bed, and we literally only had a few to spare to be able to close the door. It would be worth asking for measurements if you have a pickup or even a longer SUV. Overall, very clean and well-maintained. A+!"

Stayed a few nights","I travel a lot and was so impressed with Karen and Bryan's place. The pictures looked exactly as it was. The location is close to major highways, downtown, gas stations and a Kroger's within minutes which is important when you have a place with a kitchen. Having a garage to park in was great so there was no wondering if I would get a parking space somewhere. There was everything (and more) in the kitchen including a Ninja blender which I used for smoothies. I can't stress enough that this is the place to stay in Louisville. I did have a chance to speak with Bryan and he was extremely friendly, outgoing, and helpful. The kitchen had some spices, cooking spray, tin foil, etc. And in case you may have forgotten something, check the drawer under the bathroom sink, you might find what you need in there. All around, made for a perfect 5-day trip to Louisville. Thank you for having a wonderful place for travelers to stay in your city."

Great bed/pillows, plenty of towels, loved the bathroom heater, & two bedside tables w chargers is always a bonus! Restaurant North of Bourbon is 5 min walk—food was good, but service so-so/overpriced for the evening. Everything was 10-15 min from Airbnb which was great! We went Fri night to the Louisville Pumpkin Spectacular (park on side street & walk); Sat to the KY Derby Museum, & then saw comedian Jim Gaffigan at The Louisville Palace (public parking behind Palace $5)."

Only a 10 minute drive to downtown. Private garage to park in. The guidebook they provide is full of wonderful suggestions, several we totally followed. Something else I appreciated was that they had no wacky requirements like some places do. This will be the first place I check for availability the next time we go to Louisville.

The garage is down a one-lane brick road so the squeeze to park larger cars is pretty tight. I found backing in works best. The apartment is well furnished and beautiful, with some extra touches some hosts wouldn't think to include. The kitchen in particular had everything you could need to cook a good meal. The shower is very luxurious, better than the one I have at home. The apartment is quiet and private, perfect for a cozy night in or for coming back to after a long night out. Give them a go!

It was just the right size for the two of us. They had everything you could possibly need. Great and responsive host! We didn’t have any issues but if we did I felt confident the issue would be resolved promptly.

We enjoyed using the kitchen, the bathroom was clean and roomy, bed was comfortable, living room space was also very nice. Little things like snacks and drinks were appreciated. Loved the heater in the bathroom as it was chilly while we were in town. A lot of care went into making this a great Airbnb."

This was our first visit to the area and we were able to find our way around easily enough and there are a ton of recommendations and a wonderful welcome book in the suite. The suite itself was just perfect for me and my husband. Plenty of space, super comfortable and while there is some noise from either dogs or the ""planes, trains and automobiles"", we quickly got used to them (we live next to an airport at home). We did have to leave a day early thanks to the Nor'easter that hit NY, which was a bummer but communication was easy. The bed was comfortable and they helped to make me a sparkling water convert with the extra touches they have in the suite! We highly recommend Karen and Bryan's place and their communication was phenomenal. :-) Thanks for a pleasant stay!"

It was clean and had so many nice features about it. We came to visit for a motorcycle event we had and the garage was perfect for our two big bikes. When we wanted to go downtown but didn’t want to drive there were electric scooters to rent close by. There is a few good places to eat and drink around the area. We felt safe and that our stuff was safe. The owner’s had excellent communication with everything and were quick with any reply’s. I would definitely recommend this to any friends or family. The price also was perfect for us it was better than a lot of hotel rooms even. If we come back to that area we will be booking with them again.

It’s definitely in a convenient location to get to Churchill Downs or attractions downtown. We stayed two nights, and on our second night we did have some trouble sleeping due to airplane noises nearby. Just something to keep in mind if you’re particularly light sleepers like we are! There is a white noise machine provided next to the bed, which we appreciated and was a thoughtful touch. Overall a great stay and we’d recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in Louisville!"

Stayed a few nights",What an absolutely fantastic place to stay in while you’re visiting Louisville. I would highly recommend it and we will definitely use it again when I come back to visit. Charming clean and one of the best places we’ve stayed since using Airbnb

Stayed a few nights","This sweet, airy quiet apartment is a real gem! We absolutely loved staying here. It is super-clean, charming and comfortable. The Germantown neighborhood was a real revelation, with fun restaurants and coffeshops within walking distance or a short drive away. Hosts were extremely helpful and provided great information about the area. There is a safe place to park, a nice little nook of an outdoor space to enjoy, and a well-equipped kitchen. I can't recommend this place enough, and would definitely try to stay here again on our next visit to Louisville!"

Stayed a few nights","The carriage house is beautiful and has all of the conveniences of home! Washer/dryer, dishwasher, microwave, Coffee maker/pods, etc. It is a short drive to the distilleries, downtown restaurants, Churchill Downs and other tourist attractions. We loved the small little surrounding neighborhoods as well. Lots to do and see! We would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute space. The only drawback was we thought it would be closer to restaurants, etc. Ok though as we had a car. Close to airport. We would stay again. Karen was responsive to our questions."

Stayed with a pet","The River View was the epitome of serenity. This is a historical location in close proximity to local food, shopping, and attractions. Why stay at a hotel when you can book this beautiful well kept cabin that provides you with everything you could ever need for a peaceful and relaxing experience. Kellie is a wonderful host and makes you feel as if you are in a home away from home. I will absolutely stay here again when I am passing through the area."

Stayed a few nights","Great host and an amazing place! If this place is available, book it, you won’t be disappointed. The cabin is very peaceful and they had all amenities. We worked in Louisville, and the 30min commute was well worth it, we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I gave 5 stars only because 10 stars wasn’t an option! This place was amazing. It was secluded, safe, and peaceful. We were in town for the Kentucky Derby. Easy drive in and out, was so nice to out of the hustle and bustle after being at the track all day. The house had everything we needed and then some. Super clean, downstairs bed was comfy- did t stay upstairs and just as described and would 100% stay here again. Kellie checked in on us and made our stay personal to us. Great hostess!"

Stayed with kids","Like I said to the host when we left, the fact that we were genuinely sad to leave says it all. The property is spectacular. The home is beyond perfect. We enjoyed every moment of almost three weeks in this beautiful spot. The sunrises, the privacy, the incredibly friendly hosts…. We will be back for sure!!"

Stayed with a pet","This home is beyond spectacular!!! I just wish I would have booked it for longer. Every detail has been considered to make your stay perfect. The host, Kellie, was terrific and beyond helpful. The whole house was spotless and well stocked. I even cooked soup and was thrilled to find a peeler for carrots. If you are looking for a peaceful, one of a kind setting this is it. A mile off the paved road, it is a gorgeous, tranquil setting. With two porches, we caught multiple barges driving by on one porch and the sunrise on the other porch. We even spotted a bald eagle over looking the river. Do not hesitate to rent this place. You will not want to leave!"
