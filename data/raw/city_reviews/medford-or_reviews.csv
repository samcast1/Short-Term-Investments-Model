Stayed with a pet",This was a great midway stop for our family trip. Located in a nice quiet neighborhood. The home is clean a felt well cared for. You can tell this home is managed by a person who cares rather than a property manager/company. The pillows and mattresses ae very comfortable. Everything we needed was readily available and easy to find. Kathryn even made sure to put out a doggie basket of necessities. We enjoyed our stay so much that we stayed again on our way back home. Would highly recommend Kathryn and her airbnb if you're in the Medford area.

The house is very cute - our girls loved the bunk bed, and it was nice that there were food and water bowls and a bed for our little dog. Thermostat easy to operate. All in all it was a very restful experience."

Stayed with kids","Very cute place in a peaceful neighborhood. The host was very responsive and helpful. I wanted to give it 5 stars but as soon as we walked in we noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana. A little bit I can deal with, it’s Oregon! But this was way too much to be comfortable in the space. There was a small air purifier provided, but it did nothing. The host assured me that this was not the norm and it must have been from previous tenants. Other than this one hitch our stay was good."

She lost left out some dog supplies, bowls for food and water, a (small) bed and a few other things for the pup.
The location felt safe and we were already familiar with the area as we used to live nearby. There are some excellent restaurants a short drive away.
Thanks Kathryn! Be staying in one of you rentals again soon!"

Stayed with a pet",Kathryn’s home was exactly what I needed. I was visiting Medford for my pup to have an emergent orthopedic surgery so the step-free entrance made the house really accessible. We didn’t explore the backyard as my pup couldn’t do the stairs but the deck looked like it would be really enjoyable on a warm sunny day. Kathryn was very kind and welcoming to my big pup and even checked in to see how the surgery went. The house was very comfortable with memory foam mattresses. The neighborhood felt safe and was very quiet. We felt right at home there.

Group trip","Great cottage and pictures do not do it justice. Even nicer in person. Very clean cottage, comfortable, and quiet neighborhood. Kathryn was very responsive and helpful. :)
A couple of things that could be improved. The back slider lock didn't seem to work and there was a piece of wood in the jam to secure it. I assumed that is why the wood was in place. I let Kathryn know about the lock and she offered to take a look at it, but I didn't see her message until the night before we left. So a bit unsettling, but she was quick to respond. Also, no blinds or curtains on the back window or slider. I would absolutely recommend window covering for privacy. Especially since we showed up at night. Window covering are a must."

The neighborhood is very quiet and the few planes that flew over were more fun than annoying. We spent hours on the deck in the morning even during days that were in the high 90s. We floated the Rogue, spent several nights watching sunsets from county parks along the river, hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, visited Crater Lake Natl Park, and say a show at the Britt Festival in historic Jackonsville. Kathryn was extremely responsive and helpful."

There was a way to separate our bedroom from the rest of the house so we could get from the bedroom to the bathroom privately if we needed in the middle of the night, which was nice. they had a friendly pup, a continental breakfast, and it was just an overall great place to stay."

Stayed about a week","Lillian and Bill are the gold standard! A private room with its own bath in the next room, both in their own wing of the home. It was a very comfortable home-like setting for a week-long class I took in Ashland. Quiet area which made studying in the evenings very nice and painless. Loved the fresh bread in the morning! Marley is an older, small-to-middle sized dog who is friendly, quiet and a non-jumper--very nice company! Lovely people to visit with who had nice recommendations for restaurants and activities. Everything was wonderful, thank you so much for a great week!"

The stay with them was how Airbnb should be, part of a house where you learn about the people you are staying with and enjoy their hospitality. Bill and Lillian were the perfect example of this, chatting when we were all around but also giving me space if I needed to work or do my own thing. They became people I know not just a place I stayed.
If you are ever in Medford, please do yourself a favor and stay with these amazing people (and their amazing dog!)"

Stayed one night","I stayed with Lillian and Bill on my way from WA to CA. They very kindly offered to let me park in their garage since I was fully loaded with stuff. However, the neighborhood felt very safe so I just parked on the street and had no issues. This was my first time staying in a home with the host on site. It was a little awkward (wrong) feeling just letting myself into their home without knocking first However, Lillian (and Marley the dog who is sweet as can be) greeted me very shortly after I arrived, and was very warm and I felt instantly welcomed and right at home. So for anybody who is hesitant to stay on site with a host let me assure you this is a great place to start. You do feel like you have complete privacy with the bedroom and bathroom being separate from their area. I took an evening walk enjoying the beautiful homes and gardens in the neighborhood and read my book on the front porch until dusk. Very rejuvenating after a long drive. I would definitely stay here again."

Also loved having a robe, was like a hotel and made it easy to unwind after a long day of driving. Quiet and easy to get to sleep. Well situated in the house for privacy. Note that the mattress is a pillow-top, it is a bit soft for those of us who prefer a firm mattress. Still got a great sleep and a 5-star stay. Chatted with Lillian in the morning -- friendly and felt very comfortable. Would stay again if going thru Medford."

I am grateful that they let me use their garage since I have a bunch of stuff in my car. Lilian and I also briefly talked during breakfast, which was great!"

I imagine that they take note of what each guest needed and added it to their list of amenities. Everything was spotless and comfortable, comfortable not just physically, but in the atmosphere and ambiance as well. Lillian and Bill are the personas of hospitality; and their dog Marley contributes to that, too. I hope to stay with them again in the future."

Stayed one night","Lillian’s and Bill’s place is very special. They are very thoughtful hosts. It shows that Lillian puts much thought when preparing your room and stay. They are gracious and welcoming hosts. For me it was the cozy bed, filtered water in the room, access to the kitchen and a nice little breakfast set out for me, everything I could possibly need in the bathroom, and a sitting chair for my writing, reading, or enjoying my coffee. There are a couple nice chairs on the porch as well, to take in the beautiful neighborhood.
Lillian and a bill are very friendly and interested in their quests and making them comfortable. Their pup, Marley is shy but adorable. Being in the home of musicians is fun for me and a home with welcoming people is what Airbnb is all about. I will definitely return to their place. Would like to stay longer than one night next time,."

Stayed a few nights","Lillian and Bill are fabulous hosts and their home is incredibly warm and welcoming. It is cozy, comfortable, and decorated with a great assortment of art from their travels. The bed was delightfully comfortable, the room nice and bright with a good writing desk and a really comfortable arm chair for reading. I really liked that the bedroom and bathroom are at the other end of the house from their rooms and the kitchen/dining area. It was wonderfully private, but just off the front room, so didn't feel too set apart. Everything was very much like visiting family or friends, which is what appeals to me the most about Airbnb. Lillian and Bill are both so personable and interesting: you'd do yourself a disservice if you stayed with them and didn't get to chatting! I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in. They have a great front patio area, which has lovely shade and plants and cushioned chairs, very nice for enjoying their quiet, residential neighborhood. There are some delicious restaurants and coffeehouses within a quick, 15-minute walk, if that: less than a mile away. You could easily walk into downtown Medford in 20 minutes or so of happy ambling through one of my favorite neighborhoods in town: older, tree-lined streets, beautiful Craftsman and turn-of-the-century homes, little bungalos, even a few cobbled streets. It's a great walk into, say, Ruby's on Genessee. Lillian and Bill have clearly curated their home to be a home away from home. There is nothing at all that feels anonymous or ""hotel-like"" about their place. Marley the dog makes a great greeter, as well."

I can go a step further and just say that I have easily spent 100’s of dollars on 5 star hotels and not had this nice of experience. The place is cozy and wonderful in every way. They think of every single thing it seems and really go the extra effort to make you feel at ease.
They are first class people that I am honored to know and so happy I was able to get that time there with them. Superior experience and highly recommended to anyone who finds themselves in Medford for a couple of nights or couple of months. You won’t regret it!"

Stayed one night","My girlfriend and i passed through here so we could have a nights rest on our way from Bishop, CA to Seattle, WA. We figured it’d be like the last airbnb we stopped at where we’d get our own silo and leave the next morning, but we were very pleasantly surprised by how friendly our 3 hosts were and how thoughtful the airbnb was. Accessibility in the showers, plenty of cleaning supplies, and local recommendations are just a few of the ways they considered their guests’ potential needs. Hopefully you can stop by and find out what the rest are!"

The beds were comfy, we were able to destress in the living room before another driving trek, and the kitchen is great whether cooking or ordering out.

Very welcoming of pets. They provided pet food dishes, an extra leash and waste bags, and many pet beds strewn throughout the house. The backyard is well-fenced with no holes or gaps that even our tiny (11-ish pounds) dog could wriggle through.
Kitchen has all the basics, as well as a good selection of herbal teas.

The queen bed is unfortunately not great- so squeaky that my partner and I ended up sleeping in separate beds so we could actually get some rest and stop waking each other up.

I’m a light sleeper and tend to move around frequently throughout the night and the squeaking woke me up a lot. The mattress was very comfortable, though. If it wasn’t for the squeaking bed frame, I’d give it five stars."

Stayed a few nights","Adorable pet friendly house with only 1 downside.
This house is on a cute, quiet street. The backyard is adorable and fenced in. I didn't bring a dog but this would be the perfect place to stay with a pet. Kitchen has everything you need to cook meals, which I really appreciated. Bathroom was super cute and well provisioned.
Now for the downside: the bed in the main bedroom was so squeaky and uncomfortable. It kept me up all night. I had to buy earplugs halfway through my stay because the bed was so loud. Any toss or turn in the middle of the night would wake me up. Huge bummer. The only dark spot in an otherwise perfect place."

Stayed overnight after a long drive from Northern California. The house was immaculately clean and had a fenced backyard, which was greatly appreciated given I was traveling with my two dogs. Wren was very responsive in her communication. I highly recommend Wren's cottage if you're passing through the area or looking for a place to stay in Medford."

Stayed one night",We’ve stayed at Maryls before and it was perfect. We love the peaceful area. Cozy and perfect for an over night stay. Maryl came over to greet us and offer a doggy blanket for the sofa. We bring our own but it was nice to meet her. She left homemade brownies and some drinking water in the frig which was very thoughtful as we always have to bring a gallon of water on our trip. Most rentals don’t provide drinking water. We will stay again if Maryl continues to offer her cottage to fur baby owners like us. Thank you Maryl.

Maryl's cottage is clean and quiet with a very nice bed. Maryl is a delightful host, very communicative, flexible, and eager to please her guests. The cottage is pet friendly. However, the cottage is small and older, probably most appropriate for a single person, or a couple for one or two nights. The washstand is in the bedroom, not the bathroom."

Stayed with a pet","The cottage at Maryl’s place was very clean and well located. And, we found Maryl to be happy, kind and helpful.
The cottage is quite small if traveling with a lot of stuff. We were on a 2 week roadtrip so had luggage, cooler, pet supplies etc., so it felt quite small for the two of us and our pup. Maybe most people wouldn’t travel with this much stuff, so the size would be fine. We were surprised by the shared courtyard. I believe it must have been listed, but I somehow overlooked it. Just wanted to mention this in case others might miss this too. We had a couple of challenges while there, so left a day early. Renters from this date on can look forward to a new air-conditioning unit that Maryl is having installed. We would recommend Maryl’s cottage to others. She is a kind and gracious host."

Stayed with a pet",Maryl has made her cozy cottage and lovely patio so inviting and dog friendly! Maryl’s thoughtful organization made our stay easy and pleasant. We had everything we needed tucked neatly into a small space. The bed is super comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. Maryl is delightful and we look forward to returning and staying longer next time to further explore Jacksonville. Five stars all around. Thank you Maryl!

Stayed with a pet","Maryl's cottage was a great stay while traveling through Jacksonville with our dog. Just a short drive from the center of town, it was easy to find with parking just outside the gate. Check-in was simple, and once inside we were surrounded by lush vegetation that made the cottage feel like an oasis. It was very comfortable for our overnight stay, and the enclosed patio ensured a secure place for our dog to go outside. Definitely on our list of dog-friendly places to visit."

This place is so cute and quaint, and perfectly situated far enough away from town that you don’t hear the hustle and bustle, but close enough to where you can walk to the local pubs and restaurants.
Inside, we found blankets for our furry friend, and snacks for ourselves and plenty of cold water in the fridge. Also, the bed in this place could not be more comfortable.
We will be back for another stay next time we are in Jacksonville."

Stayed with a pet","We recently moved to Salem, but I had to come back for a medical procedure. Maryl's place just as she described it would be! When we entered the little courtyard to the cottage we were delighted. Green plants everywhere, a fountain, a little table and chairs with an umbrella. As we entered the Airbnb, we were greeted by the smell of fresh baked cookies. After we unpacked, we each ate a cookie and at the same time we said, ""Man! These cookies are amazing!"" Then we ate the rest of those delicious cookies! We only wished that there had been about a dozen more!! The cottage was very clean and tidy throughout. I went out into the courtyard at night, it was BEAUTIFUL with all of the lights! The host left notes inside to tell you how to work this and that was helpful. The bed was also VERY comfortable! We both got a great night's sleep. As we were leaving in the morning, we met our delightful host. Maryl is a wonderful lady! We will be definitely staying here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We drove from over 800 miles in one day from San Diego, Ca. and arrived in the early evening. We were both tired from the long drive up and were relieved to know that the check in was flexible and we had to do was to walk right in since the door was left unlocked for us. When we arrived we found a very cozy cottage that was tucked away in a peaceful area of the neighborhood. The entrance was through a very lovely patio surrounded by ivy and with a small working fountain. We had all the amenities included in the cottage that we would need during our stay there. The cottage was so arranged that the moment you entered it you felt like you were at home. Maryl was an excellent hostess and had prepared for our stay. I didn't get a chance to meet and talk with her until we were just getting ready to leave on our last morning. She was very gracious and given us a very nice stay there in her cottage. Will be looking forward to staying there again in the future when we come back again."

Prior to our arrival she contacted us with a kind and personal greeting. We use Airbnb a lot and very few hosts make personal contact. Maryl is refreshing. We stayed overnight because of a drs appointment. The cottage was perfect for us all. A soft lovely doggie blanket for Auggie who loves fluffy things to sleep on. And wonderful chocolate chip homemade cookies just the way I like them, chewy, chocolatey and nutty. It was cold but the cottage was warm toasty and cozy. Trails near by. We’ll be back. Thank you Maryl."

Stayed one night","My wife and I enjoyed our short stay in Maryl's cottage. Everything just fits with the small, tasteful Jacksonville feel - easy swinging gate into a front sitting courtyard, decor and night lights spread throughout, low traffic hiking trail within a quarter mile, homemade cookies waiting for us inside - we loved it! It was a bit of a walk to downtown Jacksonville, taking about 20-25 minutes at a comfortable walking pace. Thank you, Maryl!"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy Jacksonville Cottage is just perfect! Suites one or two adults with or without behaved pet. The cottage is basically two rooms, plus shower. Kitchenette is simple with a small fridge (think dorm size), a hot plate and microwave. The sitting area is also in that room. The Cottage is very comfortable. The cost, very affordable. Importantly, as a single, I felt very safe!
Parking is close, on the same level, so no lugging heavy luggage far at all! Maryl, the friendly and nice hostess, makes check in and check out simple (one less thing to worry about). You'll also find a homebaked surprise on the kitchenette counter when you arrive. A point to note, altho' the hostess lives adjacent to the cottage, no one is the least bit intrusive. Welcoming? Yes!
The cottage is in a great location, just one half mile from ""town"" an easy walking distance. I found three area's for a morning walk near by. One is just down the street from the Cottage; enjoy the deer! Then there is the Beekman Aboretum and the Britt Garden (woods). Each are a gentle walk from the Cottage.
The Cozy Cottage is aptly located for the Britt Fest events, too, just 0.6mi away.
Some favourite places I explored for food each have Gluten Free options (I know, I ate them!)
The Good Bean for coffee & a muffin, breakfast or lunch.
The Jacksonville Inn has three dining areas (and an oh-so fabulous beet salad).
UmI Sushi - hand made as you order. Yummm
Being in wine country is always fun and South Stage Cellars is on the corner. I'm so glad I stopped there! All of these eateries are just a half mile from the Cozy Jacksonville Cottage. FYI - Medford is a 20 min drive, Ashland is 30 minutes.
I'm looking forward to my next trip to discover more about Jacksonville and I hope to stay at the Cozy Cottage!"

Stayed with a pet","I only stayed at Kathryn’s place for a night! Driving from Seattle with dogs and needing a place to stay for the night, I was willing to stay just about anywhere. I’m glad it was Kathryn’s place!
Even at nearly 10pm at night, the place was easy to locate. The instructions with photos made finding it in the dark so much more easier - I can only imagine what it was like in the daylight! The yard was wonderful for my pups for stretch their legs.
When I entered the space felt very spacious for me and two medium / large dogs. Everything that was included was thoughtful, and the space was beautiful.
If I wasn’t so keen on getting back on the road I would’ve enjoyed my full stay, and stayed longer.
I did hear planes, but for me it wasn’t a problem! Reminded me of home.
Nevertheless, would stay here again! Thank you so much 🤍"

The eco friendly products and bonus charcoal bamboo toothbrush and tablet toothpaste was generous and a good way to introduce folks to alternative options. Thank you!
The neighborhood was quiet and a huge open space and park for the pup was super close.
The only thing that might be a struggle for some folks that I was surprised wasn’t mentioned, is that it’s right near the airport (had no idea Medford had an airport) so the landing plans flew really low above the house every hour or so into the night. This was startling and a bit annoying for us at first and our pup didn’t love it. Manageable and not a complaint, a great overall stay, but just a heads up for more sensitive folk.
Thank you Kathryn."

Stayed with a pet","Very clean and accommodating. Had sort of last minute stay because our nearby home was having a floor repair. This was perfect, 2 twenty pound cats and a little 9 pound dog were easily accommodated with us for three days. Everyone was comfy.
Two suggestions are that you could -
1) oil or finish the cute kitchenette so it easier to keep clean without water spotting and remove the teflon frying pan since it's not compatible with the induction burner, and
2) let people know to approach the driveway at an angle so your vehicle doesn't scrape. Our Prius was so low it was difficult until we figured that out.
Very cute and tasteful decorating. Loved the shower soap. Thanks so much!

- There was a surprising amount of space inside. The photos don’t do it justice! It was just perfect for us and two large dogs.
- For being a converted garage, whoever did the remodel did an impressive job. Grout lines were clean, doors were flush, fixtures were nice, not cheap and flimsy.
- Lovely selection of herbal teas
- Offered to do our dishes for us if we left them behind
These, in addition to all that was stated in previous reviews, are some of the reasons we will definitely stay here again!"

The kitchen area has a mini fridge, microwave, and all that is described…
The bed is super soft and comfy and there is a place for two to dine and watch the smart TV.
There are extra blankets underneath the bed, I believe.
There’s a large bathroom with linens and a shower with good water pressure…
The house in front is also an Airbnb, though it feels private at the studio.
Kathryn responded quickly when asked any question and is really sweet.
We highly recommend Kathryn’s place for a nice, quiet stay."

TheAirbnb itself was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. I especially appreciated that there were extra pillows. The Airbnb is private and is completely fenced off which is wonderful if you plan on bringing your puppy, like we did."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place to stay in Medford. You can avoid the hotels and busy intersections and noisy truck traffic and enjoy a quiet neighborhood. It's just the right size for a couple, maybe someone with one child, and looks to be very dog friendly (water bowl, bed, leash, toys, and enclosed yard). All the finishes and furnishings were like-new and the place is tastefully decorated. The mini-kitchen is usable for quick snack or breakfast, but not really setup for making larger meals, but it's fully stocked (nice selection of teas and coffee) and was more than fine for our visit. The heat and AC worked great (we actually needed both this trip - and way quieter than a hotel unit). It's only a 5 min drive to downtown or the south shopping center and a quick 20 minute drive to Ashland if you are heading to OSF. Great coffee (hi Noble in Ashland) is right down the block at Forage. Highly recommend and will definitely seek out for our next visit."

Very comfortable bed. There's no desk, but there are laptop tables so you can easily work from the couch. There's a private outdoor patio with a lovely container garden, with plenty of outdoor furniture so you can sit and relax.
The host is right nearby in case of any questions, and very responsive. He also gave me a great recommendation for a local coffee shop nearby. Definitely a spot I'd stay in again."

I was so impressed how well-designed this space was for beauty and functionality, from artwork on the walls to thick towels and comfortable linens and bed. When I had my hands full walking to the door, there was a table just where I needed it to put my things down. There were beautiful windows overlooking their garden for when I was working in the living room space and then a table outside in the garden surrounded by the loveliest collection of plants where I enjoyed my meals. And delicious food and the library within walking distance. I wish every airbandb was just like this one! These are great hosts!!"

As I said, not critical, but I would love to have had a bit more firmness in the mattress and a bit more warmth on top of me! I love the well-appointed, well-supplied, well designed place."

Stayed a few nights","I had a very comfortable stay. I was in town for two nights for work. The space is cozy with nice decorative touches, very clean, easy to find, off-street parking, about a 10 minute walk to the cute downtown of Medford. The private garden space with tons of potted plants and Adirondack chairs was a nice place to unwind at the end of the day. The hosts were friendly and communicative. They live next door and give you plenty of privacy, but are available if you need anything. You do share a wall with the front unit in the house. It wasn't loud, but if there are other guests you may hear light ""neighbor noises"". It was not a bother, just something to be aware of if that is something you are sensitive to. I recommend Ronald's place! Thanks for hosting me."

Stayed with a pet","First off I came in very late at night and the host was aware of my late arrival time. Kathryn’s property was well lit with a lit walk way to the home. The porch light was also on. Along the walk way was a lovely garden.
Coming in the home was clean, smelt good but no strong perfume odors and felt welcoming. Minimum clutter and modern amenities. The bathroom was large for a tiny home. There’s a lot of windows so it feels much bigger. All with wooden blinds. The bed was large and very cushy. You sink right in. As someone who needs more support in a bed it was personally to cloud like for me but I’m sure a lot more people would appreciate it if you’re into that. It was a great bed just not great for me.
I had brought my dog with me. She was welcomed with a leash, poop bags, a water bottle and a food bowl. I was very grateful for how dog friendly this home was. I got a look at their dog on property who seemed very well behaved and had no reactions to my dog at all.
I would book again."

Stayed one night","This tiny house was very cozy! I could have stayed in that bed all day!!!!The bathroom was small but very functional and the shower was great. The wifi was good and the streaming services worked quite well. Communication with the hosts was excellent.
If there are two of you and you like to read a real book at night, I suggest that you bring a clip on book light. Otherwise the person near the wall won't be able to read (there is an overhead light above the bed but it is too bright for reading, and you'd have to climb out of bed to turn it off.) I just invested in these after this trip - tiny spaces are so wonderfully cozy but they don't always have enough space to place reading lights on both sides of the bed."

The tiny house is pure perfection from the natural garden filled with pumpkins to pomegranates,
to bird/bee loving colorful flower and trees ! (BTW the bees were not near the Eco-tiny house,
nor were they a problem anywhere!)
Easy to find, quiet, cozy, everything thoughtfully and beautifully placed and provided, perfectly clean,
EVERYTHING you could possibly need or want; plus a wonderfully comfortable bed. (pillows and linen were heaven). And then there was the organic fair-trade yummy array of teas, coffee AND even stamp sealed TP - impressive ;) !
It's obvious Kathryn, her family (and helpers) all love and care for their home and the planet.
Beautiful experience - I'll be back, next time hopefully to share it with my husband."

Be aware although the bed is VERY comfortable the way it is situated one person will have to climb over the other to get out of bed in the night. Also, the walk way up to the porch is made of chunks of asphalt with space between so be careful where you step and rolling suitcases don’t roll so well."

My bestfriend and I were travelling from Washington to California and decided to cut the drive halfway through (Medford, Oregon). Found this gem of a place and everything written on the description is up to par with what you would expect once you get there. It was easy to find, the place was very comfy and homey, and it felt like the host thoroughly planned each detail ahead for the guests' needs. We drove for almost 10hours and as we arrived, we immediately felt a sense of rest (as though we've already returned home). We capped off the night with a complimentary tea (lots to choose from) and relaxed with some YouTube music in the background/a short Netflix show episode before bedtime. The host is very responsive to my inquiries and the price is so worth it. 20 out of 10 experience - definitely recommend this place!"

Stayed one night","We spent only one night in the tiny house and met a friend for dinner; so, we did not cook any meals there, but from what I observed, everything was provided to be able to do so. There were many thoughtful touches. The three of us had a good nights sleep and enjoyed our time there."

Stayed one night","We love tiny houses, and this one did not disappoint! The interior is modern, carefully thought out, and everything was very clean. So much better to stay here on a road trip than a motel. Absolutely would visit again.
My only complaint is that the bed was very, very soft."

Stayed a few nights","Kathryn's tiny house was such a sweet place for our quick stay in Medford. It was so quaint and perfect for our needs. Kathryn also was very accommodating, allowing us to check-out late so that we didn't have to kill too much time before heading to a wedding not too far away. Thanks so much for that flexibility!!"

Stayed with a pet",Kathryn’s eco-tiny home was special and wish we could’ve spent a bit more time seeing the area and utilizing the great tiny space! Well designed and thought out it had everything we needed and a very comfortable bed to rest up on our road trip from the Bay Area to Seattle! Thank you so much for the great stay and the charging for our Tesla!

Stayed with a pet","This place was amazing. Perfectly described.
I wanted something away from the normal hotel experience, calm, and peaceful. This provided my dog and I everything. There was even a dedicated parking spot.
Inside was warm and inviting. All amenities were available. Sweet and cozy. I enjoyed all the natural light, but can be controlled by the blinds.
We stayed two days. I walked my dog around the block and the neighbors were great.
It was nice to be so close to many stores and parks.
I will stay here next time in town."

All the information we needed about location, how to get in, how to adjust the heat/cooling system and where to find everything might have had questions about was provided well ahead of our arrival. We enjoyed a very pleasant time there."

Private tiny home which had everything we could need and was perfect for our dogs too. Would highly recommend to any small families or couples traveling in the quaint Medford area.

Kathryn is so kind and friendly, and the place itself has always been clean and cozy. Despite being small, it doesn't feel tight at all. Our dog loves it too! Neighborhood is perfect for taking them on a walk."

The little kitchenette is well stocked, everything was sparkling clean. The perfect stop over on my road trip. Parking off street was nice, and the walking path along the creek was refreshing. Highly recommend and would stay here again!"

Stayed one night","""We recently had the pleasure of staying at Kathryn's Airbnb, and we cannot express how much we loved our experience. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the property, and it was clear that the hosts had gone above and beyond to ensure that our stay would be comfortable and enjoyable.
The accommodations were simply perfect - beautifully furnished and equipped with all of the amenities we needed to feel right at home. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and we slept soundly each night. Additionally, the property was impeccably clean and well-maintained, making our stay all the more pleasant."

We were moving so our car was packed full so the parking on the property was helpful and also made us feel better about leaving belongings in the car!

Stayed with a pet","Kathryn's mini-house was perfect for a 2 day stayover, and I was impressed with how many amenities they were able to fit into such a small space-- the house uses its space incredibly well! They have cookware and a portable cooktop, dishes, coffee-making-stuff; very impressive! We especially appreciated the ability to bring our little dog with us. He loved sniffing around the property and going on a walk along the creek that is practically on the property."
