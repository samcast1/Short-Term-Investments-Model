It's tucked back off the street behind a 4-plex, so no cars driving by your window. There's a tree line by the deck to enjoy birdwatching and your own private oasis. We really enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Luxury at budget cost! I rented this unit as I was in town for business, but I only wished I could've stayed longer. It is a great place for a staycation and I would love to go back! Just a heads up that when you navigate to the unit, GPS will take you to the driveway in between a church an another triplex. The actual unit is behind both. Not anything negative towards the owners as it's nothing they can change, but just a heads up if you're directionally challenged like myself 🤣."

We enjoyed cooking and relaxing, mostly stayed in the Lewisburg/Lynnville area but did take a day trip to the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville which is an easy 50 minute ride north. Beautifully decorated, exactly as described with comfortable bedding we absolutely recommend booking here! The deck is a bonus- I did yoga in the mornings on the deck and then we enjoyed coffee in the rocking chairs."

Stayed about a week","David and Christy's place is so perfect for a couple! Location is awesome if you're exploring middle Tennessee, south Tennessee, and northern Alabama. 52 mi to Nashville and 51 mi to Huntsville. 35-40 mins to Lynchburg. It's a perfect base for exploration and a warm cozy place to come back to at the end of a long day. Close to lots of restaurants and a Walmart that's like a mile away. We enjoyed relaxing on the deck and watching the squirrels. Is you have a chance to book this place, you can't go wrong. They also communicate excellently and quickly. It's our first time in Tennessee and nine days wasn't long enough. Looking forward to coming back and hopefully David and Christy's place will be available!"

Stayed a few nights","Natalie's ""A Place in the pines"",
is a great AirBnB for us as a couple. it's in a smaller town (Lewisbirg, TN), and was convenient for us to drive to Culleoka for a David Phelps Gospel Concert.
Their place was an attached room to their main house at the rear, but totally setup as a stand alone apartment with two entrances, (probably per code), with an open plan, it had a kitchen, eating area, and TV / couch area. The balance of the unit had a great bedroom and beautiful bathroom with shower. This unit was recently remodeled or built and is well appointed and layed out well with all things needed. (Here are a few things to add though (that would make it better for us: a fly swatter, toaster, ant spray or traps, maybe a box of tissues. Further, an adjustment of the back door keypad deadbolt lock might be in order. (It locks, but double-check it, you possibly have to pull the door a little as the deadbolt is throwing into the locking position).
We were very happy and pleased.
Good Job!!"

Coming from a dense suburb of SoCal, I wanted to live a different lifestyle, this was the place. Loving the scenery and peacefulness, it was the best way to detach from reality. Lush greens and trees, birds chirping as you wake up, beautiful sun with breeze, what more can you ask for? During a week, I formed a bond with the goats and Herman, the brown horse. I called him that I was leaving and he came to me from his shed. I will definitely be back!! Location is close to Alabama if you want to go deep south."

We're a traveling family in the Air Force and Kristin made us feel immediately at home!
You occasionally got to hear their dog Rufus saying hello down below which just added to the country charm!
We also made friends with some adorable goats and enjoyed watching the sunrise over their field and tree line from the balcony.
The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking and there are some great local areas near by!
Not far from Nashville or Lewisburg without the big city buzz!

The goats, cats, doggos, horses, and all the animals were the cutest and most incredible. Before settling in, please read the binder with all the animal info since there are some important details about the farm animals that we guests need to know about.
The house had everything we needed, was sparkling clean, cozy, and warm. For people who love to cook (like myself), the kitchen is super well-equipped, from baking pans to pizza baking trays, all kinds and sizes of pans, utensils, it was a dream! Kristen and Bill were so wonderful, kind, flexible, and quick to respond to any questions we had.

A tornado ripped through the county and there’s no storm shelter anywhere near. The tiny home is about like being in a camper and would be extremely unsafe in severe weather. The closest (24 hour) structurally sound building is several miles away. When I asked to change dates last minute bc of the severe weather forecast, I was told no bc of it being last minute but that I could cancel and receive 1/2 of our full amount back. We still lost out on that last day but at least we were safe and sound!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall this place was pretty good.
I stayed for 2 nights for around $450. Overall, an ok deal; granted I did stay over spring break so I’m assuming prices were possibly inflated. However, while an adorable little house with a beautiful view, you will be 15 minutes away from the nearest town.
Im assuming they do not use a cleaning crew, due to the remote nature of the house. They also expect you to clean all dishes before leaving which is fine.
This leads to the first minor problem: none of the dishes were clean. I had to rewash everything by hand. Also, some parts of the counter and floors had crumbs/etc on them, as well as the bathmat.
Also, if you are allergic to pet hair, probably best to choose somewhere else; my allergies were horrendous here. Not faulting them though as they do disclose pets are allowed and I never saw any pet hair from previous tenants.
Knives are cheap; couldn’t cut cilantro.
Negatives aside, place is gorgeous, quiet, and perfect for a romantic getaway

Jan (I believe he pronounced his name ""yahn"") as a host couldn't have been easier to deal with. He never intruded, but I did flag him down when he was working on his property. The conversation ended with him offering the golf cart he was in for us to see the surrounding area. We will definitely book this home again when we return to the area."

Stayed with kids","My wife, child and I ultimately enjoyed our time at the Alexander but were somewhat disappointed with the overall experience. We had every intention of utilizing the outdoor space most of the time there. That was cut short when I got stung by wasp 30 minutes in. After some pain, investigation, and a bottle of wasp killer I had discovered several nests. By the end, there were at least 7 nests either on the roof, patio furniture or house. I texted Jan letting him know I had used the entire bottle of wasp killer. He arrived shortly after with two more bottles. He informed me that he had sprayed the house earlier that day, but stated that he needed to start knocking the nests down in the future (that didn’t happen while we there). After he left I continued to see wasps and took it upon myself to knock several nests down. By the end of our trip I had killed at least 20 wasps, 4 inside. We spent most the time inside.
The creek isn’t one you can enjoy.
Property itself is beautiful."

We woke up to deer, cows, and hummingbirds galore. Jan took every precaution from bug lamps to sprays and diffusers to ensure a comfortable stay in the outdoor space. We loved the chairs on the porch so much that we will be buying a set for home. The place is clean, organized, and cozy. The guide book was very thorough and helped us choose a great place for dinner on our first stay. Not to mention my nephew’s excitement when we told him he could sign the guest rock! Truly a gem of a stay."

The view from the deck is stunning, the guest cabin is far enough away from the main house that it feels private, but close enough that if there had been an emergency, it wouldn't have been difficult to get help. The cabin was cozy, the perfect size for two adults and our dog. I can't say anything about nearby hiking, shopping, eating, etc. as my mom and I stayed in all weekend to read. ;) The Keurig was such a nice amenity, given that we were determined to make the weekend as simple as possible. We walked the dog along the road leading to the house, and we encountered a couple folks on motorcycles, but that was it. This place truly is out in the middle of nowhere and off the beaten path, so if you're looking for somewhere to go that feels out of the way, this is a gem. :)"

This place will be at the top of our list. The pictures don't do it justice. The views feel like you are in the Smokey Mountains and the Cottage is perfect for a nice peaceful time. I can't express how much we loved this spot. 5 stars across the board!

Stayed with kids","Jan's place is beautiful! We stayed with our two kids (7 and 12) and they loved the bunk and loft! The beds are very comfortable and the kitchen is well-stocked. Everything is very clean and the view is gorgeous.
We only had a couple issues to be aware of if you rent the place: 1) the power in the back half of the house went out a few times. The breakers are in the back bedroom, so if you run into that issue, turn them off and on again; 2) there are lots of wasps on the outside deck this time of year (spring), even though she tried to spray them before our arrival. That put a damper on our stay because we were really looking forward to cooking out on the deck, but didn't want to take our chances.
Otherwise, we loved our stay!"

Much better than a hotel for our family of 5. My only warning is that the bunk beds have thin mattresses and are really meant for smaller kids and aren’t comfortable for teens or adults. But otherwise this place is great and we’d definitely stay again."

I wanted to love the place so much, especially given the small touches that Jan included, but the only thing that I wished was better was the bug situation. I had to catch 2 stinkbugs, and found more. But I understand that it would be near difficult to completely get rid of them, since it is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nature. Overall good stay."

The house is also designed very beautifully and is very unique. It was a big enough house to allow everyone to not be on top of each other getting ready and give everyone space when needed. It also was extremely accessible, as my 84 year old grandma was with us, so the handicap ramp and accessible shower was also very nice to have as well. The home was very private and it was a beautiful drive through the countryside to get there. It is a very peaceful area and Kim was a great host as well. 100% would recommend to anyone!!"

The area is absolutely beautiful, the farm in the background is a postcard setting. With horses in the pasture , chickens (producing some delicious fresh eggs) to the other animals providing a truly memorable experience.
The screened in porch give the perfect opportunity to enjoy your morning coffee or evening cocktail. Before you retire to the most comfortable beds adorned with high quality cozy bedding.
Do your self a favor, and add this home to your itinerary, I promise you will not be disappointed."

We enjoyed the hot tub and the creek as well. A great get away to reset and relax. It rained while we were there and my wife highly enjoyed watching the ran with the “sunroof” in the yurt.
We called the kids while we were here and the kids were begging us to bring them to the Yurt. Still deciding if we want to bring them - or keep this place all to ourselves. But we already have plans to return!"

Everything is easily accessible. It is very quiet area and we felt really secluded. You cannot tell that you’re staying on someone’s property. Keith was accommodating, helpful, and really friendly! We walked around the creek line and also hung out in the shade. There is a spot in the woods with chairs in case you need to cool off. We had everything we needed…heat and ac work and we did use both. The hot tub was very clean and easy to access. I look forward to staying here again and will recommend to friends & family. We plan on visiting again. Thanks Keith and Misty!"

We had the best of both worlds, a day trip to Nashville (about 1 hour) and a day trip to hike the waterfalls (about 1 hour). Grocery/gas was only 5-10 minutes in case we needed something quick.
I recommend this everyone looking for something different for an affordable price.

Cornersville is a peaceful small rural town with two goats, some chickens and a rooster next door to the Carriage House. Took a walk and neighbors were friendly. Only restaurant we found was the Tennessee Truck and Travel Stop (huge and incudes donut shop). It was very nice and breakfast was the only meal we needed to get.
The Carriage House has a wonderful rainforest shower in a spacious bathroom and a comfortable queen bed. Roku TV in living room works well. Kitchen has full-size appliances but only a few dishes. We didn’t cook there so it wasn’t an issue for us.
Enjoyed our stay."

There's not a lot to do as far as shopping and restaurants. But if you are looking for small town with quiet and peaceful surroundings, this is it. We used it as an opportunity to enjoy driving through the countryside and visiting other small towns in the area.
It is just as described, and the hosts are very responsive. Be sure and say hi to the two goats and chickens that live in the pen next door and marvel at their very posh accommodations as well."

The hot water lasts for about 5 minutes, then you’ll get a lukewarm warning for about a minute before it goes full on freezing so be aware of that.
Other than those things it truly was a relaxing, peaceful stay. The goats right next door were so cute, and the whole ambience made me feel like I was much further away from “society” than I actually was."

We decided to get away for a few days for our anniversary this year, but stay local. Sharon knew it was our anniversary and had a card and a box of chocolates waiting there for us upon arrival.
Everything was clean and tidy. We felt like we were stepping into a fancy hotel room on the beach. 10 out of 5 stars!!"

Everything you could need was made available, even lists of places to eat and things to do. Our favorite part had to be greeting the animals outside after every visit to and from the house!

First of all the drive in is GORGEOUS! Lewisburg looks to be a very equestrian are so the whole way there you're really seeing some of the most beautiful homes and horses; its just a dream if yiu love horses.
The apartment itself was so beautiful 😍 and something super fun is the windows that look into the horse barn from inside the apartment. The fact that everything runs on well water was so amazing. My hair and skin were SO GRATEFUL for how soft the water was in the shower. As well as I'm just a country girl who appreciates well water.
Mr. Gina and her Husband were just very pleasant and acomidating people and my stay was so comfortable and relaxing its definitely on the top of my list for places I wouod love to return to just for the fun of staying there. 😊"

Stayed with a pet","Gina and her husband were very easy to get ahold of and very pleasant to speak with. The unit is as described and pictured, clean, and has all the necessities. I had incorrectly assumed that there was a bunch of units just based on the size of the front of the barn, but the rest of the barn is just that- a barn- so I saw no one other than the hosts (and only saw them in passing) so it was a very peaceful stay. There is a Dollar General maybe a mile from the property, and a gas station a bit beyond that, so there are the basics close by, and everything else is an easy 8 minute drive away. If you are in search of an easy, safe, and friendly spot, this will perfectly suit your needs. Thank you Gina and Randall!"

Stayed with a pet","The property is amazing and there is plenty to do and see. There is a Dollar General super close and Kroger about 10 mins away. Franklin is under an hour away 100% worth a visit to the downtown square and cute shops. It is obvious that Gordon has a great eye for decor and the home feels fancy but also welcoming. The 2 cats are fun to have around as are the chickens! If you have access to the small cabin outside, it's adorable! The basketball, bikes, board games, and nature are great fun!
Things that you may want to know: There is only one TV in the home and no DVD player. Wifi is available, but not great and phone service (T-Mobile) is spotty. However, nature is always on - we saw turkeys and deer on the property; that was pretty exciting. Most of the cooking supplies are available, but not all that you may expect if you're used to staying in AirBnb's. There is a lady bug encroachment issue around the kitchen and living rooms. The bathroom doors are a little tricky to keep closed."

I was looking forward to the chickens and fresh eggs but none were on the property as advertised. The house is beautiful! Tons of games are provided, we enjoyed the swing on the property as well. I noticed a few small ant like insects on the sheets in the small bedroom next to the master suite . Other than that this place is perfect. Gordon has thought of everything! there are tons of amenities available. this property is beautiful and my family is already discussing returning soon."

Stayed with kids","This was perfect for our lowkey Bachelorette weekend. Gordon was very helpful and proactive with his communications. His directions definitely helped me find the place when my GPS was lacking. A few girls were disappointed that the hot tub was not functioning during our stay, but it felt like we were somewhere secluded in the mountains despite being so close to town.
One of the beds was much firmer than I am used to, so my son was not a fan of sleeping there. The girls were huge fans of collecting fresh eggs from the chickens.
Overall, we genuinely enjoyed our stay and had plenty of space and lots to do. We would definitely recommend it to others."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at Gordon's amazing property. It is definitely secluded so be sure and follow Gordon's instructions. GPS will not get you there...
The place was spotless and we were very comfortable. The bed in the master was very comfortable but there are no curtains so be ready to wake up when the sun rises. :-)
There is very limited internet (as described in other reviews) so do not plan on watching television. However, we knew that going in and had a lovely weekend with friends and family exploring the property, cooking and playing games. The cats were also a huge hit with the kids.
Gordon was amazingly responsive. Upon arrival, there was a strange smell that had us slightly worried. I reached out to Gordon and he explained that the HVAC is propane and the smell appeared when the unit was turned on after not being in use for a while. He told us it would dissipate soon and he was correct. We had no issues at all after that.
All in all, it was a very great stay!"

We had our two dogs with us and they loved exploring the grounds. We also saw so many deer. This was exactly what we were looking for. The only disappointment was the hot tub was not going. I know it says seasonal on the listing, I find spring and fall the best season for hot tubs. But overall that was minor! The kitchen was easy to cook in, and had sharp knives (which is rare in Airbnb). The bedrooms are spacious."

The space was clean, there was a variety of things to do around the house, and the host (Gordon) is extremely responsive. We had 3 separate cars come and no one had any trouble finding the place or getting up the driveway — which was on the steep side, but again, no issues.
As my group was staying there, I heard a couple comment that they’d love to return and take Gordon up on his offer of a cooking class."

Stayed with a pet","Gordon's beautiful home and property is a special place. It sits atop a hill and allows you to appreciate the stunning scenery while also lending full privacy. There is so much to see and explore on his land from the chickens to the koi pond to the greenhouse that you may not even feel the need to explore elsewhere. There's so many other spaces too - an outdoor kitchen and pergola, a swing and fire pit and a big red barn that has a small walking trail behind it. Despite the bitter cold, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves exploring all Gordon's property has to offer. And for those that want to get away but don't necessarily want to spend all day outside, there are numerous indoor games as well as table tennis. The kitchen is fully equipped for those that enjoy cooking and there is both a tea kettle and a coffee maker for a morning boost. We utilized two bedrooms in the home and the beds were quite comfortable and the sheets were of nice quality. I appreciate that there were plenty of toiletries left at the house as well (tp, soap, linens, etc). In addition to the home and property being lovely, the host, Gordon, was equally so. He was quick to respond and provided detailed driving instructions prior to our trip. He even made sure our 5 year old daughter ""found"" an egg in the chicken coop. It's this kindness and attention to detail that separates good hosts from incredible ones. If you're considering this beautiful property and home, book it. You'll be glad you did. We're already planning another trip in the spring so we can experience the property in a different season. Also, the location is great - it's 15 minutes to just about everything in the surrounding area."

Group trip","We loved our stay at Gordon's place! We are already talking about coming back when the hot-tub is running and all of the plants are blooming.
The property is beautifully landscaped and the sunrise and sunset views are amazing from the top of the hill. Despite it being a very cold January weekend, we enjoyed sitting in the greenhouse during the day to play games. There are also a ton of stars visible on nights with few clouds.
The house itself is very well outfitted and the kitchen really does have everything you may need for cooking. The dining room table is big enough to squeeze in 10 people for meals and games.
Things I'd suggest to people looking at booking this house:
-Try to have at least one vehicle coming that has AWD. Front wheel drive cars will not make it up to the house, and carrying all your stuff up the hill is quite a cardio workout.
-If you want to hook a game system up to the TV, bring your own extension cord because there is not an accessible outlet near the TV.
-There are not many lights outside and it is very dark at night, so I'd suggest bringing headlamps or flashlights with you if you want to go outside at night.
-If you want to sleep in, bring an eye mask to block out the light because the bedrooms get very bright in the mornings."

Group trip","As city folks coming to a country hilltop estate, it was a huge difference, but we had a great time! Gordon was very responsive and he had an amazing property.
Please please please, read and take snapshot of the details of how to get to the location. We arrived at night, which was not recommended because of the dark roads, but because of work and where we were coming from, that was the only time possible that we could make it. Your GPS will likely take you to the wrong spot, and we were trying to get into Gordon's neighbor's house (oops), until we called him.
Also, the service and wifi is a little iffy, so this is an amazing place for a getaway with your family. Being from Chicago, I rarely ever see chickens, so it was an amazing site when we woke up in the morning to see the chickens and even get a chance to get some fresh eggs.
Also, during the day, the property is beautiful! You must go out and explore! There's a small pond, bikes to explore the property and a cute greenhouse! The reason why I say during the day is just because it's super dark at night, so you can't see as much. That may be one of my only suggestions, if there could be a few more lights so that maybe people want to hang out on the property at night (i.e. hot tub, balcony/decks, pond, outdoor kitchen).
In addition, Gordon was very very responsive throughout both the day and night (even when I called him late at night because we were loss trying to get to the property).
Lastly, this location is a little further out from restaurants, etc. so just something to keep in mind. We visited for a baby shower in Spring Hill, which was about 40 minutes away. But there is a nice Mexican restaurant about 15 minutes away.
Would stay again, if I need another family get away."

The host (Gordon) was awesome and his communication prior to and throughout the stay to ensure that we had everything we needed was much appreciated! Hank (the dog) and his crew ensure the place stays safe and sound each day and were an absolute pleasure to hang out with during our stay. You will definitely want to drive an AWD or 4x4 vehicle…the driveway was the only (minor) obstacle and thus the reason for the 4/5 star rating for the location. Everything else was 5/5. We will definitely be back anytime we return to the area. Thanks for an awesome stay and experience!

Stayed over a week","Gordon and his beautiful estate served my coworkers and I superbly. After long, long days of hard work we were able to decompress on the beautiful drive home. When we first arrived, Gordon warned us that the driveway was hard to find. He was right! He stayed patient with us and helped us find the proper driveway. I really appreciate and commend his kindness and love for cooking. He made us a delicious meal one night, and we all shared stories together! There are animals on this property and one of them is a White Great Pyrenees named Hank. Hank is the best and most interesting dog I have ever had the pleasure of meeting!
Thank you so much, Gordon and Hank for making our stay so unique and unforgettable. The two weeks I stayed in Tennessee were some of the most stressful weeks of my life due to work, but when I arrived back ""home"" to Gordon's estate and was greeted by Hank, the cats, and the chickens I just could not stay stressed any longer. I hope someone else can have as great of an experience here as I had with my team!"

Stayed a few nights","Our week at this Tennessee farmhouse was lovely! The rustic charm and peaceful surroundings made for a delightful stay. The host was responsive and replied very timely.
A couple things to note; the amenities were sufficient for a quicks stay. For those staying longer, keep in mind that Hygiene products such as shampoo and conditioner are not supplied, the toilet paper is single ply, and the knifes in the kitchen are very dull. It might be worth stopping at the store on your way in.
Another consideration for out-of-state guests like us, is we were caught off guard when we were issued a tornado warning. We were unsure of where to take shelter since there was no basement, interior room, or other shelter. It would be nice if the host provided a pre-planned suggestion.
Despite this, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would consider returning. Overall, a wonderful retreat in Tennessee's countryside!"

That stove also heats the house, but it is all taken care of and regulated by a thermostat in the house. It is such a cool setup! The water pressure is FANTASTIC!
The property is 5 minutes from town, but you are on a farm in the country. We LOVED seeing the cows out the window.

Stayed with kids","Our getaway at the Bluff Springs Farmhouse was very pleasant! The farm suroundings were very serene, very quiet; it was a true getaway. Both bedrooms and beds were comfortable and spacious. We went mid-November and the Christmas tree was up already so it added a festive touch. Appreciated how sunny it was inside the house: many places to sit and enjoy the warm rays. The home is truly cozy. My husband and his brother were able to enjoy the walk to the nearby lake. The stars at nighttime are beautiful: It's nice to really see the stars away from the city lights. There wasn't hand soap in the bathroom when we arrived but Jade's dad came by to drop it off rather quickly.
Communication w/Jade was easy and always prompt. We appreciated her providing a pack n play for my baby. The local donuts on the first day were a nice treat. We also appreciated her flexibility for check-in and check-out. We also appreciated her picking up the recycling!"

Stayed a few nights","Jade's place was quiet quaint and cozy. It's was close to hiking and although off the beaten path and a large cattle property - it was minutes from conveniences like Walmart and Alex's Tacos. As a heads up, get there during the day, because it's pitch black at night, hard to find the drive to turn on to the property, and there is an edge on the left with barb wire where the car could go off. We didn't find it dangerous, just hard to navigate the first time in the dark. Parking was easy and there was room if we had a second car. Jade and her dad was available right away for small repairs. We would definitely stay their again."

Stayed a few nights","For Spring Break, we usually head to a beach location, or we travel up north to visit family. This year, we wanted something different. We have visited the Nashville, Franklin and Columbia areas in the past, and enjoy that area. We wanted an option to hotels this time, and discovered the Farmhouse thru AirBnB.
We had a wonderful stay for the week. A very unique choice. The house great, and you could feel the history. Spacious bedrooms and living room. The kitchen had a reading area in the corner, with windows looking out onto the cattle fields. The old-time front porch, a back deck, and a large enclosed side porch - many spots to relax!
The farm is about 100 acres. Fun to watch the cattle moving around during the day - and the young calves running and playing. Nice sunrises over the field.
We explored some of the local small towns, and did a lot of thrifting.
We all had a fun week. The hosts were great. No issues during the stay. This was a very enjoyable vacation. We will come back!"

The coffee maker and toaster oven made it reasonably easy to get a meal together! TV had all the options you need to binge watch movies and shows whilst on holidays! The barn is out in the country so having a car is important! Overall a comfortable and peaceful few days!"

The bathroom was stocked with everything you might need plus special things that often aren’t thought about. The accommodations were separate from the main house so was very private and even had a fire pit with a beautiful view. I highly recommend this space to enjoy so farmland and small homestead living."

Glad to know there are local options in emergency situations and not just while traveling for vacation."

Randy was responsive when we couldn’t get the gate code to work upon our return from dinner one night.

It's far enough off the beaten path, but yet so close to everything you need (Walmart and restaurants are just a mile or two away) You won't regret staying here! Randy is so sweet and friendly. He is very welcoming and makes you feel right at home. If there's anything you need or if you have any questions, he's so quick to respond. Also, if your not from the area, there is a place my friends and I found that's about 20-30 minutes away where you can go tubing down a river. It's less than $10 a person for the day. It was at Henry Horton state park. They also have kayaks and canoes."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect place to get away from the stress of everyday life. We were within 45 min drive to Nashville and 3 minutes from Lewisburg. Nestled on a horse farm, isolated in a beautiful, cozy cabin. We could walk the property and visit the boarded horses and Beany the 'mayor' miniature donkey that runs the place. Randy his son were very welcoming and left us to ourselves but a text away. Everything we needed was in the cabin, including coffee for those that need it. We found an amazing place to go horseback riding within 33 miles of this place, Natchez Trace Stables that were fantastic. We wanted a ride that would allow some trots and gallops and got a 2 hr ride, they will arrange whatever you need. That made the trip perfect. The plan here is to eventually have riders come and have that opportunity for those interested here, and we will be back the minute they get that part set up. This is a perfect place to come and I hope it will always be this affordable, you get so much for such a fair price. I'm sure this place will be booked all the time, so sign up when you can."

That says so much when Mom and a teenage daughter agree! Lots of quality time spent together in this amazing cabin nestled in the rolling hills of Tennessee!

Stayed one night","Wow! I have never had a more peaceful night with my hubby to relax. We sit on the couch for hours talking, and laughing. After 12 valentines days, we never not want to celebrate us— and The Carriage House gave us a quick getaway. We live only 59 miles away — but still wanted to feel as if we took a “trip”… the fireplace was so calming, I want to replace my entire bathroom now thanks to this amazing one at Sharon’s!
Pulaski made for a great day tripping and exploring experience— nearby.
It was perfect!

Walking in the door - it smelled AMAZING - and was so clean. They went above and beyond providing snacks & a few drinks in the fridge.
I could have stayed in the shower for hours & the bed was SO cozy.

This is one of those great secrets you don’t want to get out but honestly, this was a perfect rental for my wife and I for a four day trip to TN. The hosts are amazing in communicating and provided the Southern Hospitality we all have heard of. The location is excellent, the house is well kept and maintained and is definitely a cottage home. The amenities the house has to offer makes you feel like you are at your own home.
We appreciate the hosts opening up this home and allowing our first visit to TN to be a great experience as my wife and I were looking forward to arriving every evening after the days of visiting other attractions. This has definitely set a standard that all of our other rentals in the future will probably not measure up to."

Finally, you could not ask for a better host family. We felt like family by the time we departed. Sharon is very kind and engaging as is Nathan. Their kids are very kind,polite and busy helping with the animals. Having the goats,chickens cats and a dog just made even more fun. This is a fun happy place. Definitely recommend staying here.👍👍"

It is so cute, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. Bed was great, HUGE shower, fluffy towels, easy check-in, and the glass rock fireplace was on when we arrived. It's just off the interstate, so a perfect stop on our way between Louisiana and northern Indiana. The only thing to be aware of if you're not bringing your own food, is that there aren't any restaurants close by. We were trying to outrun a storm, so we stopped for take-out on the way - which worked out great. It looks exactly like the pictures and there are even a pair of goats in the yard to admire!"

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed here for just one night in March 2022--we were looking for a place approximately halfway between central IL and Gulf Shores that wasn't too far off the interstate. We found everything to be great--the place was super clean and, most importantly, we were greeted by two goats and a cat after parking our car:-) We picked up food in Lewisburg on our way in. Fireplace is nice, an insane amount of TV channels, bathroom was huge with shampoo, etc., provided. Cute little place."

Stayed a few nights","The carriage house was a great place for my husband and I to retreat to! It was clean and comfortable. Sharon was quick with her responses and even made it a point to check in on us during our stay. This home is located in cornersville, which is super quaint and quite but is close to major TN towns & amenities!"

Stayed one night","Great little quiet spot to spend the night...bathroom is very nicely done...comfy couch to watch TV from....and, you are parked right at the front door. Easy check-in and check-out. If we are in the area again and need a place to stay we are hopeful Sharon has her carriage house available."

Stayed a few nights","Quaint, clean and charming stay in the carriage house. First night we enjoyed some Lawlers BBQ and stayed in. The next full day we spent at Henry Horton State Park, hiking and golfing. The hike was along the Duck River and very scenic meeting fishermen and other hikers along the way to the “Wetlands area”. The golf course was a great deal and the greens were some of the nicest we’ve played anywhere at any price!"

Stayed a few nights","Sharon’s place is absolutely adorable! She and her husband Nathan have seen to all the details that matter, like a comfortable bed, cozy living area and stunning bathroom. Everything was clean and inviting!
Sharon is a great host! She communicated well and even suggested a restaurant she thought we would enjoy!
The neighborhood is quiet and we got a kick out of seeing their 2 goats out in the yard."

Stayed one night","The Carriage House is stunningly beautiful! From the peaceful, serene atmosphere to the most amazing shower, to the tiniest details, we loved our stay so much! We are truly in love with the pet goats (Phineas and Ferb)! I love them! We enjoyed cooking a meal together and celebrating our anniversary as Mrs. Sharon decorated the entire place with lovely romantic touches! You will absolutely love the charm of this town, The Carriage House, and the most graceful hosts! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights",I loved this Airbnb so much! I’m a travel nurse and I felt like it was my home away from home. They were very accommodating and worked with my weird schedule of working nights. They even cleared my car off when it snowed. I would definitely recommend this air bnb to anyone (:

Stayed a few nights","We wanted a location “away from life” but also convenient and not too far away. We found this place a few days before we confirmed we were able to go. Location and amenities were perfect for us. An hour from Franklin and close to Walmart and groceries as needed, but far enough away traffic and loud noises weren’t an issue. A comfy small kitchen and an awesome spa shower helped us to relax on vacation and take care of ourselves. Highly recommend this charming place to stay."

Sharon was communicative, and understanding when I showed up a little early. Also, that shower is the highlight of the space. I could live there..."

Stayed one night","Cute location. Modern living. The bed is very comfortable and the shower is heavenly. The even bigger surprise was the two cute little goats we got to see during our stay, as well as the outdoor kitties. Cute country feel while still being modern and luxurious! Would definitely recommend."
