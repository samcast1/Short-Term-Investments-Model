Stayed a few nights","So convenient, so chic, just perfect! We loved our weekend stay at Gerda’s place. There are plenty of coffee shops and cafes nearby, and the ferry is within walking distance. The only thing to consider is that the apartment is above several places that open early in the morning, and while peaceful and quiet at night, you may find it hard to sleep in!"

The stairs up to the apartment were narrow in places, but it felt very European. Gerda was very responsive to any inquiries we had and provided a lot of information about local eateries and activities. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This place in Vineyard Haven was a perfect place to stay while my husband and I visited Martha’s Vineyard. It’s much quieter than hub towns like Oak Bluffs. We are a night owls, but chill ones, and V.H. goes to sleep by 10pm so we had fun walking down to the water and checking out the boats and the nights sky. once we got scared off by skunks (WATCH OUT FOR SKUNKS!) … we went back to Gerda’s and enjoyed sitting in the window and looking at the street below. Gerda was attentive and made us feel confident in our decision to stay at her charming/cozy spot. it was shockingly spacious. I felt like we lived there for 48 hours! Her recommendations were great too. We brought our bikes over on the ferry (no car) and had a blast riding them all over the place and using the bus system to get around (super easy). 10s across the board for this special spot. Would absolutely book again! Thanks Gerda!"

Perfectly located in the center of downtown Vineyard Haven above a small boutique, you were surrounded by small cafes, a diverse selection of classy restaurants, and winsome beaches nearby. The Airbnb itself was impeccably clean with a lovely decor and super comfortable bed. Gerda made herself available for anything we might have needed. It was an easy-in, easy-out procedure settling into the Airbnb and leaving afterwards. I can’t recommend enough this romantic and charming little lodging for anyone visiting Martha’s Vineyard."

The location in Vineyard Haven was central, easily walkable to everything in town. There is some morning noise from the street and the ferry boat horns, but that comes with the great location! We didn't really mind. We walked to Beach Road for dinner one night and it was excellent. A wonderful spot in the heart of town. We definitely recommend Gerda's place!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a gorgeous apartment in the heart of Vineyard Haven. It’s not inexpensive to stay on MV, so when you book the vacation you hope to arrive at just this type of retreat. Not only is it beautiful, but it’s quiet, very comfortable, and furnished with everything you need to make you feel at home. No expense is spared- the nespresso maker and high end toiletries are a nice touch.
Gerda is an excellent hostess. Communication was easy and she was quick to respond to questions. She sent along a great list of restaurant recommendations. I’d definitely stay again!!"

Gerda was extremely thoughtful in every aspect... from suggestions about bringing our car over on the ferry, where to park, suggestions for where to drive on the island, where to eat (great suggestions by the way!), etc. etc.
Her apartment has amazing light, was extremely well cleaned and very thoughtfully put together. From coffee pods, to lovely thick towels, to a picnic basket for our snacks when going to the beach, etc. The apartment had a lovely flow to it with spacious proportions.
The location in Main Street is perfect as it’s right next to many great restaurants and coffee shops.
We can’t wait to come back!"

The apartment is beautiful and stylish. It had everything we needed. She even had fresh flowers for us. It's very centrally located, right off the ferry and right in the middle of town, just steps away from all the stores and restaurants. We loved our stay at MV and can't wait to come back again soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow, what a delightful find! No wonder it's always booked up. As a person who knows Martha's Vineyard fairly well, I don't think I would stay anywhere else than here. Staying in Vineyard Haven is a great choice because it's a stone's throw from the ferry and within walking distance to excellent cafes, coffee shops, book shops, and art galleries. When the name of the game is parking, you definitely want a solid home base that has plenty around it within waking distance.
I loved this location because Gerda was extremely attentive (and so interesting!) and I loved her style- very sharp white and black checks with sparkling clean white bathrooms and lovely white bedclothes. Additionally, her little kitchenette was the perfect size for cooking a little something on her tiny ceramic stovetop or microwave oven, but more importantly, perfect for reheating your leftovers from your delicious Vineyard restaurants :). I couldn't believe I found such a place and will definitely be coming back with my significant other.
We were able to ride all around to the best places, so definitely centrally located. 25 minutes from Menemsha fish market for lobster rolls, 5 minutes from downtown Oak Bluffs (carousel, campground, and Offshore Ale Co.), 15 minutes from Edgartown for a lovely dinner at the Harbor View. She encouraged us to spend more time ""Up-island"" (Chilmark, West Tisbury, Aquinnah) to check out the Sherriff's Meadows conservation lands, and we sure will!"

Firstly, I'd like to say that Gerda is the most welcoming and thorough host I've encountered! She is incredibly warm and responsive. She provides all the information you need to have a smooth transition to the island and a relaxing stay while there. With regards to the apartment, it is in a word, gorgeous! The furnishings are clean and comfy, the linens and sheets are soft. The place has everything you need and many things you don't but will delight in having!! We will do our best to stay there again!

It was so convenient to have a place in town where lots of shops are in short walking distance. In-town place comes with some street noise, but it was transient and didn't become an issue. The place is on the 2nd floor. We felt safe and secure. We are so happy we chose this place for our MV trip! You will too."

The house was clean and very organized, and as the host Adrian is an artist, he has created several of the beautiful art pieces found throughout the house as well as outside.
Our room was comfortable. We had everything we could have wanted such as towels, a hairdryer, and extra toilet paper in our private half bathroom. There is a shared upstairs full bathroom as well as an outdoor shower that we also had access to. We were able to borrow their bicycles, helmets, and locks which was an added bonus to explore the area.
Adrian and his wife Sweta live upstairs and are welcoming and lovely people. They helped make our experience at Martha's Vineyard a pleasant and memorable one. Would definitely stay at their home again and recommend to others."

The proximity to town was perfect: just a few, walkable minutes from the center of town and the ferry landing. Their historic house is charming and homey; you really feel like you are staying with family. Adrian was quick to respond to questions and offered great recommendations on beaches and restaurants and loaned us bikes and beach towels and just about anything we needed. Cannot recommend this accommodation highly enough."

Stayed a few nights","It was a very nice place, clean and tidy. Adrian and/or his partner, Sweta, were always around to answer questions and make suggestions. They were both very kind and full of great and interesting information. There are two outside showers, which I enjoyed using. They also had bicycles available for use, which I never got around to using (maybe next time), but I did check them out and they were in good condition. There was a hair dryer available and a private toilet room attached to our room (downstairs), which was a big bonus. If you prefer to use the inside shower you have to go upstairs, which was perfectly acceptable, but I’ll almost always recommend an outside shower when available :). The house is located within walking distance of the ferry, restaurants, and shopping (probably a bus too, but I had a car this time). Street parking was easy in front of their home. Overall, it was a great stay! Thank you both so much."

We were able to get massages at the Mansion House nearby, breakfast at Black Dog, and snacks at the Stop & Shop - all within 5 minutes of the house. We could not have asked for a better place or host."

only locally in Vineyard Haven, but to other places throughout Martha's Vineyard. Hoping to have future return trips.

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Mark’s place. It was super convenient to the ferry, with a grocery store and some restaurants nearby. There’s also a place to rent bikes on the corner.
The apartment itself was great - it looked exactly like the pictures and was a great size for two guests. I would’ve happily spent more time in the apartment if the we’d had bad weather. We both really liked the shower. It’s kind of a high pressure mist. The beds were also very comfortable.
Mark was a great host who was very easy to communicate and was very sweet. He happily accommodated our last minute parking needs. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone, as long as stairs aren’t an issue."

Booking was easy and Mark was kind answering all my questions and very helpful advising on the best way to get to Martha's Vineyard. I followed his recommandations on bus, ferry and car rental and everything went smoothly. The apartment is very cute, well maintained and wonderfully equipped to have a great stay (including AC). The location is amazing because everything is walking distance (shop, beach, restaurants, car rentals, ferry). Parking is also easy. Mark lives downstairs so we got to meet each other and it was reassuring knowing there is someone local to count on if needed. I had to checkout earlier than initially scheduled and Mark made it very easy. I definitely recommend Mark's apartment!"

Less than a block away from the iconic Black Dog and a grocery store and bike rental, you don't even have to have a car. Clean and comfortable, the flat has everything you need for a small family, couple or single traveler. There's even the famous Chicken Alley thrift store-market across the street if you've forgotten anything or you're just looking for a bargain! Mark is friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The flat has a nautical theme and a ship's clock that chimes quietly on the half hour, which we found charming, and so many books about the nautical and natural history of the region we could have stayed for a month just to read them all! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks Mark!"

It had everything that I needed and then some. The decor was certainly New England, and I loved the vibe! From the furniture pieces to the beamed ceilings and high windows, who could ask for anything more?
Mark’s extended library has a mastery of information about the island, past and present. Everything you will need is in walking distance. I especially liked sleeping with the windows open. The sleep was very deep and the cool night breeze from the ocean has a HEALING effect. I can go on and on. I did rent a car to go to Edgartown and Oaks Bluff. Mark was a great host and his attitude matched that of all the people that I met on the island; hospitable and extremely helpful. I am a customer service manager and have trained people in customer service, so believe me, I KNOW customer service. Mark gets an A+++. How I would love to live there on the island!"

The apartment was well decorated with a nautical theme, and included some of Mark's professional photographs, and a wonderful library as well.

We stayed here for our wedding weekend and had a lot of people coming and going helping us prepare, which wasn’t ideal for Mark as we were constantly running up and down the stairs (which are super steep btw!) lugging supplies back and forth leading up to the event, but otherwise would have been an ideal location for us."

Stayed with kids","We had a comfortable stay at the place. The place is as advertised and Mark has been a helpful host.
The place is maintained spotless clean which was reassuring during these times.
We didn't report a broken shower until the third day after we started our visit (would have been great had it been checked before we checked in) however the host promptly had the plumber come in to fix it. Given it is COVID-19 times, we would have liked some pre planning in terms of how to let a new person enter into the apartment, however we were asked to leave the apartment for the plumber within 15 minutes. It was a bit sudden and not convenient with a toddler in tow, especially when we were in the middle of lunch. Would have liked this to have been handled a bit better considering the child and the price we were paying for the room.
Other than this inconvenience, we had a good stay overall."

Also the library in the apartment is extensive, I recommend the history on Martha’s Vineyard book located on the bookshelf attached the stairs.

Stayed a few nights","This is a bright, comfortable, quaint little apartment in a great location. It was very clean, which I appreciated because I am a stickler for those things. You get the whole space to yourself; the apartment has its own separate entrance. It is a good size for a small family. It has a full bed and a queen air mattress, and the bedroom and living room are both large enough to accommodate the air mattress (so you can see the kids when they sleep, or not, as you see fit). You get your own kitchen and of course, bath. The location is about a block from the shopping in Tisbury, so the location is awesome. Mark was very nice, available to answer questions, but gave us our space.

Some things that are good to know: The apartment is a second-floor walk-up. The neighborhood is fine, but is a mix of residences and warehouses, so don't be surprised. And bring a computer if you want to watch tv. The apartment has wifi and a tv screen, but not cable tv.

This was a really neat little place and we would definitely stay here again."

The place was exactly how we had expected and hoped...clean, comfortable, A/C in bedroom and living room, close to town, parking for our car, etc. I would be more than glad to stay there again and would recommend this apartment to family and friends!"

Stayed a few nights","My family had a great stay. The apartment was very clean and spacious enough for 4 people. I loved the special touches to welcome us - fresh flowers, local newspapers and a great collection of books about the island. The days were hot during our stay and even though air conditioners were available, we did not need them. The breeze from the windows and ceiling fans were wonderful. We did not bring a car so the location was perfect - short walk to town, the ferry and the bus stop. All instructions from our host were clear and concise. Perfect experience!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a quaint cottage with nice indoor and outdoor space. If you have back issues, I would not recommend the Murphy Bed; with no back issues I think the bed is adequate. Just a few recommendations: it would be great to have bath towels for two people. There were some beach towels to use; but they were not freshly laundered and we needed to launder them before use. Secondly, a decent pan set would make the stay more enjoyable to be able to cook. Finally, locking the unit is very temperamental and I had to web search for alternative methods after contacting the on call person for assistance. He was very nice but could not resolve what I see from other reviews is an issue with the automatic lock. Overall l, I would recommend even if these suggestions are not implemented."

Thank you Eric & Joss for providing a dream vacation home. From the time we booked, they were communicative, and were so accommodating.
We needed little things such as a place for the babies to sleep, and they provided Pack n Plays. We needed an early check in because of naps, and they said no problem.
The house itself was beautiful, spacious, well decorated and you felt right at home as soon as you stepped in.
After 5+ stars for hosts, and house, then you have the bonus of location! Location! Location! You can easily walk downtown Tisbury to restaurants & shops.
We will be back and staying here again (if available 🙃)!"

Group trip","We were 3 couples, traveling to Martha’s Vineyard for the first time. Weeks before the trip Eric and Joss quickly answered the many questions we had. We continued to ask and get quick responses up until our arrival.
The house is at the end of a dirt road right near town, we were able to walk with all our luggage from the Vineyard Haven ferry. We opened the door to a spotless, beautifully appointed home with plenty of room for 3 couples. Bathrooms were beautiful, kitchen had everything we needed, living room perfectly accommodated our JAWS movie night.
I highly recommend this house , we had a wonderful time ."

The location is absolutely unbeatable; it's situated in the heart of Vinyard Heaven, walkable from the ferry and all stores and restaurants but still in a peaceful neighborhood.
The house itself was nothing short of amazing. It's incredibly spacious, allowing four couples to enjoy their privacy while also providing ample common areas for us to come together. The attention to detail in the interior design and furnishings truly made this place feel like a luxurious retreat."

All of the bathrooms are a wonderful size and the walk in showers in the bathrooms were so awesome loved the decor. The kitchen had all of the amenities we could want and needed. The house is truly the best kept secret on the island. We were close to everything on the island. The bed room furniture decor and size of all of the room was perfect. Mattresses were very comfortable. The central air in home was a bonus for us as well. I would highly recommend this house and look forward to returning to make more family memories. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Stayed with kids","My family and I had a wonderful stay at Eric's and Joss’ home. It was everyone’s first time visiting Martha’s Vineyard and the only disappointment was not being able to stay longer! Their home was beautiful and spacious enough for 7 adults, and 1 child. The location was, as advertised, in close proximity to Main Street where there are cute shops & restaurants (special mention to Waterside Cafe (sandwiches to DIE for) and the Sideline shop), and about a 15-20 minute drive from Oak Bluffs. One thing to note which we did not realize is Tisbury is a dry town. You have to drive to Oak Bluffs to purchase any alcohol unless at a restaurant (food must be ordered). We did have an issue managing the temperature for the fridge and freezer where nothing froze in the freezer, not got ice-cold in the refrigerator. We also had issues with the wifi and living room tv for the first day or two. Eric was super reachable, and very responsive. All in all, it was an amazing stay in an amazing home."

While the apartment was in a prime location for Vineyard Haven, my only call-out is at night there's not a lot going on (as Vineyard Haven is historically a dry town). If you're looking for more things to do at night, you might want to consider staying in Oak Bluffs or Edgartown. If you're looking for something more quiet, Vineyard Haven, and more specifically Gerda's apartment, would be perfect."

The location is beyond convenient! A stone’s throw to the ferry. Roll out of bed for a morning awakening at Mocha Mott’s or a stroll along Main Street window shopping until the marvelous shops open.
Vineyard Haven classics such as Bunches of Grapes bookstore and Brickman’s general merchandise- clothing, shoes, sundries, and toys- are nearby. You won’t want to leave once you make yourself at home!
Gerda is a super host for good reason!!!!! 😎❣️😎"

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is centrally located and conveniently close to the ferry station which mattered to us since we didn’t bring a car. When we arrived we had a few issues with plumbing but Gerda did her best to resolve the issue right away. If you bring personal expensive bikes and are used to storing it indoors, just be aware you will have to simply lock your bikes outside to bannisters near the sidewalk. Beach chairs and umbrella are provided but the beach where you can actually sit and lounge is about 12 minutes away, so you may prefer to get a ride. My favorite aspect of the apartment was the Nespresso and I also liked that we could walk to many local restaurants and shops. A few repairs could be done around the apartment but overall everything is pretty and neat. We look forward to visiting Nantucket next time we are in the Cape Cod area."

Gerda herself was a great host, always answering our questions or requests within minutes. She even left us some extra waters outside our door, which were much appreciated.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed at Gerda's apartment for a few days of our honeymoon during our first trip to Martha's Vineyard and loved it! It was just what we needed for the two of us. The apartment honestly looks better than the pictures (the pics are great but I couldn't tell the full layout ahead of time. We were pleasantly surprised when we got there). For starters, Gerda's apartment is super close to the ferry. We drove and it took us about 3 min to get there but for visitors walking it's also super close. The good thing about MV is that no matter where you are, everything is really close to get to from this apartment and even the furthest towns are 20-30 min away (driving). We also got to MV in the morning and were able to check in by noon! This was great and Gerda sent us good morning messages each day. As for pros & cons of the apartment:
Pros
- Close to everything (shops, brunch restaurants, beaches, etc)
- Quiet at night even though it's by a lot of shops. We also didn't feel like things were super busy around us.
- Comfortable bed
- Great living room, bathroom, & shower
Cons
- There's a key for the apartment door but you aren't allowed to lock the door downstairs that leads into the building from outside. (This wasn't really a con for us because we felt safe the whole time but might be an issue for some guests. Not sure what the reason is behind this but it would be nice to lock the door downstairs too.)
- We made our own breakfast in the mornings but there's not a lot of supplies to make your own meals (1 skillet, 1 pot, no spatula, etc). This wasn't a huge issue either because we wanted to try all the good food on the island but if you're looking to cook your own meals, this could be an issue.
- The bed is great but takes up quite a bit of space in the room.
- No tv (again, not a big issue b/c we brought our laptop)
Overall, the apartment was great and so is Gerda. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","I haven't been to MV since 2019, I had stayed with friends previously. My first time using AirBnB and I couldn't have been any happier! From the moment we opened the front door, I felt like home. Bright, clean, calm... Jasmine and her family live upstairs and the only thing we could hear were the, as she put it, ""pitter patter"" of the footsteps of her son. As I told Jasmine, I couldn't have imagined a better place to stay. Just one mile to downtown Oak Bluffs, easily walk-, or bike-able. That makes time on the island a bit less stressful, trying to park a bike, than a car, in the summer seasons!
We had a list of things to do, places to go, and were able to add a few from the ""things to do"" book that others add to. Great resources, plus more in the ""resource"" holder above the table.
It was great to meet you and your family, I truly can't wait for a return trip. Jasmine, thanks for making your place feel like home, in an area that feels so much like home to me.

Stayed with kids","This place was mostly great. We were visiting family & not really vacationing, so the lack of a fully functional kitchen was disappointing. I couldn't ever get the stovetop type thing provided to work. The toaster oven & microwave are very small. The host doesn't provide any kitchen sort of consumable supplies (salt, oil, coffee, etc), so be prepared to purchase everything. If you are going to dine out for every meal it is fine, but it makes it difficult to actually cook anything other than microwaving leftovers.
My kids did love playing with the basket of toys! Some of them are SUPER loud though & I put them up for fear of disturbing the host who lives adjacent."

It has everything you need, and it's in a quiet, peaceful location but close enough to stores, beaches and ferries for an easy walk, Uber or bike ride (we much prefer having a car though, to explore the island!)
It's always clean, comfortable and inviting, with just enough space for a small family. The AC unit is great, but there's also a fantastic breeze that comes through when all the windows are open.
Highly recommend!"

It's also very close to a public library which came in handy on the day of check-out, as I had to attend an online meeting after check-out time. Jasmine let me know that the library has conference rooms, and it was very easy to reserve one just a couple of hours before I needed it. I just asked at the circulation desk and they happily accommodated me! The smart TV was great for settling down after a long day and watching a movie. I would definitely recommend Jasmine's place!"

The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was excellent. We especially liked the small touches - plenty of towels and other basic amenities.

Stayed with kids","This was a great location with easy, family-friendly amenities. The inside is well kept and adorably decorated for the Vineyard! It space was welcoming and felt like a home away from home. It's a short drive to many of the busier spots on island with parking on site. There's a bus stop nearby at the fire station too and taxi/Uber easily available on island. I loved the seating outside on the deck as well as the picnic table. My kids loved the toys. And the living space and games were nice for my husband and I to relax once the kids went to bed. As some of the other reviews mentioned, you can definitely hear noise from upstairs (walking, talking, etc.). We sleep with white noise on which muffled most of the noise but keep this in mind if you're a light sleeper, go to bed early or require silence."

With that being said, it's a perfect spot if you have bikes or a car. The house was warm and had good facilities. It was mostly quiet, but often the owners' footsteps could be heard walking/running in the unit above."

What a blessing it was to find a place 5 minutes away from our group....that provided all the comforts of home. I really appreciated having my own deck with the choice to dine in or outside.. Another featured that I really enjoyed was having TVs in each bedroom and also in the common area. This is an affordable deal and I will certainly considered next year when I plan to stay the entire week.

Walking distance to everything you need - including the Stop & Shop which was very reasonably priced for groceries and awesome local shopping a block away from the house. We also adored being across the street from the Black Dog Tavern and morning walks along the draw bridge were such a treat. The best part was the cleanliness, decor and Mike’s hosting. We highly recommend this house! I can still hear the lovely ferry horn…"

It's beautifully landscaped, has an outside shower and beautiful lighting for evenings outside.
The location is great. Easy walk to ferry, grocery store, downtown shops and restaurants. Mike gave us some fantastic suggestions on the area, things to do, restaurant, etc... He was super attentive and so easy to work with.
Thank you for a top notch property, Mike. We look forward to returning next year."

Great patio with nice touches including outdoor shower, comfortable furniture and even automatic mood lights on the fence posts and throughout the patio. Perfect size for a family of 4. Grocery store and ferry are right down the road, maybe less than 100 yards. So close that walking is actually quicker than driving. Very quick walk to a number of shops, restaurants, bakeries, etc. Neighborhood is more on the commercial side, so it’s not really quiet, but the trade off is being walkway distance to everything. Mike the host was so amazing. Checked in on us and even suggested rainy day activities during a morning storm. Such a great host. Thanks Mike!!"

Mike is a wonderful host. He made sure we had everything we needed and when we were missing just one towel he brought us extras very promptly! He provided us great recommendations for dining and things to do. Not only did we appreciate his knowledge of the island but he was spot on with his recommendations.

It really is two minutes from the ferry. We were in walking distance from all your basic needs like groceries, coffee, shopping and the best sandwiches we’ve had in ages at The Watershop. We slept so well, the bed comfy and sheets soft..we were exhausted and barely turned on the TVs although there are one in each room. Mike checked in with us to see if we needed anything during our stay - which was thoughtful. We had everything we needed. Love the giant swing in the backyard too! Mike also allowed us to check out later which was so helpful. Truly a wonderful spot and would highly recommend!!"

The location of this house can’t be beat as it’s just a stone’s throw from the Vineyard Haven ferry and incredibly easy to bring your vehicle over from the Cape.
Mike’s house is exactly as described and even more beautiful in person. I tend to be picky about a kitchen because I like to cook and this had everything I needed and more. Plus, he keeps it well stocked with coffee and has a nice Keurig which is perfect for your morning coffee. All in all, just a great place!"

The area is definitely busier then the rest of the island, though we stayed during the off season so we cannot speak to beach access or tourist areas.

Stayed with a pet","This house was perfect. The layout was odd in that the living spaces are upstairs and the bedrooms downstairs but it actually worked really well - particularly if you came back from the beach and wanted to go straight into the bathroom/bedroom to clean up and change (there is an outdoor shower but we were staying in November so we did not avail of it)! Note - the stairs is steep if you have difficulties going up stairs, there is a rail.
The house was spotlessly clean and perfectly outfitted with everything you could possibility need. The two full bathrooms downstairs and the half bath upstairs more than meet our needs. We were there for girl's long weekend away and cooked most evenings - great kitchen!
The location is a quiet residential neighborhood. Perfect for walking the dogs and and wandering around. It's long walk to Vineyard Haven, but perfectly doable.
Looking forward to returning next year hopefully!"

Stayed with a pet","Fran and Ken's place was clean, quiet, and exactly what our family was looking for in a quiet getaway on the Vineyard. We were able to bring our dog, which was wonderful. I appreciated their particularly home and furniture, especially given the pet friendly listing.
They provided kids toys, which came in handy for all 5 of our rainy days spent on the Island! Their communication was very timely, house instructions clear and the kitchen was wonderfully stocked for most meals cooked a home.
The only thing I would mention is the owner-occupied nature of the listing, which of course was totally fine, especially if there were any issues. I'm just not sure if it's mentioned in the listing.
We would definitely recommend staying at Fran and Ken's place!"

Fran and Ken were incredibly kind, helpful, and responsive. Their property is beautiful, inviting, and incredibly clean. It was so special to have the whole family together, including our pup! It was great to be in the Tisbury/Vineyard Haven area, easy to get everywhere and there was so much to do. Even as long-time MVY goers, Fran and Ken still offered helpful suggestions and advice. We hope to be staying with Fran and Ken again soon!"

They had everything we could have needed already at the house so it saved us have to pack up our entire lives just for a week away which was really appreciated! We will definitely be returning!

Group trip","The house and its location were perfect for our group of six on our first ever visit to Martha's Vineyard. We loved hanging out in the back yard, on the decks, and in the open concept living/dining/kitchen area. The house was very well-kept and had all of the amenities we needed, plus some. Fran and Ken were super responsive and gave great, helpful recommendations about things to do locally and around the island (restaurants, tour suggestions, etc.). We used a number of their suggestions when exploring the island and were glad we did. We also enjoyed the easy walk (0.7 miles) to Little Owen Way Beach from the house and watching the sunsets down the road at West Chop. We can't say enough good things about the comforts of the house and the relaxing vibe of the area. A truly memorable long weekend was had by all!"

The upstairs is a beautiful open space, very light, with lovely gas ""wood stove"", comfortable sitting area, lots of games and books, and a well equipped kitchen. There is a nice balcony with gas grill (actually there are two balconies!) There were plenty of pots, pans, utensils, and all the basics like salt and pepper and oil were in the cabinets. The location is only 5 minutes from the ferry, and is a great home base for spending time on the island. Oh, and dog friendly which was important to us. We would be happy to stay again in the future."

Group trip","If you're looking for an inexpensive stay on the Vineyard with top-tier amenities then look no further! Fran and Ken have an amazing home which is perfect for big groups. This is just about a 20-minut e walk to downtown Vineyard Haven but while you're on the property it feels like you are completely remote which is the best of both worlds. the sleeping arrangements are very convenient with 3 BR's ( generously sized) along with a pull out couch upstairs. I was amazed by the amount of space upstairs where the kitchen/living room is, it feels very lofty. Fran and Ken make a MV getaway possible with a low nightly rate compared to that of other rentals on Airbnb which are astronomical. I DEFINITELY plan on booking this home for future stays"

They even provided us useful information on places to stay on our travels to the area since we were breaking up the drive from Virginia into two days. Once we arrived there was plenty of information provided regarding restaurants, shopping etc. as well as detailed instructions as to how to use what was provided in the home. Sitting on the decks and looking out over the beautiful landscaping was very relaxing. We certainly hope to visit again."

I highly recommend making s’more‘s over the fire pit in the backyard. However watching movies on the couch was also a fan favorite. After exploring the whole vineyard it was nice to come back to their house and have it feel like a home for the week. Perfect for families and close to everything. My sister biked to Vineyard Haven every day. My brother and his girlfriend enjoyed the porch every morning. My boyfriend even proposed right down the street!

Downstairs you can shut all the doors to keep your pup with you and the upstairs open concept is great!!! We grilled fresh seafood the first night on the top deck and everything we needed was there. The house is centrally located to drive out to the main sights and best restaurants. The garden is large which allowed our pup to burn off some energy. There was ground coffee there which saved us the first morning since we forgot! Fran & Ken are super friendly and nearby if you need anything. We would stay here again and highly recommend to our friends!! Thank you for being great hosts!!

Stayed a few nights","Fran and Ken's spot is a great jumping off point to explore the Island. Close to Vineyard Haven, a short drive to Oak Bluffs and Edgartown and easy access to ""Up Island"". The space is clean, sunny and inviting. All the amenities you need are provided. Outdoor space is super. Definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting the Vineyard."

Stayed a few nights","This is about as perfect as it gets! Beautiful, comfortable, immaculate and in a glorious wooded setting. It is a nice (about 1 1/4 miles) stroll from Vineyard Haven. We even got a kick out of the neighborhood turkeys who greet you as you go around the neighborhood. Beautiful full deck overlooking the yard, where the turkeys and chickens from next door like to visit. No kids with us, but if you have them, it is also very kid friendly. Toys, books, games - even a kiddie seat for the toilet. Fran and Ken have thought of everything!"

The kitchen and living were spacious. It was just my husband and myself this trip but we look forward to returning with friends / family in the future. This was a great first trip to Martha’s Vineyard and it was made even better by Ken’s tips ! Beautiful, clean and charming home. Can’t wait to return."

You’ll definitely want a car to explore further around but vineyard haven definitely had the best shopping with tons of local artisan shops. Will certainly be coming back."

Stayed a few nights",Fran & Ken’s place is beautiful and would have housed a larger group than just us two. The walk into Tisbury is a stretch - walking to dinner is a hilly half hour walk. But the Cioppino from Bobby B’s is worth it. Incredible views abound and bike friendly paths are great - but we drove to them rather than ride everywhere. The roads can be a bit tight. If you haven’t seen the beauty of Martha’s Vineyard- you are depriving yourself of a treat.

The adults loved the big room too, perfectly designed so that everyone can chat while dinner is being prepared. Bedrooms are a nice size and even have TVs (not that we spent any time watching them). The place was immaculate and beautifully equipped for every eventuality. The location is ideal. Fran and Ken communicated regularly and provided us with a gazillion great ""tips from a local."" Highly, highly recommend. A jewel of a rental where we spent four happy days with our son, DIL, and 18-month-old granddaughter."

The large gathering space upstairs with windows and sliders letting in the sunlight, and two large enclosed deck spaces made this a perfect place for relaxing and socializing.

Winter on MV surpassed our expectations and was filled with beautiful secluded hikes with a warm home waiting at the end of the day. We were pretty self-sufficient but just knew that if we needed advice or felt that something was missing from the home they would have been there for us. It is also was appreciated that the canine member of the family was welcome.
We can't wait to return."

All the appliances worked, were clean, and every bathroom was well stocked (quality shampoo, soaps, etc). The outdoor spaces are well furnished to enjoy the massive decks on each floor! Only draw back is that the location is not very central, sometimes ubers have a difficult time finding the house- best fit for folks with car access while on the vineyard."

Stayed a few nights","Short story: Wonderful house (more home really), great hosts, spacious and welcoming.
We have stayed here twice, once with all the family including our local relatives and out of towners like us. We will stay there again in the future too, even if just the two of us in this large house. Quiet, natural setting but close to the island activity.
Short walk to town which we did numerous times as well as walks to the relatives home and Tisbury School. Great location on the island for walking, handy if you don't have a car at about a 7 minute walk to the ferry landing. Weather was favorable between the storms, so walking as a great way to get around.
Ken and Fran were very accommodating to our needs, both in the delay getting on island as well as providing for the 14 month old grandchild with high chair, baby gate and crib.
Not sure when we will get back to the island as we travel from rural WA state, but we will have Vineyard Retreat at the top of the list."

Clean and scenic setting, ideal for 6 or 7 people. Hosts were communicative and helpful, going out of their way to reduce travel stress (helping with luggage storage and even giving us some olive oil in a pinch!) and make our island experience wonderful. They live in a place out back on site, but are very much out of your space as a guest - they are basically a neighbor! Beds were great, bathrooms simple and clean, and the main living/dining/kitchen area is divine - high ceilings, huge windows with a lovely nature view, and plenty of comfy spots to sit and chat.

Stayed a few nights","The place is beautiful, spacious, quiet. Super clean, comfortable, and has everything you could need. The hosts are polite, thoughtful, considerate, and just the ideal amount of communicative. It’s fantastic they let you bring dogs, ours is basically our child and it was amazing being able to have him with us while we explored the vineyard. It was really like a home away from home, just a delight all around."
