Stayed with a pet","Once again, Jeffrey hits it out of the park. This is the third residence of his that I’ve stayed in and, like the others, I was extremely pleased to stay here. Let’s talk about location, location, location! You have everything you need at your fingertips here. All the best restaurants are right downstairs. Enter in to the building and you will find the most delightful furnishings, art work (some beauties by Jeff himself!), areas to relax in and the most fantastic gym! Upstairs in the apartment, you will smile at all the details, the quirky furniture, gorgeous bathroom, sleep in the coziest bed and pretty much anything you need (a kettle? A specific coffee maker?) he will get for you! Enjoy your stay! I did!"

The place was well stocked, comfortable, and very clean. We loved Jeffrey’s friendly greeting and suggestions for where to go and what to do!
We would definitely stay again and for longer the next time we’re in the area!"

Armory square is the hub of downtown revitalization and there are plenty of restaurants and pubs right around. We parked our car for 2 days and didn’t use it till we left. Make a reservation at Pastabilities while you’re here!

The apartment is beautifully appointed and felt like home. The location is perfect - close to many great restaurants, and the University. Loved the recommendation to see the piece of the Berlin Wall that is behind the Armory. Very interesting story associated with that. Thank you for a fantastic stay. It was perfect."

Stayed with a pet","We had a fantastic stay at Jeffrey’s place. Looked just like the photos and the building was beautiful. They were very responsive and helpful, went above and beyond with amenities, and even brought us a second comforter upon request. Felt like a high-end hotel. The only issue we had was that it was a quite noisy with construction down the block, and there were a lot of homeless people roaming around the area. So just be aware of those things if you’re visiting, and maybe bring some earplugs to sleep with just in case. Overall we had an excellent experience and would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay in the heart of Syracuse! Jeffrey and Adyn are amazing! Had a long talk with both of them and got to know a little about their stories which was very cool Fantastic location right in the middle of Armory Square district. We walked 100 yards to two FANTASTIC restaurants and there were others we didnt have time to visit. Lots of little perks staying here...picked up a lid on a box on the table and it was loaded with butterfinger candy bars, draft beer on tap was AMAZING. :-) The space is a exactly as described and beyond cool, a 150 year old building with exposed brick, tile floors. The Murphy bed was super comfortable. Stay here, you will love it! We cant wait to come back!"

Stayed one night","The price was expected given we were there for a Bruce Springsteen concert. When the concert canceled I kept my plans to stay at the Airbnb since I was joining my sisters to celebrate one of their birthdays which included making her dinner. Upon arrival to the Airbnb, i quickly learned that the appliance to cook on was an electric plate in the unit I selected. The host was able to accommodate a room change with a stove.
I was very grateful for the change.
The host met me at the entrance to give me a tour of the building, show me the security code to the building and then one to my room. The host was very responsive to my questions."

I also like that any time I've needed anything that wasn't in the unit (laundry detergent this time), Jeffrey brought it to me that same day. I highly recommend staying here! Just know that the only cooking option is a hot plate, I do cook quite a bit and it hasn't been an issue for me. The washer/dryer are in the unit and high end so they work great. Also, even though it's a Murphy Bed, it's super comfy and the sheets are very soft. I definitely plan on staying here again on my next trip."

Stayed a few nights","Rented this for a special staycation weekend and it was perfect. The host provided a very thorough check-in which was greatly appreciated and was available when I had a question about wi-Fi fairly late one of the nights. The apartment is even more beautiful in person if you can believe that and the location cannot be topped in Armory. My favorite part was the bed which was so comfortable and the bedding/pillows were lovely. The hosts also provided hospitality touches that were noticed and greatly appreciated like IPA on tap, some beverage options in the fridge, snacks, and lovely bath amenities. Thank you for a great stay - I will definitely return!"

Stayed over a week","The property is very beautiful and the pictures are accurate. Actually, I think it's prettier in person, I loved the details. The building is great and I the hallways are beautiful. I love the exposed brick inside the apartment. The neighborhood is fun and there's lots of restaurants and little shops. There is a market walking distance to get groceries as well. The apartment itself is cozy and comfortable. It's definitely more of a ""bachelor"" pad feel since there are 2 beer kegs and no stove if you plan on cooking. There is a hotplate however, and I got by with that for the 11 days I was there. There are also pots and pans and anything you might need if you do plan to use the hotplate. The microwave is also a convection oven which is nice. The apartment was very clean with the exception of the dishwasher not having been ran when it was cleaned before my arrival. I'm sure that isn't something that happens often and it was just overlooked this time. I did have to run the dishwasher myself and put the dishes away which was annoying since the host said he would come do it himself but didn't. The apartment is on a 3rd floor and the view is nice. The windows do not open so you can't get fresh air in but the climate control works great. Communication with the host was slow but my experience of him was great. He's super nice and accommodating. He was very helpful in helping me navigate the area and even showed me where the market, the bookstore, and other things were in the area. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and recommend staying at this property. It really is beautiful and clean."

Street parking or parking garage right across made it super easy as well. Jeff was an amazing host and made our stay even better. It was so great we extended our stay. Will definitely be back again when we are up in Syracuse."

It is a very safe building in a prime location within walking distance to restaurants and a short drive to the Syracuse campus. We arrived after 10p.m. and Jeffrey met us at the loft, showed us how to work everything and even provided my husband with assistance in planning a running route for the following morning. The loft is perfect for two and they have maximized the space in such a smart way. We will absolutely request to stay again in this wonderful property!"

Stayed a few nights","It was an amaizing, unique, aesthetic, clean stay. I never leave reviews, but I had to for this one. the bathroom has a built in speaker, the shower head is huge, has a roomy fridge, 2 keg taps, a dishwasher, wireless phone charger, and so many more cool gadgets that really bring your stay to the next level. I normally refrain from city stays, but I am so glad i didn't. The appartment was so cute and close to everything. It is 7 minutes away from the Destiny mall, 3 blocks away from a cute ice skating rink, and it has many great restaurants near by. There is a parking garrage across the street too that makes it easy and convenient for parking. The best part of my stay is that I was proposing to my girlfriend at the time and I asked for Jeffery to set up the appartment while we were gone... and omg. He made my proposal like a Hallmark movie, pictures truely couldn't do justice. The lighting, candles, flowers, all the candies and cheescake.... He made it so perfect. I would hands down, recommend this to any person that is looking to find an air bnb that will want help with a proposal in the appartment or not. I am not even the first that he has helped! Like I said I normally don't leave reviews, but Jeffery helped give me the best weekend of my entire life, and no amount of words could say how thankful I am that I asked for this wonderful mans help. Not to mention his communication was phenomenal. I highly highly recomend this stay to anyone prosposing or that wants a cute city stay near many fun and tastey things! (She did say yes btw!!)"

Stayed one night","My daughter and I stayed for 1 night at Idania’s apartment to attend a weekend college tour. The apartment was really lovely! It was well appointed and felt cozy, yet modern. Most importantly of all, it was impeccably clean. I appreciated the thoughtful touches such as having milk, coffee, sugar, bread, and eggs on hand for breakfast! There were also snack items and little treats which were really appreciated after a long day of driving!
Idania herself was very responsive and accommodating. We were able to check in earlier than the designated time, and she was quick to answer any question I might have.
This is one of the best AIRBNB properties that I’ve stayed at in a long time, and I’ll definitely book this rental again when I’m back in Syracuse!"

Stayed a few nights","Idania’s Yellow House hits all the 5 star ratings. Idania’s attention to detail shines through on all points! The home is squeaky clean, with an ample supply of fresh white towels and linens. The bed in the master bedroom is very comfortable, we did not sleep or use the second bedroom. The home is well appointed with a stylish boho theme. Kitchen was stocked with fresh eggs and other breakfast items. The bathroom was also stocked with anything you may have forgotten. Convenient parking off street and right next to the house. Communication was clear and responses were fast! I would definitely stay here again when in the area."

The place is new, very well equipped and stocked with all the essentials you may need. We felt welcomed and super cozy. We were there for just one night, but I think it would be perfect for longer period too or if you need to work remotely. Again, can’t praise Idania enough for all the little details she thought of in the kitchen, bathroom, etc. She was also very friendly and responsive. Bravo!"

The accommodations were comfortable, clean, and perfectly suited for my family's needs. Linda's kindness, attention to detail, and excellent communication truly set this stay apart from any other. We felt so at home that we didn't want to leave!
I couldn't stop raving about our experience to everyone who would listen. If you're looking for a place that feels like a home away from home, I highly recommend staying with Linda. I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again soon.

Here are some examples of her amazing hospitality: My son forgot his toothbrush and we were thrilled to see that there were extras in the bathroom closet; I forgot a hairband and there were extras of those, too! There was freshly ground Starbucks coffee and a high end Moccamaster coffee maker to make delicious coffee in the morning (there was also a high end Keurig if you prefer) . There were also many complementary snacks, filtered water in the fridge, and all the things you think you might need in a kitchen (creamer in the fridge, sugar, teas and coffees, ziploc bags, foil, all the appliances, etc, etc) . Plus, we enjoyed playing games from the game closet in the living room one night. Just delightful! We'll be back!"

It's one of those rare places that delivers on all promises and more. All the great touches and little surprises that harken back to what used to make this website great before tons of people started trying to turn short term rentals into a long term career and took the heart out of it.
There's a reason it's 4.99 stars with 155 reviews (as of this one). You won't be disappointed."

The kitchen was stocked well for cooking and Linda supplied muffins from Wegman's, great snacks, coffee and more. The neighborhood was quiet and safe to venture out for a walk. We had great Mexican food at Alto Cinco, only a ten minute drive from the apartment. Linda was easy to communicate with and responded quickly to any questions we had.

The first night our exclusive topic of conversation was gushing about how nice the place was. Yes, it looks just like the photos and yes, it’s pristinely clean. What we were amazed by though was the fact that Linda has thought of literally everything! There was a cupboard just dedicated to kids dishes. There were amazing snacks and muffins for breakfast. There were so many different coffees and teas to choose from. The bathroom has a box full of spare toothbrushes, nail files, floss, you name it. There’s pretty much nothing you could need that Linda hasn’t provided.
On top of all that Linda was an excellent host, checking in with us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Well, we did - big time! I would not hesitate to recommend Linda’s Airbnb. It’s very special!"

The house is big enough for my whole family (6 peoples), with 3 rooms, a dining room, a sitting room and a well-equipped kitchen.
Linda is very nice, she prepared a welcome card together with a basket of snacks. Besides, she bought us a box of muffins and milk for our breakfast.
The parking is also big enough for a 7 seater.
So we really enjoyed this stay, thank you."

From the snack basket and welcome treats, to the binders with details and restaurants, Linda went above and beyond. We stayed with our 1.5 year old, and used the provided pack n play for her.

The snacks and muffins were SUCH an appreciated gesture as our packed supplies were running low. The bottled water was refreshing as well. My son loved the couch so much that he gave up his bedroom to his little sisters so he could sleep on the couch. I couldn't believe all the provided supplies, especially in the bathroom. We only wish we had more time to enjoy everything before we headed out. Thank you for the stay!"

Stayed one night","“Lucy’s Place” is like the poster child of Airbnb at its best! I’ve never had a more responsive host than Linda. And her special touches were exceptional- including handwritten welcoming notes and snacks! It may be helpful for guests to know that there is no laundry on site, but anything else you could imagine needing, she probably has it covered. I think some guests would also appreciate knowing in advance that there is a long time tenant upstairs, but other than hearing occasional walking around, there was no noise or interaction and it wasn’t a problem for us at all. My mother and I stayed there just for a night and are only sad we couldn’t stay longer! Truly a home away from home. We wouldn’t hesitate to book again!!"

She included so many things that most host don’t and it shows how thoughtful she is. We literally didn’t have to leave for anything. I will be staying again! Thanks Linda ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Lucy's place was literally perfect. I have never stayed in an AirBnB before and was a little leary about it. Not only will I stay at Lucy's place again, but I also will probably not stay anywhere else when in Syracuse. Linda (the host) thought of everything. She even left us fresh milk in the refrigerator for our coffee and fresh muffins for breakfast, water, and a ton of snacks. You have everything you need in the house. It is immaculate, warm, and cozy! Linda communicated with us the whole time and even offered to come to the house if we needed anything. Every bedroom closet had a beautiful bathrobe for our use, like a 5-star hotel. You can certainly see that she takes a lot of pride in her home. Thank you so much, Linda! We can't wait to stay again!"

The kitchen containt more tool that you could need, and there is tea and coffee, and everything was clean.
The place is very calm and silent, we did not hear anyone. The climatisation system is a little bit noisy, but you will get use to it after a short time and it can be stop. Also, the climatisation and heating are very effective, and easy to ajust.
And you will feel secure there, two locked door and the owners stay there.
Idania is communicating fast and efficently.

Stayed one night","The host thought of every possible detail to accommodate her guests. Tampons, wash cloths, Make up wipes. I could have literally come with nothing but the the clothes on my back and I would have been
Comfortable. Idania was very welcoming. Her home is neat and clean. It’s. a basement apartment on ground level so you have access to the back yard. It’s really cozy. The area is located in a run down part of Syracuse but it does not feel that way and it’s pretty safe. It’s very close to the University and Destiny Mall and Super Walmart all those places are less than a 10 min Car ride away. . Idania is very easy to reach. I enjoyed her home very much and appreciated her attention to every detail possible."

It is a wee bit noisy from time to time being close to the ventilation system, but it's not too distracting. Overall, would certainly stay there again."

Stayed one night","My fiance and I were in Syracuse for a concert and we chose to stay at La Gloria because of its close proximity to the venue but we would easily stay here again in the future. We struggled with the key pad entry up on check-in and Idania was extremely responsive to messages and even called us to walk us through the process. Every inch of the apartment was spotless, pristine, and neatly organized. We were impressed with the amenities, especially the waterfall shower head and bidet. Idania provided a nice selection of food items such as yogurt, milk, eggs, bread, cup noodles, pasta, butter, and jelly. We really appreciated this personal touch and made use of the food to make a nice breakfast before checkout. The neighborhood was quiet and uneventful.
As others have already mentioned, this is a basement apartment and therefore ceiling height is shorter than average. My fiance is 5'10"" and fit in the rooms but he did have to duck in one area where the ceiling dips down."

Stayed one night","If I could give more stars I would. We were visiting Syracuse as a ""mid road trip"" place to land and rest for the night. We had some hiccups on our drive and ended up getting in very late which did not effect our check in at all.
At first glance, in the middle of the night, the neighborhood was tempting to judge. But ,WOW, were we surprised when we entered the basement apartment. Not only was everything as described, but it was also so much more. This place is all about the attention to details and is oozing with generosity and comfort. There are so many thoughtful touches that really showcased how nurturing our host is.
Our morning was such a delightful surprise as well. We discovered a beautiful garden to sip morning tea/coffee. There's a nostalgic swing set that the kiddos got to get some wiggles out... very helpful before our long drive ahead.
Idania's place is a gem... should we ever plan a visit to Syracuse, this is where we will stay!"

We had a downstairs peaceful place to recover from driving before and after my brother's wedding. The host takes care of the space better than any bnb we have ever stayed in. It was HOT outside so the washer was a welcome friend mid trip for the 4 of us. The space has enough room for my husband and two kids to hang out. The bathroom is very well stocked and clean. The kitchen area was everything we needed. Cups, kitchenware, irons, EVERYTHING. We were also very happy with how close it was to everything. Whether we needed to be at Green Lakes or in Syracuse, this was the perfect spot. Her instructions were awesome. The space was very very clean. STAY HERE. If you are in town, this space is everything and then some. ✨️"

She was very responsive before and during our trip and she was on-site if I needed any help getting in, which we didn't. Door codes were provided and it was a breeze to get in. Idania didn't forget a THING to make her guests feel comfortable and as if they were in their own home. There were so many toiletries were provide like soap, shampoo, First Aid kit, Q-tips, etc. ! But, best of all was a full breakfast! The fridge was stocked with brand new eggs, milk, water, butter and bread. Kitchen was stocked with coffee, sugar, soup and more! Although we brought most of what we needed with us, it was great to have all of that on hand to enhance our trip that much more. The one small comment I would share is parts of the area are a bit run-down, but we had no problems AT ALL and there was a parking space in the driveway for us. Idania's place is immaculate inside and out! Would definitely recommend."

She also left us oatmeal, candies, tea, bottles of water, and even cup-o-noodles. We especially loved the espresso machine and the espresso and coffee options Idania provided! Great shower, super clean, comfortable bed. The only downside was the fact that it’s impossible to set the thermostat at a certain temperature and leave it alone. The HVAC system doesn’t regulate itself, and we were having to adjust the thermostat several times per day. Also, there is no furniture facing the television set other than a giant beanbag chair that I couldn’t use because I have arthritis — so I could not watch anything on the TV. But the hosts were very friendly, and we would consider staying here again."

You’ll just need to do some research on the things that are around to do because unless there is an event going on there isn’t that much to do other than trying out the restaurants so that’s just something to keep in mind but the space was beautiful, well-maintained.She was proactive with making sure that we knew how to get into the space. She made sure that we were aware before we even got there; this may not always happen but the space was available earlier than the check-in time so that was nice to have the option to go in earlier than expected.

Though that’s typical of many of the older Upstate NY cities. Anyways, once we parked & got into the space IT WAS AMAZING. Truly had an island vibe tucked away in a Syracuse basement apartment. Idania keeps the space super clean & she had literally every single amenity you could have needed. The bathroom was super clean, the kitchen was inviting, & the beds were very comfortable for my family & I. She even had a crib in there that our 1 year old enjoyed! Kudos to the bidet in the bathroom too, that was our first experience with one & we are definitely going to have one installed in our own home haha. Neighborhood turned out to be very uneventful/peaceful and everyone seemed to mind there business which is all you can really ask for. Overall my family & I really really enjoyed La Gloria & would def stay again!"

The interior design is the main thing that stands out. The walls, floor, counter tops. The place was clean and shiny like it was prepped for a commercial shoot or cooking show. The huge bean bag chair was great. I love those. Beds were comfortable. The bathroom was OVERLY clean and beautiful. They even have a bidet if that's your thing. A crib if you have a baby. I didn't get to watch TV but a nice maybe 55 inch screen. Fridge was stocked with water, eggs, and other stuff. Oh and had a nice gated backyard to relax, even though we didn't get to use it. Communication was great. Access was very easy. I think there was also a wheelchair ramp for access. Washer and dryer. Con. Steep stairway entry if your mobile ability is less than 4 out of 10. Plug behind counter stools have shortage, but they definitely deserve the Superhost badge."

The fridge and kitchen countertops were stocked with breakfast basics. There is plenty of cookware to use should you want to prepare meals. The bathroom was also stocked with necessities. The bed is comfortable and warm. It is easy to get in and out of the unit. Idania was very responsive and kind to recommend salsa dance spots in the area. I highly recommend this stay for others visiting Syracuse!

Stayed one night","The apartment is clean and has a nice kitchen and bathroom area. The blinds are functional and check in was fine. Be aware it is definitely a basement apartment and the walls that separate the apartment from the unfinished basement are sort of a faux brick with venting that runs through the two areas. There is a barn door separating the two areas. I have chemical sensitivities, and there was some sort of strong fragrance but I couldn’t identify the source. I slept with the windows open but even my clothes smelled like the fragrance the next day at our next Airbnb. I messaged the host after we arrived (9:30pm), but unfortunately they didn’t see my message until the next day, so the problem was not resolved for our stay. They wrote the next day and felt badly. It wasn’t their fault as I should have written ahead and asked about fragrances, but other travelers should know in case strong, unnatural fragrances are a problem for them too."

There is a divider between the kitchen and bed area that you'll bonk your head if you're not paying attention. My wife being 5'9"" didn't have a problem with this.

On check in we found a super clean, welcoming space with crisp bed linens, enough cozy blankets and extra pillows.
The bathroom had stacks of fresh clean towels, small basket full of toiletries and a first aid box. The fridge had water bottles, eggs milk and bread. Coffee, butter and jam was abundant. I specially appreciated the kitchen area because it amicably served the purpose of my visit; which was to cook food to stack up the freezer in my college going son’s apartment.
If I have to do this again next year I’ll definitely choose to stay at La Gloria. It’s super safe, convenient and much more."

Stayed one night","What a lovely home! I stayed in a cozy room with a comfortable bed just off the living room. I was going on a last-minute trip and was so glad to be able to make my room reservation on the same day I needed a place to stay. Amy got back to me quickly to confirm the reservation even though Air BnB sets things up so hosts have up to 24 hours to confirm.
I might not have read the description closely enough, but somehow I thought Amy and her husband were going to be staying at the house, so I was surprised not to meet them in person. As a woman traveling alone, I was a bit uncomfortable being in a co-ed housing situation with strangers, but in my short interactions with other guests, everyone was polite and pleasant. I would just want other travelers to be aware that the two bathrooms (one full, one half) are shared by all the guests.
Grateful for this quiet, very affordable stay with hosts who were very accommodating and prompt with answers to my inquiries over email and text."

The furniture was all super comfy, with extra pillows, linen and blankets. The most pleasant surprise was the size of the apartment. It's huge! He could split the space into 2 and each would still be nice-sized. Karam was super responsive and pleasant, and truly a pleasure to communicate with. I would highly recommend Karam's place for however long you needed to stay.
Thanks again Karam, you were a gem!!!"

Stayed a few nights",Karam's place is spot on for all the local attractions within the city limits; as well as being able to get to many attractions outside of the city. Great location! All of the pictures and amenities are true down to the small details. The apartment is great. Had no issues and loved that we were able to house our vehicle in a garage as well- made us feel safe. That's the first AirBnB we have been to that had a garage parking spot which is def. a bonus! (And- we have been to over 20 AirBnB's at this point) Everything was very tidy and kept neat inside the apartment. Our stay went very well and we appreciated Karam's responsiveness and suggestions regarding where to dine at etc. Thank you once again for the smooth sailing on the back end last five days of our trip. Your apartment fit the bill! :)

Stayed a few nights","I loved my stay at The Retreat on James, and it was the perfect choice for my weekend in Syracuse! The apartment is so cute and had everything I needed. It was absolutely immaculate in every room, and the space felt so large and roomy for only being a one-bedroom. I had never stayed in this part of town and loved the location and the ability to walk to coffee shops and bookstores or across the street to Walgreens if I needed anything. The space feels very private, and I didn't hear any outside noise from the street or neighborhood. I loved having the garage space for my car and felt very safe. Karam was very responsive and checking in and out were super easy. I will absolutely stay here again when I'm back in Syracuse, and I recommend you do too. You won't regret it!"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely hands down THE cleanest Airbnb experience I've ever had! I have been using Airbnb for YEARS and have never had a stay this long. This experience was so great, I asked to extend our stay when we found out my father in law passed away. Unfortunately the space was booked but I would have totally stayed here another week. The unit was super spacious for my 6 year old daughter, husband and myself. Karam was super responsive and helpful.
The bed was so comfy. There were plenty of places to hang and store clothing which I really appreciated. I also loved the stocked kitchen which made cooking meals for my daughter so much easier. I was able to store our food in the fridge and make coffee just like at home. Karam has thought of all the details.
Finding a place to stay when visiting home is so frustrating sometimes, however now that I know of Karam's place, we will definitely be visiting again (sooner than later). Do yourself a favor and book your stay. You will not be disappointed."

Stayed about a week","I spent about a week at Karam’s while recovering from a surgery and let me just say that he went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and was as comfortable as possible. A few days before I checked in he messaged me to see if there was anything I needed and provided those extra accommodations. I was mostly bedridden the whole time so I can also confirm the bed is super cozy, comfortable, and clean! Karam had just about everything you could need while staying there from, extra toiletries to a cabinet full of spices which one does not usually think about while staying away from home. At one point the stove and TV had some issues working so I made Karam aware and within 24 hours he was coming over to fix it for us! Whether you need a place to recover or have a relaxing get away I highly recommend staying here!"

The place is easy to access and has a locked garage space which is a plus.

The place is IMMACULATELY clean, and very well taken care of. There were so many wonderful things about the space - private parking, easy check-in, updated/new furniture and decor, and qutie possibly the cleanest fridge I have ever seen! There were also many nice touches: free wifi, access to Netflix, a full Brita pitcher of water in the fridge, and the AC had been turned on beforehand so that it was a very comfortable temperature. There's a lot of natural light and the place definitely has a good energy to it. This place is perfect for an overnight stay, a weekend in Syracuse,
or even for a prolonged stay in the area. My family loved our stay, and they are already asking when we can go back! Karam was a WONDERFUL host. He was very responsive to any questions I had, and he always responded within a few minutes. I HIGHLY recommend staying here. Thanks Karam!!"

As my family and I were doing a spontaneous roadtrip, we ended up in the town of Syracuse and searched for a place to stay the night. Luckily, I have come across Karam’s listing. He was very responsive and accepted my request even though it was a last minute booking. He is very clear and detailed with instructions; even helped us with our needs when we could not do so ourselves.
His place provided us a very comfortable stay; very spacious, clean, and refreshing. It also had everything we could ever need and it was all new - from towels & beddings to pots & pans and everything else in between. The garage had more than enough space for our cars and the place is also centrally located to good restaurants and stores.
It was such a great accommodation. We look forward to our next booking with Karam!"

The residential neighborhood was pleasant and quiet, yet only a few minutes’ drive to a grocery store or only a 10 min walk with one busy road to cross. One tiny thing to be aware: if arriving after dark, the lights do not shine on the house number until you approach on foot after parking in the drive. When the lights came on, it was reassuring that we were not waking up another household, since we arrived so late at night."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great space, and I really only wish I had more time to explore the area. It’s a quiet spot that served well as a home base, and I really enjoyed having a relaxing breakfast on the back deck every morning. Everything was clean and all the basics were covered, although a toaster oven would have been useful. Aside from a couple of trails, there unfortunately doesn’t seem to be a lot to do or see within walking distance, but the street is easy to find and not far off the highway. The house number was difficult to see at night when I arrived.
Lynda was responsive and helpful with suggestions for me to look for landscapes to paint. The rain had other ideas on the day I was able to venture out, however, and I was only able to get one session in, on my way out of town. I’ll post it @worldseyestudio even though it’s not my best work, and hopefully I’ll be able to return soon for more excursions and practice."

Kitchen has everything you could need and we cooked and baked many meals and it was cozy to eat in the kitchen. Loved the washer & dryer in the basement, the Netflix on the smart TV, and the super comfy sofa, easy chair and beds. Wegmans, Trader Joe’s and many other stores are right around the corner for cooks! Bathroom is spacious and shower (and tub for kids) works perfectly. Tons of toilet paper, paper towels, Kleenex and shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. Everything is exactly where you need it to be. Even makings for coffee, salt and pepper, alum foil, parchment, and Saran Wrap. Seriously, its perfect and the photos don’t do it justice.

We moved a few years back and this was our first return visit. Lots of family and friends to catch up with. Charlie’s place was conveniently located near routes 481, 690, 81, and the NYS Truway. Close to shopping (Destiny, Target, Walmart, etc.) and restaurants in Fayetteville, East Syracuse, Syracuse and 20 minutes from Cazenovia or Liverpool. Also, close to LeMoyne College and Syracuse University.
3 bedrooms kitchen, living room, bathroom. Oh… neighborhood, very quiet residential.

Lynda has thought out all the details for BnB stays. The house is immaculate. It’s not full of clutter and chipped items. Many BnB hosts forget about the details: quality paper products (not cheap, sandpaper texture), using unscented cleaning products (plug ins are the worse) and creepy dolls or pictures in the guests’ bedroom. Lynda’s house is a great example of how to be a BnB host."

There is a wegmans and a gym right down the road too which is a big plus. We would definitely recommend and will be back for future visits!"

So many nice little touches: detailed home manual, all the charging stations, the welcome snack basket, a filled ice tray, bath products and much more. Perfect outdoor deck for relaxing and eating.
We have many friends and family here and this will be our “go to” home on every visit. Thank you so much for a great alternative to all the hotels in the area."

It was a short distance from Syracuse University. It has a great backyard and even though is was not fenced in it was pet friendly. The backyard deck and grill were the perfect spot for our family to gather after graduation. My kids enjoyed the extra charging pads for all their electronics. We all had a great time!

I was visiting with my mother while we searched for apartments for myself for when I move to Syracuse in the fall. Liverpool is much closer to Syracuse and surrounding areas than you would think. A very convenient and safe place to stay. Wegmans is just down the street and downtown Liverpool offers great places to eat and you can take a stroll around Onondaga Lake!
Kristina’s place was wonderful! Very clean and excellent amenities for the price. Everything you would need to be comfortable for several nights."

The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe and it was only 10 mins away from SU. We always use our own linens and towels, however, the linens/towels offered seemed high quality. The windows provided calming views of the snowy property, I wish we spent more time in the house to enjoy it but we were out and about most of the trip. I personally liked how clutter-free the space was, it was very refreshing. We especially appreciated the private parking and shoveled walkway!"
