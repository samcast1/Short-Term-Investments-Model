Stayed with kids",Absolutely beautiful home with comfort and lots of amenities. First Airbnb I have ever stayed in that allowed me to park inside the garage—thank you Paul. My group of six absolutely loved our stay! Paul and Hilary were great to work with. Hilary was kind enough to allow an early 2 hour check-in—THANK YOU AGAIN HILARY! I highly recommend booking this home.

Group trip","We rented the whole house with all 5 bedrooms and had lots of room to spread out. We had our family Christmas celebration and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed plus more. We had plenty of room to spread out for different activities. The neighborhood is quite but close to many restaurants and shopping. The beds were a little hard for our preferences, but might be perfect for others. We would definitely come back."

If we should decide to prepare meals there I know that we will not have any difficulty in finding the utensils that we need I’d like the two outdoor areas front and back of the home for us to enjoy the summer weather..

Stayed with a pet","Very cute older home in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed the fireplace and walking our dogs around the neighborhood. Everything felt very clean. I really appreciated that everything was labeled so I didn’t have to open every drawer/cupboard to find something. The house is dog friendly; however, there is not access to the back yard from the house so you do need to walk your dogs outside if you are traveling with them. Also be prepared to bring your crate or bring your dogs with you if you are planning on leaving the cottage during your stay."

Squeaky clean, amply supplied and thoughtfully decorated with lots of cool local art on the walls to enjoy.
Melissa is a great host who quickly responds. She also provides good recommendations to local food/experiences. Wish I could’ve stayed longer to see more of the area. I did get a hike in at Upper Sioux Agency State Park. Gorgeous area with terrible history. It will be permanently closed this year so try to see it if you have time!"

The backyard garden made this place very special and was great for our fur baby. The fireplace was also nice for one of our rainy nights. Good neighborhood, we walked around a lot."

Stayed with kids",Great stay! Clean and accurately described. Fun local artwork throughout the house. The backyard is not currently accessible without going around the house (they are working on a renovation that will improve access) so we didn't end up using it much but did sit on the front deck. There was a lot of fabric softener smells when we first arrived so we aired out the house a bit. Not a big deal but some may be sensitive to it. Great location and one of the few options right in Granite Falls. Happy to have been able to stay!

There were even a few games and a puzzle available to use. My mother grew up in Granite Falls and this place was located kitty corner from two of the homes her father built for their growing family. It’s easy walking distance to downtown or US-212 where you can find food, gas, and shopping. Don’t forget to visit the falls and the popcorn stand! My family and our pup truly enjoyed our stay and hope to return in the future!!"

In addition to incredible hosts that are available as needed throughout the stay, the place is spacious and clean. I stayed with my 3 young boys and had everything I needed to keep them comfortable and even closed off in a separate area while I worked remotely in the mornings and late evenings. There were ample plug-ins and fast wi-fi available. The home itself is in a quiet area across from the cathedral where bells ring pleasantly to remind you of the time. And it is within a few blocks of the main street of Marshall, making it easy to walk to and from several local restaurants, bars, and shops."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough great things about “Stella’s House”! Beautiful home which they have decorated with items & home decor which match what it could have looked like in the early 1900s. Front porch was perfect to lounge around & read up on Laura Ingalls Wilder which they have a few booklets on along with lots of other interesting books. Full kitchen which we were able to make meals in. It was a great weekend we went there with sunny & warm weather so we could check out Little House on the Prairie Museum in Walnut Grove, the train museum in Tracy & we also walked the groomed trails along Plum Creek. But if the weather would have been cold or rainy then we would have been more then happy hanging around the house reading or watching tv. You will not regret staying here if you are into the old days. I was hoping for ghosts, but even tho’ I tried to scare my husband & telling him that Stella is gonna come for him, she did not come for him & nothing scary happened…oh well…"

Stayed a few nights","What a gem, charmer of a place brimming with history! Super clean, beds are comfortable, you've got what you need in the kitchen, and everything works, also super quiet neighborhood.
It is exactly as the write-up, this house is over 100 years old, if you do not appreciate the beauty of that stay somewhere else.
I am not affiliated with the host in any way shape or form, but I find the negative reviews totally unfair when it clearly states this is a very very old house but they have done everything to make it look adorable, and as I stated before it is one of the cleanest places we've stayed."

Stayed with a pet","It's a beautiful, old home that needs some TLC. I enjoyed the peaceful neighborhood and small town; the neighbors were friendly, and people waved from their golf carts zooming around town. The history left to read about the area and house is interesting.
The toilet flushing is a concern; I am a minimalist, and things weren't going down. I had to use the bucket to flush to help get anything down. When I lifted the seat to ""flush"" the toilet was filthy below the seat - not my doing.
The refridgerator runs nonstop, the bathroom tiles are cracked, there isn't a sink stopper for the bathroom sink or bathtub.
The host, Tim, didn't message after checkin to ask if I had any questions or concerns. He did message clear checkin directions, and left some sticky notes with additional directions in the house.
I felt I had running water, AC, and a bed to sleep in, but was afraid/uncomfortable to use some of the things in the house because I was unsure if they would be usable or workable."

Stayed a few nights","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the lovely Stella house. It’s a sweet little bungalow, that also somehow has the feeling of a cabin, a cottage, and a Victorian home all rolled into one. I would definitely stay here again.
There is a display sharing some historical information about the home and it’s previous owners. That, along with the many antique furnishings, makes it feel like you’re in a history-house as well.
Other than the TV, the amenities are not shiny and modern. The bedding, towels, and kitchen essentials met my needs more than sufficiently. The house shows the wear and patina (and the quirks) of a 100+ year old home. I found this charming and beautiful. If polished, spotless, and contemporary furnishings (and pampering amenities) are what you feel you require, then choosing a different place to stay might be a better option for you.
I recommend staying at the Stella house to visit Balaton, and to explore the small towns, countryside, and history of Southwest Minnesota."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed the history of the home, everything was in working order. Host could do many things to improve stays for guests like tell where the front door is, which switch goes to what, where we are supposed to throw the trash, provide gloves for dishwashing. We didn't feel like welcome guests but instead felt our presence was a nuisance and urged to depart quickly.  Stays with superhosts  tend to be more inviting, I know because I am one, and it's a distinction that I'm very proud to have achieved, and work very hard to maintain that status by helping my guests to have a great stay.  I know you can't please everyone but you can sure try, and that's what Superhosts strive to do."

Phone signal was not the best and I have AT&T if it helps anyone. Not to much space for a family bigger then 2-4. Other then that Jared was great and his hospitality was absolutely appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","Nicely remodeled home walking distance to restaurants and Marshall’s Main Street. Lovely decor . 5 minute drive to the university. One queen bedroom with bathroom/walk in shower in basement. Basement room is nicely done, not damp or anything like that. (Note- Narrow stairs to basement.) 1/2 bathroom on first floor. Other Bedrooms are upstairs on Second level and share a full bathroom- 1king bedroom, 1queen room, 1 room with 2 twin beds . Good sized rooms. Bed and pillows were comfy. (Note to folks with mobility challenge-Toilets are low and entry to shower on second floor is high.) owner was responsive, everything worked as it should. We didn’t have any issues at all. Thank you for the water and welcome snacks. There is a train that passes very nearby. Does pass in the night as well. Didn’t bother me but very light sleepers should be prepared. Overall would recommend this home. Suited our needs perfectly for The Weekend Thank you for being great hosts!"

The house was very well stocked with pots, pans, utensils, spices (a whole rack of various spices), as well as Tupperware, Saran Wrap, foil, etc. This was the most well stocked place we have stayed. We met with our cousins and there was plenty of room to spread out, play games, cook, etc. Comfortable beds and furniture. Just an all around great experience."

Stayed with kids","We were in town for a wedding, so this place was absolutely PERFECT for me, my husband, our 5 adult kids and spouses, a two year old and a six week old baby. We enjoyed being able to hang out and visit in such a comfortable home. KaLea’s house was well equipped with everything we needed, including a pack & play. She also has it decorated to make it feel like home, including plenty of blankets to curl up in. I really wish we would have had more time to shoot some pool and just hang out, but if we ever need a place to stay in Marshall, this is definitely the one I would choose! She also mentions in her check out rules that we didn’t need to clean up because that is what cleaning fees are for….first person on AirBNB to note that! It’s not my nature not to clean things up, but it was just nice that it was pointed out. Some places charge an arm and leg for cleaning fees and expect you to pretty much do it all before you check out. Thank you, KaLea! Our stay was perfect!"

The home suited us perfectly. The kitchen was the most stocked I have ever encountered in our travels. Personal notes stated that we could use whatever we needed. We did eat a Tombstone Pizza and my son had a beer from the fridge. How accommodating is that!?

This was our very first Airbnb experience and wow(!) am I impressed.
The entire house is spacious and welcoming. It's absolutely adorable in the decor! There were all the comforts of home and a few amenities to make us feel so spoiled. We really loved KaLea's sense of humor! Definitely check out all the little signs and knickknacks around.
I loved that all our kids got their own rooms. It's something they don't have at home but it gave the kids room to spread out.
My ultimate favorite thing was finding 150 clever places to hide Easter eggs for our kids!
The check in and out instructions were clear! We appreciated the welcome message and guide book! KaLea was responsive to any questions we had and very personable.
I have so much more to say, but... character limits! So....
Just stay at KaLea's! You won't be disappointed!"

While a bit tricky to initially find, due to no fault of KaLea's but rather the road construction out front, I think normally you would easily locate! We found it to be central to the locations we needed to be and not far from grocery store as well. Lots of space and bathrooms for all !

What a great place to stop the noise and just be calm and feel relaxed. ‘Sunny’ place was just amazing and gracious. Her farm will be something to talk about for a LONG time. We felt at home with her dogs, Max & Sissy and her cat Ernie. What she offers for lodging at the settlers cabin is rustic as she says and it is so worth it. The sunroom lodging is beautiful too. We will most definitely go back when it’s the Wilder Pageant in July. Sunny, you are a gem💕"

Stayed one night","Because we're on a Laura Ingalls Wilder tour, we wanted more if a ""pioneer/settler"" experience. This 1880's cabin was great! And the remote location was so quiet, and the farm was great---chickens clucking around in the morning, the lovely orchard, etc. A great experience!

Joyce provided fresh baked pumpkin bread (from pumpkins she grew), delicious free range eggs from her farm and and a warm and welcoming tour of her farm, a true sanctuary. We would love to stay again - next time for much longer! Highly recommend!"

Joyce is very respectful of people's privacy and lets you decide how much you do or don't want to interact. But Joyce is a great story teller. You would be missing out if you don't chat with her a few times!

A great place if you love animals…two friendly dogs, an affectionate cat, geese chickens, turkeys on the farm as well. Really nice period cabin, good bed but remember it is a double (which we’re used to). Joyce was very welcoming and friendly. It shows that she is truly a hard working farm and nature lover. This place has an excellent vibe to it. Minutes out of town, it is a great chance to experience a country farm."

There was also a large bowl of her farm fresh tomatoes, onions, organic garlic, peppers, and potatoes for us to use. We stayed in the fall and it was cool but we loved it. There were stacks of blankets on the beds and the beds were comfortable. We enjoyed walking through her Apple orchards, hand feeding the pasture raised pigs, and petting the beautiful turkeys. Ernie the cat was wonderful and her 3 herding dogs were lovely. We cooked steaks and shrimp over the wood fire grill and enjoyed the beautiful night sky and the quiet. I absolutely will be back.

From the clean, beautifully restored 1880s cabin to the farm fresh eggs and homegrown veggies she left for my mom and me to cook with, this host went out of her way, at every turn, to ensure we had the best possible visit to Walnut Grove, as well as the most rewarding — and memorable — Airbnb experience. Ever.
If you’re planning a visit to this part of Minnesota — or just need a little respite from life — please consider staying with Sunny. Do note, urbanites, this is an actual working farm with (very friendly!) animals who roam the grounds and sounds — and smells — of nature throughout the day. However, I absolutely promise all of it will leave you feeling well rested, relaxed and at peace.
Sunny, thank you for such a positive, uplifting stay. I can’t wait to visit you again soon!"

We were welcomed with fresh pumpkin bread and ingredients for us to make a simple breakfast in the morning. The cabin does not have running water, but had a drinking cooler, providing cold and hot water. To experience life in that time, we had easy access to the host's home to retreive hot water to wash dishes used. For those who really want to ""rough"" it, an outhouse was just outback of cabin, yet for strickly tenant use only during our stay, a full bathroom with a simple, outside access was available for our comfort needs.

Stayed a few nights","Sunny and Merryweather Farm are both completely wonderful. We didn’t want to leave. We stayed in the Settler’s Cabin, a dry cabin, on the unseasonably cold and wet first weekend in May. There is a heater to each room; hot, cold, and rain water available a few steps away from the cabin, and a nice private bathroom for guest use at the back of the house closest to the cabin. We brought much of our own food to cook in the instant pot- but she had a nice electric skillet, coffee maker, microwave- and a nice larger mini-fridge with drawers and a freezer. There was plexiglass put over the screened in porch windows to ensure the warmth stayed in during the colder seasons. The beds were incredibly comfortable and well-appointed with high quality cotton quilts and linens. Pillows and mattresses were well thought out. She also left us tasty baked goods and some cooking essentials such as: farm eggs, garlic, potatoes, peppers and onions. Sunny has maximized the space and comforts of the cabin; balancing the necessities with the cozy-rustic character. It felt good to not have running water, to walk to a bathroom, to be a little chilly at times, to sleep under a mountain of blankets- and to be mindful about what one really needs to survive and be comfortable.
The farm itself is lovely, and I plan to return when things green up in the coming seasons. I am already missing Ernie the “much-to-say” cat! Max, Jack, and Sissy the pups will make you smile. Sunny has put much heart and hard work into the farm and accommodations.
The farm and cabin are a perfect respite from our constantly in-motion world. Do yourself a favor and have a stay."

From feeding the pigs apples to playing with her three dogs, I couldn't have had a better time. There was a big storm the night I stayed, but I was snug and cozy in the cabin. She made me a delicious apple cherry crisp and shared some of her veggies and apples with me. I highly recommend booking a stay with her. You won't be disappointed!"

We were greeted with the most delicious homemade almond cherry crisp which was above and beyond considering how busy Sunny must be on her beautiful farm. We loved interacting with all the animals and Sunny made us feel so comfortable allowing us to explore the grounds freely. She even gave us the history of garlic in the area as we admired her garlic harvest in the barn! We had everything we needed during our 2 nights there (and more) compared to most places we have stayed. This is a great place to stay to explore the area, or for a quiet retreat.

The screened in porch was so wonderful to hang out during the rain and for sleeping. The modern bathroom facilities are so close and appreciated as we are not campers. My daughter loved the animals, especially interacting with the sweet cat and dogs. The farm is a hidden gem in Walnut Grove, and learning about Sunny's farm and sustainability was so very interesting. She was a gracious host providing a homemade treat and breakfast basics to make the stay more enjoyable. I am glad we read other reviews as we did bring food to heat up for dinners, as there is not much around the area. The experience was also a great tie in to the Laura Ingalls Wilder era and our trip to the museum and historic sites in the area."

She had lovely organic treats waiting for us in the cabin. It was so quiet and peaceful for all of us.
Some notes for future guests... you may not have everything you want, but you WILL have everything you really need.

Stayed one night","We were very excited to stay with Sunny, and this stay exceeded our expectations - we are SO happy we booked this cabin. Sunny was so friendly and kind. It is important you understand that the restroom is detached from the structure (about 40ish feet away and includes 3 or 4 steps up to the door) - in case that is a deal breaker for you, and only the bedroom in the cabin is heated. The modern restroom was spacious and clean. The cabin and lean-to were comfortable, the full size bed was comfortable, warm and cozy. There is a large mini-fridge (not a tiny dorm room size), microwave and water dispenser with hot/cold water. There were farm animals, dogs and a cat on the property. The farm is only about 7 minutes away from the Ingall's dugout site. We would LOVE to stay with Sunny again, if we are ever back in the area! This isn't alway a guarantee, but Sunny also provided a delicious cheesecake dessert made from homegrown pumpkin, and homemade apple cake for breakfast! Both were amazing, and such a sweet surprise!"

Stayed a few nights","This 14 acre farm harkens back to the days when there small flocks of birds, a border collie and a beautiful cat to wander the yard. There's an apple orchard; I was lucky enough to be there at apple harvest season as I was treated to a slice of the best apple pie. It is a rustic cabin with all the homey touches that you could want - patchwork quilts, pressed metal ceiling in the bedroom. The bathroom is modern and it's in the main house. Sunny has made sure that everything is ready for guests by sanitizing the spaces, then not touching or accessing them once I arrived. You're just 4.5 miles from the county park where there are about 3 miles of trails to hike over looking ""plum creek"". At night, it is quiet - stars and clouds are readily visible because of the dark skies - no light pollution."

Stayed with kids","We had an amazing time at Sunny’s farm. Such a cute cabin and nice get away from the cities. We mostly hung around the farm relaxing, grilling, and interacting with the animals. We also went to the Laura Engals museum in walnut grove and Jeffers Petroglyphs. Sunny was very welcoming and such an interesting individual. She had pigs, chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, a super sweet good boy dog (max) and very friendly cat. Sunny was a great host- I felt we could have all the privacy we needed but always felt comfortable to ask for help or have any questions answered. The cabin was rustic, i loved feeling like we were camping with a fire/open screen windows/ using rain water, but still having the comfort of a bed and shelter from the rain. We stayed on a very hot August weekend so it was extra nice to have access to a shower and the large box fan did provide relief from the heat at night. I would recommend bringing all of your food for your stay, walnut grove if about 10 minutes away but there are not many options for dining out especially with COVID. We also were lucky to try some of Sunny’s delicious baked goods, homegrown tomatoes, apples, pears, and some eggs. I would also recommend joining Sunny on a morning tour/chores if she is around. We helped feed the pigs and get the full “farm life” experience. Although walnut grove seems to be in the middle of nowhere, MN.. this was one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had. It was more than just a place to crash for the night, it was a destination in itself. Thank you Sunny for letting us stay! We really hope to make it back some day."

They loved the free ranging geese, turkeys & Chickens just as much as my elementary child. We opted to do chores in the morning with Sunny, which was like another tour, and the pigs were neat for all of us to see & pet. The cabin is very comfortable with good mattresses and nice linens. We didn't really use the outhouse, but the Indoor bathroom with shower was modern and nice. Everything was very clean. The little fridge, microwave, coffee maker and water machine were convenient. We did use the wood fire pit.. which was a smoker, so works well. We brought our own cast iron pans & long spatula, otherwise there are grids on the smoker. For me, this was a big part of the experience because of the pioneer stuff and we love to camp. If you don't want the hassle of open fire, bring microwave food. There is a small freezer. In terms of camping this is not roughing it at all. There are outlets, lights, heater, sink , stocked kitchenette, 1 box fan (I would bring 2 extra if you are expecting a hot night) . Sunny is fabulous and so easy to work with. She got back to me right away with questions. Max the dog was very friendly. Sunny had Farmer's Market our weekend, and we were able to buy her apples, tomatoes, and 3 varieties of garlic! We will be coming back!"

Once you get there, Sunny and Max (the dog) will greet you and show you the adorable cabin and have you settle in. We found fresh muffins and fruit waiting for us. Sunny then took the time to walk us around the farm and give us lots of history and answered the million questions I asked her. My children loved the turkeys, duck, geese, chickens and pigs. My 10 year old even woke up at 6 am to help feed the animals and go for a walk with Sunny and Max. Sunny has fixed up the cabin to be so comfortable and you can use her nicely remodeled bathroom in the house. This is a fabulous experience that I hope to do again! We even walked away with a variety box of Sunny’s garlic."

Her property is beautiful, her gardens / orchards are amazing, and her animals are well cared for and lovely to have around. Her dog, Max, is a lovely lovely dog.
Sunny allowed us to do chores with her and she shared her knowledge and experience with us, as we asked questions. She is a sensitive communicator. She does not over share or overwhelm, but she is willing to share when guests ask. She is also a gracious host and allows for much privacy.
The cabin is a treasure, a piece of history that has been thoughtfully and tastefully preserved. Sunny has an artistic flare. She carefully selected just the right things to furnish the cabin. It is very charming. It was a joy and an honor to get to stay in this important piece of history. There are lights and outlets, a coffee maker, a mini fridge, and a water cooler for drinking water. She also allows access to a beautiful private bathroom, with it’s own entrance, that is attached to her house. It is a very relaxing place to stay.
Our family likes rustic, history, and a natural rhythm life, so we left saying, “best Airbnb experience ever!”
Enjoy Sunny and her special farm. It is her labor of love and she graciously welcomed us in."

We were in town to see the Laura Ingles Wilder locations in the area, and Sunny's cabin was a great place to retreat and get some rest after a long drive."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay at the farm! We loved exploring the beautiful land filled with an incredible variety of growing fruits and vegetables, and making friends with the animals including Max the dog, some kitties, the fowl, and 19 small (for the time being) pigs. Plus, the bird activity was spectacular - with the simultaneous songs and calls of many species it almost had a rain forest feel to me. We also appreciated chatting with Sunny and learning about her sustainable farming practices - a pretty amazing operation.
The cabin itself is rather modest, without running water (rain barrel only) or lights (though great natural light in the front room). But there are chargers, a small fridge, and we had access to a modern bathroom (in addition to an outhouse). So you're not totally roughin' it but it was certainly a more ""rugged"" way of living than I'm accustomed to! It was all part of the farm stay experience.
I would definitely recommend so long as you don't require all the frills! Though I know Sunny will do her best to accommodate... Just Ask!"

Stayed one night",I would highly recommend this stay for anyone who is looking to get out of the city and loves spending time outdoors and with animals. Sunny can keep you company as much or as little as you want and will provide you with everything you need - including great conversation! The property is vibrant and full of things to explore. I had a very relaxing and restorative time on Sunny’s farm!

Stayed with kids","Stay at Sunny's farms for the ultimate country experience. We are not a ""camping"" family but the kids love animals and nature. This was the perfect compromise. The rustic cabin was clean. There were picnic tables to eat outside and access to a CLEAN bathroom with shower/tub. The kids ran around the vast farm with Sunny's dog, Max. They saw pigs, chickens, turkeys, baby ducks, and they were in heaven. Sunny gave them ""chores"" in the morning like helping to feed the animals and educating them on sustainability. This stay was a highlight of our road trip west.
One tip: This farm is not near many restaurants or grocery stores. It is truly in the country! We recommend bringing a picnic, appetizers and beverages for your enjoyment. The place comes with a refrigerator, coffee pot, and microwave."

I wondered if maybe the place (very newly constructed) is ADA compliant due to wide doors and flat thresholds and layout of bathroom. Adjacent parking and private entry made me feel like hosts weren't hovering but they responded to any knock on their door for questions. Snow clearing by Kevin during my stay was excellent. Plenty of good lighting. The room is spacious so I could spread out my yoga mat to exercise. I have already recommended this place to other family who visit Marshall area. I will be back.

One caution: When we arrived there were several plug-in ""air fresheners"" deployed around the house - one in nearly every room. Plug in ""air fresheners"" are an irritant to many people (including my wife and I) and downright dangerous for some people with chemical sensitivities, asthma, or allergies. They should be banned in AirBnB listings, but at the very least, AirBnB and hosts should clearly alert guests if they ""air fresheners"" are being used."

Group trip","Leah is a Superhost!!
Where do I start???? Communication with Leah was very quick and friendly. The house was very easy to find, in an area that gave us privacy and tranquility. Check-in is very easy and when you enter the house you want to stay in it. The house is very welcoming and feels like you are in a warm place, at home.
The house was very clean, very tidy, it has everything you need and more to make your stay pleasant. The bedrooms are spacious and cozy, with closets for everyone's convenience. The beds, pillows, sheets and blankets allow you to have a good rest in the evenings and the room allows you to enjoy with your family as if you were in your own house. Plenty of clean towels, toilet paper, towel paper, up to “little things” for personal use in case you need it. Leah couldn't have prepared the house for us better because we had all we needed to make our days in Minnesota the best.
100% Recommended!"

It was cozy and a perfect fit for a “grandma slumber party” upstairs! We will most definitely book her place again!"

Not only did she refund our money completely, she was so kind and understanding about it even thought it was past the 24 hour deadline where she could of kept our deposit. She is wonderful and we will be booking her site again!"

Stayed a few nights",Jay’s place was so peaceful and clean. The house was on a cul de sac which contributed to the quietness of the retreat. We had travelled to Marshall to visit our teenage grandson and he fell in love with the house! It was below freezing wind chill factor and yet the house was completely warm and cozy. When we walked through the front door you could tell by the pleasant aroma of the house that it was clean. We walked around and sure enough the place was spotless. The beds were very comfortable and we slept like babies each night we were there. The house is situated close to all amenities like restaurants and stores which is great to know when you have to navigate through snow. We ordered pizza and had it delivered rather than go back out in the frigid temps. The only negative I had was parking was near unshoveled areas. There was a small walkway to get to the main walk of the house and it was covered in ice and I took a hard fall. Other than that there are no complaints.

Group trip","Our stay at Jay’s Cozy Lodge was great! From the moment we entered the house and were greeted by an inviting fireplace video on the HD, we always felt our Host’s attention to detail! The house was comfortable and cozy, fresh and new. Everything we needed was there from a well appointed kitchen for making meals, to comfy living room seating, to a round dining table for gathering around for meals, great conversations, and playing board games. The bedrooms were very comfortable and everyone rested well. Jay was very responsive to our questions and requests. He responded to our questions, requests and comments before and during our stay, and even after checkout -wishing us safe travels. The neighborhood was quiet and the house easy to find. Our wintertime stay didn’t offer the opportunity to take advantage of the nice outdoor deck and back yard. We will recommend Jay and his Cozy Lodge to family and friends!"

I loved the small patio outside and used it quite a bit. Thanks for adding this fun spot.
I had the opportunity to meet Paul, he is great to communicate with and I plan on making his place the first place to stay when I come home."

Stayed with kids","Great space, welcoming and livable for my family (2 year old and 5 year old) while feeling modern. They did a great job remodeling and updating and retaining the historic charms. Very tasteful decorations, I was impressed. So many air bnbs feel kitschy or Ikea to the max but not this place, very thoughful and unique which made it feel calm and special. Tons of space for a lot of people. Kitchen is small relative to the house's occupancy and no dishwasher meant we had to stay on top of washing, but it met our needs. Neighborhood was really nice, quiet even on weekend nights. AC was a big plus. The owners were excellent, so friendly and helpful, super responsive to our little requests."

Group trip","We absolutely adored staying at “The Parsonage”. Paul and Ruth have truly made this a clear top notch place to stay. As a local looking for somewhere in our hometown to come together to celebrate a friend’s bachelorette party in a low key way this was perfect. It is accessible to downtown Marshall and you can walk anywhere you need too. The home is beautifully decorated and has lots of space to hang out and there was plenty of room for everyone to sleep and be comfortable. Marshall, MN is very lucky to have such a beautiful location!"
