Stayed with a pet","The house was exactly as described, very well stocked, and the location was perfect for our trip. The communication with the owner was outstanding; he was very responsive and flexible to our changing arrival time. We traveled to Jamestown for the solar eclipse and our plans kept changing due to the unpredictable weather. Regardless, it's a great house on a nice, quiet street. We brought our dog and took advantage of the walking paths through the next door bird sanctuary. We saw whitetail deer, which of course she really enjoyed. Overall, it's a perfect retreat for a relaxing trip to western NY."

Group trip","If you are looking for a quaint, and beautiful home with antique touches and close to downtown Jamestown, go ahead and book it! Thomas had all the necessary modern amenities. The rooms were cozy, roomy, clean and well kept. We loved all the warm blankets and slept so well!
The kids had a lot of toys and board games to play and enough space to run around. They had a great time and wanted to stay longer.
Thomas is a great host, very accommodative, easy to communicate and quick to respond. My favorite part was how kind and flexible he was! He had everything ready for us to check in, enjoy our stay and check out smoothly.
We look forward to coming back again.
Thank you Thomas for the lovely weekend! You’re a special soul!

Stayed a few nights","We had a fabulous time at Thomas's house over Labor day weekend. Thomas was a great host- very fast to respond, so accommodating and a breeze to work with. The house was just as described and easy to find. The kitchen was well stocked with basic supplies and dishes. The outside of the house has a nice fire pit with wood supplied, a large picnic table and a grill and is a beautiful place to sit and enjoy the birds in the morning with a coffee. The location was a 10 minute ride to the Comedy Museum and 20 minutes from hiking at Panama Rocks. A Bob Evans and McDonalds are conveniently located just around the corner and down the road from the house. There are also several nice restaurants around the lake with outdoor dining on the water. We didn't get a chance to walk the nature path nearby but we did take a late-night walk through the cemetery and saw lots of deer there. Altogether, we had a lovely time at this property and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"

I brought some kitchen things with me because I cook and bake often and wasn’t sure how stocked the house would be, but honestly, you don’t need to bring a thing for your stay, kitchen related or otherwise.

There are AC units in each bedroom and the house stays very cool in the summer even without the use of these units.

Stayed a few nights",My husband and I booked this airbnb for the weekend with our kids and loved it! The house had a very modern feel with cute decorations throughout. It was obvious that the owner had comfort in mind while choosing items for the house from soft throw blankets to puzzles and cards available for some down time. It was big enough for my husband and I to hang in the living room while our kids had their own space to play and also had a large sofa in the living room where we were all able to enjoy a movie. It was a 5 minute drive to the closest Tim Hortons and a 10 minute drive to Wegmans/Target/Starbucks which was also right next to Lake Chautauqua. A previous review mentioned the proximity to the hospital and we also did not hear any sirens or traffic day or night during our stay. One of the best parts was the updated bathroom with large soaker tub that our kids had the pleasure of using. We will definitely be booking again!

Lori was the best host and clearly thought of everything a guest could need, including snacks in the fridge and any flavor coffee one could want. We will definitely plan a return trip! 10 out of 10!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is as nice or nicer than the photos, which is rare. Lori is a great host. She has a well stocked kitchen plus some drinks, water, lots of condiments and even some food items. The setting is rural but there’s a little traffic at times, nothing terrible and very quiet at night. Loved the produce stand which is walkable from the house. The only drawback was the stairs getting into the place. They are original, very cool industrial style, BUT very steep with excessively low handrail. I’d personally put up an additional rail for safety. So just be careful. Lori is a generous host and we enjoyed our stay."

Amenities were great from the coffee selection to snack items to towel items. Her Airbnb was very comfortable...had plenty of room. We really liked the décor. We especially like the availability of all the outlets in the living room to plug in our devices. I would highly recommend it to others.

She was immensely generous in giving us a very late checkout, to help us get some rest on our 8-day drive across the continent. She truly is an amazing host. Stellar is every way. Her rental is awesome. Really well designed, so many thoughtful touches, clean, decorated in such a hip and cool way, while still preserving a true historical feel to the unit. She’s done a superb job at creating a super fun place to stay. Didn’t hear the shop downstairs at all. Very private. We’re so grateful we found this treasure. Will absolutely stay again."

Loved the vibe of the loft. Very nice job of making it feel new and modern without losing the charm of a historic building. The kitchen was well equipped if you are planning on cooking.
Convenient location with a grocery store just up the road. Easy to get into town. You can be in the heart of downtown Jamestown in under 10 minutes. We went to the National Comedy Center and the Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz museum. Both were a great experience.
It was the beginning of April when we were there, so it was still cold outside. All of the warm blankets Lori provided were nice touch for relaxing on the couch and watching some tv when we came back after going out to dinner. This is the perfect place for a couple to get away for a weekend or a longer vacation. It was quiet and bed was very comfortable. Definitely the most comfortable bed we have had while travelling. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Jamestown."

She is attentive and available without “hovering.”
This was the perfect place to work/relax during the day before getting together with family in the evenings.
This is not a unit for those wary of stairs - as the stairs to the loft are outside and there are stairs from the main living area to the bedroom.
But if stairs are no issue this is a perfect choice.
I will certainly be back (if it’s not already booked!)"

We appreciated the easy check in process, cleanliness, local beer in the fridge (which we enjoyed in the great outdoor space!), tech-friendly set up (great Bluetooth speakers, including one integrated into the bathroom), the array of breakfast foods & snacks provided, and the excellent quality of all amenities. Lori was a communicative & hospitable host. We would wholeheartedly recommend this AirBnB!"

When the weather did clear up, it was a perfect home base for trips to Allegany State Park, Southern Tier Brewing, and Ellicotville Brewing.

Stayed one night","Hello, traveler:
There is one problem with this listing: The real experience is MUCH better than the listing! The photos can’t quite capture/replicate what it feels like to be in the space.
Seriously, this is one of... if not the best... AirBnB experience to date, for us.
The setting: A respite. An oasis. We’re city dwellers and Lori’s place was just what we needed. Farm across the street with budding corn. 1970 LTD parked nearby. Church diagonally located. Green grass and pastures abounding. History. Brick details. A lovely gift shop. Mourning doves. Humming birds. Much more.
Design: Lori’s got talent. Such sophistication and refinement—yet comfort.
Thoughtfulness: Get ready. Anything. Truly anything one could need: Cosmetics, food, drinks, utensils, ++, ++, ++. Want to cook? Lori’s place a place to do so. Don’t want to? Plenty of other options.
Deck: Resort quality. Lighting. Outdoor furniture. Grille.
Cleanliness: YES.
Lori’s flat invites you in… and embraces you in comforting luxury.
Regrets? We only stayed one night 😕.
Value: Uh, oh yeah.
Personal touch. Lori’s communications were warm, responsive and loving.
Don’t miss out on this place."

Stayed a few nights","A MUST STAY AT PROPERTY !!!!
This loft is amazing we have stayed at tons of AIRBNB'S but none that were ever this well equipped. We walked in to a welcome note and candies a great personal touch by Lori. The fridge and cupboards were all stocked for everything you could want to make breakfast, she even left a couple local beers if you wanted to try them. Keurig coffee pot with several coffee choices, many extras like French vanilla creamer, half and half, Starbucks caramel splash etc etc. I was blow away by the thought of details put into this loft.
Everything was spotless and tastefully decorated, very cool vibe great wood floors, brick walls just a very homey feel. The bathroom had everything you needed for your stay plenty of towels and wash clothes shampoo, conditioner. body wash etc etc, and the shower is roomy and good water pressure.
The lift is basically for a single person to rent, or a couple as there is 1 bedroom but very big, if you have a small child they could sleep on couch or floor in sleeping bag.
Lori also owns a super cure store below the loft that carries tons of candles, as well as different, unique pieces, something for every occasion and for both men and woman.
There is also a back covered porch you can use with a BBQ grill and chairs with cushions super chill.
I could go on and on about this place but just take my word you will not be disappointed worth every penny, and close to grocery, gas, dollar stores. and restaurants."

Also, the shop downstairs is super cute, and If you have the time, I highly recommend popping down there for a browse.
We originally planned the trip around hiking in the Allegheny National Forrest. The location was great for that, and we didn’t have to travel too far for the hikes we wanted to complete.

Stayed a few nights","Book this place, now. Originally we were looking at spaces in Bemus Point / Lake Chataqua area. Loris space popped up however we thought it may be too far out of the way. Given the stylish pics of the apartment (which don’t even do this cute place justice), the amazing price point, and the safeness of the area we decided to take a chance and book. Wow! So glad we did! Lori is a great host, left a happy birthday note and a mini bottle of wine for me, not to mention a stocked fridge of all the necessities. Her back porch is so homey- loved sitting out there at night with a cup of tea playing cards ( which she also had! I’m telling you, she thought of it all). My only regret is not checking out the gift shop. It’s only open on Saturdays, so I may need to take a trip up sometime as it looked so cute. And! Location is fine- definitely not too far away from Bemus Point. And I would highly recommend dinner at the Lakehouse Tap and Grille. Well exceeded my expectations. Book book book! Oh, and Lori is super quick to respond and had many helpful hints regarding biking and kayaking - check out Longpoint State Park."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying here! Out of all my Air bnb experiences this one might take the cake. Everything you could need from Asprin and a blow dryer to the SOFTEST towels and wash clothes ever, a stock pile of extra blankets, bottled water and some staple fridge food and stocked pantry, I've honestly never seen a host go so far for their guests! Lori was prompt with responding to questions and even went out of her way to search where a farmers market was for us. I would reccomend staying here for sure, it is about 15 to 30 minutes away from a few spots depending on what you're looking to do but even the drives are beautiful so they seem shorter than that. The place it self is cozy yet spacious, updated and very clean, I loved the style of it."

We were given important emergency info and ideas of things to do in the area. the host was very nice and gave replies to questions very fast. Overall 10/10 would come back.

We highly recommend considering Lori’s place for your next adventure to Jamestown. We most certainly will!!! Thank you again Lori."

Stayed a few nights","My girlfriend and I had an excellent weekend experience, thanks to our host, Lori. The loft is very tastefully restored and decorated, Lori's thoughtful touches were extremely welcoming and amenities were carefully and comprehensively provided. If anything, we felt that the loft exceeded our expectations based on the photos - it's beautiful! As hosts ourselves, we are encouraged to ""up"" our game and incorporate some of the hospitality tips that we learned from Lori. The location is excellent, just minutes from conveniences in downtown Jamestown but private in a quaint countryside setting. We had an excellent Valentine's dinner at Forte, enjoyed the Winter Festival in Mayville and spent some time trying some of the beers and cocktails that Southern Tier Brewery and Distillery had to offer. Lori's recommendations in the Local Guide were spot on! Lori was communicative and warm, and check-in on a keypad was a snap. There was very little room for ambiguity in terms of parking, location, etc. She left us some Valentine's candy and a personal note, which was much appreciated. We will be talking about the loft for some time and will certainly be recommending it to others. And perhaps we'll come to visit again, maybe during warm weather to enjoy more of the outdoor activities in the area (the lake, etc). Highly recommend!"

Also, parking was very easy! Since we were there from Fri-Sun, it was free in the ramp across from the apt.
Bill & Scott were also extremely helpful and responsive to questions leading up to our trip, and they leave a booklet (binder) full of recommendations and useful information. Most everywhere in Jamestown is within a 10min walk - BUT most shops were closed by 3-4pm. So, prepare for short drives/explore outside Jamestown.
All-in-all a great trip and fantastic space!"

Every detail is attended to from the welcome basket you find upon walking in, to the information needed for watching TV.
Everything we could have needed was there. And the ease of communicating with Bill & Scott really makes you feel welcome. They even have a personal touch inside the loft on the board which includes their contact #s, our names were added there - super cute.
The bed is so comfortable as is the other furniture too. I especially appreciated the vanity in the huge walk-in closet area. It's nice to be able to sit while doing make up and skin care. There were many extras in there and more than enough space to hang up clothes.
We had great communication with the hosts all throughout our stay beginning with a message to let us know we could check-in early.
'Super Hosts' may not be good enough to describe these tremendous hosts!"

Perfect place for a family or a work trip as there are many above and beyond convinces such as children friendly dishes, huge closet (a small room really) big enough to house a travel crib (which is also provided) and a dedicated work space. I came to town to bake a cake for an anniversary party and the kitchen is a dream. Also having the ability to access my streaming service accounts on the tv in the living room and bedroom was a nice bonus. The coffee bar was also very appreciated.

Next was the dressing room where we could unpack and lay everything out to repack. I could go on and on with all the amenities in this place. The decor, the beautiful, large windows which actually opened, the coffee machine, an actual desk to put our computer, the high-end cookware, the location close to the comedy center and river walk just to name a few.

When we opened the door to the apartment, we were surprised by the large space and quality finishes. The pictures do not do it justice. As we explored further, we found many thoughtful touches left by our hosts that made it feel like a home away from home.
The apartment is in a central location, great for visiting family and for walking to restaurants and attractions. We enjoyed morning walks along the river, something I never did when I lived in Jamestown! A pass is provided for the parking garage next to the unit; metered spaces on the road are free nights and weekends. We could clearly see our car from the window, a fact I was grateful for when I couldn't remember if I'd closed the trunk.
We've already recommended this place to friends and family, and we're looking forward to returning some day."

Stayed a few nights","What a fantastic rental. The photos and description are spot on. However, it’s so much better seeing it in person. Ironically, since it’s located on Main Street, it was rather quiet. The bed was comfortable, the separate bathroom from the shower area was very convenient. Modernly decorated and so much better than a hotel. Communication and check in were perfect. We would definitely rent this again…so close all the attractions Jamestown has to offer."

Two AC’s were provided and they kept the place at the perfect temp. The bed was comfy; every amenity you could need was thought of and available to us (mini toiletries, iron, hair dryer, basket of snacks, umbrellas, laundry, plenty of towels, plenty of hangers, makeup wipes, I mean everything). They provided recommendations of where to eat and what bars to go to, parking was super easy and free, right across the street. I can’t say enough good things about this Airbnb, do yourself a favor and stay here if you’re ever in Jamestown!"

After a fun little night out in Jamestown, we got cozy with some wine and listened to the Fleetwood Mac and Elton John vinyls, among many others at the place.
The location was a perfect stop for our ski trip, as we hit Holiday Valley (Ellicottville) on Saturday and Peek n Peak on the way back to Cleveland on Sunday. Thanks again, and we will definitely keep this place in mind on our next trip to NY."

The hosts had great---and even personalized---attention to detail, and the loft is extremely clean, stylish, and spacious. It is in an excellent downtown location, walkable to the main things Jamestown has to offer, including the National Comedy and Lucy/Desi museums (which we were unable to visit this time, but highly recommend to all based on past experience). There were lots of thoughtful amenities and extras. Though with our short overnight stay we did not use most of them, the hosts seem to have thought of everything, including super-soft towels, lovely linens, a well-equipped and beautiful kitchen, a sound machine, charging devices, lighted makeup mirror (in a lovely dressing room), local travel and history books, umbrellas, extra tooth paste, a selection of snacks and coffee, and even a record player with records. I am sure I am still missing many other special treats, but suffice to say it is far beyond what you will find at most Airbnbs. The only downside is that we didn't stay longer, but we hope to come back in the future."

This apartment is amazingly well-done with lots of room to gather and room for privacy. Also, you could walk in with a bag of clothes and have everything you need for a comfy stay for days.
Bill + Scott were very communicative, the space is impeccably set up with lots of amenities and extras, and the location was fine. We parked across the street for free, and although we weren't out at night, we felt safe and secure. I really can't explain how much we enjoyed our one night here - we'll definitely be back when we have more time to explore the area. Also, bonus points for this town being the birthplace of Lucille Ball.
Easy walk to coffee, food, and local things to do. Definitely stay here! You'll be glad you did."

Whether you're looking to stay in the area for an evening or a week, if Loftz31 is available, your search is over. The pictures online show off the loft's classy and fun character but you can't even begin to appreciate all of special touches put into this stay until you've been there yourself. Book it! Thank you for the BEST stay in Jamestown, NY. We'll be back soon."

The bedroom had a soft fluffy carpet and the bed sheets smelled fresh out of the dryer. I personally liked the amount of natural light that came into the apartment it was great for taking photos and at night their was a warm fireplace to snuggle up by. I also really appreciate the effort they put in to make the place child friendly with outlet covers, an extra sippy cup and even a play pen. Will reccomend this place to a friend and will be back next time I'm in town. Big thanks to Will and Scott. :)"

Our family of four stayed to visit I love Lucy attractions on our way to buffalo and we’re glad we did. She was super thoughtful when considering her guests and their comfort. The place had old school charm with modern touches. We loved that she had everything we might need. Both rooms had TVs she offered tons of extra bedding pillows and towels for us to use. Personal touches were added like board games stuffed animals and a crib for our little one. Not to mention the area is absolutely gorgeous she has a beautiful yard to enjoy as well and everything you need is within a short distance. Would love if we could bring her place with us on all our trips! Hope to see her place again. Thank you for such a memorable stay!

The kids were disappointed that they couldn't play in the yard.

Stayed one night","Nina and Russ were far more than gracious hosts. I wish there were more than 5-stars to give them! We needed auto repair upon arrival and immediately they sprung into action to find us a mechanic. Not only that, they drove us miles in and out of their county for the repair shop, meals and sightseeing. Through this we also learned a lot of history of the region. I must add that this very generous couple put aside their busy schedule to accommodate our needs. Incredible!
Their home is warm, comfortable and quiet. A most wonderful stay.
We highly recommend Nina and Russ's home and look forward to staying again; and definitely plan on doing that before the Fall."

Having morning conversations with them with a cup of coffee is my favorite part about the stay. Both Nina and Russ are very interested in who the people are that stay with them and are genuinely curious about your walk of life. It makes for a very welcoming feel after conversating a while and getting to know them. The house is immaculate, clean, and tidy.

Stayed one night","What a treasure, highly recommend! Nina and Russ really went above and beyond. If you’re looking for a great stay in a warm and welcoming home, this is the place to book! Clean, cosy, and opportunity for great conversation! Also a super comfy bed, fluffy towels and an amazing shower!
They were very attentive, helped me with my bags and made me a delicious fresh juice in the morning! Jamestown has a surprisingly rich history and it was very interesting to learn all about this from Russ. I could have spoken to Nina for hours, but had to set off again as I was only stopping briefly during my roadtrip and time was getting on. They are such a lovely couple and I know where to go if I’m ever in the area again!"

We were surprised, while Jamestown itself is a cool small town in Chataqua County, Russ and Nina are the ideal hosts. They both had a lot of knowledge, and although retired remain active in the community. I am thankful that we got to meet them. The place itself is beautiful, the room is top tier, the bed is cozy, the shower was hot and had great pressure. Additionally they have taken extra precautions installing special air filters in the light of COVID.
If passing through the area I definitely recommend staying here."

The view of Lake Chautauqua is stunning! The house is located on the lake only a few steps off the patio. The patio and fire pit are enjoyable and relaxing. There is a large outdoor grill which we did not use. It is quite private on the patio considering the neighboring houses are close together. Farrah is very responsive and communicates very well. This is a very cozy house for a small family or group. The living room does not have a television, however both bedrooms have televisions. Being on vacation we did not need to watch tv.

The house itself is decorated beautifully and sparkling clean. Everything is new and the beds were so comfy. The kitchen is wonderful. Farrah even left us wine and snacks! We had a wonderful time sitting by the water with a fire. Honestly, if you want a getaway that feels like you stepped into a Nancy Meyers movie, rent this home!! It’s everything you need to feel like a proper coastal grandma."

We can't wait to come back. As soon as my wife walked in, she wished we were staying a week. We only booked a weekend getaway.

Stayed with kids","This magical little cottage on the lake is exactly what my family of 3 needed after a long stint of traveling. We stopped halfway between where we were visiting and home for a night. We had such a good night sleep and woke up to what seemed like an enchanted, mist covered lake, complete with birds flying back and forth. Our 2 y.o. was thrilled and spent most of the morning throwing rocks and pebbles into the water.
Farrah was a lovely host. We felt very welcome from the sweet message welcoming us to the thoughtful and age appropriate board books in the bedroom. She was very communicative and made sure we had everything we needed.
We are already planning another, longer visit to this sweet lake town and hope we can stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The layout of the rooms was a bonus for us. It was nice to have the bedrooms and full bath on the third floor away from the living space when we had people over. When you were in one of the bedrooms, it was nearly impossible to hear people talking or listening to music downstairs. We were there for one Saturday night when the bar and restaurant were open, and while we could hear noise, it wasn't intrusive. On our last morning, the restaurant smoke alarm went off briefly very early (which brought the emergency vehicles), but thankfully the building was cleared right away and deemed safe. Jonathan was quick to send a gift card as an apology for the inconvenience, something we hadn't expected but spoke to his hospitality and thoughtfulness. The apartment was a very comfortable home away from home, and we look forward to returning."

It was a bit confusing for us getting in bc the bar wait staff told me to go in a different door that was not the correct one, this wasnt any fault of the owner and logically during a regular stay wouldnt have been blocking the way in. The inside was a great place. We hung out in the dining room with our friends. The shower was good. Both bedrooms had tvs but not in the living room. We didnt need them anyway. Bed was comfortable. The owner even gave us 2 passes for the fest! The artwork was super cool and is for sale if you want to buy it. We ate breakfast at a great place the next morning close by started with an L right down the street. Overall I would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Jonathan was super responsive and helpful. Great location if you’re in town to visit the Lucy Desi Museum, Comedy Center, etc. Parking was convenient on street and in the parking garage up the street. Really cheap parking and free on weekends in the garage. Everything was walkable. House was reasonably clean, but has many quirks due to age. Lots of stairs. Lots and lots of stairs. Very steep and narrow stairs, so anyone that has difficulty walking up stairs will have a LOT of trouble. Beds were comfortable and clean. All of the Rooms and bedrooms were a good size. The kitchen is smaller but has many amenities. The bathroom door doesn’t stay closed upstairs, but you can easily put the stool against it to keep it closed.
TVs in both rooms, but not down in the family room, but not a deal breaker. We enjoyed the art and homey feel of the apartment.
Sauce is a great restaurant for dinner and literally around the corner. Labyrinth was awesome too! Thank you again to Jonathan!"

It is in an old but interesting building. It was also very quiet for being right in the middle of town. We could hear the restaurant below just a little bit while in the living room, but not at all while upstairs in the bedrooms. It wasn’t a bother at all. The apartment has lots of character. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking including spices and oil, etc. we parked for free in the parking garage a block away for free on the weekend, only $5 on weekdays. Very central and convenient, we highly recommended!!"

We had a great time playing board games in the comfortable living room. You were able to hear conversations from the restaurant below while on the first floor but not on the second. We were able to walk to dinner at Sauce which was a fabulous Italian restaurant! We walked directly downstairs at Labyrinth for coffee and desert which was equally as good. The next morning we hit up crown street roasting company, less than a block an away for some amazing breakfast!!! This place is a great alternative to a hotel room for families look for a getaway or place to stay heading to the slopes."

Stayed with kids","Inspiring style in a great location! My sister-in-law and I took my mum and our 4 little girls on an I Love Lucy pilgrimage to Jamestown and Jonathan's AirBnb apartment was the perfect location, size and style to make it a memorable and seamless trip! Jonathan was so accommodating, quick to respond, and the decor was so trendy and historic at the same time. We all felt completely welcome, and there were so many thoughtful touches. The 2-storey apartment was spacious and even boasted the biggest, most comfortable blow-up bed you could imagine! Thank you to Jonathan and his co-hosts for making our stay perfect. The I Love Lucy board game was the icing on the cake!
In terms of Jamestown itself, we did find it hard to find a restaurant or things to do outside of all the Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz historic sites. We ended up picking up pizza and doing without wine after several attempts on Sunday evening to find a restaurant or good take out with wine.
That said, the surrounding nature was gorgeous, especially on a wonderful fall weekend in October."

Stayed one night","We stayed here for 1 night to break up a 10 hour road trip, but as soon as we walked in we felt we could have stayed for much longer — this place definitely feels like a home away from home! The thoughtful vintage furniture, local art, living room, and fully functional kitchen had me convinced this would be a great long term stay. We booked in a hurry based solely on the reviews that mentioned the comfortable bed (in a convenient geographical location between our origin and destination of course), but I hadn’t realized how spacious it is, too. I wish I had taken a moment more to figure out there isn’t on site overnight parking ($5/day at the parking garage down the block, not bad), and that most of the cafes/ bars/ restaurants mentioned in other reviews don’t appear to be open on Sunday nights or Monday mornings — but thats on me! This was an oasis on our very long drive and Jonathan was a super nice and responsive host who provided everything we needed for our stay."

Jonathan was a message away with a quick response. The apartment is in a great location. Truly, what made the apartment was how personalized it is. In each room, you’ll find written notes about the decor and art work. The apartment really celebrates the local life with brochures, the Airbnb listing has ideas on what to do/eat, local art work, even the mattresses (which were very comfortable) were bought local. It was an experience being in a downtown apartment with levels. There are numerous stairs to the first level of apartment and up to the bedrooms - but do not let this deter you from choosing this location. You can feel at home in this apartment."

Everyone was happy with the bedroom arrangements and 1 and 1/2 bathrooms worked out. The self check-in and out was perfect and easy garage parking within a short walking distance. A nice bonus was Labyrinth Press Co & Brazil located right below us. We had drinks and dinner there the first night, and breakfast and lattes in the morning before heading out for the day."

So beyond helpful and everyway. Place was neat and clean, tons of charm, very comfy bedding in a pretty cool city with tons of history. Close to Charaqua lake and wineries in the lake Erie area. I love the vibe of the whole city. I am glad I stayed here."

Also it was really quite - good thick walls - even though we were right downtown. It is located very close to multiple beautiful hiking areas. I highly recommend going to the National Comedy Center and Lucy/Desi Museum, both within easy walking distance."

Stayed a few nights","Lovely two-storey townhouse with an exterior and architecture that channels 19th century France and interior decor that channels 1920s-40s America. An incredible amount of attention and detail went into the selection of every piece of artwork, furniture, and decoration, and Jonathan deserves commendation for it.
To discuss substance as well as style, the apartment was thoughtfully laid out (living and dining rooms downstairs, bedrooms upstairs) and the beds and furniture were all extremely comfortable. The full kitchen (including dishwasher) and in-unit washer/dryer were handy for the more practical aspects of our stay. And the location was a short walk to almost anything in downtown Jamestown, from numerous cute restaurants (of which there will be even more post-COVID, I am sure) to the National Comedy Center (a must-visit, and really do plan to spend minimum 2 hours there).
Last but certainly not least, Jonathan was extremely responsive (3 mins!) to all messages and queries, and no question was too large or too small for him to answer quickly and thoughtfully. His hospitality made our stay a seamless and pleasant one.
Highly recommend if you are ever in - or looking to make a long weekend visit to - the area!"

We were only a short drive to Southern Tier - our all- time favorite brewery. The only thing we didn’t expect was that you do have to climb several flights of stairs since the apartment is on the third floor- but the stairs are inside the building so once you get luggage upstairs they are fine. We had 2 couples stay here and we all loved it and highly recommend it. We thought it was a great value- beautiful, clean, convenient and affordable!"

Heads up that during the week there is two hour free parking during business hours. We decided to leave a day early due to bad weather and would have liked to stay in the apartment or visit the I Love Lucy Museum which is literally right around the corner, but the thought of having to move the car and find a new spot every two hours was a big factor."

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic, early 1900’s building wonderfully renovated with contemporary appliances & interior aesthetics. We loved the proximity of the museums, restaurants & great bars. I was disappointed to find that the “parking on premises“ amenity was not a designated lot but refers to street parking which was available for free but in 2 hour segments during the weekday. Several attempts to clarify this misunderstanding through texts before I got there didn’t help explain the situation. Kristin acted to resolve the problem the next day, however, and we had a great time."

Unfortunately with covid many places are closed but Sprinkle Cone is open every day! And some restaurants are available for takeout"

Stayed a few nights","The apartment has a great view of Jamestown! Our pup loved looking out the ceiling to floor windows at everyone walking by on the sidewalk. Great spot for walking around the downtown area and river walk. Convenient area to drive to hiking spots within a half hour. The mattress was super comfortable in the room we slept in.
The parking situation is 2 hour street parking during business hours, we were able to park on the street overnight without being ticketed but the signs do say ""No Standing"" between 2:00am and 7:00am, seems that the city doesn't enforce either of the rules from what we saw. There was a meter lot across the side street and a parking garage a block down, not sure what the situation was for either overnight. There is no actual ""Free parking on premises"" as stated in the listing so may just need to look into those other off-street parking options if that is a concern for you."

She was quick to respond when we spoke and I felt safe in the 3rd floor apartment. I will definitely stay here again.
