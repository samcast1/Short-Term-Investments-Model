Stayed with a pet","The only complaint I had about this house is out of Dina’s control. The street is not busy at all, but many of the people who do drive by seem to think the 30mph speed limit is a challenge to go as fast as they can. If you stay here with pets or small children, be sure to have positive control of them when they are outside. Otherwise, it is a great house, convenient location, and a great value."

The Christmas decor in the interior made for a nice and cozy holiday setting…. We appreciate the thoughtfulness… if you’re looking for a quiet place to stay with a country feeling, I would recommend this property…"

The photos don’t do this place justice. It was so peaceful and quiet. We loved sitting around the fire and just enjoy each other.
The instructions were so helpful and very easy to follow. David was great at communicating and answering all our questions.

Stayed a few nights","My guy and I were looking for a nice peaceful place to relax, recharge, and enjoy other each before the holidays and David's place nailed it by exceeding our expectations. Day 1 it was super easy to find the house. Very clear instructions about checking in. The house had everything we needed. My guy loves football and he was able to get all his games on the tv. No wifi issues at all. The lake was so peaceful that every morning I spent time on the porch listening to nature sounds and watching the birds. And lastly everywhere we went the town's people were so friendly and nice. Thank you David and wife for creating such a loving, welcoming, and magical place away from the fast city life, it was just what we needed."

The instructions were clear on how to find the place and get in. The place was fully stocked with everything you need including lots of extra pillows and blankets and also had hot chocolate, things for s’mores, and everything you’d need to start a fire. It was very cutely decorated for Christmas which was a bonus! The host checked on us throughout our stay and was very friendly. It was a very peaceful place to stay and just far enough enough away from the city for some peace and quiet. If we ever visit hot springs, we will definitely be back!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved staying at David's Lake house. We are thinking about
booking again in the fall. The view was gorgeous even on a rainy day. We loved the deck and the outdoor living space. My grown kids joined us for the week, along with my sister, who visited during days from Little Rock. There was plenty of room for all 5 of us and our two medium-sized fur babies. We had a lot of fun on the lake using David's kayaks and fishing from the swimming deck. The yard is flat and very large. The dogs had room to roam & go for walks around the property. This is very hard to find at other homes on the lake in Hot Springs. The home was clean, roomy, and had everything you may need. David had added some really cute touches, and it was very nicely decorated. You will not be disappointed. We didn't have time to enjoy his fire pit, (even though he left us the makings of Smors' which we made in the microwave) but hopefully, we can if we get to book in the fall."

The host was amazing with communication and insuring we felt at home during our stay! We will be back very soon!

Stayed with kids","We decided on a spring break trip to Hot Springs and wanted to be near the water, but away from all the crowds. David's place is super quiet and right on the water. Our stay exceeded our expectations!
The house had plenty of room for our 3 boys (14 yo, 12 yo, 9 yo), my wife and I. The kids rooms were on one side of the house and the master was on the other side, so we were able to sleep-in. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals. There is a coffee pot/K-cup combo machine with coffee and filters provided. Consider bringing more if you are a big coffee drinker. Great internet with smart TV in the living room made for great movie nights.
Our favorite part of this house was the outdoor patio overlooking the lake and the massive fire pit. David provides plenty of firewood and enough s'mores for one night, so bring some extra if you love s'mores like we do. There are 4 kayaks and 1 stand-up paddle board to use. The lake is very calm so paddling was easy."

The house was spotless, beautiful inside and out. The water level was down. So it was like having your own private beach spot. Our fur babies loved it,
they hardly ever wanted to come inside. David and Linda are great hosts. And it shows, they want to make sure you are taken care of, and we felt right at home. We are already planning our 2nd stay, when the water level is up. Should be even more of a beautiful view, from the awesome deck!"

This place was the perfect distance away from town yet still so accessible. Check in was so easy, everything was impeccably clean, and the view is beautiful.
One of the first things I noticed was walking into the bathroom when we arrived I could literally smell the freshness of the towels. This is huge coming off of a road trip!
The bed was the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in, the washer and dryer were so easy to use and efficient, and the kitchen equipped with everything we needed.
It’s listed as a tiny home but the use of space makes it feel so spacious and comfortable. Daniel was also so responsive and helpful from check in to check out.
Wonderful place to stay - highly, highly recommend!"

Short drive to Hot Springs which has the nicest easy shaded trails - Falls Creek Falls, Lake Catherine State Park, Tufla Falls.

We will be back for a longer stay this year. They both came and met us and had a sweet treat for us to celebrate retirement. It was a super sweet gesture. We loved sitting around the campfire, as well as spoiling the horses . We highly recommend this hidden gem."

Stayed with a pet","This was our first ever Airbnb stay and it far exceeded all my expectations!! The house was beautiful, the beds were so comfortable I wanted to take them home!! Joanne is so incredibly sweet and accommodating!! It was so peaceful and so fun to watch the horses. They had the best toiletries and even had snacks, water in the fridge, and an assortment of coffees to choose from. We were able to stay here on our long road trip and bring our puppy dogs. This was supposed to be just a stop and a place to lay our heads so we wouldn’t have to camp with the dogs, but I want to go back just to stay and be able to enjoy it. It would be an amazing vacation. I can’t wait to go back!!"

Since this was also pet friendly, it made my stay so much better. It was very comfortable for my dogs and worked perfectly for what I needed. I do want to mention that the horses on the property are very close to this house. So, if you have reactive or scared dogs, that may factor in... But wasn't an issue at all for my two pups.
The hosts were absolutely wonderful, kind, and helpful. They gave very clear instructions and answered all my questions. I will absolutely be booking this home again!"

The scenery made me want to not go visit family but instead stay and take it all in. The quiet, the privacy, the cleanliness, the nature, the decor and wise use of space is beyond the limited 5 stars. In my opinion I believe this setting and all the details should be ""the example"" for all others to follow. I had a previous rule as to visit places only one time as to experience much in my travel, however due to my experience this will be the ""go to"" when I'm in this area to visit family. Thank you both, pleasure to have visited with you!"

This place is amazing. The surroundings are gorgeous. Theres a pond near the house and there's a space with chairs and overhead lights which makes this very festive and romantic. Theres another setting inna different area with 2 chairs where you can burn a fire.
The house is immaculate and charming. Tho we brought our own linens, the bed was dressed beautifully.
Joanne had set some snacks on the table which we greatly appreciated.
You are going to love this get away Jewel. Its in a vey private area.
The bed was comfortable and towels were in good supply.

The place is a free standing tiny home with full size appliances, comfortable bed, clean bathroom and cozy living area. If you stay here, do not miss the chance to stargaze away from big city lights and surrounded by nature!

Joanne and her husband are so welcoming, and accommodated my last minute reservation without issue. They gave clear instructions on where to go, and I felt safe, comfortable, and at home. I had my dog along and he was completely as ease as well. Completely recommend this little gem of a place."

Stayed with a pet","Super Nice!! I loved Blue Heron - everything about it was comfortable, cozy, welcoming and clean. Since it is tucked away in a corner of a large equestrian facility I had the best of two worlds - a feeling of privacy and also terrific views of horse pastures and the pond. There is another tiny house next door but they are well spaced apart and a fence with nice landscaping kept each place private without restricting spaciousness. The hosts were excellent - Joanne even called me the morning of my arrival to give me more specific instructions on finding the little house once I arrived at their property. That was most welcome since it was raining and not obvious where I should go. The outdoor space close to the little house was delightful with bistro lights in the trees, a barbecue, nice sitting areas and a fire pit by the pond. I could easily spend a few days there. Inside the house as I said was clean and cozy - everything was brand new feeling and tastefully done. I highly recommend!!"

The grounds are awesome, there are horses everywhere, friendly dogs and very friendly people. Joanne, Steve and Jen were all super responsive and VERY accommodating to the smallest request we had. If you ever want to stay at a place with Superior people and an amazing Tiny House, this should be at the top of your list. The Tiny house has more room than some apartments I have lived in and much more serene than any hotel I have ever been in. I can’t say enough about how we were treated and how great the Blue Heron is!"

The owners & barn manager seemed shocked but I found roach defogger under the kitchen sink which told me it wasn’t the first time.

The bed had a super comfy mattress and soft, immaculately clean linens. There was plenty of room for us two adults and our two dogs. We had a blast hanging out on the front porch, exploring the acreage, walking around the pond and visiting the horses. We can't wait to come back and fish in the pond and hang out by the firepit!"

The fridge is stocked, the bar is stocked, the coffee bar is ready for your creation. There was a variety of snacks, chocolates, cheese and crackers, chips, paper goods, and toiletries too! There are even robes in the closet. Mark knows those little extras really make his guests feel special. If I had one suggestion that I would have liked to have on hand, it would be a foldable suitcase holder.
The area it is located in feels peaceful and secluded next to a beautiful state park. We didnt use the pass to the resort, but did go just down the road to Catherine Lake Beach and float around some. It was such a pretty area.
Thanks for a great stay! If we need this location again, we would happily book again."

Stayed one night","Wow! Mark's Airbnb blew us away. His hospitality was extraordinary !!!!! The place is very clean and in a quite, peaceful area. Other reviews are spot on, he literally does have you covered on everything from toiletries to snacks to games!! Yes, everything! The place is decorated beautifully and is very comfortable. The HUGE towels were a nice touch and oh so comfy! We had planned to eat out several times but he had us covered on that as well...I mean who fully stocks an Airbnb's with breakfast, fruit, coffee bar, drinks, TONS of chocolate, and so many other things?!?!!!?? Mark's communication/directions were very prompt and easy to understand. I can definitely see why others would book his Airbnb again and again because we plan to!!!
I have already recommended his place to many who have asked as I posted pics info about it. Again, thank you for offering this nice place at a very affordable price, but also for all the added extras that other Airbnb's never think about.. . it's truly in the small details that make your place really stand out."

This place has reg snacks, drinks snacks + multi-flavored coffee’s, and a choice selection of chocolates!
This place is over the top for the budgeting traveler, lol - definitely a great stay, gracious host (Mark), wonderful amenities and very clean.

excellent value...already booked 2 more dates to return and stay for the wkend. can't wait :-)
i've stayed at a LOT of airbnb's but none have been so well stocked and every single thing been so carefully considered. it's a 20 min ride to hot springs downtown and magic springs but he also includes pool access to the golf and country club resort across the street."

Plenty of room to cook dinner and lounge, the bed was SO comfortable. Everything was clean, kitchen was well appointed, and the laundry facilities were great to have. Joanne was very helpful in getting to her place and knowledgeable about the restaurants and things to do in the area. Big white farm dog was a hoot, very friendly and visited us on the porch from time to time. There are so many horses, y’all, and they are awesome to interact with and observe. If you’re even remotely interested in horse stuff, book it. Would absolutely recommend, hope to stay again when we pass through."

Stayed one night","My recommendation: Arrive before dark, if possible, so you can see where you are. It’s a very nice horse farm with a friendly dog and horses who walk over (while still behind the fence) to see what’s going on. One stuck around and watched me load my car. The little house sits adjacent to all these goings on.
Host Joanne was excellent in giving good instructions since I would be arriving after dark and, being a horse farm, there is a brief rocky road. She was responsive by text too. The house was clean, fresh, inviting. Good TV with satellite. Spotless bathroom and kitchen. Finally, the bed had the best mattress I’ve had anywhere and with upscale blankets, etc. It’s a nice retreat."

It felt more like we were seeing family rather than staying in an Airbnb. When we arrived, Missy and Michael had a fire going in the fire pit and we got to hear some of their amazing stories. When they heard it was going to be my mom’s birthday, they did not hesitate to give her a bottle of Prosecco as a gift. The guesthouse is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, and they have thought of everything one might need during their stay here. There was lots of wildlife to watch, and the view of the Ouachita river is spectacular. We got to use their hot tub (words can’t express how fantastic it was) and their sweet cat Tilly came to visit us. I also used the jacuzzi bathtub and became a bath person. The best part of all is that my mom said she had a relaxing weekend free from stress and anxiety. I highly recommend!!"

Stayed a few nights",Really a beautiful property and the host was so hospitable and sweet. I wish in the listing it would state that the hosts live in the house right next to the Airbnb. I figured it was on the same property but not that there was a bridge between the two. It was a non-issue but probably should be mentioned. The hot tub was really nice after a day of hiking around hot springs. We took the kayaks out too that was nice. It was just so beautiful and far enough away from town to be exactly the peaceful weekend we were hoping for. Would totally recommend to anyone that loves to get lost in the beauty of nature

Stayed a few nights","Missy & Michael's Treehouse is just perfect! It's honestly 1 of the best AirBnB's we've ever stayed in! They're 1 of the most kind, friendly, & accommodating hosts we've come across & their pets are sweet too! They're truly good people, so don't be afraid to get to know them a bit while you're here! They've provided great amenities! There's amazing bathroom supplies, a wide array of great kitchen tools, firewood, & just ask if there's anything you need! This treehouse has a super comfy bed, awesome shower/tub, great wifi, & amazing outdoor views & fun! We grilled, played horseshoes, sat around the fire, roasted marshmallows, star gazed, & enjoyed the hot tub! There's nothing like enjoying your morning coffee or evening beer while in a hot tub 10 feet away from a river & beautiful scenery! It's such a peaceful, relaxing place to recharge & I can't recommend this wonderful place enough! We'll definitely be back next year! Thank you for sharing your beautiful place w/ us! See ya'll soon!"

Always concerned I was enjoying my stay! I can without a doubt state that this stay was was the most enjoyable stay I have ever had not only because of the stunning views but mainly because of these fabulous host!! Now, the property was terrific, serene & beautiful! Drinking morning coffee on the deck while watching the river flow, the hummingbirds come to the feeder, the deer enjoying corn in the front yard & just all of the beautiful nature that God created was simply breathtaking! I wish I had more time there to to enjoy it all but I can assure you that I will return! I have friends that are planning trips here based off of our conversations & pictures I sent to them. You will not be disappointed at the treehouse!! I can assure you of that!! Very highly, highly, highly recommended!!!"

Just those two made it worth the trip and that's not mentioning the resort style accomodations/ activities they provide. My 4 year old daughter hasn't stopped talking about the hot tub over looking the river, bubble bath in the Jacuzzi, fishing off the bank of the river, and "" her"" Crockett!!!! She was upset that we ran out of time to do any kayaking..:( We stayed for just the weekend ...and let me tell you... that is not enough time. Absolutely amazing!!!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","I was working in the area and needed a place to stay for a few days while my RV was repaired. This place wildly exceeded my expectations. It is close to town but somewhat off the beaten path. I was working from sun up to sun down so I did not get to enjoy the river or the hot tub, but the peaceful location and nicely appointed apartment made for an enjoyable stay. The hosts are great. They are friendly and attentive but not intrusive. If you need lodging in Arkadelphia this place should be your first choice....I think it would make for a nice romantic getaway that won't break the bank"

It was my mother's 60 birthday and this was my gift for her and when we arrived at the Treehouse, there was a beautiful birthday cake waiting for her when we arrived. That was the nicest hottub I had ever been in and the outside kitchen was awesome. We enjoyed every minute of it , oh and the bathroom in the tree house is to die for. Everything was well above any expectation. Honestly the Best Air B n B I've been to yet ! I will definitely be back , we are already checking dates to see when we can come back. You won't find a nicer host any where!!! Thank you so very much for making our time with you amazing 😍😍😍"

Stayed with a pet","This place was in a picturesque setting that we did not actually see until the next morning. It was pouring rain, and we arrived pretty late. When we did wake up and see that we were surrounded by a forest, it was spectacular. The place was very clean and accommodated us and the dogs very well. The larger bed was pretty comfy. The only thing that was a bit difficult was navigating the streets as they are one way most of the way, but don't have clear markings to indicate which street goes which way. We also drove past the house a few times as it's not well-lit and is surrounded by trees. The house number is on the mailbox, but it is very faded. Other than that, we loved the place, and it felt very cozy. Jana was also very responsive and helpful, despite our struggles to locate everything."

The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, including coffee, creamer and sugar (which was a first for us). The bedrooms are super comfortable and I slept better than I have in a while. You can find most restaurants and amenities within 15 minutes of the cottage, but it’s located in a beautiful private setting. Being able to hear the small nearby waterfall from the front porch was an awesome bonus during morning coffee! Janine was responsive and so easy to deal with.
We airbnb frequently. This is one of the best experiences we’ve had (and almost all of them have been good).
I strongly recommend Grace Point if you’re in the area! We will stay here again when we come back this way!"

Upon arriving the serene sound of the water from the creek caught my attention. We sat on the front porch for a few minutes before going to bed just to listen to the water and the peace and quiet. The house was beautifully decorated and very cozy feeling. She has thought of everything and used the space so wisely. I only wish we could have stayed longer.

The kitchen had everything we needed and the bathroom was very clean. On our last night there was a thunderstorm and the rain falling on the metal roof put me right to sleep. I’ve stayed at close to 40 Airbnbs in the past 10 years and this one is definitely one of my favorites. They had thought of several small touches that made the place feel right at home. Including a tiny sewing kit that came in handy when my son lost a button on his shirt. THIS is what Airbnb used to be. I’m very thankful that they shared their place and hope they decide to continue to do so. I would 1000% recommend them."

Initially we were just going to attend the wedding and make the hour plus drive home afterwards but with the forecast of yucky weather we decided to search for a place to stay. I came across Bednara Farms and sent a message to the manager asking how far it would be to the wedding location. She replied quickly and the drive was just short of 6 miles. They approved up for an early arrival of 2pm which was great so that we could get ready. Bed was super comfy, everything was clean and tidy. The outdoor wrap around patio was beautiful….I can only imagine how pretty everything is outside on a nice day. If we visit this area again we will be back with our kiddos. They would absolutely love the little cabin!"

Stayed with kids","Our second stay at Bednara was as great as our first. Took a day trip to Little Rock and another to Petite Jean State Park, but the rest of the time was filled lounging around the cabin or down by the creek. It’s very relaxed and peaceful there. The kids could have spent another week hanging in loft or on the porch. We took an evening stroll most nights to watch all the fireflies. Jillian was very responsive and helpful just as before. No regrets in going back and I’m sure trip 3 will be in the future."

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect for a weekend getaway to relax and unplug! The scenery was beautiful - had the feeling of being out in the woods but wasn't far from the main highway. The creek/river was beautiful!
The upstairs loft is too small for adults to use. We thought that one of us would sleep in the loft but the ceiling was way too low and it would have been dangerous to get up during the night between the low ceilings and the stairs. The loft also made the bathroom and kitchen below it have very low ceilings. The shower head was too low for me to use normally (I'm 5' 8"").
The driveway was steep and a bit washed out from the rain before/during our stay. My AWD vehicle was fine, but a smaller vehicle may have had trouble.
This place is definitely perfect for a little getaway. Bed was comfy, couch was spacious and comfortable, all appliances worked great. The outdoor swinging daybed was awesome! Overall a good stay!"

We made several meals and soooo many memories. Cell service wasn’t an issue at all. I work remotely so I was nervous about it, but there were no issues. We are all 6ft or taller except our two little ones but that didn’t bother us in the spaces w/the low ceilings. We managed and wasn’t a big deal. Sure am glad we had my 4x4 to get up the hill when adventuring to Hot Springs. Ground was very soft from the AMAZING thunderstorm the night before and not sure we would’ve made it out. Dogs had they time of their little doggy lives running around! We hiked all around and explored. Definitely make a day trip (or two, we did!) to Hot springs & to the crystal mining! My hubby zip-lined a million times and kiddos enjoyed finding their own crystals. Would love to come back in summer."

(We drive a Subaru Impreza and used caution when getting down the steep rocky drive.) The cabin is very cute with basic amenities and a full kitchen. Minor details (tissues, access to internet, extra hand towels) were missing, but the listing notes the lack of internet access. The bathroom is not height friendly. If this is a make it or break it point this isn't the place for you. My fiancé is 6'1"" and had to duck in the space. I, 5""7', had to crouch under the shower head to get everything wet. Hot water and other plumbing were great! Overall, the space is cozy and easy to feel at home in. We enjoyed our 4 night stay. Host is SUPER responsive and sweet! :)"

For small children, be careful as the loft and porch are a bit of a fall risk.
For taller men, be aware that the ceiling height in the kitchen, bathroom, and loft are very low. My husband couldn’t stand up all the way in the shower. I am 5’5” and bumped my head going into the loft with my children. The loft is low enough that really only middle/older children under 5 ft are fit for the space.
Overall we enjoyed our stay."

The Farm itself had tons to do. We spent a part of everyday at the swimming hole where the kids enjoyed feeding the fish, swimming, skipping rocks, and exploring. We took several hikes and completed (mostly) the scavenger hunt. The kids were very excited to find Bigfoot.
The Cabin was perfect for a weeklong getaway. Cozy and comfortable, we spent many days hanging around on the pose home and making s’mores.
The location was continent to travel to but remote enough to get away. We even took an easy day trip to Little Rock with no traffic or headaches on the way.
We highly recommend Bednara Farms and hope to go back one day ourselves."

We would absolutely recommend this for anyone trying to check out and find some quite while having space for all kinds of activities. The hosts are amazing and responsive. A beautiful setting in the hills of Arkansas and close enough to Hot Springs or Little Rock you can still find plenty to do.

The fire pit and grill as well as multiple outdoor seating areas made for the perfect place to enjoy the quiet wooded area. It was easily accessible from the interstate but shielded from noise. The kitchen was well stocked and we had everything we needed for meals in."

The porch swing was amazing at night and all day. Had the blessing to seeing an owl. House was clean and everything was provided. Smelled really good. I would rate this a 10. If you just want to get a way for a few days with no one around this is the place to be.

Perfectly secluded away from the hustle and bustle but just a quick 30 minute drive to Little Rock and Hot Springs. Our family of 4 had the best time at Jillian's cabin and it will for sure be something our kids remember forever. The swimming hole is beautiful and the porch is where you will find yourself spending all your time. We enjoyed 4 cozy nights just being disconnected and playing games. Our 2 & 4 year old loved the loft and felt very special that they had their own space. They are already asking when we are going back!"

Everything was spotlessly clean. Pulling up to the house we started to question our decision (some of the neighbor's homes are a little rough) but once we pulled into the secluded driveway we felt very at ease. The property is VERY private and backs up to a beautiful lake. There is a huge outdoor deck and a fishing pier on the lake. The home is very spacious and very comfortable. This is a great place to rest and relax. The beds were all extremely comfortable! The Wi-Fi was a little bit hit or miss but I think that's just the nature of satellite internet. Overall, this was the perfect place for our family, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable, quiet and peaceful stay!"

Seems like a newer listing so could benefit from more robust kitchen utensils and amenities. Wifi is spotty with very slow streaming of Netflix shows; this wifi would not work well for someone trying to work remotely. We suggest guests download movies before arrival.

Setup was perfect for our stay - kids stayed in the side bedrooms and parents used the bigger ones.
Kitchen/dining room/living room was very spacious and inviting. (Only issue was there weren't any window coverings in the living area, only bedrooms.)
TV was nice, a little lag when using the remote and the wifi is pretty slow. But, nothing you can't deal with.
Only thing I wished I knew beforehand was the ""neighborhood"" was a little sketchy/questionable. But, once you got down to the property, it was secluded and very nice. Super quiet!
We had a minor issue with the master lock when trying to check in. But, was definitely USER ERROR. Lol. I text the host and she responded immediately. After her quick instruction, we were in! I was thankful for the very fast response.
Covered parking was also nice!
Shampoo, conditioner, body wash... All in the shower.

Kimberly accommodated us by adding additional people to our reservation. The downstairs worked well for 6 to eat at the table. Tempurepedic bedding nice! nice price, close to Hot Spring!,AC worked well! Just note that the grill is ready for charcoal only. Bring OFF spray for sitting outdoors and for people over 55 the indoor and outdoor stairs should be considered (luggage, ice chest). Kimberly opened the lower doors for us. She is super responsive with requests! The total solar eclipse was an awesome experience one that we will not forget! Thanks for sharing your space!"

We didn’t utilize the game room downstairs because we were away most of the weekend, but it’s a cool bonus. The bed was pretty comfortable and we loved the reclining chair in the living room. Only a couple of things that I’ll mention… the shower is very small and there are lots of steps, which can be scary when arriving after dark, so be sure you have a flashlight! The hosts do provide some flashlights that we were able to use. Overall great stay!! Would recommend to anyone visiting the area!"

I highly recommend this place for any family or couple that wants a homey place to land but close to all the shops and restaurants the city has to offer. It’s not far from Lake Catherine or GWG and those were two places we went to, as well. It was so peaceful for us and we truly enjoyed the experience.

Stayed with kids","The house was absolutely perfect for our little family. We have 2 boys (5 & 2) that are used to spending a lot of time outdoors, so a backyard was a must, and this one did not disappoint. My husband even borrowed a leaf blower from the friendly neighbors to make them a pile to jump in. The house is minutes from Garvan Gardens which was a must see for us. It also wasn’t far from Bathhouse Rowe and restaurants. The house had everything we needed to cook and grill. There were even sheets for a pack-n-play which was unexpected but appreciated since we forgot ours. There were plenty of towels and extra blankets. It was a great little pre-holiday trip."

Stayed with a pet",Tara’s rental is a very nice home. Exceptionally clean. It is located a few minutes drive to Hot Springs National Park and Garvan Woodlands. I have already recommended this house to another family we know planning to visit the area. There is no hesitation awarding this home 5 stars.

Stayed with kids",Tara's place was incredibly close to Garven Gardens and a short drive to other Hot Springs attractions. We had no problem finding the house or getting in. The home was clean and comfortable. The backyard and fire pit looked nice but we didn't get to enjoy it due to rain during our stay. Would recommend to anyone traveling to the Hot Springs area.

Stayed a few nights","The house looked good plenty of space and nice yard. The cleaner that was used had an over powering clinical smell, not pleasant at all. We finally had to purchase a mop and bucket to go over all the floors and purchase a fragrance plug in to minimize the smell.
Also there were only 4 large towels for 4 people the rest of the towels
were very small. One last disappointment, the floors felt odd, kind of soft. It would have made us feel safer if there had been deadbolts on the doors.
Quiet area and close to Hot Springs downtown."

Stayed with kids",The neighbor hood is very quiet. My Family enjoyed the quiet. It was farther out from town than I originally thought. There was a dollar general about a mile away so that got you out of a bind. The beds was very comfortable. The house was smaller than we expected but it worked for our family. If anyone in the family is handicap the doors aren’t wide enough for wheel chairs but that was my fault for not asking. The back yard was huge and fenced in. But it was so hot during our stay we didn’t get to use it. There is a grill and a hammock. We got to see some deer in the yard our last day there. The house needs a couple things maintenance wise but simple. but over all it’s a nice clean quiet house to stay. If you don’t mind a15 minute drive into Hot springs. I appreciate Tara hosting us. We had a great family time for my grandmothers 84 birthday.

This time we met for family discussions. The place was so clean and restful. It was a big thrill to all of us to be able to see a family get out in the back yard and just rest. Her snacks saved our first day. Their kitchen was well stocked with all items needed to make meals. We are hoping to go back.

Plus, she left water out for us as well as a few snacks. Also, this seems like a small detail, but the covered driveway space came in clutch the morning we left. It was pouring rain, and we were luckily able to pack up the car without getting soaked. If you’re in the area, this home is a wonderful stay away from the bustle of town yet perfectly close to all the action. Thanks, Tara!"

Stayed with a pet","Beautifully remodeled and so clean. Our three dogs had plenty of space and enjoyed the backyard and deck.
The kitchen was the most stocked of any airbnb we have stayed in. Several glasses, mixing bowls, tupperware and pans. Some of the pans are a worn out, but they got the job done. The kitchen island made us a bit nervous. It was nice to have something there to set a few drinks or chips on, but we worried about the sturdiness of it. I'd recommend a butcher's block table or something more substantial.
Showers were AHHHHMAZING. Fantastic water pressure and shower heads were so wonderful. Only weird quirk in the bathrooms were the size of the bath towels. They were more like a large hand towel? We almost bought larger ones.
The beds were VERY firm with non-supportive pillows, so that would be something to consider with your stay. Two nights on them was okay but a third night and we would've been sore.
Overall, wonderful house that we would return to! Responsive owners and clean!"

The location is great, it was only about 13 minutes from the Hot Springs National Park which we stopped at as well. It is near a lot of restaurants or Kroger for groceries. The house itself is so adorable, I love the way they have decorated the house (very minimal so it doesn’t feel cluttered). I am a neat freak so I was very happy that the house was very clean. Lots of towels, pots and pans to use, washing machine, coffee with a cute little coffee bar area, and she even left us some snacks and water :). The bed and sheets were very comfortable as well. Finally the yard was so nice and big, fenced in, and was very much appreciated by my dogs. I really liked this place and would most definitely stay here again."

Group trip","This is a great, cozy home! My family and I enjoyed staying here for Thanksgiving weekend with all of the amenities available. The house is in a quite neighborhood and relatively close to downtown Hot Springs! The host was great with communication and accommodations. The house was clean and she provided everything we needed to cook and have a good time. The backyard was perfect for our dogs to play in!"

Stayed with a pet","This was the perfect place for our young family. Far enough away from downtown to have some peace and quiet but close enough for it not take too long to get anywhere. We had a great time playing board games and making s’mores with the fire pit. Tara communicated very well, the home was spotless and she even provided a pack n play for our young infant. We will definitely be coming back next time we are in Hot Springs!"

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay. The owner communicated with us very well. The home was very clean and well-furnished. We didn’t need anything, everything was thought of. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet",This place was an amazing stay! So clean and had everything you pretty much needed. Tara was very responsive and helpful even check how everything was mid week! Easy and clear instruction for checkin. I definitely recommend this is and great place to stay would stay again when back on Hot springs! And everything isn’t too far located right down the road from Garvan woodlands Gardens!
