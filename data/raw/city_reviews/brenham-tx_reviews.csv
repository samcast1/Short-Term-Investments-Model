Stayed a few nights","Perhaps the “best” air bnb we’ve ever seen! The house was immaculate with so many details so well thought out. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking, even small snacks on the counter and ice cream in the freezer. There were toiletries in the bathroom in case we had forgotten something, etc.! We would definitely stay here again should our travels take us back to Brenham!"

The interior was not only beautiful but Sharon thought of everything, there was nothing that we needed that she didn’t think of. Book this Airbnb, you will not want to leave I promise you. Also, we never drove our cars, everything was walkable. 🌸"

Easy drive, downtown Brenham is darling, and Sharon’s house is BEAUTIFUL! We loved staying there. Clean, updated, quiet, and Sharon’s sweet gestures were the perfect touch; ice cream in the fridge, the extras of toothpaste, mouthwash, etc.
We will be staying again! Such an amazing host"

Plus, all the added touches from the Christmas decorations and Cookies to the nice touch of having so many necessities in the kitchen that we didn't have to go purchase, from aluminum foil to spices and coffee creamers to ice cream! My Mom and I stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed being there the whole time! Location is great for getting around town and decorated so beautifully! We look forward to staying there again when we come back to visit family! Thank you so much Sharon! :-)"

Stayed about a week","Our stay at Lolly and Pop’s exceeded expectations. Not only did the house exactly match the photos, you had a sense of coziness that no photos can convey. Sharon thought of all the little details that you wish all Airbnbs did; labeled light switches, sticky notes in a drawer, little snacks and a variety of coffees, homemade cookies from a local bakery with my business logo (made me tear up) and countless other details that made our stay so special. The proximity to the quaint downtown was an added bonus. I even got a great nail salon recommendation! Can’t wait to stay again!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow. This is the best rental we’ve ever had. We felt so safe, clean and taken care of. Sharon has created the most cozy, inviting and charming home and we genuinely felt like we were in our own home. The linens and towels were amazing and even the throw blankets smelled freshly washed… thank you so much for that. It was so nice to snuggle up with them outside and on the couch. We almost canceled dinner reservations one evening because we didn’t want to leave the backyard. Thank you for all of the little treats, it made us all feel beyond welcomed after a long day of shopping. Shout out to Brossa’s Italian. Wonderful food and service and the best part was we could walk there and back since it was just two buildings away from the house. Sharon- thanks again. We cannot wait to make this home our new girls getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","The house is lovely, immaculate and well appointed. It has a great private outdoor area with good parking. Indoor finishes were up to date and tasteful. The reason for the lower rating for “location” although still good is we didn’t do anything in Brenham. We rented the house to visit around Top TX so we are unable to provide feedback on things in close proximity to the house when asked about “location”. That said, the house is located on a fairly busy road and there is road noise. The view across the street is not ideal. However I would definitely rent again and recommend to others. Thank you for the sweet treats, coffee and water! We enjoyed our stay tremendously."

Every detail imaginable was taken care of, including the cutest cookies and ice cream upon arrival. We really felt at home! We could come back from our wanderings late in the afternoon and be perfectly content to stay in, cook snack play games watch TV and nap! The decor inside and out was adorable. My daughter paced off the square footage because she loved the layout so much!

Amenities over the top! Extra details, like greeting us with bottled water in the refrigerator, snacks and special cookies made from the local bakery. The kitchen was a chef's dream! The linens were high quality and beds so comfortable. Technology was state-of-art. Everything was high end! The host clearly thinks of every possible need to please the guest. We felt like we were guests in a ""Fixer/Upper"" episode reveal on the Magnolia network. LOL. Just a few steps away is a charming little town filled with fun stores, restaurants and bars.

Stayed with kids","My family had a wonderful time here. From the moment we drove up and saw the string lights at night, until we left, we felt at home. Sharon was extremely responsive and is a wonderful host. The home was very charming and relaxing. Quite Frankly, the home should be in a magazine because they remodeled so well, and you can feel the love and appreciation put in, in the home. The beds were super comfy and the bathrooms are really nice. Same with the kitchen with the huge island and rectangular basin sink, living, and patio area. There is also a huge area for parking or playing games. There was also a grill available to us. There is a washer/dryer and they are quality appliances, as we used them. Back to Sharon, she really spoiled us with treats. From Blue Bell to little Cutie Pie’s, from Coffee to Sports drinks, we loved it all :) This home should be visited anytime you are in Brenham or in the surrounding area! We will definitely book again!"

Stayed a few nights","This beautiful home was by far the BEST vacation home I've stayed in! From the moment I pulled into the driveway I knew this place was special! It may seen like a small thing, but what first impressed me was the large ""turn-around"" area in the back of the home which allowed for turning my car around and leaving the driveway ""head-first"" instead of backing out on a main road. (This has been an issue for me in many vacation homes I've stayed at.) When I walked through the back door I was met with a huge country kitchen! The large island had cookies and pies waiting along with a sweet note from the owner. The cabinets and drawers were stocked with any dish/utensil you could possibly need. There were water bottles in the refrigerator and quarts of Blue Bell ice cream in the freezer! The large dining table could fit a family of six easily! A cozy couch and love seat were in the living room, and was a perfect ""winding-down"" area after a long day at Round Top! The two bedrooms were large and the beds were very comfortable. The master bath had a huge shower, double sinks and ample towels and washcloths (which were amazingly soft). The second bathroom was only steps away from the second bedroom. It, too, was roomy and had more than enough towels. The owner, Sharon, was very friendly, easy to reach and so accommodating! This home definitely exceeded my expectations! I was a bit sad to leave and I will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Really perfect. We kept finding more amenities and details throughout our weekend stay. This was one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. This property is worth planning a trip to Brenham for even if you have no other reason to go there. Location was amazing to quickly walk to downtown Old Brenham which had enough options to spend a great half day shopping and we ate at a different restaurant for each meal and found multiple venues with live music.
House was impeccably done. Communication with host was great. Amenities thoughtful and aplenty. Truly well done.
We are convinced that “Sharon” is just the alias Joanna Gaines is using to manage this property on the sly lol."

The proximity to downtown made it so easy to walk back and forth to all of our favorite local spots. The house is truly a gem! Every detail was attended to - beautiful decor, high-end finishes, luxurious bedding, and so many personal touches. Sharon left us a lovely assortment of snacks - including pies from the famous Royer's in Round Top and Blue Bell Ice Cream in the freezer! We felt so at home and comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed coffee in the morning and cocktails in the evening in the little courtyard - such a charming spot! Cannot say enough wonderful things and cannot wait to go back again! Thank you, Sharon!"

The location was great and walking distance to anything you want to do in downtown. We also went to Round Top for the day and the drive was easy and about 25 minutes.
There were only two of us on this trip but it would be very comfortable for 4. We highly recommend this place and will definitely book again when in the area!"

Newly renovated, each space is expertly designed and so cozy. We didn’t want to leave! Walking distance to so many great restaurants and shops in Brenham, and just a short drive to Round Top where we spent most of our time. We can’t wIt to come back!"

Brenham was a nice small town, and we are glad we took the time to visit. The only thing to note is that the host did not respond to a question that concerned our safety to the air bnb. The host responded only after the full cancelation deadline, and it wasn't even a response to my question; they never responded to my question. Overall, it was a great experience, and we are glad we didn't let poor communication ruin our trip."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place away from the bustle of the city and where you can enjoy peace and quiet, with a magnificent pool, this is it! The barndominium is outside the city of Brenham in rolling hills; there are neighbors (most in very posh homes) but they are far enough away where you have a sense of being in a secluded area. The lap pool is about 75-80 feet long, and perhaps the most well-constructed pool I have ever seen (the workmanship is really good). The screened porch is fully shaded in the morning and with a nice breeze it was very comfortable, even in 102 degree heat. It is less than 10 minutes to an HEB, Super Walmart, excellent restaurants. We drove one day to Round Top (15 minutes) to shop around and eat at Royer's (and took the renowned pecan pie back). The place sleeps seven easily, and with three full bathrooms, there is plenty of room. The house is spotless and well maintained. We will be coming back!"

The property is private and the home was as described. Marisol was very quick to respond to any questions and also sent messages to remind us of scheduled maintenance such as mowing/pool cleaning. We had groceries delivered through instacart, enjoyed the local movie theatre and restaurants, and took a trip to Houston to the visit the space museum.
The living room is smaller than most but there are tvs in both bedrooms and a nice screened in porch to enjoy time with family . The house was very clean and there were plenty of linens and extra items such as tp, soaps and trash bags.
You won’t be disappointed by this property!"

There were duplo blocks and train tracks for my granddaughter to play with. Everything was labeled clearly, including the light switches, which I truly appreciated! The bedrooms are spacious and who could pass up 3 full bathrooms while traveling with family?!? The back patio, fire pit and the grill make for a wonderful evening out of doors. The real bonus for me was the amount of wildlife on the property. We identified close to 50 species of birds! The wildflower meadows were full of beautiful Texas natives like Texas thistle, brown-eyed Susans, Indian blanket, and Rose-Gentians plus so many more. We also did some stargazing the first night and found both Venus and Mars plus several constellations.
If you are looking for some R&R and fresh air in a beautiful setting - do not hesitate to book the Cardinal Cottage!"

We absolutely loved the built in spa area and the screened in porch. We visited in January so we weren’t able to use the pool but it was amazing. Olympic size with a tanning ledge! The house was a short drive into Roundtop to enjoy the antique sale and restaurants. It would be wonderful for a family during the spring and fall show. The nonshoppers could relax by the pool while the others shopped:)) The WiFi is spotty so streaming upstairs was very difficult, but with the outside living area who wants to be inside.

Just be aware, the deepest part of the pool at the end is 9 feet deep and the highest part is 4ft 6 inch. which is somewhat deep for most kids so be sure you have swimming experience. However the cottage provides Swimming noodles and several lifejackets for your convenience. Overall something you will not regret staying!"

Just like the pics there’s a large enclosed screened porch, big fire pit, a large pool and hot tub. Unfortunately for us it was raining and cold so we didn’t get to use those amenities, but it makes for a reason to come back! 😊 This Airbnb is definitely meant for enjoying the great outdoors!"

Stayed with kids","Our family of 6 stayed 4 nights. We were hopeful that 80° weather would warm up the pool enough but it did not. We didn't get our hopes up too high it being December.The kids spent most of the time in the hot tub. They very much enjoyed it! The master bedroom mattress is very firm, I had no problem sleeping but my husband has a bad back and it was a bit uncomfortable for him. We spent a good amount of time cooking. We found all we needed in the kitchen. My only suggestion is bringing your Tupperware if you have an extended stay to store your leftovers. We ate most our meals on the porch enjoying the amazing weather! We did some site seeing. We highly recommend Brazos Valley Brewing. Family friendly and we had a great time listening to live music. Burton Short Stop also had amazing burgers. Overall, we had a pleasant restful time. We hope to stay again! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Stayed a few nights","Marisol was a great host and her place is perfectly placed between a couple small town Texas gems (Brenham and Round Top). We enjoyed our long weekend here exploring both towns and a couple local wineries. The food and service was top notch; everyone was so welcoming and friendly. We are not into antiques, but it looks like a haven for anyone that does!
We spent our downtime at the house enjoying the scenery from the hot tub. Three full baths with plenty of towels; dedicated towels for the pool and hot tub were a nice perk! The space and beds were all very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again, and recommend for anyone looking to get away for some quiet Texas charm!"

Stayed with kids","Here’s what we loved:
1. This property offers the best of both worlds - it is off the beaten path but also close enough to civilization that you can run out for groceries or necessities. It felt like a true get-away from the hustle and bustle.
2. Marisol is a fantastic host! She’s responsive and helpful.
3. The pool is the star of the show. It’s where we spent most of our time.
A few important notes when planning your trip:
1. The pool has a small splash pad that opens up to the main pool, and the depth of the main pool begins at 4.5’ then very quickly drops to 6’ and 9’. You’ll need to bring pool floats, even for adults, if you want to lounge in the main pool without treading water.
2. The living space in the house is small, so plan to spend most of your time outdoors.
3. TV service was spotty, so plan accordingly if, for instance, there’s a sports game you want to watch.
4. The kitchen has olive oil, salt, and pepper. You’ll need to bring any other spices or condiments with you."

The pool was refreshing during the hot summer days and surprisingly the evenings were cooled down enough for us to light the fire and make s'mores. Cardinal Cottage is a beyond well appointed barndominium - Marisol has so many things available in case you forget them at home. She checked in on us a couple of times to make sure we settled in well and to let us know she is available with any questions we may have had."

The pool was larger than I expected (2 full lanes) & deep (4.5 - 9ft). There were 2 large umbrellas in the pool area for shade (which I was worried about.) life jackets & pool towels available. The AC worked well and the house was cool during the hot summer days. I can’t think of ANYTHING the house is lacking - Marisol truly prepared & thought of everything you’ll need during your stay. Most certainly will be returning."

Not everyone offers those extra touches which makes your trip much easier. We really enjoyed the patio area. A nice breeze comes through making it very comfortable in the Texas heat. It was very peaceful. No city noise. Pool was great as well. Location worked well being under 10 minutes away from everything you need in Brenham. Marisol was great with communication and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend if you’re looking to visit the Brenham area or if you just want a weekend away."

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED our stay at Susan's!!
She really is a super host! We checked in late at night, so the keyless entry was very easy and convenient. Not only is her cottage beautifully decorated (we'd call it ""farmhouse chic""), charming, clean, and so comfortable, we were so impressed with her thoughtfulness in the details. From the super comfy beds, quality towels, and even the make up face towels and small packets of make up remover to delicious snacks and personal size Blue Bell ice cream in the freezer!! Kitchen was so well appointed with every cooking tool and dishes needed. The only thing missing were wine glasses but she did have champagne flutes which we happily used. Also liked looking at some vintage magazines displayed. We even enjoyed some games she provided, like playing cards and dominoes. We didnt get a chance to watch tv but she provides all the needed channels and even some dvds. We will definitely try to book this cottage again, on my next visit to Brenham. Thanks"

Stayed with kids","The place was very charming and nicely decorated . The beds were super comfortable and clean. I personally loved soaking in the old claw foot tub! Loved the finishes in every thing from tile to light fixtures. Although the house was clean with it being an older home I’m sure dust gets in so we noticed the floors seemed dirty. I wiped water up from bathroom floor and the towel was really dirty and the same with the hardwood floors which may not get moped every time. Also, seemed to be a lot of clutter in the closets that took up space we could have used. Need a little more light in the bath room with the tub and also the kitchen needs some track or can lighting. Did love and appreciate the motion sensor night lights throughout the interior. Blue Bell ice cream in the freezer was certainly a very nice surprise as were the snacks, drinks and wine. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend."

Stayed with a pet","Myself and a group of friends came to have a weekend getaway from Houston. I had stayed previously at the Craftsman Cottage and really loved it, so definitely wanted to book again. We all loved how nicely the home was set-up with conveniences such as charging stations, lovely snacks and wine (and Blue Bell Ice Cream!), super comfy beds, bathroom amenities and everything you could want. There are 3 spacious bedrooms--2 with really comfy kinds and one with two comfy twins, and two bathrooms. Five friends (could have fit 6 just fine) and a doggie stayed and all felt very comfy. Well appointed kitchen with counter space to prepare. We made a meal on our first night and had everything we needed to cook. Susan is an awesome host -- super communicative, quick to respond, accommodating and kind. Best air bnb experience I've had and I've had a pretty good amount. Also, lovely neighborhood, backyard, walkable to downtown (.7 miles). Will stay again for sure and recommend to the highest degree."

We were in town for the Round Top extravaganza, and the house was very convenient for that purpose (about 20 minute drive to Burton). The house was very clean, beds were incredibly comfy (also loved the pillows and linens), and we all noticed and appreciated the ""extras"" that Susan had provided (candies, mints, coffee pods, wine!, razors, bath bombs, lotion, detergent, paper towels, creamer, bottled water & soda, shampoo, ice cream!) I can't think of anything that we needed or might have wanted that Susan hadn't considered. My dog and I also appreciated the small fenced yard, which even had doggie poop bags and a garbage can provided. I forgot a few things after we left, and Susan promptly notified me and sent them along at my request. Very gracious host with great communication. Thank you so much for a lovely stay!"

The cleanliness of the home was impeccable. The beds were so comfortable and the linens were like being at home. Susan had such special extras throughout the home. The kitchen with treats, drinks and Blue Bell ice cream were a huge hit after a long drive. The restrooms with little extras, such as bath bombs and facial wipes, and hair/bath toiletries. All you need to bring to this Airbnb is your clothes. She has thought of everything. Thanks again for a wonderful stay and we will definitely give this Airbnb 5 Stars. Danny and Debbie Tullos"

Note to guests: all bedrooms are on one side of the house and the bathrooms on the other.

Additionally, there’s two bathrooms but only 1 shower. A claw foot tub is in the other bathroom."

The only slight negative of the place is that pulling out of the driveway takes an extra second or two to look due to the viewing angle on the road. If you are needing to stay near Brenham, it is unlikely you could do better than this spot."

All the comforts of home plus++++more to enjoy like-- sleep machines in each bedroom, a basket of throw blankets to get cozy, restaurant recommendations and Blue Bell in the freezer! We didn't go outside (it was February) to use the little patio, but other than that, we found every space comfortable and very livable. She has a great coffee/tea bar that is fully stocked with all kinds of teas, coffees, sweeteners, creamers, cute mugs all right there in the dining room, super easy to use and out of the way of the kitchen. The location of the house is great! Personally, I would not call it ""walking distance to town"", exactly because there are no sidewalks and we were always had a few stops, but some folks might walk it. The trip to Round Top is not to be missed- just 20-30 minutes away and all the activity on the square in Brenham is fun to explore. Go have fun!"

There was a Keurig and a traditional coffee pot, coffee, creamer, sugar, and the cutest gold spoons to stir with. The kitchen was ready for a home cooked meal in a brand new stove or leftovers heated in the microwave. The full-size fridge was very clean and had a filtered pitcher for water.

From the outside, the home looks very similar to the rest in the neighborhood (which was very quiet and lovely) but once we got inside.. wow! The decor is gorgeous with so many fun details around every room. Every space is thoughtfully laid out and well-equipped. It’s like they anticipated all our needs and wants and then made it super cute. We spent the first few minutes just walking through the rooms and taking pictures. The weather was cold and rainy so we didn’t get to spend much time in the backyard but it was equally impressive and thoughtfully laid out. Perfect if you are bringing a pup. The beds were super comfortable and every room was well-stocked with anything you might need. Just a few minutes by car to the cute downtown area and a short drive to HEB. We loved it all!"

Five of us ladies rented this adorable house for our fun girls week. The house was very nicely decorated. We all enjoyed the fun art work. We ate at the house every evening and the kitchen was well stock, organized and clean. The back yard was just as shown in the pictures. We very much enjoyed relaxing outside in the morning and evenings. I would not hesitate recommending this house to anyone wanting to make a trip to Round Top. It was an easy 30 minute drive to the antiquing. It is located in a sweet neighborhood and we felt very safe."

From the moment, we walked through the front door you are greeted by beautiful decor and an immediate sense of feeling at home. The home is peaceful and The backyard is perfect for unwinding in the evening or enjoying a cup of coffee before the sun rises. You certainly see the love put into this home through all the details…of course…..the ducks were our favorite part.
They have thought of everything! From a well stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, soft linens, and even pain relievers by your bedside for those days when traveling takes a toll on you.
The neighborhood is very quiet, and located very close to anything you need. You will not be disappointed by booking and staying at this location."

Every wall in the house had a wow-factor! My favorite one was with the wall with the tic-tac-toe that we played several times which was so fun! The outdoor space had swings that my boys loved. The dinning and covered patio was great for grilling and hanging out. Host was very responsive, flexible, and exceeded all of our expectations.

When we booked, we thought it might be pricy, but now we think it was very reasonable for the quality.

She met us when we arrived to give us a small tour, and even in the winter and the freeze the place is beautiful. She also has two sweet puppies who will greet you and love on you, but not intrude into your personal space. Just a very very sweet welcome. The location felt safe, and was near anything we could have needed in the area. Everything was well stocked with snacks, coffee, and even toiletries! We enjoyed everything about this place, and definitely hope to be back! If this were a travel nurse contract site, best believe she would never have a vacancy! 10/10 for sure!"

Even the shower tile is beautiful. Everything is well curated, we had everything we needed, and it was a delightful place to spend a night."

Stayed one night","My husband and I spontaneous decided to find a place to stay and did not want to book a room at a hotel. It was late like 930 at night on a Saturday. I didn’t know if i would get a response, being so late, but I did! She was very kind and helpful.
When we arrived, we immediately loved it. That was before I even turned any lights got turned on. I could just tell that it was a unique beautiful place.
When we got inside, it was more than I expected. Very clever ways of decorating using fun. antiques with a modern twist. The bed was very comfortable and the soft sheets were lovely. It was everything I had hoped for and then some. It was private and romantic. And the location was awesome.
In the morning, I went outside to the yard and enjoyed all the little details and love that were put into the garden. I enjoyed it very much.
I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back. 🤗"

I asked our host, Kelsey, for some last-minute Brenham recommendations and she responded within minutes and encouraged us to go directly to the Blue Bell Creamery, as I had no idea that the ice cream observatory closed early. My daughters had the most wonderful time learning about how ice cream was made and trying numerous flavors. We then ended up eating a delicious lunch, shopping, and meeting friendly locals.
Check-in at the house was smooth and easy, the street was quiet and safe. The whole family enjoyed the relaxing patio porch swing. The house decor is cozy, comfortable and elegant. Kelsey had left a thoughtful surprise in fridge for my daughters. The playroom upstairs kept the children entertained with toys and books and beautiful skylights. We had a wonderful time and I would highly recommend Kelsey’s place! We will be back! Thank you!"

The home itself was charming and comfortable. My four and six year old boys thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the home. The barn had several games for the boys and the adults to play. It was truly the perfect place for this holiday.
To be clear, I am always hesitant about rentals because of past experience, but this was the best experience I have had. There have not been any surprise charges, or any shortcomings in what was provided at the house. We have had several bad experiences, but this was definitely a great experience that makes me want to do it again."

There were plenty of places to gather as well as places to slip away from the noise (pond, hammock, ...). The party barn was a huge plus - cornhole, foosball, games... all while staying cool from the summer heat.
At the end of the day, we watched the sun peak behind the hill and light up the sky with beautiful colors, then relaxed in the pool. With the party barn, those who wanted to stay up later could have fun while others were able to get some sleep in the comfy beds.
The bar is set really high for the next family vacation ..."

All the amenities were fabulous - the pool, pond, party barn, games made it so there was never a boring moment. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a vacation with family or friends!"

Stayed with a pet","Clean home with towels, shampoo, conditioner, etc. The owner was very responsive. The beds were comfortable. The sunsets and sunrises were beautiful.
The house was much smaller than the pictures made it seem. We also came with a 4 month old baby and the house was in the 50s when we arrived so we put the heat on at 70 and an hour later it was almost 80 degrees upstairs in both bedrooms. We were told to open a window which didn’t help much. The remote control volume did not work which was talked about and she took off a $50 hot tub charge which was nice but not being able to watch anything in the main living room wasn’t ideal. The hot tub was $50 to turn on and you had to tell her the hours you wanted to use it. Understandable bc propane but wasn’t told I until hours after it was turned on that the $50 was not actually for the full day. It’s hard to know what our schedule was going to be with 3 babies under 2. Ping pong table is broken and balls were smashed."

The home was conveniently located near HEB, other stores and downtown but situated in a way that felt like we were far away in the quiet country. It was furnished very well with comfy beds and nice decor. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed for cooking. The barn was our favorite hang out spot for the group as we watched the football game, played ping pong, shuffle board and foos ball. The kids loved the pickle ball court and the fishing dock. We caught huge bass and pretty perch, paddled around in kayaks. The hot tub was a nice place to relax at the end of the day. Adrienne was such an amazing host and answered any questions we had very promptly. We will be back!!"

The party barn also had cool AC and really was so much fun with all the games. We celebrated 2 birthdays. The seating was perfect for decorating, eating and serving cake. The house is well stocked with lots of cooking items and plenty of dishes, glasses etc. The primary bedroom with the comfortable mattress and the double shower head was like a high end luxury hotel. The area is quiet with no traffic noise, trains, barking dogs. Just grasshoppers, frogs and cicadas. The sunsets are beautiful. The property is so peaceful with spectacular views all day too. We will be talking about our trip here for many years to come."

The outdoor areas are gorgeous and inviting. And WHAT a view at sunset! And the indoors were just SO comfortable and homey. We were all so sad to have to leave, and agreed we would definitely be coming back.
One thing I have to talk about in depth - THE BED IN THE MASTER. Truly, I’ve never had a more comfortable sleeping experience in an Airbnb. Like, not even close. Sighhhh take me back.
And also, the homeowners provided such kind and responsive service throughout our stay. We very much appreciated it!
All in all, we had just the loveliest a weekend and can’t wait to return. A big THANK YOU to these wonderful homeowners for sharing their home with us!"

The party barn was a lifesaver since it was a rainy weekend. We had several ping-pong ""tournaments"" and the karaoke machine provided great entertainment. Sitting in the hot tub was the perfect ending to each night and although we had to text Adrienne to have it turned on, she was always quick to respond and get it going for us.

Adrienne made sure we were prepared to keep an extra close eye on our toddler and the pool area (no cover or fence but we went in knowing that so it was not a problem). The home and pool were extremely clean and the decor was lovely and very comfortable. My children did virtual schooling from the barn and hammocks which was pretty awesome! We drove to Round Top and into Brenham. Our favorite thing was watching the kids swing in the hammocks & swim while enjoying stunning sunsets on the back porch. This place is built for quality family time. Thank you for sharing it with us!

Adrienne was very communicative and replied to my questions quickly. It is in a rural area but very close to everything you'd need like a Walmart and a HEB. Also, I came prepared to do a deep cleaning before we got comfortable but the house was VERY clean. Everything smelled of bleach and Lysol in the best possible way. It made our stay even more comfortable in these pandemic times. Lastly, in case anyone is curious, the pool is around 5' deep all the way through but the hot tub (when not heated) is a great ""kiddie pool"" for the little ones. Highly recommend."

Group trip","If you’re looking for a good weekend getaway from the city look no further. This place has it all. With a large kitchen, open floor plan and party barn, there is lots of room for a big family gathering. The pool is an oasis and a great way to beat the Texas heat. Forget anything, there is a Walmart and HEB just five minutes down the road. Adrienne is super responsive and accommodating. One of our best AirBnb experiences for sure. We’ll be planning a return trip real soon. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this wonderful farmhouse was just perfect. We arrived to a beautiful country setting, and also to a very clean, stylish house. There were lots of amenities we appreciated - great WiFi (one person had to work from home), a well-stocked kitchen, extra kitchen spices, outdoor speakers, and a great fire pit where we gathered and roasted s'mores after dinner. And, at the end of the day it was a treat to climb into super comfy beds. Bonus for us was definitely the swimming pool and hot tub, and the dock with plentiful fishing. We are already planning our trip back. *Communicating with Adrienne was easy and helpful. She was quick to respond.* Highly recommend this beautiful, idyllic farmhouse with modern amenities."

Stayed with kids","The home was beautifully decorated and clean. The beds were lush and comfortable. The kitchen well equipped for any meal prep/making. Plenty of amenities for an amazing stay.
Our children insisted on a pool, which the home had, but spent most of their time in the pond. So much fun!!! The fire pit was a hit as well, perfect for s’more making.
The home is nestled far enough out from the main city to soak in that peaceful, quiet setting, but surprisingly close enough to everyday conveniences like the grocery store.
This short stay was very enjoyable and the host was more than accommodating allowing us to book less than 24 hours before our stay."

There are so many activities to do on their property - pool, visit the pond, take a hike, play in the barn which was loaded with kid friendly activities (shuffle board, ping pong, corn hole)! Adrienne was also gracious enough to allow us to use her garden where she had fresh mint, basil, cherry tomatoes, and cilantro. All of which were great additions to our cocktails and homemade pizzas! If you want a relaxing getaway in the country, this spot is perfect! The house is also not far from the downtown area if you're looking for something to do outside of the home. Thanks, Adrienne!"

Stayed a few nights","If you’re tired of renting aging BnBs furnished with donated furniture & threadbare linens, this refreshing space will earn your 5* rating. This listing satisfied all my desired qualities.
—clean: new & well-maintained appliances, fixtures & finishes provide a new-house feel.
—spacious: simple layout with the ideal amount of furniture & placement. Sleeps plenty without trying to jam in extra people or furniture.
—location: walking distance to everything worth visiting.
—easy-access: simple private keypad w/flexible check-in. well-concealed keypad & safe check-in.
—comfort: soft, clean linens, comfortable bed & furniture & extra amenities (dishes, soap, linens, snacks).
—parking: ideal private parking with multiple options.
—snacks: pampered us with extras — so many tempting snacks but so little time.
This is the type of place you hope for when you book a BNB even for a long-term stay. Thanks for sharing, Susan."

The beds are quite comfy and the sheets felt amazing.
We loved how she has the living room set up with a couch and chairs facing each other. It was great for family time, and the leather couch is quite comfy.
Susan also left snacks for us, and a bottle of Moscato, which happens to be our favorite wine. My college aged son really enjoyed the snacks. Thank you for the extra thoughtful touch, Susan.
I highly recommend this lovely space for a weekend away. We very much enjoyed our stay."

The home was very clean, including the bathroom tile grout, which is something I always look at. The beds and sheets were nice. Kitchen has everything you would need to cook.
The TV is only streamingservices without an antenna, so that's just something to be prepared for if you're planning on watching local channels for a football game or something. It's a great setup for your streaming entertainment."

The gift basket of goodies, drinks in the fridge, etc. were well received on a late arrival and busy weekend. The beds were the most comfortable we've slept on away from home in quite some time (and we travel at least once a month!)
The ONLY thing I could complain about was having to go to the back of the house to get inside, as only it has a keypad, not the front door. Normally, this probably wouldn't be a big deal, but getting in at midnight, this was less than desirable. Very small complaint though, easily out weighted by everything else being perfect. We would DEFINITELY stay here again!"

Unfortunately, every day there was a group of vagrants (with multiple open booze bottles on the curb) on the corner of Pecan and Market St. - just mentioning for other guests as I didn’t expect this in Brenham.
The house met our needs. I would suggest to add some comfortable outdoor seating. The evenings were beautiful but the backless tractor stools offered no comfort. We ended up sitting in the grass. Our 2 dogs enjoyed the spacious backyard.
Susan reached out prior to check-in to let us know a fan was not working and offered to bring one by. This was not necessary as the AC worked fine and kept us cool. Nice place for a great price!"

I had stayed previously at the Craftsman Cottage and really loved it, so definitely wanted to book again. We needed a bit more space, so decided to book both. Both properties are top-notch and probably the best air bnb's I've ever stayed at. The homes are just really thoughtfully appointed with great amentias and conveniences, and Susan is an awesome host -- super communicative, quick to respond, accommodating and kind. I appreciated all of the convenient charging stations, bathroom amenities, and the snacks and wine were such a lovely and thoughtful touch! Regarding Blue Cottage: Wonderfully located walking distance (about .7 miles) from downtown, in a lovely neighborhood. The house is adorable, with all the aforementioned amenities. There's a really sizable backyard, too! Super comfy beds. Thank you!!"

Not only did she give a list of local spots, great restaurants, and beautiful views she made sure the house was stocked. She had everything you would need for a weekend stay plus mini Blue Bell ice creams in the fridge to indulge on. The house was spotless and welcoming. Can’t wait to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband & I (plus our dog) had a great stay at the Blue Cottage. It was clean, cute, quiet, comfortable, and had plenty of room for the three of us, plus a doggie playpen. Keypad check-in was super easy, and Susan replied instantly with a solution when we contacted her by phone about a problem we had a few days into our stay & the issue was easily and immediately resolved. The house was in a quiet residential neighborhood close to the historic downtown area & was easy to find and to get to. Things were nicely updated inside. We enjoyed the mix of snacks, water, and ice cream left for us, and could easily have cooked full meals in the large kitchen (if there weren’t so many great restaurants in town to choose from!) Great value, great stay, great communication, we would happily stay here again."

The host was always very nice and communicative.

In addition, the cottage is centrally located to anything in the Brenham area that you might want to do.
The one criticism I have is the lack of a place to unpack your clothes. I'm not fond of living out of a suitcase. But the pluses of staying here FAR outweighed that single negative!"

Place:  Nice and cozy. Good size for us and our two little doggies. Backyard was good and flat for them - we just kept them on leases as the yard is not fully enclosed (as noted in their info).  Shower was great, bed comfy and good place to relax after a day out. 
Local experience: Close to the little downtown and other antiques we wanted to check out. 
Thank you for your hospitality.  "

Found this amazing place close to home, but still in the wonderful countryside. I would wake up and and be in a magical woodland. I would swim at 6am, the birdsong, the wind chimes and the waterfall from the pool was enough relaxation to last for months. I had and Horses as my neighbours. Little doggos as our welcome guests. So so quiet you could hear a pin drop. The house was absolutely gorgeous. French/Texas country. Chic and modern. Clean and fully stocked. We even wine waiting for us. Gorgeous views of a pond with water fountain, cascading skies, views of the moon and the sunrise. Sparking stars, wind whistling through the trees. We took a visit to a local winery, ate at some local food spots, spent some time walking and reading. At night we had movies and full WIFI. Totally private, and I can't wait to visit again!!!!!

Stayed a few nights","Lois’s place was such a lovely weekend getaway! Talk about a peaceful, picturesque place to stay! The guest house is even more spacious than the photos let on. The two king beds were incredibly comfortable. My mom and I loved enjoying happy hour out by the pool and dipping our toes in the water. It was also a treat to get to observe the cows, donkeys, and horses just on the other side of the fence and totally reminded us that we were not in the city anymore! Lois was by far one of the most generous and thoughtful hosts, and left wine and little snacks in the fridge for breakfast that were perfect! 10 out of 10 would recommend and hope to be back one day soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Mrs. Lois's guest house and property were wonderful. My mom and I made a weekend trip to Round Top and stayed 4 nights. Check in was easy...the house was very comfortable....and the scenery was great too. It was only about 10 min from Brenham so we got take-out each night and ate at the house. It took about 30 min to get to Round Top which is not bad at all. Soft beds, comfy towels, your own coffee....and the best part....was Lois had a little ""breakfast treat"" waiting for us on arrival day. I even enjoyed opening a bottle of wine she had left for us---which of course is a great way to end a long day of antiquing. =)"

We literally just hung out in the pool and lounged the entire weekend - did not want to leave! Would go back in a heartbeat, and brainstorming when we will return. Lois is amazing and attentive. She’s there and available to help, but you totally have your space. We were going for my husbands birthday and there was a cake waiting for him when we arrived! Hands down, definitely a must book.

It was very clean and comfortable, the pool was wonderful (I swam and sat out reading in the shade in the quiet for 5 hours!), you had absolute privacy even though the main house is right next to the cottage, it was so quite aside from nature which was so calming, and it was a short drive in to town when you wanted to go in. We will more than likely stay again and definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet and relaxed getaway for downtime to recharge."

We made a last minute decision to go shopping at Round Top and this was the only place we could rent!!! So glad we did!! We were first welcomed by 4 SWEET furry friends, then inside there were fresh flowers, a candle burning and a beautiful CLEAN place!! There were also 2 comfy robes available to wear and all the shampoo, soap and amazing hand cream to use:)
Lois was easy to reach and very helpful with everything! I would highly recommend this place for a weekend getaway with your kids, your girlfriends or your significant other!! Oh and I almost forgot Lois also had snacks, drinks and wine for us which again was an added bonus!!! I would LOVE to find a jewel like this property myself!!! Thanks again Lois for a wonderful weekend."
