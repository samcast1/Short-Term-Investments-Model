Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had a great time at Eugene’s place. It was a short drive to all the historical sites - 5 to 15 minute drives. The projector was great when unwinding in the evening.
I had some questions and things I wanted modified during our trip. Eugene was very kind, helpful and responsive.
Would visit again."

Stayed with kids",Eugene’s place was a perfect place for our week long visit to Richmond. He was easy to get ahold of and accommodating. The projector TV was perfect for March Madness and movies. The chair swing was a unique touch. Walking distance to some decent restaurants & a quick (free) bus ride to downtown. Fit our needs for the week. :)

Stayed a few nights","What a GREAT place to stay!!! We've been staying in AirBnB's in Richmond for the last 5 years (2 VCU kids) and this place did not disappoint. Eugene was super communicative. The space is EXACTLY as pictured- but what you don't see is that little swing by the breakfast bar can be ingeniously switched to face out to the living room so you can swing AND watch a movie on the projector- it was perfect. There are 2 couches that you can lay on in the living room and a chair that converts to a bed- so plenty of places to relax. Seriously, super comfy. The king size bed was also a bonus as it was soft and cuddly. There is a super neat sky light in the bedroom with a remote operated shade. Simply close it at night and you are good to go! Eugene is clear that this space doesn't have as many kitchen amenities as you might need, but also offered to bring us what we needed in a moments notice. The space was REALLY clean, quiet and very relaxing. We'll definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Eugene is a great host, and we enjoyed our stay at this apartment!
Pros: Just as pictured. My teens loved the modern style, the cool swing, the popcorn maker, and the amazing projector for streaming videos. A simple but well-kept place, clean, a short drive to anywhere you want to go in RVA. Eugene is friendly and welcoming. This was a great place for us to stay during a kid’s sports tournament, and I was able to work from the apartment between games.
Could improve: Hesitate to leave negatives because Eugene let me know the place is a new listing and he is still setting up. But other guests may want to know — kitchen stocking is very limited (no baking pan, dishwasher detergent). Not a big deal, just stepped out to grab but would have brought if I’d known. If you want to cook, bring what you’ll need. Also, trains at night are very loud. Also not a big deal (nothing wakes my teens), but I’d stay elsewhere or bring earplugs if you need a quiet place to sleep.
Overall, we recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Eugene’s place is great - the only things that were notable were the skylight directly above the bedroom that lights up the entire apartment when the sun rises. The large projector on the wall is great, but in my opinion it was too large for the small room it sits in. The apartment is right beside railroad tracks and the walls are considerably thin, so if you’re a sensitive sleeper this may be a tough sleep for you.
Otherwise Eugene was very kind and offered to help with my bags and communicated very well the entire stay."

Stayed a few nights","This is an awesome Airbnb, and Eugene is an excellent host. He is very responsive and pro-active. The place is in the heart of a very vibrant area in Richmond with coffee shops and restaurants close by. Parking is very convenient and safe as well. Its very easy to get to and find and Eugene's instructions were very clear and easy to follow. Check in is easy as well. The space is very clean and has everything you need with some unique and cool features. Very roomy and well lit. Eugene has a projector style TV that projects against a wall in the living room so its like you are the movie theatre. Eugene even provides popcorn with a popcorn maker and a variety of butter flavored salts. A lot of fun!! Bedroom is spacious and bed is very comfortable. i will definately stay here again! Excellent time!"

The area is up-and-coming, and I was afraid there might be industrial or construction noise, but it was really quiet. Not very walkable, but I didn't expect it to be. It's a brand new place so really clean, the bed was super comfy, and the projector TV was much better than I expected (for the best picture, turn off all the lights in the room)."

Stayed a few nights","I have nothing but glowing things to say about John and Lisa’s airbnb! The place is beautiful with all of the murals and sleek furniture, the location is right in the heart of Carytown but still feels quiet and private, and Lisa was just the absolute sweetest. She was so accommodating and always thinking one step ahead to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. She made sure the fire pit was lit for us which was a great way to spend a night in, but there were just so many things to do within walking distance so we spent most nights wandering around, going to great restaurants and a show at the Byrd Theater! Would absolutely stay here again and already wishing we could be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a terrific AirBnB. IMO-it is best for one or two guests. Clearly, a lot of thought went into the design of this space, and John and Lisa have paid attention to the details. It's very well maintained. Everything worked like it was new. The carriage house is situated behind the owner's home on an alley that is well lit and has a safe feel--and the location lends itself to quiet and peaceful time. Natural light can be plentiful, or you can go into ""cave mode"" and block it out--I stayed for two nights on a business trip and slept very well both nights...not just because I could block out all light, but the bed was very comfortable. The space has two large televisions, and the hosts supplied bottled water and sparkling beverages in the refrigerator, and the coffee maker was ready for use. Great restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are within an easy walk (2 blocks). If this location is available when you visit the River City, I recommend you reserve it."

I could have laid in that bed without moving during my entire stay, definitely more comfortable than any Airbnb/hotel bed I’ve ever slept in with the softest sheets. The bathroom and shower was that of a spa, the whole place just felt luxurious. It really was in the heart of the town, just a quick walk to so many wonderful restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Everything was immaculately clean, comfortable and not to mention, the ambiance. I wish I could have stayed longer.

Stayed a few nights","This house is so well designed, and in such a great area of Richmond. A great spot for two people to get away and explore Carytown in Richmond. The inside was gorgeous, well laid out, and had everything you could need. On the outside, it feels like you are in a little oasis in the city, and then you can take a few steps and be right in the heart of Carytown. We slept great in the comfy queen bed, then went out in the morning to Sugar and Twine, the coffee shop around the corner, and came back to open up the window shades to take in the awesome scenery. The rest of the day, having a hub in Carytown was awesome. It really blew our mind how we were right in the main area, but in such a beautiful, comfy, secluded spot. The private entrance to the detached carriage house was easy to use, and safe at all hours of the day or night. Every detail seems to be taken into consideration in this house. This is a phenomenal spot."

The bed was super comfortable and the pillows as well...I have issues with my back and neck so that's saying a mouthful!! Loved the shower and whole bathroom. The ambiance was amazing....the decorations, the wallpaper....so classy and creative. I wish I could have stayed longer! I loved how you can make the atmosphere super dark because I can't sleep with even a little bit of light! John's place has everything you need and much more! The kitchen is amazing....if I had been staying longer, I would have enjoyed cooking there but since I was only there for a short time, the restaurants that are in Carytown are great....lots to try out and I could walk everywhere. It was very easy with the codes to get in and out. John even let me check in early which was great! I felt very safe and SUPER COMFORTABLE and fun!! I'll be going back!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place just as it was described. Location was just what we wanted so we could ride our bikes all over to get to restaurants museums coffee shops etc Really great to have a private parking space and secure spot for our bikes. Bill responded to questions very promptly, had some Wi-Fi problems. The space is part of an upstairs of a beautiful two story house. Note you can hear family's goings on. Would stay again."

Loved the old architecture of the building and the design of the apartment and the area was very safe and convenient. It was too cold to use the balcony but it is a lovely bonus as well. So nice to have multiple options for breakfast and coffee/tea ready to go! Loved having some good English tea with milk and sugar in bed in the mornings. Bill was very welcoming and kind without being overbearing!

Stayed about a week","This is a wonderful apartment in a beautiful neighborhood. No doubt Bill,s wife, an interior architect , had a hand in the very pleasing details of the space. I highly recommend it. It has all the details I consider important: a comfortable bed with good lamps on both sides, two generous bureaus for clot, a roomy closet with plenty of hangars, nice high windows that open to let in fresh air and good coffee making equipment.
In addition there’s a very nice balcony overlooking Bill and Lisa’s garden. Bill left us quite a bit of food: fresh blueberries, cereals, milk, yogurts, English muffins-very generous. He asked us immediately if we needed anything, and was very responsive to our requests.
The kitchen is not for cooking big meals, there’s no stove, and a small fridge. But it was perfect for our needs. There are lots of wonderful restaurants nearby and throughout Richmond. It’s a beautiful city and this neighborhood is glorious. Very walkable including to several museums."

The stairs to get to the apartment are quite steep but this was called out in the description so no surprise. The apartment is located on a corner which was pretty busy with people outside quite late. At 3 am, I went out on the balcony and people were still walking by. But that was the only issue. Otherwise, we were very happy with the location."

Stayed about a week","Spent 10 nights at Bill and Lissa's oasis in the Fan while attending the National Genealogical Society conference. Could not have asked for a better location or more accommodating hosts. It's a very walkable historic residential area with many excellent restaurants, museums, and quaint shops nearby. Most days the car remained parked. You can walk to downtown in about 30 minutes or catch the free rapid transit Pulse with a 10-minute stroll up to Broad Street. Carytown is about 10 minutes away by foot. The space itself is comfortable, private, and quite inside. A balcony overlooking the flower garden is a great spot to enjoy the coffee and breakfast treats from the kitchen. Bill and Lissa are interesting and affable hosts that can provide great tips on the area."

Both Bill and Lissa had many recommendations for us and were so friendly, accommodating, and helpful! We would ABSOLUTELY stay here again, we even tried to add an extra night but they book up fast, so don’t miss your chance at the perfect spot!

The location in Richmond's Fan District was perfect great walkable area to both restraunts and sights. yet dedicated off-street parking made it easy to visit sights farther a field! Then there is the apartment! The steep and narrow staircase to the 2nd floor is initially intimidating but well worth the climb! The kitchen was superbly stocked - several boxes of cereal, fruit, yogurt, milk, half and half and 12 - yes 12! - different boxes of coffee pods! The bed was great for sleeping and the shower water was hot with good pressure. Bill had even decorated for the holidays with a couple of poinsettias in the apartment and a garland on the outside door. On top of all that, Bill is friendly and gracious. When we visit Richmond next, I hope this rental is available!"

Stayed a few nights","I have to start my review by saying that Bill and Lissa seem like very nice people and our interactions with them were pleasant. Our stay was only okay, however, due to a mismatch between our expectations and actual experience. We expected the “private apartment” to be a fully separate residence, but it felt more like a set of rooms closed off from the main house by an unlocked interior door. The space does not have its own temperature control and it was quite warm. We ran into Bill on our way out to dinner and he kindly asked how the temperature was and said he’d turn it down a little for us. We still felt warm overnight and had to open the door to the balcony to sleep comfortably. On the positive side, the location is great, the bed was comfortable (too firm for my husband, but comfortable for me), the blackout curtains were great, and the breakfast foods and Keurig were a nice touch. I think guests who know all this in advance, are comfortable staying in a space connected to a primary residence, and interacting with the owners would enjoy this place. It just wasn’t the right fit for us. We ended up checking out early and staying with friends for our second night in Richmond because it was more comfortable for us."

We love older homes and all the characteristics they have! This home has that and more. Being an older home the stairs are steep so if that’s a problem this isn’t the place for you. It was clean, breakfast foods were more than ample! My husband loved the keurig, I was happy that there was a water cooker for the teas I brought with me! Bill was a wonderful host with ample suggestions of places and things to see and do."

The kitchen is well and very thoughtfully stocked with cereal supplies, coffee options, and other convenient basics. The property is conveniently located in this beautiful and historic neighborhood of Richmond. Bill and Lissa were gracious and kind hosts.
The toilet and shower were not working optimally when we were here, but we were told they would be fixed soon. Be aware that there is an exceptionally tall, narrow, and steep set of stairs leading up to where you’ll be staying - if you have any mobility issues, this property probably isn’t a good fit for you. Be aware too that the bed is very firm - a great fit for some but not all!"

The kitchen was stocked with cereals, milk, fresh fruit, English muffins - and even soups to heat up in the evening. The location was wonderful! We took a walk in the neighborhood and the colorful trees and elegant Victorian homes were delightful. There were plenty of cafes and groceries nearby. Stairs to our rooms were a bit steep, but not a problem. We'd definitely stay there again."

It is located in a safe and quiet neighborhood - great location within walking distances to restaurants. Bill was very kind and made sure I had everything I need. The place is sparkling clean! The mattress is firm and so comfortable that I had a hard time getting up in the morning. This is one of a kind find and if you are ever lucky enough to book it, don’t hesitate. It’s truly a home away from home and I can’t wait to return for another stay."

Bill is available for tips on things to do and places to eat, and otherwise gives you all the privacy you might want. There’s not a real kitchen - no oven or stove - but having a separate room that holds a small fridge, microwave, toaster, sink, dishes and coffee maker makes the place feel like an apartment. The balcony was especially nice!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic stay here. It was central to exploring all of Richmond but the neighborhood itself was so sweet and had plenty to do. The kitchen was stocked with breakfast foods, coffees, teas, etc which enabled us to never need to eat out for breakfast. The entry to and from was easy to use and we felt like we had a high level of privacy. We only ran into our hosts once and never heard them during our stay. There was a really nice balcony for us to sit out and drink coffee that overlooks a really lovely English garden. I would absolutely recommend anyone to stay here! The stairs to get in and out are very steep which is mentioned in the listing but should be taken as a serious precaution for anyone who can't handle a steep climb easily."

The space is very sunny but has blackout curtains if that’s not your thing. There is some street noise on weekend nights, but worth it to be in walking distance of so many great Richmond restaurants, bars, and shops! We also really enjoyed having our morning coffee out on the porch overlooking the garden. All-around great and would definitely stay again!"

We could easily walk to Carytown, the VMFA and walkable to Scott’s Addition also. The apartment is very well equipped and extremely comfortable - especially the bed. The kitchen is well stocked - Keurig coffee machine with loads of coffee options available and Bill and Lissa has provided breakfast goodies! Can’t say enough great things about Bill and Lissa. Such warm hosts, they greeted us like we were family and were so generous and helpful with our 10 month old twins. We could have talked to them for hours! We look forward to visiting again."

The breakfast was lovely and generous fuel for a day in Richmond, and the selection of coffee/tea/cider/sparkling water was much appreciated. I would imagine the patio and garden would be a huge perk in nice weather. Lots of natural light, and very thoughtfully appointed. Every time I thought 'It would be nice if there was..""

We especially liked the kitchen- the light coming in and looking out at the lush garden and trees. We didn't cook but thought about doing so the next time we come because there are lovely markets and a butcher within walking distance. Almost everything we did was in walking distance. The house is in a gorgeous neighborhood with restaurants and shops only a few blocks away. The museum is right down the street (and is incredible!). We walked to a concert at the Broadberry. A terrific time in a great city!!
The internet worked great. We were also able to easily connect to the TV to watch a baseball game. Comfy beds. Nice outdoor space in the beautiful back yard or on the front porch.
Cara is a wonderful, responsive host! We highly recommend her place."

Stayed about a week","Cara was the perfect host in every way- thoughtful, gracious, responsive, and really went out of her way to accomdate a number of special requests i had due to allergies. Thank you so much!!
What a sweet home, absolutely charming and welcoming on a lovely tree-lined street with historic character, easy parking right out front, a peaceful and inviting front porch and bright cheery kitchen. The thought and care put into the decor, color palette, and all of the finishings, from the small to the large, is tangible throughout-Oeko-Tex towels, black-out shades in the bedroom, lovely rugs, gallery quality paintings, and the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The only thing that was a little challenging for me was at times turning the lock in the front door (but maybe there's a trick to it?)
The location was super convenient for its proximity to restaurants and coffee. I didn't get to the museum this time, but hope to soon-extremely walkable, beautiful neighborhood!"

The place was just as advertised - just like photos (only better!), clean, comfortable, felt like home, with a well stocked kitchen for cooking if you like. Comfortable beds, lots of natural light in the living area. We just wish it had been cooler outside bc we could not enjoy the nice outdoor spaces. It was a major heat wave.

Stayed with kids","Our family just had an awesome stay at the “Makers Den.” The house was clean, thoughtfully decorated, and well appointed with the things you need to cook a meal, make a cup of coffee, etc.
Comfortable furniture and beds, fast Wi-Fi, and even though it’s a modestly sized house, there are multiple areas to relax (covered front porch, back patio, living room, dining room, etc), so with our family of four (2 young kids), we didn’t feel on top of each other.
Cara is an excellent host—friendly, flexible, kind, responsive, and full of great local knowledge and recommendations. The house is within 2 blocks of the center of Carytown, so we ate somewhere new for every meal didn’t have to drive at all if we didn’t want to venture out of the neighborhood—the house was so close to everything that we rarely used the stroller for our 3 year old.
Street parking was easy and we almost always got a spot out front. We highly recommend Cara’s place for a stay in Richmond!"

While I didn't meet Cara, the host, personally, she was very attentive and helpful via text and email with prompt answers to my questions. Tastefully decorated and inviting with a charming outdoor courtyard in back with a fire table and Weber grill (my husband's favorite place to hang, weather permitting). Do explore the many coffee places in easy walking distance. Close to Ellwoods, Fresh Market and a Publix to allow for at home breakfasts and occasional lunches though great restaurants are to be found in abundance. And check out Scoops for amazing ice cream!
We will try to stay here again on any future visits to Richmond. With our daughter living 8 blocks away there is a good chance of that happening. Have fun!"

Plus it is on a quiet side street with plenty of parking and friendly neighbors. The house is very nicely decorated, and Cara anticipated every single need that we had, from full propane for the grill to plenty of towels to all types of cleaning supplies (we were there for a month so I did some light cleaning as needed). The kitchen is very well stocked for people who like to cook - high quality cookware and knives, cutting boards, colander, even serving dishes and glass stemware. The back yard area was pleasant and private and the street was very quiet.

Plenty of room for the four of us to sit and visit. Wish it has been warmer so we could have used the lovely little patio out back. King bed and queen bed were clean and comfortable, too. (Bring your own pillows unless you like them big and firm.) Can't beat the location -- within walking distance of great museums, restaurants, and shops. I had a question about the lockbox and Cara answered my call immediately. The single, very clean bathroom is small, the bathtub drain backed up during showers, and the sink faucet fixture was wobbly; the water pressure was great. Overall I'd highly recommend this little gem."

An easy walk to the VMFA and all that Carytown has to offer (favorites were Sugar + Twine, Sen Organic, Can Can, and New York Deli). Street parking was a breeze, as was check-in, check-out, and everything in between!
Added bonus, the mattresses were exceedingly comfortable. Got some of my best sleep ever while there!"

Note for small children: you will need to pay attention, lots of corners and decorative pieces, wasn’t a problem for us at all, just something to be aware of."

The house itself is very comfortable and well-appointed — it was perfect for our family of 3 (2 adults and a 7yo). We cooked at least once a day, and the kitchen had everything we needed. The only thing I would add to the kitchen is a crockpot, just so we could be ready to sit down and eat when we finished our adventures for the day.
Highly recommend Cara’s place if you’re in the area! We’ll be back!"

The location is fantastic and a lot of sights are walkable from there just as the museum district and cute Carytown with lots of nice stores, cafes, bars and restaurants. The house truly feels like a home away from home. It is very spacious and the interior is lovely. What's also great is that there is a backyard to relax. Cara is an excellent host and was always there for questions or when I needed something. I can 100% recommend staying here as it does not feel like a vacation home but more like your own. I will for sure come again and cannot wait for that."

Thought-provoking art on the walls (much of if for sale), colorful pottery on the shelves (also for sale), a superb staircase, and every new space uncluttered and refreshing,. You can walk to just about everything in Carytown, and there is so much to look at, eat, and drink (the plethora of incredibly tasteful and well-priced consignment shops were highlights). We spent more time in our one-of-a-kind accommodation than anywhere else, and I stayed until the absolute last minute - check out is 11:00AM! Oh! And because the place was cleaned in the morning, I got to check in four hours early. The hospitality is just super (thanks, Cara). I would definitely stay here again - preferably for a month or two while I finish my first novel ;-). This place is gonna be a popular destination for a long time."

Stayed one night","What a wonderful home just off Carey St.! We especially enjoyed the selection of artwork on display throughout the home and had to purchase several of the gorgeous ceramic mugs on display to bring home! It was a pleasure to meet Cara who lives just across the street. We enjoyed time relaxing on the front porch in the very comfortable overstuffed chairs. Unfortunately showers made the back garden too wet to use, but we still stepped out and enjoyed the space. The light in the back of the house, in the kitchen area, is just wonderful. The beds were comfy, the A/C worked great, very clean and comfortable space. We had no trouble finding parking on the same block as the house, even when we left for dinner and returned. I hope to return to Cara's on future trips to Richmond!"

The location is PERFECTION and within walking distance to some very cool restaurants, shopping and local spots. We will be staying here every time we’re in Richmond, it’s my new go to!

Stayed a few nights","Cara’s place was charming and historic. She responded well and gave us early access to drop our bags off. Due to the age of the house the front door was difficult to open we called Cara and she came over but my husband had worked out how to pull on the door to open it. the water pressure in shower is not too good and non existent when another tap is on. I would suggest placing a window covering in the shower window as you are very exposed to the neighbours when showering. The wifi details were not given, we required this late evening and did not want to call the host at that time of night. If parking is required you may need to park a block or two away at certain times of the day."

Stayed with kids","This is a well-stocked and charmingly decorated home in the museum district. It’s walking distance to restaurants/bars/bakeries/grocery stores (including Elwood Thompson’s, a great natural market), the VMFA, and Virginia History and Culture Museum. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots, a keurig. There is a charming garden. It’s a historic home so the bedrooms and bathroom are up a set of steep stairs which could be challenging for some. As former Richmonders, Kara’s place felt like a chance to relive our time in the city. She even provided wine and baked treats to welcome us!"

Stayed with a pet","Initially, I had reservations about parking since I’m accustomed to the hustle of downtown Boston, but choosing this spot for my stopover from MA to FL turned out to be a great decision.
The nearby park, featuring an extensive trail, was perfect. It provided the perfect opportunity to stretch me & my dogs legs and enjoy some fresh air especially after so many hours in the car.
Concerning parking, my worries were unfounded. I found it surprisingly easy to park right outside the property, a welcome change from the urban parking challenges I’m used to.
The area isn’t heavily trafficked, nestled in a charming suburban neighborhood.
This setting not only gave me a sense of safety but also peace of mind about the security of my belongings in the car.
As for the space itself, it was so cute and impeccably clean.
The location proved to be excellent, aligning perfectly with my (& my dogs) needs.
I will definitely rebook.
Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

It’s not for cooking main meals but is perfect for breakfast and lunch. The location is safe and loved the proximity to the park for walks.

Stayed a few nights","Really an enjoyable stay in a nice quiet family-style neighborhood offering a jumping-off point to so much of what Richmond has to offer! Brittaney, Drew, + tow-headed tot = super-kind and offer plenty of tips. They're the ppl you want as neighbors, back home :) The space itself is within their backyard, is super-clean and new, has room to spread out. Great bed, solid linens, tasteful minimalist design. Once you've stayed, you might want to build your own similar space :)
Super-recommend this location for outdoor-types/cycle/runners/doggos/kiddos. Close to riverside trails and access to Belle Isle. 15-20 min drive/over bridge to shopping/breweries/restaurants in RVA, though some tasty spots are close by. IMO a great stay for just about anyone - top-notch!"

Stayed with a pet","It was a great place to stay for my boyfriend and I and our dog for a little weekend getaway in Richmond. The neighborhood was peaceful and family friendly. They have a park right across the street that was perfect for our dog. Restaurants were about a ten minute drive from the airbnb so it was a good location. The only two things I would say is there was not any space in the bathroom to put our toiletries. And we shared the backyard with the owners so we would hear the gate open and close and didn't necessarily feel comfortable sharing the backyard. The photos looked like it was going to be a bit more private. However, it wasn't bad just if I had to choose something, those were the two things. Everything was great overall though! The bed was extra comfortable and the place was cozy and cute."

Stayed about a week","This cozy spot was tucked away in a neighborhood of bungalo houses. People were walking the neighborhoods, walking dogs, biking, and running, which is not a surprise as it is very close to a beautiful park with great trails, as well as interconnected trails by the James River. This was a great start to my day, as I ran a different trail every time. Some were wide and well groomed, while others were narrow and more suited for hiking due to the footing...but still beautiful and serene. The place is in close proximity to the downtown area, where the huge variety and high quality of food would be dangerous if we lived there! So good! The area had a power outage while we were there, and the owners were quick to respond (I thought maybe it was a breaker issue, but the whole area was down). I say this only because of their quick response and explanation...it did not detract from our stay in the least. This was a great deal and a beautiful space. We would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed with a pet","The space is awesome, conveniently located, and in a nice active neighborhood. My wife, dog, and I tried to get up to Richmond to do some hiking and this place was perfect with close access to the James River Trail system but the weather did not cooperate. Either way, the space itself was very spacious and clean. Loved that we had access to the backyard for our pup to be able to do his business. Was a short drive into Carytown over the toll bridge (35 cents). We even utilized the soundsystem that made waking up to smooth tunes and coffee even more enjoyable. We definitely recommend this BnB to any and everyone looking for a nice modern place to unwind. 100% would stay here again."

I also loved the accents, decorations, snacks and how pet friendly they were! You can tell they really put a lot of care into this space and it shows. Thank you we sure hope we're welcome back as we'd love to stay again in the future!! Also, they have the cutest, sweetest little baby who melted my heart with his smile. 🥰 Thanks again!!"

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb experience frankly should be recognized by the local news. If only I had a TikTok to help Nancy go viral. Nancy, the host, has perfected the art of hosting. She makes herself available 24/7 for anything you might need, big or small, and she truly means it. Each morning, guests are greeted with a freshly brewed cup of coffee perfectly timed to their routine. The common spaces, bedrooms, and especially the linens are SPOTLESS, and due to my longer stay I was able to see how hard Nancy worked to clean and prepare in between guests. If hesitant about the low price or the area, don't be; the prices are just incredibly fair (not looking to profiteer), and the street is calm and quiet and a 10 min walk away to some of Richmond's best food stops (Laura Lee's and WPA Bakery) and park (Forest Hill). Many of Nancy's guests rebook, and I did too."

Mrs. Nancy was a very kind hostess that gave clear instructions, let me check in really late into the night, offered some Coffee before I hit the road, & wished me a safe ride home. Unparalled Value too. If I ever come back to Richmond I'd likely book Mrs Nancy's place again if it's available. The only knock I could give is that while the neighborhood itself is decently nice and quiet, the area I had to drive through to get to the neighborhood felt sketchy to me."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was even better in person than in the pictures. Communication from time of rental to the end of my stay was absolutely top notch! The apartment and its amenities are well thought out. If I needed anything, all I had to do was look and it was there, down to a stepstool to reach the higher shelves on the well stocked cabinets. The decor is Modern but feels very homey. The bed was the most comfortable of any Airbnb/hotel I’ve stayed in. I want to gatekeep this rental, but I won’t. This will be my go-to l when I travel to -or through Richmond. I can also say this, my husband ended up joining me for part of my trip and he really enjoyed staying there as well. (and I have never heard him say that before.) the restaurants in the immediate vicinity are great, as well as the little convenience shop right next door. Thank you to Jon and Jonathan for an amazing stay! If you are traveling to Richmond, you can’t go wrong staying here. The cherry on top? The reserved parking space!"

Well stocked kitchen and other amenities. Nice touches like a sleep machine and phone chargers at the bed side. The dedicated parking space in the rear is a huge plus. Exterior doors are keypad secured. The neighborhood is nice and there are good restaurants and shops withing walking distance. Great central location and access to the greater RVA area is pretty easy to navigate by car from this location. Uber/Lyft was an easy option for us too. Overall an A+ for us for value, cleanliness, the unit itself, and overall great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","The bed has the most outstanding mattress on the planet. No exaggeration: it’s perfect! Pillows are available in different varieties, and a white noise machine ensured that I got some of the best sleeps of my life. I loved the coffee and tea bar! Didn’t get to use the kitchen because I wanted to try every one of the bazillion choices of restaurants within walking distance. Also walkable: a few markets are right nearby, St. John’s is just up the hill and the Canal, Tredegar Ironworks, and Main St Station just down the way. Felt very safe walking around, coming and going, and leaving my car. Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home. Truly didn’t want to leave. 💔"

Stayed with kids","We booked this Johnathan's place after the first booking got cancelled due to the host needing to have work done on their house.
We wanted something specifically in the downtown corridor and close to the Convention center. We fell in love with the apartment right away and had a great time. The decoration and amenities were wonderful, as well as the binder of recommendations. We went to Oak and Apple for dinner the first night and it was amazing BBQ, only a block away. Try the Ciders!
We enjoyed breakfast from The Whisk with delicious pasties!
I would definitely stay again! Thank you for a wonderful time!"

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely fabulous stay at Jon and Jonathan's condo. The condo is spacious and comfortable. The bed is wonderful. Kitchen is well stocked. The condo was spotless. We loved the location in Shockoe Bottom. We felt very safe there, and the streets are well populated all day and evening. The condo is easily walkable to the canal trail and multiple restaurants. Downtown and Church Hill are slightly longer walks (approximately 1/2 mile) and readily walkable. Parking is great. The condo is next to the wonderful Poe museum and house. Jon and Jonathan work in the building below the condo and are readily available for questions or support. One of the best airbnb's I have stayed at.
One note-the condo is on the second floor and getting to the condo unit involves climbing 12-15 steps. The bedroom is on the second floor of the condo. The photos show this well. For visitors with significant mobility problems, this may be an issue but is not for those without physical limitations"

We loved Johnathan’s decor and layout of the spacious apartment. The original brick walls were beautiful. The kitchen is well stocked and the entire place is spacious and well-designed. However for those of you less mobile- there are a lot of stairs involved. It’s proximity to my daughter was perfect for us, but also walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars. The back parking spot was perfect for us, and I loved walking to whisk for a morning latte.
Thanks for a lovely stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The loft was beautifully decorated, well-appointed, comfortable, and cozy. Loved the exposed brick, wall mural, and tile in the bathroom. Sleeping space and changing nook were perfect. We didn't do any cooking, but the kitchen was well stocked with appliances and a coffee center. So nice to have a parking space within easy access to the building. Drawbacks were the flight of stairs to the second floor condo - it took several trips up and down to unload the car, but we expected that because it was well-advertised. There is also a club across from the alley behind the condo that must have closed at 2:00 am, which is when people spilled into the street making lots of noise. We were looking for a place within walking distance to the Richmond Folk Festival, and Johnathan's place fit that criteria. It was a leisurely 25 minute walk through a hip neighborhood with lots of character, then along the canal to Brown's Island."

The lulling of cars passing by, combined with the steady rotation of the overhead fan, made me feel safe and brought back memories of my youth. It was so nice to walk outside to the Main Street and be so close the local shops and restaurants.
The host was very aware of what amenities were best provided for a maximum guest experience. The decor was not only tasteful trendy but the color scheme did not disappoint.
If recommend this space and the host. I look forward to returning regularly.
I send much gratitide and appreciation to the host. He was very attentive. I will be back. I will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Jonathan’s place for two nights while visiting Richmond over Memorial Day weekend. Overall, it was fantastic - very clean, easy to access, extremely walkable to local shops/bars/restaurants, and really well appointed. The only thing wrong with our stay at Jonathan’s place was that we didn’t book it longer. There is a lot to do in and around Richmond, especially in the shockoe slip/bottom area so take that into account if you're planning a visit.
As for the interior, the loft space was beautiful and had the industrial feel of exposed wooden beams and concrete, but with excellent minimalist decor that added a touch of warmth. If you like that style, you will love this place. The pictures are very accurate. Appliances were new and in great shape, bathroom was very clean with great shower and tub. Washer and dryer in unit was a major plus. Roku enabled TVs worked well and were easy to cast to for music and video, and the wifi was strong throughout the unit. Bed was comfortable and the AC split units in the bed and living areas allowed for easy temperature control throughout the entire space. Definitely recommended for those that like to be close to amenities, restaurants, bars, etc.
Jonathan was a great host and was very communicative even though we didn't really need much assistance because it was all detailed out in the instructions.
Great place and great time - we would certainly stay at Jonathan's again."

I walked to whisk that morning and ran to the venue that afternoon! 💕

Apartment is in a convenient area with plenty of food options around. We also appreciated the laundry machines and good water pressure + temperature in the shower! The couch seemed like a show-couch...quite firm, so we ended up sitting on the (admittedly very comfy) rug more often than not. Check in is very easy, key code to enter the building and another key code to release your apartment key by the door. Off-street parking was also a huge plus – parking can be a little hard to find during certain hours in Richmond. Would definitely recommend this place for someone traveling on business."

I didn’t use a car during my stay, and the public bus routes were very accessible. Check in was simple. The AirBnb itself was clean and cozy. I would stay here again if I return to Richmond."

The apartment is gorgeous, with everything you need as far as cooking, cleaning, extra blankets and pillows etc. easily available to you. It’s in a great location with lots to walk to and having a parking spot is really convenient because parking can be tough in Shockoe Bottom. The hosts were great. I felt very cared for when I was trying to juggle renovation work, the holidays, and a Covid scare. I was kind of sad to go back home when work was done at my place."

Stayed a few nights","beautiful design and home! incredibly responsive host, informative and friendly.
added value: very cozy and large bed, natural light and location is right in the heart of the action downtown however, might not be ideal for those wanting a quieter stay.
spacious, lots of sleeping options and closet/storage areas.
things to consider: during my stay it was 90-95 degrees outside and the central air system was down but they had 2 window units that did a decent job of cooling the place down. they did generate white noise and during the morning/day the upstairs area was hot when getting ready (showering/moving around etc).
no elevator access to my knowledge: would not advise if you are unable to get assistance climbing/descending a steep stairwell with your bags and/or errands.
would book again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great stay at Johnathan’s place.
Lots of Pros – Little things like Keurig coffee pods were supplied, double ply toilet paper (it’s the little things that matter!), nice comfortable firm bed. No lumps or indentions, best Airbnb bed I’ve had in a while. The bed is in the second story loft which is nice. Means no one is above you stomping at night so equals a quiet sleep. The white noise machine is a nice touch too. Even though you’re close to Main St you really can’t hear the traffic unless someone’s bass is blasting through the roof. Water pressure is a touch low (maybe pressure tank for water heater needs more air pressure?), but plenty of hot water. Loved having a washer and dryer too. Lots of local eats to walk to – we went to Carmelas, La Bodega, Tree’s Tacos, Sweet things to name a few Perfect location to attractions we wanted to go to – Maymont, James River, local breweries etc all close by within 10 minutes.
Some Tips:
The door on the back of the building to access parking is labeled Jsquared Interior Staging and Design. The other doors are labeled 1906 and 1904 so you never see a 1908 in the back. First time we went around to the front of the building, but of course the back is more convenient.
If you like total darkness when you sleep, the Led on ac can be turned off but still runs."

The house was clean, decorated very tastefully, in a great location, and spacious. Walking distance to plenty of great restaurants and the Children’s Museum. The only struggle for us was not having window coverings or a tub. Josh was very clear and upfront about this when asked, so this was more on me to have chosen more appropriately. There were privacy coverings on the lower part of the upstairs bedrooms except for the door out to the balcony in one of the rooms. Overall we really loved the place and would stay here again if we didn’t have the baby with us ☺️"

Group trip","The home was beautiful. It was supposed to be 6 of us but ended up being 4 which was good for 2 reasons 1. There was no parking, lucky 4 of us were in one car we parked in the alley (driveway is really tight with an SUV) so if the other two came I don’t know where they would have found parking. 2, the home is beautiful but wish there would have been at least one tv upstairs because it’s so insanely quiet, or at least sound machines that would give a nice homey touch. I love the open windows but at least in the one bedroom there should be a curtain because you can see everything shining through. But overall, beautiful, great host. We got in late Sunday night so we were only in the a couple of hours but we were able to walk to get dinner before everything closed which was awesome!"

Stayed with a pet","5 stars across the boards for this gem in the Fan. Clean, quiet and walking distance to plenty of good places to eat and things to do (Try Uliveto 2 blocks away). Josh is a pro and anticipates everything with a comprehensive property and area guide. We’ll definitely be back."

Stayed with a pet","This Fan District beauty is truly a special place. It is perfectly appointed, well-equipped, and very comfortable. The back courtyard is peaceful and serene. The quaint neighborhood is walkable and full of unique shops, restaurants, and small parks. We will definitely return."

Group trip","The Airbnb was accurately described by the photos and description. It was super clean! All of the beds were very comfortable! There’s even a pack and play and diaper changer mat for the babies! The kitchen was fully stocked which made it nice to cook a meal and stay in for the night. Josh had plenty of recommendations of places to eat and things to do. Overall, great stay! Will be back!"

Stayed with a pet","This might be my favorite AirBnb that I’ve ever stayed in. Immaculate , beautifully decorated,; a wonderful renovation of an old house. I grew up in a Richmond and coming “home” for a week was wonderful with this as home base. Josh was a wonderful host and easy to communicate with. Can’t wait to stay here again.
My only small complaint is that the parking space off the back alley is quite tight to get in an out of unless you have a very small car but it was nice to have it for the few times the street parking out front was full.
The location can’t be beat in the Museum District/Fan area and easy walk to lots of restaurants and the VMFA. Only a 3 minute drive to Whole Foods. Oh yeah, and dog friendly! Winnie the labradoodle gave it a big thumbs up.
Stay here. You’ll love it."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful visit at Josh’s place. Everyone loved the details in the space (beautiful architecture, thoughtful art and accents), it was in a beautiful, walkable location, and it was spotless and comfortable. I hope to have the chance to stay there the next time we’re in Richmond and plan to share the listing with everyone I know in the area. Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the Airbnb experience that you hope for! Hands-down one of most beautiful, comfortable, clean, luxurious vacation homes that I’ve stayed in.
Communication before our stay was clear and entry was smooth. The house has been restored with care. Historic architectural details mingle with modern finishings like a renovated kitchen, brand new bathrooms and hardwood floors. The house is stylishly and minimally decorated, with no detail spared. It felt like a dream home!
The kitchen was fully stocked with anything you could need. The bathrooms had complimentary toiletries and cozy towels. Each bed was comfortable. It felt like home immediately.
We loved the front and back porches for morning coffee. There was also a private outdoor space for our kids to play.
Parking was easy, and the neighborhood is extremely walkable. Within minutes you can walk to so many different restaurants, shops, museums, playgrounds, and a Whole Foods.
Don't hesitate to book. We cannot wait to return!"
