Stayed a few nights","Cute and comfortable place with a beautiful nature view. A peaceful and private escape, only a 15 minute drive to the beach and local shops, with cute farm stands selling fresh produce along the way. This place had everything we needed and wanted for a weekend getaway. A lovely place to grill and sit outside. The bed, sofa, and recliner chairs were all super comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied and the bathroom was spacious and clean. The hosts included nice details throughout including a chess board and drinks for sale in a fridge in the connected barn."

and stay longer. It was beautiful area and the barn was such a cute place to stay. The views were astounding from the deck. 10/10 would recommend if you’re willing to try something a little different than a regular plain Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay!!!
I don’t even know where to start.
I adore that the connecting door to the house locks from the guest side, added security always feels good!
The details the host family thought of are AMAZING. Down to the settings on the Roku TV ( you input your checkout date and it automatically erases your streaming data on that date)
The towels are so clean. I’ve never been at an air bnb that I KNOW cleans their towels correctly.
The water pressure in the shower is astounding. A true treat.
As someone with a family member with special needs, i noticed the accessibility additions to the bathroom almost immediately. The weight bearing bars and plentiful room and tiled in seat were an amazing touch for any traveling families who may have wheelchair users or anyone with other mobility aids.
This is a lovely stay for anyone who is looking for a clean, quaint spot close to Virginia Beach with all of the essentials. Amazing stay."

Stayed a few nights","One of the best AirBnbs I've stayed at over the past ten years. It was so well-stocked, pristine, and well-ventilated that it seemed like I was the first person who had ever spent the night there. The bed and furnishings were very comfortable. There was plenty on hand in terms of coffee supplies, cookware, toiletries, cleaning products, linens, and household accessories like an iron and lint roller. If I had scheduled time to go to the beach, they also supplied towels, boogie boards, and a picnic basket! The owners live on the other side of the wall, but I felt perfectly at home and private. Would definitely recommend."

Norman has thought of everything. The pictures do not show how spacious this place really is. The bathroom feels like a spa, the bed and pullout couch are super comfortable and the place is stocked with everything you need. I mean everything- even beach towels and boogie boards. There are helpful notes everywhere indicating what switches control which items. And the place was immaculate.
Fantastic location in a very quiet area. This will be the first place I check when I am in the area."

Stayed with kids",This place was great! You have three floors to yourself with bathrooms on every level. Only a block away from the beach and not at all crowded as it is away from all the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk which was still only about 10 minutes down the road. The place was very clean and I highly recommend. The host was awesome too.

Stayed a few nights","this townhouse is well situated a short block and a half from a beautiful and spacious, clean beach. easy access to the water. The home was certainly clean and presentable and the host was very responsive in all communications. My only drawback about the space has to do with the pictures of the common area appearing to be larger than they actually are. additionally, there are limited views from inside the house. mostly You see townhouses on either side, giving a little closed in feeling once inside the house."

The first bedroom/bath was on the second floor and the second bedroom/bathroom was on the third floor which wasn’t an issue for our group but something to keep in mind if you have trouble with steps. The house was a shorter walk to the beach than we estimated it to be which was a big plus for us. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.

The house could use an updated mattress in the master and some new thicker towels throughout. Also, some kitchen towels would have been nice. Besides all of these minor whines we would definitely stay again. Would be a great place for a beach week with family. Lots of space."

Group trip","This is our 2nd summer at a row at The Beach House and it won’t be our last! Not only is the house more than spacious enough for our group, but if you have an infant, it has everything you need. Our son was 6 months old last year, thus 18 months this year and we loved the games, space in the master bedroom for the crib, and the highchair! We loaded him up in the provided wagon and walked the 2 minutes across the street to the beach. The place is clean and has everything you might need! Jason is a great host and easy to get ahold of if need be. He helped us find fresh seafood for our dinner and responds quickly. The 2 parking spots are clutch at well! We’ll be back!"

For example there is a sofa on the kitchen but no dinning table.

Stayed a few nights","The unit itself is very beautiful, and situated close by the beach. It was very spacious and comfortable, and could easily sleep more guests than we had (4 total). Some slight issues with bugs on the first day, but no major problems after that. Had a stranger attempt to enter the back door in the middle of our first night there, which was a little scary, but possibly just a mistake from someone at the wrong home. Would have loved to take advantage of the home’s other offerings (beach gear, bikes, grill) on our visit, but the weather was uncooperative. A severe storm (with nearby tornado) knocked out power for several hours on our final evening, and unfortunately there were no emergency supplies (flashlights, lanterns or candles/matches) in the unit, so we had to make due with our phones in the dark. Overall, it was a decent stay in a really lovely place. As someone who lives in a “smart home”, I loved the high-tech touches."

We were happy to discover that it's possible to bike along the Atlantic Avenue access road/bike path, then cross over almost seamlessly to the boardwalk bike path. We also discovered a nice bike path into First Landing State Park off of Atlantic at 64th Street. The ocean beach was a short walk away, but we also enjoyed the bay beach at First Landing State Park. For dining, we ventured twice to Tautog's, our VB favorite, and found it to be just as good as we remembered. All in all, we had a very nice time!"

It was like being in your own home with everything you might need to cook even a more elaborate meal. Beach equipment was provided as well. A smarter Air BnB with high-tech touches throughout geared towards comfort. Excellent parking with room for FOUR cars. Supreme value!"

The condo has tons of space with everything you need to be comfortable and have a good time! It’s in a beautiful neighborhood and is close to multiple grocery stores, shopping, sight seeing, First Landing state park and of course, the beach! My family and I had a blast.

Stayed a few nights","Nestled on the North side of Virginia Beach, this vacation home is a very short walk to the beach... Literally crossing the street and you are there!!! There is more privacy as this spot is located away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds, but just a 10 minute drive away from 21st and Atlantic Ave. and all the major restaurants located on the boardwalk and other great places to eat on Laskin Rd. I would definitely recommend this place. The house was clean and offered tons of space for comfort and relaxation. Loved the fact that there were no keys to pick up as the home offered up an electronic locking system where you put in a code to open the door. No more lost keys!! Cable, ceiling fans, three televisions, and 2.5 bathrooms to make sure everyone has that opportunity to use the facilities when needed. I'll definitely look for this place when I'm planning my next trip to VA. Beach."

Easy bike or drive. Parking for three cars in the drive. A duplex with 207b, so keep that in mind. Front game room can get a little noise from neighbors - but overall you can’t beat the value of this place. Fully equipped kitchen. Nice deck sitting spot. Easy beach access. TVs everywhere. Comfortable and plenty of space. Would stay again in a minute! Great communication from owner."

Stayed with kids","Great location just 1.5 blocks from the beach. You have to cross a bit of a busy street, but we did it multiple times a day with ease. Very spacious home with plenty of room for a large family. We brought my in-laws and our one- year-old son, and all five of us enjoyed our stay.
A friendly tip: bring a few cozy throw blankets with you for the living room areas - there is appropriate bedding on the beds, but the downstairs couches can be chilly when cozying up to play games or watch tv in the evenings.
Appreciate the prompt and thorough communication of the host. He even offered to allow us an early check-in. Great experience working with him.
Thanks again for a great first trip to VA Beach!"

We felt like we were on an exclusive beach resort as the visitors in this area were minimal by comparison to the southern end/ hotel area of the beach. The Hunt's rental property has EVERYTHING you may need for vacation and lots of extras including smart tvs, playing cards, board games and video games. It was immaculate, adequately maintained and well kept. We were able to walk a short distance to the beach everyday to enjoy fun in the sun. The home was even equipped with bicycles and a beach cart. All the restaurants and attractions were just a short drive away."

My family LOVED their beds and slept so well. There were also so many unexpected extra amenities and large beautiful spaces that our 6 person family could be together.
As a host, Gus was incredible! He responded in 5 minutes! He allowed us to do an early check in and a very late check out so that we could work at the house the last day."

The beds are comfy, the bathrooms are spotless, and the kitchen is well equipped. The large garage was ideal for storing our beach items and bikes. We biked to the boardwalk, went to nearby First Landing State Park, and found plenty of great spots to eat. We were a bit disappointed about the rooftop deck, though, as it did not live up to the pictures and there was no mention of the tricky spiral staircase. Nevertheless, we did manage to venture up there one evening to play games and take in the stunning sunset. Overall, a fabulous stay! Would definitely recommend it to friends. Thank you, Gus, for sharing your beachside home."

We were able to check-in as early as we wanted which gave us basically another whole day in VA Beach. There is absolutely zero to complain about. The house seems as if it was just built. The kitchen is beautiful with top of the line appliances. The microwave slides in and out of the cabinet which my 5 yr old loved. The master bedroom is huge! The deck on the roof has an amazing view. The master bathtub you can just about swim in. Guest rooms & bathrooms were beautifiul. Every single room was spotless. Famiily room was very big & had a fireplace. As soon as you walk in there's a huge closet for your beach gear. Sky light in the guest bathroom was really a nice touch. A short 30 second walk to the beach and the beach was beautiful and not crowded. Gus answered any & all questions within minutes. I cannot say enough about this house and Gus. We cannot wait to go back & stay again!"

Beach access was ideal! We came during the off season so we had the beach to ourselves and the traffic outside the house was minimal.
Gus was quick to respond! We had a hiccup with my daughter locking the bathroom door and he was super helpful, and stayed in contact until the issue was resolved!

It was also very easy to get in contact with him, and he was quick in his responses. Our time spent there was incredible, and we’re excited for our next stay there.

Stayed a few nights","Pretty place with nice view of golf course, within walking distance of Cavalier. Location is convenient to VB and Norfolk. Newport News was an hour drive due to tunnel traffic.
We used both beds and they were comfortable. Unit is very cool, with good A/C and plenty of extra linens to keep you warm. Jet noise was minimal here, and seemed to end over weekend. Didn’t use the bikes but there were one male, one female, which is good to know. Also there is a five gallon water dispenser, which was very helpful!
The only real downside is the bathroom size, which is on the small side; and the hot water takes awhile to reach you, but once it does you’re fine.
Paul was great host, very responsive and quick to address any needs or questions."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely place to stay on a fairly quiet street. Our host allowed us to check-in early, which we appreciated. It was very clean and charming. The bathroom is newly remodeled, but a bit small. It would be difficult to have two people in the bathroom at the same time. It is a great location, within walking distance of shopping areas, a grocery store and restaurants. We highly recommend it!"

We used the fireplace on a chilly night and sat outside on a sunny afternoon on the back patio, overlooking the golf course. There was coffee for the mornings, a mini-fridge, cups, glasses, utensils, and a microwave...just what we needed while on vacation. The Murphy bed, bedding and size of the bedroom were quite comfortable, and the remodeled bathroom with huge shower was great. It's a quick walk to the beach and boardwalk, too. Paul was a great host!"

Stayed a few nights","Paul is a friendly and warm host!..always quick to respond and kindly offered suggestions where to eat. We took him up on eating at The Atlantic on Pacific….excellent, especially the raw oysters, homemade cornbread and Asian dumplings. Paul’s place is within blocks of the “must-see” Cavalier Hotel. Brunch on the garden terrace was perfect. Part of the Cavalier Resort is the unique Orion rooftop restaurant which specializes in Asian-fusion cuisine and handcrafted cocktails. Paul’s studio apartment is very comfortable, immaculate, spacious, and tastefully appointed. The walk-in shower, with it’s beautiful tiles, is a good size. Paul kindly said we could park our car at the villa while we waited for check-in. He kindly texted me when the studio was ready for an earlier check-in. Loved we had a coffee maker for mornings, and small refrigerator for snacks, and drinks. Nice touch was a television in the living room, and one in the bedroom. The WiFi was strong. We used the complimentary bikes to ride the 3-mile length of the Virginia Beach boardwalk. I would recommend Paul’s place, and hope to take advantage of his lovely villa studio in the future. Paul will not disappoint."

Stayed a few nights","I’m not sure I can add anything other reviewers didn’t already say but I can say they are all correct, Paul’s place is immaculately clean, comfortable and exactly as depicted!! We walked to the Cavalier in 5 minutes, we walked to the boardwalk/beach in 10 minutes and we used the beach cruisers three days in a row. They were probably the highlight of our stay, I hadn’t been on a bike in forever! Paul is so friendly, we got to chat for a few minutes and he also checked in with us through message a couple of times to make sure we had everything we needed. We didn’t hear any noise from the other side of the house our whole stay. It felt very private. If you want a very clean, relaxed place to hang out that’s still close to everything and owned by a good person then stay here!!"

Stayed a few nights",Paul’s Villa is a charming place to relax at the end of a busy day. It is convenient to all the activities that Virginia Beach has to offer yet it is nestled in a serene location that offers verandas to unwind on with golf course views. Paul was an extremely responsive host and obviously takes pride in making sure your visit goes smoothly and that the Villa has what you need for a comfortable stay. I loved having bikes to cruise around town on since I did not rent a car. He even provided beach towels for those who are traveling light! There were plenty of towels and comfortable linens. I appreciated the extra fans for those of us who are “hot” sleepers! Great water pressure in the shower is always a bonus! I truly felt pampered. Paul reached out to me on my final day to offer me a late check out when he realized that my flight was late in the evening. He had a cancellation that day and simply thought I might need some extra time with my family. The fact that he would do that speaks volumes to the type of host/person you will be working with.

It's situated on the side of a golf course so it's quiet at night, which was great for our baby to sleep peacefully. It's also at the upper end of the beach so the traffic and volume at the immediate beach is less, which is nice. Everything was clean and as described with extra linens and household supplies. Paul gave great instructions and a nice insider guide as well. Thanks!"

We didn't walk much given the weather; it was really conveniently located for the errands we ran by car. Our Uber Eats delivery driver also found it easily. We don't usually cook on vacation, so the microwave, mini-fridge, coffee pot, and water cooler were all that we needed; Paul had a few dishes/glasses/cutlery available to use. The bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets so you could adjust to your preference. If you're really tall, the bathroom/shower might be a little cramped, but at 5'10"" it was fine for me and my spouse. Paul was also quick to answer questions. I would definitely stay there again."

Paul had amazing recommendations for the area, and his classic bikes were such a blast to ride and explore the boardwalk and First Landing State Park. The place is right around the corner from the Green Cat - acai bowls, smoothies, toast, etc, perfect for our (mostly) vegan lifestyle. All in all, a quiet, relaxing way to visit an otherwise touristy/crowded area. Only thing that would have made it better would have been a kitchen; also, like the description says, there is some noise transference between the shared wall with the main house. Otherwise, everything was great. Thanks, Paul!"

The walk to the beach is an easy 10 minute walk. Even with carrying beach items, it did not feel like a long walk.
A great feature of this place is the front porch. It is totally shaded and has comfy seating. It's the perfect place to relax, or to eat some take out/delivery if you want to avoid eating inside at a restaurant.
Paul was great with communication. He was able to accommodate my request for an early check in as well as a late check out. Those extra few hours meant for a much more full day in Virginia Beach both on the day we arrived and when we left.
You'll have a lot more space here than at a hotel on the beach that will cost the same (or even more). Plus you get access to two bikes, beach chairs, and that lovely front porch. I cannot imagine you'll regret your choice if you decide to stay here."

The area with the couch and the pullout bed was so much larger than pictures can do justice to, so we were able to leave the bed pulled out and made (which it already was when we got there, thank you, Paul!) and still use the couch and walk around freely. Both beds were super comfortable and everything was very clean. Having both the front and back porches was fantastic because if it rains the front porch is covered, and if it's sunny the back porch is a great place to sit and enjoy the weather while looking over the golf course. Paul was a great communicator, left perfect instructions for us, and responded to any and every need we had. He even provided bicycles for us to use while we were there, and gave great dinner recommendations. The location was exactly as described- two short blocks from the beach. I will DEFINITELY stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Paul was a fantastic host. The place was exactly as it was pictured, with comfortable beds, plenty of supplies, and nice places to relax both in the front patio and back on the course. He was very quick with responses, a pleasure to talk to when we ran into him, and clearly went out of his way to make our stay nice. I would recommend to anyone! Don’t forget the amazing location close to some great restaurants/bars, the Cavalier and the golf course, and the oceanfront. Great place to stay when you visit VB. Thanks Paul!"

He was accommodating, offering recommendations for local eats and activities... Even during a global pandemic, he was sociable. The place was immaculate and carefully disinfected. The location is perfect. Just a few blocks from the oceanfront and a beautiful back patio overlooking a golf course. You wont be disappointed with the accommodations, or the host. This will be my first choice time and time again during my Virginia Beach visits."

We even paid a visit to their wellness spa, The Beauty Tree, the best massages we have ever had. Scott gave excellent recommendations for food and more. Their place will be the reason for us coming back at the end of the summer. Can’t thank them enough for the delightful stay! 🤍"

Stayed one night","We stayed at Janet's place for one night. We went to First Landing State Park and the beach. Both are close to Janet's place. The beach is about a 10-minute walk to the beach—very manageable and easy to navigate.
We were mesmerized by Janet's little garden. A lot of birds frequented it in the morning as well. I'd be happy just sitting there all day without going anywhere.
The place is adjunct to the main house. You'd access it from the backyard, where you'd see all the pretty flowers and plants. The main room has a queen bed whereas the other room with a single bed sits next to the small living room and it doesn't have a door but a curtain for privacy. It didn't bother us at all, though. We heard footsteps early in the morning, which woke us up. But it's no big deal. I wanted to point these out in case you have specific expectations.
Janet provided clear and helpful information. They were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone."

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at Scott's Garden. The surroundings were absolutely beautiful ... the flowers in the property were all in bloom. The place was just what we needed ... a well appointed accommodation with a comfortable bed and enough space for our luggage and other belongings. The area around was full of local eateries. We enjoyed walking the 'boardwalk' on the oceanfront. The rip roar of the naval jets was exciting .... (at first). It did get old after over 15 flights, above, during the day ... though ... comes with the territory. I'm glad Scott recommended a hike at First Landing State Park. We hiked there for 3 hours and really enjoyed both the history and the beauty of the place."

Stayed a few nights","Utterly Charming! From the first look at photos and descriptions online to the actual arrival and experience, this sweet, cozy place just kept getting better. Our hosts could not have been nicer or more accommodating. Plenty of thoughtful snacks and hot and cold beverages available. Janet was even so kind as to loan me a treasured keepsake (signed book) when she learned I was an Edgar Cayce Fan. Scott made sure the firepit was functioning and available to keep us toasty on cool Spring evenings. The decor and artwork were outstanding and so charming, I kept waiting for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to arrive. Truly as delightful a place as one would find in a Disney fairy tale. One tiny annoyance (not the fault, by any means, of the wonderful, gracious hosts): The location is very near a naval air station, so expect to hear a lot of small planes going in and out. This didn't take away at all from a pretty darn perfect experience. I highly recommend and hope to return."

When we arrived, we appreciated the clearly labeled designated parking space. There is a beautiful, well-maintained garden that you walk through to go to the Airbnb, just as described - even in October! The Airbnb itself is uniquely decorated without feeling cluttered. We liked the fresh flowers in the vases around the space and the painted wall details in the bathroom."

Stayed a few nights","Your artsy aunt's guesthouse. This quirky little garden retreat has a surprise around every corner. You arrive through a tunnel cut through willow branches, find a small residence with personal touches from hand-painted walls to bead-lined closet entries to clever space maximiers in the kitchen and beyond. You will spend most of your time in the ""outdoor living room"" topped by a patio that stops most but not all of the rain and over which fly loud yet reassuring Navy jets (""Talk to me, Goose""). This is not a place for people looking for a beige box with stock wall art, or oversized Mediterranean villa with more square footage than taste. If you're looking for a smallish (ok, tiny) artsy-craftsy retreat in a great location adjacent to friendly folks and dogs (hi, Seaweed), this might be the place for you."

Stayed one night","Janet’s and Scott’s little garden hideaway was so comfortable and inviting! We will definitely book again. They were super helpful and responsive and the location is right by the beach and one of my favorite coffee shops, Three Ships. They had a fire going in the fire pit when we returned from our evening out with decorative lights in the garden for a super relaxing spot to unwind for the rest of the evening. The fresh tomato’s from their garden were just the little extra touch that made our breakfast a treat before we left. Highly recommended for your stay in VA beach!"

With little additions like fresh tomatoes on our doorstep to a discount at their spa. If I can’t go back I will send others . Everything had a useful purpose but was an interesting piece of brightness to the eye of thought fir the heart. I can write forever. About this crooked house and it’s owners. A must experience

The location is just a few minutes walk from the boardwalk and lots of restaurant choices. Pleasant neighborhood next to a small lake. For the most part it was quiet but fighter jets fly low overhead all hours of the day and night. If you are sensitive to noise I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The backyard is even prettier in person.

Honestly bigger then we expected and the bathroom was very spacious. It’s great for a couple and 1 child or in our case 3 ladies. The outdoor seating area is really so cute, wish it wasn’t so hot this week so we could have used it more. The neighborhood is very quiet with the exception of the occasional military planes flying over head. Janet is so considerate with the amenities inside the home from a keurig, air fryer, electric pan, beverages and even full size protein bars/snacks in the fridge upon arrival. Such an adorable place to stay and the pup seaweed was a fun bonus!"

My 4 year olds review: “This is the prettiest house eber! Look at it, it’s got a real microwave” 😊"

Stayed one night","Scott’s Garden Suite is in a great location and was very clean and inviting. I was traveling with a coworker and she found the second bedroom, which is in a small nook area, to be cramped. She’s 5’3 and said she kept bumping into the wall during the night. I would stay here again as long as I could have the bigger bed again, but she definitely would not. It would be perfect for a couple with a child. Other than that, this space is top notch."

Kara and Jessi were always just a short message away if we had questions or needed anything.
The house is on a main road, so during the weekend there is a lot of traffic making it noisy for the bedroom facing the front late at night. But that did get better during the weekdays.

The kitchen is well stocked and we felt very safe here. The home is a 3 level home. It was nice to sit outside on the front and back porch when we weren’t at the beach. The beds were comfortable and it was clean. We found extra towels and linens as needed! Plenty of hot water. We had a few hiccups (code didn’t work at check in, wifi was out, couldn’t locate pack n play) but Kara, our host, was quickly responsive and very helpful. She resolved our issues almost immediately! My only con to this house is that it is located right off a busy road (22nd st) so it is very loud when sleeping at night due to sirens and loud engines, but sound machines were helpful. Other than that, would highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids",Kara’s place was walkable to the boardwalk and provided lots to do. The home was clean and I loved the thoughtfulness of the amenities to include the organic detergent and hand soap! The home is beautiful. My only complaints are the sound of the traffic (which is to be expected being so close to attractions) and the smell of the carpet while lying down in the bed. The home is near the beach and I’m sure may contribute to the smell of mold/mildew. There were no curtains in the master bedroom upon our arrival and the microwave went out on the last day however Kara was very responsive to fixing both issues.

From the moment we drove down the long road to the heart of the property, Buddy the dog and Farmer Paul gave us a warm welcome and showed us to the cabin. The place looks just like the photos, and though small is extremely well equipped and lovingly furnished. Highlights of our stay included walking around the farm’s extensive trails during the day and enjoying the fire pit in the evening. This place is my Happy Place. Loved seeing Naomi’s shop in town, too. Fantastic wares; even better mission. Thank you for everything!!"

One of the days there were other visitors on the farm who were walking through the trails that the back porch looks out at and they were looking and watching us through the windows. All in all it was a cute place and Buddy the dog was the best. They did a great job at creating a cute home, I would just liked a little bit more privacy away from others."

Paul was the most welcoming host we've ever had, spent a lot of time showing us around the walking trails, the gardens, the orchards, the animals, the beehives, etc. with his golf cart. Enjoyed the sound of ducks and hens as a background noise for our morning coffee while staring at the little lake. We will definitely come back next year with our little daughters, I'm sure they'll enjoy the farm vibes."

Naomi responded and accepted within an hour. We enjoyed the beautiful cabin and trails. We were greeted by Paul and Buddy the farm dog. Buddy and my pup got to roam trails. He was a great addition to our stay he even slept out on the porch to keep an eye on the wildlife. I enjoyed the birds in the pond and the Victrola with great selection of vinyl. The bathroom was clean and hot water was a bonus. This was my first time booking abnb so I learned about cleaning fees and taxes so it was a bit pricey for me but I'm glad I did it we deserved a treat. It's perfect spot to enjoy quiet and listen to nature and the farm animals. Nothing like sitting on a porch with a hot cup of tea in February. I love the simple basic kitchen. Thank you so much. If we ever end up in area I would totally stay again.

Stayed a few nights","We were supposed to only book the airstream but with Naomi’s recommendation we decided to add the cabin too. It was the best decision as we were able to experience both places during our stay, they are walkable so it’s easy to go back and forth. This cabin is facing a pond where the ducks are and watching them is really entertaining. Other farm animals especially the chickens go in this area as well in the morning.
The cabin is small but has a good sized shower area and the bedroom in the 2nd floor doesn’t feel claustrophobic. There’s much sunlight that comes through the cabin which makes it brighter. Paul and Narelle made sure we are comfortable. Buddy the farm dog is the best and most adorable. Location is also about 12-15min drive to restaurants or main street/downtown.
We are coming back for sure! :)"

Stayed with a pet","This was a fantastic little property outside of Cape Charles. It's a tiny home on a lovely little pond in a super cool little farm. The goats, chickens, ducks, turkeys, and the dog Buddy greeted us every morning and evening and we're great hosts. The property is very well kept with a fun maze of trails cut out from the surrounding woods. Buddy will take you on a tour while you're having your morning coffee. It's and easy 10 min drive to the restaurants and shops in cape charles. We're definitely coming back here. Make sure to read the description before booking. It can accommodate a small family but it is a tiny home and the ladder to the loft is steep. But it's very well appointed and super cozy and cute. All and all one of the best Air B and B experiences I have had."

The farm is adorable, with goats and chickens running around; Buddy the farm dog too. Check in was simple. The cabin was secluded from the rest of the farm and peaceful, with two sweet ducks that we were able to feed from the front deck. The interior is impeccable! And so, so clean. The sheets were comfy. The design of the cabin is well thought out. Tiny details like plugs on both sides of the bed and a light switch by the bed for easy shut-off. Great curtains for privacy when needed. We just loved sitting by candle light at the end of the night in such a cozy/stylish space. Thank you for sharing it :)
Oh we also had our two small dogs with us and they loved it too. No issues at all. They loved saying “hi” to Buddy when he was roaming around."

Stayed a few nights","This converted birdwatching loft facing the pond/woods was a pleasant stay with a sense of quiet, peace, and truly wonderful and responsive hosts! We parked our car Thursday evening and didn’t get back in until Sunday, just hung around the property and totally relaxed. Three notes for future guests:
1 - Heads up, we were able to stream a movie without any real issues but the WiFi is a little weak (which is in the house instructions after you reserve). Hopefully you’re not choosing this serene property because you need to work, it would be a waste of a great experience.
2 - The farm dog (Buddy) is SUPER friendly and definitely a working free-roaming dog, which was only a challenge for us because our puppy absolutely would not go to the bathroom with Buddy around for the first 48 hours. The hosts were so understanding and helped coordinate with us so we could get our girl out while Buddy ate.
3 - FYI, if it’s bug season, you’ll have a hard time being outside without lots of bug spray!"

We arrived in Cape Charles early (about 3 hours prior to check-in at 4pm). We messaged Naomi to see if the cabin was ready and if we could arrive earlier. Naomi responded quickly and we were allowed to check in around 10 minutes after our arrival to town. Once getting to the property, we met Buddy who showed us exactly where to go.
We stayed for 5 days and truthfully, I could have stayed longer. Paul and his wife, Narelle, were incredible hosts, and honestly, truly incredible to meet and hear their stories. I would definitely stay here again. BUDDY WAS ONE OF THE BEST PARTS.
Kelly's Pub was amazing! We loved going to the Coffee House for breakfast and lunch. Definitely stop by the shop, Naomi owns -- Voiajer. Dead Rise Pizza was excellent! If you have a chance, visit the Wildlife Refuge for some incredible views.

The animals provided some pleasant entertainment as we would watch the ducks swim in the pond each night on the back porch. The cabin itself had all that two people would need for a long weekend including a record player, which we greatly appreciated as music lovers. The small details throughout the cabin like candlelights, a rustic mirror, and a vintage-looking microwave all added to the overall atmosphere of the cabin. The hosts were very responsive when we had a small concern and were also very respectful of our privacy. We did have some trouble with the smart lock working but because the cabin was out of the way from the main house, we felt safe and did not feel that this issue needed to be resolved."

I had my one year old daughter and dog with me and we spent all day just roaming through the grassy trails right outside our door. They were just covered in wild blooms and beautiful gardens left and right, it was truly a dream.
& not only were there goats, chickens tons of creatures among the land but there was BUDDY the sweetest pup that kept us company throughout our stay & made us smile constantly.
I can only hope to keep returning & make this my new home away from home!"

Stayed with a pet","First let me state that Naomi is great. We ran into an issue when we first arrived and she was quick to address the issue.
The tiny home is absolutely adorable and its location is wonderful. Laying in the bed at night staring out at the forest was great. It is so peaceful that you are able to relax. There are lots of trails for walking (it rained so it was a bit muddy, so bring shoes that do well in mud) and it was great for walking my dogs around. The place is dog friendly, no pets allowed on furntiure, which we just put our suitcase on the couch so our pups weren't tempted and the dogs are unable to get to the loft area. The people on the farm are so friendly and the farm dog Buddy loved going on our walks with us. He is super friendly and my dogs loved playing with him. I would highly recommed this place to anyone traveling to the area. Its only about 12 minutes from Cape Charles and 11 minutes from the state park."

If anything, the description and pictures of the of the cottage underplays how big it actually feels inside and how close it is to the beach and main restaurant/bar strip.
Me and my girlfriend didn’t want to drink and drive, and we’re glad to see that ubers to most of our destinations by the beach we’re typically less than $8 and we’re only a 7-10 minute drive.
The patio and view of the lake is absolutely stunning and is a great way to wake up or drink a glass of wine with dinner. 10/10 stay for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Couples Weekend Retreat!
This has been an amazing get away. We will miss the view of the water, the sky lights in the cabin, and the peaceful, safe neighborhood. Melissa was amazing! She even had a cart ready for us upon arrival so we could put our belongings and prevent having to walk back and forth when we were unloading. We highly recommend a long weekend plan because theres so much to do in the area and just being at the cabin - it makes you want to stay in and be cozy - slows down time to really help you relax. I truly hope one day we can come back!
Note: if you want to stay indoors to watch movies, bring a Roku or fire stick or come prepared with a hdmi cable to connect your laptop!"

Stayed a few nights","The setting of this cabin is beautiful. Very private with a lovely water view. Great location a short drive or bike ride to the oceanfront. But without the hubbub of the resort area. Near restaurants and shopping.
The cabin itself is a converted shed or garage. Basically one 18 x 25 foot room and a small bathroom. It was very clean. Melissa, the host, is solicitous and helpful. So there is a lot to like.
An issue to consider is the bed, which is a pull out couch. It was okay for one person for a couple of days. But it isn’t as comfortable as a regular bed. Another issue is the heating/air conditioning unit. It is a window unit directly over the couch/bed and is pretty loud. I turned it off at night.
It is a nice spot and certainly more enjoyable than staying at a typical Virginia Beach hotel."

We enjoyed our coffee there in the morning, a glass of wine there in the evening, and looking out the huge, gorgeous windows over the water from everywhere inside the cabin. The description of Serene was spot on and exactly what we needed for my birthday weekend-away. The location couldn’t be better, close to Hilltop shopping center with Target, The Fresh Market, Trader Joe’s and more, and the oceanfront is just a straight shot down the road for dining and night-life. Melissa was an excellent hostess, she checked in on us via message to make sure we had everything we needed, and gave us her contact info if we had any questions. I would recommend this stay for anyone who needs a relaxing getaway!!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! At first it was hard to believe that you actually were as close to the water as it was advertised, but indeed when we made our way down way down to this oasis the deck was but 2 feet from being right on the water! It was a picturesque view from early morning through to dusk and through the dappled light you The cabin face looking up the waterway and could see a meandering lagoon setting with boats docks and ducks. There was a gracious deck with setting to enjoy all of this and it somehow managed to be very private and quaint well still at having all of this surround of you.
The cabin was well appointed with two extremely large windows facing in teo directions both up the water way In front of you with the bed/couch face it. The side window just as large was but a few feet away from the water right there. There points when small fish were jumping etc. and at times I was surprised a place like this even existed!
Coming from Washington DC I was also happy how quiet it was and at times absolutely silent. Yet ironically literally about three minutes away from the main strip with great dining and shopping etc. and the main road lead directly to the beaches.
The owners were respectful and discrete and we did have a chance to speak to both which turned out to be a pleasure. We were treated like family and they continually inquired whether we needed anything and were ready to make our stay as enjoyable in anyway they could.
I’m going back to this solace soon perhaps just for some quiet time to reflect."

Stayed a few nights","Melissa is a great host and the cottage is cute and clean. We stayed for a weekend and explored Virginia Beach. The cottage is a short drive to everything you want to do in Virginia Beach. The cottage is private and looks right over the creek. The deck is a great space to enjoy the nature. We went on a very rainy weekend and the walk from your car to the cottage can get a little muddy - no problem when wearing shorts and flip flops. We slept in the double pull out couch and it was comfortable. Bedding and linens were all in good condition. The shower was pretty tight, but had good water pressure and was nice and hot. The kitchen was limited to a mini fridge and a microwave - but Melissa recommends so many good dining spots you won’t miss cooking for a weekend. Make sure to hike the first landing state park and go to chicks beach! Fancy drinks at the cavalier were also great!"

Group trip","Andrew was an incredible host. He was very communicative in the days leading up to/the day of our arrival. His instructions and guide were clear, concise, and very helpful.
As for the property - 5 out of 5! Very clean and accessible. I was in VA Beach for the Shamrock Marathon along with a large group (8 of us total), and we were very comfortable. All 4 bedrooms were spacious, and with 3 bathrooms in the house, there were never any issues in that regard.
The location was incredibly convenient. within walking distance of numerous restaurants (we thoroughly enjoyed Repeal as well as Barrel, both great burger spots) and convenience/grocery stores, not to mention two blocks (literally less than 10 min walk) from the boardwalk and beach.
The only concern I had was parking (we had 3 vehicles total), which is slightly limited, but Andrew gave me the heads up as well as a tip/suggested solution should it become an issue (it ultimately worked out fine).
I highly recommend this property!"

The communication continued right through to the end at check-out. The home is spacious with 4 beautiful bedrooms (the beds were amazing and comfortable), and 3 bathrooms that had everything needed including ample tp, body wash and shampoo. We hosted Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner (our son returned home from deployment) for our family and it was all made possible by having a home that was comfortable and beautiful. Our Christmas morning complete with a fireplace! Although the weather was windy we still enjoyed the awesome backyard for some air. The location perfect as it was blocks away from the beach and boardwalk, and all of the stores for any last minute things, like gas and groceries, steps away from a 7-Eleven store too!

You do have to climb a couple of floors to get to the apartment in case you have any difficulties doing this. Host asked us to walk softly on top floor as the steps make the lower floors shake a bit.

The only downfall for us was that it was a very HOT weekend and we were staying on the 3rd floor, so it was a lot warmer than I'm used too. She does provide a ceiling fan and stand alone fan, but heat rises.
Would I stay again at her place, definitely yes!

Bring an eye mask if you're sensitive to morning light coming in. Big TV with Netflix. Comfy bed. Nice big bathroom with shower only (no tub). Balcony overlooking backyard. Mini fridge, microwave, and Keurig with lots of coffee pods but only 2 tea bags. It was very hot & humid when I stayed so it got pretty warm in my room at times. A window AC in the space would be great to supplement the central AC. Overall it fit my needs for a 2 night stay and I would recommend it to others."

Keurig style coffee maker in the room, plenty of coffee was a nice touch. Was pretty peaceful, and Nataly went out of her way to make sure the temps were to our liking when we arrived.
She was also very flexible with our arrival time, and very accomodating.
We would definitely consider staying with her again when in the area."

Nataly was very responsive to our messages and assisted us when we needed help. She also gave good recommendations and was very friendly when we spoke to her. The one thing that we didn’t like was we were not under the impression that
Nataly lives/is very often at the place of rental. As this was our honeymoon, we frequently saw her when we would have preferred to have been left alone. There was also an occurrence where she rang the doorbell late at night when we were both in bed and had to get out of bed to answer the door. She was also adamant about removing shoes in the door which I could understand if it were summertime and we were tracking in sand but we were not. I also didn’t love the area, there was a nice lake view on the balcony but the neighborhood itself wasn’t the best. Overall, our stay was pretty good at Natalys and the price was very reasonable."

Stayed a few nights","Nataly's place was spotless and cozy. It has everything you would get from a hotel and very neat and clean. Also location, location location!! . The area was safe, you are like three blocks away from the beach and several restaurants. The major hotels like Marriott and Holiday Inn which are on the boardwalk are probably a lot more expensive. I recommend Nataly's place in order to save money. I had an easy check in and check out and was never disturbed while staying in her place, her family is also very quiet.
However, my only criticism is that we stayed there two days. On each day we noticed while we were gone that someone came into the room while we were out. Which I did not like because it's an invasion of privacy. I do understand that the room is in her home and not a separate space, however if she had any concerns she should have reached out."

Very responsive host - Nataly is prompt with communication. The space was very clean and nicely appointed. You have a toaster, microwave and small fridge and plates etc for use. All toiletries there as well."

Stayed a few nights","Very cute and private, lovely view of pond from balcony. Good location- close to all the good restaurants but also tucked away from crowds. Super clean and well appointed. One off-street parking spot and truly awesome suggestions from Nataly for local restaurants that fit our dietary needs. Overall it was just what we needed for a short stay.
The internet was a bit spotty one day but Nataly was quick to communicate and tried to help us resolve it immediately as I had an important presentation, and she made it work!
Only thing is to control the temperature we had use a thermostat downstairs and it took a long time to change even a couple degrees, so it was quite hot for me through the night and I kept waking up."

Stayed one night","Nataly’s top floor room was the most ideal for us compared to similarly priced hotels. We attended taco fest at the beach, and it was an easy walk. We were able to go straight up to the room which had key access, so basically it’s own apartment. The neighborhood felt very safe at all hours.
The room was immaculate! Not one speck of dust, which is always comforting and appreciated. We enjoyed the balcony overlooking the pond. The screened slider was a nice bonus. The room was stocked with more than the standard toiletries and there was a small fridge, microwave, toaster, and dishes. There was also a Keurig for coffee and tea. The size is perfect for a couple. We only stayed one night but could see ourselves coming back."

My only issue was finding my way inside after dark. I wasn't sure where the light was and finding the keys were a bit difficult. Also it got quite warm in the middle of the night and could not get the fan to work. It wasn't a problem as I just opened the window. The coffee maker and mini fridge came in handy. Check in and check out were both very smooth.

Thankfully Nataly was amazing always so quick to reply to any messages sent. Overall this place is amazing would have to definitely recommend and just if your looking for a good place to eat
