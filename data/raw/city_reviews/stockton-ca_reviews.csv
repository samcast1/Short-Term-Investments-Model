If you’re looking for a quiet clean place for a weekend getaway this is the spot. There is wifi available and two tvs for streaming in the kitchen and bedroom. Comfortable bed and pillows/blankets available. Once again, great spot and thank you to the hosts!"

Stayed one night","Overall, our stay at this container home was 5-stars. Absolutely no complaints. This place is a hidden gem in Stockton! It was so quiet and peaceful, that I could hear the crickets chirping during the day.
I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the home felt! There was a door that sectioned off the bedroom from the bathroom and another door from the bathroom to the kitchen, so there was privacy amongst other guests. The windows were mirror tinted, so we were able to enjoy the view of the large oak trees and pond without having to worry about anyone looking in.
During the day, we hung out by the pond and sandy beach-like area. The pond was so massive, it seemed more like a lake! At night, we lit a fire pit, put the lights on to the pond waterfall and enjoyed the quiet sounds of nature and water. It was quite the experience.
Shelly and Brian were an amazing host. He was very communicative with us with when we had any questions. I will definitely be renting from them again!"

Stayed a few nights",Kate has a fantastic cottage. She was so nice at check in. I wanted to stay longer. The table out front is so neat to sit out on. I enjoyed the peace of just hanging out there in front - viewing palms …even chatted w a neighbor and petted a passing cat outside …in their area and walking too - nice near the golf course and river …bed was gorgeous. Same w kitchen. Super comfy LR too ! So easy to unpack and organize w the driveway right near the door/ entry. Was going thru some family stuff (older father ) and this was perfect serenity. Can’t wait to go back.

Her communication before, during and upon checkout was above and beyond and she greeted us with a warm, welcoming and inviting smile as we pulled up. She then gave us a wonderful tour of her little cottage and yard upon arrival. The place was clean and extremely comfortable, private and quiet. The towels were as well as a nice comfortable bed were so nicely waiting for us. Everything we needed for a comfortable stay was provided. I felt right at home.
The location is in a wonderful safe neighborhood with easy access to anything needed and as well as front door parking for quick and easy access to the place.
we will definitely be staying with Kate again. We are already looking at dates and looking forward to it."

Stayed a few nights","BUYER BEWARE!
The Airbnb itself was fine, but upon departure the host claimed I damaged the faucet in the bathtub and sent me a request for $240. The faucet was slightly separated from the wall in the bathtub when I arrived but I didn’t report it because it worked perfectly.
She sent the request for more money stating the faucet was leaking.
I’ve been using Airbnb for years and never had any issues. As a mater of fact, I am very conscious about leaving the place clean and in perfect condition.
I would not choose this Airbnb again. Period."

It is truly private, not a suite above someone's living room but a separate guest house with its own entrance and bathroom. Kate was a welcoming and kind host & let us do our own thing. I have family in the area but am so glad we got to stay here as a peaceful retreat from the holiday busyness. Very nice tree-lined neighborhood as well. If Kate's place is available, book before it's too late! :)"

Stayed a few nights","Overall, I felt safe and accommodated for our 3 night stay. A friend got married at River Mills in French Camp and it was an easy 15 min drive down the 5.
This cottage is detached from the main home but you are on the same property. It's an adorable one bedroom place, well designed and simply styled.
Check-in and out was easy, Kate showed us the ropes, then left us to our own until we messaged her we were leaving.
We are tall and the bed sunk in the middle, slightly. Everything was super clean and easy to operate. I like scalding hot showers and this one definitely got hot, but not that one notch above where I like it. I likely could have adjusted the water heater since it's in the unit but it didn't bother me enough to bother."

Stayed a few nights","Fabulous! Way beyond any expectations. Kate is a dream and so is her house. I've used airbnb for many years, and this is the cleanest, cutest, and quietest place I've ever stayed. And in Stockton! I told my mom about it who lives in the bay area for a nice little getaway. (I kid you not!) Everything is high quality - bed and bedding, towels, amenities etc. I would make a special trip out to stay here anytime, and am already looking at my calendar. Seriously don't bother looking anywhere else because nothing compares to this magical place. Thank you again Kate for being a lovely human being!"

The location is in a safe neighborhood and while the weather was bad while I was there, the backyard area looked like a nice place to relax in during nicer weather. Everything in Kate's home functioned well, the kitchen was clean and easy to cook in, and the bedroom spacious, comfortable, and well apportioned. I will definitely plan to stay here again in the future and highly recommend it to anyone considering a stay in Stockton."

She provides towels, and the basics in the kitchen, I was able to cook and didn’t have to bring my own pots & pans, along with plates, cups and utensils. Everything is well taken care of. 💕Honestly, it’s better than staying at a hotel. It’s in a beautiful safe neighborhood. We loved it!

That particular hotel was noisy, the freezer didn't work, and the long-term guests had shouting arguments in the parking lot. We decided to try an airbnb in a safe neighborhood, figuring next to the Stockton Country Club should be safe. Our assumption was correct. The unit was in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Moreover, the unit was very clean and well stocked with toiletries and coffee. We'll be back the next time we're in Stockton. Thanks for a great stay!"

Even though we didn't take advantage of it, she has a lovely sitting area in the backyard she offered for our use. We enjoyed cooking for ourselves and there is a nice Safeway a short 5 min drive away. Lastly, we loved the wall AC! Thank you Kate for an enjoyable stay!"

Stayed one night","I stayed a night to break up a 16-hour drive from Eugene to San Diego and glad I chose this place. The AirBNB is attached to the main house but had its own private entrance that requires a code (in addition to the suite). As a solo female traveler, I felt very safe and had a restful night.
It was super clean and well decorated. It had its own dedicated thermostat and not some wall unit that barely cools the room in the summer time. The neighborhood was quiete, safe, and peaceful.
The bed was super comfy with crisp, clean linens. A note (for my vertically challenged friends) that it’s a bit high 😅.
The hosts were very responsive, proactive, and welcoming. I hope to book again next time I’m in town."

It was clean, roomy enough for my son and I, and private even though it’s on the same property as the main house. There are lots of restaurants and stores within a short distance which made it very convenient. The bed was very comfortable and in the morning I was thankful for the coffee available. I would highly recommend Daniel’s place to anyone wanting a cute place for two away from the hustle and bustle."

Being that this was our first time to Lodi coming from Los Angeles I was a little nervous on the drive up to see that there were just fields of corn , orchards and grapes, which was amazing to see but a little nerve-racking lol. But once you get into the neighborhood where this place is it’s absolutely beautiful. The people are so nice and kind it’s very clean and very safe. Daniels directions were so clear and he was very good about answering back to any questions that we had. Ultimately, we loved this place and we will definitely come back again."

Conveniently located between I-5 and CA99 so you can choose which route you take driving to or from LA. With a Costco for gassing up close to 99. Perfect!"

With all the difficulties associated with our trip, Issac’s home was a complete blessing. It is quiet, peaceful, comfortable, welcoming, great location, great neighborhood…..truly made us feel at home (Isaac even went to the trouble to get a grill there before we arrived- on a day’s notice). It’s hard to express my appreciation during such a challenging time. I anticipate many more trips to Stockton and will definitely stay at Isaac’s place again.
Sincerely,
Michael and Janet"

I loved being a walking distance from the university and Pacific Ave which is close to everything! My dogs had a great time walking the neighborhood and so did i! I felt safe and appreciated all the effort Isaac puts into hosting. My only complaint is the key pad to unlock the front door. It was glitchy and that was a bit stressful, however Isaac resolved the issue right away. I would stay here again. The key pad is definitely not a deal breaker for me! I was very happy with my stay. Excited to be back again next year! Thank you, Isaac!"

Stayed with a pet","My partner and I are from NV, and were in town for school purposes. Our one-month stay at Debbie's and Jose's AirBnB was exceptional. Despite other family members living with them, noise level was minimal and it is quiet at night, thanks to a thoughtful curfew. Their dog, Loki, added charm. Make sure to shut the red fence gate and check again!
The place has vibrant design with all essentials needed and even a workspace for Zoom meetings. Dedicated parking spot eased logistics.
Debbie and Jose's constant communication and kindness made the stay memorable. The location is ideal - near coffee shops, food places, and 10 minutes from St. Joseph's Hospital. Plus, it's a gateway to exciting weekend trips to cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento, all within 1-2 hours. I wish I can write more about this place (character limit 1000).
Overall, whether you are visiting for work, school, or leisure, this is an ideal place for long-term stays and experiences. We'd happily return!"

Stayed a few nights","The hosts were amazing. I would absolutely stay there again. It was a lovely little spot. I could make three minor recommendations and I'd have asked them and done it myself if my girlfriend would have let me. 1. Hand towel bar mounted next to the mirror but a minor inconvenience at best. 2. Shower is lovely but it does get slick, a nonslip mat would work wonders. 3. A brevel/air fryer. I don't want to turn on the full oven, waste of energy. Air fryer? l think it would be the perfect middle. They were lovely, the neighbors were nice and quiet. It was exactly what I wanted. Thank you for letting me stay at your place."

Stayed with a pet","Debra and Jose are always easy to communicate, they have a good taste. They have prepared a beautiful Airbnb for their guests. But l don’t like Stockton in general and l don’t like the neighborhood so much. In that street people leave their dogs free and unleashed generally, so five six dogs are wandering around free in that street and l was scared a few times because they barked at me a lot and pulled my clothes so many times so l have stressed out a lot a few times. In the pictures it seems like they have a beautiful garden but it’s currently not usable there are so many unused stuff stocked almost half of the garden.. the reason l chose the place was the garden itself but l think because of the other unit in the house the garden is not usable much. I am thinking the price is expensive for the location and the unit could be larger too because it looks larger on the pictures. Overall, l can say the Airbnb was fine, but l didn’t enjoy a lot and got bored in general."

The kitchen was well appointed with cooking equipment (rare for an airbnb). The shower was a great temperature with good water pressure. The bed is comfortable. The wifi was very fast and they have a roku for the TV. There is NO air conditioning which is listed, just a fan. Also it is street parking only, no private parking. A couple of times we had to park a block away, though generally there was a spot right in front. Lastly there is a train nearby that makes a lot of noise early in the morning. Overall it was great value for the stay."

Stayed one night","Debra is very nice and so helpful and accommodating. She left us plenty of snacks, drinks and even eggs and toast for breakfast. The place is small but nicely decorated and the kitchen is well equipped. We only needed a quick over night stop so didn’t need to take advantage of everything that was there. A well stocked Keurig was a treat as well.
The bed is only a full size if that’s important to you. The bathroom has a nice shower and everything was clean. Debra gave us advice on where to eat dinner and we went to Garlic Brothers. I wish we would have ordered a pizza but my chicken was pretty good anyway.
A large TV with streaming was great and there were books to read during your stay. Loki, Debra’s friendly French Bulldog popped in to greet us when we arrived. 😀"

The vibe inside is Marimekko/Scandanavian -nice and cozy. Quality mattresses and bedding. I’ve stayed in so many places with the worst mattresses which is why I give a special mention to these lovely beds. We were 3 adults but it is kid and family friendly. We were able to have coffee out on the back patio in the sun.
Our dog was welcome- thank you, Nhi!!
The work space was sunny, quiet, nice chair with back support and the Wi-Fi was spot on.
It is a couple of blocks off Hammer Ln which is a busy thoroughfare but minimal noise on the street.
Easy to get to Lodi, wineries, Consumes Wetlands outside of Thornton (bird watching!) as well as Stockton’s shopping and restaurants. We also visited Haggin Museum- a gem.
We will stay here again"

nicer warmer bedding, bedding had sheets and a very thin comforter for this time of year.
Teresa was responsive to my request for a blanket and a full roll of tp.& extra towels. I did not have the opportunity to meet Teresa.

Stayed one night","Overall I was pretty satisfied for a single night of sleep for a relatively cheap spot but I wanted to point out some simply things, first the bed…very creaky and uncomfortable plus the bedding was very thin so I wish there was an extra blanket (easy fix). Next the gate, this room is RIGHT past the gate yet it was near impossible to close due to its scraping the ground. I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable sleeping with it open knowing anyone could walk in and see a door right there and try and break in. The bathroom door as well is very hard to open if you’re standing at the sink, simple design flaw but with the tight space be cautious if you’re not extremely petite. My last note although out of the host control but I wish I knew, I got ZERO sleep due to two dogs constant barking throughout the night, I left at 6am because I’d given up on trying to sleep any later."

Stayed a few nights","Place was ok, but a little disappointing. The things were not really put in place for cooking food (missing cutting board, bowls). The cutting board I eventually received were the cheapest quality, whereas I feel like something better would be an investment worth making since it's something that would be used by other guests. There was an odd design with the bathroom where the mirror is positioned in a way that you see yourself in clear view when you are taking a #2 on the toilet (I don't imagine the host putting something like that in their own home lol). The location seems lacking as well (15 minutes to go to downtown or a decent grocery store, neighbor's dog barks whole day, sometimes during bedtime hours). Overall, feel like there could have been more to make the place more comfortable."

Stayed one night","Not a bad stay for a single night for a solo traveler but overall the space was too tiny, the carpet was dirty, found hair, and also a wormy bug. The space heater took some time to heat up as well. Not sure I will
Necessarily stay here again but if they make it more clean might be worth it again."

Stayed a few nights","Several good points about this place and the owner. Excellent.
BUT, sad to note:
1. A coffee maker is a standard, typical item to have at 99% of Airbnbs I've stayed at over the years.
It was missing here....plus NO way to heat up water except for the microwave.
Hmmm.....$20 is the cost for a basic coffee maker.
Before I arrived, I queried about a coffee maker, but no response occurred, despite my query of 24+ hours before I arrived. Hmmmm.
2. Few dishes to cook with at the place. Hmmmm.....
3. No chair to sit in, though plenty of room to add one.
4. Desk? Not easy to sit in a bar chair and work on a computer to do work. Adding a lower, portable card table would be appropriate, please.
Otherwise, most important: safe neighborhood....."

Stayed with kids","We got in late the first night, felt uneasy. Hard to get around vehicles and mattress in the driveway. There was an overgrown palm type plant, covered in webs/bugs which made it hard to get in the door with luggage. I had to use my phone flashlight . It looked like the pictures, but dirty & dusty. Blocked the door, secured the curtains shut with bobby pins. Stairs leading to bathroom are tile and slippery, HUGE HAZARD. My granddaughter fell and also slipped in the shower. Amazing potential, but big disappointment."

The decor is pretty mundane but it’s the essentials and bare minimum. Overall, it’s a great space because it’s private with a private bathroom, for not too high of a price. Teresa was kind enough to bring a replacement iron when the one in the room didn’t work. But there was no ironing board just the iron which was disappointing obviously."

Stayed one night","Teresa's Private Room in Guest Suite is perfect for a quick, no frills overnight spot and for those who do not want to interact in person with the AirBnB host. Privacy for her guests seemed high on Teresa's list.
The place matches its photos and is tucked away in a residential area. One would need a car to get around the area. A quick jump, onto the 5 and back off again, had us in downtown Stockton. Street parking at her place was abundant.
Teresa is quick to respond if you have any needs or requests. If you are looking for a host who is eager to interact with you in person; she is not that person. We never met her."

Stayed one night","Was not impressed with this room, glad I was only here for a quick over night stay. There were an excessive amount of flies, including dead ones, which I found throughout the room. I also found change on the floor (and crumbs). All this leads me to believe the place wasn't properly cleaned before my arrival. The AC wall unit was filthy, there were spider webs in the corners of the walls, the ""kitchenette"" was very poorly stocked- no silverware at all, only one very small pan, no salt, pepper, oil, etc. When we arrived we noticed we only had one towel, no wash rags and no dish towels. I messaged Teresa but didn't hear back from her until the next morning after I had already left. To be fair I didn't bother informing Teresa of the issues with the cleanliness because it was already a little late when I arrived and I knew I would be leaving in the morning but considering how long it took her to respond to my towel request I doubt that there was much she could have done to fix my complaints for this stay."

Stayed a few nights","Good value for the price, you get a comfortable space in a safe neighborhood in Stockton. The host is very responsive through the app and is very kind. There were only a few hooks on the wall to hold clothes, but no closet, dresser or clothes rack- so I had limited space when hanging my scrubs/business clothes as I was there for work. There is a tall window with thin curtains facing the bed which could be an issue for a guest there for work especially working overnight shift and sleeping during the day. Bed could be more comfortable, but the basics are taken care of- such as street parking, private bathroom, tv, wifi, microwave, sink and mini fridge. A great place for a couple days stay, but might be a bit of a challenge for a long term stay. Again, good value for the price, you get what you pay for."

But that is my own fault as I knew that it was just a small studio. Place was clean! Quiet neighborhood overall. Not much near it but close to the highway. Teresa is great and very receptive. Also very quick to respond!

Stayed one night","Context: we were traveling along the beautiful West coast on a 3000-mile roadtrip. We needed a simple place to warm up our hearts and souls after a long day of driving and hiking. We are simple people and expect a clean place, a warm bed and a shower, that's all. Nothing complicated.
To our unpleasant surprise, Teresa's place did not meet our basic expectations. The studio was very cold. We were at the end of December (the 31st to be specific) and, at night, the temperatures were close to freezing. When booking any Airbnb in winter, one would expect blankets and heating to be provided. While there was no blanket in sight, there was indeed a small electric heater. However, this was a crappy heater, worth at most $25 and bought at the local supermarket. Nobody should ever expect their guests to stay warm which such a heating situation. It was not suitable to heat a studio in the middle of winter.
So, we didn't not get a warm bed, but maybe we'd have more luck with the cleanliness of the place? Again, huge disappointment. The studio was not clean. The sheets smelled like they had come out of a cabin from the 60s. Some unusual objects were spread out throughout the studio. Under the bed, which we discovered after winning a battle against a huge spider (the biggest we've seen in California), there was a lot of dust, hairpins and food packagins, signs that the place had not been cleaned in a while.
To top it all off, the water coming out of the pipes tasted like it had rotten. I had never tasted rotten water before but, I swear to god, this water smelled and tasted like the pipes were rotten.
For the rest, do not expect anything more than what's in the description. The microwave is there, but we could not get our hands on even a glass or a spoon, or actually anything else that a traveller would need.
Overall, unless you're looking for a spartiate experience with cold and dusty sheets, like in the Ancient Greece, do not book this place. You'd honestly be better off staying at the closest motel."

The only thing that I would have to say is maybe a different bed but I'm a little spoiled when it comes to beds. LOL. I'm definitely going to refer people and stay again

Stayed one night","Great communication. A beautiful place in a very nice neighborhood, just south of downtown Stockton. Had no problems finding the place or parking.
The AirBNB is in a separate unit attached to the main house. It has a microwave, a fridge, an Amazon Fire TV, a *VERY* comfortable bed, and a private bathroom that is part of the unit. Everything was spotless, and there was plenty of room. The Wi-Fi was blazingly fast. There were also plenty of plugs to recharge my electronics.
The only things I could say, is that the bathroom does have a couple of medium steps that you have to navigate to go in or out. If you are a person with mobility issues, that could possibly be a problem. It was fine for me. Also, as mentioned in the listing, the unit does not have a smoke/Carbon Monoxide detector. That was not an issue to me, as I travel with my own just for situations like this.
It was a wonderful stay. I would gladly stay here again. Thank you."

The unit has its own entrance, separate from the main house, through a wooden gate on the side of the garage. Parking was no issue at all. Will definitely stay here again, and for the price, no comparison to a room in someone's house where you may run into other guests or owners."

Literally no complaints, other than wishing we could have booked for more than one night, at once. I stayed during a really hot week, so it came as a relief to find the AC was quick, and blew nothing but cold air. All basic amenities are there and provided for. Teresa did a great job in creating an overall, welcoming and cozy feel to the space!
Thanks!

Group trip","Host was great at responding to our needs. The home was beautiful as listed. There were many amenities to use but due to the weather, we couldn't use them. Would love to have the chance to try the sauna and the outdoor firepit. There were some problems with the sinks. They were all leaking and the main kitchen sink didn't work. They sent someone to take a look at it but it looked like it didn't get fixed. But we manage to be ok without it because they're two other sinks to use.
May look into more seating in the living space because there just wasn't enough seats to go around so we had to move chairs from all over the house to accommodate everyone.
Adolfo and Stevie were great. They were very responsive. As long as you communicated to them what was going on, it was fine.
Thanks for offering up your home. We look forward to next time."

Stayed a few nights","This place was pure perfection for my husband and I. Chase was very responsive with all of my questions prior to booking and I really appreciated that! I loved that upon walking in, there was a welcome sign with my name on it. Some may think nothing of this but I thought it was a nice personal touch. I absolutely loved the beautiful restroom and in particular the shower head and will be replacing mine at my own home lol The bed was super comfy and cozy. If we ever travel to the area again, we will definitely pick Chad’s place 👏🏼🙌🏼 While visiting the area I had a few work meetings and it was nice having reliable Wi-Fi that worked whenever I needed it. Stockton can be an interesting area but this neighborhood was classy, quiet, and safe."

Stayed with kids","Everything was great. Couple of nuances but not a deterrent. Very proactive, professional, and accommodating. Definitely recommend it. The hotels in Stockton are horrible. I can say this 1st hand. My teen also said, ""It was really good!""
Comparatively, I paid $100 over what I would at Hilton because of AirBnb fees, not the base house rental fee. On this trip, traveling with my son, it was worth it for the extra comfort and safety. I know Stockton well, I grew up 3 miles from this location."

We’ve stayed at multiple air bnbs in the area and nothing compares to the cleanliness and modern look of this place. I especially love the Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom!
Location is win! Our reason for going to Stockton is to move in our college kid. The home is convenient to UOP and the stores we need to ensure our college student has all her necessities.
Chase and Brooke are superb hosts! They are very responsive to their messages!"

Stayed about a week","We came to Stockton for 9 days visiting family and this place worked very well for us. It was cozy had all the amenities we needed and more. It was easy to access and, even though it is next to the host’s house, still felt very private. We did experience minor issues while there, but after contacting chase it was fixed in five minutes (what more can you ask for). The bathroom is beautiful and so is the kitchen. The only pitfall might have been the furniture/bed which you kind of sink into. The price was affordable and well worth it. My in-laws opted for a hotel, but this air b&b was nicer, had more amenities, closer to bars. And even though we stayed for two more nights than the in-laws did, we still payed less. Excellent experience overall; highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Chase and Brooke provided the perfect stay for my boyfriend and I to attend my best friends wedding in one of Lodi’s gorgeous vineyards. Stockton had everything we needed (that we admittedly forgot at home🤣) and the drive to Lodi was so short and easy it made the entire trip a breeze. I especially loved the abundance of water and water filters for two reasons. One- I am not accustom to the taste of the city water and two- we were coming from out of state 40• weather to sunny California’s 80• weather. The closet was spacious enough to hang both my huge bridesmaid dress and my boyfriends suit so we were able to go wrinkle free! I loved the guest mode on the roku tv that would automatically sign out of all my streaming services once I checked out, I’m always forgetting that. Chase and Brooke had put so much thought into every detail, they took what could have been a high stress situation for me and gave me every comfort I needed."

It has everything you need to have a cozy stay.
Everything was very clean, the air conditioning worked very well and the ceiling fan was perfect for the night that you don't need to have the place so cold.
The kitchen was very equipped and the location was perfect!
A few minutes walk to Uop and miracle mile. The place was really safe.

The Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom ceiling made for jam sessions while getting ready in the morning. I loved the “Welcome Parion” sign in the kitchen! Overall I had a great experience."

Unit very thoughtfully laid out, no noisy appliances, and everything easy to use. The location is great as it is just off of an area that has some real nice small local restaurants with very good food and reasonable prices. WiFi very good and the Roku TV control simple to use. Each day we were there we enjoyed the unit more."

Judy and Ernesto were super nice. Not only did they let us drop off our trailer, but they also told us we could check in earlier, with no extra cost. I was so happy, I almost cried. I had been up since 3 am. and could use some sleep. These are the most kindest people. I will rent from them any time.
Their house was also super clean and nice. The yard was very big. I also love that they had an RV parking."

Stayed one night",Teresa’s house was dirty and smelled of dog urine/feces including her “clean” towels she had left to use. Her place was okay sized but she was having a party and it was extremely noisy for many hours into the evening. There was also a plumbing issue where we saw someone else’s business not flushed down properly. We were willing to look past all of these things because we just needed a place to sleep in the middle of our trip but at the end of our trip when we left she tried to charge us $100 for “dirty linens” which was absolutely ridiculous but thankfully airbnb stepped in and closed her request. Also the bed is extremely uncomfortable it has a valley going in to both sides from the middle. It would be okay for a night but not worth the cost of the room

Stayed a few nights","As a business traveler, driving on the road through 8 states, I stay at a lot of Airbnbs. When I arrived at this one the first thing I noticed was the bed looked caved in in the middle. When I went to sleep, I sunk deep into it, and indeed it was dented in. I was okay after the first night but after 2 more nights my back was hurting. The side of the bed was dented in, too. I've NEVER seen a bed like this at any Airbnb. I let the hostess know 2 times about the bed and she did not respond. The room was on the cold side during the heavy winter storms. It was nice to have a refrigerator freezer and microwave. The first night I stayed there on a Friday night, there was a big loud party celebration that went till after midnight. I put ear plugs in and I was able to sleep"

Waste of money don’t go here then the b!tch tried charging me $200 for smoking in a room.. first off I paid for my night so ima smoke if I want too. It was cold as heck outside less then 50 degrees she had no heater in the room!!!! We where cold all night An heard loud foot steps up stairs all night we could hear everyone’s voices that where in that house. If this b!tch was refundable I wouldn’t have stayed at all. 💯

Stayed a few nights","This was by far one of the WORST experiences I’ve ever had with an Airbnb. There is NO AIR CONDITIONING in this unit. There is NO CLOSET as the ad stated The bed sinks down wherever you lay and I’m a 4’11 139 pound person. I imagine it would be worse for anyone bigger. Checking in was not easy. First it said there was a lockbox and to message host for further instruction. when I reached out to the host for further instruction, I got nothing. No response. This lady was disrespectful and handled my things after I asked her to please stop touching my stuff when she started throwing my stuff out of the room. She threatened to call the police because I got my dates mixed up. And instead of offering the option to add nights, she lied and said the room needed to be ready for other guests. Well I haven’t seen this place booked since I left. She stays in the room above the unit and is very loud when she’s sexually active up there (which is a lot) and you can hear everything she and her male partner are talking about unless you turn up the tv. It is very obvious they are watching your every move! She is not a friendly or helpful host at all. I imagine she just isn’t a friendly or helpful human being to begin with, I guess. But it was very difficult for me to keep my hands to myself after she started touching my things. Way out of pocket!!!!!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","My stay. at Teresa's absolutely fit my needs. I was there for 4 days with my dog while I attended a dog show in the area. This Airbnb was ideal for me. It was a very safe and accessible area right off the freeway. (N0 freeway noise.) The shower was great. The bed very comfortable for me. I found the room and bathroom very spacious with great hooks on the wall to hang things since there was no closet. I put the microwave and small frig to good use. I had to go out and purchase toilet paper and paper towels as the only paper product in the room was a partial roll of toilet paper. There are also no plates or silverware in the room so I was glad I brought a few things from home. The walls are very thin and I could hear a tv and people talking when I was home during the day, but never at night. My communication with Teresa during my stay could not have been better. The internet went down ....fixed in 10 minutes and she was not even home when I called. The electrical outlet in the bathroom was not working and she dropped off an electrical cord so I could use my hairdryer in the morning. This is far better than a hotel stay in price. I will visit again .....hands down. Thanks Teresa."

Stayed one night","I chose this place as an alternative to a hotel room. It was just what I needed for one night while traveling through town. Simple, easy, minimalist style. Check in was super easy. My only issue was the many artificial scents. There was an air freshener plugged in, and the sheets smelled extremely perfumey which made it hard to sleep. So if you’re sensitive to chemicals, be aware. The neighborhood was full of families and kids playing which made me feel safe. There’s a gorgeous green belt and path that runs through town so you can walk for miles and enjoy the perfect Cali weather."

Owner believed she was keeping up with airbnb covid protocols but I haven't found this problem in any other airbnb recently. Heat is controlled in main house.

Stayed over a week","Nice bedroom and bathroom. There’s a desk in the room, the hanging hooks worked well for hanging my scrubs on and there’s two shelves above desk you can use for clothes. There is a fan and it does get warm in the summer months but it’s manageable with the fan. I was there for almost 4 months for a contract and have no issues, the sliding door lock broke once and Theresa was quick to get it fixed.
The house is located in Stockton but it’s in a safe neighborhood and I never felt threatened or worried going out to my car at night or having the sliding door open to let air in. Overall wonderful stay and if I ever go back to the area I would definitely look into this again."

Stayed one night","The room was clean and pretty much as listed. I think they must've been experiencing hotter than normal temperatures and the room was a littler warmer than we like. But all-in-all, we were just looking for a quick place to lay our heads for a night as we traveled through Stockton on a California road trip and this space provided a good value for us. Thanks, Teresa!"

Stayed one night","Good place to sleep only. There is no AC or fan as listed. The room was very hot, even at night. Getting ready was a hassle as the room was very hot even with the door wide open. There was also not towels (or extra towels) to use so make sure you bring some. You may also want to make sure you bring a fan. This room is better for just one person to rest your head at night. The lock was very wobbly and didn’t feel very secure. The walls are thin and you can hear people on nearly every side of you"

The work area does not have good lighting either. This is more of a just sleep and leave kind of place.

Found this spot, and enjoyed a couple of quiet days in a cool space for less than half the hotel cost, and no noisy neighbors! The suite has a sliding glass door that opens onto a little patio. It's a safe neighborhood for walking and there is a nice park with a walking trail nearby. The space is comfy and relaxing. And Teresa was super nice about making it possible to extend an extra couple of days when I needed more time. Bookmark this one!"

I had no idea how long or how often it would occur. I advised host I was uncomfortable with the noise and arguing and was deprived quiet enjoyment. Host refused to understand my reason for leaving and chose to adhere to a written policy regarding cancellation refunds despite my reason for leaving was due to her. I’m very disappointed in her.

Don't expect to find any extras that you might need during your stay. It's literally a place to sleep & shower (bring your own blanket & towel)."

Stayed about a week","I usually like to check-in when it is still light outside, but I ended up getting here fairly late in the evening. That said, I felt totally safe in Teresa's neighborhood and really appreciated that the walkway to the sliding door of the room was well lit, and the side gate was propped open. This place has all of the basics in terms of a bed, lights, desk area, computer chair, outlets, bathroom and even a microwave and mini fridge. I used the microwave, but not the mini fridge. Some of the outlets were non functioning, but it wasn't a huge problem because I always had enough working ones to plug in my laptop and cell phone. There's no closet space or hangers, but there are hooks near the bed and over the bathroom door that made hangers unnecessary. Teresa was a great host and messaged me about where to find the key on my first day. She also messaged me to ask if it was too hot and if I needed air conditioning which was very thoughtful of her. Even with the hot weather, I never felt uncomfortable. This was a much better experience than what I would have gotten with any of the hotels in/around Stockton - definitely recommended."

Stayed one night",I've stayed here before a couple of times and I've never had a bad experience. everything is as described and And I normally have a great stay. this time not so much. whoever was staying next door to us was extremely extremely loud and the walls are paper thin. even at a whisper you could hear the people next to us. I did not make a complaint to the host but I did leave within about 3 hours of being there because I felt that uncomfortable. give him the fact that the tenants were already there I couldn't necessarily ask them to be quiet cuz it was only like 8:30 or 9 but it was just not my cup of tea. normally again it isn't like that but this time it was bad enough to where I was only there about 4 hours max and then I left shortly after sundown and didn't come back till the morning together my things

The walls are definitely thin and so i would highly recommend keeping it down by 9-10pm. We had a bit of a noise situation but Flormaria was quick to address it and was super accommodating to the situation of noise from a neighbor at 12am. There is ample street parking in addition to parking infront of the garage/side of your unit. Clear instructions and i would definitely book again!

Stayed one night","Stay was good, AC was leaking a lot every time we would turn it on there would be a huge pile of water, we had to put a bucket underneath of it. She was communicative and would come drain the water out. But if your over the age of 21 and you have marijauna make sure to keep it put away. I didn’t smoke in the room but flormaria thought I was because of the smell it left from being out, and was wrote a bad review on my page because of it."
