Stayed a few nights","Kendall yards is a great area of Spokane with great bars and restaurants along the river. Erin’s place was a 5 minute walk to all the restaurants and bars.
The space was really nicely renovated with a simple layout and no clutter which I really liked. Lots of space for 4 people and had all the amenities you needed. Would definitely use this place again."

Stayed a few nights","The airbnb is very charming and full of character inside. Erin was really quick to respond to any questions I had. The location is great for walking to downtown or to Kendall Yards. The only real downside was the parking, which is nonexistent during a few days of the week. You can tell the bowls and mugs are well loved and ready to be replaced."

Stayed with kids","We rented the house for our family (2 adults and 2 teens). The location was amazing in terms of walking locations - easy to downtown, river walk, coffee, a few restaurants, etc. It’s an older neighborhood that looks to be going through a revitalization. I was a little nervous when I saw people waiting in line at a community center across the street in the morning after we arrived. But I never felt unsafe or nervous walking around the neighborhood on our own day or evening. The home is older (1898). Lots of creeks and cracking walking around and only one bathroom. The charm is lovely and something different than what we’re use to. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks!"

Would go back in a heartbeat. There is a pretty steep and windy staircase that is harder for older folks (especially in sock feet), but that is well-noted in the description. Loved it!"

Stayed a few nights","Erin, Rocki, and Dani - super responsive and friendly hosts. They have created such a cute, comfortable and charming house. We loved having access to a kitchen, refrigerator, and washer/dryer. The location was very convenient to visiting downtown, and also the Gonzaga campus. Like any city living, just be aware of urban challenges - while I was walking my dog on the 1st day of our stay, in broad daylight, a block away I watched a guy walking in the side of the street, going from car to car trying to discover which cars were unlocked (none seemed to be). Again, like living in any other city, do the common sense things...lock your car doors, and don't leave exposed stuff visible to passersby. We never felt unsafe here. The neighborhood seems very quiet and peaceful. Overall, we felt very safe walking around. Erin, Rocki, and Dani clearly have worked very hard to make their AirBnb a wonderful place to stay - and it shows! Hopefully, we will be able to stay there again"

Excellent communication throughout our stay and when we noticed the faucet for the shower and tub wasn't working, Erin had someone quickly come and replaced the tub and shower fixtures in under an hour on a Saturday Evening!
Shower was awesome and we felt at home during our stay! We will definitely come here again when we go to Spokane!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was nice. We liked the decor—it felt like an actual person had put their personal touches there instead of just a bunch of mass produced art. The black couch was comfortable but the two grey chairs and the dining room chairs weren’t very comfortable. The beds were quite comfortable. The stairs up to the bedrooms are steep and a little difficult and the bathroom is not on the same floor as the bedrooms so if you have less mobility this would be a hard place to stay.
There was a lot of artificial scents and cleaners used in the place so if you are scent sensitive I would steer clear of this one.
Overall good stay, easy to get in and find!"

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I stayed here for 3 weeks while waiting for our new home to be ready. Everything went great. The location was super convenient to everything. I loved being close enough to the rail trail to walk my dogs there daily. The stairs are steep, but I got used to it, and my 12yo stepdaughter had no issues. But I wouldn't recommend for small kids or anyone with mobility concerns. The house is very old but has been nicely remodeled. The old, thick lath and plaster walls ensured Ibarely ever heard neighbors. We would definitely stay here again next time we need a place in Spokane."

It had everything we needed for a 3 day stay, but we could have been comfortable for a month! There was little street noise and no noise from the other apartments. The water pressure was good and the heating/cooling system worked well. Elevator or stairs option was a good perk. Bad timing for the Original Pancake House being closed for remodeling- LOL. But other than that I recommend this to anyone!"

Stayed a few nights","This space was a beautiful, welcoming, cozy, well-appointed home away from home. I really loved staying here. It was even better than how it looked in the photos (although the photos were good). The cost was surprisingly low and I expected there to be a reason for that, but found none (maybe the market in the area?). I spent more time in than I had planned on my trip to attend a conference because it was so nice. I was especially grateful that there was a regular coffee make and not the super wasteful K-cup coffee service, and also environmentally friendly, refillable shampoo/soap/conditioner dispensers. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Spokane, Jake!"

The location was close to the theatre as we were in town for a short stint for work and his place was a calm resting place. Many people in our company were able to find accommodations here. Only issue was a neighbor who played VERY loud music every morning around 7am for about two to three hours. No idea who it was but it woke us up daily. Other than that the place and space is highly recommended.

Stayed a few nights","Everything was just as advertised. Clean apartment with easy access and good amenities. I wasn’t there long enough to do any legit cooking but it seemed like a well outfitted kitchen. The laundry worked great.
Split AC/Heat needed additional instructions since it sort of had a mind of its own upon arrival. Once set to “A” for automatic, it seemed to manage temperature well.
Parking was convenient on the street outside via the meters and FREE between 7pm-8am M-S. I HIGHLY recommend using the app so you can add time as needed but the 2-hour paid limit is an inconvenience. I don’t know what the parking authority was thinking when they deployed these meters. The lot next store is 24-hour paid but odd durations. Again, no fault of Jake’s. Just something to be aware of. Definitely recommend the spot for convenience to all things downtown Spokane."

Overall, she was a great host throughout our stay. We felt very welcomed and relaxed. The home was beautiful and very clean for my immunocompromised wife. Our children loved the property and our stay was more than amazing. Thank you, Kaelin!"

Group trip","Fabulous stay and incredible hosts! House is really cute, beautifully decorated with very comfy beds, huge closets, stocked with everything you need in the kitchen (& modern, matching dishware), a great yard, and very easy in and out access. We were there on a very hot grad weekend and really appreciated the AC and nice cool rooms! Kaelin also decorated with cute grad sign/confetti, and provided lots of great treats and drinks which was a nice touch. There were a couple of minor bumps when we were there that were out of their control but host was quick to respond and deal with the issues/offer a solution - all hosts should take notes from Kaelin! Kaelin was also very flexible with our check-out time which was really helpful for us as several had work meetings to do before flying out. Would definitely stay again if in the area without our dog."

The kitchen was well stocked and Kaelin even left snacks, drinks and a bottle of wine. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We loved the two stories because we could all spread out and be comfortable. It was very close to restaurants, stores and a grocery store. Kaelin was very responsive and helpful. If we are ever in Spokane again, we will definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Such a great place! We booked last minute because the place we had originally booked ended up being much less desirable than it was described online. We were so grateful for Kaelin’s place! We ended up canceling the other Airbnb and were so grateful to be able to have a better experience here. Kaelin‘s house was beautiful with gorgeous newly renovated interior design elements. It was so clean and comfortable. They added all the nice touches, including plenty of towels, everything we could possibly need. Every detail was perfect down to the gorgeous new refrigerator, beautiful wood flooring, lovely rugs, clean sheets and comforters, a first aid kit, toys for the little ones, and they even had a desk for my husband to work from home one of the days."

Stayed with kids","This was our first airbnb and we were a little nervous, but upon entering the home I could not have been more impressed. EVERYTHING was organized and clean. Labels told you everything that you would need to no and had anything and everything you could want. I was able to cook meals for the grandkids we went out to see, and not spend a fortune on dining out every night. They had a little kids nook which was great for them, TV had any and all you could possible want, and a lot of little extras I simply was not expecting, like a few things to drinks in the fridge and a couple snacks so we could just relax after the long trip there. I would recommend them with my whole heart. Will be using them the next time we go out to see the kids as I simply could not have asked for more. HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!!

-away-from-home, if you need a place to stay in Spokane. Was perfect for our family, beds were very comfortable, nice linens, and Kaelin has the house perfectly stocked. She went so far as to even have a welcome basket* of snacks and goodies upon our arrival. Perfect layout with the master upstairs, and having the kids sleep downstairs, they even had their own separate tv area and kids corner.

Group trip","Sadly a group of us friends rented this place because we were in town for a funeral. Kaelin/host heard of this and left a heartfelt note (along with snacks). The place was incredible clean, bright, and with tons of thoughtfulness (chargers, night lights, supplies, wifi notes, etc). The beds were cozy, the hot water instant, and the coffee supplies were 👍🏼 (our main priorities!). We rent a lot of airbnbs as a group, and hands down, we all said we want to stay here again. Thank you Kaelin not only for your wonderful space but offering your kindness/care to our group."

The layout of the house was perfect for our six adults and a one year old, with two lounge areas to hang out in, a wonderful outdoor space, and a super functional kitchen. The kids corner downstairs was so cute and such a hit! Kaelin and Luke were so accommodating by helping us make this a home away from home. They made sure all the toys were appropriate for our baby’s age, added some baby proofing and a baby gate on the stairs, and included a pack n play for bedtime! The attention to detail was so impressive! We had everything we needed from hand soap and extra towels/blankets to snacks and cold waters left in the fridge for us. Just book it!"

Location was great with a store less than 5 min. away in any direction. Simple style and clean décor made the stay easy and refreshing. Neighborhood is sweet and east to navigate. Will keep D Street on our list for return trips to the area.

They kindly thought of leaving spaces in kitchen cupboards and large bedroom closets so we could be organized and keep snacks safe. We also appreciated the kids area downstairs and other fun activities. The location in West Spokane really worked for us being near friends and shopping. We could really relax in our home away from home. Thanks."

Stayed a few nights","The ""D-street Retreat"" was great. Exactly as described, well decorated, and great overall space. Kaelin is the perfect host and refreshing to stay with an owner/operator rather than a corporate manager. She was super responsive, reasonable, and very helpful. The kitchen is well stocked, backyard is cute, and the house is well furnished and comfortable. Everything worked, wifi was fast, and ac great. The only caution I can think of offering is that the beds are firm which I personally prefer but may not be everyones cup of tea. Overall fantastic stay, even better host, and would absolutely recommend!"

Stayed with kids","This home was beautiful and clean. We felt very safe with the security system in place. There are several cameras around the outside of the home and safety alarms on each window and back entrance of the home. The kitchen, laundry closet and restroom were fully stocked. All we had to bring for our stay was food, but our host did provide a complimentary bottle of wine, coffee and snacks. Airbnbs like this one have been a game changer for our family. It was conveniently located near a variety of child-friendly activities in Spokane, but also a short drive to Coeur d'Alene and Silverwood Theme Park. After we visited the water park I was able to use the full washer and dryer to get our clothes cleaned up for the remainder of our trip. The host even provided pods and fabric softener dryer sheets. They also noticed that we were traveling with an infant and provided a pack n play. We fell I love with the finished basement which we used as a playroom during our stay. There was a variety of toys, chalk board, and board games for our young travelers. There was also a big back yard for them to run around and get their wiggles out. We all felt very comfortable during our stay. Having all of the amenities that the host provided makes it much easier to travel with young children than staying at a hotel. I would highly recommend this home to anyone visiting Spokane or Silverwood Theme Park."

Stayed with kids","This home is just the cutest! We came to visit our nephew who plays on the Spokane MiLB team, and it was the perfect spot for all of us to be together! It is so well furnished that we had room to relax in one of the two living rooms, work the puzzles that were provided on the large dining table, cook meals together, play corn hole in the back yard, and even grill out for lunch one day. The beds were extremely comfortable as well as the additional floor mattresses that were provided. The shower had great water pressure, and the kitchen was set up very well for cooking. Thank you for a wonderful stay! Can’t recommend this home enough!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is as amazing as it looks! It is furnished beautifully and the hosts thought of everything to make our stay incredibly comfortable. We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived, - greeted with a handwritten note, snacks a cold beverage in the refrigerator. The kitchen is well stocked with plenty of dishes and we were delighted by the coffee tray that had everything we needed for our morning drinks. The primary bedroom is cozy and the charming walk-in closet has plenty of room to spread out, with 2 luggage racks to hold our suitcases (luggage racks may be a seemingly small but very much appreciated detail in every bedroom there!) The bed was comfortable and there are outlets on each side of the bed for convenient phone charging. The rest of the home is just as welcoming and comfortable, and the backyard is also a well-kept and beautiful space. I can't say enough good things about the hosts who were very responsive to our questions prior to booking and while we were there. We plan to return to the 'D Street Retreat' when our travels bring us back to Spokane. Thank you so much Kaelin!"

I like a firm bed and this one was borderline not too soft so I think it would work for any ones taste...soft to firm. it's the goldilocks middle. Nothing is fine....but look what you're paying....and not a single thing is sub-par! Great place, host and dog....worth every single penny and I would stay again. (iy should be noted I'm pretty picky so this is a glowing reccomendation!)"

I felt that the instructions were clear and thorough, and I enjoyed the ease with which I was able to check in and out. I also felt that I was offered privacy and autonomy as the building was very spacious and quiet.
My only concern was that I wasn’t able to lock my door from inside my room - which left me feeling a little uneasy through the night as there were other guests staying in the same floor.
Overall I had a very positive experience."

Instructions were very clear and he is very organized. Everything was clean and tidy, nothing to complain about. I wasn't there long and didn't use the kitchen but it looked clean, nicely minimal and tidy. I think it was properly priced as well.
My room was one of three located upstairs, each room has their own key which is great, also an adjustable thermostat (I get cold easy so it was nice to adjust warmer than the house). There was a convenient desk with a USB charging dock and chair, a dresser, big closet, small fridge nice and cold, few water bottles and snacks. perfect.
Bed was decent, not hard at all, not a sleep number but perfect for a quick stay.
Momentarily the neighbor dog barked for a few minutes, quick and done and not a bother. Plenty of parking. Would stay again."

Stayed one night","This place is a gem.  It was our 2nd stay. (A few days ago we stayed in a different room when we were 2 +1) This time it was just my husband and I traveling so we stayed in this 'butterfly room'. We were thrilled to be able to stay again. 
Our host Asa was very thoughtful in providing information in his listing so we knew how to plan for and use the stay. We did get to visit briefly with Asa and meet his dog. This is a great value with no unpleasant surprises.
The old house is nicely updated, spacious and spotless.
Our quiet upstairs bedroom was nice and spacious with a comfortable bed. Already, the window AC had the room cooled. The little refrig was on and a welcome basket w/bottled water & pretzels were waiting. The hallway bath is nicely updated and stocked with essentials a traveler may need.
We used the equipped kitchen to warm-up a light dinner and ate in the dining room.  At breakfast we were able to make coffee and enjoy our muffins at the table."

The house is located on the South Hill close to wonderful coffee shops and restaurants. We cooked dinner for our daughter and her fiance while visiting them in Spokane. Janine's kitchen offered us a well-stocked assortment of pans, including my favorite--an iron skillet. This arbnb had such white linens, towels and sheets. Janine should be a mentor to others who take on this very important skill of hospitality! We will book again!"

Stayed a few nights","Janine was a gracious and hospitable host, and was there for everything that we might’ve needed. The house was cozy and beautifully furnished with antiques and lots and lots of handmade Stainglass. The only issue was, it was on a very busy major street and it was hard to get in and out of the driveway and often was hard to find on the return trips as it was surrounded by larger homes and way back on the property. The location was great. Otherwise, as it was just a few blocks away from the Manito park. Janine left us a bottle of sparkling wine, but we didn’t even get a chance to use it, but we’re very grateful for the consideration. If we ever need an Airbnb in Spokane, we will definitely check to see if she’s available."

It was 20 minutes from our family in Spokane Valley and 25 minutes to the wedding venue in Post Falls, ID. The stain glass and artwork throughout the home is stunning! Janine suggested The Chalet up the street for breakfast and it did not disappoint, great food and service. I was very thankful for all of the items she has available for use in this Airbnb as I forgot my entire back of toiletries in Oregon! If you have allergies to pets, this is the place for you. My family has pet allergies and we had zero issues. The only thing to be aware of is you back out of the driveway onto a fairly busy road. You can hear a bit of road noise at night, but other than that we had a great stay and will book this Airbnb when we visit family again."

Stayed a few nights",The Stained Glass House is a very nice place to stay. Janine was a welcoming host who was so attentive to anything we needed. She even shared some home baked muffins when we arrived which were wonderful. The beds were very comfortable and we loved the decorating style of the home. It was clear to me that Janine loves being an Air b and b host and it shows in the personal touches she has made to make people feel welcome and at home.

The two bedrooms were very comfortable and we got a good nights rest there. The bathroom was clean and had all the necessary accoutrements.
The furnishings and the decorations all over the house make this place a unique getaway. We loved discovering the unique collections of items that Janine has put a lot of thought into decorating. We will not hesitate to stay here on our next visit to Spokane."

Then there are so many other things to look at and enjoy while there. The home is small enough to be cozy for two, yet can sleep four, and it is big enough to have our family come and play games and visit and have birthday parties. There are nine of us. This was our second visit and we plan to come back here anytime we come to visit our grandkids or have doctor appts. Janine is a lovely person and a great host. Her prices are great as well. annie"

I would say the list of rules are can seem like a lot but really if you were renting your house out you would want the same thing. All simple things and easy to follow.
The location is great being so close to everywhere you would want to go. Easy access to downtown area and there is a beautiful park literally across the street from the house and down the block. It is on a main road so you will hear cars going by.
I very much enjoyed my stay at The Stained Glass House."

I would definitely stay here again!
I took the bus line to and from this location and felt it was easy to get to. I think the longest walk I had. To a bus stop from the unit was around 15 minutes, which isn’t too bad. And once you’re on the bus, you can get to most places around Spokane."

Stayed one night","Kate is a fantastic host! I have stayed with her two times. She is very responsive and welcoming. The space is very clean, organized and inviting. The beds are comfy and I feel open to use the kitchen and common space, despite it being shared with other guests. It is clear that she puts in effort to make help her guests have a great stay. 5 star, definitely recommended!"

Place was easy to get to and accessible to everything Spokane offers (close to airport, downtown, restaurants, breweries, local attractions). Host instructions were very clear, made the check-in/out process very easy and made for a comfortable stay. Private room was well furnished (tv, work desk, massage chair, comfy bed), felt like I was at home. Looking forward to staying here during my next trip to Spokane!"

Additionally, you get a great balance of being away from noisy main roads, but being minutes away from grocery stores, fast food, and the mall. Quiet and safe but convenient!
This is the one place where not only do you get all the above, but you have a safe haven to arrive at. Each time I stay, I feel safer than the previous time."

Kathryn's business model reminds me of the old days of traveling overseas when BnBs were simple, comfortable and reasonably priced.
I wish more would follow her example because it's the right way to do business and contribute to the traveling community.
I appreciate all the little extras, like the cool jazz/bebop playing in the background whenever I used the kitchen. The cast-iron frying pan and Lone Wolf dinner ware. The quality of the bathtowels and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!
I'm gonna miss the bed and the massage chair!

From the street, the house appears a modest mid-century. Looks can be deceiving.
Kathryn has obvious thought carefully about how to make her guests’ stays as welcoming & comfortable as possible.
The interior of the house has been modernized & tastefully decorated. The kitchen is fully-equipped & well-stocked with little items for her guests.
My room was lovely. Quiet with a spotless private bathroom and lots of storage. Kathryn has cleverly made every square foot of a small space work without making the room feel small. The bed was great. I slept like the dead.

Contrary to what Kathryn writes on the listing, no restaurants or bars nearby: in fact, she recommends restaurants and bars at least 2 miles away! The unit is not well maintained: cracks on the floor and on the walls. and yellow bathtub joints. Be careful, you sleep in a cellar… Bric and junk furniture. The souvenir is not good. I don't recommend this place even though it's inexpensive. Disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","If you like youth hostel vibes this is your place to go. It is an almost finished 1 bedroom basement suite. Finished with flooring would have been a definite plus as the concrete can be chilly. Upon arrival the instructions for entry were very good. And virtually every aspect of the property is labeled with miscellaneous notes, warnings, rules and price tags. The property feels very commercialized rather than comfortable and homely with the excessive amounts of warnings plastered everywhere (sink, toilet, tv, window etc.) This is not the best area of town, however the price is reasonable compared to a hotel. The staircase leading downstairs to the suite is very steep. If you have mobility issues look further. There is only 1 small window in the basement (also labelled with rules). Other than that the bed was comfortable, the room was clean quiet. Overall it was pleasant for the price."

I made lunch at the shared kitchen while Kathryn was working from home and it was nice to have such an easy going conversation with her. I don’t usually stay at airbnbs that have the host living in them but this felt so nice and welcoming specially while traveling alone. Thanks for letting me stay at your place!

Stayed a few nights","I think the title “suite” is misleading.
This is in a cold basement, step uneven stairs.
The floor is just painted cement and your feet were always dirty just walking to the bathroom and back. There was a small “sink hole” of sorts next to the bed that just had a pile of furniture rubber pads in it.
Poor quality furnishings - the kitchen floor was SO DIRTY I was so grossed out. The same dirty dishes from the other guest in the sink my entire stay. The pictures of the living room are deceiving - the door to the living room was always closed and the one time I opened it, I realized there was just a curtain separating the other “bedroom” VERY small not worth the price.
The heater that’s provided in the basement is something I would use under my desk not something meant to heat a room - I left it on and set at 86 and it was still always cold. The lack of laundry is inconvenient - there’s laundry but it’s behind locked doors that say staff only. I was disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","This airbnb is probably one of the nicest, most affordable airbnbs in the Spokane area. It is in a quiet, safe neighborhood, not too far from anything you’d want to do around town. It was private, quiet, cozy, and felt just like you would feel at home. There’s even a fan, and a white noise machine, as well as a flat screen TV right in front of the bed with access to streaming platforms as long as you have your own log ins to them. The bed was super comfy, with really nice linens, the bathroom was clean and very nice, and there’s even a desk in the room if you need to do any work. There is another suite upstairs, however you can’t even tell that other people are staying up in the other suite. Your suite also includes a key so that you can lock your room while you’re not there. There is a kitchen with an honor bar/store in case you want a drink, or forgot any items at home. I chose not to use the honor bar/store this time around, however I definitely will in the future! There is fridge space if you want to bring your own groceries, and she provides coffee for you as well in case you want coffee during your stay. The check in and out process was super easy and stress free. There’s a lot of parking available that you can choose from. She also includes a binder with tons of information if you’ve never been to the Spokane area. 10/10 would recommend this airbnb!! Thank you so much for the lovely weekend getaway Kate!!"

It was quiet at night and had fans, heat and lots of windows to make it comfortable at night. Many of my son’s teammates stayed in local hotels downtown for much more money and had loud street noise and neighbors. Jake’s was very comfortable. I would have given 5 stars in all categories except we found dust and debris in the foldout bed and we couldn’t initially find towels. They were all in the dryer. All in all, this is a great place and very comfortable for a family of four."

Stayed one night","Super frustrating experience…we had been traveling for over 24 hours and were extremely tired. I reached out to Jake to ask for an early check in and was told he would speak to the cleaning service and get back to me. I never heard back from him so I assumed that it was a no. We waiting near by for 3 hours to check in and then walked into a filthy apartment. Jake had never reached out to the cleaning service even when I specifically ask for early check in. We ended up finding a hotel that was over priced, but still had room. At the end of the day don’t tell your customer that you’re going to do something to help with when in fact you’re just giving lip service.
Side note: the cleaning service reached out to me and apologized and said that apartment was not on the list to clean. They even offered to help me find accommodations. I never got a call from Jake the host of the Airbnb, not professional."

Stayed a few nights","The loft is very close to Gonzaga University, which is ideal. Finishings and layout were quaint and thoughtful. I slept great. The bed was very comfortable and I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was despite being surrounded by student apartments. Off-street parking was great for 1 vehicle.
It’s evident the cleaning company for this unit has cut corners that did make my stay less comfortable. In the bathroom, there was no bath mat, hand towels, or extra toilet paper. In the kitchen, there were no paper towels, the coffee pot had remnants of grinds from the previous guest, and the sponge in the sink had been previously used. I also wonder if perhaps the people who have access to the garage below the unit smoke in there because every now and then, there was a faint cigarette smoke odor in the unit.
Despite the cute unit design and location to Gonzaga, I don’t think I would stay here again."

There is no dishwasher and I didn’t have anything to clean the dishes so I had to go out and buy a sponge. Before I left I let them know the bathroom sink wasn’t draining well.

Stayed about a week","I was there because of visiting my daughter, student Gonzaga. Location is perfect. Great neighborhood. Walking distance to the “Kennel”. Easy parking in the street. Homely apartment, good for alone or with 2 people. The (sleeping) bank has had its best time, so would not use it quickly as an extra bed for the 3rd person.
But enough to watch TV. Hope to have a choice! In short; Would definitely go here again!!!"

Not great neighborhood, woke up a few times in the night to people yelling in the street. Keurig coffee maker but no K-cups and the water tasted really gnarly out of the tap, they should probably invest in a Brita."

Park near by if you have small children which was a plus for our family. The only down fall was the size of the shower. It was too small, it was small to really move around and shave my legs. If you are tall, my husband is 6’2” and barely fit. For comfort we would consider something else. Overall highly recommend."

Stayed with kids","While this was a very convenient location to stay either for those associated with GU or traveling through, this was not a place we would choose to stay again given the value of what you get for the expense. It was generally nice and communication and directions were not a problem, but there were some issues with cleanliness and comfort. Guests should note that, if using the air conditioner during hot days, it is very loud (will wake up even somewhat sensitive sleepers) and the couch is not particularly comfortable. While the space would do nicely for a couple of people and for those primarily planning to eat out, the kitchen is not very well stocked for those wanting to make their own meals. For a place costing over $300/night to reserve, we expected a very clean/spotless space that didn't feel like it had cut corners."

We weren't sure they would have coffee grounds so we brought our own, but they did have coffee grounds and kcups, as well as a drip coffee maker, french press and a Keurig. They only had oil, salt and pepper for seasoning, but had pots, pans, tuberware and baking sheets so we were able to cook our food. Overall, the cleanliness was great, the space was decorated well and was welcoming and looked exactly like the pictures."

Of note, the area isn’t the greatest and it can get quite loud at night since it is in the college area. It’s great if you’re just in town to come-and-go but not the best if you’re actually looking for a nice area to enjoy Spokane. Other than that, it was a wonderful stay and I would definitely consider booking again."

Stayed one night","Worst Airbnb stay ever. Do NOT waste your money here. Frustrations. Freezing cold. NO Wifi.
The listing mentioned two parking spaces. When I arrived after dark there were already two spots in the driveway. I ended up parking my car behind one of the existing cars, worrying I'd blocking someone in. As the rear of my car hung into the street and covered the sidewalk.
Then I'd not been given an access code, so I waited 30 minutes in my car until someone responded with an access code at 10 p.m.
Upon entering the rental, it was super cold. I attempted to turn on the heat. Neither of the heaters worked. When I messaged about it they said they'd check into it. I touched base with them back and forth over the course of a couple of hours (because it was honestly too cold to fall asleep.) They kept apologizing but did not provide a solution nor send someone to fix it.
Meanwhile, I attempted to connect to wifi using the info provided in the wifi tab under the trip info in the app. I was unable to connect to wifi. When I asked about this they said they'd look into it.
I looked for tea to possibly warm myself up. There was only coffee, contrary to what the guest book said.
I eventually piled every blanket I could find onto the bed and fell asleep after midnight. Shivering.
In the morning I received a message sent around 7 a.m. telling me to check the breaker to fix the heat issue. And telling me where the breaker was. Once I flipped the breaker the heat did come on. But it never really warmed up until checkout time.
This morning message also included completely different wifi information than was in either the wifi tab or the paper guestbook in the rental. I attempted to log in with this wifi info and it still didn't work. (After I left the rental I went to a local coffee shop and was able to access wifi. So I know the issue was not with my laptop.)
Additionally, it was clear I was not speaking with someone local in the messaging. I basically received tons of apologies and almost no solutions to all of issues. I later discovered the property is managed by Guest out of Israel. I'd wondered by the way the responses came in. There was clearly a language barrier.
Beyond this, there were tons of black fingerprints on the inside of the entry door. Several large black stains on the living room rug, a broken oven handle, no bath rugs/mats in the bathroom, the kitchen sink was dirty and sticky upon arrival.
I'd estimate I spent about two hours out of my six hours of awake time at this property messaging and reaching out for solutions to the issues at the property. With no satisfaction.
To compensate for my time and inconveniences I asked for a refund of either the cleaning fee or the one night of stay. I received only empty apologies. But no compensation.
I would never stay in this property again. Even for free.
What a waste of money."

I'm originally from a big city and it felt like a big open loft back home. it was absolutely breathtaking and the way they decorated the space was perfect.... I was sad to leave. well done!"

There is no one above you or below you so you don’t have to worry about noise.
The best Thai food in town is a few blocks around the corner (Bangkok Thai). We had a beer at No-Li brewery on their patio while waiting to pick up our Thai food.

Location was perfect for being near enough to get to the city but out of it in a nice area and surrounded by trees. My kids loved it too. Ellen and her family were fantastic. So kind and welcoming. They let my little kids play with them and see their chickens and bunnies. Will definitely be looking for an excused to come again!

Beautiful surroundings, which can be seen through the oversized picture windows within the cottage. This AirBNB provides privacy, peace, clean surroundings and comfort. Amenities for a laid back stay. Far enough away from downtown Spokane to get away, but close enough to explore. The Hosts are fantastic! Don’t hesitate to book if available!"

Stayed with kids","Ellen's place was wonderful and we can't wait to stay there again! It is such a nice space that is thoughtfully decorated with all the amenities we could need. The kitchen is well stocked and we made multiple meals there with ease during our stay. The place is very clean (I actually felt comfortable walking around in bare feet, which I can't say is true for most Airbnbs I've stayed at!). There are more than enough towels and linens, which I so appreciate! The location is so close to Spokane but so secluded with beautiful views of ponderosa pines all around. Ellen is extremely responsive, answering our messages within minutes each time. Ellen's place is our new favorite Airbnb in the Spokane area and we can't wait to visit again!"

It just was a really beautiful stay and I would definitely be staying here again anytime I wanna do a staycation. Thank you Ellen for such a beautiful home. 🤍

It was 15 mins from Spokane so we were able to spend some time in the city and spend the rest of our time being slow and in the quiet of the trees. The space was suitable for myself, my wife and my son. It had many kids accommodations. Everything in the house is modern and stylish. And the outdoor area was a major plus."

Bonus that they have chickens and turkeys wandering around the property, too.

Stayed with kids","Ellen's place is exactly the gem in the woods we were looking for to visit our EWU student. It is a beautiful 'cottage' near Ellen's family home with gorgeous woodsy views and rolling hills to stroll through.
We had a rip-roaring fire and one-half of two spooky stories were told... Ellen and her husband okayed a fire and brought kindling and wood over to boot.
Design of the space
The space feels inviting and welcoming, with no urban convenience overlooked: mini split duct heater, ambient lighting, bright seating area, big island with seating for shared meals and meal prep, big TV with Netflix once the kiddo had enough games & convo.
Both beds are dreams--comfy, elegant, and with enough lightness and extra blankets to suit your fancy.
Bathroom has a big shower.
Also, she left a dozen mini gourmet donuts. Whatttt?!"

We did have a problem with the internet when we first got there, but I messaged Jake and he walked me thru how to fix it. The only downside of this is the location which cannot be helped by Jake. There are a lot of homeless people that hang out on the street and it's very dirty on the city streets, and parking was expensive ($30 for overnight). We weren't unsafe walking around town, but you would not want to be alone."

Our only reservation about our stay was the pedestrian activity outside the building, which we somewhat anticipated based on the location description of being in the downtown area. Though once inside the apartment we felt very safe and were pleasantly surprised how quiet it was inside (minus the occasional sirens). If you don’t mind the hustle and bustle of city life, it’s a very beautiful little apartment to stay in and easy to get around. Great price as well!"

It was part of our daughter's 16th birthday celebration and she wanted to spend time enjoying downtown with some friends (and we were the chaperones). The location was perfect for walking around downtown Spokane and Riverfront Park. Access was easy and secure. We're local so we just arranged for a drop off and pick up to avoid the parking hassles. The place was clean, spacious, and comfortable and we would recommend it. Jake was very good about communicating and responding to feedback. If you're looking for a place to stay in downtown Spokane and don't mind having to make parking arrangements and can accept that you are in an urban environment (noise! traffic! grime! people from different social strata! oh my!) then you will enjoy what this stay has to offer."

My daughter travels often and suggested we try an Airbnb. Jake's listing was the perfect choice; comfortable, quiet, and within walking distance of everything we wanted see and do. This is the first Airbnb we have stayed in; Jake patiently explained the booking process which was extremely simple once we understood it. The loft apartment was exactly as pictured and included many amenities I have been told are not necessarily included with many Airbnbs. I hope this first experience doesn't spoil us for future Airbnbs!"

Definitely would not recommend parking overnight on the street. The host provided us with great recommendations for more secure parking.

Stayed a few nights","The place is beautiful with so much room! Beds were so comfortable and bathrooms large and very clean. We (three women) stayed over the weekend and everyone was pleased with the loft. Only downfall was the homeless population that filled the streets near the street level door. Of course, not the fault of the owner. Simply be aware of your surroundings when walking onto the street. We parked at The Davenport which provided piece of mind. Be careful walking the streets and use the sound machines provided by owner to drown out the noise while sleeping. We will return because the price point is awesome."

The pictures are accurate, and the location is great if you want to have a few places to eat and drink around you that are easily walkable.
We personally did not feel safe leaving the apartment late at night, so I would keep that in mind, especially if you are a solo traveler.
All in all, it was an accurate listing and we would give the place another chance."

Once inside it is very nice and safe.

Stayed a few nights","Loft is spacious, beds are comfortable, and showers have great water pressure. Jake provided great check in instructions and we had no trouble getting in. Unfortunately, sheets on the king bed were either dirty or poorly washed, and the comforter had stains. Thankfully, I was able to find extra sheets in the closet and Jake was quick to respond to my message on the issue.
We parked on the street across from the Davenport (free overnight), which was better lit than right outside the apt. Overall, the loft worked well for the two of us and I’d stay there again. However as a petite person, I didn’t feel comfortable walking to/from the unit solo at night given all the loitering out front. Aside from that, the location is great for walking to lots of restaurants and bars nearby."

Stayed a few nights","Jakes place was great, clean, great coffee, linens etc. convenient to downtown with an incredibly cool, industrial vibe! The only issue is the homeless situation is dire. Unfortunately his loft is located near the old Ridpath hotel which is now home to a significant amount of homeless. Every evening during the night there was screaming and yelling outside and drug activity across the street. We did not feel comfortable parking our car on the street or in the adjacent parking lot, so we parked at where Jake suggested, the Davenport. Weekend overnight parking is $38 a night without tip, just fyi. If it wasn’t for the homeless situation, jakes place was fantastic. Having grown up in Spokane, it was shocking to see just how bad the situation downtown has become."

4. Kitchen was clean and has all the utensils anyone will need.
5. Bathrooms were clean

The only bad was that the towels, bedsheets, etc were stinky. So end up washing them before using.

Stayed a few nights","Gorgeous apartment, beautiful kitchen with marble slab counter. Bathrooms were also beautiful. Just great design all around. Bedrooms were a great size. Pull-out couch was comfortable. Smart TV worked great. AC was flowing and made it very comfortable. Location was downtown Spokane and close to all sorts of great restaurants, bars, Spokane arena, coffee shops, etc. Super walkable plus tons of e-scooters around to rent. A few blocks from the Centennial trail which was great for running and walking. Awesome breakfast diner on the same block, and amazing tacos at Cochinito a couple blocks away. Only downside was that being downtown, there were numerous homeless about a block away, but that is to be expected downtown in most large cities, unfortunately. The host Jake was communicative, friendly, polite, responsive, and gave clear instructions. All in all an amazing place, beautiful apartment, great location, would definitely stay here again when we come to Spokane! Thank you"

Walking distance to excellent restaurants, a nice mall, the Riverfront, theaters and interesting shops. There were a few homeless folks around but not scary or problematic. Compared to other cities, Spokane is nice place to walk about with minimal trepidation. When I had questions about anything, Jake was quick to respond to my requests. Like I said, when back in Spokane, we’ll want to stay here again."

Note to those with cars: We followed Jake's recommendation of unloading in front of the Airbnb first and then moved the car to the Davenport Hotel and Tower Public Self Parking Garage on W 1st Ave and S Post St, about a 6-minute walk away, as it seemed to be the safest and most convenient option. The Davenport garage is accessible 24/7 and felt relatively secure compared to other options."

The location could not be better with restaurants, the riverfront and shops all within walking distance of the condo. Parking is everywhere and simple. This condo is perfect for enjoying Spokane. Do visit the Historic Davenport Hotel two blocks away. Its a gem. Have the lilac city cocktail in the Peacock Lounge; you will be amazed. We also loved the Satellite Diner right next door to Jake's condo. Super friendly wait staff and good food and drinks. Spokane has become a very fun city with lots to do minutes away from Jake's condo. We will definitely come back and stay at Jake's. We recommend it wholeheartedly!"

Group trip","Jake was an extremely responsive and polite host. The Airbnb was beautiful and looks exactly like the photos. The only thing was that although the main room beds were comfortable, the sofa bed was not at all. Two different people in our group tried it out and neither got much sleep the night they did. The location is walkable to just about anything in Spokane, however, just a note that there are quite a few characters and homeless that hang around right in front. That lends itself to some noise very late at night, but this isn’t incredibly out of the ordinary with downtown living. And Jake does provide lovely white noise machines. All of that aside, especially if you’re a group only using the main rooms, the home was very pretty and stocked with everything you needed. Jake was very responsive and helpful."

We used one of Jake's recommendations for parking, and parked in the Bank of America parking garage (a block west of the loft), it worked out great! The kitchen had everything we needed and we enjoyed the coffee provided. TV was easy to use! Beds were comfy! We were able to walk all around downtown Spokane easily and enjoyed multiple restaurants and bars close by (Zona Blanca was amazing!). We were there for a memorial service and did not realize the Torchlight Parade was occurring while we were there, so that was a bonus for us to enjoy, on the next street over from the loft. Would recommend if staying downtown!"

The place was clean and had a good sized kitchen. Had I stayed for more than one night, it would have been great for cooking in. Overall it is a good place to stay in. The only thing that I wasn't happy with was that I asked Jake if an earlier check in time would be possible. I got a response from Olivia that they would look into it and never heard back. I was in town for work so an early check in (hour before 4pm check in time) would have been extremely helpful for me. Despite that, I would definitely recommend this airbnb."

I had stayed at one of the other accommodations in spokane from this host and it was spotless. It was a bit noisy at night but there was a sound machine in the room which was lovely and totally drowned out the outside noise. Will stay again !

I would have selected another property if I’d known how bad the parking was up front."

Stayed about a week","This is a FANTASTIC unit! It is finished with top notch materials and appliances. With only four total units in the building this means less other people to deal with. Big, heavy doors and double glazed windows keep the notorious Spokane train noise down to a bearable level. Big, open spaces and plenty of room to feel at home. In fact, if this unit was available for long term rental, we would sign a contract today.
We did find a couple of maintenance and cleanliness issues but Jake was very quick to respond and rectify the situation. He obviously is interested in keeping these units in excellent order and showed as such.
We will certainly rent these again, if available."

Things that you don’t expect from a place with this price point. The host didn’t seem very concerned when I brought it to their attention. Just responded with “hope it doesn’t prevent from staying in the future”… That being said, the loft was worth staying at. These mistakes could be easily avoiding in the future."

The location is amazing. The concert was at the Spokane arena and it was about a 15 minute walk. An uber was about 26, so walking was the way to go. It is also within walking distance of several bars and restaurants. They also have parking extremely close, although you do have to pay so keep that in mind.
I would definitely stay again."

Minimal extra/spare amenities available for guest use however, so don’t be like me and forget makeup remover! One of the bedrooms was a little bit nosier due to facing an alley, but hosts provide white noise machine which drowns it out. Lovely showers, and lots of space for a bridal party to get hair and makeup done. Would recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","The space is stunning and a perfect location to access all of downtown Spokane. Plenty of amenities included such as extra blankets, pillows, towels, sound machines in each room, coffee & sugar, kitchenware, etc. The only bump I came across during my and my husband's stay there as newlyweds doing a short staycation, was the short supply of toilet paper (upon check-in, both bathrooms had less than half a roll each on the dispenser) and we only found 1 backup roll in one of the bathrooms. Minor inconvenience but when you're wanting to take a couple nights to recuperate from a whirlwind of days full of wedding planning, socialization and events, last thing you want to do is have to run down to a corner store. I had attempted to reach out to Roav to see if someone could drop a roll off at the door as the space hadn't been properly restocked for that specific item and had only received a response of, ""Let me look into that and we'll get back to you,"" but no one got back to us. In the grand scheme of things, it was one small inconvenience and the rest of our stay was great, but it seemed silly that we had to ask a friend to bring a roll of toilet paper to us on their way downtown."

Stayed a few nights","Very easy to work with! I needed a three-day stay at Leanne's location because it was right next door to where I was visiting. But she only had two days available, so I booked one night at another place and two with Leanne. When her other guest cancelled unexpectedly, Leanne remembered that I wanted that extra day and contacted me to let me know about the new availability before someone else could book the room. Then she adjusted my two days into three days for me. I didn't have to do anything. My stay was so much easier and less complicated because I didn't have to switch rooms mid-visit. The fact she remembered that I had initially told her weeks before that I wanted a three-day stay is testament to her attention to her guests! Thanks Leanne! Additionally, she is easy to reach and takes calls even when she is at a game with her family. :-)"

We were there during the Bloomsday Run, which was so much fun to watch from the patio, even in the rain, and wave to Leanne as she ran by. The bed was so comfortable, the area quiet, so Cheyenne and I got a good night's sleep each night. The place was so clean, nicely decorated, and exactly as advertised. The only off-putting thing was the exterior of the building and the yard, there is a definite need for maintenance and cleanup. Cheyenne and I would DEFINITELY stay here again when visiting family in Spokane. Thank you Leanne for allowing my cat to stay with me."

Stayed with a pet","We have stayed at many Airbnb places and appreciated the comfortable bed. The space inside was clean and as described.
The description of “other people living in the home” didn’t indicate to us that there were a wide array of tenants who shared a home partitioned off into apartments. We assumed that the Airbnb host lived in the home attached to the rental (which is typical). We especially do not like staying in a place where someone is living on a floor above us. We heard normal conversations like they were in our apartment and our neighbors upstairs started walking around and making noise at 4:30 in the morning. Not the ideal “restful vacation”.There was also a pot smell coming from another unit most of the stay.
The neighborhood was quiet and the trail across the street was a nice place to walk.
One thing that would be a great addition is some coffee! One k-cup per night per person would be nice. This is the only Airbnb we have stayed in that didn’t provide any offering ofcoffee."

The only downside was that a neighbor was smoking marijuana and the smell made it into the living room. Leanne was super apologetic and tried to make the situation right. It wasn't a huge deal since we were only in the unit in the evening, but if you are super sensitive to that particular smell it could potentially be an issue. I know the host is trying to keep this from happening in the future, and it didn't seem like a super common occurrence for other people staying in the unit. Overall, I would recommend this airbnb!"

The only negative was the heaters aren't marked and it was hard to tell if it was being turned up or down and would get super hot or cold until we figured it out. Also some different odors would come through the ventilation from neighbors in small house. overall, would recommend. Great little place."

There are heaters in all rooms, bright lively space, coffee for the morning and it’s in a cute area. I spotted a deer walking around when parking, it was so cool. The check-in was super easy and Leanne was very responsive, helpful and sweet. The desk/work area was great and came in handy during a late meeting after work. Parking was easy also (street parking). I would definitely stay here again, no questions asked. Perfect, cute and cozy."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay. We loved that the kitchen included various items that we usually need to purchase at other units we’ve stayed at like oil, salt & pepper, etc. Also, was great there was shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and hand soap. Having Roku TV was awesome and the wifi worked well. The unit was spotless and it was nice to have cleaning supplies, etc available so we could clean up after ourselves. The area was very nice and we felt safe. The only thing that we didn’t enjoy was the sofa that was very uncomfortable. We also had one communication issue when there was a problem with the water and we understand things happen but in the future it would be great if guests could get a heads up if possible so they could prepare. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much."

The only thing I didn't see was pepper but there is a really good seasoning that I used instead of pepper. The AC unit in the bedroom and the tower fan in the living room kept the place at a nice temperature. The apartment is in a beautiful old house that has been turned into apartments even so we couldn't really hear anything inside from the other apartments just sometimes very faint foot steps above but they were not loud at all. We will definitely be back!!

Stayed one night","We stayed at Leanne's place twice (1 night/each time) on our way through Spokane on a vacation trip to Montana, so this is a combined review for both stays.
Pros:
*Good location. Easy access to Centennial Trail (nice view/walking path)
*Unit was immaculate.
*Nice choice of bath/soap products.
*Appreciated an early check-in (2nd stay) when we got there faster than expected!
Cons (or FYI info for other travelers):
*Listing says ""River view"", but there isn't one from this unit (it's located on back side of house).
*The unit doesn't have a dishwasher or garbage disposal. That might get old over longer stays.
*The somewhat broken concrete walkway to the house from the street + steep steps to unit aren't friendly for someone w/ mobility issues.
*After 1st stay, received an accusatory message abt having an unauthorized cat in unit, which was untrue. We had a service dog, which had been previously communicated. It got sorted out, but that wasn't a cool way to broach the subject."

The house didn’t have any A/C and it was mentioned in the description but I didn’t care for it. She went out of her way to get an A/C installed so it can be fresh throughout my stay!
The house was very clean, simple and beautiful! Room was very comfortable, the surroundings were quiet and peaceful. Parking wasn’t an issue and everything was close by.

Stayed about a week","I was completely satisfied with my stay. Jake provided thorough instructions for my stay. The check-in process was super easy, and my first impression of the place was, ""Wow!""
The entire apartment was immaculate and spacious. I really appreciated having pots and pans and dishes to cook with. My room had a king-size bed that I'm pretty sure was made out of clouts. The comfort of this bed was ten out of ten. The rooms were pretty soundproof other than when someone would walk down the hall by my door, which wasn't often and didn't bother me at all. The shower was hot and had good pressure. T v's had access to netflix and hulu and disney plus, which we loved.
Jake was very responsive to any questions that I had and was very quick to message back. Other than to answer my questions, he left me to be and gave me the privacy that I was worried wouldn't come with an airbnb.
I would absolutely rent from this host again."

Stayed with kids","Our short stay over 4th of July was wonderful. We took advantage of the location being right next to the Original Pancake House and could pop down for a quick breakfast before heading out for the day. Had it just been the adults we could have walked easily into downtown and to Riverfront park, but chose to drive the quick 5 minute drive over to the playground at Riverfront park to enjoy some kid time. We were also right around from the freeway and could pop into Spokane valley within 15 minutes. The place was clean, cool, and comfortable. Would certainly consider staying again when we come back into Spokane."

Group trip","Jake is a very responsive host and the place was large, comfortable, fairly well- appointed and clean.
Caution - where the listing says, ""sleeps 5,"" with the 5th on a sofa - this is literally a couch, NOT a sleeper sofa! Fortunately, our 5th was a teenager, but had she been an adult, this would not have worked. Location is +/-, since it's right near Riverfront Park & downtown, but has lots of nighttime racket - from late-night revelers or homeless folks conducting screaming fights in the street, to 430am garbage collection, it is noisy noisy noisy at night. And the windows seem to not provide any insulation against the din - it all sounds like the yellers are in the room with you. We found the HVAC to be problematic - rooms don't operate independently of one another, so if one sleeper wants it cool and another wants it warm, you're out of luck.
Finally, hosts needs to invest in a luggage cart, especially for units at the back, and luggage racks so suitcases are not on the floor."

Stayed a few nights","Super convenient to the Convention Center. The unit looks just as fantastic in person as it does in the photos. Roomy and comfortable. It was easy to pull up into the loading zone in front of the building when we arrived and departed, for ease of luggage transport. If you are sensitive to synthetic fragrance, you might want to bring your own bath linens. Jake kindly sent over two extra washcloths when four of us arrived for a four-night stay and there were only about six (but we could have used 16 in all). The master suite closet was roomy and had plenty of hangers, but it'd be nice to have a dresser or at least a table to set our bags on. The outdoor lights shone so brightly into the master bedroom (even with blinds closed) that I kept thinking all night that it was dawn, exacerbated by the lack of a clock. I really appreciated that there was not a long list of chores to do before we left. He asked that we merely start the dishwasher and lock the door."

Stayed one night","I do not live far from Spokane, but stayed here for my birthday weekend. The apartment was beautiful and so well decorated. We had some issues with the TV, but Jake responded so quickly regarding any questions I had. He tried his best to come up with a resolution, which was so great. My only complaint is the parking. Jake does let you know about parking prior to booking, which is why I still have 5 stars, but I had to pay $27 for parking at the parking garage down the street and walk back in downtown Spokane which was not my favorite. Nothing he can do about that, I just didn’t like having to walk to the parking garage and having to pay $27 for parking when staying here.
Will recommend Jake’s places time and time again, but be sure to read the details before booking. He has some amazing places with on site parking. This place is just not one of them.
Otherwise, fantastic stay. Had an amazing time and will use Jake’s places in the future!!"

The beds are SUPER comfortable. I would say this is more of a place for adults because of the location. The ground coffee and tea was an awesome extra.
The biggest issue is the parking, you have to park a block away and pay about $30/night and this does make it hard with children at night because of some of the sketchy people/homeless around. I would also suggest ear plugs as the road noise/people going by can be pretty loud."
