Stayed a few nights","Adam's place was very cozy and nice. We loved staying there. The walls are a little thin so make sure your TV isn't too loud. The neighbors also kept hitting the shared wall so that was a little annoying but I don't think it was anything Adam could have helped. Also there is no washer and dryer so be prepared for that. All in all, it was super clean and nice. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed over a week","We needed a place to stay medium term and Adam’s little place was perfect.
The kitchen is fully equipped with fridge/freezer, microwave, oven, sink and counter tops. The bathroom has a shower with multiple settings and good pressure, a toilet and a sink. It also has fast wifi, a Roku and a comfortable bed.
Autumn at Adam’s place was gorgeous, the two big trees in front of the place had beautiful autumnal colouration through October and November.
Adam was very accommodating while checking in, allowing us to check in early and move in for the stay. Throughout our stay he checked on us and washed the linens weekly on our terms, while being respectful our privacy.
The neighbours were very friendly and quiet.
In terms of walkability there is a pals, food city and gym across the road. Downtown is a 20 minute walk and the mall is a 30 minute walk.
We really enjoyed our stay and we highly recommend it to others.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I came down for a wedding, and Adam's place was perfect for what we needed. It is close to downtown and a grocery store, and within 10 minutes, you have shopping and restaurants. We definitely recommend the Hillbilly Cabin. We ate there twice it was so good. We loved the cozy feel to the space. The furniture was nice and comfy. Having a stove and full refrigerator was nice as well. The house is on a busy road mainly during the day but you don't notice the noise while inside. Adam is very responsive and friendly. He answered any questions we had. We did have a minor issue, but Adam took care of it right away, and it did not affect our stay one bit. I would recommend staying here and would stay here again. Thank you for sharing your beautiful and welcoming space."

You can’t beat the price with all the amenities. So glad we stayed here instead of an average hotel room that would have cost more for less amenities.

Stayed a few nights",Adam's Place was perfect for our stay. It was very clean and we loved the decor. It looks just like the pictures. The bed mattress was so comfortable and so was the bedding & pillows. It was set up with all the necessities we needed for our stay. The host was very nice and responded quickly when I reached out to him. We appreciated the suggestions for restaurants in the area that are in the guidebook. We would highly recommend Hillbilly's Cabin restaurant. The food was really good. The books on the coffee table with suggestions for things to do were a nice touch. We really think the sound machine was a great idea and used it every night. We want one for our home now. The USB outlets on the nightstands were a great touch. The studio has great lighting and when the curtains are closed they block the outside light really well. The parking spaces are right in front of the house and you can back up close to the door for easy loading & unloading of a vehicle. We would definitely stay again.

Stayed one night","This was a great stop for an overnight stay! Everything was clean and comfortable, and the host was responsive. My only note is that there were quite a few bugs that I had to deal with (no bed bugs though!). While I was comfortable with managing them being from the South, and I think it'd just a product of being in a warm climate, it may not be the best location for you if you typically don't do well with bugs like spiders. Otherwise, I was very happy with the accessibility of the space, especially the shower seat. (For wheelchair users I'd note that there are ledges, but the area is pretty spacious enough to wheel around, and the bed is lower to the ground.) Thank you!"

Stayed one night","We had a unplanned trip to Morristown as my Mother In Law had just passed.
Adam was very responsive to my messages and was extremely helpful. We had to make adjustments to our reservation and he went with the flow.
I liked how the place was located in a quiet part of town. The next door residents were friendly as well. Looks like a Police Officer lived up the road so that added to the sense of security. There is a nice grocery store within 2-3 blocks as well.
This place was sooo nice! Nice touches, good lighting, bed was comfortable and so clean!
I’d would stay again if I’m in the area.
Thank you"

Stayed with kids","This is a nice studio if you coming into just need a comfortable nice quick stay! Personally it was a bite noisey due to the neighbors that are connected to the apartment and games from the baseball field which were actually nice at times but keep alot of traffic. Pros the studio was spacious, comfortable and really really clean!! Also I want to stay how great Adam was as a host, he was very responsive and accommodating. I would book again just would probably book if I was alone amd not working from wherever I am. Overall it's a 7.5/10 only bc of the location"

It is exactly as described in the listing and as pictures show. It is probably the best studio I’ve ever stayed in, and I’ve been to many as a travel nurse. It was very spacious, clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Bed was super comfortable and the sound machine was the extra bonus points. So many things that are very detail oriented I could go on and on. Host is quick to respond to messages. Absolutely beautiful."

Both the bathroom and kitchen are spotless and have everything you might need. The location is quiet, I'm a light sleeper and typically don't sleep well when I travel. I got a good night's sleep both nights during my stay thanks to the very comfy bed and the provided fan. The value of this place is amazing, it really punches above its price point."

Stayed one night","This was perfect for a quick night's rest. Adam was flexible with check-in which was convenient since we were traveling and stopping in the middle of the night. It was easy to find at 4am. The layout is simple yet it provides a full kitchen, comfortable couch and chair, clean bathroom, and kitchen table. The bed wasn't comfortable to me but I had no issues with moving to the couch. It is close to a road but a noise machine was provided to help block out the unwanted noise. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again during our travels from PA to Memphis. Adam was great communicating with me throughout the process."

Stayed a few nights","This is a really cozy and efficient place! Close to grocery stores, food and other shopping. Inside its all one room but its a huge space. Nice big comfy couch, flat screen Roku TV, nice sized kitchen. I loved the little details like having a luggage rack! This place is basically brand new, spotless and really well done. No issues with noise, had its own temperature control as well. Bed was comfy as were the pillows. Only downside was, its not sitting on a box spring so the bed is lower to the ground. My suggestions for future guests would be to leave the porch light on, as it was difficult to see the keypad at night. The lights inside were VERY bright. I couldn't keep them on as it made the place bright white. I opted to just leave 1 on it, so perhaps softer lighting. There are now darkening shades so this gets plenty of sunlight. I will keep this place in mind!!"

While I would normally pick a more secluded location, Kevin's home was clean, comfortable and exactly where we needed to be for this trip. I felt very comfortable walking my 2 dogs around the neighborhood by myself. Kevin was very friendly and quick to respond. I didn't need an EV charger, but for a lot of folks, that would be a huge plus. If you are looking for in-town location, this is a great little home for your stay."

Stayed with a pet","Upon arrival we found that the property has homes, a bank and counseling building around it. The bank does have a 24 hour ATM rather close to the house.
During our first few hours we discovered several things about this property. The couch was inviting and the TV in the living room was enjoyable. However, there are sounds of trains rumbling on tracks, the blowing of the train horns, street traffic, as well as the usage of the ATM that can all be heard in the home at all hours of the day and night. The water heater is in one of the bedrooms. It is in the closet with only a utility door. It also can be heard at all hours filling and turning itself on and off to keep the water hot.
The property does not offer recycling. But we found that it was still possible to recycle in town. The Ingles on West Andrew Johnson Highway will recycle both paper & plastic."

Stayed over a week","This home is every bit as great as the pics. Very cozy and fully equipped. I spent a month here for work and Morristown has everything. Close to the the touristy areas like Gatlinburg and smoky mountain national park (30 ish min drive) and even closer to nice outdoor activity like panther creek state park (great for getting your dog out!). The home was sparking clean, the fully equipped kitchen was extra handy for extended stays. 10/10 would recommend."

We were initially a little concerned when booking about the location next to a bank parking lot, but that ended up to be no concern at all. The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and actually quite lovely."

Stayed a few nights","Had a great time at the house! Loved the quiet peaceful surroundings and the view! I gave the “price you paid for” stars low because I was unaware of the unusable dock due to the lake being so low. The dock was completely beached. Was expecting to be able to get in/out from the dock with a raft/canoe. For future renters, if there was a “due to the time of year, the dock won’t be available to be used” caption that would’ve been helpful. Loved the space, it was open and very neat. Another suggestion, John does list to bring things for the firepit, which we did so thank you, but did not mention to bring disposables such as coffee filters, paper towels, and bottled/filtered water (if you prefer it). Maybe there could be a Brita water pitcher available? Or add it to the list of stuff not on property. Did not base my ratings on that missing stuff, these are merely suggestions. We had an awesome time! We went hiking on a trail less than 5 miles from the house and it was all beautiful!"

Close proximity to major routes gets you to quaint downtown Morristown in 20 minutes and Knoxville or Pigeon Forge in around an hour. Plenty of local history within a half hour. We swam nightly off the dock and enjoyed beautiful sunsets. Bring crocs or water shoes as the ground is rocky and the lake level rises spring and summer and goes down in fall and winter. AC in the bungalow is super effective and quickly cools the place down in the hottest part of the day. John and Carrie are great hosts and got back to us quickly when we had questions. We loved our stay so much and would most definitely rent from them again."

Stayed with kids","We love the location and accommodations of John's bungalow. It sits far back from the road with a generous amount of grassy lawn on both the front and back sides of the home. Our kids loved the freedom it allowed to run around where the house sits a very safe distance from the waterfront. The property slopes gently as you walk down to the lake. The TVA lowers the water in the winter months providing plenty of rocky beach area for kids to play and explore as well.
We enjoyed lots of pink and purple sunsets over the lake from the comfort of the couch inside the picture window and often from the rocking chairs on the covered porch even in the winter.
The covered porch, abundance of blankets on hand, crock pot, fire pit and open concept between the kitchen and living room were some of our favorite features.
John is an accommodating and super responsive host. We'd be glad to book his place again.
15 minutes to the mall, movie theater, Ross, Walmart SuperCenter, etc.
9 minutes to Holt's IGA or 12 minutes to the Walmart Neighborhood Market for groceries
10 minutes to Cherokee Park (playground and splash pad)
The G H Coffman Country store (inexpensive, homemade breakfast and lunch Thurs-Sat and old-fashioned candy) down the road and the Red Barn Produce (tons of jams and spreads and some Amish made products) in Rutledge about 10 minutes away are some of our favorite local small businesses."

The weather was rainy so I didnt take advantage of the fire pit or grill. The road it's on is easy to pass if you're driving in the dark. But not tough to find. The kitchen was stocked with basic applicances, cookware, dinnerware, serveware that's needed. No wine glasses, but that's no biggie. I will definitley be making plans to come back!"

The outside temperature this morning was 46 and inside was 55. The three of us are retired military, in our 60's and 70's, and have an issue with cold temperatures. As nice as the cabin was, we will not return due to the host controlling the thermostat."

4 hours into our 7 hour drive from home, both Airbnb and John/Carrie reached out to me about the place needing to be cancelled.
John/Carrie never spoke to their previous stayers to check to make sure what their dates were. They apparently thought they were booked another night.
Another thing, we’re in the middle of a pandemic and you book people HOURS before each other when COVID 19 needs two weeks to die in any certain area.
My family and I were looking for safe, social distanced vacation and unfortunately that’s not what we got."

You wanna book this. If you’re needing a get away headspace trip? Do this. This is a tucked away tiny home that has a beautiful lake view, delightful charm, and every amenity you would ever need.
My husband and I came through and spent a week here, we wanted to be close that we could drive to the pretty mountains and Gatlinburg.
If you don’t mind the hour and twenty minute drive then this is it. It’s affordable 1/2 the price of any other smoky mountain AirBnb and it comes with sweet like views? Amazing
We also had everything we needed. There wasn’t that usual AirBnb moment when we had to run to a Walmart because there weren’t any plates or a toaster. We saved money and cooked a lot there.
This is an amazing place, truly I do recommend it."

The porches are wonderful to just sit and listen to the woods. Yesterday, I was sitting on the front porch eating my dinner and looked out the screen to see a deer standing in the yard enjoying a meal itself. I don't think you can get that anywhere else.
The top floor has the bedrooms, a quiet formal living room, and a great kitchen to cook in. In the downstairs is the family room with a big TV, pool table, and stand-up arcade game. I learned I still suck at Pac-Man. The place is huge!
if you want a quiet woodland house that is ten minutes away from the city, this is it! Also, Becky is very responsive and helpful. I strongly recommend this place, book it!"

Stayed a few nights","So, I would describe it as a porch with a building attached. There is this amazing porch on the front and one on the back from the master bedroom to the kitchen. They're amazingly peaceful. I spent a week there for work, and to be able to leave work and sir on the porches listening to the Carolina wrens, blue Jay, and the owls so absolutely wonderful. I come to morristown tennessee every other week, and this is my favorite place that I have stayed at, and if I can not pull it off, the only place I will stay at from this point on."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay at Becky's. All of the little extras Becky left were so nice..... granola bars, popcorn, oatmeal, etc. Also, the bathrooms had shampoo, soaps, etc if you forgot your own. The place was just as the pictures indicated. It is above a garage and I wondered how that would feel, but once you get inside, it is a really well constructed and cozy place. We spent alot of time on the screen porch, loved it. The setting is very peaceful. Just something to note, there is no TV in the living room area, (which does allow time to just visit without all the noise.), but if you have mobility issues or want to watch sports or movies as a group, you must watch TV in the master bedroom or down in the game room. We had a few issues with the hotspot connecting, but Becky was very responsive and worked with us to get it resolved. She was quick to respond. We would definitely stay again."

We have property nearby in. New Tazewell so this cabin was perfect for us. Thank you for a pleasant and easy check in process and great communication. Hope to stay again soon."

It’s like the Goldilocks of AirBnB’s – everything is “just right”. It’s close to everything, but far from noise.

It has all the amenities you could possibly want, yet it’s totally uncluttered, with enough space for you to easily spread out and enjoy yourself.

It's in an area close to all the new restaurants and is close enough to the interstate to not be an inconvenience. I would recommend Kevin's place to anyone that asked and have no reservations about staying here again in the future."

Stayed one night","Great place with lots of room. Home is exactly as described in the listing. Kevin is always great to deal with, often answering questions and giving information before you even think to ask. Providing guests with Netflix is a simple but very appreciated little extra. Sometimes it is easier to just put Netflix on than trying to navigate a ""new"" channel line up of live TV. Having a Netflix account provided is nice so guests don't have to sign into their own and worry about remembering to sign out before they check out. This isn't a problem or a complaint, but a FYI for future renters, the tread (depth) on the steps going downstairs felt a little shorter than what I'm used to. The elderly may need to take extra caution if going downstairs."

It was a great place that was very clean, roomy and very reasonably priced compared to checking in a hotel and renting 5 rooms. Being in the middle of Morristown it made it very close to travel to friends and family.

Stayed a few nights","The easiest check in! Although the neighbors are close by, when you step inside you will forget all about them. The pictures online are great, but in person it’s perfect! It feels like you’ve stepped into your very own vacation home. The place is very neatly kept. You’ll have the basic amenities and a couple of extras; coffee, snack basket, cold bottles of water.
The area is very peaceful and for the most part private. I recommend waking up early and drinking coffee on the deck with the sunrise.
The hosts themselves are more than accommodating, they make you feel at home. They came with great recommendations on food places. The locally owned restaurants are really good, but be prepared to drive for your typical chain food places. As for the hosts, they even offered to take us out on their boat, so we did! Early morning guided fishing trip on the Cherokee Lake? Yes please! The boat ride itself is worth it, alone.
Do yourselves a favor, BOOK NOW!
Thank you for a fantastic stay!"

Group trip","Kevin’s house provided great accommodation for our gathering of retired siblings. The house is an older home with a nice cosmetic rehab, clean, comfortable with large common areas for gathering and relaxing. Located in a quiet, clean, well-cared for neighborhood with easy access to Morristown and the surrounding area. The house was well stocked and ready for use when we arrived. Communication before, during and after our stay was exceptional, Kevin clearly has the hosting routine nailed down. Everyone in our party was very complimentary of all aspects of this rental and wouldn’t hesitate to book again should the opportunity ever arise."

Group trip","My husband and brother sing in a gospel quartet and were invited to sing in a church in the area. We wanted to find a spot that was affordable enough and allowed all of us to stay together in one place that would allow the opportunity to do any last minute practice if needed. This was perfect! It allowed everyone their own space but also the ability to hang together. Also we weren’t certain how many from each of our families might tag along so it allowed enough available space to accommodate whoever decided to come. I can’t say enough about Kevin’s responsiveness. We wanted to be able to check in a little earlier if possible and he was able and willing to make that happen. We didn’t have any issues while there but if we did I’m sure he would’ve taken care of them as quickly as possible. While it may have been a little more expensive than staying in cheap hotel the value of being together in a clean and inviting environment was well worth it. Big family or multi, Highly Recommend!"

Group trip","Kevin’s place is absolutely gorgeous and has a tremendous amount of space for a large family. It’s very comfortable and extremely clean. The amenities are high end. I thought I was staying at a five star resort. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The neighbors are welcoming and helpful. The home is beautifully decorated and has an amazing media room for all to enjoy. Kevin is an amazing host that responds to you promptly and is extremely helpful. If I had to rate Kevin’s interaction with us, I would say he goes beyond “Superhost”. I would say he is a rare extraordinary Superhost. The home is not far from many beautiful cities such as Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, Knoxville, Jefferson City, and Rogersville. I’m sure there are many other beautiful cities to explore, but we just didn’t have the time. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend you stay at Kevin’s if your visiting Tennessee."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time renting Kevin's home. This time, I rented it for my best friend and her 4 young adult kids. They loved it and had lots of room to spread out. The biggest plus,it's one mile away from my new home!! We are still unpacking so we were not as ready as we had hoped to be to host our company/family.
The house is clean, nicely appointed, easy to feel right at home and conveniently located near grocery stores, restaurants, etc.
I would definitely recommend this home!! I am sure it won't be our last time either!!!
Thank you, Kevin!!!"

It was so nice to have a place that felt like home to recharge each night after long days of activities in the area. We didn’t have small children but I noticed the extra care taken to cater to groups and families at all stages of life including a fenced yard, baby gates, etc. I would definitely stay here again when we’re back in the area."

The house has its own online manual which was super helpful since we were traveling with a group of people who would be in and out at various times. It’s located on the west end of Morristown, tucked away in the hills, just perfect for what we needed! Quick access to I-40 or Andrew Johnson HW. It had plenty of space, blankets, towels and the beds were very comfortable. Already has shampoo, conditioner and body wash in every bathroom along with a straightener, hair dryer and curling iron! Made packing much easier! Can’t thank Kevin enough for opening up his home!!"

All in all, if the camera wasn't there I would stay here again."

Kevin is the most organized AirBnB host we have ever rented from. Communication was excellent every step of the way, and he is very responsive for any questions or concerns. Even after we checked out, I realized I left an item behind, and he graciously offered to mail it to, easy breezy.
I highly recommended Kevin and his home in Morristown."

Stayed with a pet",I was nervous about the size of the road you arrive to the air bnb on and they offered a full refund due to the inconvenience. I decided to stay because it was so beautiful and relaxing and they made the stay feel very peaceful. The hosts put a lot of effort into making me comfortable even though the air bnb was slightly hard to find on night one. Everything is well signed and the descriptions for parking were spot on. Would stay again!

unfortunately, there is another unit directly above this one and you will hear nearly every step from you upstairs neighbor.

still had a good time, the lake was great. fair price point."

There are a fair amount of steps, yard, and slopped driveways to navigate to this unit from the designated parking space which is the furthest away from the access point (essentially off property)."

Stayed with a pet","The scenery was absolutely beautiful and the cabin was modern and even nicer than the pictures. I think this place is a pretty good choice for a little retreat or a stop on a road trip. My only complaints are the lock to the door is a bit temperamental and does not seem the most secure. I also think blinds on the sliders would go a long way, as you have no privacy when other guests use the fire pit outside. Other than these pretty minor mishaps, I really enjoyed my time here."

The lake is BEAUTIFUL and I spent most of the time outside on the water.
I didn't like that the listing says it sleeps up to four but to get to the bathroom you have to go through the two-person bedroom. The space and updates are great but it was missing small things like oven mitts for the toaster and it didn't have enough flatware for four people. The lake is beautiful and the shower felt like a spa!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a super nice little place in a great location and well worth the cost. There are some things to be aware of though as well.
Pros - great/responsive hosts. I was able to extend our stay for a day and a couple minor things the prop mgr is nearby to help with quickly. It's clean, in a gorgeous location and what seemed like a nice and safe area. It's not too far to town if anything is needed.
Cons - unit is the lower level of a building, there's another unit right above you, so depending on who's staying there it could be noisy. We met the people staying above us - they were great, but that may not always be the case. The kitchen is small - the fridge/coffee/toaster oven all kind of share space, so you need to move the fridge in and out so the doors clear each other. Parking is a little awkward, and plan to haul your stuff a fair distance down a hill and stairs. Be aware of neighbor dogs - they'll come after vehicles and lay in the road.
Overall - great value, we'd stay again."

Bonus points for being able to bring my pup and for how responsive they were to my questions!

Also, not a lot of clutter on tables or furniture or in the bathroom, so we could spread out. Made it feel much more like home!

Stayed one night","The listing does not state that this is a lower level of a cabin where there will be other guests/residents above you. That was communicated via the hosts once I already booked and they sent check-in instructions. Had I known that, I would not have picked this place as I was seeking a private getaway. While it was mostly peaceful, I woke up to footsteps above us before my alarm went off, and I heard a man yell the evening before. I didn’t like the particular parking and requirement to essentially navigate the grounds a certain way because of the multiple, separate residences on the property.
Aside from that, everything was great. The place was as cute and clean as pictured. I asked a couple of questions and the hosts were super responsive and helpful. I also liked that the listing was available for a one-night stay versus a two-night minimum like a lot of places require."

Stayed with a pet","I thought the space was very beautiful and comfortable!! The photos are exactly what you get when you show up! The instructions were clear for us to understand from where to park and how to navigate the cabin spaces. There are other rentals on the same property, but still very private! In this space, it is under another cabin so you can hear the people walking above you, but it wasn’t much of a disturbance. The view is very pretty from the living room, but my only recommendation would be to have a curtain or something for guests to have more privacy. The sliding door was completely open with no way to cover, so anyone who may be passing can see into the living room/kitchen especially during the night when you can’t see outside but people can see inside lol. The bedroom is completely private which is good. The road leading up is veeeery narrow. You would have to let other cars pass or other cars let you pass, if there is even room for that. Overall great though!"

There are signs all over telling you that you cannot turn around in the neighbors driveway, which makes it very difficult to get in and out of. If you plan on bringing a boat here, don’t! You won’t be able to park it, and it would be a literal nightmare to turn around. And backing all the way out the one lane road to the main road would also be a nightmare."

Stayed one night","It was just what I needed! I stayed one night, with plans to go to Dollywood the next day. The place looked just like the photos. I was traveling alone, and I felt safe in the home, the neighborhood, and at the nearby disc golf park I went to. My host was incredibly responsive, but she also gave me my personal space. It was everything I wanted."

She was very flexible about our late check in, the room was clean and we had everything we need. Karla answered quick and always made sure that we feel safe and comfortable. We definitely recommend her as a host. Thank you!"

The space is very cute and cozy. It is a basement apartment so you can hear a normal amount of footsteps but nothing too loud that prevented us from being able to sleep or feel comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again!

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I enjoyed Sarah’s home very much. The layout was great. The kitchen and dining area is quite large, with everything you need. The living room is great for relaxing. The bedrooms and bathrooms were excellent. The beds were very comfortable.
Everything was very clean and taken care of. It was as described or better. It is a perfect location, near enough for day trips to Dollywood/Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge, the tri city/NE area, and the Cumberland Plateau.
Sarah and Barbara’s communication was excellent.
The neighborhood was slightly louder than we expected, (mowing at 6:20 am, dogs barking, etc.) but that is to be expected as you are walking distance to much of the city, and a 2-5 minute drive to the majority of the shops and downtown area of Morristown.
We were very happy with our stay and would recommend Sarah’s home to everyone."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay at Dillon's space downtown. It was beautifully furnished and had plenty of amenities like popcorn machine, darts, fireplace, wine fridge, jacuzzi tub, steam shower, the list goes on! It was right in the middle of the downtown area and even with a transit van, we always had a spot to park. Entry and exit were a breeze with the lockbox. The only areas that could have been improved were timeliness of responses, and there happened to be some long hairs on the towels. No evidence that they weren't cleaned, this could have just been something that was floating around. We just grabbed another one from the many towels available. Foot traffic in front of the windows was heavy, so we opened and closed the blinds as necessary to feel comfortable. As Dillon states in his house instructions, the blinds are delicate. Unfortunately they fell during our stay (sorry!). Otherwise the place was spotless, perfectly located, and I would definitely not hesitate to stay again."

Stayed one night","Such a cool home! You walk right in off the Main St. sidewalk and have that cool downtown vibe as you step in the door. The inside is very cool, very masculine but sexy at the same time. Smelled good, felt good, looked good throughout. Very spacious rooms, large comfy bed in the master, soft towels and toilet paper in the bathrooms, and a kitchen with everything you need.
What else do you need?"

It completely checked every box for me and our needs. Freezer space was hard to fit the frozen pizzas in, but we only had to keep them in there around an hour or so. Overall, highly recommend!"

We live in Airbnbs full time (going on 2 years). This is the best one we have ever stayed in. Comfortable, cute, very well appointed, and perfect location for easy walking to all of downtown Morristown. Personal touches such as a working, old-fashioned, popcorn cart, a dart board, a record player (with records you’d want to listen to), and a kitchen that would make Gordon Ramsay smile.
It is at the top of our places to return."

It was so quiet and peaceful. We fished in the lake, hung out by the fire pit, and generally enjoyed the seclusion this property provided. Cheryl was very responsive to my numerous questions and easy to get in touch with. My dog joined us and he had a great time trying to chase all the rabbits and birds.
The home is fully stocked with everything you would need! Books, puzzles, tailgate chairs, basic seasonings, towels, soap, shampoo, etc. The only thing we needed and brought were groceries!
Our entire group enjoyed themselves and it will be a vacation to remember!"

Stayed a few nights","This cabin was just as described. However, the pictures don't really do it justice. The hill is steep, however fairly easy to manage, and we do appreciate the heads up! The cabin temp was perfect, and each room had an additional fan if needed. The cabin was clean. The kitchen was fully equipped, all we needed was our own food. The game room was perfect for the two 15 year old boys we had with us.
The beach is very private. I was a little concerned about having the neighbors so close, however, we seldom saw them, and we pretty much had the lake to ourselves. Boat traffic was very minimal. Visiting around was pretty easy as well. Traveling around was easy as well, your location wasn't too far away from the more popular areas. All in all, a great vacation spot and highly recommend this cabin and will definitely consider coming back!"
