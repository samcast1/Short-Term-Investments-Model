Stayed with kids",Alan’s place is pretty isolated and rustic. The spiral staircase is a little difficult to navigate with large and heavy luggage buy we did manage. To Alan’s credit he did offer to help via a previous email but he was busy mowing hay when we got there. There is a stray golden cat that was a tripping hazard around the spiral staircase and did jump in our car on our toddlers lap. When my wife lifted up the cat gently to remove her it did scratch her so be careful around it as Alan says it is a stray. The place was very rustic with plenty of wood to decorate the walls and ceiling. Their was a beautiful new handmade dining room table and new stove and washer and dryer which all worked wonderfully. The loft is over a large garage and has a deck that is about 20 ft in the air. We felt some of the wood rails had large enough openings for our toddler to fall through so something to consider for staying. One morning we were awoken at 6:50 EST by barking dogs and there was occasional garage noise

The place was so peaceful right on their farm with a pond to swim and fish with a slide for adults and kids to enjoy!
We booked for one night and loved it so much we had to book for another.
The home was so beatiful and stunning as well.
We will definitely be back!"

The hosts are excellent, very responsive and easy to get ahold of. My husband and I and our two dogs stayed for 6 weeks in the loft. The loft is beautifully done with lots of storage. The kitchen and bath are fully stocked with all the essentials you may need. The king bed is very comfy. I would highly recommend this rental."

Listening to the sheep, looking at the ducks and water, smelling the wood from the loft. It’s just beautiful and I will book a stay at a later date when it’s warm and can explore the outdoors. Alan was very accommodating to my last minute needs as I am a travel nurse which I appreciated so much."

Stayed one night",We loved our stay with Alan and Amy. It was fun seeing all the inventive work they put into building The Loft. For a tall winding stairs it was very user friendly and easy to climb. Also the hosts offered to help with luggage several times. The porch/deck was great and would be a great place to hang out in warm weather. The Loft was very comfortable and livable and very well thought out with lots of ingenious storage spaces. I enjoyed the deep bath tub which was easy to get into and out of. My daughter LOVED the cats that visited us on the porch and playing with the kittens in the morning. My husbands favorite was the plate of divinity Amy left on the table for us. The farm setting and all the animals were relaxing and we felt very safe leaving our car partially packed for the night. We would definitely recommend their bnb to others & will return if in the area again.

Both places are always clean and the property itself is gorgeous. Alan and the family are great welcoming people, always happy to go out of their way to make you feel right at home.
Can't recommend their place enough. It's been my favorite out of the 40+ I've stayed at.
Gaslight is near with good food and Schnitzelbank is the best German restaurant I've found in the US."

The ponds were perfect for fishing during the day and dining table was perfect for games at night. Even enjoyed a few movies on the SmartTV...which included ""A League of Their Own."" If anyone is familiar with that movie, you have to take a tour of League Stadium downtown Huntingburg. Its where they filmed the home games for that movie. The tour was fantastic."

Stayed a few nights","Alan and his folks have a great place to stay. The space was very clean and the homemade sweets on arrival were great. We brought our three dogs (two of which are bird dogs) and took them on walks around the farm which was probably the greatest part of the whole place. The three weenie dogs did bark at our dogs a little bit but were easily shooed away with the help of my wife, if you bring your dogs just make sure you bring leashes and you’ll be fine. Overall, this was a great place to stay, super clean, relaxing, and away from city life. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Very beautiful inside the loft. It was cute seeing all the farm animals and lots of scenery. My only two slight grievances were the door to the bedroom that led out to the garage. I wasn’t too comfortable with the idea of a door that led to outside in the place where I slept. Unfortunately, it led to some difficulties sleeping for the first two nights. My other comment would be, when the dogs were outside, it was a bit difficult to go up and down the driveway. They would get close to the car and make us worried they would get in front of it. As mentioned in other reviews, you are staying over a garage so there will be noise occasionally. My boyfriend loved the cookies that were provided. Reasonable pricing, Alan was very polite, and accommodating. Overall a great trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Amazingly reasonable price!!! Didn't inflate cleaning or service fees. Friendly host and friendly family! Children were very polite and respectful. Alan was very proactive with communication and covered all matters, including messaging me on Saturday to say he wouldn't be available, but left a person to reach for electrical or plumbing issues. Couldn't ask for a better host and experience! Future possible guests should be aware that they are staying over a sometimes-active garage and workspace that was quiet during 'normal' quiet hours. Thanks for a wonderful stay which included delicious fresh bread waiting for consumption upon arrival!!"

Stayed with a pet","This place has a rustic cabin feel. It is kind of like glamping.
It has a beautiful deck, which overlooks two ponds, sheep, and pigs. This was our favorite part of the place. There is a walkway and space to take your dogs out.
It has a washer and dryer in the bathroom. It also has a large TV with Roku attached. The beds were comfortable, and there was enough space for our family of four as well as our dog.
The family was super friendly. There were adorable wiener dogs that announced our arrival. They were quiet at night though.
It definitely is farm life, which some may like and some may not. There is animal poop pretty much everywhere—including the parking area. We never noticed a smell in loft or even on the deck.
It is a great value."

We loved the giant sectional in the living room and the big screen TV with streaming channels. It was only 3 miles to town for restaurants and groceries. I gave it 5 stars. The only thing I want to warn parents about is that the bedroom does not have a door. If you want privacy from your kids while vacationing, this is not the AirBNB for you."

They are extremely friendly, accommodating and accepting. Stayed at many places over the years from bnb, can't recommend either of their places enough.
I'm a DN, the cell based internet is a minimum of 10Mbs at both. So enough to do most jobs and have clear video conferencing. Hasn't went down so far in snow or rain. The recliners are great at both if that's your style."

Stayed over a week","Amazing place, highly recommend. Have stayed at both their places now.
I'm a DN and generally stay at places for a few months at a time and loved it out there, already booked again for another 3 months.
Pros:
Comfy chairs/beds
Great heating/AC
Quick hot water
Beautiful views from the covered patio
Good internet ~15mbs
Huge TV
Very friendly people.
Cons:
Spiral staircase can be a challenge for some
There are a number of kids which can make noise, but it was never bad.
Side note:
It is country life, so you will have nature around. Allergies can be worse than in the city.
Highly recommend staying here over the hotels in town."

The bed was comfortable, kitchen well equipped, living room with a great TV and excellent WiFi, and spacious bathroom including a washer and dryer. The view from the balcony of the pond with its many ducks was so beautiful. Highly recommend booking you AirBnB lodging at Alan's peaceful paradise!"

We were greeted with fresh baked bread and jam which was so good. It was great to have a kitchen to cook dinners in. We will definitely want to stay here again the next time we come to Holiday World. We did not have time to explore the farm but the view from the deck was beautiful.

After coming off of a 2.5 week long belated graduation trip out west to national parks, this was our final stop before heading to our home in Cleveland area, Ohio. After seeing the previous reviews, and pictures, we were sold! As part of our group headed to Holiday World, which was just a short 25 minute drive, it was a great place to lay our heads for one final night of vacation. Alan and his wife were very helpful and gracious. The space was extremely clean, comfortable, and welcoming; including some delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies! Great communication from the host family, and the willingness to help carry items up the spiral staircase. If I return to the area, I will be sure to stay at this beautiful loft again! Thank you again!!!!"

Memories of my childhood summers with my grandparents on their country farm were always just a glance away. John and I enjoyed early morning and late evening walks along the farm road, watching the animals and listening to the birds. My favorite sounds were the ducks, especially the mallards. Doves joined us for coffee on the porch early in the morning. Our host family spoiled us with homemade cookies, bread and raspberry jam. If you are looking for a restful vacation spot, this is it."

The loft is above a pole barn, and faces the back of the farm property overlooking 2 ponds. Everything was available that we needed and more! They had fresh homemade bread waiting for us when we arrived and other snacks provided. This place was so clean and unique. I was so impressed with everything! The only thing that could be an issue for some is that you access the loft by climbing a spiral staircase, so it might be difficult to carry large items up, such as a cooler, but there's a fridge, so that's not really necessary. Otherwise, I recommend this place highly!"

We spent lots of time hiking the trails (I found an amazing walking stick:), sitting on the porch drinking coffee and reading, sitting at the fire pit, playing games, warming up in the hot tub, and just hanging out inside this amazingly cozy home.

The house is a gem - it’s the lake house in the woods everyone wishes they had! The location is remote enough to feel secluded in the woods and yet close enough to be downtown French Lick in literally 60 seconds. I’ll bet this place is gorgeous at every time of the year. The house is brand new. So everything is super nice. The appliances are all new and flawless. The washer and dryer were clutch as we were going to the water park.
The house was stocked with toiletries, great soaps and shampoos. Good stuff too, way better than a hotel. The towels were also amazing.
We will certainly be looking Jason up the next time we are planning a vacation to French Lick. I can definitely see this becoming a place we go regularly."

Stayed with a pet",I would like to say that we were very excited to go. We got there and we have two small dogs she did not control her bigger dog than ours and he ran up and I was concerned there would be an issue. She never left her house and did not bother to do anything. Then when we were laying in bed there was bugs. We contacted her before contacting customer service. Her responses basically it's not my problem it's your default. We tried to get her to do something she didn't. Now she makes up other things why she didn't. We wanted to leave and asked her for a refund. She said she wouldn't give a refund because it's a business and proceeded to tell us she couldn't take care of things because she had surgery and Young kids. She was only 20 ft away. I would say stay away. Also she had an Amtrak on the counter behind the coffee machine.

Stayed one night","We’ve stayed before for an event in French Lick last winter and it was peaceful for sure but very empty. Samantha has added new furniture to make it feel less empty and we really liked seeing the changes that were made! The air conditioner is easy to use and you can set it however you like. We really liked how quiet it was. The phone service is terrible but her WiFi is top notch! Very fast and with iPhones the phone service wasn’t an issue because they can call and text on wifi. I would 100% recommend this stay and with it being our second time down there I’m sure there will be another trip and as long as it’s available, this is where we will stay. 😊"

It is a clean and spacious alternative to a hotel. I particularly enjoyed its proximity to Patoka Lake. It was nice to wake up and drive just a few miles down the road for a morning hike on the Federal Property at Patoka Lake. I appreciated Samantha placing some of her fresh eggs in my refrigerator. They made a great breakfast!

The host couldn’t have been more welcoming. 👍👍

Stayed one night","Spacious area for all your traveling luggage. Nice shower with a seat. Comfortable bed! The tv worked but with it not being a smart tv or having a Roku or fire stick plugged in there was nothing to watch which was totally okay with me as I was ready for bed but my husband was a little disappointed that he couldn’t watch tv. She is however working on getting that fixed for the next guest!
The kitchen area has a full sized fridge great for drinks or storing dinners leftovers for the night. There is a table to eat at! Only one bed so it’s not good for more than a couple or a couple with a small child like we have. (We have a 3 year old). With the space we did recommend maybe adding a pull out couch for more sleeping space for bigger families.
Samantha was very responsive and was flexible with our late arrival time. She also made sure the light was on for us since we got in late. I’d recommend the place for a person or couple passing through that needs somewhere to sleep but it is not currently able to hold bigger families."

Stayed with kids","If you’re looking for a private getaway, this is a fabulous place! The property is gorgeous, and the house has lots of space. Our kids loved the lake, paddle boat, and hot tub. The house had lots of space to spread out in plus a beautiful porch to just sit and rest. The shaded area around the house is wonderful to just sit and relax in. Tyson is very responsive and responds almost immediately through the Air BnB app. He was great to work with.
A couple of key things to know:
1.) The house does not have Wi-Fi. It’s in the listing, but I missed it. We only had about two bars of signal the entire time we were there.
2.) There are lots of taxidermy animals heads in the house. It shows up some in the pics.
3.) There is no dishwasher or garbage disposal. The grill was not working when we were there so plan ahead for your meals.
We will return for a space that is wonderful to just chill in and get away from it all. We had a wonderful time."

The hot tub was SO relaxing. The place was spotless! It had a fully stocked kitchen so we could cook/eat in.
The views are amazing!
Our cell service was in and out at the cabin but that is exactly what we were looking for.
We checked out Washington and French Lick during our stay, both of which are great places to eat and grab groceries and were within a 15-20 min drive.
Tyson is an excellent host! We had very clear directions on getting to the place and clear instructions for check-in/out.
Our previous host had canceled on us just hours before our scheduled trip. We stumbled onto Tyson's place and with just a couple hours notice, he had his place prep and ready for us!! We could not be more thankful for all he did for us to still be able to enjoy our weekend get-away!
Highly recommend! Would definitely return!"

I don’t know that any pictures could do this place justice. We brought kayaks to take on the pond to fish and lots of firewood for the evenings. (The bonfire area is lit with string lights) We golfed at the Country Oaks Golf Club and ate at the Gasthof Amish buffet, all within 15-20 minutes from the cabin. Overall, we had a fantastic stay.
Tyson was very easy going and quick to reply to any questions; I would highly recommend staying at his property."

My two year old loved spending time in the basement and playing with all the rocks around the beautifully maintained yard! My 9 month old daughter loved swinging on the porch swing in the mornings.
This home is well-maintained and includes any and everything you could need for your stay! My husband forgot his toothbrush and there were new toothbrushes for our convenience! We enjoyed the plush bathroom towels, all the amenities for the kids and the price point was perfect! Michael was so accommodating and even offered to help with anything we may need around town. We appreciated all of this so much! Thank you for your hospitality!"

We've been traveling here from the east coast for almost 10 years now and really appreciated having a lot more space to spread out beyond our typical hotel room, and still a very easy and scenic drive to Holiday World. Had a tiny bit of trouble at the beginning of our stay but a quick phone call to Michael fixed the issue right away. Basement is a bit chilly even in June, but that could be a good thing if you're looking to cool down after a hot day! Nice large TV in basement - can plug in your own devices or use built-in apps. Upstairs living room was also very comfortable. Kitchen had all the essentials and allowed us to cook a few meals to save on eating out. Also a nice patio with grill, table w/umbrella, chairs, and even a smoker! (didn't have time to try that one out). Overall an excellent stay and host - looking forward to another stay in the future!"

The basement is chilly but it’s very large, where more air mattresses or beds could be placed if needed. The house is located right in front of the hospital so I was worried it would be noisy, but I heard not one sound coming from there. We have family in Jasper, so I would stay here again if our budget allows."

Nicely decorated, cute little apartment.
Would not stay with children under 10 or who make noise.
The small space was fine but it should be noted that there were no other children seen in the complex, and apparently we received a noise complaint on Sunday morning.
Re: privacy - There was a motion-triggered security camera at the top of the outside stairs in the neighboring apartment, so in order to enter the apartment, the security camera captured my family. Unavoidable.
Host agreed this was not a good fit."

The air conditioner is incredibly loud in the living room. It wasn’t that bad unless we wanted to watch tv then we had to turn it off.

My son and I enjoyed having our coffee out by the gazebo in the mornings and about all you could hear was the birds and an occasional car going by. We also enjoyed the family pictures depicting the homestead that was across the street. There were pamphlets with information on what to do in the area.

Definitely would stay again. Hotels never allow us the space we need with our oldest teen. We dont want him in a seperate room but he also needs privacy and we never know how quiet they will be. This was a perfect place for us!"

Stayed with kids","Our family had a fantastic time at the homestead. The home was large and had everything we were looking for in a great home away from home. The kids loved playing in the basement with the board games and toys. There was plenty of space for everyone to spread out, but large enough community spaces that we could all come together comfortably. We also enjoyed spending time outside away from the town/city. We appreciated the special touches -- like setting up the pack-n-play in advance, the extra snacks, and keurig -- that took this stay one step above the average. Thanks again for letting us stay at your long-held family property."

Stayed about a week","The ""Hoosier Homestead"" was a wonderful place to stay while on our family vacation to the southern Indiana area. I grew up on a small dairy farm near a very small town in Northwest Ohio, so any vacation with a farm and small town setting is perfect for us. My husband, children, their families and I, really enjoy the view of rolling fields and the small town of St. Anthony. We enjoyed the vintage pictures around the house, which gives a very sentimental journey back in time when life was simple. The basketball hoop, fire pit, grill, pergola and yard was used much for nighttime entertainment. Your location was perfect for all are daily travels like, Holiday World, Abraham Lincoln Homestead etc... Thanks for sharing your ""Hoosier Homestead""!!! P.S....The food at Rosie's Tavern was very good!! :)"

This house is far enough from town to feel like you are truly in the country. However, Jasper is very interesting and not far away if you want to explore a unique town in Indiana. This particular location is very historic. We very much want to stay here again when we go back to Indiana. Thanks, Lynn!"

Stayed a few nights","We found Lynn's place after our original host that we had booked with canceled our reservation the day before we were to check in due to an unexpected issue. It was a last minute booking with Lynn but it couldn't have went any smoother.
Walking in to the Hoosier homestead was like going to Grandma's house. We immediately felt like we were at home because it was so comfortable and welcoming. You know how every time you go somewhere on a trip you always forget something? No worries if you're staying at Lynn's place, because there is literally everything you would need. As a matter of fact we even made a game of it. Chopsticks were the only thing we couldn't find, so definitely bring your own chopsticks if you're going to need those :)
Anyway, if you're looking for plenty of room, the comforts of home, privacy, and responsive friendly hosts, stay at the Hoosier Homestead!"

There are not many options and what there is closes early (around 8PM). 2- If you are using this property as place to stay for visiting Holiday World remember that HW is on CST and the house is on eastern. I guess our phones didn't update the night we got there so the next morning we showed up to HW an hour before the park opened. It made for a good laugh and good parking spot. Neither thing has any baring on the quality of the stay, which was great, just tips for future renters."

I was a little apprehensive about staying that far, but there wasn't many options available, that close, at a great value, and for the size of our family. I'm so glad I chose her home. The surroundings were very tranquil. When we arrived there was fresh baked cookies waiting for us...yum! Lynn's home has a lot of family history and it was peaceful, comfy, homey, and cozy. She also provides everything a family needs from the fully stocked kitchen, blankets and board games. My children enjoyed gazing at the cornfields and the pecan trees. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely rebook."

Newly renovated cabin on the grounds in addition to the main house. We were happy to have 7 bedrooms in total. We had privacy, beautiful grounds, fire pit and a large kitchen table that seated I think 14! Temperature in the home was perfect, every bed was comfortable, everything you could need was there. We had 13 people staying on the grounds and another 12 friends/family staying nearby but coming over for meals and of course the Leeclipse!! We golfed, went to the bowling alley, had dinner at the Schnitzelbank restaurant and a beautiful sit down dinner at Sultan’s Run. Chris was responsive from start to finish!! We were in constant contact with Whitney, from the tourism board who gave us a billboard to celebrate Lee!! There were gift bags too for my whole group! The local radio/tv station even did a story on us! It was perfect!!"

Stayed with kids","We loved staying at Chris' place and only wish we could have stayed longer! It was a perfect spot for our family Christmas gathering with plenty of space for everyone in the family to sleep. I have stayed at many Airbnbs, and this one was by far the cleanest! I was pleasantly surprised with how well kept it was, and it made for a very comfortable stay. The view is beautiful and so serene! We enjoyed having the firepit and corn hole for the family. We can't wait to stay at Chris' place again!"

Group trip",This was one of the best golf trips we have ever planned. A big part of that was bc of the customer service we got from Chris and the staff . The course took great care of us and the house was absolutely stunning. We have already picked dates to come back and stay at the same spot next year. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 10/10

Stayed with kids","The house was very nice. Chris was responsive to our issues. I think this house would be perfect for a group of golfers that wanted to share expenses and enjoy the week or weekend as a place to sleep. To be fair, the listing did not say the house was family friendly so perhaps it was not the best choice for our family vacation with a combination of kids and adults. There is no place for kids to play outside (but the fire pit was a big hit) and no inside amenities other than TVs. The rooms were nice and we did not need the 5th bedroom but it would not have been optimal since it was in a different building. The kitchen is nice but is missing some items such as cookie sheets and a pitcher to make tea. Our biggest issue was that the hot tub had not been treated and the water smelled and was dirty. The spa guy came the next day and he said they test it every week but I find that very hard to believe.
Again, beautiful house - for adults."

Vicki & her husband (whose name escapes me) were fabulous hosts. Truly nice people!
The space was great & met our needs. Found the kitchen to be stocked with everything one needs and the beds were super comfortable.
The outdoor space was the star of the show! We brought 2 dogs and they had the time of their lives in the completely fenced in area, which surrounded a cute lil lake. We stayed for the 2024 eclipse and they were gracious in accommodating our early check in and offered up the backyard for us to enjoy. It was an unforgettable experience and we are grateful for opportunity to let our pups free range it, while we enjoyed nature’s beauty."

They shared sites to see, restaurants, invited us to join with their family functions, we truly felt welcomed, safe and a home away from home. We did not need anything, the kitchen was very well equipped, plenty of linens and everything was perfect! We had a lovely time and if you are on the fence about staying here, don't be, such a lovely, clean place and GREAT hosts!!! Thank you Vicki and Phil.

We actually ended up taking a kitty that had begun coming around! The hosts were kind, helpful, and communative. One of the most helpful/impressive thing was that they built a fire in their backyard, and was built really well. It burned for hoursss. We made smores using their pokers which they kindly provided us.
Thanks for the stay!"

The ages of our group ranged from 5 to 78 and everyone was happy with it. They went above and beyond on accommodations and were a saving grace for our large group to be able to have somewhere nice, clean, safe, and comfortable place for us to rest for the night-- honestly, after seeing the place I definitely wish we could have stayed even longer. 10/10 recommend!"

The home is nestled in a wooded area with a private path to a Pakota Lake inlet. So it’s a short walk to take the kayaks and enjoy a trip on the lake. We loved the hot tub after a day of kayaking and hiking on nearby paths and there was a fire pit for marshmellow roasting in the evening. The interior of the home looked brand new and had a nice lounging area to watch movies before heading to comfy beds. Ashley was extremely responsive both before and during our stay for a few general questions. We really had a nice time and would recommend Lakeview Falls.

We were welcomed with friendly waves from locals on the way in. Original wooden beams are charming with the updated kitchen, bathroom, flooring, furniture. There is one private bedroom (small, but fits the bed and suitcases). The other room on the first floor has a door to separate from the others on the first floor, but is accessible by those in the upstairs loft. Loft has 4 beds. Kitchen is well stocked. No dishwasher, but great big farm sink complete with garbage disposal. Bathroom is beautifully updated! Ashley provides towels galore and fresh white linens - all professionally folded. Great pillows on the beds. There were only 6 of us, but we hosted another family for dinner and church totaling 14. Plenty of room for 3 cars and everyone in the family room for gathering. The deck is great! Ashley has thought of all the details."

We saw that he had a fire pit before we went out for dinner and he got it started for when we got back. We asked him if he wanted to join us by the fire and that entire night we got to know each other and had the best conversations with him! Aaron’s Airbnb is perfect for anyone who wants privacy and/or if you want to be social! We were very sad to leave because it was so homey!

Stayed about a week","This is a jewel of place! Quiet, spacious, and comfy!!
I spent 10 days for work, and truly enjoyed the comfort of this place. It is unexpectedly more lovely than the photos could show. And Irene is a phenomenal host - incredibly responsive on even the smallest things. She made a special trip to drop off a steamer basket for my vegetables.
I have a back that requires a lot of TLC, and I was delighted in the ways that this place pampered it. The master has a “Goldilocks” bed - it’s just right!! It is the best bed I’ve slept in - both hotel and owner rental - in 3 years. Also, the pair of recliners in the living room were so comfortable to read and relax in.
The other issue I have is a sensitivity to mold and mildew. I had ZERO problems the whole time I was staying, even when I was in the basement for laundry. There is a dehumidifier running in the basement, which I’m sure helps.
Irene has thought of many little things that make the stay feel more like home. There were sound machines in each bedroom, night lights, plenty of Kleenex, tp, soap, shampoo, etc. The kitchen was very well equipped (TWO crockpots!). And the washer and dryer looked practically new and handled huge loads.
This house is family-friendly, with a play area set up in the basement. There is a power-lift recliner chair in the living room, if you have someone who needs assistance in getting up. Plus there is a grab bar for getting out of the shower. Be aware, however, that there are steps on both entrances to the house.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. A drawback is having only one bathroom - but it is spacious and lovely, with a tub that both accessible and comfortable. Another issue I had was there wasn’t enough internet to sustain my Zoom meetings - however, I expect that when the WiFi password gets re-established that this problem will vanish.
Just as an FYI, the IGA is close by and does pick-up orders with no minimum and no fees. I chose to stay in an AirBnb so that I could make my own meals and avoid eating in restaurants as a Covid precaution. It was easy to pick up my groceries on the way to the house.
Another coworker stayed at a local hotel and paid $35 more a day and got far, far less than I did!"

Stayed with kids",My family of six stayed here while visiting Holiday World and we could not have been more pleased! Highly recommend staying here. Irene was prompt to get back with any questions we had and the rental was extremely clean. The kids loved playing in the backyard and the neighborhood was beautiful. We will be back again and will recommend to our friends and family!

There were toys and books for kids and plenty of extra sleeping space. There were blackout curtains and sound machines in every bedroom! This was huge for us with small kids who can't sleep unless it's pitch black with white noise! I can't recommend this place enough! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Clear instructions were left for us along with suggestions of places to visit. We didn’t need many of their “extras” but the home was well stocked with things from fans to high chairs. We wished that our stay had been longer so we could’ve had advantage of the outdoor space and bikes there. If we return for another Holiday World visit, we would definitely like to stay there again!"

It was nice to kayak and paddle boat, the lake is smaller than I expected and not exactly water I would want to swim in but it was nice to be on the water and nice to admire.
The host was very personable and responsive and gave awesome recommendations for exploring and food. We were all very happy here!"

Group trip","Our family has been traveling to Holiday World for years! We have stayed at several different places, and pretty sure the group vote would put this place at the #1 spot. Having the yard, pond, playset, and trampoline gave the grandchildren things to do while waiting on the adults to cook, clean, or get ready to go to the park (instead of standing around asking when we were leaving. LOL This is the first year that we just went to the park one day of the holiday weekend - which meant a full day of swimming, kayaking, paddle boat rides, and just down time! The close proximity to Walmart (seriously - from stepping out the door of the home to walking into the store was less than 5 minutes) meant we could grab groceries as we needed them, and at the end of our stay - we didn't have a fridge full of food we never used. We will be back!"

Even though we weren’t there long, the views were incredible and the house felt like home even after one night! Finding it was a little tricky but made for good fun/laughter amongst our party.

The lake is pretty and there was a lot of room outside for the kids to run around. Great for a family reunion or get together with a large group. We would definitely stay here again!"

Bridget's place is only a mile or two outside of town, so access to restaurants and so forth was a breeze. Holiday World (where we spent our time during the day) is about half an hour away, an easy drive down 162.
I would recommend Bridget's place if you're looking for a comfy place for some downtime while in Jasper, it was great and we enjoyed it. Thanks!"

Stayed with kids","Our group had four young kids and six adults. We stayed here after a visit to Holiday World so that we wouldn’t have a long drive immediately after a long day of play. The house accommodated all of us well. Bridget was also very responsive and gave us an extra hour to check out which was very helpful. She also let us know we forgot my daughter’s special stuffed rabbit and we were able to go back and get him. The house was very nice and clean and there were things for the kids to do. The lake is also a lovely view. If we were able to stay longer (we arrived pretty late in the evening), the kids would have loved to play outside more. Overall, a great stay and we would stay here again."

It is a very peaceful location, but very close to Jasper and all the amenities of a city. We plan to use this as our ""base camp"" whenever we come to visit our relatives in the area. The only negative at all, which is very minor, is that it was a little challenging to determine the right driveway to turn into. But ultimately, that was not a big deal. The view and the property were worth it! I would highly recommend staying here!"

Home is great, we had everything we need and even more. Bridget provided us with smallest details we need for our stay and responded within seconds. For those who have kids, they definitely will be busy, there are playground and a lot of toys."

Stayed with kids","We went to Holiday world for a Family Vacation with 3 Adults and 3 Kids. Bridget's place was an AMAZING jumping off point for our long weekend. The place was better than photos, amazing sunset, and lots of nature to enjoy. We hung out on the back patio most nights and enjoyed all the amenities of the city but being surrounded by the country.
The showers were hot, good pressure, and we even made a family dinner in the well stocked kitchen with brand new pans, knives, and plenty of plates for the whole family. I've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's and most come with goodwill pans. Bridget's place was stocked for success.
Bridget was very friendly and offered some food suggestions and even reached out to us our first night cause there were storms expected in the area.
Overall a REALY Great stay and we're already looking at dates for next year to go back. Thanks Bridget for opening up your amazing property for my family and me to build some memories!"

Stayed with a pet","This location was a meeting place for my wife, our daughter, and I, my in-laws, and my parents. We met here and was able to enjoy games and the beautiful scenery.
One day we split and my wife daughter and I went to Holiday World and Lincoln State Park. The older ones went to visit West Baden/French Lick area. We thought it was a great location right between the ventures.
Though it is in the country surrounded by fields, if we needed anything we discovered that Walmart is only about a mile away.
My daughter of 8 yrs old loves fishing for bluegill, paddle boating, and the random sweet outdoor cat that pops up every once in a while.
This is a place we will remember and hope to come back to in the future."
