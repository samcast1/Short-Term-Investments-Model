Stayed with a pet","We loved the house and the location! We were in Toledo for a graduation and family visit, but wanted a place of our own where we could include our dog. This place is perfect! It was very easy to get to our family and do all of the things we wanted. Such a comfortable house, super clean, firm, but comfortable bed, nice fenced in back yard and easy to find. We don't venture down to TOL very often anymore, but this is where we would like to stay any time we return. I have absolutely nothing negative to report!"

The wi-fi was very fast at 210 Mbps download and 285 Mbps upload so I had absolutely no issues teleconferencing into work. Only the nearby train tracks with trains passing during the night took a bit of getting used to---but Lisa's AirBnb remains my top pick for Toledo.

Stayed with a pet","Originally my stay would been two weeks. I knew that I was in love with this amazingly quiet neighborhood & home when a month and a half had went by and myself and puppy were still here! :-) The host Miss Lisa, is absolutely one of the best hosts I’ve ever encountered and I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s From coast to coast… I was her first Airbnb client, although by her professionalism, you couldn’t tell! :-) I believe it was the third day I arrived. My puppy was laying in the back in the laundry room, where the sun cascades in through the storm door, and he went sniffing around, and either his paw or nose accidentally turned the water heater down. So, I messaged Miss Lisa and three minutes later she responded to my Airbnb message I was quite taken aback. She went on to say she would “be here in 15 min.“ and yet again to my surprise she was here in 7 min. And had figured out it was the Dial and had it turned back up within 2. Min. I wish I could rent this listing all year! FrFr :-)
Thank You!"

I was ideal for us since the course/park was only 5 minutes (by car) away. We recommend her home to anyone looking for a pleasant place to stay in the State Park area. It was also close enough to Toledo and Oregon retail and restaurants as well.

Stayed one night",It was peaceful. I thought by looking at the photos we would be close enough to walk down to the water. That was my assumption so my fault. It was cozy and just felt like home. She is very welcoming and being in someone elses home sometimes is hard to sleep but we slept great the beds were comfortable! Close enough to drive and get food and come back. The area is quiet and relaxing! Thank you for a girls night away! We enjoyed also reading the share your thoughts books! What a great idea and very exciting to read others memories!

Stayed a few nights","Victoria has a great place! Clean, QUIET, STUNNING lake views! Made friends with the property owner next door who graciously allowed us to get a closer view of the lake (ask first!). Everything was thoughtfully arranged and aestheticially pleasing. No central air, but two window units and fans will keep you cool and comfy. Had a great time spending time with my hubby and my nephews whom I do not get to see often-- this home made it so that we could provide them a memorable experience. ❤️ If cleanliness, privacy, peace, and beauty is what you're searching for, then you will have zero worries. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","Charming quick respite from the city. Beautifully appointed cottage and so homey.
I needed a dose of those great lake breezes and even though you are not directly on the lake the breeze is still felt especially when sitting on the back porch.
Enjoyed the Maumee Bay shoreline. Feeling recharged. Usually have only seen Ohio from the vantage point of the Interstate so it was a pleasure to actually visit Ohio.
First night we ate at the Oregon Inn at the end of the street. A small restaurant that has probably been serving the locals for years and years. They have a good selection of classic beef and fish dishes.
Just goes to show you don’t have to travel far from home in Detroit, to feel like you’ve explored faraway places!
Thank you to Victoria, the perfect host!"

Unfortunately it rained most of the time so we weren't able to walk around, only to the restaurant. It was very hot when we arrived and it was so nice to walk in to an air-conditioned cottage. Bed was comfortable. It was very very peaceful. Never heard a car or anything from the neighbors. I would highly recommend Beauty by the Bay. Victoria is an excellent host."

After long days chasing warblers, we returned to comfortable beds and a hot shower in a peaceful neighborhood steps from the water. The cottage is as you see it in the pics - clean, bright, and nicely decorated. The WiFi was good. We didn't use too many of the kitchen supplies, but it had what we needed and seemed better stocked than some of the other places we've rented with ""fully-equipped"" kitchens. We appreciated the full-size fridge and ample pantry space. Check-in was smooth. Victoria contacted us to make sure everything was going well and responded to our questions.
For the location and quality, the price is quite reasonable."

Stayed with kids","Beauty by the Bay was the perfect stopover during my family's holiday travels. We loved that it was not far off the Ohio Turnpike yet gave us a quiet lakeside retreat. An unexpected bonus was the chance to pass through the industrial landscape of Toledo on our way to the cottage, which is tucked in a very cute bay-side community. Even for a brief overnight stay, the house is a good value. Having a separate bedroom (with bunk beds!) for our young kids, a living area with small dining table, a washer and dryer, and a kitchen with full-size fridge was worth every dollar. Plus we had a great host! Victoria was welcoming and helpful but also let us do our own thing. A very good experience all the way around."

Stayed a few nights","It's very nicely decorated - cute, bright and charming; we really liked the blinds! The amenities were minimal and very basic. Unfortunately although the furniture looks nice, it was not at all comfortable to sit or sleep on. Also, the bunk beds were noisy and disruptive to sleep. It seems like the most comfortable bed was the queen bed so if that's all you plan to use you should be okay. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the airbnb or plan to do a lot of cooking, this might not be the one for you. Not sure if the turnover was rushed or what, but it seemed like some things that may normally get done were lacking (ex: the soap in the bathroom was empty upon arrival; dust/cobwebs on the fans and some other cleanliness issues in the kitchen as well). It was a very quiet neighborhood but still close to Maume Bay State Park and downtown Toledo, which was really nice. The host was responsive to needs and provided what was lacking in relatively short order. It was disappointing to learn that although you can see the water from the house, it's not actually on the water nor can you access the water from the house. Also, be advised that the Air Conditioning is only supplied by window units and there isn't one in the bunk bed room. Wifi was somewhat spotty. Easy access to Oregon Inn (a nearby restaurant), in unit laundry, off street parking, great cancellation policy, and access to major streaming services were some nice features of this listing."

Shirley was an active part of why it went so well for us, always careful to make sure we had what we needed, had clear instructions for everything including the rather complicated TV and multi mode lighting, and just going above and beyond to make our stay special.
The location itself was situated in a sleepy suburb just a few minutes from downtown Toledo, with easy access to the interstate and all the shopping and activities one could hope for. The decorations were a carefully selected and curated collection of sailing themed things of all shapes and sizes, with every piece feeling like a personal addition with real heart and soul. The room was quiet and the furniture very comfortable, an inviting change from any hotel. Everything we could have needed was provided for us and in excellent shape.
You will be hard pressed to find a more comfortable place to stay in Toledo Ohio. We cannot recommend this enough. 6 out of 5 stars."

I highly recommend staying at Shirley’s if you are looking for an Airbnb that feels like home. Both the bed and roll-out bed were very comfortable! We all woke up talking about how that was the best sleep of our lives lol.
The sunroom and patio are absolutely adorable as well! We also tried a local restaurant recommended by our host (Ye Dirty Bird) and it was excellent!! All around the best Airbnb experience any of us have had. (:"

Stayed a few nights","The Captains Quarters space is very comfortable and clean. There are many thoughtful additions designed for the comfort and convenience of the guest. The bedroom/living room is fully finished and decorated with a beautifully whimsical nautical theme. You can almost smell the sea air. The kitchenette/workspace has some ductwork overhead a person over 5' 10"" would have trouble clearing. Additionly, a person over 275lbs would be uncomfortable in the shower stall and upstairs bathroom. At 5'6"" 185# I was a perfect fit for this economical, safe, clean unit convenient to my needs and a 10-15 min commute to Promedica or St Vincents hospitals respectively. Great, restful spot for nightshift healthcare workers to wind down after a busy shift. Thank you, Shirley!"

Stayed one night","Shirley's place was very nice. Easy to find and easy check in. However I do want to mention a few things that were unique to my situation, just to make others aware.
The basement area (where you stay) is a little musty smelling. The ceilings are also quite low. I'm 6'3"" and I hit my head on the doorway to the shower area and on some duct work numerous times. The stand up shower is very small and is made for people no taller than 5'9"". I had to bend my knees the entire time in the shower just so I could stand. The solid shower door opens inward, which makes it very difficult to get in and out. This is just something to keep in mind if you are taller or bigger than average.
Also, while I was asleep an alarm clock went off at 2:00 am. It was coming from the upstairs/main part of the house, which is locked and guests do not have access to. I knocked on the door and called Shirley twice but no one answered either. The alarm finally shut itself off at 2:45 am. Frustrating!"

Stayed one night","First the positive: Shirley was friendly and responsive. It was extremely easy to let ourselves in using the instructions provided. Things were as described. She has anticipated pretty much everything you would need. Her listing is a great value. But we found numerous long hairs in the shower and there were crumbs in the crease on the couch. From reading other reviews, this seems to be a rare occurrence. Maybe someone was in a hurry or having a bad day. I don't know, but I felt I had to mention it."

Her directions to access the unit were very clear. However, I found it cumbersome to maneuver luggage through the two entry doors, as it is a bit of a tight squeeze.
The unit was clean and the bed very comfortable. The shower is a bit small, however it worked fine for me.
All in all, it was a good stay."

Stayed a few nights","Shirley’s place was acceptable for what I needed: just a place to crash for the night. The studio is in the basement so the ceiling was low, less than the standard 8’. The bed was very comfortable. She had fresh milk in the refrigerator and snacks available so that was a nice touch. The studio had its quirks. For example, the two doors you have to go through to get into the studio open to the inside, so it was kind of tight to get by both doors. But overall it was a decent place to stay. Shirley’s check in instructions were clear and I enjoyed being able to check in at any time."

Quiet area, easy location, easy parking. Shirley is GREAT at communicating on every level! She really is just a text away if you need anything.
The best way to describe Shirley’s place, is like staying at a aunts house, and they have made sure you’re going to be completely comfortable. 🙂
The apartment upon entering, smelled wonderful! Like fresh laundry clean. , fully stocked (more than ANY hotel would have) she had all kinds of movies (very kid friendly also) and tons of snacks/ condiments/ personal items in case you forget anything. Shirley goes WAY beyond what any host is obligated to. I just can’t stress this enough, she thought of everything! For the price, it’s beyond worth it!
We would absolutely 100% recommend Shirleys place if you’re a couple, or with a child, as the space is cozy and private.
This will be our future in town spot to stay!
Thanks, Shirley for being such a great host!

Great place to knock out some emails and work stuff... before retiring to the main room for a good night's sleep. Maybe it was the calm lighting, maybe it was the comfortable bed, maybe it's just that certain Midwestern magic of sleeping in a nice warm basement... I woke up unusually relaxed and ready.

Her home is within 10-15 min driving distance of anything in the city. If going to Toledo, Shirley's home away from home is the place to lay your head."

Stayed one night","Shirley was a fantastic host! Super responsive and friendly, and very accommodating. We had a few valuables with us that we didn’t want to leave in our car, so she allowed us to leave our bags long after check out.
The space itself was absolutely perfect for our needs as well! Clean, comfortable, and filled with thoughtful touches everywhere (including a basket of snacks and a variety of toiletry items). We loved the “captain” theme as well!
It’s worth noting the shower and toilet are separated (with the toilet and sink located at the front door upon arrival and the shower located downstairs with the rest of the suite). This was hardly an issue, however.
I’d definitely recommend Shirley’s place to anyone looking to spend a few days in the Toledo area, especially if you plan on visiting the zoo as she was a short ride away."

So unfortunately we didn't have a lot of time to spend at this amazing location! We would have loved to have met Shirley and her cute doggy!
Shirley is a fantastic host who has thought of everything! If you have forgot something for your trip, Shirley has it. She has all tons of snacks/food and all sorts of hygiene products just in case! The space is super homey and she has a great manual that can answer any questions like how to turn on the TV or how to sign into the wifi!
Definitely a 10 our of 10!"

I needed to message them past 10pm &they immediately responded. I appreciated the secure parking in their clean garage that included a remote.

It's a basement apartment but it's SO QUIET! I got in late and left as soon as I got up, but I was sure happy to have such a quiet place to sleep. No noise from anywhere - inside or out - and everything I needed was there, including (yay! all gluten-free for me!) snacks.

Stayed a few nights","First off this is a nice unit. It looks like this is a new unit. You can tell that these folks put thought, time and money into it. It is a basement unit but all is clean with no mold smell. None of those tiny windows. It stays cool during the hot day and at night the heat works really well. The bedroom is CPAP friendly with a number of outlets around the bed. Bed was comfy and I slept really well. Liked the bathroom. Love the mirror and walk-in shower. Kitchen was well appointed. Everything that you need and none of the aged food left in the cupboards. The appliances were all in good condition. Living room was basic but tastefully done. The eating table is large so if you need to do some work you got room to spread out. There is also a small, laptop sized work station. The patio and back yard were perfect for enjoying the warmth, cicadas and at night the lighting bugs. Tye and Grace were very communitive and responsive. In the end it was a great stay and would recommend the unit."

Stayed with a pet","Convenient location to all the places we had to get to during our stay! A few minutes away from the zoo, from the university and downtown. We had our pup and having the bike path literally outside the back door was awesome for walking our old lady. Back yard is also fenced in. Neighbors were friendly and always said hi. Place is cute, clean and extremely affordable. It was abnormally warm and muggy on a spring day and the place doesn't have air conditioning. Rooms don't have any ceiling fans and all we were able to find was a tiny 10"" fan which offered very little air circulation. Maybe in the summer they have window units? I did let host know to add more fans. Despite the lack of sleep, I would stay there again because it was cute, quiet and very central for getting around Toledo. Also, Toledo is super awesome. Everyone we met around town was so friendly. We'll totally come back for a weekend! Thank you for having us, we appreciate it!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at many Air BnBs in Toledo, and this one was one of the best! The beds were so comfortable, the stocked coffee and creamer, the fenced backyard, all of it! We were able to take our toddler grandchildren to parks and the zoo easily, and pick dandelions in the backyard every day. We watched the solar eclipse from the driveway. We met nice neighbors out walking, and felt safe the whole time. I think we used every square inch of Megan's place, including letting the little ones play in the basement.
Megan let us know that the cleaners were finished early and we could check in early if we wanted. She was responsive immediately when we had questions.
When my husband and I come back to Toledo (which we do several times a year), this will be the first place we look to book!"

This condo was better than perfect for me: a great neighborhood that was so peaceful where I really was able to relax, unwind and get my energy back.
I also must say that the layout of condo was sublime. Everything (and I mean everything) I needed was included: from a giant bed, with fluffy pillows and the softest blankets to the giant TV's, exercise equipment, and even laundry supplies!

She was super communicative and provided very clear instructions for checking in and out.

It was my first time in Ohio and I was blown away by how lovely Perrysburg was!! I only stayed overnight on my way elsewhere, but I wish I could've stayed longer. Jennifer was extremely helpful and kind. If I can, I'll definitely be staying here again!"

Stayed a few nights","A true oasis! This place has become one of the top AirBnB stays we’ve had. Centrally located to many spots of interest in the greater Toledo (Perrysburg/Maumee) area, easy access to the highways, this apartment had plenty of space to roam inside and out. The entrance faces away from the main house, so plenty of privacy, has it’s own parking carport, and a deck that looks out to the back acre of their tree lined lot. If you’re lucky, a chicken or two might escape their run and be waiting to greet you upon your return.
Inside amenities had everything one should need. Impeccably clean with extra touches like snacks, filtered water, coffee, cooking supplies, and fresh eggs. Sometimes there is a distant train horn or a highway hum but country crickets can be heard as well. Bed is spring mattress so a little bouncy but comfortable. Definitely going to be booking with them again whenever we’re that way."

Bottled water in the fridge and delish chocolate covered pretzels to greet us were a nice touch too. Neighborhood was quiet, and the screened in porch and the shared patio space in a courtyard setting was just lovely and so enjoyable. We have relatives in Toledo and hope to be able to come back often. Thank you Lisa and Scott!"

There is only space to navigate around the bed on one side and the bathroom is between the common area (kitchen, seating) and the bedroom so that in order to move from the common area to the bedroom (or vice versa) you must pass through the bathroom. The entry door is a sliding glass door.

Stayed a few nights","The space was tidy and clean. It was smaller than we'd expected and there was not a tv in the bedroom. The listing didn't mention anything about the tv so it was my fault for not noticing/asking ahead of time.
Overall the place was tidy, neat, and comfortable. It was worth the price paid. I consider it my fault that i didn't notice that it wasn't well-suited for a romantic weekend. The owners communicated and left very clear instructions. I struggled for a few minutes with the lock box, as it was new to me and i wasn't sure how to get in it, so maybe detail that you must push the button down."

The hosts were friendly, responsive and helpful. I would have liked to stay longer but the bedroom in unit 3s was such that noise and conversation from unit 2 was clearly discernible. It might be suitable for someone who works days but certainly not for someone whose sleep/rest time is during the day. Otherwise it’s a great place and I’d recommend it for recreational visits."

You are perfect host!!!
In these times it is very difficult to find places to stay when you travel that take into consideration the fact that some people cannot come in contact with animals, smoke or the fragrances of cleaning or personal care products.
You have been a blessing for us...you just need to expand your portfolio to several other cities!!!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

The location is convenient to shopping and restaurants, and Toledo attractions are easy to get to. The outdoor area at the rear of the property is nice and relaxing. I am returning in September for a family wedding and have already booked unit 2, as there will be three of us.
I visit Toledo at least once a year, and Lisa and Scott's is my first choice. it's obvious that they care about their guests, as the property is well maintained and welcoming. They are friendly people and quick to respond to any questions you may have.
Lisa and Scott, thanks again for another great visit, and we will see you in September!"

There was also extra pillows and blankets and towels. The location was also perfect. Close to everything you might need during your stay! Very happy with the place!"

Everything I needed to do a home cooked meal for my daughter and enjoy some time with her. I will also add great outdoor motion sensing lighting! This unit is at the back but they have great lighting all along the way which is very nice this time of year. I look forward to staying again soon!

We stayed only one night since we were on the way to visit family for the holiday, but it would also be a great place to spend more time, too. Highly recommended. Patricia and Jack Pfitsch"

Stayed a few nights","Lisa and Scott's place was perfect. It was exactly as pictured. It was close to everything I needed. I was in town for family weekend at the University. It was less than 10 minutes to get to campus. The place itself was very clean. I was also concerned about the light coming in the bedroom window from what I saw in the pictures. I was happy to see blackout blinds in the bedroom. Also, one of the nights the neighbors were having a get together and I was concerned they may keep me awake if it went too late. Once inside the house, I heard nothing...so who knows how late they went. There is one of Toledo's metropatks right around the corner. Communication was perfect. Definitely would recommend."

My only complaints were that many of the windows only had thin cloth coverings that kept the place from feeling private, and the walls were very thin so we heard people in the main part of the house (not included in this listing) quite loudly even when they were just talking."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic little find on the north side of Toledo! Our apartment was one of three in the house, but we really never heard the other guests. It was perfect for my wife and I while we were in town for a major golf tournament. It’s exactly as advertised - kitchen and sitting area, bathroom, and bedroom, plus a fantastic screened-in patio and outdoor seating area. It’s right off the highway and there are a ton of restaurants close by. If you are local coffee shop fanatics like we are, there are several within a 10-minute drive. If we find ourselves back in Toledo, I will look to book this place first!"

Comfortable, clean, and everything I needed and more was available inside of the unit. The outside patio had a lovely well maintained space to sit and work, which was so very necessary for me. They went above and beyond, and I felt at home in their place! I highly recommend them as hosts, and I will definitely be booking again!"
