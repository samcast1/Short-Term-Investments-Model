Group trip","We stayed here on one of the coldest and snowiest weekends of the year. The roads were a little icy and snowy, but we made it in alright. Our vehicles couldn’t get out of the driveway the next morning, but Tina was able to let us into the shed where there were some shovels, and we cleared the driveway enough to be able to leave.
We had some issues with the ground floor not being cleaned/mopped recently, but everything else was a great experience just as listed. I believe Tina when she says the cleanliness issue was unexpected, and not the norm for her property. She was a helpful and responsive host. We were dry and warm, and had a great time together with friends."

Group trip","Hazel’s place was perfect. This was our first Hatfield and McCoy trip, so we weren't sure what to expect and where to stay. The location was perfect. If it weren't for rain, our trucks wouldn't have left the spacious parking lot. For most of the trip, we took our ATVs and SXSs everywhere. It was great having trails, restaurants, and stores within riding distance. The accommodations were clean and well-equipped for a group. The parking area had plenty of room for two 20+ foot trailers. Having four bathrooms was great when cleaning up after being on the trails. We also enjoyed hanging with the local cat around the fire pit, enjoying some bourbon and cigars after riding all day."

Highly recommend Hazel’s Place. Thanks Tina and Dean!!"

The kitchen was well stocked and the outside grill worked well for hamburgers and hot dogs. The outside fire pit was also nice as we enjoyed a sit by the fire one night. We had planned to go snow tubing at Winterplace but unfortunately because of the weather, it was canceled. Had we been able to go, Hazel’s place wasn’t a long drive to get there. Overall it was a great family vacation."

Stayed a few nights","Hal’s place was excellent and met our needs perfectly! It was exactly as described but even then, descriptions can make you leery, so it was beyond what we expected. From reservation to checkout Hal was very responsive and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and at home. We were mainly there to sleep and do a small amount of cooking for a birthday celebration we were in town for. Not a lot of extras for cooking but you can get by with what’s there. We planned ahead as I knew what I would be needing for what I was doing. It’s an old home in a historic area, but the modern conveniences added like the keyless entry system, automatic lights, and automatic bathroom fan, made it very convenient and easy to access. This will be our go to place to stay when visiting family in the area!! Definitely worth every penny!! Don’t bypass if you’re looking for a simple extremely clean place for a couple people! Loved it!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first AirBnb experience. We are so glad we chose Hal's place as our maiden voyage. Everything from booking to communication to check in were tip notch! And what an amazing space! An older home converted into multiple apartments and furnished in period furniture yet the kitchen and restroom were 100% updated and modern. The bed, super comfy king with tons of extra blankets just in case. Original floors and other beautiful highlights only an older home can provide! Artwork hanging on the walls showcase his wife Andrea's paintings. What a talented artist! And CLEAN! I had my 1 year old granddaughter for a day and wasn't the least bit concerned about her crawling over the floors. Everything was pristine! Kitchen decked out with every possible thing you'd need to cook at home. I prepared a full spaghetti meal for my kids, including garlic bread and dessert. Didn't lack for anything! Thank you Hal and Andrea for making us feel right at home!💜"

Stayed a few nights","This place is a diamond in the rough. If you like the mountains, it's in the middle of some rugged ones. We spent half of our time on the spacious porch with a mountain view. Other than the occasional dog bark or passing train, it was quiet and we slept well on a nice mattress for three nights. The appointments are rustic, but with a modernized bath and the entrance and parking area are well illuminated.
The street leading to the driveway is steep and is a little challenging when backing out of the parking area. We managed fine in an SUV and there is space for two or more vehicles to park. It's convenient to restaurants, bars, shopping and gas. We felt safe and even went for a run, early one morning in the neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed over a week","I enjoyed my 3-month stay. Hal and Andrea were extremely helpful and friendly, as well as accommodating my schedule as a travel nurse. Their place had everything I needed, including a comfortable bed, plenty of hot water, private parking, on-site laundry, and high-speed internet. They provided great local recommendations that were timely and helpful. This was by far the cleanest place I have ever stayed! A regular cleaning service was provided during my stay, and was second to none. Bluefield is an older coal-mining/railroad town, and the house is in a working-class neighborhood. However, I felt 100% safe at all times. The neighbors I met were friendly, and the views of the surrounding hills were gorgeous during fall. If you are looking for short-term rental in the Bluefield/Princeton area, be sure to reach out to Hal!"

The space was huge and much larger than we expected! The kitchen area was a nice surprise and had anything you could possibly need while visiting. The owner had great communication. We checked-in late at night. The owner helped us navigate the check-in process, as finding the house was a little tricky at night but we had a great map provided to use for check-in which help tremendously. I would definitely stay at this location again if we were ever in the area!"

We very much enjoyed these accommodations while visiting relatives in the area and loved the special creative touches in this spacious setting. Hal and his wife go out of their way to ensure your stay is comfortable and all of the special, personal elements in this historic train yard setting adds such a cozy, welcoming touch.
We enjoyed the extensive information in the guest manual about all of the nearby attractions, the history of the area and special recommendations. We were so pleased with the recommendation to visit the Railyard restaurant for a meal. We had such a delicious dinner and the location was convenient as well.
We loved our stay here and would definitely enjoy a return visit!"

Stayed over a week","So, I have to be completely upfront and say that the Bluefield area was not for me. I had been looking for a place to spend some quiet time close to the mountains while working remotely, but unfortunately this was not it. As a single female traveler, I didn’t feel completely safe in the area. I had gone off previous reviews and booked for a month, but ended up leaving less than halfway through. I am very conflicted in writing this review, and take responsibility for the fact that I wasn’t familiar with the town, but also feel like some additional information would have been helpful as it would have influenced my decision to book.
First let me say, the suite itself was nice - exactly as described, looked newly renovated, clean, and had basically everything one needed. The internet was good for working remotely. Also, the bed was very comfortable as other reviews have said. Hal was responsive and kind. To his credit, he tried to do what he could to make me more comfortable. The only downside was the windows in the unit didn’t open and actually seemed to be sealed shut in some cases. Hal did offer to try to get the windows open, but at that point I knew I wasn’t staying and didn’t want to make him go through the effort for me to then leave.
However, a few things I wish I knew before booking. First, the surrounding area leaves a bit to be desired. There are a lot of boarded up, empty buildings and the neighborhood backs up to a very industrial looking area on a busy street, which made me question the safety of the neighborhood. Unfortunately, AirBnB policy doesn’t require information about the location, but I feel like it is an important aspect of a stay, especially for longer stays. Also, the houses are very close together, much closer than I was expecting. So, even though the house had a nice porch, and you can see the mountains in the distance, sitting out there really only gave you a view of the neighbor’s yards, the empty buildings, and the noise from the busy street. Oh, and please know that the other part of the house is under renovation. I didn’t hear any noise from it but it does mean that it is currently empty.
Not an issue, just an FYI, there is a pretty steep incline to the house. I have an AWD SUV arriving on a clear day and it still gave me some trouble. Be careful if you don’t have AWD or there is inclement weather. But the driveway side is even worse, so definitely use the alley.
Again, these are just some things I would have liked to known, so please take this review in context. If the above items aren’t a concern for you or you are someone who is visiting for a specific purpose and is more familiar with the area, it would most likely be a great stay. It just wasn’t the right fit for me."

Stayed over a week","I ended up staying for several months due to the pandemic. This was the most perfect spot to do just that. It’s a special place stewarded by equally special creative people. I’m surprised how much I loved working in the shadow of one of West Virginia’s first HBC & one of the largest coal train yards in the world. I enjoyed how accessible walking to the campus was from my own private back porch. The route complemented my physical therapy I was in the middle of @ the time. There are routes that are very accessible ADA, so much so that after a few months I got comfortable leaving the cane at home sometimes."

Stayed over a week","You might notice several reviews from me in a row from this property. As a mobile maker Covid has forced me to be still in new ways. This has been the perfect spot to get vaccinated and wait for the world to open back up safely. I have an auto immune disorder, that made Covid all the more frightening to me. I’ve let you know in other reviews how special the property & the owners are. When it snowed often through this West Virginia winter, every time - my driveway, walkway & vehicle were cleaned off when I got up. They made sure I had a home cooked meal on Easter Sunday. They understand & are mindful of Airbnb gentrification & what that means for the immediate community/neighborhood the property is in. That’s something I see ignored on this app constantly, yeah we all have seen the headlines about this apps community impact. I’m grateful to have an opportunity to use this app as ethically as I can. This experience has made me only want to stay / pay hosts that prioritize the integrity of the community their property is in, that see themselves as stewards not income property. I’m grateful that I know that my money is not going to reinforce racist systemic community rhetoric- in fact I know that it’s fighting it. I will definitely come back!"

House smelling so fresh and clean all those little framed reminders around the house are so cute and will put a smile on your face.
Loved the tiny organized clean kitchen too.
We enjoyed our coffee and breakfast every morning quietly and the meals we had in there. Lovely to have the space outside where we can sit chat and watched the kids play too.
We were able to go for a walk around the area and felt safe too. Very easy to get around Bluefield.
Thank you for letting us stay. Will definitely come back.

But I will say Ryan is extremely responsive and was great to work with. This would have been our first Airbnb experience. Should we be through that area again, I would have no hesitation to stay here. It smelled amazing when I walked in to check out the house.

Group trip","Hop's Spot was EXTREMELY CLEAN!! From the front door and throughout!! The bathrooms and bedrooms are Immaculately clean which is always important. The host (Robert) responds immediately to any questions or concerns and was extremely friendly and helpful. They made certain we had everything we needed and was extremely clear to contact them for any reason. The sun porch was really nice and relaxing to enjoy the breeze and watch the deer on the other side of the fence when they were passing by. The only reason anything was a 4 is because they are still doing some updates, which I was clearly advised of even when communicating prior to booking. I would definitely stay again when returning to the area which we plan to do and ride ATVs. If you're looking for a place that's clean, walking distance to stores, relaxing and convenient to ATV rentals, or visiting the area for family (like we were). Hop on in and check them out.. They truly treat you as welcomed guest."

Group trip","This is our 2nd time staying at Tin Roof, and we will definitely be back. The hosts are very responsive, home is very clean and comfortable. Driveway has a slight slope if you’re bringing a big trailer- our first visit we brought 20 foot enclosed and scraped a bit, this time 18 foot deck over and we were fine. If you want to back into the driveway, turn at the poetown road street entrance just past the house, not the entrance at the light like Gps will probably send you. (We learned that the first time). We definitely appreciated the covered parking area for our buggy’s, since it rained a couple days. Home has exterior security cameras which is also a plus for us. If you’re riding- there are plenty of trails around, no need to trailer. Pocahontas trailhead is real close by, along with plenty of other trails. There are stores and restaurants near by, which is very convenient. We will definitely be back!"

Group trip","It was very nice and accommodating for seven people. We detached two trailers and pushed them behind the house which made plenty of room for four trucks and trailers and side by sides. The beds are very hard but the foam pads that they provide optional did help. Conveniently close to town but also very close to route 52 so traffic is a little noisy. I thought it was a fair price for what was offered, we had a great time."

Everything was as advertised in the description. Andrea did provide one inch padding for the beds if you want a little softener. We used the padding and it was nice. Fire pit and charcoal grill are nice addition in that residential neighborhood. Recently beautiful paved road and close to a beautiful state park. We enjoyed ourselves and will be back for another stay. Andrea is very responsive to any questions or suggestions. Thank you.

The property is private, peaceful and beautiful but so close to groceries, restaurants, gas... We were there to ride Hatfield McCoy trails and it is a perfect launching point for four trail systems. The house is gorgeous with a stunning kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen is so spacious and easy to work in. The views are amazing, and you can see out the kitchen windows from the living room. The house is so well equipped and comfortable with an amazing layout. The quality appliances, hardware, lighting and ceiling fans just bring it to the next level as well as thoughtful artwork placed throughout. This is a place you hate to leave for the day but are so excited to come back to. We will definitely return in the future!"

Stayed with kids","BEAUTIFUL RENOVATION of a 1920's cottage with modern designer touches to the last detail! Great views, chirping birds, crisp mountain air and such a lovely cottage with evidence of a well-traveled owner (art & collectables). My husband and I have enjoyed Airbnb's for 7 years and Patrick's cottage has to be the BEST in every way! It had all of the components that make a great Airbnb. In this case - a great California kitchen, nice bath, walk-in closet, privacy, space, comfort and things to do. To me, the place where one stays when traveling is just as important and interesting as the location and amenities of the area. Definitely a creative and multi-talented family made this Airbnb come together for many to enjoy. If you have an admiration for the mountains, animals, beauty and vintage architecture, this is it! It was a pleasure to stay our three nights and we enjoyed conversation with Garland (Patrick's father) who stopped by to make sure we were warm for the coming cooler temps."

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing stay at this beautiful home and beautiful property! The pictures simply do not do it justice. A mixture of country charm, contemporary flair and tasteful decor immediately makes one feel at home. Future guests, the only thing you will need to bring for your stay are your personal belongings, clothing and maybe a flat/curling iron. Patrick has your needs covered from a well-stocked pantry (coffee, spices, and other miscellaneous food items that you may want for cooking during your stay) in the kitchen to a bathroom with a provided hair dryer, walk-in shower, shampoo, body wash, body towels, hand towels, and washcloths. The bathroom itself from its layout to its decor is a work of art. One small suggestion that does not deter from my five star rating (I would give 10 Stars if I could) - if you are not used to road noise, I would suggest closing the windows at night or using earplugs. I would not hesitate to stay here again! Thank you Patrick for an amazing stay!!"

Stayed about a week","This house was absolutely stunning in every way. The pictures do not do this place justice. From the moment we arrived, we felt right at home. Patrick did an amazing job remodeling this 100+ old house. The privacy of this 16-acre home is awesome. We came to ride the trails but found ourselves hanging out at the house more than we expected just because it was so nice, from coffee on the large porches in the morning and watching all the wildlife in the evening. We seen deer, ground hogs, chipmunks, lightning bugs, pigs, and the pesky raccoon all from the porch and through the large windows in the kitchen. If anyone has concerns about the house not having A/C, DON'T. We stayed during the week of Jully 4th, and it was always nice and cool in the house with the windows open. Patrick and David was very responsive with questions. We highly recommend this place to anyone and can not wait to come back. The only negative to this is place is you can't bring the fur babies, but is understandable."

The front and side porch was so nice that we took advantage of it on the rainy & sunny days playing games. We had a deer hop almost right to us. The kitchen had everything you needed, spices, coffee, in the pantry that held everything behind barn doors so there was no clutter in the main kitchen. I thought it was the best ideal I've ever seen.
It was a beautiful kitchen, nicely set up. The spa bath is luxurious. The area itself is beautiful. We went to Almost Heaven scenic view of Bluefield, breathtaking views. We also went to Brush creek falls, it was about a 1/2 mile walk on the trail. We will be back and will be staying at Patrick's again, only this time to purchase our own peice of heaven in our retirement coming soon. Thank you Patrick for your hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","This was a wonderful place to stay. 16 acres, mostly woods, with deer wandering through the property. The house was very, very nice. the only glitch we had was winter storm Elliott. We had temperatures and wind chills way below normal for this time of year which caused the cabin to only get to 50 degrees the first night. pipes froze up. the pellet stove had a hard time heating the place when it was below 20 degrees F. But the caretakers came right over and were very responsive in getting things back to normal. this place is a gem. and especially so I would think in the fall, spring, and summer. I will definitely consider this place again barring forecasts below 20 degrees."

Stayed a few nights","Do not hesitate to book your stay for this listing. This renovated 1920s farmhouse is absolutely stunning. Once you unpack, there is nothing that you will need. The solid oak floors throughout are beautiful. The kitchen is magnificent and you could have a party in the shower! The owners parents are close by to answer any questions that may arise and they are lovely people. If I could give this place 10 stars, I would, because it deserves it. One really lovely and unique feature is the wood pellet fireplace. When the temperature got cold, it really made it warm and cozy."

All the windows allow for beautiful views and plenty of light, while the location makes you feel ""secluded"". The kitchen, bathroom, and walk-in closet were fully stocked with everything we could have needed from cooking items to extra pillows to music, movies, and games. I had a question when I first arrived about operating the stove and Patrick quickly answered all my questions. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is amazing! It’s beautiful! The kitchen is perfect if you will be cooking meals while there with plenty of space to sit and eat inside or you can take it outside on the covered deck with a 6 person table. Our favorite part was the bathroom and tile shower, the pictures don’t do it justice! I loved the huge walk in closet in the master bedroom. It’s heated by a pellet stove which was more than enough to keep us comfortable and is so pretty! Above all else it was so clean which is always my first priority. Check in and check out was a breeze! It’s about 35 minutes from Winterplace which is why we were there. We really enjoyed our stay here and will hopefully be back!"

This place feels like a home, not a rental property that they threw the bare minimum furniture in to rent out. I felt very comfortable here and would absolutely stay again. The home is heated by a pellet stove which required me to keep the bedroom door open to get the heat in there in when I stayed during a freeze."

Stayed a few nights","High-end stay in the middle nowhere! Unexpected gem of a home conveniently close to Princeton and Winterplace Ski lodge. The home is beautiful inside and was well-stocked with plenty of towels, washer/dryer, laundry supplies, toiletries, etc. We baked macaroons and although we’d brought utensils from home, we could’ve gotten by with what was in the kitchen already. It IS true, however, that this place has no wifi (hence no Prime, Netflix, etc). Skiing at Winterplace is highly recommended for beginner to mid-level skiers!! 👍🏻"

The kitchen was designed beautifully and seemed brand-new. There were more than enough pots, utensils, glasses, dishes, and linens for the kitchen, bath and bedrooms. The wrap-around porch was shaded and cool even on warm August afternoons and evenings. The big patio table and chairs were perfect for eating outside or just hanging out together. There are lots of windows and we were comfortable even without air conditioning, especially with cooler nights. The house and landscaping were well maintained. Check in & out were easy."

The place was very accessible and close to everything we wanted to visit. Gas station isn't too far and neither is the pharmacy in case you need it. It is also spacious and has about everything that we needed. We specifically looked for a place that didn't have wi-fi because we wanted to disconnect from technology during our stay. Highly recommended!"

Stayed with kids","Patrick and his family were such gracious hosts. We ended up arriving at the same time as his dad was leaving so he gave us a whole guided tour of the home and told us about how he and Patrick did most of the renovations themselves. The house is BEAUTIFUL and has a kitchen I will be envious of for a long time. The big picturesque windows look out into the woods. Hopefully next time we will catch some of the wildlife! It was overall just so charming, cozy, comfortable, and just what our family needed. They even left a small vase of freshly cut flowers as a nice touch. We loved that it was close to our family in Bluefield and it was also a quick drive to the beautiful Pinnacle Rock State Park for a hike and the charming little town of Bramwell that we really enjoyed visiting during our stay. We also liked getting to play CDs (something we haven't done in a long time!) on the Bose stereo while we played games. We look forward to coming back to visit family and will absolutely stay here again! Thank you!"

Stayed about a week","If you are looking for a vacation rental that offers privacy, a natural setting, and a beautiful house - this is it! There is a deck with a dining patio set, as well as a front porch with comfy furniture. The house is beautifully decorated and has a number of unique features! There are enough dishes, pots, pans, silverware, and storage containers to meet all your needs. We visited a number of beautiful state parks (and saw numerous waterfalls) within a reasonable 90 minute drive or less. While this is a very ""country like"" setting, there is frequent traffic on the road the house is located on, and since there is no A/C, open windows allow the traffic noise to be heard. The only negatives are no wifi (as stated in the listing) and no cable tv. There were very few channels and they tended to freeze up and cut out. Neither of these items were enough to be considered problems - the positives FAR OUTWEIGH these things. We spend too much time online and watch too much TV at home anyway! We loved listening to music on the radio and there is a VAST collection of CD's that we really enjoyed! It really was a PERFECT place to celebrate our 42nd anniversary!"

Under the kitchen sink there were used toothbrushes and toothpaste, dirty rags and other household items. The kitchen sink there were used rags and filthy random items. Nothing clean in the kitchen. The walls and ceilings in each room were dirty. I had to clean the surface to just get somewhat relax. We all slept in our clothes and and took quick showers using paper towels to wash with. Last, there was a person on the property behind the house, in the parking lot who stayed in the running vehicle the entire time we were there!!! Horrific! This property deserves to be taken off the list. Not a home away from home!!!"

Stayed one night","For the price that they ask for a one night stay, I expected much better house. We would rather pay a person for the night stay as opposed to a hotel chain. The price they charge we could have stayed in a high end Hotel, over $200 for 1 night.
Very disappointed, would never go back."

He greeted us with a warm welcome and ensured us that if we needed anything, we could reach out to him. If I’m ever in the area again, I’d absolutely stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","I was extremely disappointed at how dirty and unsanitary this house was.  It honestly looked like it was being lived in right up until the moment I arrived. This was not spot clean dirty, this was all over filth. Stuff dripping down the walls, hair in the fridge, pee on the floor, food on the microwave, spills and food all over the kitchen, 2 inches of dust on the fan blades, dirty ""coffee station"", disgustingly dirty bath mat. I had to clean the toilet, where someone had obviously gotten sick on it, before I could even use it. I called the owner, they came right over and said they would send someone back to clean. I would imagine they were there for 5 minutes. Upon returning after they supposedly cleaned I contacted airbnb, who said they were sending someone again. I took and sent numerous pictures showing exactly what was needing attention and I could tell they had been there - but again, had only spot cleaned a few of the items I had mentioned - not even all of them. My son, his girlfriend and I then spent over an hour cleaning in order to make the house at least comfortable enough for me to stay in for the remainder of the week. The host then thought that reasonable compensation would be a half night's credit ($48) for all of this, after paying over $800.00 to stay in this disgusting mess I ended up having to clean myself. What a slap in the face - which tells me they honestly feel the condition of the house was okay, and most likely will not improve. I would definitely not recommend staying here until they have someone come in and thoroughly clean and sanitize the place. They also have a listing next door - not sure that it could be in any better condition, saw the same cleaner in and out over there."

The hosts were quick to respond with any communication we had, they were very gracious and friendly throughout our communications.
The location was easy to find and easily accessible. The neighborhood was very quiet at night.
Bottom line...we are happy that we chose this AirBnb and thankful to the hosts! We would rent again if in the area. Bluefield is in a beautiful setting with lots of friendly and genuine people!"

We ate there 2 times it was sooo good! They even might share a bit about the history of the building built in the late 1800's. We got a tour of all 7 floors of this old building!!

Group trip","Good stuff:
The ladies in our group liked the decor. There were six of us (none of us were married) and we felt a little cramped but four people would fit well in the space. One of the sofas is actually a futon which is a good sleep space. The hosts were very communicative and accommodated us which helped us out a lot.
Could be improved:
The kitchen was pretty bare - the refrigerator is a mini fridge and didn't have condiments. We were looking for a toaster but there wasn't one. Shampoo in the bathroom would have been a nice touch. The location was really great for visiting Bluefield College."

From the wrap around porch to the cozy fireplace, everything about this place exuded warmth and comfort. I particularly enjoyed watching the wildlife roam freely around the property, it truly felt like a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The beds were incredibly comfortable, with crisp clean sheets that made for a restful night's sleep. I also appreciated the peace of mind that came with knowing my privacy was being respected, despite the nearby neighbor who takes care of the property. There was plenty of parking available, and I never felt bothered during my stay, it was perfect. The water pressure was great and the water quality was good as well. My only regret is that this rental wasn't available for long term stay, as I would have loved to spend more time here."

We had plenty of room to park our trailer and sxs as well. It was also nice to be able to drive from the property straight to town and then to the hatfield Mccoy trails on our sxs. The house is spacious and very comfortable. As well as the large yard in front and back with plenty of deck space. Our 4-legged friends also enjoyed the spacious yards to roam and explore. The house is very well stocked and supplied with anything you would need. Roscoe is the neighbor at the entrance of the gravel road and he is super nice. He came over when i was tinkering with the sxs and introduced himself. He and i ended up talking for over an hour like old friends. He looks after the property and is extremely trust worthy. The wife and i will definitely stay at dirty girl lodge when we come back to ride the hatfield Mccoy trails again.

Additionally, the convenient location allowed us to easily explore the surrounding outdoor activities. The owner was incredibly helpful and accommodating, making our experience even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this place for pet-friendly and adventure-seeking guests!"

Stayed a few nights","We couldn’t get over the beautiful property and with several places to sit outside, you got to enjoy them all. The lightening bugs were so special and we didn’t want to end any night without seeing them. The kitchen is spacious and perfect for hanging out. The beds were super cozy which is really important. We were constantly surprised by the statue wolves that were in the house because they took some getting used to but made for many laughs, too. We will definitely make this sweet place our home away from home every time."

Stayed with a pet","We’ll definitely come back, and next time I’ll have my hiking boots.
We went to Bluefield to visit my husband’s family, and this was excellent for our needs. In the time we weren’t with my in-laws, we explored the forest behind the house. The plant life was breathtaking, and there were some interesting mushrooms up there. Wish we’d timed it to pick blackberries for a cobbler but they were just flowering at the end of May.
Everything worked fine within the house, and the kitchen was stocked to cook anything.
My husband once said that we don’t really have dew where we live and I wish I’d paid more attention to that, because dew in WV is like the morning after a deluge where I’m from. If you plan to be hiking around before noon, I highly recommend some water-resistant boots with good tread. You might think you just want to go for a quick walk up the path, but it’s too tempting to see what’s around the bend to have inadequate shoes."

Group trip","We stayed at Lisa's place for a family get together weekend, with guests from NY and SC. We found this home fabulous and it more than met our every need.
The location was terrific for ATV riding on the Hatfield/McCoy trails, and there is easy trailer parking in a lot just below the house - safe and secure.
The home is SO COMFORTABLE! Not so fancy that you don't dare actually live in the space, but not in the least shabby. It felt just like coming to mom's house! The kitchen and the kitchen table are huge - plenty big enough to feed a crowd. There's another big table on the back deck, as well. The entire house is VERY VERY well stocked, not just with the bare minimum, like some airbnb's. Just bring your food and ice and you'll be all set. Beds and all furniture are comfortable. Shower pressure is good and everything works just great. Communication with Lisa was wonderful, and they even stopped up and offered to give us some firewood for the fire ring! A+ AirBnB"

There is a full size washer/dryer set and a handy half bath on the first floor. It was not a problem for us but be aware all bedrooms are on the second floor (stairs).

Stayed with a pet","If you are on the fence about renting Lisa's place, go ahead and pull the trigger. This place is very nice with a very large yard to escape from the fast paced life. This house is placed on the property to where you get your privacy and far enough from the road that you can rest and nap with no noise. The house was very well equipped with anything you may need. Town is only around 2 miles away. We came for the Hatfield and McCoy Trails. The trailhead is approximately 6-8 miles away, we had no issues riding the asphalt to get where we wanted to go but if long distance on the pavement is something you don't want to do, you may want to find somewhere a little closer. If riding a little distance on the asphalt doesn't bother you then this place is for you! We loved Lisa's place and will for sure be staying again. Thank you Lisa!"

Watching the sunset, drink in hand, around the firepit while the guys played cornhole... it doesn't get much better than that!
Literally all we needed was food & drinks because the house was fully stocked with everything else we needed for a 4 night stay!
Communication was excellent, Lisa answered almost immediately when I had some questions before & during the stay. Places like these I call 'true gems'............."

Stayed a few nights","What a treat! The home was a real gem for us to find. My family and I come to West Virginia each year to ride the Hatfield McCoy trails and this was the first time we tried to stay somewhere new. Needless to say, we will be looking to stay at Lisa’s property in the future. Check-in and check-out was flawless and the home was very well stocked and clean throughout. The property around the house was very pretty and you are far enough off of the road that there is no road noise. Everything in Lisa’s description was as we found it. Only suggestion I’d make is this - Don’t let your man child, step father play with the simply safe alarm. He will without a doubt set it off and it makes a very embarrassing phone call to the host to shut off.
I try not to only list positives, on the rare occasion that I do leave a review. I must admit it was tough finding a negative for this property. If I had to list something, I’d say just know there is no central AC in the house. We visited in July and it was in the mid 90s outside, so it was very toasty in the house upon our arrival. The fans and window AC units help for sure, but it does take some time to cool. Food for thought.
Overall I can’t say enough good things about our stay. I look forward to returning."

Stayed with kids","Overall, our family felt that the house was a pretty good value. Lisa easy to work with and did a nice job with communication. The house was spacious and had most of what we needed. Finding the house and gaining access was a breeze. I would say that the house could use a little bit of maintenance and/or upgrades here and there, but nothing major. Examples would include the very loud exhaust fan in half bath, the exposed wires over the kitchen sink, and the fact that the upstairs bathrooms lacked towel bars and/or hooks. Also, families with smaller kids might be concerned that the lower half of the staircase does not have a railing or bannister. Stand-out positive features included the big wrap-around porch (loved it) and the huge dining table. Also, the beds were comfortable and the WiFi met our needs without any issues."

The host was very helpful with any questions we had and the setting was relaxing. We were arriving late and she had a neighbor turn lights on so we could find it easier. We can't wait to return. Hight recommend.

We highly recommend a drive to Whitesville to view the memorial to miners who lost their lives in the 2010 disaster. Beckley Exhibition mine and Tamarack are great places to enjoy in the area. Beautiful drive to Grandview - New River Gorge National Park for a picnic. We also enjoyed the Sandstone Falls and deer feeding under the boardwalk. Lost World Caverns in Lewisburg is worth the drive!"

Stayed about a week","This is a great place to relax and enjoy the benefits of a large piece of land with fields and forests that our dogs enjoyed exploring for hours. It was very clean inside with plenty of amenities for cooking, grilling, and entertainment (games, TV, music). I would characterize the inside as relaxed and homey, with comfortable sofas and chairs, woven rugs, ceiling fans, and nature photos. The bath towels were plush and the king bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed sitting on the back deck looking at fireflies over the fields in the evening and having breakfast and dinner on the front porch. The location is good for visiting beautiful sites of southern West Virginia, including New River Gorge (and other associated National Parks) and Pipestem Resort and State Park on the Bluestone River. The local Bluefield City Park also has a nice trail network, and nearby Cabin Creek State Park has some waterfalls and trails to see. As one of the highest elevation cities east of the Rockies, Bluefield is known as ""Natures Air-Conditioned City"", and we observed that daytime temps in July were 8-10 degrees cooler than back home in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, which was great for spending time outdoors. The main road is pretty busy at times but the house is back far enough (several hundred feet) that there was no issue with the dogs getting anywhere near it. Lisa is very responsive to any queries and was a pleasure to interact with."

Her hospitality is what is right with the world. I took my dad on a trip (back to his dad’s Virginia roots) for his 70th, and Lisa’s home made a perfect getaway.

The bedrooms were so well cleaned and nice i mean nice linen. I couldn’t understand why the beds were so nice when the guys were probably gonna be dirty that got into them. Sam was so nice we had one little hiccup and he showed up to make sure nothing else went wrong. This man was so nice he is a saint. I will be definitely staying with him again And I think we just became regulars with him because of his over the top service. He went over and beyond his way to make sure we were all happy comfortable and the accommodations were right. Love this place and Sam. There is a gorgeous mountain behind you with a great view of the fog moving off the mountains in the morning. I do did not want to leave. Until next time… with love the Schisler clan.

Parking is a little tight if you have a few trucks. We rented A and B and had two full sized trucks and two 22’ trailers and made it work. We would stay again! Sam was on site when we arrived and told us how to get to a few places nearby and showed us around the apartments. Tim was very quick with replies and checked in on us. It was wonderful to have such great hosts!! Thank you for the wonderful stay!! Can’t wait to visit again!

The highway is busy, and you're on a slight curve in the road, so it does come up fast when you're trying to find it. Everything was nice and clean, and the beds are super comfy! Sam and his brother Tim were very responsive and took care of things right away! We had a smoke detector that needed a battery replaced, and they were on it in no time! Definitely a nice place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Our stay at Pinnacle Place ATV Lodge was absolutely amazing & surpassed our expectations!!!
The hosts were friendly & quick to respond to questions. They personally made sure we had everything that we needed & some! The place was so clean & smelled great!! Which is big for me!
There were laminated maps & a time table showing how far between the trail systems- which was so helpful. You could tell that they definitely took thought into stocking the home- Dawn Platinum dish soap (my fav- truly helps out in the kitchen), every kitchen appliance we could have possibly needed, first aid kit (luckily we never needed), even some Tide Pods out for our use. And more.
The beds & linens were SO comfortable! Which has been a hit or miss at other places. We slept great after a long day of riding.
The location was convenient & close to trails & the parking was great too.
The pics didn’t do justice!
We will most certainly lodge with them again & again! Already booking our next trip!"

I can say this is one of those rare occasions you get exactly what you see and then some. You really can't ask for much more. We will definitely look to stay here in the future."

I couldn't complain; we wanted them with us.
Our unit A was spacious, clean and we weren't bothered by noise, from people in other units.
They also have spacious parking for families with ATV'S, trailers and trucks.
Our unit A had 2 nicely decorated bedrooms.
The beds were so comfortable. Check out this place... especially UNIT A

Tim stopped personally and introduced himself and gave us the backstory on the place. That stood out to us because I have never had the owner personally stop by to ask how was our stay. I would recommend staying with them!

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our
Stay at Pinnacle Place. It was exactly as described. Clean, fully stocked kitchen, lots of linens, and comfy beds! The hosts were great
Communicators and even helped us find a repair shop when we had an issue on the trails. The parking is what we especially liked. We have a 7500 truck and a 24 foot enclosed trailer and lots of times hosts say “plenty of parking”… but we fit perfect here, with room to spare. They’re working on improvements at the fire pit area and they even have a water hose to rinse your units off.
I did let the hosts know a little challenge with the maps.. just be sure you use the right zip code.. our apple wanted to send us to Iager not Bluefield, we were able to catch the error because we frequent this area. It’s also just before Pinnacle Rock state park, it stands alone, it’s not a home surrounded by others. Your map may say you are there, shy of the correct location. We will definitely be back! Thank you!!"

Stayed with a pet","Clean place in a good area with plenty of parking. My family and I travelled to WV to ride the Hatfield and McCoy Trails. The house is in a good location for the Pocahontas Trails. A little bit of a drive to the other trails but overall wasn’t too bad. There were a few restaurants in the area as well as a grocery store. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for plenty of parking for trucks and trailers. Another thing that I liked was the area to wash off the machines at the end of the day. Overall, the place was everything we were looking for!"

We enjoyed getting to meet them and hear about the history of the property as well as their future plans for it. The property is close to town and trails and there was a great amount of parking for both units which isn’t something you always find at every property around the trails. We appreciated their attention to detail and all the small personal touches. By the end of the weekend we were already making plans to come back next month and stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Wow! I’ll try to keep this short but what a GREAT place to stay! We have been to Hatfield McCoy system multiple times over the years and this was by far the best place we have stayed! Close to amenities, super clean and homey, great layout, easy parking for trailers, relaxing area, trail access just down the road, I could go on! I loved that they had camera systems all over the outside- we never had to worry about our SxS’s or truck there. And they actually had hooks and shelves to put your things on (something most air bnbs seem to lack), their bath towels are super cozy, and the furniture wasn’t cheap yard sale finds. Sam & Tim were AMAZING hosts! Prompt responses, offered recommendations, helped answer our questions and checked in with us to make sure everything was going well. 1000% recommend staying here!!"

Stayed a few nights","We chose this place for the located and proximity to our friends. Overall the place was good for what we used crashing after a long days ride. Sleeping will be better challenge if you need silence, but the window mount style air/ heat unit is installed in the wall above the bed. Not the best location for a quiet night of rest. A plus would have been a love seat to chill on, but due to size this isn’t doable. You only have a dinning table and two chairs that sit underneath the tv in the opposite corner of the room. The river is across the street, you’ll have to go across the street and down the hill to enjoy the view. Major plus was it had really good hot water."

Extremely close to the trails, great outdoor area to sit and swing and have a fire. My husband enjoyed hanging around with the guys for a while. They were very helpful with restaurant suggestions and they gave us directions to a second rental they have where they have a power washer we utilized prior to loading the utv and heading home. Definitely would stay here again. My only suggestion would be a second towel bar in the bathroom and a griddle, George Foreman or hot plate type of item in the kitchen."

This was our second time staying here. We only need to bring our suitcase, food/beverage and our ride. This past visit I discovered Door Dash services were available, so one evening we used the service. Nice view of Bluestone River across the road. End your day by sitting on one of the porch swings surrounding the fire pit and sipping your favorite beverage while enjoying the company of others. Or relax inside watching a movie or two before catching some sleep on one of the most comfortable bed I for one have ever slept on. We plan on staying here again and again."

The Airbnb is technically detached from their house which makes it even more private!!

The view on the mountains was very impressive and the hummock on the wonderful terrace was snug and comfy. But: the cabin was not very clean and we heard some kind of rodent was active during the night in the house. We didn´t have a 4wheel drive - which was a problem since we really had difficulties going up the deep gravel road up the house. Corby was at all times very helpful in answering our questions and gave uns some ideas about what to do since we did not really find hiking trails directly from the cabin and always had to drive quite far to do some things. For all who search for tranquility and an interesting and spacious cabin it will be perfect."

Stayed a few nights","To book here I would suggest only a 4 wheel drive, and to have at least 1 very capable outdoorsy person on the trip.
The cabin is very isolated, we didn't see a single person during the whole 3 days we were there. We hiked part of the the trail by the house but the hills were so steep we were out of breath after about 10 mins and headed back.
The nearby town is at the bottom of the mountain, which is great, but wow the drive up/down the gravel roads is intense! They are narrow and often very steep. If you combine it with snow, you could really struggle to get to and from the cabin.
It snowed the last night we were there, and we lost power for 3-4 hours which was scary. Luckily power was restored quickly.
It took us over 30 minutes to pull out of the driveway due to the snow and loose gravel (we had a 2WD compact SUV). For a while I thought we would be stranded there until the snow cleared but we managed to make it out.
Would recommend for outdoor people who want isolation."

The cabin was well stocked (food, games, linen, washing detergent, cleaning supplies) so I did not need to go to Walmart much but the tip was well appreciated. Corbyn responded to my questions quickly. I got to make smores and enjoy the wildlife. The space was amzing and the master bed was so comfortable, I did not want to leave. The security system made me feel safe and I would without a doubt book this place again."

Stayed with kids","The cabin was beautiful, peaceful, spacious and a perfect getaway for a couple or a family.. We hiked the property, had snow ball fights, roasted marshmallows and enjoyed the company of one another.
The cabin had everything we needed and what we didn’t bring, we picked up at Walmart and Lowe’s, which was 20 minutes away. Pick up a few bundles of firewood while you’re there.
We definitely needed a good sturdy vehicle to get up the mountain with the snow and ice. The best suggestion I can give is to take the direction that Corbyn provides and pre-drop a pin to the location.. the roads aren’t well marked and the gps won’t take you there based on the address and try and get there before dark. It can be a booger at night to find..
Definitely recommend this one for any occasion. It’s almost perfect and we hated to leave."

The star gazing was excellent, we saw the milky way, shooting stars, and satellites each night just sitting on the deck. The kitchen and living space was very comfortable and having a wood fire going in the fireplace when the air is crisp outside provides an amazing experience.
There are hiking trails around the property along with just walking up the roads throughout the community provide for the opportunity to be more in nature but not far from the cabin. You are not around any other cabins and we did not see another person during our stay which was exactly what we wanted."

It’s a solid 15 minutes to drive up to the cabin, but after the first time it was easy to navigate. We really enjoyed the ride up and down the mountain, it was like an adventure! You just don’t want to have to go up and down more than once a day, so get everything you need at Sam’s Club or Walmart. We loved the deck overlooking the mountains. The house was set up nicely with a master bed and bath upstairs and 2 bedrooms downstairs. The property was amazing, with endless trails for hiking. We brought our dirt bike and quad and rode the trails on the property. We spent one day at Hatfield & McCoy but the trails on the property were really great. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come back in the Spring!"

Be aware that if there has been a high amount of precipitation it may be difficult making the very end of the drive, but we did it in several sedan's and nobody got irrecoverably stuck. Corbyn got back to us quickly even though he was getting hit by a hurricane, so I can only imagine he is great when times are good."

Group trip","What a great place to stay. Corbyn is a great host and super responsive. The house is in a serene location. It’s definitely 20 minutes to the store. The roads aren’t bad. We were there before Memorial Day weekend and the road was easy to travel. It’s wide enough that passing vehicles going the other way was not daunting.
We saw tons of birds, deer, wild turkeys, and chipmunks. My older sons hiked for an hour or more on the property and loved it.
The 3 stars for cleanliness are some things that can be easily fixed and I think the host will get fixed.
I would recommend this location to stay at again. I would stay here again. My kids (all young adults 18-25) want to go back with ATVs.

Corbyn is super efficient with communications and his tips were so helpful! Quick side note: We followed his suggestion and hiked Cascade Falls at Jefferson National Park. It was awesome!!! After the hike we went to a great Mexican Restaurant (Riviera) right near the trail.
Final note on the cabin, is that it is very clean and the ultimate escape for the hustle and bustle!"

Group trip","Adventurer's Paradise was a great get-a-way for our party of 6...!! This being our 1st time there, we didn't realize there was such a long stone road to get out in the wilderness. It was a very picturesque drive by the directions we received from Corbyn and very ""spot on"" to get from Walmart Supercenter to the cabin from the northside. On the road from the cabin to the south was also very scenic with a creek running along the road. We came to the area to ride motorcycles, 3 HD trikes & 1 CanAm Spyder. We trailered our CanAm to the cabin and actually made it down the driveway when arriving and loaded it back on the trailer and drove back up the driveway when leaving. We made the drive with a Chev Equinox AWD. Because of the loose stones there had to be 2 up on the CanAm to get up the drive, the trikes made it OK because of limited slip differentials. We had a great time with rain only 3 times but was short lived, not all day. The cabin had plenty of space for the 6 of us, ate outside most of the time because of the nice weather. Did have trouble deciding where to go because of so many places to choose from. Of course we did ride the ""Back of the Dragon"", that was the main reason for picking the cabin there. Every day was a new route to take, including the ""Blue Ridge Parkway"" and a new place to eat including the ""Wooden Pickle"" and the ""Hungry Brother BBQ"". On 1 of our rides we stopped in the town of ""War"" and got ice cream, order a cone and get 2 scoops, order it by the cup and get several more scoops for the same price..! All in All, we loved the cabin, loved the wildlife, and loved the area for riding...!!! Wildlife we saw included, not just at the cabin, Mama bear & cubs, Deer, Racoons, Fox, and Wild Turkeys. Thanks Corbyn for sharing your property with us...!!!"

Beds were super comfortable, very spacious and clean. We had a black bear visitor our first night. We went to the Hatfield McCoy trails our first two days - Pocahontas trail head is about 30 minutes and the Warrior trail head was about an hour and a half away."

We had an incredibly comfortable stay and loved every minute of board games and basking on the deck. Whether you're a nature lover or just want to escape the bustle for a while, you'll love this place.
And a tip - download some movies from Netflix onto your laptop and hook it up to the huge TV via hdmi to avoid overwhelming the wifi or your mobile Hotspot."

Stayed a few nights","This cabin is a true wonder and gem. It is ideal for anyone looking to enjoy the solitude and wonder of the mountains surrounding the cabin. The cabin provides full amenities to make your stay stressless. The rooms are spacious and clean. The outside deck affords a million dollar view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The night sky is a wonder of sunset beauty and crystal clear views of the stars.
The hiking and ATV trails are not for the novice hiker/ATVer. They are extremely steep and for you hikers, require you be in fairly good physical shape. Lotito City Park is just a quick drive away for those hikers who desire an easier hike.
This is the place to go if you want to be someplace that is stunningly beautiful and never see or hear another human being."

Stayed about a week","The house, deck, and property are stunning! Yet, it could be much better - less clutter (which would also mean less dust), a bit more furnishings such as a lounge and a clean hammock on the deck, and a better organized house (for example too many left-over condiments in the fridge, shop vac in bedroom closet) would make this an exceptional Airbnb. Anyone who plans on working remotely needs to be aware of the poor Wifi (understand that it's no fault of the owner that no better options are available in the area). I tried numerous times but was unable to log into my company's VPN, it kept timing out. Corbyn kindly bought additional gigs but it's a matter of high-speed not gigs. Thought it's worth mentioning as nowadays many people work remotely and might combine time off with working a few days like we had planned. You’re also not able to use any of the streaming services, which didn’t matter to us but might to some guests. The remoteness of the house and somewhat long, narrow, and curvy drive to the house aren't conducive to finding a coffee shop or library to do work so we had to leave early, which in a way was okay as we didn't feel 100% comfortable there anyway."

I came to the area to ride the Hatfield McCoy Trails and pulled a 16’ utility trailer up the mountain and right to the cabin with out any issue. For those that worry about mountain driving; yes they’re dirt roads, but they are better maintained than many of the blacktop county roads that I have been on. Corbyn was quick to respond to any questions and there is no shortage of fun things to do and explore on the mountain. I recommend visiting the waterfall that is on the community property."

Corbyn has everything there that you need while keeping things a bit rustic—if you want a fire, better get chopping! Nice hikes and a big trail system on the property with a stream running through it. We had snow, so great sledding hills for the kids. This is the mountains, so bring DVDs, the sound system and TV are great, but the internet is a mountain slow. Corbyn was very responsive and helpful, couldn’t ask for more in the service side of things."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely place and it's just as advertised. The view of the valley from the deck and from windows across most of the front of the house is the big selling point, but there are a lot of great things about this cabin. The living space is very comfortable, the kitchen is well appointed, and there's a ton of light. Outdoor space is great, and there's an area under the deck where we could store our mountain bikes out of the weather. Nice fireplace, as well, and plenty of wood (and we left a bit more than we found). We don't usually watch tv on vacation, but there's a huge tv over the fireplace and plenty of channels to pick from, along with a fancy sound system hooked to Alexa. Internet was adequate, and we ""worked from home"" using the wifi and supplementing with our phones (stong cell service allowed for Zoom calls, no problem). We saw wild turkeys and deer right from the cabin, and enjoyed the trails, too (although a bit steep in places for mountain bikes, at least at our skill level). There's an interesting hike/mountain bike ride on the gravel road that goes up along the ridge (I think this is the tail end of state route 662). It's fairly level after the initial climb from the cabin, is car-accessible but really lightly traveled. And no issues for us getting down/up the gravel driveway (although I'm sure it'd be interesting in snow, but could walk the last 100 yards if needed, as is noted elsewhere). The owner also has a lot of great local tips! We hiked the AT out of Little Wolf Creek Primitive Management Area, about 45 minutes drive, well worth it. And we found most anything we needed in Bluefield WV. Overall this is a great property, with a lot to do and see, super comfortable space, and a lot of small touches that are very well thought out (sound system, kitchen gadgets, indoor and outdoor fireplaces, etc.) We highly recommend!"

The furniture, especially the beds, were super comfortable and the whole interior was very homey. Excellent hikes close to the cabin as well, I would recommend checking out the “Trail Boss” loop, an offshoot of the AT, which is about 30 minutes away.
FYI- there is satellite television with every channel imaginable, but due to the location, WiFi was a bit spotty and not strong enough for streaming movies, shows, or sports; that being said, we had great cell service at the cabin so we were able to stream via our mobile hot spot without difficulty."

The cabin is well-appointed with anything you could need in the kitchen. Corbyn communicated very promptly and helpfully; follow his careful instructions to reach the cabin and you'll have 0 trouble up the mountain. We did it easily (in clear summer weather) with four people in a Honda Fit, including driving up and down the driveway multiple times. We had some fun animal sightings from the awesome deck, including a wild turkey and an extremely curious little black bear that visited us multiple times the first evening--it seemed it was expecting to find something tasty, so make sure never to leave trash or food around outside."

Group trip","We stayed at Corbyn's Cabin for about 9 days at the end of July 2020. The place is beautiful and very welcoming. It is furnished with style, has TVs in almost every room, is comfortable, and well stocked with appliances and cooking implements. We even found lots of food and condiments in the cabinets and fridge. The deck is private, has a nice view and is perfect for relaxing in the sun and/or reading a book. While we were there we saw plenty of wildlife (deer, wild turkeys...) and we were visited multiple times by a mid-size bear who seems to routinely walk by the cabin at or right after sunset. Once he stole our garbage and disseminated it in the woods which was fun to catch on camera but not so fun afterwards when we had to pick it all up. The only down side of the cabin is its location: it is very remote and isolated. It takes a good 15+ minutes on a dirt road to get up or down and, especially after the recent heavy rains, the dirt road had washed out, had deep ruts and had become hard to negotiate for a regular car. However, if my lousy Chrysler minivan managed to do it, your car can probably do it too with a bit of skill.
Overall we had a really good time at the cabin and we recommend it to all who want a peaceful and relaxing time."

The fire wood for the fire place was already cut and ready for us. The kids room was stocked with games, a tv and a bean bag so even on the rainy days we had plenty to keep us busy. We enjoyed walks on the trails that were located on the property. We drove a little down the road and fished and waded in the creek. The boys loved it. Corbyn had fishing poles, tackle box and nets for us to use so next time we will leave ours at home. The house felt very safe as it was away from everything and had an alarm system that we were able to use. The house was clean and well maintained. We will be back to stay here again soon!"

Stayed a few nights","My trip at Corbyns cabin was amazing. First the mountain drive up was a lot less intimidating than the directions and reviews made it out to be. Yes it’s mountain driving on a gravel road but that’s it. Also the driveway is a bit steep and also gravel so some vehicles may have difficulty with it but parking at the top is only about a 500ft walk to the cabin so it’s not terrible of a walk if you decide it’s to steep.
Now on to the good stuff. This cabin was immaculate when it comes to cleanliness which is always important to me.
It is secluded to where you don’t see any neighbors and you don’t hear a sound from other cabins or town. You truly are in a mountain escape. Most cabins I have rented were on cliff edges and in a row of cabins with your neighbor being 10 feet away so having a secluded 18 acre lot was amazing. Now as for the view again to get this type of view you typically have to be on a cliff side somewhere with a steep drop off which isn’t safe for smaller children. Not at this cabin. Here there is a nice acre at least of cleared area where kids can run, play, and explore and older kids could even be trusted to go down the trails to the creek and play. It’s also perfect for a well trained off leash pup to get to be a dog in the wild. My pup a golden retriever has never had the ability to safely wonder away from me but here she did great and was able to explore a little.
The kitchen was also stocked with anything and everything I could think of using (pots, pans, utensils, spices, oil, common condiments, and a few foods the prior guests left behind) I would beware of expiration dates but I just threw out what wasn’t in date anymore. I was a little surprised that it didn’t have a dishwasher though. However, even though I hate washing my own dishes it wasn’t enough to deter me from loving this cabin.
The master king size bed was sooooo comfortable and seemed to be a sleep number of sorts where you could pick the softness or firmness of the mattress which was a good surprise. I slept so soundly the first evening. Also the garden tub in the master bath was nice to relax in after a day of hiking the trails.
I would gladly rent this cabin again and in fact am currently considering returning in July with my parents and brothers children to allow my brother and his wife a get away without the kiddos."

Everything we needed was provided, right down to the firewood. There were five of us and the cabin accommodated us just fine. We went up there to ride the Hatfield McCoy trails. It was a quick trip back down the mountain and then about 20 min to get to trailhead. Pretty convenient and there is a Walmart, McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Subway..etc right there when you get down the mountain if you need anything.

There are very precise. Corbyn also checked up on us even when we didn’t needed him. The cabin is secluded, the nearest neighbor is pretty far way.

Cleanliness was also high on our list. Corbyn's place looked perfect but it's hard to tell in pictures what you're actually getting. I read every review and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did!
The location is perfect, away from everything but not too far if you really need to get to a store, restaurant, etc. We followed Corbyn's directions and had no trouble finding the cabin.
The cabin was very clean and well-stocked. Everything you would need plus things you didn't think of. I like the open layout of the kitchen and living room. It's very cozy but plenty of room for our family to spread out. We enjoyed relaxing around the fireplace and the views of the mountains are stunning.
Corbyn is a great host. Fast communication and very helpful.
Sadly, we had to leave the cabin two days early due to a family emergency but we plan to come back in the future. Perfect spot for our family!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is clean and we'll kept. There is cell phone reception up there. I love how secluded this cabin is, though it's a little difficult to get to. Corbyn was there for anything I needed."

Stayed a few nights","Terrific location with great amenities. We arrived up the easy side. Being from New England, the terrain to the cabin was somewhat unexpected, but not an impact on considering a stay again."

Stayed a few nights",The views was Breathtaking. Saw lots of wildlife even a Bear on our last day. Loved it! The only bad thing was we got hot in the day and could not adjust the air conditioner. The owner controls it remotely. But everything else was 1st. class. Definitely stay here again.

Stayed with kids","We had a really great time at Corbyn’s place. We were able to drive to some great trails in and around Bluefield. We loved the a Cascades, Brush Falls, and the Devils Bathtub the best. We found some fun attractions at pipestem that our whole family enjoyed. Really pretty views and such a relaxed place to vacation."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, great cabin and great host. We had an amazing time. The view from the porch is even more spectacular in real life than on the pictures. We enjoyed all our meals outside surrounded by trees. Corbyn showed us the hidden treasures like the creek, the waterfall and some lookout points and helped us explore the trails around the house. He was so attentive to our special needs (we brought a six year old with us and our ATVs).
The cabin offers everything you might need. We enjoyed playing games on the big comfy couch and cooking dinner in the well equipped kitchen after a long day of hiking and riding in the nature.
We can totally recommend staying at the cabin...if you are a nature lover you won’t be disappointed. If you are not you will most definitely become one after this.
Thank you Corbyn for sharing your love for this area with us. We will be back soon."

Stayed with kids",Corbyn's place is very welcoming. It is clean and comfortable. You feel right at home. Check-in and out is very easy. The beds and sleeping arrangements were very comfortable. Corbyn answered any questions we had and got back to me very quickly. My family of seven stayed for four days and were very pleased. We had everything we needed. A few minutes down the mountain there are plenty of places to eat and enjoy. The views are spectacular from the porch and the weather was beautiful for our stay in July! Thank you for having us and we look forward to staying again in the future!

Stayed about a week",We stayed 8 days at this amazing cabin. Leaving was the worst part of the trip!! We actually wanted to stay an extra night and Corbyn was quick to accommodate us. The private location makes it the perfect get away!! It's great for an outdoorsmen or a romantic vacation. Corbyn has a list of beautiful places to check out that can easily take up a whole trip so no need to stress on pre planning activites!! We plan on returning asap!!
