Stayed a few nights","the pool was full of algae, bugs, and dirt. tried to clean it of and couldn’t. there was stain on everything outside and i cousins even sit down. the house smelled, the crosley and blinds were broke. the shower head was dirty and rusted. the hosts failed to respond to me when i sent them the pictures of the upsetting circumstances and tried to claim that i was lying even though i had pictures"

Stayed a few nights","Completely worth it for the comfortable REAL beds, linens, blankets and pillows. Hands down the most comfortable beds - BOTH - I've come across using Air BnBs in over 5 years.
Location is great, had no idea that Gallo Blanco was open again which I hadn't dined at since they were at the Clarendon - so that was a great surprise and within walking distance. Amazing how the neighborhood has evolved over the past 20 years - for the better.
Private driveway parking was nice. The kitchen has everything, if I needed an extended stay, I wouldn't hesitate to book this place for a week as the kitchen will have everything you'll need, lots of condiments, spices, odds and ends too.
The air conditioning was ice cold and the ceiling fans were powerful, you NEED this during Phoenix summers. Any complaints I might have had are simply nit pics and not worth posting compared to the overall quality I experienced."

Stayed with a pet","The location, house and decor were lovely and what we needed. My complaints are that the outside gate doesn’t stay latched/closed (no communication about this) so my dog got out and we had a very stressful moment, luckily she came right back. Also the pool was really dirty so I only felt comfortable sticking my feet in. Not a fault of the owners, but the neighbors had a crazy loud party until 2 am (we even called the cops) so we got no sleep on our last night. Was disappointed that I got no response from the host when I messaged them these issues."

Stayed with kids","Great location! Comfy beds and felt very cozy. We are not to picky but the bathroom drain needs to be fixed. Every time we took a bath the water would not drain fast, causing it to have about 4in of water in the tub. Also, we were going to use the extra comforters but they were dirty, luckily the ones already on the bed weren’t . Overall we saw past that and enjoyed our stay."

Our kids loved the games and we loved relaxing in the backyard. There were a few things needing maintenance around the house, but the hosts were super kind. They responded right away when we had an issue and were willing to help. We also appreciated the recommendations for places to visit in the area."

Stayed a few nights","The house was in a great location. Only 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix, 20 minutes to Scottsdale, and 20 minutes to Tempe. It was nice staying in a home just a bit outside of the city so not to deal with any city traffic. The first thing we noticed when walking in were all the details. We loved the aesthetic of the cactus house and all the decor inside. We especially loved the biñho board and it was our first time playing this game. We had so much fun playing once we got home we had to order our own. If I ever visit Phoenix again I would definitely stay at Dan and Fran’s. Not to mention all their dog friendly additives like the treats, bowls, and poop bags. Made us wish we brought our dogs."

little spot for us to stay while we had an early Thanksgiving celebration.

It was a good value for the price and I would stay there again."

Phoenix would not be a choice destination for us, we were there for a business conference, but being able to come home to my dogs was everything!

Stayed with kids","October 2023
We really enjoyed our stay at the Cactus Cottage... The kitchen was pretty well stocked with basic items such as seasonings, oil, pots, pans, and utensils. The beds were comfortable. However, the pillows could have been a little bit more firm. The temperature in the home maintained a comfortable temperature. there were a couple of cobwebs we cleaned by the table in the kitchen, but maybe it was there for 🎃 vibes. Our grandson really enjoyed the tank pool. The neighborhood was walkable. We walked to the Welcome Diner for breakfast and walked over to Xanadu for coffee.. We even ventured over to Roosevelt Row... And even met a neighbor near to the property..."

Stayed with a pet","I used this Air BnB as a landing spot - so wasn't here much. The place was lovely, I'm not sure as a single woman that I would have walked around at night - and there was some noise from the city that is clearly included in the description - but the space was comfy. I felt safe. I was sorry it wasn't warm enough to go in the pool. The kitchen had everything that I needed. It might be noted that the washer and dryer are outside - under cover and worked fine. Dan and Fran were super responsive and went out of their way to be helpful I see why they are ""super hosts""."

Stayed a few nights",The stay at Dan and Frans went well until our last night when we went to enter the home and the door keypad had lost power and wouldn’t unlock. I had tried contacting Dan and Fran that night but it was late and ultimately we had to get a hotel room for the night. In the morning we eventually made it into the Airbnb after some minor miscommunication with the lock box codes. That morning we checked out and I got an apology from Dan and Fran. They offered to compensate for the last night but I asked for them to compensate for the hotel room instead and I would just pay the total rental charge amount. They refused and only offered me compensation for the one night stay and some of the cleaning fee. The place was nice but after this I’d recommend staying elsewhere to avoid any inconvenience.

Was told by a few Uber drivers to be aware of our surroundings in the area but we never felt unsafe (though we didn’t walk around at night).

We loved that the house was walking distance to the new restaurant we saw featured on Netflix, called Tratto. We had a fabulous meal and came back to the cottage and plaid the cactus themed card game which rounded out our perfect stay. The back patio was lovely too, we will be back again. Thanks Fran and Dan!"

Stayed a few nights","I have to be honest because I would love to know things before I stay somewhere. The place was very nice and clean. Dan was great with communicating and coming to the house to try and make things right. That being said my stay was not comfortable at all. I checked out a day before my checkout date because we weee so uncomfortable. First thing, my husband and I got bit up my mosquitoes, we killed like 4 of them. We did bring this issue up with Dan and he said the house hasn’t had any issues with them and Phoenix was prone to mosquitoes. I am in Town for business at least 2 weeks out of the month and never had any issues with mosquitoes. We just dealt with them. Second thing was the shower. The water does not get hot in the shower at all! You will get barely warm at best. All sinks get super hot. This was a deal breaker for me. I did message Dan and he came over and turned up the water heater, but when we showered that night it was literally no difference. I ended up sick taking cold showers. The night before we left I boiled hot water and took a bath just to get some kind of warmth. I felt like this was not real, but it was happening because I had no choice. I tried to thug it out, and I did for the most part but we just couldn’t take it anymore. If you are ok with cold showers and barely warm showers this place is perfect! No other complaints at all. Beautiful place, but was just so uncomfortable."

The place was not ready for us by the time we checked in. We came back again after leaving our bags at the Airbnb.
Also the listing is misguiding. It says 6 guests, 3 beds but, there were two beds and a blow up mattress. The space is small to blow up the mattress and use it. We felt a bit misguided by the listing because the blow up mattress was not mentioned."

I thought the pool was going to be really small but it was actually very roomy and perfect for us to hang in and enjoy a nightcap.

My sister and her husband had one bedroom & bath, my wife & I took the other. We're all kind of fussy & picky people. But we were stoked! We had our own private spaces plus a roomy common space to share. Well-stocked kitchen, private tiny yard with a fruiting lemon tree, silent neighborhood, walked to the grocery store, to a gorgeous park surrounding the Heard Museum, to the Vietnamese restaurant across the street from the Thai restaurant. We even liked the crazy cat guy down the street: cats looked healthy, and he was pleasant to us. Highest possible recommendation."

The space was trendy and well-furnished, albeit a bit smaller than anticipated. While the neighborhood was peaceful, the surrounding scenery wasn't particularly remarkable. A notable issue we encountered was the presence of dog hair throughout the accommodation. Unfortunately, my wife is allergic to dog hair, and this significantly impacted her comfort and health during our stay. Despite our efforts to clean up, she was unwell for most of our visit. Additionally, having only one TV for all guests proved to be a bit inconvenient. In our experience with short-term rentals, multiple TVs are standard, and it would be a beneficial upgrade for future guests. We suggest that the owners consider addressing these points to enhance the experience for subsequent visitors."

The difference is instead of one hotel room you get a spacious two bedrooms, 2 full baths, living room, kitchen with large kitchen bar work space & thoughtful designer decor. You will feel good immediately upon entering."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa and Wayne’s place was very cute and a perfect location. The neighborhood was cute and we felt safe during our stay. The beds were comfortable. The Nespresso machine was a great touch. The bathrooms had soap, shampoo and conditioner as well as a small hair dryer. The only thing we didn’t care for was the shower design with only half glass. It looks cool, but no matter how careful you are water gets on the floor. Also, because the house is older and has beautiful wood flooring it creaks when you walk, only an issue if you are a light sleeper and someone else gets up. Otherwise great stay. During our stay the smoke detector started chirping due to a low battery in the morning. Lisa and Wayne were very fast to fix the issue and respond. It was fixed by the time we returned after our outing. Great stay."

It happened to be within walking distance of at least 4 vegan/vegetarian eateries, which was a major plus for me! It was very clean and appealing. We loved the kitchen (although didn't get a chance to use it), and thought it very convenient that a washer and dryer were available. This house is nicely renovated/decorated (although not vegan, as you can probably tell by the photos) and felt cozy and welcoming. It was very clean and appealing. The showers had hot water and good water pressure, and there were clean/green personal care products available. Check in and checkout were effortless. I would love to stay here again if I am in the area."

My husband, on the other hand, complains how outside can see everything inside and how the light wakes him up in the morning. I guess, it depends if you like the sun. Everything you need are there. Thanks the host for stocking up amenities. One of the household rule is to keep the AC at a certain degree, which was fine for me. For other like my husband who aren't used to Phoenix heat may need to reconsider. Overall, I like this place. For a 2BR2B, it's a reasonable price. We stayed for two nights. I would stay here again, but asking my husband to use that squeegee as requested in the household rule is pain. Maybe if they change that request."

Stayed with kids","This Peoria casita was the ideal location for our family of four! The casita is located on in a quiet residential area, but only minutes from the grocery store, restaurants, and some local shops. The home was pristine; felt like new and very clean. It looked exactly like the photos online. We loved having a full kitchen and separate living space and even made use of the small yard with the kids during the day. Loved having laundry onsite as well! While the living room is certainly large enough for a pull-out if the owners ever consider it, the blow-up mattress was king-sized, comfortable and easy to use. We could have used some extra pillows since some of us sleep with more than one, and a few extra towels/wash cloths. We feel so lucky to have found this incredible house and hope to be back on our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","I went out of state for a funeral and when I was looking for an air bnb the only thing I was concerned about was how far it would be from the cemetery. This listing was highly rated and I was very surprised with how spacious it was once I arrived. It was very private and extremely clean. They had things like cotton swabs and cotton balls available which I thought was a nice touch to make us feel at home. The washer and dryer was in the room and I thought it would be loud but I just closed the door to the linen closet and I was able to sleep peacefully at night while doing my laundry. I highly recommend this air bnb. When I come back to Arizona I will book here again. The hosts were extremely helpful and kept checking in to make sure I was enjoying my stay. Considering the circumstances, I really did enjoy my time here."

Stayed a few nights","The abundance of 5 star reviews tells you all you need to know…Book it! And add an extra day because you will not want to leave. If peace can be found in a city, it’s right here, above it all. The view is sooo picturesque that it inspired us to be early birds for those few days we were here just to get the soonest glimpse. With a cup of tea in hand, we woke up everyday to a magnificent sunrise peaking out from behind the mountains. It was simply incredible. Though there was peace to be had, you could also find the city life not too far of a drive. The home was clean, the wifi strong, the bed/pillows comfortable, and the kitchen was well stocked. So if you’re looking for serenity with the option to go out for a good time, book here. If I’m ever back in Phoenix, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. I hope that you who are reading this gets to experience it for yourself. It’s special. Thank you Carla for sharing your home with us."

Stayed one night","There are some Airbnb’s that you stay in because you need a clean place to stay…
Then there are other Airbnb’s that you stay in because you want a break from the monotony of everyday life and have an extraordinary experience of being alive.
Carla’s place would definitely be the ladder.
To say this place is magical would be an understatement…
The experience of having a glass of wine while overlooking the aerial views of Phoenix as the sun sets is something you and your significant other will never forget.
The pictures don’t deliver on half of what you’ll feel when you stay here. It’s extremely clean, modern and well thought out.
You’ll be impressed with the fine details that have be laid out in every corner of the home.
If you want the experience or being alive don’t look at any other properties, this is the “one” you’ve been looking for.
And because you’ve read this entire review this is the sign that you need to book now before someone else does.
Enjoy"

Carla was very responsive and helpful with instructions on how to drive up the driveway and get in the house. The view is immaculate! Everything was clean and she even had snacks set out. The hot tub was warm and ready. Carla even had ramen noodle cups in the cabinet! I can’t recommend The Nest enough and I don’t usually stay at the same place twice but I would definitely come back here again!

The living area was comfy, the bedroom was peaceful, the bathroom was clean, the kitchen was super handy. One con: I got addicted to the Nespresso machine and had to order one for myself! Thanks a lot Carla!! The steep driveway was not nearly as scary as I thought it was going to be and parking and turning around were really easy. Incredibly thoughtful touches like menus to local restaurants that can deliver to a nest and the numbers for local massage people. Can’t recommend enough and can’t wait to come back!"

Incredible view of the whole valley, with beautiful sunrises and sunsets! The Nest is such a high-end and trendy place, but yet completely comfortable like home. The furnishing are hi-end, and the decorations are unique, creative and oh so trendy! Loved the kitchen ceiling light, the keg light over the sink, and the shelving unit under the bedroom TV is so swank!
The couch is extremely comfortable and reclines on both ends. It’s a toss up as to whether the couch or the bed is more comfortable!
We had breakfast on the deck every morning and enjoyed relaxing in the amazing jacuzzi in the evenings.
Carla is an exceptional host and responded immediately to all of our inquiries!! Her pride in The Nest is evident in the way she communicates with you! 5+ Star host all the way!
We look forward to returning to The Nest the next time we are in the Phoenix area! This is our #1 place to stay now! Loved it!"

Besides all the restaurant in Scottsdale we found a new Greek Mediterranean restaurant a few blocks away called The Palms Mediterranean on 12th at Northern that we did take out - yummy. Delivery is also an option.
Carla was a great host, responsive when you have a question and invisible when you want your privacy.

Attention has been paid to details like lots of towels, a well supplied kitchen, and instructions on anything that needs them (even the guitars hanging on the wall were in tune😬). The driveway is fun with just the right amount of scariness. The location is easy driving (within 20 min.)to all the best sights and lots of great restaurants. We would love to hang out here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I'm late to do this review because, quite honestly, I have not yet acclimated back to ""real life"". I stayed at Carla's place solo, my first Mom retreat, and it was everything I needed. Her place is magic! I was so sad to leave. Carla's home is gorgeous from every angle, and you feel at peqce from the moment you walk in. The views are breathtaking, and you feel like you are in your own private castle. the hot tub is especially fantastic. The bed was one, if not the, most comfortable I've ever slept in, to the point where I actually asked where she bought it! I have recommended this home to many friends already. It is the absolute perfect escape for a couple or, like me, a solo (and successful) reset mission. Thank you, Carla! My return trip is in the works!"

Stayed a few nights",The Nest was a perfect little getaway. It’s got everything you need to spend a weekend or a month. Incredibly beautiful views of mountains during the day and of the city lights at night. Situated on the very top of the hill and with large windows on every wall the 360 degree views are spectacular. I’d love to visit again as we didn’t get to try the jacuzzi or the secluded fire pit. We loved our stay and highly recommend a stay.

I am a local to Phoenix but wanted to find a staycation spot for my girlfriend's birthday that was private and had great views. I for sure made the right decision with this place. You can see every corner of the valley from the ""Nest"", sunrise and sunset are incredible!! If you are on the fence with a few places just book this one, you won't have any regrets. You'll mostly be looking at the great exterior views but inside is beautifully designed and has your convivence in mind. Carla was an amazing host and went above and beyond. It's a little pricey but in the end you will make priceless memories, it's worth it, just do it!"

It had everything I needed (cookware, snacks, condiments, oils, TP, paper towels, tissues, towels, lotion, toothpaste, soap, blankets…). It felt tranquil and secluded enough while also being easily accessible to delivery drivers. Would be perfect for long term stays for sure. I booked this place because I read another review that read something like “if you’re on the fence about staying here just do it”, and after my stay I agree completely. Just book it.
Tip: The outdoor shower is nestled among the rocks, totally private, and has a warm setting."

The space is very well designed with a clean aesthetic. It feels very secluded. LOVE THE OUTDOOR SHOWER ❤️
The hosts are very friendly and easy to communicate with. We will be back"

Stayed a few nights","the place was clean and easy to find. I wish there was a note on the listing about the airplane and train noises so we knew what to expect. host was not very responsive, I sent 3 different messages to finally get a response hours later. bath room door does not shut. It's like a cabinet door that does not line up to close fully. bed was comfortable, lots of pretty plants to look at, a pretty convenient location. overall, it was okay for a couple of nights, but I would not recommend anything longer."

Stayed one night","The place looks beautiful inside and out and the surrounding plants are gorgeous. But, at night, there are roaches everywhere outside. We were sprinting, trying our best to not let them inside. I definitely wouldn’t hang outside at night and it honestly made us not want to leave the Airbnb again once it was dark out. Also, I’m not sure I would recommend this place as a romantic getaway, as the bathroom door does not really shut like normal doors. So there’s not really any bathroom privacy. If that doesn’t bother you, than great. The location is good and close to all of the downtown Phoenix stuff. All in all, everything was fine!"

We used both the inside and outside shower and absolutely loved it! it's lovely to shower outside in the morning when the sun is starting to come up. The water pressure was great as well and there was already some soaps there for us as well. I would stay here again 😍"

Parking on the street was easy though I did have to park a few houses down. I’ve always felt a little uncomfortable parking on the street in front of other people’s homes but I felt safe parking where I did. Home is located in a gorgeous neighborhood.
Bathroom door situation was a little weird and didn’t really have much privacy as the folding doors don’t actually shut they kind of just touch.
Overall it was a great stay."

Be careful of bugs and mosquitos since there’s a lot of plants! We arrived really late due to delays and airport closures, so it was quite dark. Appreciated the automatic light sensors on the pathway to the back house. Main house was quiet, never saw anyone, so it was a fairly peaceful and quiet neighborhood. It had all the basic amenities. That portable steamer came very handy for our wedding attire! The shower concept threw me off. Water splashed everywhere and definitely not what I’m use to. Hosts lived down the street and Ron came by to say hi :) Hosts were very friendly and gave clear instructions."

We were able to drop bikes early before checking in and also leave some luggage past check out and pick it up before a late flight. The place was exactly as advertised, well equipped, private yet lots of sunshine, very comfy bed and well stocked. My wife and I just loved it and would highly recommend Patty and Ron’s place."

Stayed one night","Patty's guest studio is well-appointed, clean, cozy, and an architectural marvel. I loved the concrete and number of windows, as well as a fully stocked kitchen. The kitchen had goodies like granola bars, Cheezits, half and half, and gratefully, almond milk. Great lighting and aesthetics, as well as a nice hot shower and well-appointed bathroom with plush towels, shampoo, conditioner, salt scrub, blow-dryer. I didn't watch TV or use wi-fi, but it's all there. The bed was firm but not too firm and the linens clean and crisp. The only downsides, and this probably only applies to me and a few would-be guests, is that the pillows were too soft and the heater wasn't really strong enough to heat up the place. I was there during a rare cold and rainy day, but I can see the place being the perfect pad during the warmer months. I'm sure that in summer, the outdoor shower is a must-use! Overall, great value; Patty was extremely responsive with communication. I'd stay in summer in a heat-beat!"

From the outdoor shower, the privacy, the natural elements and the plants…you feel comforted and connected to the outdoors. I had enough space to lay out all my gear, pack accordingly, and wash up some dirty clothes after trekking through Aravaipa Canyon for 3.5 days. The bed does sit a little low to the ground, and it’s a little stiff. There is also some road noise that can be heard (cars passing, train horns, sirens etc.) but it didn’t bother me too much. Just thought it was worth the mention. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed for one night with our baby, Tasha and Brandon were very kind and accommodating. They made sure to have the pack and play ready for us. The Casita was cute and quaint, had everything we needed and more. It was very nice to have a cold bottle of water from the small fridge when we first arrived. I’m sure if we had stayed longer, we would have enjoyed all the casita has to offer. Tasha and Brandon were very quick and responsive. Definitely would recommend and definitely would come back for our future Phoenix visits."

Stayed one night","We, my girlfriend and I, had a wonderful stay. The casita is beautiful with a modern feel that made you feel at home from the moment you walked in.
All the amenities and extra touches you'd want were right there for you to use and enjoy. There was a great coffee maker (with plenty of coffee), a good size fridge, and a microwave. In the closet was extras like disposable plates, paper towels, and forks! The bathroom was great! Plenty of space for toiletries and the shower was nice and big! Water pressure was great and we had no problems getting hot water. There's even a hairdryer in the magic closet if you need it!
Lastly, there is a ceiling fan and a/c if you need air flow or to cool things down and again in the magic closet, a small space heater if you need warming up on those unexpected chilly days.
Our only suggestion is to upgrade the mattress to make the stay that much more perfect. Don't get us wrong, we'd happily stay here again in the future and would recommend to everyone!"

Stayed a few nights","The Casita was exactly what I needed for a couple of nights before embarking on a backpacking trip into the Superstition Mountains with REI. It’s easy to catch ride-share from here, so not having a car was no problem.
The place was very tidy and clean. It’s a charming little place with enough open floor space to do some yoga and spread out my gear before I loaded my pack for my backpacking adventure. Also, lots of towels available.
Tasha and Brandon responded quickly to my questions and messages. They were so quiet it felt like I was completely alone. If you’re looking for a private, cozy place to stay, this is the place. I’d definitely stay here again.
CAUTION: I took 2 Uber rides to the Casita and both times their drivers stopped a block over from the actual spot. I’m not sure what the error is in Uber’s system, but the pin gets dropped a street behind the actual home."

Stayed a few nights","Tasha and Brandon have created a really wonderful space for guests! They thought of every detail and made their casita welcoming, warm and cozy. When I arrived they had an essential oil diffuser running which smelled lovely! Plenty of towels and supplies, popcorn and coffee. The bed was comfortable and though it was chilly during my visit, I didn’t really need to use the heater much. The water in the bathroom gets very hot and shower has decent water pressure. I also appreciated the lighting options inside. I didn’t use the smart TV but it looked easy enough to navigate. Having a desk was great for some remote work during my stay, and the internet was reliable and easy to connect to. I have stayed in a lot of airbnbs over the years and really rank this one high on the top of my list. If I’m back in Phoenix I would happily book again! If you need a cozy spot not far from resort conference centers, I highly recommend Tasha and Brandon’s delightful casita! Thanks for a great stay."

The only way I could get it to come on when I wanted to was by reaching out to the host. On day three I came back to the place being 85 degrees. I couldn’t get in touch with the host so it was an awful night.

Check in was very simple, as was locating the casita. They kindly had a supply of coffee with creamer available, oatmeal, and water bottles in the fridge.
The only thing I wish they had was a spot to sit outside to enjoy the weather and drink coffee! This is simply personal preference as I love drinking my morning coffee outside!
Wonderful overall value! Tasha & Brandon were great hosts, thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","I recently stayed at Donna's Airbnb for a couple of nights. While the early check-in process was smooth and the place itself is great, well-stocked, and has comfortable beds and furniture, plus a fantastic backyard and pool, I had an unfortunate experience with the grilling amenities.
There were two propane grills, and neither one was operable. I messaged the host to notify her about my findings, and this is when she mentioned that it was stated in the listing to ""BBQ GRILL provided, just bring the propane"" along with a story as to why. This was a first for me, as I've never been told to bring my own propane for a grill at an Airbnb, not in all my years and hundreds of rentals. For this reason, I won’t choose this property next time I’m in the area.
Despite this hiccup, the rest of the stay was enjoyable, and the property is well-maintained. The home is beautiful and well-furnished, and the pool is wonderful and warm."

Although no fault of the hosts, the (apparently) very popular nearby haunted house and pumpkin patch were a bit noisy after dark. It wasn't horrible and I'm sure it only happens a few weekends out of the year. By no means a deal-breaker.
The pool area is very nice, and the living area is a great space to hang out and enjoy each other's company. Huge televisions in every bedroom.
All in all, we had a lovely stay, and I would recommend this property. Thank you for helping to make my daughter's graduation a special and memorable experience."

Group trip","Pros:
Good location. Easy check in. Wi-Fi. Smart TVs in every room. Well stocked. Low noise levels. Clean. Friendly and responsive host.
Areas of improvement:
-Non functioning A/C. It was cold majority of the time. temperature hovered around 66 degrees.
-pet hairs on the sofa and the master bed.
-Low privacy levels in the dining area by the kitchen and front door and side window.
-Not being allowed to use the garage was an minor inconvenience. We had to park on the street."

We found it 10-15 minutes from everything except the hike we choose, which was 25 minutes away...and an easy drive! We loved the variety of spaces to hang out together and have quiet conversations together. We would highly recommend this wonderful 4 bedroom, 3 bath home within a quiet and quaint neighborhood!!"

Check-in was seamless and easy and we loved the friendly and peaceful neighbourhood. The area is great with many restaurants, coffee shops, a great park nearby and the Altitude trampoline park that the kids loved. The house is furnished with all the necessities and we swam daily in the pool, and soaked in the hot tub. The kids also loved the arcade games and ping pong, and the TV's in each bedroom. We would definitely stay at this home again."

We spent a full day lounging in the pool while cooking a few meals on the grill and having a ping pong tournament in the evening. The location is good with easy access to most anything you could need or want in the area. This may be one of the nicest AirBnB places we've stayed. The only downside we had was that the bed in the master suite was very soft, too soft for our liking, but opinions may vary. We are already talking about coming back for another stay and bringing more family."

Group trip","Highly HIGHLY recommend this beautiful home! Probably one of the top, if not THE top, Airbnb I've ever stayed at. It had everything our group of 5 needed, and could definitely accommodate a larger group per what the listing describes.
The house was clean, very spacious, beautifully decorated, and well equipped with everything needed in the kitchen. The pool was super clean and very refreshing. We spent peaceful mornings outside having coffee, and the patio area was great for hanging out. On top of a beautiful home, Dohl was amazing, super friendly, and quick to reply to messages.
Extra kudos for all the special touches. There were towels for the pool, a fresh bag of ice in the freezer, fully stocked coffee area with coffee pods/syrup, and the individually packaged condiments in the fridge.
We feel SO grateful to have spent our time in Phoenix at this beauty, and hope to stay again! Thank you Dohl for being an outstanding host!"

This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and I was shocked at how GREAT it went. I read the review before mine and my brother said it was a fake review. Now leaving this review I understand why.

The Butterfly Studio was a perfect size and as usual had everything we needed and even the things we didn't know we needed like snacks and a huge coffee variety! Beds and linens are so comfortable! We lucked out with mild weather for late April and were able to play cards and have wine outside. The shared yard/resort area makes this a little get away even if it was move out week for college. There are other people in the house and Garden Studio, but there is plenty of privacy and the outdoor spaces have enough room where we can do our own thing--like a hotel patio. We love it here, it is always the first place we check when we come to visit GCU--but they book fast! Thanks for a great visit."

Stayed a few nights","Nate and Steven's Butterfly Studio is beautifully done. It was just right for our family of three. Everything in the studio is at hand's reach yet it is spacious!! The outdoor area is great to have lunch / chill. All in all we found the place to be very clean, it matched the description and photos and the hosts were super responsive. Would definitely recommend this Airbnb!"

The hosts are terribly kind and helpful whenever the need arises. Convenient to everything you would want to be in easy distance of. The Toasted Owl was particularly fun(MidMod goodies for sale!). We bought a glass owl cookie jar and ate scrumptious vegan tamales. Would recommend this get-away to anyone!

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic Stay!
I needed a place to stay after our AC went out and had spent the day overheated & stressed ( me and my two dogs). I booked the Airbnb in a hurry and was disheveled … to be honest didn’t read the instructions super thoroughly. When I arrived, after 10 pm, the hosts were super responsive and helpful in helping me get in.
There was a slight issue during check in and they immediately upgraded me to a larger Airbnb on property. That was really kind and impressive.
The neighborhood is really nice & quiet. Central Phoenix can be hit or miss on the areas in some pockets, but this spot is very quiet and safe. You’ll be very close to plenty of local favorite dining options like Joyride Taco, First draft book bar and our personal fave, Clever Koi. The house is eclectic, artistic and well designed with lots of amenities like surround sound, outdoor seating, super soft sheets & a spa like shower & soaking tub.
10/10 and can’t wait to return under better circumstances!"

This little hideaway invites you in with a vibrant, cheerful, and peaceful mood of color and ambiance created through pictures, furniture and comfort. It acheives zen. I wished we could have stayed longer or just moved in! The second you enter the yard it's like a luxury private villa hidden in a local neighborhood. My husband wants to keep the bed and that is the highest compliment. It felt so comfortable and homey. I loved the bath ammenities, having a new washer/dryer with eco soap provided, the super comfy couch, and the excellent layout. Their was plenty of room for my dogs, parking, and a nice neighborhood to walk around. I can't say enough about how wonderful our stay was. Thank you Nate and Steven"

Not to mention the neighborhood is quaint and in close proximity to great food. I went to CorePower in the AM (5 min away) and strolled to brunch after. I’d love to stay here again. Super easy check-in and Nate and Steven are also very responsive. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet",This is definitely a must-book in Phoenix! My bf and I stayed here a couple of nights to check out some schools and went to a comedy show as well. We felt right at home and there wasn’t anything missing from this cute home. There’s another studio right next to this one but everyone was respectful and quiet. Noise was never an issue. Sweet little retreat. Thanks Nate and Steven :)

Pros:
Good location for activities in the city
Cute aesthetics with cool antiques
Cozy living space in open floorplan
Very comfy bed
Quick, easy laundry access
Spacious minifridge
Cons:
Kitchen and bathroom not very functional – best for only a short stay
Water was always lukewarm, never hot or cold
Some very loud music nearby all day the first day of our stay (could have been a one-time thing!)"

Stayed with a pet","Phoenix is a huge city and I don't claim to know much about its various districts and suburbs but we did enjoy our time in the area surrounding this Airbnb. Within walking distance is a gourmet grocery store and a few restaurants, I was surprised to find a reasonable sushi experience that didn't involve driving across town! We didn't take the public transit but I did notice that it would be super easy to do so from Nate & Steven's house. The space itself is great, these guys really put a lot of effort into the communal areas and we enjoyed relaxing out there under the ample shade. Laundry machines were modern and cleaned/dried without issue.
The studio space was fine, the key elements were great: comfy king bed, well-functioning air conditioning, and a fancy shower experience. Bathroom and kitchen areas were clean, kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. The only downside to mention was that the floors were sticky and dirty in spots but this has to be the fault of the cleaners (I've messaged the hosts to make sure they address this) -- easily rectifiable. Other than that we had a restful time here and feel recharged to continue our adventures!"

Any time we are in Phoenix and need a little private retreat from the heat (or family haha), our first thought is to see if Nate & Steven have availability. Thanks again, Nate & Steven! A+++"

We arrived at 2 AM due to airport delays, etc. and it was very easy to follow written instructions to unlock the gate and use the code to get in the unit. The bed was so comfortable that I had to remove the sheets before leaving so that I can consider buying this brand. The backyard was shared by three units but we were out there alone when using it. Beautiful, sunny Phoenix made is a pleasure to catch a little outside relaxation. The only complaint we had is that the water pressure is very low and so it was a little inconvenient for washing the dishes in the sink and bathroom needs. Otherwise, just perfect little stay."

They were super accommodating w/ my emotional support animal. They were easy to reach when I had a few tech issues, and they were incredibly prompt and helpful in resolving them. The bed was quite comfortable and they had nearly every amenity you could need in the kitchen area. Nate and Steven also have really outdone themselves with the outdoor, shared common area space. They had a beautiful BBQ, so many areas to sit and chill, maybe a firepit, and all kind of lawn games, including cornhole and 'yard-zhee.' My only regret is that I didn't book 1-2 more nights after my conference so I could really chill and enjoy the outdoor area more. I can't wait to stay here again!"

First off, we’d like to extend our deepest gratitude to our hosts for accommodating us on such short notice, especially considering our large group and pets. Their flexibility and hospitality truly saved our trip.
Upon arrival, we were immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the house. It’s not often you find a place that looks just as pristine in person as it does in photos, but this house did not disappoint. Every room was spotlessly clean, which made for a very comfortable and welcoming stay.
The kitchen deserves a special mention. It was fully stocked with all the essentials we could possibly need — and then some. Cooking for a large family can be a daunting task, but the availability of various utensils, pots, pans, and appliances made meal preparation not only easy but enjoyable. It felt like a home away from home!"

The live plants were a nice touch. My wife kept talking about how typically people use fake plants. She’s a green thumb and it just made her night.
She had snacks in the fridge for the kiddos. Milk & juice too.
We were able to pull right up into the garage and unload the car. Which made for a perfect load up and go the next morning as it was raining and we didn’t have to worry about getting wet. That was convenient.
If we are ever back traveling through we will check to see if her place is available again. Thanks for a cozy nights stay."

Stayed with a pet",This was my second time staying at Suzette’s. She’s a great communicator; instructions are clear and check-in is a breeze. It’s in a very nice neighborhood and it’s always a plus having a garage. The snacks/samplings are so thoughtful and another huge plus… as well as the handwritten note. More importantly maybe - my dog loves the house and patio. Until next time…

That is not the case with other Airbnb’s we have stayed at in the past and it was such a welcome addition to our stay. Her home was spotless and so cozy too. The towels and linens were the same quality found in nice hotels. It is in a quiet neighborhood and is close to so many amenities. Suzette was very accommodating ( a had a few requests for my disabled son ). We would definitely stay here again if we visit the Phoenix area in the future. Thank you again Suzette for hosting us!"

House was well maintained with a beautiful backyard with plenty of seating, plenty for the kids and pets to do! host had plenty of coffee and snacks available, as well as different games and books to read. of you would rather watch TV than you have the option of a TV in every room. highly recommended and would say again!"

Stayed with a pet","If I could give Suzette and her wonderful Windchime House 10 stars I would! First of all, she is hands down the most thoughtful AirBnb host I've ever encountered. Not only was the house spotless (and absolutely adorable), but there were SO many sweet personal touches that she added. From a handwritten card welcoming us to her home, to a fruit bowl on the dining table, a bowl of snacks on the counter, a bowl of candies on the side board, to travel size toothpaste and shampoo/conditioner in the bathrooms. The home is PERFECT for dog owners. There was a super comfy dog bed in the living space, and even a dog bowl set for food and water. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The A/C was on point. The kitchen was nicely appointed for anyone who wants to cook a full meal. The house is set up with a multitude of free streaming apps. They have a built-in bookcase full of (good) books and an even better selection of games. The outdoor space offers multiple choices to sit and relax. 10 STARS!"

The amenities stacked were helpful as I was hungry when I reached and did not have to step out to find a restaurant immediately. Suzette had some snacks, milk and fruits set u before the arrival. It allowed me to relax after a long drive. I did not need to use the restaurants but there were a lot of food places and fuel stations near by. Overall great experience . I wished I could have stayed longer and will definitely book this place if I come back."

The only thing is we had a little trouble closing the garage door, but that’s probably because I’ve never used a garage before. 😅 other than that, we really appreciated all the amenities. She had a bunch of snacks made available and coffee bar with to-go cups. There were games and activities in the back yard. Our pup had a large yard to run around and play too!

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved staying at Suzette’s airbnb. It is impeccably clean, the sheets and towels are so soft and plush, and we had plenty of space to make ourselves at home. We were traveling with our two large dogs, and with them comes a lot of stuff, and we had plenty of space for all of it. But most importantly, our dogs felt at home with a great yard with shade and shrubs and smells, a basket of dog toys and dog bowls, and nice cool tile floors inside. Suzette goes above and beyond to make you feel at home with a welcome note and snacks and drinks in the fridge, including fresh fruit. All these touches make such a difference. I got sick on our last day and was able to book an extra day to rest before hitting the road - it helped that I was in a place as comfortable as Suzette’s. We are very grateful for her hospitality, and look forward to staying here again."

Ample snacks for the kiddos, toys for the dog, comfy bed, and sooo clean! She even left us a personal handwritten note. It all felt so intentional and thoughtful."

Stayed a few nights","I consider myself an Airbnb connoisseur (as a former Airbnb host and frequent user) and I think that this is among the best Airbnbs I've stayed in. There were many thoughtful touches, high quality linens, beverages, fruit, and snacks, fully stocked kitchen, outlets on the nightstands for charging, an empty two car garage, and a note from the host upon our arrival. Although we didn't have kids or dogs with us, we noted that the listing had a dog bed, bowls, bags, and a pack n play with mattress and fitted sheet, high chair, and a variety of books and games. I was also impressed by the different products in the house, and the information sheets/QR codes about them. Essentially, it has everything that you would want in a place you are traveling, but also many personal touches, including plants. Communication with Suzette was easy. This place would be great for a long term stay. I would definitely stay here again if I'm in this part of Phoenix in the future."

Suzette had EVERYTHING my tired kids and I could have possibly wanted. We booked at the last minute when a baseball tournament went too long for us to return home the same day. Suzette had the house ready for us to check into in under an hour, had snacks for the teens and refreshments for all! Teens had board games and each had a TV in their rooms. I had all the amenities I needed to cook a quick, healthy supper for an exhausted group of kids. If we need a house in this neighborhood again for a tournament we will absolutely be back!"

She also left us many snacks, drinks and fruit as well as a greeting card, which let us felt very welcomed. We wish we could stay longer. Plus if you want to take the hot air balloon, the house is only within 10 min drive to the gathering place for hot air balloon, which is very convenient if you need to take the sunrise ride. highly recommend."

The place is wonderful! It’s a very beautiful house, clean and spotless, spacious, comfy and great vibes. The beds are very comfortable, towels and linens are top quality, the shower is great, overall a great experience staying at Suzette’s home! I seriously recommend that you book this place, you won’t regret it! It’s a million times better than a hotel! Snacks provided are such a nice touch! And on top of that, access to the garage (2 car) is great, especially if you’re on a road trip and want to store your car safely and away from the heat.
Do yourself a favor, and book this place. I will for sure come back some day, and will tell my friends and family about it!"

Garage parking was nice to have and keep the car out of the heat. Home was very clean and had many personal touches from the host that made us feel welcome. Very close to water park and restaurants. Home cooled very well and we slept great on the beds and pillows. We would definitely stay here on any future trip to the area. Well worth the price. By far the best of the 6 homes we stayed in on our family vacation!!

The plants located throughout the home gave the home a warm, inviting touch. She left snacks and drinks for us, which were great to snack on, while we figured out groceries. The backyard was peaceful and we spent a lot of time back there! OH MY GOODNESS and the bed in the primary suite…if I could’ve stayed there ALL day I would’ve! Definitely will be purchasing some of those pillows!! This will forever be our Airbnb when we visit Phoenix!! Thanks Suzette for being an amazing host and literally thinking of everything to ensure my family was comfortable!"
