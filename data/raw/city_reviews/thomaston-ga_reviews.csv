Stayed a few nights","Listing is exactly as described. Pictures are accurate. The garage apartment is attached to a nice house in a safe neighborhood. It was very clean. Private, easy check in and out with detailed instructions provided and local restaurant recommendations. I can’t think of a thing that could have made it better. We will rent again when in this area!"

The property is located in a very private location with absolutely no outside noises heard during my stay. The property is spotless, tidy and had everything I needed to make my stay pleasant, comfortable and totally enjoyable. It truly felt like a warm and inviting home. I am looking forward to my next visit to Thomaston, GA so that I can book this property again!"

Stayed with kids","Nana's Retreat was great except for the pool that was advertised and pictured as clean and clear water was anything but. The inside of the home was very clean and well maintained. Check in instructions were very clear and everything was easy to locate. I loved the thought to have extra towels and linens ready for guests. Other than missing out on enjoying some pool time in this hot Georgia weather, everything was hospitable about Nana's Retreat. Hayley was very easy to contact and she did inform me of the pool having issues the day before check in. I was under the impression it was still swimmable, but unfortunately due to recent heavy rains, it absolutely wasn't.
If you're looking for a clean place to lay your head for a night or two with a friendly host, then this is the place."

Stayed a few nights","This place is lovely! If you’re able and willing to walk upstairs to this darling above the garage apartment, you’ll be in heaven! They have a spacious place, sweet decor, kindly offer snacks and the bed is cozy. You’ll appreciate this stay!! We were in this town for family. Wishing I was back at The Country cupboard & deli eating some of the best food again and snuggling in this sweet apartment. It is such a refreshing and quiet place to sit and drink hot tea and relax from life’s wild ride. Book them! You won’t regret it. Shower pressure was great too! Even easier clean up!! Don’t worry about getting a motel in town, stay here!!"

I was in town for my father's funeral and it felt like I was staying with family. It was exactly what I needed instead of a cold hotel room. Yet, the amenities of a hotel are there including complimentary coffee, snacks, and toiletries. If it hadn't been January, I would have taken full advantage of the lovely pool/bar area. For my first AirBNB experience, I'm so glad I chose Hayley and Nana's Retreat!"

There were plenty of standard things (towels, hand soap, shampoo)and some thoughtful additions (razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, pots to cook in in the kitchen, actual dishes to use,bottled water, soda, coffee, and.. ICECREAM! :-) included in our room. And there were fireflies that came out at night which I adored, having not seen them since I was a kid. There was also other wildlife in the area which made it a very enjoyable and refreshing stay. Definitely book it if you're considering!"

At night, we were able to see the stars and hang out by the fire! Wayne was extremely responsive to anything we needed and was the cherry on top of this entire trip.

Still, it was a big shock when we looked into an earth hole and not at the lake upon arrival. A note that it disappeared from a dam some time ago would have been nice! Since we actually came because of the lake.
We made the most of it and still enjoyed our time very much. Morning and evening watching the deer and taking the chance to make a campfire at the fire pit.
The house is rustically equipped and the pets are allowed is not to be overlooked."

The location is only 5 minutes from Woodbury's sweet little downtown, where we ate breakfast and lunch, plus did a little antiquing. We were in town for a friend's wedding at Wild Daisy Farms, which was also only 5 minutes from the airbnb. We couldn't have asked for a lovelier weekend and will definitely be back soon."

He gave us a great list of places to eat locally and showed us a nice walking trail around the pond behind the cabin. It did rain most of the time we were staying here which wasn’t a problem since the cabin is so relaxing. We sat by fireplace and just watched the rain out the back porch windows. Mr Wayne made our stay feel right at home and even left us a bottle of wine in honor of our wedding. We can’t wait to make this cabin a yearly tradition.

Stayed with kids","Nicole and her husband are very great hosts that made sure that we had everything that we needed.The cabin was very cozy and relaxing.The beds we soft as a feather and my family really enjoyed the place.The cabin has wifi but,is not that great and there are no tvs in the bedrooms, but this was fine because Nicole let us know ahead of time so we just brought our own. The pond was very relaxing and its was so peaceful just looking at the water. These were the best hosts that i ever had with airbnb, because they were very responsive.The landscaping around the cabin could use a little tlc and beautifying, but outside of that,it was a great place to stay and i would highly recommend staying here. Will be staying here again really soon."

It was nice to have a shower option too! Beds were comfy! The pond and fishing equipment was a nice bonus! Kitchen was well stocked & appropriate for a family. AC came in handy! Nicole was prompt with communication. Great option for a few days! Good place for the grandkids!"

We both loved the location, the property, the things to do, and all the animals! There are parks, home style cooking, and antique stores all very close. We enjoyed walking the property to befriend the animals, play horseshoes, and use the firepit. Very quiet and relaxed and a great place to unplug for a little while."

Such a cool, relaxing, and peaceful place to stay. We’d love to go back and be able to take full advantage of the beautiful and unique surroundings. So whether you’re there for a nearby wedding or for a long, relaxing weekend, we highly recommend."

The owners pups were so sweet!! And Mr. Cat spent every night on the outside chair. He was adorable! Beds were super comfy, nice bed sheets, and super cozy. It was in the 30’s outside, but we had enough blankets to keep us warm. Everything in the home worked, and everything was clean. We really enjoyed the fireplace so much! Owners were awesome to work with. Super responsive and super nice!"

We would visit again.

Don't expect modern or fancy, and it might get a bit hot on summer days (has A/C, but with limits), but otherwise a great choice if you like simple and old fashioned. Our family of 6 was comfortable and the hosts are great communicators and available nearby if any problems (there were none)."

The cabin was very clean and comfortable and exactly what was advertised for the cabin. My family was there for a wedding at Frog Hollow that was just down the road, so the cabin was in the perfect spot for this. We loved fishing off the dock and walking to see the animals on the farm. We were greeted everyday by Mountain, the big white dog. He spent lots of time on our front porch and back deck. We loved our stay and will definitely come back and stay again when we come to see our family in Georgia. Thank you Nicole for making our stay a great one to remember."

They are absolutely charming, and the PERFECT place to unwind and relax. We stayed up late into the night lounging in the living room, and slept very well on some of the most comfortable beds and pillows I’ve ever laid on.
We were there for a wedding; there was plenty of hot water for everyone to shower and get ready all at the same time.
Mary Pat and Rick provided a fabulous backdrop for a fabulous weekend. I sincerely hope we can come back again for another couples retreat.
Note: we had 3 couples and 3 kids in 2 cabins and there was plenty of room for everyone"

We didn’t make it to dicky farms for ice cream but we were told by multiple people that it was the best . . The next day we kayaked sprewell bluff on the flint river with flint river outfitters.

The inside was well stocked with towels, extra bedding, all kitchen necessities, and even a few toys for the kids. They do have quite a few antiques throughout the cabin, which was really cool. It was nice and spacious. The outside was on a beautiful piece of land with a nicely stocked lake and a row boat. My whole family came out and we had the best reunion. We were able to grill out on the back porch and make smores in a separate area on the side of the cabin in a fire pit. Mary Pat was an outstanding host and was just a phone call away if we needed her. However, we didn't need anything that wasn't already provided. We had the best time and would definitely like to rent again in the near future. If you're considering renting an airbnb in the Thomaston area, I highly recommend this cabin. There is also another cabin located on this property that is available to rent as well."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I booked this cabin a bit last minute to get away. We didn’t really know what to expect. This cabin was WAY more than expected. First of all the location is amazing. Mary Pat told us a park (Sprewell Bluff) to go hiking. It’s a ten minute drive and a MUST DO. The hiking trails are great but the river is the best part. We went tubing down the river, cooked out on the grill, and hung out at the park all day. Highly recommend it !
The cabin is so cozy and cute. We made s’mores by the fireplace, hopped in the row boat out back, and even got to see the goats and horse in the morning behind the cabin.
The town is about 15 min away and there’s a restaurant we loved (fish peddler).
Mary Pat was very responsive and I appreciate it (I know we messaged her quite a few times)
The WiFi wasn’t the best. We only needed it to watch a pay-per-view that we ordered one night... but luckily there’s a TON of dvds in the laundry shed that we chose from. Overall, had such a great time."

We took the small boat out a couple of times, fished a bit on the beautiful pond, wondered around to see the farm animals and mostly just stayed indoors (Due to weather) playing games and enjoying the fireplace. The cabin has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The master bed was very comfortable as well. The cabin is the perfect place to get back to the simple life!"

I know everyone says this but the DOGS are the best entertainment you could ask for. They “took care” of the little ones by staying by their side. We tried to figure out how to take them with us but the girls said they would be too sad to leave their home!! Folks the water is delightful!! The drinking water is a great surprise. I recommend coming here for a little RnR but look out you won’t want to leave.

Donna's place was perfect for us not to have to travel very far. There was an emergency with a niece's son. He had been at basketball camp for 3 days and the timing was off for picking him up, getting him home and cleaned up in time to get to the wedding. Donna allowed my niece & husband to stop at her place to get him cleaned up. This was so kind of her and it worked out perfectly! We loved being in the country. A perfect place for myself, husband, brother & sister-in-luv to have. We appreciated all the communication with Donna! What a gem!! We were blessed and would definitely stay again!! A++++++++++"

Stayed a few nights","Donna’s place was perfect for my friend and I! We booked it to do an online seminar where we knew we would be super loud, dancing, and yelling super late every night. It being detached and away from their house made it perfect (we did still let them know what we were doing and check that it would be okay before we booked though).
We felt completely safe and comfortable. It was bigger than we thought it would be from the pictures. It had a fully stocked kitchen with everything we needed to cook including salt, pepper, and some spices. There were also plenty of snacks we were told we could help ourselves to. It had two nice big TVs and was decorated cute for the season. Donna gifted us some of her friend’s homemade soap that was so sweet and let us check out super late since she didn’t have anyone checking in the next day, which allowed us to get extra sleep that we were really grateful for.
The beds were really comfortable as well! We did not get a chance to use the pool because of weather and being busy with our seminar.
Would highly recommend, including to just have a nice little getaway from Atlanta and hang out for a day or two."

The home itself is both adorable & comfortable, filled with thoughtful touches like extra toiletries and snacks for late-night cravings. It truly felt like a home away from home. We also enjoyed the beautiful scenery that added a perfect backdrop to our stay & morning coffee on the porch.
Peggy's hospitality didn't stop at just amenities; her warm conversations & the stories about her house restoration further enriched our experience. If you're looking for a cozy and inviting place to stay, Peggy’s Bed and Breakfast is the ideal choice. Thank you, Peggy, for a fantastic weekend!"

Around every corner both inside the home, on the porch, and in the garden, whimsical little gems continue to reveal themselves. I look forward to visiting again when the garden is at its full expression. When you visit, please take time to give Llama the cat a few pets from his pal Slade."

The bed super comfortable giving us a good night’s sleep!
We appreciated Peggy’s prompt communication, willingness to accept our late arrival and greeting us.
We had private bath (hot water and excellent pressure in shower) and set off private area with microwave and refrigerator and bottled spring water where she has all sorts of offerings for breakfast: coffee, teas, delicious home made muffins, fresh fruit, refrigerator stocked with yogurt, Sprite, OJ; small crockpot, toaster, all sorts of cooking utensils.
She has even stocked the bath with lotions, bath items, and anything a traveler may have forgotten.
We have stayed at many Airbnb’s throughout US and have to say Peggy’s is tops! We wish we could have stayed for more than one night just to soak in the beauty of her grounds so encourage you to book!!"

Upon learning that I was there to be alone for my wedding anniversary after losing my husband, she gave me flowers and a gift card. As a widow, it made my heart feel more at ease. Most people wouldn't think to be so kind. The little coffee/tea nook was adorable, stocked with anything you would need for a continental breakfast. The bathroom was also stocked if you forgot anything.

Stayed a few nights","My overall feeling was that I visited a distant relative who forgot that I was coming and did their best to get ready.
Pros: The beds were very comfortable and even my dad slept well.
Cons: The first two are the most important because they negate the ADA compliance and pose a health concern.
1. The ramps to the unit were covered in leaves, sticks and other debris. This was a trip and slip hazard for my 78 year old dad and those that rely on ADA compliant ramps. When I messaged the host she replied “ We blow the ramps off often but there are so many leaves that it’s impossible to keep up.”.
2. There were mouse droppings under the sink
3. The right half of the couch does not recline (as experienced when sitting on the couch)
4. There were several inches of ash from previous guests left in the fireplace
5. There were crumbs or dirt on the couch cushions. It looked like the living room was not cleaned after the previous guest"

My family really liked seeing all the animals on the property, they are all very friendly and entertaining. It was nice being able to walk out the back door and be able to fish and have the cows come running up to the fence to greet you on the way . They have a nice covered deck by the pond to sit and relax or fish off of. If you’re looking for a peaceful and relaxing place to unwind this is it. It’s also pet friendly, which was a huge plus for us since we were traveling with our dog . We will definitely be back when visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","Start off by saying, WOW, what an experience! Would we go back or recommend this place to anyone? Definitely!
The reason we were going to be in the area was to attend our grandson’s wedding at a venue about 2-miles away. There were eight of us: all adults. All of us were coming from out of state.
Last fall we were visiting family in McDonough, so we took the opportunity to start looking around. We looked at hotels in Thomaston and other towns nearby. It was obvious that we didn’t want to drive through the countryside at night. So, I went online and looked for an Airbnb. This Airbnb got my attention due to its location and how interesting it looks on the website. We drove out to see it and once we did that, we booked both cabins.
We found the cabins very clean with all the amenities of home: nice beds, a well-stocked kitchen with all the appliances, toiletry items and even coffee. We found sitting outside on the front porch in the morning a treat: quiet except for the rooster crowing."

The kitchen is well-stocked with plenty of pots and pans and utensils, there is a fridge/freezer and stove/oven. and there is a grill right outside the back door on the patio. The bathroom has a walk-in shower as well as a claw foot bathtub. There are also laundry facilities in a separate building very close by.
The pond is a short walk away, and there are donkeys and cows to visit as well. There is plenty of land to take a nice long walk without going on the road.
There is a Dollar General about 5 mins away, and grocery stores about 15 mins away in Thomaston.
Nicole was very responsive to emails and even emailed to check in with me to make sure I had everything I needed.
All in all, this was an awesome place to stay. I would definitely return."

Stayed with kids","We don’t get to travel often because we have a special needs child that requires skilled nurses when we aren’t with her. We needed just a quick night away, to get our other children out of the house and time to just be normal kids for once. We couldn’t go far. Nicole’s cabin is only 40 minutes from our home but it felt like we were a hundred miles away. The farm animals were so much fun for our boys and my 4 year old caught his first fish on the dock. My teenager did have a few opinions about the antique dolls used for decor. He was convinced one was the Annabelle doll and we had brought him to a haunted cabin in the woods. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣 Once we hid the “Annabelle” doll, he still insisted on sleeping in the living room but he did have a blast! Disclaimer: The cabin is NOT haunted. 🤭 But I did get a very distinct feeling that George Washington may have lived there at one point, if GW had a power recliner and massive shower room."

Stayed with kids","This is a wonderful place full of charm, but may not be for all-comers… at least for now. We encountered a bit of disrepair in the form of wood rot on decking that gave-way underfoot. This was quickly repaired, but could be a real problem for a disabled person.
TV options are limited to DVDs, and though WiFi is available, you won’t be streaming above SD at the speeds offered. You’ll need to remember to bring your streaming box from home to make that work.
Still, you don’t come to a place like this to sit on the couch. Outside the pond awaits with fishing from the pier or paddle boat. There are lots of trails to locations around the property with animals etc. There are numerous destinations nearby with plenty of local flavor.
The amenities are bespoke and vary from subpar to excellent, so YMMV in terms of experience. The electric stove eyes were uneven and hard to work with effectively, but the shower was wide comfortable and very relaxing. The master bed has a great mattress and sleeps well, but the chairs are all hard wood and uncushioned except for one love-seat in the living room. The dock and pound are a great place to spend the day fishing or just relaxing, but slippery planks and wood rot may make the walk too it feel less than safe.
I can recommend for people who know what they are getting into and are willing to go the rough edges to enjoy a real rustic experience. The price is very affordable for what you get and being ‘pet friendly’ is an awesome added bonus. For the elderly, the disabled, or the very young; despite its appeal, this property is in need of investment to be comfortable for all guests."

We enjoyed the break from technology with the ability to connect. WiFi in the cabin. The posting was completely accurate and super easy to check in/out. Will definitely stay here again in the future.

Stayed one night","If you're into antiques, history or the feeling of stepping back in time, this should be on your list of must stay locations! Mary Pat and her Husband Rick have created a very special place here inside and out. Although we only stayed overnight, a family could easily enjoy a few days of old timeyness and enjoy the outdoorsas well. It's definitely not your typical experience, but that's what this location is all about. One thing to take note of, there is a fairly strong musty smell that would likely bother anyone sensitive to that sort of thing. I have respiratory issues, and one night is all I could handle. That being said, I'm glad we stoppedand experienced what they had to offer. Mary Pat and Rick were great hosts, very attentive and quick to respond."

My kids spent each night and each morning running around the large property looking for the owners goats! We only stayed two nights and we planned other activities in town, but a couple more nights would have been great. I’m sure you could just let time pass sitting outside on the porch or around the fire. FYI The rain on the metal roof will put you right out. The tv takes DVD’s only and there is a collection in the joint laundry room.
We will be back!"

The dogs are absolutely the sweetest. The water was great. And the fishing was great. We came to hang out and fish, and that is exactly what we got. Everything was just as I expected. Didn't meet Mary Pat,but I did have the pleasure of meeting Rick. Who was really cool and hospitable. I recommend this to any with kids. Bring them fishing, walk the farm. And just relax.

Stayed with kids","We loved staying at Mary Pat's and Rick's cabin! We loved having the lake there for my 10 yr old daughter to learn how to fish. Every morning when she woke up, she would change and head over to the lake to practice. We also loved the ramp from Cabin 2 leading all the way to the lake. We enjoyed having their Great Pyrenees dogs visit us everyday and sometimes staying overnight at the door. Our 2 little pups had a blast there as well sniffing the grounds and just being outside. It was such a treat staying at this 1800 cabin. It's also just a few min away from Sprewell Bluff which is such a nice park close to the Flint River. We will definitely stay here again the next time we drive to TN from FL."

We stayed for 8 days. Our son fished and hiked, we ran, played with the goats and were able to work. The WiFi connection was good.
It was great to be able to do laundry too. Mary Pat and Rick are wonderful hosts.
The cabin was perfect for our family of four. The bedrooms are large and we even brought our dogs’ crates and they fit. Our son loved the loft! The cabin is rustic but it has WiFi and airco!
The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. We even got a few fresh eggs from Mary Lats chickens.
Overall it was a perfect place to spend time away from home."

Stayed a few nights","Mary Pat and her husband are two wonderful people and their spirit is reflected throughout the cabins and the property. I have always loved log cabins especially really old genuine ones and staying there was a dream come true. Although it might have been a little rougher without the plumbing and electricity way back when... I kept finding details that I had not seen at first glance and it made me smile every time as I recognized the same sweet touch. The bathroom had everything we needed and quaint touches all over it too. I am a gardener and my heart was glad to see each blossom reflect the owner's love and care. Although Mary Pat and her husband were not on the property during our stay (someone else was keeping the grounds), we were warmly greeted by their furry friends who were a nice presence for our son. I must say I enjoyed them too!
He very much enjoyed fishing at the pond even though this time he had the right equipment but did not get a catfish (last time the catfish broke his line)...However, he hardly had time to put his bait in the water before he would get something on the line! I had never seen so much fish! The fishing deck is so well thought of with its shady cover and outdoor furniture. I love hearing the natural spring sound in the background. A previous time we had used the boat on the pond and it made for a special intimate conversation and togetherness. Also loved the little porch area with the grill just outside the kitchen. Made for nice steaks.
The cabin was very comfortable and we slept so well we got up almost late.
Wanting to stay away from the city I cooked a lot and found a kitchen well stocked with pots, pans and utensils. The upstairs room is adorable under the gable. I could not resist sitting on the genuine era rope bed...and would have loved to sleep on it!
We were very thankful for Mary Pat's kindness to allow us to make use of a little more time as no guest were arriving that same day. She was excellent with communication by the way!
I hope I get to come back during the winter to stay put the whole time with chestnuts roasting in the fire..."

Cabin 2 has a walkway directly to the dock and a decent view onto the pond, which was convenient for watching kids out in the boat while making dinner. Lots of nature, friendly animals and friendly hosts. Although there is only 1 bathroom, it is setup so that more than one person can be showering or getting ready at the same time and still have privacy. Good fishing in the pond. There was a row boat available to use as well."

HVAC works like a dream. No TV needed when you could be watching a camp fire.
The beds are clean and cozy. Two very workable places to set up your computer and work if needed.

What makes this a wonderful family experience, however, is the presence of farm animals and a private pond, complete with fishing dock and small boats that children can handle on their own. Located in a truly rural setting, the site is completely quiet, with stars at night and roosters in the morning. Mary Pat even provides eggs from her hens. A wonderful retreat from the world."

The only thing that would've made it more perfect is an upstairs toilet. I say that because of the stairs and our age. We're senior adults. But that's not a show stopper. I'd still book it again. Thanks for sharing it with us. We rested well.

Stayed about a week","This was a nice private place on a creek that finally flowed after the hurricane came through, although that was not the reason I stayed there. The main living area is a bit awkward as the loveseat/ couch is under the tv so you can’t watch it unless you sit on the barstools across from it at an eating bar. That was almost completely taken up by my cosmetics/ hygiene products as there is no room in the bathroom to put anything. I know that there was nothing in the kitchen that I was not aware of as I was not cooking there anyway, but there was only 1 can light in the kitchen, no under cabinet or over the sink lighting. When the sun was up in the morning, the light was ok but we had some cloudy days and it was very difficult to read anything. The satellite was out for the first couple of days I was there but could get on the internet.
The bed was super comfortable but I guess I did not pay attention when I booked it as there was only 1 bathroom and had to negotiate some steep steps"

Stayed with a pet","Had a great time. The hosts were very helpful and accommodating. The place is very cute, and the setting is amazing. Everything you need to cook is available, the bed is very comfortable. The place is well priced.
Two things to be aware of, these are not at all complaints just two things I thought would be useful to know, they did not inhibit my stay at all.
The main house shares a driveway with the rental home so they are closer than I expected. The rental faces the river and the view is amazing, you will not see the main house when you are looking towards the river but it is nearby.
There are other dogs on the property that walk around unleashed, they are very sweet! I brought my German Shepherd who is a little wary of other dogs so that was an adjustment for him but the other dogs were great. Just a heads up for any other dog owners with anxious puppies. Other than that my dog had a blast climbing around the river and sniffing in the woods. I would stay again anytime."

Stayed with kids","Anytime I booked a stay, first thing I read are the reviews for the location & places I’m looking to stay in. I couldn’t have been more blessed/thankful to find this cabin. I was taking this spring break week as a much needed get away, bonus it was also my birthday week. The reviews & the view of the creek flowing, sold me on my decision. Kayla & Joel are amazing, extremely friendly hosts, plus the doggies! Their hospitality was impressive & definitely appreciated! The cabin is super cute, the location is close to many things I had planned to do. Sitting out on the patio, listening to the creek, sipping coffee in the morning & reading a book was the most peaceful, beautiful, relaxing atmosphere & just what my soul needed, or wine in the evening. Joel even took time out of his schedule to make sure my 15 year old son was able to catch some fish, beings as that was his goal on the trip. We had an fantastic time & I’d highly recommend for a small family or a couples retreat! Will be back!"

Not only did we have everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay, we had the most amazing view to enjoy while we were there! We spent hours just sitting on the deck and watching the water, and slept with the windows open, so we could hear the water outside. Hosts Joel and Kayla were so friendly and helpful! They made sure that our experience was top-notch. The cabin was clean, well-appointed, and very comfortable. We enjoyed every minute, and can't wait to visit again."

Being able to be only feet away from the water and fishing near the banks of the property line was another amazing part of the trip.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at the cozy cabin for almost a week in October 2021.
We throroughly enjoyed our stay. We relaxed each evening on the Patio watching and listening to the creek.
We also spent a few evenings by the firepit. Very relaxing!
The creek was pretty high at the time and quite loud! It calmed down after a few days.
We hiked several places in the area: Sprewell Bluff, Pine Mountain and High Falls.
The weather was perfect for hiking in shorts!
The cabin is pet friendly and the owners have a couple of adorable Doodles who visited us often. They were quite friendly.
We looked forward to being 'Doodled' in the morning and evening.
We brought our little 15lb Rat Terrier Buddy and he enjoyed the property and loved the hiking too!
The cabin was very clean and just as pictured! The kitchen is well stocked. Do not be afraid of the 'hot plate' -
it is actually a nice two burner cook top!
While there is no free standing range/oven, there is a nice toaster oven/air fryer and a large microwave.
We didn't have any trouble cooking any meals!
The cabin was quite well stocked too. I usually will bring extra paper towels/toilet paper/trash bags - but all were present and plentiful.
I read a review that someone said that the water smelled funny - I would agree - but it reminded me of the sulfur smell that is common from a well.
I didn't ask if the cabin had city water/sewer like I do in town - I just assumed it had well/septic.
I did brush my teeth and showered from the tap water, and I'm alive and well! LOL!
We did opt to get some bottled water in town for coffee/tea/drinking.
The owners were lovely to work with and we had no issues with anything at all.
We totally enjoyed the stay and hope to return next year for more hiking."

The cottage was clean, well kept, and so cozy. You can hear the creek by merely opening the windows and even more so by sitting out on the porch. My family and I were able to explore the creek, swim, and fish. Sprewell Bluff was just 10 minutes away. You can hike, swim, fish, canoe/kayak, and tube.
Kayla and Joel were very kind, attentive, responsive, and quick to help with any difficulty.

Stayed a few nights","Had a little trouble finding it due to the way the neighborhood is set up. The house is down a long driveway and sits behind the house facing the road. Was a little confusing but host help get us there. Host was helpful when I mistakenly locked the door knob along with the remote lock. Had someone come unlock and get is inside within reasonable time. We had an issue with yellow jackets being in the house each night. Most were dying as they entered but obviously there is an infestation somewhere. The host did ask me if we noticed any but only after our stay and after I stepped on a live one and got stung. Hopefully this will be corrected. Otherwise our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. There were plenty of towels, linens and toiletries. Only thing I would suggest is a bigger trash can for the kitchen. The one there was the size for a bathroom. We were there on business so there wasn’t a lot of leisure time spent at the house, but it would be nice if you’re looking for a quiet stay."

We left very early the next morning and were grateful for the grab and go breakfast items that had been provided in the lounge area.

Roger goes above and beyond. There are not many places to stay in Thomaston. Many of my colleagues stayed out of town and were at a disadvantage with the heavy rain from a tropical storm. But since Miss Annie's is so conveniently located, I was safely off the road in less than 10 minutes and pleasantly surprised to be walked in by Roger with an umbrella. Quiet, private, and so much interesting history here. I highly recommend staying here."

The attention to detail like hot tea, coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt and water were welcome touches for this weary traveler. I can’t rave enough how welcomed and comfortable I felt. Truly, a home away from home experience. My only regret is I couldn’t stay longer."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I are SO thankful we found Ms. Annie's Guest House, because we did NOT want to stay in the hotels in Thomaston.
The house is so, so gorgeous and charming. Upon our arrival, Roger came out to our car and greeted us, and helped us with our bags! He explained everything to know about our room and the lounge and our stay overall, and our conversations with him were always so sweet and enjoyable! We told him one of my friends just had a baby with a couple complications, and he asked how the baby and the mama were doing, which was so considerate and very appreciated by us. He also asked us what our favorite yogurt is, and he was sure to stock it in the mini-fridge for us, which was so special, and such a kind gesture. He gave us a sweet card and a gift on the last night of our stay, and it made my heart melt! There were so many thoughtful touches, and we were so thankful that Roger cared so much about making us feel right at home!!
We stayed in the Garden Room, which was so cozy and beautiful. The pillows, sheets, mattress, and bath towels were all so soft and plush!! The bath towels were 100% Egyptian cotton, so we knew Roger desires the best for his customers!!
We were always so excited to come back to the house, because we knew we had a warm, cozy bed to sleep in, and it felt just like we were in our home away from home.
Roger, we can't thank you enough for all you did to make our stay the best stay possible!! Ms. Annie's is a gem in Thomaston, and if you're not staying here, you're missing out BIG TIME."

Stayed one night","There are so many wonderful things I can say about Ms. Annie’s Garden Room in Thomaston! The first thing is the graciousness of host Roger. He greeted me and was a wonderful conversationalist as he gave me so many insightful insights into (interesting) Thomaston and Upson County. Beyond that, the whole arrangement there in his lovely home is simply everything a traveler could ask for. Lovely. Restful. Historic. Spic-and-span clean. Comfortable. Like home. So much like being at home. So many nice touches. Location is central to town (within easy walking distance to the city center). There’s much to love about Roger’s place – a historic place that’s tied up in the history of the county’s most historically significant family. When I go back to that part of Georgia, I emphatically hope to stay there again. Thank you, Roger!"

If you like to hike, kayak, or tube, checkout Spreebluff State Park, a short twenty minute drive that will not disappoint. The grounds and gardens around the home provide ample opportunity for relaxing and romantic strolls. Lest I forget, the dark, hardwood floors, doors, and molding create an atmosphere that transports visitors to another era."

I was escaping hurricane Irma, and Roger let me check in early because I had driven a long way through traffic and got there sooner than expected. He also let me check out a day early as I was driving back to make sure my home was in one piece. He even packed me a sandwich and a muffin for the long ride. Roger is definitely a southern gentleman through and through!
The bed was so comfy and the house is nice and quiet, so I slept like a log my whole stay. I loved the upstairs parlor as a nice little common area to escape my room while there. The location is perfect and I urge everyone to take advantage of his suggestions for experiencing local Thomaston. Make sure you get to meet his two rescue dogs as well!"

The place had plenty of space for us & kept us warm on those cold nights. It was very clean and stocked with essentials. Jared responded quickly to any question I had. Will definitely stay again.

Really nice location, friendly host and excellent communication. very understanding and respectful; had to change dates on my reservation and they didn’t drag it out, response time was very quickly. Our guess was very pleased with how clean the home was. Easy to access, just be aware there is no signal at the location. Everything went very smooth!! Thank you, we‘ll def consider this place again!

Stayed a few nights","Jared’s location was EXACTLY what my family was looking for! It is a great spot on the Flint River and has its own little private island that we could fish and kayak off of. We loved drinking our coffee on the front porch looking out at the River. The house is very open with a large kitchen and living area, the bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the AC worked great! We loved it so much that we are planning to come back next year!!
I grew up in a rural area, so I’m used to bugs, snakes, GA red clay and absolutely NO cell service! So if you are city folk and expect something pristine with high speed internet, this may not be the place for you.
I almost don’t want to give such a good review because when I come back, it may be fully booked! But if you’re looking for somewhere to get off the grid and enjoy the River, this is a great place to stay."

We grilled out back, and then walked across the bridge to relax and just watch the water flow. The internet is super slow though! But who needs the internet when your relaxing. There was no cellular service for us and we had to connect to the Wi-Fi to make calls. Otherwise it was awesome and relaxing. A little on the high end per night for just a couple, but great value if it’s more people!"

Unfortunately, it was not clean as you would expect when arriving for a night. Cleanliness is a big factor for us, and even my kids noticed and were hesitant to get into the beds.
What made matters worse on this particular night was that there was no wifi. In the middle of nowhere with no service, we couldn’t even communicate with the owners our issues.
Place has potential, but wasn’t ready for us."

Stayed one night","We travel alot, sometimes twice a month. So we're getting accustomed to Airbnb stays. The day of our stay i found it odd we didn't get a email from the host with check in information. Good thing Airbnb message had the address after receiving payment in full. We arrived at the home and checked email, but still no email from the host. I tried to email to get lockbox info but there was no cellphone service reception in this area. I tried to get a signal but nothing. My wife couldn't get a signal either. So we drove 2 miles away to get a signal. Once we got the signal we emailed for the lockbox info. Once we get that, we drove back to the house, get inside and then there's no power. We drove back 2miles down the road to email. She said it was storms that knocked out power and someone was coming to fix it. Understandable because it was heavy storms that week. I told her i can't message her with no service but she said when power come on wifi should work. We went back to the house and sat outside waiting for restoration of power. We ate on front porch. When it got darker we went inside and waited. Power came up around 8pm that night but wifi never came up so I couldn't reach out to host. What was very uncomfortable is all the large front windows and glass door. No coverage for windows so people could look into the dark nights there. My wife didn't want to go out to kitchen at night because how exposed it was. Bedrooms have blinds but not livingroom. The next morning still no wifi. Satellite TV finally came up but by then we had enough. We cleaned up and left around 8am. We drove to town and messaged that we left and was heading home. The only response seemed more like they weren't being empathetic about our situation and responding about showing up at their pizzeria they owned in town and getting a appetizer. I was disappointed because despite the circumstances I didn't blame them but empathetic at the moment wouldn't went a long way. I didn't want to write a review but I decided to after all and hope moving forward communication emails and feedback would be better. As a final note, it's a nice place with a nice view. You may have cellphone service issues but that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying peace."

Stayed with kids","Paulette's cabin was a dream. We were just passing through and stayed just a night, but is was such a fun experience. My little boys loved running around the farm when we arrived, and I so enjoyed watching the animals and the sun set before we turned in to our cozy stay in the primitive cabin. We have been reading through Little House on the Prairie series, and it felt like the perfect place to stay for my boys to experience a little bit what it may have been like for Laura (but with ac, electricity and running water lol). Both Forsyth and Barnsville were charming little towns that had several options to eat and walk around. And Paulette was such a gracious host. She obviously has put in years and all of her heart to cultivating her beautiful farm."

Since we were there for a weekend event in Zebulon/Concord, we didn't have much time to explore the expansive ranch -- we'll just have to come back!"

Everything was better than even the listing or photos showed. Plenty of amenities, and modern features in a roar c setting. It was like taking a step back in time, but with a/c and indoor plumbing.
Loved the turkey and the baby kittens.

We would stay there again if we were passing through."

The cabin sits on a beautiful ranch, where you can enjoy watching a diverse range of farm animals, including goats, cows, turkeys, and horses.
The cabin itself is clean, functional, and decorated with local antiques. It is rustic yet cozy, and conveys a sense of what life was like ""way back then.""
The surrounding areas are hilly, with dense forests and small, welcoming towns interspersed throughout.
I highly recommend Paulette's Place to anyone looking to connect with nature and discover the daily rhythms of life on a Georgia ranch."

The guesthouse is welcoming, comfortable, and clean. Their farm is amazing, and you can roam around it as you please.

We felt they were safe in the yard on the playground and felt very comfortable with them around the animals. We enjoyed the private, peaceful surroundings away from other people. The house is decorated very interesting, very similar to my parents' house, so it was familiar to my children. Lighting in the bathroom was a little dim for getting ready to attend a wedding. The kitchen was a little crowded for when cooking as there is no counter. It would be helpful to have some space to sit other personal belongings or shelves or hooks to hang them on. We did make use of the cook top, toaster oven, and high chair. Hostess was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Overall, we enjoyed our visit, definitely would recommend over a hotel and would book again when passing through the area."

If you want a luxurious stay, this isn't it. It's rustic as the description says. However, the Guest House had everything we needed and it was something we will never forget. The turkey that followed us everywhere like a dog, the gorgeous farm, the tame little lambs, the sweet cattle dog. I would liken it to staying overnight in a museum or antique store. Very interesting! And Paulette was a wonderful host. Great information and very timely."

Lambs played in the backyard as the turkeys wandered in the front. The sunrise is true beauty at its finest and Ms. Paulette's granddaughters are an absolute delight!

There is only a very small microwave, and two portable electric burners, and only one frying pan and a small refrigerator. No freezer.
If you plan to cook, bring your own cooking pot, but I am sure Paulette would have provided one had I asked.

Stayed one night","If you love farms and antiques, you'll love this place! This was the most convenient place for us to stop on our trip overnight, but I didn't get to feel all the charm until the next morning. We didn't get in till after dark, and that made it a little more difficult to find, but it was very comfortable and very quiet. We weren't there long enough to eat or use anything other than the restroom, so I can't comment on any of that. Seeing all the animals the next morning on the working farm reminded me of my childhood. Paulette was so sweet and I loved chatting with her that morning. If I had the chance to do this alone without my two teenagers, it would have been amazing. Thank you Paulette!"

Plenty of beds to sleep in upstairs. We will definitely be back. A much needed romantic, restful getaway for two southern city folks. We haven’t gotten this much one on one time and solid sleep in months. We loved it here."

The guest house was so warm and inviting and feels like a big hug taking you back in time to simpler times. Mom & I opted for the 2 twin beds which were very comfortable. Outside is full of wonderful surprises and picture perfect moments around every corner. The farm animals are adorable and give a glimpse of a life we’ve always wondered about. They have the absolute best welcoming committee....2 of the most lovable dogs we’ve ever met. Endless games of fetch and hugs are guaranteed. Planning a return visit already."

The host is responsive and has everything you could need should you forget something.
The area was flawless and well laid out. A few things that stood out to us: the mattress heaters 10/10 and we will be ordering our own. Also the robes were delightful after taking a shower.

Stayed a few nights","I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The name Serenity Carriage House is aptly applied to this place.
With some places it is very clear the instant that you walk in that the host spent a lot of time thinking about setting up the space to make the guests comfortable. This was one of them. There were so many little touches in every room that it was obvious that she wanted to provide a top notch experience for the guests.
One such touch was the bath robes that were very nice to have when you got out of the shower since it was cold outside. But that was just one of many.
The place was spotless and very comfortable with every amenity a traveler would need. I honestly can't say enough nice things about it. There were some excellent food choices less than 10 minutes away in Zebulon.
If/when I come back to the area - I will definitely stay here again without considering anywhere else. Stay here - you will be happy you did."

Bathroom was huge, in fact, the entire place was larger than anticipated and delightfully decorated. No expense has been spared with the cottage. I would encourage anyone looking at this place, to go and see for yourself. We are glad we did. The only drawback, no eating place close that we found, it is several miles to a restaurant, so take snacks to get you by or stop at the Dollar General Store on the way in. EXCELLENT!"

Subdued lighting in bedroom (I hate LED bulbs in nightstand lamps!), plus a reading light attached to each side of bed headboard so one person could read while the other slept.

And this is exactly what we found at the carriage house! It was a wonderful week. Decor was cute. Bed was super comfortable. No carpet, no smoking, and no pets made it feel and smell really clean. We cooked our own breakfast at the house. My wife had just got her motorcycle and we wanted to ride at slow speeds with straight roads, we would ride out for lunch at local restaurants in several neighboring towns and then come back for a nap. The shower was perfect for relaxing after our rides. Warmer weather than the mountains and no crowds like the beach during spring break. After supper we would lay in bed and watch TV."

She had a bottle of wine and SNACKS! She catered to all. She even had gluten free options AND Dark chocolate, thank you! The bedroom was spacious and bed comfortable. It was handy to have a washer and dryer, if needed.
I am VERY grateful that I was not ""hit with a curtain"" of Plug In odor! Those are often to smelly.
It was an amazing visit and I hope to be able to return!"

Stayed with kids",I’ve stayed at multiple Airbnb locations and this was by far the best one I’ve ever stayed at. It was cute it was clean the location and offered every single thing that we needed. The host responds immediately and is very accommodating. Its perfect if you need to also work and it’s far superior to any hotel room that you could possibly rent. We will definitely be staying here again in the near future.

Stayed with kids","Susan’s place was truly a retreat! With the tranquil music, calming scents and bathrobes. The bed was a California king and extremely comfortable. The place was immaculate, cozy, and well equipped. We enjoyed the short drive to 1828 Coffee Co. Griffin was about a 20 minute drive but had plenty of restaurants. Susan was very nice and accommodating. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay with Susan was absolutely wonderful! We were in the area to watch our kiddo in a team competition & we wish we'd had more downtime to spend at the house. So many thoughtful, extra touches made our stay beyond comfortable. Wine, bottled water, coffee & snacks all greeted us upon our arrival inside the house. Keyless entry made check-in easy and the place was a super clean, updated and well appointed. The communication with Susan was excellent & checkout was also a breeze. We look forward to returning again in the future. Truly an exceptional place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","10 STARS ⭐️
We had a family wedding @ Whiskey Bonding Barn which is 7-8 miles down the road from Susan’s Airbnb it was absolutely perfect! The location was ideal for our trip- but Susan’s space is SOOO thought out & covers any need you may have for a wknd getaway. We thoroughly enjoyed the coziness, cleanliness, all the thought out details that truly make you right @ home. I love how efficient the lay out is, her decor, the bada** shower, soft music that is playing as you walk into the front door, & we had a sweet little cat friend(we named her Harriet) who hung out with us out on the patio.
Totally recommend staying here & know you won’t be disappointed at all. Thank you Susan"

We were just looking for a last minute getaway and this was a fun find! The town is tiny, but that suited us fine. There is one restaurant but we did not try it. There are larger towns with more restaurants and shopping and other activities 10+ miles away. Concord is very flat so we were able to ride our bikes. We went to Greggs Farms and bought fresh peaches and ate their yummy peach ice cream. Susan was kind enough to send me something that I left there. Thanks for a great weekend!"

Stayed a few nights","My experience at Serendipity was everything I read and so much more. The description does not mention listening to the beautiful music of birds singing while enjoying morning coffee on the patio. Or the spa like shower experience that is so refreshing. More importantly the peacefulness and tranquility that surrounds you each time you enter the carriage house.
As others mentioned the space is extremely clean, well thought-out and many extras not normally available in an Airbnb.
I would highly recommend and hope to visit again."

Stayed with kids","I really can't say enough about this stay. It is exactly as it looks in the pictures, and the description is accurate. The whole cottage is very well appointed. Everything we could have needed was in the kitchen, including some nice extras like ziplock bags that we needed in a pinch. She provided all necessary toiletries, and again extras like q-tips, makeup wipes, and bathrobes. There is a VERY large closet type area at the back entrance where we had all the room we needed to put luggage and hanging clothes. There was a really thoughtful basket of snacks that we were very excited about. She provided hot chocolate, a TON of teas to choose from, and very nice coffee options if you are a coffee person. The king bed was so, so comfortable and the sheets are soft and smooth! There was plenty of space in the bedroom for my son's pack and play. Access to the bathroom is NOT through the bedroom, so you won't disturb anyone who wants to go to bed early! All of the doors are sliding barn doors, so they do not seal or lock. Just something to keep in mind in case that's important to you. It is a little bit of a drive to get to the surrounding attractions, so make sure you know how far you will be driving. I personally prefer a bit of a drive and a very nice place to stay over a convenient distance and substandard accomodations.The only other thing I want to note is that if there is a truck parked in the driveway in front of the camper, then there isn't a very wide clearance for luggage. Just make sure not to hit the truck! I am already trying to figure out when I might be able to come back and bring my husband, because he would LOVE this place! It really is a fantastic value!"

She had a basket with a good variety of snacks that was just what we needed after a long day of travel. She even placed a couple bottles of water & a couple of cokes in the fridge for us. She had the cutest little bottles of shampoo & conditioner. The water pressure in the shower was great. The bed linens were so nice and soft . The mattress was extremely comfortable and we slept so well. The coffee station was on point. I would definitely stay at this cottage again."
