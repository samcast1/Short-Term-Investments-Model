Joel and Matthew were the friendliest hosts we ever met. It was an impeccable place from the inside to the outside. The backyard was a peaceful oasis with a pond and waterfall. We will stay here again when we come to town. We have recommended this gorgeous place to our local family as well and they will pass the word on to their friends and faculty when they have out of town guests."

Stayed a few nights","From the time of our booking, through our stay and until checkout, both Joel & Matthew were professional, outgoing and always willing to assist my spouse and I. Prior to arrival, I realized that we needed to make an adjustment to our reservation of which they understood and promptly approved. Prior to arrival, we were provided with very thorough checkin guidance. Upon arrival, Joel saw my spouse unloading our luggage and without hesitation, assisted, engaged in conversation and informed us of festivities for the night. Over the course of our stay, we met both Joel & Matthew’s Mothers as well as extended family. They were filled with warmth and very outgoing as well. The Airbnb is cozy, felt like a home away from home, stocked with everything you need if you would like to cook. The bed slept so good, one day we skipped out on our prearranged plans and just slept in. The shower/bath is great with awesome water pressure and temperature. We truly felt at home. Thanks Joel & Matthew."

Stayed one night","We booked this spot last-minute & the hosts were fantastic at responding quickly and were very communicative. I'm SO GLAD we stayed here! It was exactly as described. Very clean & super comfortable. They had everything we needed to make our morning tea-the kitchen is a great space. The bed was comfy, the furniture was nice & the small space didn't feel cluttered at all. It's even nicer than the photos! The back shared patio is beautiful & the pond will be a masterpiece when finished (it's totally enjoyable already!) The neighborhood is so so cute, with tons of historic homes. It was very quiet (they are close to train tracks, & we did hear one train probably around 8 pm. They provide ear plugs if you need it). We used the historic home walking tour map & made our way around their neighborhood the next morning. It was a very safe spot & it was beautiful & quaint-I would totally stay here again. A decent hotel room is the same cost and this place is a million times better!"

I appreciated access to laundry.
The backyard is going to be an oasis once it's finished!
I can see this property becoming quite the neighborhood gem once they've completed the backyard!
Highly recommended."

Stayed one night","Where to even start? If I could give Joel, Matthew, and their carriage house accommodation 10 stars, it still would not be enough. First of all, as soon as we arrived, Joel came out to help us with our luggage. Once upstairs, he showed us around and answered any questions. The carriage house was so well-appointed and had so many extras (wine in refrigerator, packs of instant oatmeal and soups). The place was spotless, expertly designed and decorated. We joined Joel and Matthew for wine and conversation outside and have just never had an Airbnb experience as delightful. Within an hour’s time, we felt as though we were old friends."

As you enter the backyard entrance, it feels like you're in a private island oasis .. absolutely beautiful work in progress. You can tell they take so much pride in their home, we LOVED all the creative & festive decorations. 🎃👻 Had absolutely everything we needed. Location is PERFECT for anywhere you need to go & they gave EXCELLENT recommendations for food & fun.

You really can tell the owners care about their surroundings and the people they meet. The place was very clean and decorated tastefully. Also, there was the cutest little ghost in the bathroom on the toilet who greeted you with funny sayings. I got a kick out of it. I absolutely loved the design. Each time I looked around, I discovered something unique. The bed was amazing!!! I slept so well. These hosts are so thoughtful and gracious. I would definitely recommend this place to others.

Stayed a few nights","I cannot adequately express how very much we enjoyed staying in this wonderful place!
We were in dire need of some comfortable and peaceful R&R and this beautiful and luxurious carriage house checked EVERY box...plus some we'd never have expected. It was a cool oasis away from some pretty intense Mississippi summer heat. It was cozy and spacious with plenty of room to relax and watch some TV on the amazing large screened television. The kitchen was far more than adequate and fully equipped. Finally, I must mention THE BED! It was FABULOUS; adjustable and just the right hybrid of soft yet firm with very soft bedding. We slept better than we even do in our own home!
It was, hands down, one of our top 3 Airbnb stays EVER!
Thank you gentlemen for your warm hospitality and attention to even the smallest detail to make your guests stay a pleasant...and memorable one!"

Stayed one night","This place was absolutely perfect for us. My sister and I stayed 1 night here after seeing a comedy show at the Saenger in downtown. The location was great. Safe, quiet neighborhood, but also very close to downtown area. Joel and Matthew were EXCELLENT hosts. They had wine waiting in our room, lots of coffee/creamer which is huge for me, and the place was simply gorgeous. It’s just like the pictures. The bed was so soft and everything was squeaky clean! They made us cookies and were such a pleasure to be around. They have exciting plans for their home and Airbnb and we hope to come back one day and see it all come to life."

Stayed one night","We loved every minute of our day. We arrived very late night and I wish we coulda got there sooner to enjoy it longer!!! Joel and Matthew’s place is absolutely gorgeous. Every single detail. Though I didn’t get to enjoy the complementary wine this time with being pregnant, I enjoyed some snacks and lots of water! The robes added a nice touch, the bed was so very comfortable, everything was squeaky clean, 10/10 recommend and will 100% be back. We loved the area so much! And the concept of the garage with lofted apartment above it is awesome and we will most definitely be utilizing this idea on the new acreage we just bought to live in while we build the main quarters. Also visited south bound bagels after departing our day and it was a MUST. Looking forward to coming back."

Stayed a few nights","There really should be a special category for hosts like Joel and Matthew, and property like their beautiful Carriage House. From the clear and easy to follow instructions to the top-quality ammenities, this was easily the best Airbnb we've stayed at in the eight years/20 times we've used Airbnb.
We arrived after dark to lights on in the apartment and the air conditioning on. There were baskets of snacks on the counter and cold bottles of water in the fridge. And I can't believe I'm going to mention this - but the toilet paper was the good kind (not the cheap stuff usually provided at other places)! Wooden clothes hangers, shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower, thick and fluffy towels, plush robes, soft bed sheets...it's evident these hosts want the best for their guests and are willing to spend the extra money to make them feel special. And we did.
BOOK THIS CARRIAGE HOUSE! You will love every moment of your stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Joel and Matthew are so hospitable and friendly! They thought of everything! There were fresh bottles of water in the frig when we arrived, fresh fruit, snacks, oatmeal for breakfast in case we had not shopped... and a bottle of white and a bottle of red wine awaited on the counter! The linens were clean and crisp, in a most comfortable king size adjustable bed with comfortable pillows. The towels were fresh and clean and they included bath robes! We were so pleasantly surprised at all the details that were thoughtfully considered. They offered to bring us breakfast. They brought us dessert. One night we socialized on their patio and had a blast! Our experience was one of luxury in a homey, beautiful space perched high on the 2nd floor of their detached garage; it was as if we were in a finely decorated tree house! When you open the door this lovely space filled with amenities awaits you! They respect your privacy and it is up to you if you choose interaction...just a great experience!"

Stayed about a week","Joel & Matthew are phenomenal hosts. They have created an amazing boutique hotel experience in a beautiful studio space. The bed is comfortable, the towels and linens are finest quality, the amenities provide a home-away-from-home experience, and the design of the space is flawless. The outdoor area is as comfortable and inviting as the Carriage House itself and they continue to make improvements. Inside, there is a beautiful view in each direction and you're at tree top level providing the best of scenery. Joel & Matthew went out of their way to make sure my stay was comfortable and memorable, giving me tips and directions on how to navigate my way around Hattiesburg. They made great suggestions as far as dining and shopping, and the Carriage House is within walking distance of a beautiful park, the historic downtown, and just a stroll from beautiful home after beautiful home (including their own). It's truly a relaxing and unforgettable experience at a price that can't be matched."

We were very comfortable throughout our stay- we loved the soft bedsheets, plush towels, and the couch was so comfortable we could have slept there too! It was great to see that both bedrooms had ceiling fans and the blackout curtains and nightstands with outlets/charging ports were a great touch.
The entire unit was immaculately clean and we appreciated having a kitchen with a dining area. The water pressure in the shower is great and having the ability to wash clothes in the unit was a bonus.
We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone!"

It was in a convenient location. We were able to walk to the zoo and Uber to a nearby brewery.
We would definitely stay here again!"

A major plus for us was the proximity (walking distance) to Equinox, one of our favorite coffee shops in Hattiesburg. The place felt very clean, and I enjoyed the lack clutter. Made it easy to tell the place was clean and easy to keep up with our own things. The kitchen and large tv were especially nice. We do wish there had been a small table in the kitchen. Kids loved playing in the yard."

When encountering any issues or questions (which there were little to none) they were resolved in a fast manner and perfectly at that. Access to the apartment is easy to remember and understand and the directions listed were easy to follow as well. The surrounding area is beautiful, quiet and had a lot of places to go even within 15 minutes in any direction. We would love to stay here again if we ever were to be in the area!

I did not make use of the front porch and chairs, but they're there if you want them. And there's plenty of parking space right i n front of the house. Amber provides a Keurig with coffee and bottles of water (which you really need to constantly carry in the Mississippi heat) and bags of popcorn to enjoy while watching TV. Amber's place is one of the better airbnb's out there, and as a first-time visitor to the South, I was delighted by her Southern hospitality. Don't hesitate to book this place. It's clean, quiet, comfortable, and Amber is an excellent hostess."

Stayed with a pet","This Tiny House is truly an Oasis. It felt like it was very rural, but it was only a few minutes from everything Hattiesburg has to offer, many restaurants and shopping. It was quiet and very clean. Even though it’s a tiny house, it felt very spacious. All of the furniture was placed in a layout that the space feels maximized. The shower heated up very fast and had great water pressure. The bed is very comfortable. Very eclectic and had a record player that we cranked up. There is a tv in the living room and the bedroom. There is even an area completely fenced in for your pup and a small fire pit. Washer and dryer in the unit. Full size refrigerator and dishwasher. There was a coffee selection and snacks. Hosts were fantastic and friendly and very responsive. We come to H’burg often and will be booking this property in the future."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this 1948 vintage camper. Lauren was a great host, very quick to communicate and respond to questions. We were concerned about an issue with our car battery and Lauren arranged for someone to be there in the morning to jump it if our car didn't start. The camper was clean and had everything necessary for a couple of nights including a powerful air conditioner. There isn't a burner for cooking (for boiling water) but this wasn't an issue for us since the mini oven has multiple functions. It was peaceful sitting on the front porch in the wooded setting where we enjoying coffee in the morning and wine at night. The location is great being near the highway yet not too noisy. Fantastic little place for us to relax between our travel from TN to FL. Very good value as well."

Keep in mind that it’s a camper, so the shower is small and not for tall folks. Didn’t bother us any for a short stay. We will definitely be back!"

Maybe a heater in the bathroom. With door shut it was freezing in there.
Maybe steps up to the camper from the driveway, especially since it did rain.
Overall I would stay again, the price is great and it’s a cute idea.

It’s roughly 10-15 mins to an area with lots of restaurants & things to do.

My 17-month-old enjoyed being able to run around the well-maintained backyard after a long day of driving. From snacks, coffee, a welcome note with wine, and games galore - there were so many special touches that made us feel special. When we come back to Hattiesburg, Chae’s place is certainly first on our list of places to stay. Thank you for having us!"

Stayed over a week","I arrived at night and there were no exterior lights (a motion sensor light would have worked). I had to use my camera flashlight to see the keypad. On February 2nd I bought this to the attention of the host or cohost and was told she’d get right on it. I checked out on February 29th and nothing was done.
I had questions about a garage door opener and the remote to the fireplace and was told they’d look into it but never received a response. I was there 40 nights.
The TV wasn’t set up properly for guest mode. I was on the phone back and forth and was assured that the code worked. It did not. I finally asked if someone could come over to help. The next day someone came by and realized that the code didn’t work.
The house is very lovely but the sofa is lumpy and is practically on the floor. If you’re an adult, you’ll struggle standing up.
The guest bathroom tub drains very slowly so you’re standing in water as you shower.
Otherwise, it’s a beautiful home in a nice neighborhood.."

Group trip","We were in H’burg for our son’s wedding, & Chae’s home provided the quiet, relaxing environment we needed after 3 long days of festivities! The home was located in quiet, peaceful neighborhood, not far from DT, which made it rather easy to run into town & the venue if we needed anything. The home was spacious, charming & stylish yet cozy & inviting, the pictures didn’t do it justice. We only had one little “oops” during our stay. As we all know things happen when you least expect them. When we arrived we realized we couldn’t get into the home. I immediately called Chae & she made some phone calls & found out that her housekeeper had been involved in a car wreck, therefore the home had not been cleaned. Chae immediately sprung into action, she & her team managed to clean the entire home while we were out to dinner with our family! By the time we got back the home was clean & ready for us to enjoy!! Chae was responsive, & made sure we had a great experience! Def would book again!"

Group trip","The house was very comfortable and well appointed. It’s location is perfect- 3/4 of a mile from Hardy Street but in a quiet neighborhood. I had packed Tide pods and unstoppables just in case I needed to wash clothes and Chae had plenty of both already in the house, which is unusual (most places leave a couple pods and that’s it). Chae has been quick to respond on all communication so I would imagine she would be quick to fix any problems that may arise for a guest. We had a wonderful trip and will definitely stay here again should we need to stay in Hattiesburg!"

Great lighting in home due to OPTIONS: multiple windows, overhead lighting in addition to lamps, and even dim lighting options in master bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.
Mattresses were firm which happens to be my preference. I loved having a vanity setup in bedroom for makeup.

Stayed with a pet","We were excited to stay to celebrate my daughter's Southern Miss graduation, and Lee's gorgeous home was beyond perfect! Our family of 5 , plus a dog had plenty or room and it was really just a slice of heaven. We relaxed by the creek, had coffee each morning on one of the decks overlooking the water, did some fishing, and even thought about kayaking, but ran out of time. My kids LOVED the record player- all three had never seen one and it was one of the coolest nights of our week, sitting around the living room room playing records and monopoly! :)
One of the nicest things about staying here is that Lee has thoughtfully provided so many things that made us feel right at home! From the coffee to the laundry, board games to the iron (we forgot ours) and even flashlights in case of power outages, we had everything we needed.
The house itself is decorated so nicely-pictures truly don't show it- towels/ linens were high quality, super soft.
Lee himself was wonderful! 5++ stars!"

All the basics like dish soap, dishwasher soap, laundry detergent, soap, shampoo, conditioner, basic seasonings were provided and made things so much easier. There were even storage containers for leftovers.
The only thing i didn't notice in the initial listing was around the stair height to the 2nd story, all the different surfaces outside, , and the slanted upstairs roof. We loved exploring all the little seating areas, bridges, and fire pits but my parents would not have been able to handle the stairs. The upstairs bathroom made the most of the space. Our 6' son had to watch for the slanted roof, but again the kids actually really enjoyed each having their own beds and spaces.
It was so peaceful to just enjoy our own little cottage with such great views of the water. If we're ever back in the area, we'll definitely go back."

I highly recommend this place. Our 3 day stay was very amazing. Everything was super clean and neat. The Christmas decorations that Mr Lee did were super welcoming that we felt right at home soon as we opened the door.

We will definitively go back in the summertime to enjoy the fireplaces, the river and different decks. We were all very sad to leave and we would have requested to stay longer if we didn't have other commitments.
The house is filled with everything you may need for a short or long stay. It was very clean, well decorated and everything works. You can tell after just few minutes in the place that Lee is taking very good care of his property.
We also appreciated the little fenced area on the side of the house so our dogs can play without being bothered by the other unleashed dogs from a nearby house.
We will be back! Maybe a new family Christmas tradition..."

Stayed with a pet","Lee's cottage was a wonderful weekend getaway for my wife and kids. We loved staying at the cottage as it was very clean with wonderful decor (and Christmas decorations inside/out for the holidays). The property is great with lots of spots for relaxing. Lee was very helpful, responsive, and friendly. We will definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","Wow, the photos don’t do Lee’s place justice! The view is incredible and peaceful with ample seating areas, rocking chairs, swings, two fire pits, heaters and fans on the porches. The cabin is beautifully decorated, while also having a masculine, rustic feel. The entire place is well appointed with everything you’ll need to cook and relax. It was spotless and the extra touches throughout the property were well thought out to make Lee’s guests as comfortable and happy as possible. It was the most welcoming AirBnb we’ve ever stayed in and we frequent many! We are locals and felt like we were on a vacation far away. We can not wait to take our children back for a family weekend. Highly recommend!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Hattiesburg was a pleasant surprise with its large number of good restaurants, coffee shops, name brand stores, two great golf courses and the Long Leaf Trace biking and walking trail! Chae's place, a lovely and well maintained property, was one of the few Airbnb's available in Hattiesburg that had two complete bathrooms in a three bedroom house. Two bathrooms are a requirement, since we usually have two senior couples when we travel! Chae's clean, open, uncluttered space with plenty of room to stow our stuff was much appreciated. The kitchen had what we needed, and the sun porch and back patio were lovelyT places to relax and visit! A couple of stools at the kitchen counter, a nightlight in the hall and a rug inside the front door would have been nice additions. Another concern we had upon arrival was the rusty derelict car which sits just off the curb in the empty lot across the street , an eyesore in an otherwise nice and peaceful neighborhood!"

There are a few things that need repairs, cleaning, or replacement but overall everything was just “ok.” The traffic outside is randomly loud at all hours so bring a sound machine so you can sleep. I wouldn’t recommend this place if you’re traveling with children, but would be alright for adults passing through. Couldn’t get a reply from the host over the course of several days asking the same question. Again, not the worst, not the best, just ok."

We were glad to have the coffee bar, many plugs with USB outlets, and luggage racks in each bedroom. The bathroom and beds are extremely clean, but the floor is not particularly clean.

The issues were immediately reported to the hosts and after many texts back and forth and wasted hours the issues were not addressed. In the end we were refunded half of our stay by the hosts, and the other half by AirBnB’s Air Cover.
Since many of the reviews have been favorable, maybe this was just a one-off. The host was apologetic and our hope for future renters is that things will be cleaner and the safety issues will be fixed."

Stayed with kids","Jerrod's place felt right at home. The house was the perfect size to accommodate our family of five. The check-in instructions were very clear and helpful. The kitchen was fully equipped with the essentials, and the beds were quite comfy. The home sits directly across the street from the major hospital, college campus, Walmart, and local shops. However, the bathroom was missing a bath rug along with a stepping stool for the little ones. The doors are missing door stops, so it's easy to accidentally damage the walls. The dishwasher is loose and not mounted firmly. Some of the furniture shows small signs of wear and tear, yet it's operational. Lastly, the house could also benefit from having a keyless entry for the front door. I was afraid that I might lose the house key while it was in my possession. In closing, my family and I truly enjoyed our visit. Thank you for having us."

Not only did she do a beautiful job cleaning, she was so nice and let us come in while she finished up. The house was just as it was pictured and Jarrod couldn't have been a better host. For dinner, we went to Ed's Burger Joint which was fun for us and our kids (10, 14, 15) with a lot of outside games to play in the perfect 75 degree weather."

Stayed with kids","This home was exceptional! This by far has been the best home we stayed in. The home was clean, smelled good, and was decorated very nice. The kitchen was fully equipped, literally every thing you need (even a cheese grater)! The bathroom was fully stocked, more than enough linens and wash towels. The host gave great instructions for everything in the home and was generous to have detergent and dryer sheets! the extra lighting fixtures in the rooms were great. the extra power cords on the side of the beds were great!
our only problems were that the heat/cool system defaulted to 50 at night and it was cold. also, the room with twin beds, needs blackout curtains because the street light illuminates the room at night. lastly, the blinds were broken on several of the windows, not really a big deal because there are curtains in every room."

Stayed with kids","This was a comfortable home. The location was very convenient we loved exploring downtown Hattiesburg. The house provided very comfortable accommodations, with very comfortably soft beds. There was full kitchen which was stocked with lots of necessary items, washer/dryer and huge TVs. It is very near a hospital, and I expected to hear a lot of sirens throughout the night, however, I did not hear any. The neighborhood felt safe."

We had a lovely stay in this adorable bungalow. It had everything we needed. Very clean with comfortable beds, spacious living area, and thoughtful touches, like luggage racks and a large hall tree for coats and bags.
The location is perfect. The decor is absolutely charming. Hosts were gracious and timely in their response.
We highly recommend staying here. We look forward to booking again in the future!"

Group trip","Katie’s farmhouse has a peace about it, I can’t put into words but if you need time to yourself or family or just time to reflect or map out your future goals/plans, well, this is the place. It has a home feeling about it. At first look, I was wondering if it had bugs or spiders being close to woodlands and trees but this was not the case at all. It was very clean and bug/rodent free lol. The kitchen was nice and well stocked with pots and pans for cooking, charcoal grill accessible with charcoal and lighter fluid. The shower and sink water pressure was outstanding as well as the heating and air conditioning. Absolutely no complaints and look forward to visiting just for the serenity and get away. Thanks for allowing our family to have quality time at your place Katie!
P.S. Katie’s response time to the one time I reached out at the end of my stay was immediately noted. TBH, I only reached out cause I am use to more of an exiting clause like, remove linens from beds that was used, placed used towels in or near washing machine and etc; but NO, Katie laughed and said that’s what the small cleaning fee is for."

Her porch is wonderful for watching the birds, all so peaceful. Highly recommend!

People here are very helpful and friendly. They eagerly gave recommendations of places to eat or shop. One of our favorites was Del Sol, a Mexican restaurant recommended by many. A+
This city has many colorful murals, which add to the charm of this place. The college campus is beautiful. It is a very clean city. It's easy to see that they take pride in their home town.
We took a 30 minute drive one day to Laurel (of HGTV fame) and enjoyed lunch at Cafe La Fleur. Again we saw murals and charming architecture.
We relish hunting for treasures at thrift shops and consignment stores. In between we delve into culture at an art gallery or museum. We were not disappointed.
All in all, this trip exceeded our expectations. Southern hospitality is alive and well!
Thank you Toni! ❤️"

Stayed one night","Oh, my goodness! Staying with Toni was a ""divine appointment""! First off, she is delightful and welcoming, so gracious and giving. Sweet touches---snacks, coffee, fresh flowers everywhere, bedside chocolate--were so heartwarming. It is IDEAL for a single traveler...and yet the space can easily accommodate a couple or a family--up to 8. I had a choice of bedrooms at the top of the stairs...there is a common lounge/relaxing area (TV, bookshelves, games, coffee) with a bathroom that serves two upstairs bedrooms. One is equipped for four (two queens) and the other for one or a couple (one queen). I chose the queen...and the bed/linens were literally dreamy. The interior/exterior are such a welcoming, comfortable, artistic space--I can't say enough wonderful things about it...but what was really priceless was hearing Toni's story and the reason for her provision. There is nowhere in the area you could stay to surpass it. Prov. 11:25 to Toni and Rev. 22:20 to all blessed to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The home was beautiful and immaculate. The backyard and lake were very scenic and would have been almost perfect if the hot tub had been working. It would also have been nice if the host was home as expected. I prefer not to stay in empty homes and was not informed the hot tub wasn’t working until a few hours after I had already checked in. If I had known either of these things before hand, I would have stayed somewhere else. The hot tub was my priority this Airbnb. She did have an electrician come and work on the hot tub however at 9 PM of my last night, the hot tub was 82°. A hot tub should be around 103°. I never got to use it.
There were at least a couple dogs at the home that I was told would be relatively quiet. They were not. They barked almost every time I walked anywhere near their door. Upon check in, there was a little girl in the room with what I assume was the dog sitter and she loudly sang Elmo songs for nearly 90 minutes. I am not exaggerating."

Stayed one night","Ms. Toni was an absolutely amazing and gracious host for so many reasons. She always responded quickly and communicated very well. She went the extra mile to make sure my daughter and I were comfortable and had what we needed (and wanted). The entire time that we spent there was sprinkled with God moments. You will not regret your stay at Ms. Toni's home. It's breathtaking, inspiring, serene, and spotless."

Stayed one night","I stayed one night at Toni's home and she could not have been a more friendly and gracious host. Her home is beautiful and well located not far from Interstate highway I-59. I booked late in the day and Toni was able to accommodate me with no problem. The bed was very comfortable and I got a good night's sleep before a long drive the next day. Toni embodies ""southern hospitality"" and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Hattiesburg to stay with Toni. I wish I had more time than I did to walk the surrounding neighborhood. Toni was also able to recommend a local breakfast place, Topher's, not far from her home that was perfect before resuming my trip. I hope to stay again at Toni's home someday."

She has every room decorated so chic and instantly makes you feel cozy when you walk through the front door. Honestly, her home is so beautiful that it could be in an interior designer's magazine.

If you ever go to or through this area and need a place to stay, I highly recommend it. We had everything we needed and Toni was never more than a text away.
We love animals and never missed an opportunity to hang out with her feathered and fur babies. They do have their own area to be in though so if you aren’t into that, it’s no problem either.
We missed several eating and shopping spots due to the timing of our visit so will most definitely be back to the area and would stay here again, without question."

The house/rental space is beautiful, decorated with serene colors and comfortable furnishings. The lake in the back was icing on the cake as far as the “place” goes.
Then there’s the host - Toni was great!!! Before we arrived, she was helpful and precise with check-in instructions, as well as recommending restaurants and things to do in the area. And while we were in the house, it literally felt like her home was our home. She was so welcoming, it felt like visiting a long-time friend. A very respectful host!
Highly recommend!!!"

Of course, we both are alumni of HHS! So that made everything 1000x better, and to top it off, she even work there. That made me feel so good to know she went back to teach. That made my heart melt.
Elvis, the parrot is the real entertainment of the house. He will talk up a storm and try to over talk you. He does sing Elvis songs. Just hearing him talk really brighten my day.
The stay is one of a kind; and every time I come home, I will be booking with her. Thank you Mrs. Toni for everything. SMTTT"

The decor was nostalgic and reminiscent of our time together at our grandmother and aunt home, where we used to stay when in Hattiesburg.
The Taylor's were excellent in communicating from my first inquiry about the rental , checking in, inquiries during our stay, and following up on post checkout.
The home and accommodations are easily a 5, I only rated it 4 overall due to the cookware. However, they were apologetic and advised that they would take care of it for future occupancy.
This will certainly be our first choice when returning to the area."

There were plenty of clean rooms and bathrooms for our large party, the kitchen was huge, and we had everything we needed to make meals. The 2 living rooms and dining rooms made it easy for all to sit/talk/eat, etc. The game room with a pool table made for enjoyable rounds of pool, while the screened-in porch with the ping pong table provided another avenue of fun (although it was hot out there!). The house afforded us a place away from home to enjoy the upcoming festivities. Grocery stores and fast food restaurants were close by and the house was easily accessible to the Hwy 98 and 59. We would definitely stay here again!
Our super host, Taylor, was very responsive to our questions/concerns and was easily accessible through the Airbnb site."

Our daughter graduated from USM so it was nice to have family and friends from out of town come and stay with us! Perfect space for entertaining outdoors OR indoors! The pictures don’t do this home justice. Everyone who came had something great to say about this MASSIVE and unique house! We enjoyed teaching the teens about rotary phones, encyclopedias and 8-Track tape players!! The ONLY thing that would improve this property would be a swimming pool! But we bought our granddaughter an inflatable pool to play in the spacious back yard! I would recommend this property to anyone I talk to! If we have a future need, we would return here!"

An ideal gathering spot for all of our Hattiesburg family and those staying in hotels. We had 20 folks for most dinners and general hanging out - ranging in age from 8 months to 94 years old and never once felt crowded. There's enough space that loud game play in the dining room didn't disturb sleeping babies in another part of the house. Huge backyard. The screened porch is amazing. Photos don't do it justice, and the sunsets were just beautiful sitting on the porch with a glass of wine. The house has a retro feel in all the right ways and Taylor was a pure delight as a host!"

We grew up in this house, and were thrilled to get to continue the tradition of all being together for Thanksgiving, without the stress of cleaning and prepping for the week. The local family members came over every day, and we had plenty of room for 28 of us to eat and cook various meals. The kids loved the game room and the parents loved that we could be upstairs visiting, while the kids played outside and in the game room. Great location, plenty of space, and everything you need right there on hand. Taylor was wonderful about all aspects of the experience from booking through checkout. We’ve already reserved for next year."

Stayed a few nights","Best stay ever - We have stayed in over 20 rentals since our retirement, and this one is our current favorite. It is in a great neighborhood and only minutes from the Longleaf Trace bicycle trailhead, which was our reason for visiting this area.
The place was pleasantly decorated and had everything we needed to enjoy our week biking the local trail. We loved the lighting, the TV instructions, the new shower, and all the counter space in both the kitchen and the bathroom. The bed was extra comfy and though we didn't get to use the pool, we did enjoy some time on the putting green right next to the rental. This place had everything and it was obvious that a ton of thought was put into making this a perfect experience for anyone staying there.
We love our law enforcement people and we were honored to be able to rent from a retired LE officer. He was super friendly and we really enjoyed our visit with him on our last day there. We hope to be able to return for another visit soon."
