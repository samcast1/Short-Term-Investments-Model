Stayed with kids","Absolutely beautiful home. Cozy and homey. Walked into a clean space that provided everything we needed for our stay. My husband appreciated the koozies provided for his cold beverages. Even though we didn’t get to hang out in the backyard due to the cold weather during our visit, it looked spacious; we will definitely be returning during the spring to enjoy a cup of coffee and book on the back porch. The host was very prompt in responding to our messages and was flexible with check in. Highly recommend this little home to anyone visiting this area of Kansas. 10/10 stars!"

Some specifics, all necessary utensils were provided (wine opener, coffee filters, extra pillows/blankets, etc ). Every night, i looked forward to the comforts of the kitchen and living room. The beds are very comfortable giving me some of my best nights sleep. Nothing more to say other than staying there was a highlight of my week."

The large kitchen allowed us big fellas a place to enjoy some food at the end of a long day hunting.
The garage space was able to keep our hunting clothes and gear secure.
A sweet cat and friendly dog greeted us each day and evening!
Perfection!"

We were informed of this after we Checked in and told to let them know if it was too loud, which we did, but there was no rest/sleep possible until after midnight. We wouldn’t have booked here if we had known about the outdoor party."

Stayed with kids","AWESOME!! There are not a lot of places to stay around family in southeastern Kansas, especially with a kitchen so we can cook for my youngest with food allergies (eating out is nearly impossible unless we go to Oklahoma). This was a dream for all of us! We could cook, kids (and mom and dad) loved the coffee bar, kids loved the popcorn, we all loved the dogs, and the kids LOVED feeding the baby goats and looking for chicken eggs. The place was super clean, super nice, and you got A LOT for what we paid. We will definitely be staying here again when we visit family. Don’t pay for a hotel when you could stay here!!!"

Stayed with kids","The barndo was immaculate and comfortable. Despite being directly behind the owner’s space, it felt private and was very quiet. My kids loved checking out the horse and goats, and they made besties with the kitten who stopped by to check us out. The coffee and cocoa bar was so well stocked, and there were plentiful snacks, breakfast options, filtered water, and cooking basics. My kids loved making popcorn in the air popper and using the popcorn bags. Both beds were comfy, and the living room had three recliners, an electric fireplace, and some cozy blankets that made for a nice place to unwind and watch a movie after our drive. My kids loved playing the games that were available and I appreciated that there was plenty of space for them to get some energy out by running around outside. I can’t think of much I might have needed that wasn’t there, but I will say that my absolute favorite part was that the entire space was decorated for Christmas!"

Stayed with kids","This house was wonderful. Lots of room to visit, a spacious kitchen, comfortable beds, large patio, plenty of places to sit inside and an awesome kitchen and laundry room. Our family was in town for a reunion around the entombment of my parents cremains. It was stressful but we were able to wind down together (4 adults, 2 young people) at the end of each day. Because of the location we had gorgeous views of the night sky with little light pollution and town was within walking distance. I highly recommend booking this house if you are coming to the Cherryvale area. There are lots of things to do in the area: Fishing, hunting, historic places, and cultural events are all within walk and/or driving distance. Our family came from California, North Dakota, and Alaska and we are in consensus: this house was perfect for us in every way."

Stayed with a pet","Beyond Perfect! It may look like a simple Ranch Barn from the outside but inside you’ll find an exceptionally clean, comfortable “home away from home”. Cleverly decorated to reflect the Ranch/Barn theme with upgraded finishes. Spacious with a well stocked kitchen and comfortable beds/furniture. We were welcomed with so many “extras” including a well stocked coffee /popcorn bar & breakfast/snack items. The patio is covered, festively lit at night and set up to enjoy outdoor grilling/dining or just relaxing by the fire pit. It felt peaceful & private.
We’ve already booked again for our hunting trip in Nov/Dec."

Stayed about a week","Rented the Kusel House for a family wedding held at the Cedar Tree Barn (right around the corner) that rolled into the Thanksgiving 2023 holiday. I don't think this review captures the gratitude and appreciation our camp had for the Kusel House. Truly home away from home. G-Maps doesn't take you directly to the house using its street address. Called Kelly to find it. Each room clean, fully stocked, and equipped with strong broadcasting Wi-Fi throughout the house (huge plus). Clean, comfortable, and maintained outside deck and yards. Many people commented on the possible business connection the house has to the Cedar Tree Barn around the corner. Thoughtful decorative touches and living comforts brought back lots of family memories from our childhoods in Southeast Kansas. I thought the downstairs (mancave and bar) is where the real added value was. A gracious and thoughtful host, Kelly was quick to offer, respond, and act on our needs. Highly recommend the Kusel House."

Pete and Anita, we're very responsive to any need I had. These two folks are truly great people. The place was very quiet. Very Private. Everything was in working order. I will be returning to this property again."

The price is excellent for country stay, not far from most anything you need! You won’t go wrong by staying at the cottage.

Country charm, yet a short drive to Bartlesville. Anita and Pete are priceless. They are so very kind and welcoming. Truly genuine. My husband had to travel to Bartlesville for work and we came across this gem. We stayed for nearly 3 weeks the first trip and we're currently staying for another 2 weeks. If my husband needs to come back for work this will be our first choice. I highly recommend a stay at Eagles Nest Cottage. You will feel right at home."

There was water and snacks, a coffee maker with choices for beverages, a sitting area to watch TV, and my favorite part, fireflies at night! Location was perfect for us. Definitely recommend staying at the Cottage if you plan on being in the area."

The cottage was perfect for us - comfy bed, the location allowed was perfect for our travel plans in the surrounding areas.... with a vaulted ceiling, a well-panned open area and a large bathroom, it felt very spacious and cozy at the same time... and perfect for the 2 of us... the country setting was a breath of fresh air (literally) - loved the tulips in bloom and the birds on the feeder and serenading us in the trees...
Add to all that the comfy bed and everything we needed to make our stay... yes, perfect!
So glad we found this place! Since we have family in the area, I know we'll be going back if it's available!"

The place was light and airy, very clean, well kept, spacious, private and peaceful. My husband and I were able to relax comfortably - watched football, did jigsaw puzzles, slept, read. We really enjoyed sitting outside to read and appreciate the beautiful flowering shrubs in the garden. During our stay we also visited some historic sites and local restaurants in Bartlesville (only a 25 minute drive), and went for walks around beautiful Copan Lake. Anita was very welcoming, friendly and willing to help any way she could. Thank you Anita, for providing such a nice get-away place!!"

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing, peaceful & beautiful spot to BE!! I came to BE. I came to enjoy my first ""Personal Prayer Retreat!""This place was it! Anita and her husband, Pete, were the perfect hostess and host. They were responsive to whatever I needed, but I was also left to my own introspection. All the bases are covered! It's spotlessly clean, airy, light. One of the reasons I chose The Eagle's Nest is the coastal decor. Being a ""lake person,"" I wanted the coastal feeling, and the cottage delivered!
This is a perfect spot for an individual or a couple. Bear in mind that I was drinking juices while here, so I didn't need a big kitchen. If you are looking to ""cook up a storm,"" you'll want to save that for another location. However, having said that, the amenities are perfect for fixing food. Just make sure you note what they are.
I was so very satisfied with my stay that I plan to return again. I think the little birdies will still be flitting about the beautiful garden and coming in for landings on the bird feeder. What a joy to watch them through the great window facing the garden.
There's a lot of love that has gone into the creation of this oasis and I'm glad I was able to sit in the midst of it and return home refreshed.
Don't hesitate to book a stay. You will not be sorry. Don't wait for lots of reviews. This is a hidden gem that will soon have a long waiting list of guests! Get in while you can!"

We cooked several meals, but went out for a nice dinner (less than 10 minutes from the house). Many amenities close- but we only went out once. Beautiful setting (we fished - and caught) and had several nice walks. Recommended for couples needing a bit of down-time. Our dog 'Bubba' sure enjoyed having run of the place as well! Thanks to Kim & Wyatt for the warm welcome- we hope to stay with you again sometime!"

The land this place sits on is spacious and walkable. We'll definitely be stopping by again! Thanks for everything Kimberly!

The yard had trash scattered everywhere and the trashcan in the back looked like critters had gotten in it. The place had everything you could need and extra shampoo and such in the bathroom if you forgot something. Unfortunately there were dirty utensils that were with the clean dishes that we washed. Couldn’t empty the garbage because outside can was full."

Stayed with a pet","Watching our gps we drove past the house cause of the AWESOME decorations and said “this can’t be it , it’s too nice”! But to our surprise it was! We pulled through the coded gate and parked under the carport. When we opened the back door and flipped on the lights, I thought, did we die on the road over here and this is heaven?! Oh my! The game room was the first thing we saw with the pool table, shuffle board, juke box, the coin shuffle game! Then we walked through the whole house snapping pics sending it to our friends and family! The last time I was in someone’s house snapping pics was GRACE MANSION! When Our family arrived to celebrate Christmas they were floored too! It could easily accommodate several families. This was our first Airb&b and it won’t be the last!
Thanks Mrs Debra !

The kitchen is fully stocked, the showers and the beds are beyond comfortable and being able to stay at this house fulfilled my childhood curiosity as growing up I always wanted to see inside of the pink house that I thought was the mansion of all mansions :-). Debora is extremely nice and very hospitable!! An early check in wasn't a problem and nor was a late check out. Thank you so much Debora!! We will be back!!"

Stayed with kids","It is always such a pleasure to stay at Crystal’s place. We love it so much we’re repeat customers and will likely be staying here again in the future. Love how close it is to Independence but we always visit family in Cherryvale.
The lodge is more than what you expect. Each room has its own bathroom so it’s easy to stay with everybody without feeling like you’re in each other’s space. So much room to spread out. We love that the kids can be in one living room having a blast while the adults play cards and watch something else in the other living room. We love the mud room since we like to adventure on the property. It makes it so nice to leave all the filth where it doesn’t spread through the house. The porch spaces are both great and equally used to maximize the comfortability of the frequently changing weather and to accommodate the separation of groups during visiting."

Stayed with kids","Great space with lots of room for the family but there were some concerns. Things differed a bit from pictures (no bunk bed and missing couch). Grass was overgrown when we got there and we had to ask if it could be cut. Owner was very responsive and it was cut that day. Some of the things in the kitchen were dirty. Coffee grounds and old coffee left in coffee maker. Instant pot lid was dirty and had mold on the seal. The grill was very dirty and there was no wire brush for cleaning it. Also found a dead mouse in a mouse trap behind the microwave that had apparently been there for some time. Only four coffee mugs available. No ice. There was a nice island that has been added to the kitchen that made serving meals helpful. But we hadn't realized there is no dishwasher there until we got there. Wasps were a bit of a problem in the back. Overall we enjoyed our time there and because the owner was responsive I would stay there again, but feel it was quite overpriced for what we experienced."

The layout of the house is wonderful for staying with family/friends, with 2 living areas and an open kitchen. We enjoyed having our own private bathroom with each bedroom. We invited other family members over for games and fellowship and they all agree we should use the Golden Timber Lodge for our next family reunion!"

It is 5 bedrooms. 1 of the bedrooms is separated from the other 4 which made it very nice. Our ages ran from 3-83. So the “old” folks had a quiet separate area. Everything was clean. There is a map of the property which made navigation for the kids so easy. I can’t think of a single negative thing to say about our stay! I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s for 7 years and this is by far the best overall experience I’ve had. We will gladly stay here every year

When we asked about her furbaby, she stopped by so that we could meet her and ZuZu! ZuZu played wonderfully with the boys. Kimberly was very considerate and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. The pond behind the house was great for fishing. Area around the house was also great for kite flying, and hiking. We loved our stay and have already been talking about our next trip back. EXCELLENT place and would highly recommend it to anyone."

We loved the quietness of the area and simplicity of the week we had staying there. They supplied everything we needed and more. We have always stayed at hotels but our daughter happened upon this little cottage and we are now hooked. very quiet, peaceful and wonderful experience. we will definatly contact Kimberly and Lon again when we are in town. Thank you again for such a wonderful stay and experience. Shawn and Betty Anne"

After a long hot ride on the motorcycle the water was welcomed by myself and my son. We were able to do a load of laundry as well. Very comfortable beds. The shower was amazing. I would definitely recommend to others.

My husband and I slept in that room and were blinded by the streetlight that shines through those white blinds at night. It was almost impossible to sleep because it was so bright. The place itself was clean, cutely decorated, smelled great, had a nice kitchen and washer dryer. The bed itself was super comfy. The house is at the end of a cute cul d sac. Great place for great $."

Stayed with kids",This is a unique place in the country with beautiful bathroom fixtures and comfortable beds. The living room furniture was also very comfortable. We had some trouble with the plumbing but Jeannette was very fair and quick to try and get it fixed. There is no basement or storm shelter which can be a little unnerving when you’re surrounded by fields during a bad storm.

The secluded cabin is not far from the good fishing, hunting, and other outdoor opportunities just to north of the place. If you are in the area you have to check this place out, you won't regret it. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The hosts checked in often to make sure everything was perfect for us. They were very nice, helpful, and responsive! All in all, it was a wonderful experience!"

David’s home met all our needs during our stay to visit family. While we were only there to sleep and get ready for the day each morning, we found it to be very cozy and a convenient location. Bed was very comfortable! During our stay we only had one question and David was very responsive. He also offered us early check in and late checkout. Thank you David for making our first visit to Coffeyville a pleasant one :-) Should we come again we would love to stay at your place."

Our son was an intern at Cessna and for future interns, I have to say if you are able to secure this property you will be the envy of all the other interns. The home was outstanding and there was far more to offer than David shares in his post. The screened porch and all the activities available to the renters were exceptional. If you are looking for a safe and peaceful location David has the spot for you. Thanks for a great stay David and making the internship stay a fantastic experience for our son and his intern roommate. Paul and Georgia"

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time I've stayed in the Coffeyville Cape Cod and when I come into town to visit family, I'll never stay anywhere else again. It's decorated with vintage minimalist treasures, straight out of a digest - almost as if walking straight into a Mad Men set, and it's flawlessly cleaned and stocked every time. The beds are as comfortable as my bed at home, and we were greeted by a Christmas tree and vintage Christmas decor this holiday. What a treat. Thank you, David!"

Host was very easy to get a hold of, but we did not need to during our stay. Close to several local businesses and restaurants, walking distance to the hospital. Would highly recommend and we will be repeat visitors!"
