It was walkable distance to the Cracker Barrel. This was a definite bonus as we had to leave our aunt with our son one day without a vehicle due to moving our daughter into the university. Our son who runs Crosscountry could access river trail to run another bonus! The condo was bright and a happy place to come home to which was just what I needed. Even the residents in the other condos were friendly and helpful as well. Thank you again for a great stay!"

CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!! When u walk into this condo the pictures do not do justice on what has been done♥️♥️ As we entered the building my kids were whispering going down the hall “mom this is sketchy”only because the building is old and the smells in the hall;) when I opened the door to the condo all I heard was wow, oh my gosh this is so nice, I’ld live here, cool ;). Each room is perfectly put together and having the extra 1/2 bath in master was such a bonus:)
Kids loved the deep pool and the pool towels were a plus. Thank u so much!!
I highly recommend this cute cozy clean condo♥️"

The location was pretty close to all of the family that we were in town to see. Members of the community were very attentive. Dot was very quick with responses to any questions that I had and had very clear check in and check out instructions. I would definitely stay at one of Dot's homes again, maybe without children next time so I'm not as focused on noise."

Stayed with kids","Dot's Place is an exceptional accommodation option that truly exceeded our expectations during our weekend stay. One of the standout features of this place is its remarkable spaciousness. Despite being located within a large building, we were pleasantly surprised by how little noise from other residents we could hear. What truly sets Dot's Place apart is the meticulous attention to detail and thoughtfulness that Dot has put into making it feel like a home away from home. Dot has considered every little thing you may need during your trip, ensuring that guests have a comfortable and convenient experience. From the well-stocked kitchen to the thoughtfully placed amenities, we were constantly amazed by the level of care Dot had put into ensuring our stay was memorable. But what really sets Dot's Place apart is Dot's incredible sense of humor and creativity. The way she has decorated the place is both charming and refreshing. It's a breath of fresh air from the typical cookie-cutter hotel."

I'm sad that we didn't get a chance to utilize the pool, but it's such a great perk of this spot. It would have been nice if shampoo and soap were provided in the shower, but other than that, I was extremely satisfied with our stay. Dot was a responsive host and even messaged me to ask about an item that I had accidentally left behind. Thank you for being a great host!"

It is near the zoo and the big slide, which were two of the things we wanted to do. We didn’t want to use the pool based on our length of stay, so it wasn’t an issue for us, but the pool was closed. The building was quiet and clean. Would definately stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this property. It was amazing and the host was very helpful and responsive!
The modern, creative, and thoughtful decor is what lured us to the property, and it didn't disappoint.
Our overall feeling from staying here was comfort and safety.
The quality of everything, from the beds/bedding to the kitchen, bathroom, and living room was extremely impressive.
We had been apprehensive about the risk of noise in a condo/apartment setting, but honestly, we never heard our neighbors.
The unit was very clean when we arrived. Check-in was easy - good instructions and backup keys.
We can't say enough good things about this property, it's incredible - and we've been traveling for the last 3 years, staying in rental units.
We would go out of our way to stay here again if the property was available on our next trip."

The ""hidden"" bedroom was SO COOL! Everyone enjoyed the acade video games, including the adults! The beds were comfortable. The house was VERY clean. The kids were even allowed to take home one of the adorable stuffed animals they had there to play with! If we travel out this way again, this will for sure be where we stop. Thank you."

A high chair to use and a bed bumper in place of a pack and play. Everything was so clean and smelled so fresh. I loved the “treating it like a hotel” where you don’t have to strip everything down, do your own dishes, etc. it really was so relaxing and we’d stay here anytime we are in town. The added gift was a definite plus! Our kiddo’s 2nd Airbnb stuffie 💜"

I especially appreciate all of the little touches like coffee and hot cocoa, snacks, kitchen with all of the necessities, comfortable sheets, and cozy couch. Cheryl communicated very well when there was a huge blizzard with 17 inches of snow, letting me know where the emergency snow routes were and coming over promptly to shovel. Cheryl is such a friendly and lovely person. She even let me know that the next guest canceled because of the blizzard so I could extend my stay. I will definitely stay again next time I am in Bismarck! Do not hesitate to book. The value is amazing. You will be so comfortable and right at home at Cheryl’s place."

Her home was extremely cozy and inviting and provided so much comfort and consolation. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the living room was a delight. My 7-year-old who traveled with me enjoyed the arcade game and the back room with the double queen bunk beds. Cheryl even provided a stuffy dolphin for my 7 year old who absolutely loved it! There is no doubt that on our many trips to North Dakota to visit our College kiddo, we will be spending future stays at Cheryl's wonderful Airbnb!"

Stayed with kids","This place is the best! It’s places like this one that are why airbnbs are so much better than a chain hotel. Quick and easy check in, great location, very clean, fluffy towels big enough to cover your whole body and it had everything me and my two kids needed and more.
This place is especially fun for kids between the pac man machine, lots of board games, very comfy big bunk beds, chalk wall and necessities like high chairs and kid friendly dishes. Loved the big comfy sectional to snuggle up on w my babies for a little movie night. So many soft blankets lol.
The beds were great and had very fluffy pillows. There were also some less fluffy ones for those who prefer that. I actually ended up in the bunk beds w my daughter bc it was really comfy and at least full size so more than enough space.
I’m sad it rained the whole time we were there bc there’s a great little deck out back and a big back yard. The kids loved the cookies Cheryl left for us. The best part were the special surprises for the kids to take home. We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","Amazing!! I don’t know what makes a “super host”, but this perfectly describes Cheryl. We loved everything about this booking. From the neighborhood, to the fun décor, to the amazing welcome basket, this was the best stay on out 9-day road trip. The kids loved the suspended bunkbeds, and we loved the coffee station. The hidden LED lights around the house was a fun discovery, and the patio was the perfect place for a nightcap as well as a morning cup of coffee. Cheryl clearly paid great attention to detail, and was always available to answer any questions or requests that we had.
The little touches really made this place special and memorable. From the books and games, to the secret bedroom entrance, this house was great. And, when I told Cheryl that my mom and my kids absolutely loved the book of jokes in her library, she insisted that we take it and enjoy it on our trip. I am not big on writing reviews, but this place, and our host, deserve it. I would to stay here again, and would whole heartedly recommend it to everyone."

If you are traveling with kids, they are going to love this place. The kids bunk bed room was like a dream for our 4 and 6 year old kids. We all slept well and comfortably despite the outside temperatures reaching well into the 90s during our July visit. The house was very clean and has everything you would need for an extended stay. It doesn't take long to get to a good grocery store and is pretty conveniently located for a trip to the Dakota Zoo or the North Dakota Heritage Center and State Museum. Those places were a treat for our kiddos. Cheryl was great with communication and the check-in and check-out processes were a breeze. If you are swinging through Bismarck, see if ""Lamppost 15"" is available!"

It's cozy, spacious and honestly had everything we needed and more. The kitchen is well-stocked, it's incredibly comfortable, has several extra touches and Cheryl's communication is fantastic. The location is great, too. We found everything we wanted within a 10 minute drive (including the airport). We didn't have time to use the back deck, but it was lovely and we appreciated two types of coffee pots (grounds or pods). TV, games, movies and this is the only AirBnB I've stayed in where I got to play Ms. Pac Man, so that was a bonus. :-) I highly recommend this AirBnB. The bed was comfortable, quiet neighborhood and was everything we were looking for. Thanks!"

The alpaccas at their farm were so friendly and darling! Miniature cow was interesting! Chickens, and kitties and neighbor’s sheeps in the pasture. ReNae gave us the farm tour and it was so fun to see everrything. Little ones fed and pet all the animals, got to pick some rasberries and peas from the garden.
We sure had great time and would love to go back sometime! Thank you ReNae!"

It was clean, comfortable, well-stocked and has thoughtful touches like handknitted slippers, eggs in the fridge and a super sweet storybook on the coffee table. No ear plugs needed to sleep and we woke up to so much cuteness in the form of alpacas it was almost unbearable! We visited the chickens and picked raspberries in the garden that we ate with whipped cream while sitting on the back patio watching chickadees fly about. I will be looking for excuses to go back to Bismarck to stay here again!"

(Confession, I spent hours online looking for a fun place for our girl's getaway & Apple Creek ended up going way beyond my expectations :))! We loved being in a rural & peaceful farm setting. We visited the alpacas & chickens, made a campfire dinner & hiked at a nearby recreation area.

Little did we know we would stumble upon a little piece of paradise in North Dakota when we told AirBNB just to find us a place Thanksgiving weekend. A beautiful, prisitine cottage with a friendly hostess, amazing animals, near enough to town to get the supplies we needed, while still allowing us to snuggle down with Netflix, puzzles, and family. No intrusions from the outside world, ReNay was always available to answer questions, make suggestions, and introduce us to her animals. We came home refreshed and renewed, ready to face the holidays. Our jaded 13 year old was weepy about leaving, and we all agreed we didn't spend enough time there--next time at least one more night! :) Thank you for everything, ReNay!

Check-in: ReNay allowed us to check in 2 hours early. We had left early trying to beat a wind storm that was blowing snow around. She told us how to get in and asked if we had any questions to reach out. They have instructions and a guest book on the table.
Stay: as a family of 4 ( kids 5,2)the stay was perfect this house has everything you need. We enjoyed many meals at the table, watch movies, played games (some provided). They have a pac-n-play for littles. ReNay gave us a tour of the farm, introduced the alpacas to us, told us about her property. She took us to the chicken coop and let the kids feed the chickens treats. She got sleds out for us so we could sled on the hill in front of their house. She said we could help ourselves to visit the animals through out the week we stayed there.
Check-out: smooth and easy and ReNay reached out to check and say goodbye!
Great place to stay! We will return when we are in the area."

Quality kitchen and amenities they added to an out building. Bunk beds were great for kids. We would go out of our way to stay here again.

Very well put together. Super clean, very organized, and very modern with a farm feel. They had board games and smart tv with netflix. I am not much of a farm guy but this was absolutely amazing. The hosts provided us with a great barn experience. We were able to look, pet and take pictures with the alpacas. Not only that but we were able to feed the chickens and my daughter was able to collect some eggs. They also left a nice set of fresh eggs in the fridge so we can eat for breakfast. This is exactly the experience my wife wished to have with our 2 year old. The farm is outstanding and the welcoming message and instructions in the cottage made you feel right at home! They informed us with great local food spots and we loved it. We went to fireflour pizza.
The hosts are very sweet and nice. They were very thoughtful with everything and the attention to detail is bar none. We WILL be coming back and we hope for more than a day. I highly recommend this even if you live in Bismarck. The sunset views are absolutely spectacular! I want a farm now"

A few miles from Bismarck allows for easy access to downtown and the state Capitol grounds and Heritage Museum, while the guest space on the farm allows for a true countryside retreat.
Staying here is both a cozy getaway as well as an actual farm stay. Our 3 year old enjoyed a tour of the 100 year barn, alpacas, cats and chicken coop when he ventured outside.
ReNay and Don are kind and thoughtful hosts who welcome travelers to their peaceful farm and guest house.
The guest house has so much character and everything that a couple of small family needs for a comfortable home base while in the Bismarck area.
Many Thanks!"

The cottage was impeccably clean, comfy, and had everything one could need. We hope to be back again someday!"

While we grilled dinner our children played in the grass in the back of the house following the cats around. ReNay gave us a tour of the alpacas’ barn and chicken coop which was the highlight for our daughters. They feed the chickens and collected eggs. Only regret is not staying longer!

Even the outdoor cats and the family of alpacas were welcoming and absolutely adorable. Definitely recommend staying here!"

Something to keep in mind is that it is a little bit of a walk from the parking spot to front door of the unit (stair and elevator access) but is a similar distance as if you were staying in a hotel."

Dot’s apartment was super clean and had all the amenities we could possibly need. It’s a one bedroom but the living room chair pulled out into a bed that was big enough for our two young kids to share, complete with linens. We also felt safe with the automatic deadbolt and being on the 3rd floor. You could tell Dot put a lot of thought into what guests could need for their stay which made it very comfortable and accommodating (for example, a rolling laundry basket since laundry is down the hall & supplies for the pool). Overall fantastic place in the Bismarck/Mandan area. 10/10 recommend"

Neighbors in the building were mostly welcoming and one even grabbed pool noodles for the kids to use. We booked purely for the pool and the kids were very happy!

Owner included extras in the bathroom in case you forgot your toothbrush or razor, etc. There were snacks and food in the cupboard too. she had a nice pool bag with. beach towel in case you wanted to use the pool and even included a change jar and laundry supplies in case you needed to do laundry.

Communication with the host was great. Check in was easy. I would stay here again."

It was well decorated, and spacious for a one bedroom unit with nice updates throughout. The building is very quiet with plenty of parking, no trouble with WiFi, and all the little amenities and things that you need for a short stay.
I was pleasantly surprised that there were a few snacks and there was tupperware in the cupboards for leftovers, plus real dishes.
Honestly, it felt like a hotel suite that I had all to myself. It was the perfect quiet calm place to stay at for a few nights, and felt like you could settle right in. If I am in Bismarck again I would certainly stay there again. Thanks Dot!"

We have stayed other places in Bismarck but your place is definitely our favorite and we look forward to staying again. We come down a couple times a year just to get out of our town. We just cannot get over how cute your place is. It’s a perfect size and layout too. Thank you so much!
For anyone considering reserving: it was exceptionally clean, no long list of chores to do beyond basic decency such as where to put wet towels, all linens are crisp white and smell fresh, the bathroom has a lovely selection of essential oils to diffuse with a diffuser, the bed is incredibly soft without too much give, there is an adequate amount of dishes, cookware, and utensils if you choose to stay in and cook, and the home is well heated throughout. (We stayed in winter) Honestly, I’d love to buy this house as is! You won’t regret choosing to stay here. If you have children, there is a selection of toys as well."

Little things like a diffuser with essential oils, bathroom toiletries and necessities, local restaurant menus, and someone clearing the driveway and walkway for us was also noticed and appreciated.
Thank you Aaron for such a great stay (even with the huge storm)!!"

Oatmeal and cereal in the pantry for breakfast, Keurig for coffee in the morning. Oh, and the fancy w+d ready to go if you needed it! Aaron really thought of it all, and we really appreciated it.

As soon as you walk in you feel the modern and clean lines of the house. Fridge was stocked with water and some soda's, there was a choices of coffe pods and breakfast cereal for the kids. Kitchen was nicely done and we utilize it during our stay. Bedroom's were nice and clean as well as the bathroom. there was even a oil diffuser with a lot of essential oil choices.
I recommend this house to all and we will definitely stay there again for the future swim meets."

I felt bad. They let me do my wash; visited (""get to know""); and offered me food & coffee. EXCELLENT coffee, btw. Bed was amazing. I ""run hot"" and they offered a portable a/c that I didn't use, since there...only 1 night. I'd stay here again. And, while anyone would be most welcomed & feel comfortable at this stay of Mary Ellen's, I will highly recommend this environment to women especially. I do not bring pets however I think this is a pet friendly site (confirm for yourself). While awaiting for my next home to become move-in ready (which date keeps getting kicked down the road by the current owner), I couldn't of stumbled across a better people or place during career transition & relocation processes. Thank you."

Even though we showed up a bit later (and had two rats with us!) she welcomed us at the door like we were family, shared both dinner and breakfast with us, and personally led me and my partner to a lovely place to walk alongside the Missouri River. You can absolutely tell that she provides her service for the love of sharing hospitality with anyone visiting the area. Even though we were just passing through and needed someplace to rest our heads that night, Mary Ellen provided an unforgettable experience for us - Someday, we hope we may open an AirBNB just like hers! If we ever find ourselves in that part of the country again, there is nowhere else I’d rather stay."

Stayed one night",I'm truly thankful that I chose to stay at Mary Ellen's place. One of the hard things about traveling for work is the loneliness and boredom one faces in a hotel. It felt so good on a sub zero evening to have someone waiting for me with a warm welcome and cup of tea and an offer of either ham and eggs or pancakes for breakfast. I'd have to say that my stay at Mary Ellens was just about the highlight of my trip to Bismarck.

Stayed with a pet","the second I got there, I immediately felt right at home. Mary's home reminded me so much of my great grandma's home that I haven't been in for at least 20 years. she had so many homey touches like candy and snacks in the room, toiletries and she even offered to make me breakfast 🥹 I was able talk to Mary in the morning before I left and she is such a kind and interesting person. I know people often talk about southern hospitality, but I have spent the majority of the last year in the Great Plains states and I think the people here far outdo any southern hospitality I've ever experienced! If I ever travel through Mandan again, I would book Mary's place 100 times over!"

I had some issues, it took an extra few hours to clear customs, pushing my eta closer to 12am and she waited up to greet me and make sure I got settled in. A meticulously clean and cozy room awaited me with snacks and a heated blanket. She welcomed my pooches with open arms and cuddles. She even made me breakfast and lunch! I then locked my keys in my car, and she was so patient and kind while leaving late, waiting for the locksmith to come. I absolutely love Airbnbs with exceptional experiences, and her energy is just that. A steal of a deal for how she goes above and beyond for guests and with such kindness. Very safe, quiet, and beautiful neighborhood. This will now be my official hub while on the road!"

And holy cow is it affordable! Mary Ellen was great with communication, and it was so clear that she cares for all the people who stayed in her home. And we’re not just saying that - she went out of her way to make us a breakfast and coffee, and sent us off with rhubarb desserts! Who does that?!? Someone as great as Mary Ellen, that’s who 😊 We loved getting to know her, and she loved hearing about our travels. The room and home had everything we needed, we got a great night’s sleep, and we enjoyed poking around Mandan. Sitting around the breakfast table with Mary Ellen and another guest made us feel like the early days of Airbnb - when it was centered in community and hospitable care. Thank you Mary Ellen!"

So much snow we were hard pressed to find parking as only one lane open on street. Ann went above and beyond to get the drive cleared.

The house was in a great location for us and we got to spend some fantastic family time together there. Our running joke was adopted from one of the inspirational signs posted in the house, ""You call it chaos, we call it family!"" Amen to that. There was some unfortunate major city construction happening on the street just outside our windows, but that didn't stop us from having a wonderful trip."

Keurig coffee, ample towels, extra toiletries and fun little notes throughout the space. The location was perfect with quick access to Washington St, Expressway or the Interstate. It felt just like I was staying with an old friend or relative!"

Stayed a few nights","You can tell Peggy has been a host for a while. Communication was clear and in multiple formats (Airbnb messages and written on a bulletin board inside the apartment). Little thoughtful touches were also present like a custom passcode for the door just for you and hand sanitizer key chain.
The unit is slightly odd and kitschy and I mean that as a complement. Many decors in Airbnb are predictable and forgettable. This place is a strange and welcoming mutation between your Grandmother’s house, a time machine back to the 90s, and something I don’t know what. It looks like this place has been renovated several times and the furnishings don’t match at all. There are 3 types of flooring, the refrigerator is in the living room for some reason, there is a mini secret passage way between two of the rooms through the closet, there are mirrors in odd places, the bathroom has Finish style sauna wood paneling....I loved it. They don’t make places like these. Everything is a mishmash. One room is like your grandmother’s parlor and another room has VHS tapes of your favorite movies from the 80s and 90s. There are two mildly creepy dolls in one room and a case containing old reading glasses. I feel that a very good “This American Life” episode could be made about this apartment. It isn’t ugly. It isn’t beautiful. It is what it is.
The neighborhood is about a block away from the Kiwanis park and it was nice to walk around after a long drive."

Stayed one night",I had a great stay at this apartment right near the hear of Bismarck. The check-in process was very easy with parking on-site in the driveway and a lockbox for contactless check-in. The apartment was clean and had everything you need for a comfortable stay. Peggy was responsive and very accommodating; I would recommend this stay to anyone passing through Bismarck.

I had to take the futon, and honestly it was a bit uncomfortable- anyone bigger than me (5’8, 150lbs) would have a really hard time sleeping on it. But, that’s the nature of futons I suppose!

The responsive communication and willingness to be flexible to accommodate our travel delays was above and beyond.
Mikaela was also very transparent on any updates on the property and helpful in reminding us on the procedures for check -in and check-out.
I would highly recommend a stay with Mikaela and when we returning to Bismarck we will be booking with her again, if the property is available.
If you’re looking for a property that has it all, then I would really consider this accommodation during your visit to Bismarck North Dakota."

The place itself was immaculate and well-maintained. We felt right at home thanks to the cozy atmosphere and excellent amenities provided. The kitchen was fully equipped, which allowed us to enjoy a lovely cookout with our family.
Overall, our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, making our special celebration even more memorable. Thank you, Mikaela, for providing such a wonderful experience! Highly recommend this Airbnb to others."

Consider it a home away from home and newly built to-boot. From the beautiful décor, lovely blackout shades on bedroom windows, a bathroom accessible for both bedrooms and washer + dryer, you'll have everything you need for a comfortable stay. Kick back and watch a movie, enjoy the array of things to do in Bismarck or enjoy a fire (wood provided) in the backyard to round out a great day. This host was very responsive, thoughtful and very friendly. Would definitely be my first choice for another stay in Bismarck!"

This home is designed for rest, comfort, and is a great a retreat for pampering yourself and loved one/s. The hosts are also very nice people who are available if you need them. I felt inspired in the kitchen. my daughter spent most of the weekend enjoying the high ceilings in the bathroom where she set up headquarters and started at herself in the mirror.

As the other group viewers have stated, Dakota really has a knack for decorating, the place looks like it belongs in magazine. It’s like walking into a museum and having a sensory overload because there’s so many things to look at. The kitchen was stocked with everything you could possibly need, including fancy drinkware for our bloody Mary’s and skewers for the garnish.
It was super convenient and close to everything, there was a problem with the automatic door lock but Dakota was on site to fix it for me immediately. This is a split level home with three floors and she lives in the basement, this wasn’t as weird as it sounds when I write it, we never saw her unless we needed her. The bed linens were extra nice, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. This gem makes Air BnB look good."

The kitchen is stocked better than mine at home. I shared my time at Dakotah’s with two of my cousins who I haven’t spent time with for years, and it was a perfect home to do so. Great conversation seating, outdoor deck to enjoy coffee, wine, and conversation. Dakotah’s outdoor seating areas and unique ‘yard’ were amazing. I appreciated having direct contact with Dakotah and she was extremely responsive. Her interior decorating is amazing. I don’t know how many times my cousins and I said, “Can you imagine if we had stayed in two motel rooms for this visit.” AND, it ended up being less expensive (and definitely more enjoyable) than if we had stayed in a motel. THANK YOU, Dakotah, for providing us the perfect place for our wonderful time together."

The kitchen is very well stocked with just about anything you might need. The garden and deck were lovely places to sit and enjoy the summer evening. The host is helpful and responded quickly to questions. This Airbnb is a lovely choice.

She has the most beautiful and relaxing home, that was a much needed retreat after a day of work. The communication, ease, and care taken to pamper her guests shows. Thank you Dakotah for making a business trip an unexpected mini vacation."

Stayed a few nights","A hidden gem! From the moment you enter the door you are greeted with beautiful decor and thoughtful touches that elevate this home beyond expectations. It felt like walking into a chic Manhatten apartment or an Italian Villa in Bismarck ND. The garden and outdoor seating area was lovely, I was able to harvest few tomatoes and some lovely fresh peas. The host added lovely surprises throughout the home( hospitality basket on the kitchen counter, chocolates on the bed) I loved the collection of.cookbooks above the stove. The entire home was comfortable and inviting. The bed was amazing! Communication with the host was great, check in was easy. Dakotah was ready with suggestions for things to do in the area if needed. We go to Bismarck frequently and I will definitely look for an open booking in this home for dates we will be there before booking anything else."

She went above and beyond with so many sweet little details, and hers is one of the cleanest AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed in. The neighborhood is nice, quiet, and super close to a new housing development with sidewalks, great for running or walking! We didn’t hear the neighbors whatsoever, and the outdoor garden is pure serenity! We are so grateful we found her AirBnB!"

That was very much appreciated because that was one less item we had to pack. The house is beautiful and cozy. The bed is very comfy!! My husband and I slept like babies!! The garage was very nice to have since the weather was very cold and snowy! We will definitely stay here again. Very clean and well kept.

Stayed a few nights","We were really, really happy with this rental and would definitely recommend and rent again. Host was very responsive and helpful and house was very clean. Did not hear any noise from neighbors, and development was very quickly plowed when we had several inches of snow. Great location for us. Easy to reach the interstate and major highway, but not so close that you could see or hear either. It was near a grocery store, gas, bagels, fast casual restaurants, pharmacy, etc. Good size for 2 adults and two teen boys. The house is very carefully decorated, so its not a place to rent if you are planning to party. Very, shall we say ""energetic"", little children need to be respectful of the house as well."

Stayed a few nights",Dakotah’s place was great. Lots of room for me and my daughter. Very clean and the beds were really comfortable. Plenty of amenities for cooking but since it was just the two of us we ate out while there. Convenient to the interstate and stores but you definitely need a car. Would stay again if we ever came back to Bismarck.

Stayed a few nights","Let me start out by saying that Dakotah was terrific. She was accommodating, up front, and attentive. The house was warm and welcoming, with small touches of Dakotahs' charming personality dashed throughout the house. The heated double car garage was heaven sent considering the sub 20 degree Temps. The residence is perfectly located near the main street but far enough away to not hear traffic. We will definitely look here first when we return to complete another project in the spring."

It was so refreshing to be able to meet such a wonderful person and build a friendship over the 6 wks I stayed at her beautiful, luxurious home. I had no idea what to expect when I arrived in Bismarck ND, but I can honestly say out of the many airbnb's ive stayed at across the country this is definitely one of my favorites. The home is very spacious, cozy, and beautifully decorated. It is evident that Dakotah took much effort in attending to all the minute details and making sure her home was furnished with all the finest amenities. I can only offer the highest recommendation for her place and Im so grateful I stayed here as opposed to a hotel."
