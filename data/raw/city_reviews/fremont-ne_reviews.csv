Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect weekend getaway spot. Just big enough for me and my wife, but not extra large.
A quick hike up the hill reveals a fantastic sunset, but it is also breathtaking from the fire pit.
The only thing I I would have wanted different is if there were more shades on the windows. Especially the widows showing the master bedroom, the were small windows and the weren’t easily visible from outside, but I would have liked a touch more privacy."

Nature Center was our favorite place to hike near the grain bin. Would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I reserved this beautiful Silo for my daughter and son-in-law's anniversary. It was a surprise and they had no idea where they were going (the Loess Hills) or where they were staying (The Silo). They loved every bit of it! The location was amazing and peaceful. They were able to walk the property, sit under a beautiful night sky full of stars, enjoy a bonfire and the twinkle lights. For them it was perfect! Christy made it so easy and welcoming, even leaving them a bottle of champagne for thier anniversary celebration! Every detail of the place was perfect and it was an experience. They have not stopped talking about it since they got home. They loved it!
On my end, as the coordinator of this anniversary trip, I can say that Christy is probably the best communicator I have ever encountered in my time getting vacation rentals. Not only in relaying needed information at the outset but even answering questions promptly, in some cases in real time! Amazing stay, amazing hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I spent two nights at the bin. Having grown up on a farm, it was the nicest grain bin I’ve ever been in! 😄
Very well-decorated, extremely clean, and easy to find. Really unique lighting, too. The staircase was steep and spiral but easy to manage. No worries there.
We enjoyed the hiking trails behind the bin that wound their way up into the Loess Hills. Quite the view from up there!
We took a short and easy trip to Omaha to the Boiler Room for dinner. We enjoyed hiking the trails at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge just down the road and had a nice visit at the nearby Loess Hills Lavender Farm, too.
All and all, it was a great stay and a perfect place to relax and enjoy the great outdoors while having all the comforts of home!
The host is great to work with…responsive to any questions you may have!"

Stayed a few nights","We had wonderful stay for a 2-night girlfriends trip. The space is unique, and well appointed. Enjoyed the firepit and the abundance of stars at night. Walked up both paths on the property to see the beautiful views! The location is convenient to many natural areas including Desoto Wildlife area for birding and Loess Forest for hiking. (Preparation Canyon was a truly beautiful walk!!!) We highly recommend you stay at this wonderful home!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful little getaway! I spent the first two nights solo as there is some of the state’s best hiking nearby and the location has a great centralized spot for the hikes. My family joined on the third day and fell in love with the place. You can tell there was a lot of pride with this renovation and no corners were cut. The place is in great shape, has many amenities, appliances, and a beautiful view. We hope to visit again!
TIP: if you are able to make it to either of the two lookout spots on the hills (short little hikes), absolutely take advantage of it and catch a sunset. The view is stunning!"

Stayed with kids",This place was the perfect get away for us to spend some time with our kids. The weather wasn’t the best so spent a lot of time indoors in this cozy grain bin! Has all the amenities you could ever need during our stay. We adventured around to some of the small town restaurants and hiking in the Loess Hills which also kept us busy. There’s also 20 acres of hiking to 2 look-out points right on the property! Would highly recommend for anyone wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of city living! Beautiful property.

Stayed a few nights","This is a one-of-a-kind getaway with beautiful surroundings and a creatively renovated grain bin. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Definitely make sure you are able to manage steep steps. If you are planning to sleep in, you need to know that there are no window coverings (except in the bathroom). You will know when the sun comes up. Although there are no window coverings, the grain bin mostly faces the hills where no one can see in."

Stayed a few nights","Easily 5 stars!
One of the cleanest AirBNB properties we’ve stayed in. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom and kitchen amenities were just perfect.
We didn’t have any issues whatsoever, but when I did contact the host, they were very responsive.
We stayed in November and still made use of the bonfire pit for dinner and s’mores. The sky, the stars, the ambiance was so relaxing.
Our family enjoys hiking - and the Loess Hills in Iowa is a perfect destination. We enjoyed the hiking trails right on the property,
Including catching a sunset from an overlook. We also drove north to the state forest and hiked! The binder on-site has super helpful information for local hikes.
This AirBNB property is just as described! You’ll enjoy the unique setting and retreat-like getaway. Highly recommend!"

Brent and Christy have done a wonderful job designing it! You can see the intricacies and effort that they put in to designing and building it! The trails and overlooks we’re both awesome, and my favorite was the LED lights in the ceiling!"

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at the Grain Bin! We traveled to go to the Omaha Zoo, which was only a 30 minute drive. It was lovely to stay in a private area and walk around the property. The sunsets from atop the hill were breathtaking. Although it was close to the road, you couldn't hear anything from inside. I would recommend bringing an eye mask if you are sensitive to morning light, but was a beautiful place to wake up in! It was so clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"

My wife is a little leery of heights so the stairs were a little intimidating but she got used to it in no time. All in all this was a very peaceful and relaxing stay. We would definitely stay here again if we are back in the area.

Stayed with kids","This place was perfect for our little vacation getaway with the two of us and our 19 month old. My husband has scooped out a lot of grain bins in his day and this was pretty cool to say that we’ve stayed in a legit grain bin house! It was very thought out and modern. We loved the windows and how they kept it a circle shape on the inside! One thing I will say is that the steps are very unique, hard to get used to and very custom-made (which is awesome), but difficult to trust your child going up and down them. The other thing I would say is that there are no shades on any windows, so if you have a child, bring a shade of some sort. Otherwise, they will be up when it’s light out."

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED staying at the grain bin. We came down for a family wedding in Woodbine. The drive back and forth there for the few days we stayed was absolutely beautiful especially for Iowa! 🤪 The grain bin was so gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. My husband and 2 kids loved it as well. We hiked up to the lookout with another family of 4 who was also in town for the wedding. Such a fun and unique stay. Highly recommend if you are looking for a rental in this area! We were not crazy about the eateries in the small town but the kitchen is well equipped so we made a meal for dinner our last night there. The aquatic center in town made for a fun time but the water slide is super slow (also they only take cash so be prepared). Surprised to see that in the town!"

The bin is so cozy and beautiful, we just wanted to soak it in. It was a wonderful two days of relaxation! I booked this as a Christmas present for my husband, but didn't tell him where were going. He was so surprised when we got there and kept saying several times during our stay, ""This place is really pretty cool!"" We'd love to come back sometime.

Close enough to Omaha to enjoy the activities there, but far enough away to truly allow for peace and quiet. It's an accommodation that gives the best of both worlds. Inside is an oasis of comfort and style and outside will put a smile on anyone's face. Every comfort of home and high-end amenities that feel like a luxury hotel. Can't say enough good things and will highly suggest to friends and family who come into town.
Great for a local single or couple looking to getaway from the big city lights, College World Series goers, and those just passing through wanting something special to remember."

Its in a peaceful location with beautiful views out front and tu ked in just under the Loess Hills. We hiked up all three evenings to watch the sunset and it was totally worth it. We used on of the 3 firepits and there were zero issues. The kitchen was well stocked and the living room/bedroom loft were comfortable. Best part of the house...the heated floors in the bathroom. Overall a perfect getaway and I'd happily stay there again!

Though the atmosphere would probably not be one that our family would choose if there were other options just because of our personal preferences, it was a good place for us to stay for a few days while being in Wahoo. It definitely beats the hotel in Wahoo! The beds were very comfortable, the air worked well and the house was nice and cool at night, and the shower was great. We loved being able to sit on the porch and watch the fireflies and our kids really enjoyed the tire swing in the front yard. Bob lives next door and met us outside when we arrived to tell us about the place. We will likely stay again the next time we are in Wahoo."

Stayed with kids","Great place to entertain old friends around a genuine bar environment..however, unless all you plan on eating is your alcohol, youd better bring your own pots/pans/baking sheet/utensils/ silverware/ etc. Cause there wasnt any. We showed up as a family any couldnt cook anything. Also, big surprise, owners live right next door and spend entire evening out on porch which would be fine if there were curtains on any of the windows for privacy but there aren't any. Some of the blinds are tied up in such a way so they wont go down anymore. Place was clean for the most part and looked just like ad, but expect owners stuff to still be in fridge/ freezer and in various places, kinda like owner has his family living there until you show up. Also important to know, if your service animal leaves any hair behind youll be charged additional cleaning.
Otherwise our stay was truly unique and a great experience, my son pretended to be a bar tender for 4 days. Lots of root beer was consumed."

The inn had all the amenities that we needed and the decor was fabulous! We could tell that the owners spent the extra time on the little details that gave it so much character. There is a great walking/biking trail one block from the house that takes you to Lake Wanahoo. Wahoo is a quaint little town, with some of the nicest people we've ever met. We had a great breakfast at the Branding Iron Cafe and stopped at the Wahoo Bakery and had the best kolaches that we've ever had. Thanks for a great weekend! JNoon"

The basement apartment was roomy, clean and well-equipped, and the bed was comfortable and conducive to good sleep. There even was a curved pillow similar to what I use at home to avoid neck pain. The host provided good instructions with the information we needed. The location was excellent in that it was near my husband's Elkhorn office and close enough for him to walk there. While some people might not choose to stay there because the route to the entry at the back of the house involves walking through grass, we had no problem with that and would definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","Cathy was wonderful and communicated clearly, but because of the people renting the downstairs unit, we didn’t feel safe there with our daughters. In the middle of Saturday night, the renter was pounding on our door because he couldn’t get inside of his. My daughter foolishly got out of bed and opened the door to a very drunk male and told him we weren’t the owners. He went away, but within an hour, we were awakened to knocking on both our front door and the back one near the garage as well as ringing of the doorbell. We explain that we didn’t know “Matt” and couldn’t help them. This didn’t stop for almost 30 minutes, so finally I went into the garage to the back door they were pounding on, and found out that Matt had called them for a ride. I didn’t even realize that I had walked right past a passed out Matt on the garage floor, since I was in my pajamas and hadn’t turned the light on. We didn’t go back to sleep and left early the next morning. Scary experience!!"

Stayed a few nights",Cathy is certainly a Super Host! I truly enjoyed the decor and conversation pieces throughout the home. She provides everything you need and more including snacks and everything needed for coffee lovers! I loved her cute coffee bar! Enjoyed drinking coffee and watching the snow from the enclosed back porch. The home is delightful with so many reminders of my childhood!

Is our experience when we stay
Most inviting from day to day
From morning til night, come what may
God's presence from His Word displayed
Sharing Truth with guests who've stayed
Reaching deeply into each heart
Sharing love, our Lord imparts
Attentive to all questions asked
Chris & Cathy take care of tasks
Very helpful and pleasing too
Quite endearing through and through
They provided all we need
Loveliest home, yes indeed
We're quite thankful and really blessed
To stay in your home and be your guests"

The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. We had some trouble opening the front door. It is an older house, so you have to really push on the door to get it to open. If you are bringing your pet, ensure that you specify that very clearly when communicating with the host, and there is a pet cleaning fee."

Stayed with kids","this little gem of a place was perfect for our family of four's visit to my husband's hometown for a reunion and birthday. we were able to spread out between the two generously sized bedrooms, 1.5 baths, spacious kitchen and living area, and back yard. everything was clean and well appointed - super comfy king beds, quality linens, stocked kitchen with plenty of cooking gear, oils and spices, and laundry facilities. the kids were thrilled to be able to watch cartoons on the big screen tvs and slept soundly in this quiet neighborhood. we used the beach towels on trips to Ronin Pool and Fremont Splash Station - highlights of the trip for kids and adults alike (the many lifeguards meant we parents could actually relax!). the kitsch game was strong and i desperately want that '50s snowflake-pattern formica on all my surfaces now."

With all its charm
Delighted were we
We filled it with glee
Pleasing to our eyes
Each day's start at sunrise
Like stepping back in time
All of us did chime
All the love and the care
For each guest was truly there
No detail overlooked
All we needed when we cooked
Many a noteworthy touch
We all enjoyed oh so much
Fireplace included here
Setting vibrant atmosphere
All the comforts of a home
With the Scriptures, we have known
Was a pleasure, blessed to meet
Chris and Cathy, special treat"

It was a clean, comfortable place to be and felt as close to home as it possibly could without actually being at home. It was in a quiet neighborhood and we were able to get good rest. It was kid-friendly and had plenty of space for the kids to play. We weren’t comfortable putting our kids in the basement by themselves since they are young, but we found plenty of soft blankets so they could camp out in the living room. The kids also thought the basket of treats was the greatest. Laura was helpful and quick to respond. This will definitely be where we stay in the future when we go to Wahoo to visit family and I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a place while they are there."

Plenty of space to sleep, but unless the weather is nice there is a limited space on the common areas for a larger group (mainly for dining). However there's also a TON of outdoor space that can be used to spread out (patio with 2 tables, another table on the ground level, on the rooftop by the hot tub). We didn't use the bar area much, but that can serve as separate living quarters for a larger group which has its own entrance and full bath. The pictures do a great job of representing what it's like, but it's better in person. 10/10 stars. Thanks Brian!"

The walk-in wet room was a nice touch, and the tub offered a truly relaxing experience with excellent water pressure and hot water. I highly recommend this home to others!"

Stayed a few nights","A beautiful, tranquil modern oasis. We had a wonderful stay at this container house! The detail and design of this home was outstanding, especially the kitchen, stairway and master bedroom space. Surrounded in trees but close to town. The multilevel deck space was unique and spacious. Didn’t get the chance to utilize the additional lounge space but what a cool bonus space! WiFi is a little tricky but nothing to complain about as it is a steel structure. The details put into this home was purposeful and on point. Had plenty of kitchen utensils but would recommend a few more blankets for the ladies. Definitely a work of art and would stay here again. Thank you for a great weekend with friends."

The host was very kind and went above and beyond to accommodate us after we missed some pieces during our initial booking. This place is a complete 10/10. The house is very well laid out for all to be together, but also provided privacy for everyone as well.
We loved sitting on the top deck watching the stars by the fire making family memories. We shared so many giggles here and highly recommend anyone curious about this place to book. We only left once to visit the De Soto nature refuge ( check it out) otherwise this location has enough to keep your family occupied day and night!
Peaceful lovely stay."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Harmony House for 4 nights in August 2023 and really did not want to leave.  We returned to really nice homes in the suburbs of Houston and suddenly they felt inadequate.  This amazing house is so creative, so filled with light and surrounded by a forest of green, and so full of places to hangout that is truly one-of a-kind.  We took more photographs of the house this trip than of our ourselves and each day we felt privileged that the creative genius who designed and built this house let us stay in it for a few days.  We travel from Wyoming to Vermont to the Blue Hill Mountains and we have never seen or experienced a house like this.  The owner was very attentive and for a couple wanting to get away for a few days, this amazing place is perfect."

Group trip","My sister, two cousins, and I stayed at Harmony House this weekend, and we loved it. It's even better than the photos. The space and decor is beautiful; the grounds are gorgeous. Brian (or someone) obviously put a lot of thought into the design and decor. There are so many places to hang out outside, but we were perfectly content just being on the main deck (and I spent a little time in the hammock), surrounded by nature. Everything about the booking and stay was straightforward and easy. Brian was a suburb host, providing everything we could possibly need: toiletries / towels / cleaners / stocked Keurig machine / etc. etc. The place was very clean. I've stayed in several Airbnbs: this one was PERFECT."

I loved all the amazing houseplants that made the space feel very zen. The house was very clean and all of the provided amenities were of nice quality. Brian was super helpful not only with questions we had about the house but also with giving other recommendations with questions we had about Fort Calhoun in general. There are places to eat nearby and a cute apple orchard where we bought some amazing peaches that I would drive back for. We loved our stay and can’t wait to go back. Thanks Brian!

Stayed with a pet","From the moment we pulled up the driveway and saw the Harmony House, we were awestruck. Upon entering, we were taken into such a beautiful space that it really is hard to describe. It’s more of a feeling, like you can breathe. You can’t get much closer to nature. There are floor to ceiling windows and a large garage door that opens to a huge deck outside the living area.
My husband and I like to stay in different places to have new experiences, and the Harmony House is, by far, the best experience we have had. There is just a calmness that comes over you. If that isn’t enough, it’s so beautiful it’s almost hard to imagine. The craftsmanship is top notch and everything is so well appointed. Brian did an amazing job with the design and building of this house. Brian was an excellent host as well. Communication was there immediately after booking and all of the instructions are easy to follow. Checking in and out were a breeze. I I highly recommend this beautiful treasure in the forest."

Stayed a few nights","The Harmony house hosted a beautiful wedding for me. I reached out to Brian when I first found the house to see if it could accommodate a 25 person, small, private wedding. The home had the perfect setup for a bridal suite upstairs and grooms area below. They have an outdoor area that became a perfect backdrop for the ceremony. We enjoyed a cocktail hour and then dinner hosted on the large patios. The rooftop deck became a beautiful spot for dancing.
Brian and Marcy worked with us to accommodate all of our ideas and put on a wonderful day for us. They provided us with a wedding package in addition to the house to help us prepare for everything and allow our families to enjoy the day. Truly went above and beyond as hosts. My husband and I are looking forward to celebrating future anniversaries here!"

The house itself was amazing and unique. The huge windows, great natural lighting, and indoor water feature really added to our relaxing weekend. The space was also well-stocked with all the basics you need for a weekend getaway. We visited in February, so the trees were leafless, but the natural surroundings still made the home feel nice and secluded (we even saw deer in the wooded area outside)! Definitely plan to come back in some warmer months to take full advantage of the awesome outdoor deck and patio spaces.
Brian was a friendly and super responsive host. We really can’t say enough positive things about our stay here! Would highly recommend!"

On a 40 degree, sunny, calm day, we enjoyed the kayaks and paddleboat on the little lake! We could also enjoy a few games of horseshoes in the yard.
There is a lovely, wooded hiking trail at nearby Hormel Park.
The one downside was the sulphur smell of the well water. We brought drinking water for cooking, coffee, even brushing our teeth.
Would definitely stay again!"

Group trip","This was a great place if you needed to accommodate many people. Dan/his team was very responsive, the pool was fun, the space was unique, the patio was great for the evening and the kitchen had everything you could need.
The cons we found were:
It was kind of dirty. For example, there were some leaves in the entry way that also made their way inside. The dining area wasn’t swept very well. We noticed crumbs/dust bunnies on the carpet and throughout the rooms. Not a big deal, but it looked like it would have been easy to clean prior.
The pool door was hard to open and close. We ended up not using the inside pool door because we couldn’t get it open after a certain amount of times using it.
We wish there was a door for the master bedroom bathroom. It would have been nice to have a bit of privacy since two of the guests shared that room."

We utilized the 4 refrigerators and 3 coffee maker througout the house. The ice maker and blender helped us make fun drinks! This villa has plenty of space to spread out and the two living rooms were great for watching the football games. All TVs are smart TVs and we used the YouTube TV accounts already set up (but we also brought our fire stick). Family karaoke night was a blast! This place is very uniquely decorated with many eclectic features, a mix of industrial, 80/90's modern and updated touches. There are different areas to take photos, it is swanky! The primary bedroom gave off an 80's ""Todd and Margo"" vibe. Everyone slept very well, having 5 comfy king beds was nice. The property is kept very neat and clean."

We did have a few issues with the hot tub being on a timer so you had to go in on a certain schedule and no way to add water. Master Tub out of order and things could have been a little cleaner for the money. Overall it was a great place. I feel like when you are paying top dollar you should expect it to be pretty darn clean.

The hot tub was nice to have and enjoy but only runs jets every four hours for one hour with no schedule and needed manual adding of water every day. Chef's kitchen is nice and a great place for a family of 11 to spread out. Host was very responsive to questions. All the TV you could ask for as host shares major entertainment apps.

Stayed with a pet","Stayed for a week here. Great quiet area. Hot tub available if desired. Pool in summer. Nice owners!
May have been a miss on our part, but this is basically a room and bathroom. All other areas are open to whomever is on property. We didn’t realize that part. It wouldn’t be that bad if there were a private area for paying guests. The kitchen, living and work area are not private. However, the way it’s set up is awesome!! Blackstone grill, stove/oven, microwave, coffee pot, etc. Now we want a Blackstone 😃
The bedroom is just a bed, no chair or bench to put a suitcase & no closet, so you’re living out of your bags/suitcase while you’re there.
Overall, more of a hunting camp type of feel. Gorgeous property!!"

5 stars.
We enjoyed our time at the nest. Everything was clean and tidy and the location was great, right next to the river. Had it not been so windy, it would’ve been perfect! The hot tub was an added bonus we enjoyed even in the cool weather (the provided robes were a nice touch. There was a chance of nasty weather, and we were even provided with an emergency weather radio. Should you decide to stay, the District 10 Schoolhouse Bar is a unique place to visit and enjoy a drink."

We were unsure if this would work since this was a shared space, however, we felt very comfortable and private while visiting. Having the river right there was like staying at a park, which is what we needed. It works well for mild weather months to have outdoor living. The shared space is an open garage setting as pictured with couches and open cooking area which worked well for us. We had a pleasant time."

She stayed up to let us in and give us a tour even tho she had school starting up tomorrow and kids showing up the following day which she had to be up early. She was kind and talked to us and asked about ourselves. The place was beautiful, peaceful and quiet even with two other people staying there and I never saw them only Kathy which amazed me. I was sad I had to leave early as I had a family emergency and had to leave to Missouri immediately:( it was very well priced for such a lovely stay. Thank you again Kathy for all the help and im sure if I got to meet Jim he would have been just as kind. You both have a lovely home and we enjoyed it so much I might have to come back with a S/O it’s a beautiful romantic place as well as homie for a family"

We walked inside to find beautiful flowers from their garden on a table. We were encouraged to pick vegetables that were ready and cut more flowers if we desired. The well stocked refrigerator was the best AirBNB experience thus far. Additionally, the well labeled kitchen area made it easy to find the cooking utensils that we needed. Everything from the inside living areas to the pool and hot tub were pristine and very clean. We enjoyed eating breakfast outside every morning under the covered patio with the amazing view. We look forward to staying at the Nest again in the future."

Stayed with a pet","Clean cozy cabin, great view, and excellent hospitality. The cabin had everything we needed for our stay, the beds were very comfortable, and our two kids loved the loft area to sleep. There was a beautiful view of the river and a great walking path around the property. We had access to fridge, microwave, propane grill/oven/stovetop, which was great so we didn’t have leave to spend money at restaurants. The pool was great too, with no harsh chemicals, it was hard to get the kids out! The fire pit was perfect for making s’mores and relaxing after swimming. Jim and Kathy were kind and friendly, they were available if we had questions or needed anything during our stay. I definitely recommend staying here!"

Very spacious and cozy/homey feel to it! Jan was amazing and was quick to respond if we needed anything and was just so sweet! We will most definitely be staying here again for our other travels out in NE. Very quiet area and not a lot of traffic which is good because we had kids with us! It is a MUST stay here! Couldn't be happier about the place or the price for it!"

Group trip","My family and I were in town for my niece's graduation and stayed here for a week. Jan allowed us to stay with our 2, 1 year old great danes, so long as they were trained and were capable of staying off of the furniture. This of course wasn't an issue for s since we have them trained to behave this way at home. She left clear instructions for everything and the entire house was spotless. I've gone to other Airbnb's and this has not always been the case let me tell you. Upon our arrival back home, we realized that we'd left our FireTv there and Jan was kind enough to put it in the mail for us. She also found some sticky areas in her carpet and instead of freaking out, she kindly reached out and explained the issue. We of course paid for the service to have the carpets cleaned since one of the children must have spilled something. She was very understanding and kind the entire time. There were NO issues at all. The only downside to the location for us is that we're used to delivering in food and that's not an option here since there aren't restaurants near by. This of course isn't Jan's fault, but if you're a Californian like us and are used to this ""luxury"", keep that in mind when staying here. Over all, we felt super comfortable and enjoyed our stay. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to visit my sister in law in Fremont."
