Stayed over a week","Sue's place is perfect for extended stays. It offers all the amenities you require, including a washing machine and dryer. The house has cute patio outside, and it's worth highlighting the amiable neighbors. Overall, the community in Sterling radiates friendliness. The host is exceptionally responsive and consistently ensures our comfort during the stay.
Location:
A mere 4-minute drive is all it takes to access an array of essentials, including supermarkets, restaurants, and cinemas. The location is exceptionally convenient."

It was a very short walk (1.5 blocks) to the Starbucks at the local Safeway, which was highly enjoyable with the beautiful trees and birds singing at sunrise. The downstairs apartment has a specific parking place and a private entrance and a very quiet location.
I highly recommend staying here."

Good wifi, friendly pup, off street parking. It is in a basement, so you'll need to navigate 5 or 6 steps with your belongings, but no problem -just be careful. Would stay again."

Stayed with a pet","Overall, not super impressed with this home in Fort Morgan, Co.
Home was not clean upon arrival: dried urine on the toilet, last tenants personal shampoo left in the shower, dirty/dusty floors, etc.
Some items mentioned in profile were not included/available: coffee, hair dryer, etc.
Projector setup in the main room was not functional and/or was not intuitive to use.
Home is pet friendly with a fenced in backyard, but dog owners beware - the backyard is largely unkept and full of stickers/thorns. Our dog unfortunately got injured by the thorns so we didn’t allow him in the yard.
A couple of the beds were not on bed frames, but rather box springs directly on the floor. Many of the blinds were broken. Siding was falling off the home. Broken outdoor furniture on deck.
Could be a great little stay with some TLC. Owner was very prompt, proactive and a pleasure to work with."

Stayed a few nights","I was not impressed with the house mostly because it was not clean on check in. urine on the floor in the bathroom, dishes in the dishwasher, and dust and dirt on the floor. The bedroom and bathroom downstairs wete not cleaned at all before arrival. Only one bed was made up for use. After speaking with the host I opted to move the bedding to the bed that was actually on a bed frame. While moving the bedding it was obvious that the space between the box spring and the mattress was not clean. I could not get the projector to work. there were no instructions on how to use it. I ended up watching movies on my tablet my whole stay. I cleaned the bathroom, kitchen counter, and put the dishes away that were in the dishwasher. The house has potential to be really cute. My stay was not ideal but it was better than staying in a hotel for a week. The host is responsive and did offer to come back to make the bed but I declined."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was cute. Clearly a lot of effort has been put into restoring the older (1910s?) property. It was nicely decorated with comfortable furniture. Josh left us a lot of snacks, including the proverbial chocolate on the pillow. The soap smelled good and there were a number of different products to choose from. Plenty of extra supplies (paper towels, plastic bags, dish soap, etc.) were provided.
Sterling/NE Colorado isn't exactly a big tourist destination, but we were visiting relatives and explored the town a bit, and this location was within walking distance (less than a mile, with sidewalks the whole way) to all the little shops and cafes.
When we originally made the reservation, we had some questions that Josh answered almost immediately."

Property isn't fully fenced so if you have pets you'll have to walk them on a leash. The unit itself is decent. Comfortable beds and a lot of natural light comes in which was nice.

Good snacks, plenty of bagged ice in freezer upon our arrival. Shawna responded immediately when we requested a pooper scooper. Beds very comfortable. Outside pictures show a very nice house, which it is, but it doesn't show a view from property outward. You are basically surrounded by buildings or privacy fence. But for us, that was fine since we were in the outdoors all day at a hunting lodge running our dogs in a hunt test. But if you are looking for a view in pastureland, this is not for you. They do have an area in back that you park in and is 100% secluded and private with a nice grill and hot tub which I think makes up for lack of view."

I would recommend this place if your looking for little place to get away. Shawna is very responsive and made the process very simple for this first timer.

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay here and the owner has thought of everything to make the stay go smooth. Simple check in and easy parking. Lightning fast Wi-Fi with plenty of bandwidth for HD streaming. The house was more than expected. Large, open areas inside. Spacious bedrooms and comfy beds. Bathroom was clean and fully stocked with everything from towels to toothpaste. Kitchen was stocked with coffee, spices for cooking and bags of ice in the freezer. We were surprised to see a smart tv in every bedroom! The 65"" tv in the living room made for an enjoyable game night on the PS5 and a chill spot for watching march madness. Our pets were allowed to vacation with us and they LOVED the large fenced in yard. The yard was clean and well kept with outdoor seating and swing. Hot tub was a huge perk. Piping hot with powerful jets. The house is tucked ofo of the main road for easy access to town or a quick route to the west to check out the mountains! We look forward to returning!"

Stayed a few nights","Clean, private, and well-furnished place with an amazing hot tub! Shawna is a superhost and very communicative! Everything was well thought out for a comfortable stay. The home is SUPER clean!
Unfortunately none of us in our group found the beds to be very comfortable. The king mattress is super plush with no support whatsoever. The double bed is a memory foam (enough said). The queen bed is firm, and somewhat comfortable but not the best. All seemed to be very cheap beds. The mattress quality would be the biggest area of improvement for an AirBNB at this price point."

I loved the newly remodeled fully stocked kitchen. The sweet treats they left for me were nice to have. You can really tell they are trying to update everything. The owner said that new windows and a Hot Tub are on order. I will definitely be back to enjoy the Hot Tub. The yard was peaceful and very relaxing. I watched them ride their horses that evening. The yard has nice solar lights."

Group trip","the host is generous in the linens, pillows, and towels in the home. the utility room - while the first thing you see when you walk in, along with the furnace & water heater - is big & a great multipurpose room for storing travel things/coolers/shoes/winter clothing, etc. the host is quickly responsive. but this is a double-edged sword as the airbnb and her home shares a sectioned off yard with a privacy fence. she & her family & their employees drive by the house multiple times a day, so the only real privacy is in the airbnb house with the curtains closed. and they make a point of inspecting you if you are in the yard. unfortunately, this was the first time I ever experienced racism, and it came in the form of this type of drive-by inspection and then the host & her husband invading the space we were renting from them. the host also tried to accuse us of damaging the sprinkler system as the irrigation system was programmed to run in the middle of the afternoon - prime time when kids or adults were in the yard; luckily, I am a landscape contractor & know how to inspect a sprinkler system for damage (everything worked fine upon inspection except 1 low-pressure or plugged nozzle, which was not our fault). I visit family in the area multiple times a year; I will not bring my family back to this location to stay; we will find other accommodations."

Stayed about a week","We do an annual hunting trip out near Kimball each year and found Sarah's ABnB when searching for a place to stay. She was very responsive and helpful. The house was great, large living area, full service kitchen, and large garage. She checked in on us via messaging during the trip to make sure we were doing well. Loved this stay and will most likely book it for our trip if we go next year. Thank you Sarah!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my second visit because I loved it so much! It is centrally located to my job sites and easy to get to (electronic maps will lead you astray-go to CR27 and look for the big brown pole barn). Sterling has some good restaurants-Parts & Labor brew pub, The Grill at River City, and others. Check out Mavs at Fort Morgan and Victor's Sushi in Brush. The place itself is peaceful and so quiet I could hear my heart beat. The small airport/landing strip was great! We loved watching the plains. If you are adventurous, Lindsey's dad will take you for a plane ride for a fee (I haven't worked up the courage for that yet) Lindsey is an awesome host!"

Stayed with kids","This was a great stay, but I do want people to be aware of one thing. When it says it has air conditioning, it means there is a wall unit in the main common area. This is obviously only a problem in the hottest times of the year. They supplied a couple floor fans, which helped direct the air to the back bedrooms, but it still was almost too hot at night and there aren’t any ceiling fans. Opening windows wasn’t the best option because a neighboring area had spread manure and at times the stink was overwhelming. The manure is not a criticism, I just like people to know what they are walking into so they can plan properly and be prepared. The host, however, was great, the home was clean and very comfortable. It’s definitely worth booking and I would do it again if we needed to, and would probably plan a stay during the cooler months."

Stayed a few nights",That place needs a lot of work all around the whole house and if you're having people stay even kids or women you might want to put thicker curtains up because that is ridiculous I could see right through those curtains all the way to the street lights out there so if I were to turn on my light someone can see inside I didn't feel like that was safe at all. And I do believe that sewer was backed up because I had a really nasty funky rotten smell in the kitchen. Felt like I was taking advantage of next time you get to any rentals I would go around and check and make sure that everything is good to go before you even think about renting that place

Stayed a few nights","Lindsay and her family were great to work with. It is a bit out of town, but nice to run away to at the end of a long day. Lots of room, big deck for a beautiful breakfast each morning. Views would have been far and wide, and we were there during some bad Colorado fires - Sadly this actually add to the beauty of the sunrise and sunset. Watching the planes take of each morning was exciting, they are little planes so they don't make much noise. It didn't bother me to hear them that early but it did others in the group. We hope to have this event again each year, and if we get it set up I would definitely use this place again for the sleeping arrangements."

The landing strip is close so you get a 615 “wake up call”, if noise bothers you get earplugs. Also the mosquitos were bad so bring bug spray. All in all though I would rent again!!! That is all part of the ambience of living in the country!"

Stayed over a week","The space was clean and the host communicated efficiently at first. After check in as problems arose they were less easy to communicate with.
I’d say this place is great for a short stay or someone who doesn’t mind a louder environment.
I worked night shift and the lack of insulation was a problem for me trying to sleep during the day.
If there was anyone in the room next to me I could hear everything, word for word, as if they were in the same room.
The WiFi was so bad I had to go get a hotspot about it on my phone and when I asked the host about an extender or a suggestion of how to fix it or make it better their response was “this is just the way it is in the town”. So probably not the best place if you need WiFi.
My last complaint that I have is that I (again) could hear everything in the room next to me. As people checked in and out. When they came to clean they badmouthed the guests who had just stayed there. The first time they called this woman foul names and swore up and down about her. The second they badmouthed someone for saying the place wasn’t clean.
I felt this was extremely unprofessional to badmouth guests.
I canceled my reservation early because they would not accept a modification of the dates I had reserved.
I have no doubt that with the behavior I witnessed that I was probably added to the roster of guests that they badmouthed.
I will not stay with them again and I would not recommend it."
