We were hauling a 12 ft trailer and the parking was a pull in half circle . It was easy in and out; we parked right at the front door. Thanks Annette for an excellent experience!

Stayed with kids","Perfect location/great space for our family this past weekend. Loved the multiple rooms/beds to spread out and kitchen has everything you could need. Even had some waters and ice in the freezer for us. Well stocked with Kleenex, toiletries, garbage bags, dish soap etc. It rained quite a bit during our stay so we didn’t get to enjoy the large yard as much as we would’ve liked. Great park and restaurants close by. Easy to get around. It is an older house, as are most in this area, but has a lot of charm! Annette was very helpful and excellent communication."

Stayed one night","I'm sorry just now seeing your text. There are a few things that I would like to speak with you about.
First, we thought that your house was really nice. We really enjoyed how spacious it is. We also liked the fact that you had plenty of towels for us to use.
Second, there are a few things that we think that needs to be addressed that we believe will make it a better experience for your clients. When we arrived at your property the back door was not completely closed and locked. Most importantly and urgent the sliding door would not lock. We tried several times to get it to lock but it wouldn't. There was and issue with the shower in the main bathroom. There is also a gaping hole in the wall next to the sink.
I hope that you don't think that I'm being overly critical I just wanted to offer my feedback. Overall we enjoyed our stay at your property.
Thank you"

Stayed with kids",We really enjoyed staying at Annette’s home. I love the Highland neighborhood being close to almost anything you could want to do in Shreveport/Bossier. The bed in the master bedroom is super comfortable and once you’re in it you’ll never want to leave. All of the instructions were very clear and we were very happy with our stay. We would definitely stay again.

You feel like home when you walk in, no matter the time of day or night, it just feels like you belong there. This particular house is very retro which I love! I rarely leave a review- because they are rarely to the attention and quality of Annette’s homes :) Hope to see you next time!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I are repeat visitors to Shawn's BAFB, close to Hospitals, Broadmore Paradise. First, I want to say that Shawn is the BEST host. He is extremely quick to reply and accept our reservation and is extremely accommodating to our every need.
We feel that this is the JEWEL of Shreveport AIRBNBs. We really rather stay here than any other place. It is in a very quiet neighborhood, but close to everything; behind the main house, and still very private; plenty spacious and has everything we would need.
Everything is neat, clean, and tastefully decorated. The sofa is so comfortable, I wish we had one like it at home.
Since AIRBNB considers anything below 5 stars a bad experience, please always give Shawn a 5-star. It is WELL deserved. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
We definitely plan to stay here again when in Shreveport, if it's available.
THANKS again, Shawn!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I both felt very at home in Shawn's Broadmore Paradise close to Hospitals. First, I want to say that Shawn is wonderful host. He was extremely quick to reply and accept our reservation and was very accommodating to our needs once there.
This JEWEL is in a very quiet neighborhood, but close to everything.
It's behind the main house, but still very private.
There is a nice covered area with patio furniture to sit outside.
It seems like it would feel small inside, but the separate bedroom, bathroom, and laundry room, along with furniture placement throughout makes it this guest house quite spacious... lots of room to move around in the kitchen too.
Everything was neat, clean, and tastefully decorated. The sofa and chairs in the living room were very comfortable. We had Great water pressure and nice HOT water almost immediately in the bathroom. We slept deeply in the quiet, dark bedroom.
If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
We definitely plan to stay here again."

His home is very clean, cozy and accomodating. He keeps it well stocked with all that you could possibly need. The neighborhood is beatifully lined with trees, yards are well groomed and the peace that you feel when entering and leaving the property is wonderful. The location is great and close to everything.

Stayed over a week","Review from a traveling nurse who frequents many places: This is a great little place to stay. Very safe, quiet, and clean! The hosts focused their attention on all the right things to make my stay comfortable. The mattress was high quality as well as the linens. Kitchen was well equipped and they even had coffee, cream and sugar for the Keurig waiting. Perfect touch! Highlight of my stay, being an avid golfer, was that it is butted up next to a golf course and every morning and evening I would gather balls in the yard!! It was like an Easter egg hunt and I have some great Taylormades, and Calloway’s that should get me through the summer!!"

Stayed a few nights","This host’s place is a successful garage renovation turned into a clean and thoughtfully decorated one bedroom bungalow. It is situated behind his nicely landscaped home. I must warn you that the host must invest in a actual mattress in the bedroom. The hard foam left my body numb and my back in knots. I thought my son booked 1 day, to find out I had to stay two days, I almost cried. I paid higher than average housekeeping fees thinking it would add convenience to our checkout. Upon check out we were asked by the host to remove bedding, bring garbage to his curbside, clean this and clean that. Him giving us NEW house rules to do the job of a housekeeper is when I realized his housekeeping fee was a sham. Just a heads up there is no dishwasher and the Ice Machine on the fridge is broken. He also texted us “Don’t leave anything behind as I will not be returned it to you.” This was undiscerning. You will NEVER get repeat guests with an attitude of Ray Liotta in Goodfellas the movie, “F you pay me.” This is NOT what I have come to expect from any Airbnb host. This is not what the Airbnb community is about!"

The interior appears to be brand-new! Beautifully decorated, spacious, and equipped with everything you might need. I appreciated the fluffy white towels, the thoughtful touches in the kitchen, and the tasteful decor throughout the place. The bed is super-comfortable, with high-quality linens - I slept great! Everything in Shawn’s place was spotlessly clean, which I really appreciated traveling at this time.
Shawn was a perfect host, always quick to answer any questions I had. I hope to stay again, and I highly recommend!!! Thanks, Shawn!"

I loved the extra touches such as water bottles in the fridge and a tide pod to wash clothes. Lauren even gave me more water bottles half way thru the week which was amazing. Finally, the surrounding neighborhood was beautiful to walk around in and stretch the legs. When I return to the area I will definitely stay again."

It is a very cute little spot in the host's backyard complete with all the amenities you could possibly need including washer & drier. They had a lovely pool available though it rained almost the whole time we stayed, but would have loved the opportunity to swim otherwise. Spoke with the host, Grant, a little bit before we left and he was very friendly. The location is very cozy and fun. There were lots of good recommendations for food and other fun activities. I would definitely recommend this spot to a friend and if I'm ever back in town I would be very happy to stay with this airbnb again."

If my son were still going to Centenary, it would have been the perfect place to stay—the campus is an easy walk. I appreciated the host’s responsiveness to a small need and his communication. I will definitely return on my next visit to Shreveport"

They knew I was here to test and stocked the area with lots of Tim Horton coffee, (only the very best!) and I took full advantage…it’s what kept me awake:)
Thank you for hosting me, and being so responsive to all my questions. The bed was comfy, the place was spotless, and it was a nice little retreat away from home:)"

Stayed a few nights","Grant & Lauren's place reminded me of a Hawaiian garden with tropical plants (i.e. guava tree, banana palms, etc), & private swimming pool. I swam every morning. The water was the perfect temperature. Even had pool inflatables on request. The flamingo🦩 was my favorite. The place was so peaceful & quiet. The washer/dryer combo was really handy before packing up. Would love to stay there again if the opportunity comes up. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Stayed a few nights","Grant and Lauren were very responsive! Their little cottage was fantastic for an easy get away. The location is nested about 10-15 minutes from anything you’d like to do in Shreveport. Their backyard/pool area seemed very peaceful, I would have sat out there if it hadn’t been 100+ degrees out. Pool looked very clean, they offered complimentary body soap bars, wash pods for laundry and coffee k-cups and creamer. I would absolutely recommend it. I actually ran into Grant in the backyard as well as his two pups and the pups were well behaved and Grant was an easy to talk to host. 10/10 would recommend for a weekend trip or even an extended get away. From what I understand, the cottage is also cleaned by a professional cleaning service! Just book it and enjoy yourself!"

Last night my power went out and grant immediately came over with water, lights and snacks offering his own amenities while the storm happened. They were incredibly sweet and respectful to me having a service animal! The location is quiet, gorgeous and close to all the local attractions you could want in Shreveport! The mini kitchen is stocked with many appliances and a small variety of cups, silver ware, plates as well as laundry supplies for in house washer and dryer. Lastly I ended up staying a day later and they were more than happy to accept me for a last minute rebooking with no issues!
If you’re in the area highly recommend grant and Lauren’s quaint but cozy cottage!!"

There was only one issue, and it was with the bed. The mattress sinks into the middle. If you come alone it won't be a problem, and probably won't even be noticeable. However, if you're coming as a couple you will find yourself to be a bit cozier than maybe you expected 😉. Other than that I would give this cottage 5 stars, and yes we would not hesitate to return."

We really enjoyed our stay and the instructions were easy and access was simple. The only downside to the room was the bed. My honey and I are 230 and 275 so the middle of then bed dipped down extremely too low for our comfort level. Luckily I had a huge oversized pillow that we were able to place under the mattress in order to keep us from dipping down so low. This was something we did not communicate to the owners because unless they were going to give us another mattress it would have been nothing they would have been able to do

Stayed one night","This was my second stay at this quaint backyard cottage. The actual cottage is pretty bare bones. There is coffee and a mini fridge. There is a great TV and a comfy bed. An unexpected little bonus is that this tiny gem holds a washer/dryer. But the real treat is when you step outside the cottage into the back yard. I was in town for work, and sitting with my feet in the pool at the end of a long day was quite restorative. The back yard is a little oasis for the travel weary. Great stay! HIGHLY recommend."

The bed was so comfortable. Hot shower felt amazing after a sit in the spa. So quiet and relaxing. I loved having the ability to do a load of laundry!
My husband used the desk space to work remotely. Wifi was great. Owners were prompt, helpful and friendly when we asked for recommendations for food and grocery stores in the area.
We have stayed in many Airbnbs over the years, and this was one of our favorites. No complaints. Will definitely stay here again when in the area. Five stars across the board."

It had a fresh scent whenever we walked through the door. The extra amenities such as coffee supplies, pantry items, and even bathroom spray were a nice surprise and very much appreciated. The complimentary bottles of water in the 'frig were a great welcome after a long day of traveling to Shreveport. The fenced-in backyard was maintained well and the deck big enough for four adults to hang out on and enjoy the weather. I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area. I highly recommend a stay at Margie's place."

Stayed a few nights","I wish we had found this place when our son was a freshman and stayed here for the entire four years he has been at Centenary. But we did find this gem of a place and have been fortunate to have stayed here for the last two years of his college journey. We love the location to Centenary and SheHee (baseball field) Stadium. Margie, Tim, and Pam are great hosts. They are super helpful and so responsive and accommodating. I travel for a living and to come into a place that feels like a home not a sterile environment or hotel is such a pleasure. We will miss our frequent trips and stays to Shreveport and this lovely home, but do plan to book it for our son's annual alumni baseball golf tournament and baseball game in the fall."

We only stayed one night but I could imagine staying there longer and having a great experience. The neighborhood is very cute and all the neighbors we met were friendly and welcoming. The fenced in yard felt private and safe for the kiddos. I would absolutely stay there again if passing through the area and would highly recommend to friends. The place felt like a deal for the price. The hosts were responsive through the whole time we stayed there and made sure we had an easy and simple check in and checkout.

The stairs were a little intimidating, but then we learned that not only is this property beautiful, but accessible! My sister is disabled and was very pleased that she could comfortably and safely move around the home. All of the bathrooms were wonderful and bedroom As soon as we arrived, we started planning our return. The perfect weather, this home was perfect.

Group trip","Beautiful lake home in a safe and beautiful neighborhood. I visit Shreveport often for work and this is by far the best home I have stayed in. VERY spacious, top of the line appliances, quality linens. Oh and I must add…. A master bath and closet to die for!
I can sum it up in one word…. PERFECT!
You will not be disappointed with this home choice."

This is our family's second year staying here. This house comfortably accomodates our two families (one with young children, the other with grown children) as well as hosting our in town family. The spacious kitchen and dining area is perfect for preparing and enjoying meals together. Our family enjoys the deck and dock for spending time together and taking in the beautiful views of Cross Lake. We're counting down the days until our next stay!"

Plus sized kitchen and equipment allowed for large family meal preparation as well as a large dining table to gather around. Dock was in good condition allowing us to store both a ski boat and pontoon onsite for great convenience. Large parking area to store boat trailer and multiple vehicles. Great host who made sure our needs were met and that we enjoyed our stay.

Stayed with kids","This place was beautiful. Waking up to the water in the morning and falling asleep to the sound of the waves hitting against the rocks has to be the most peaceful house I have ever stayed in. Every room had a bedroom and an extra pull out in each rooms. Even though we most of our own things their were enough: blankets, towels, tissue, trash bags, paper towels for everyone in the house. The kitchen was huge, which encouraged us to cook all our meal excepts one. The only issue we had was the bugs, but once we learned that you keep the lights off in the door way area the bugs were less of an issue. The place was sparkly cleaning. The back yard was biggest enough for 10+ to have a water balloon and gun fight. We were not able to catch and fish but we do know their are some fish that can be caught right off the dock, which my son enjoy doing every morning. Overall their is a lot of space in this home"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the grill was in really bad shape (not usable in my opinion) there were a few door issues and the A/C went out on us on a really hot day. With that being said the host was really quick getting someone out to fix the A/C and we were aware of the door issues after we arrived. If those few things are fixed, this place is truly perfect. Great views and location. Clean and stylish house."

What is it about looking over a body of water that’s so soothing to the soul? The house itself = CLASSY. Simple, uncluttered lines and design. The amenities inside the house = PRIMO. The ice machine that provides “Sonic ice” was a huge hit with kids and adults alike. Also liked that bedrooms were on three different levels. Seemed to give everyone a little more privacy.

Stayed one night","Shreveport is a hard area to find good lodging, so I like to think I had realistic expectations going into our stay. Brent was great with communicating, and his instructions were spot on. With that said, I did not find the unit worthy of the price. It was not clean. The baseboards were lined with dust; the floor was dirty, and I’m pretty sure the bed linens were not clean. The shower rod downstairs was diagonal and falling off the wall. I had to fix it. When my wife finished showering, she dried off and a few long hairs rubbed from the towel onto her. It looks like someone renovated the place with their eyes closed. The paint is peeling off the walls in multiple places; the place smelled like mold, and the water faucets are wonky. The good news is the ceiling fans worked, and the water was hot. My advice is simply to never stay in Shreveport."

I would absolutely recommend staying here! Brent was responsive and a gracious host! His communication and precise instructions just made everything easy and stress free.

All the bedrooms was nice and accommodate my party it was more then enough room everything was clean he had all the essentials we needed I even washed some of the towels fold them and put them back lol
The pots looked a Little old maybe it's time to get some more last but not least I asked Brent was it possible to do a late check and he figured some things out and let us check out late and I thank you for that I definitely will be booking with you again😊 5 out 5"

So I wanted few day getaway with kids for Spring Break. Ask my aunt to book room & I let her talk me into Airbnb & I’m so glad she did. Traveling with kids I was really unsure about not being in hotel but was sold on the fact Airbnb would be like home. My first experience was eased by Brent’s place & more so when met Brent. Everything was as listed and was very clean, fresh & homely. No problem with anything parking was great & Brent communication skills are AMAZING!! Thanks for a wonderful first Airbnb experience & many more to come. Look forward for next trip & hope your available to host again."

Stayed a few nights","I polled my brother, sister, and brother-in-law and tried to compile a review. Everyone was very happy with our stay especially since we were all new to AirBnd.
""I think it was great. When I couldn't get in on the 1st day, he took care of the problem even before I could call him. He responded quickly to every one of your questions and request on how to fix things (i.e. tv channel access). Loved all the extras that were provided. From popcorn and coffee to cleaning supplies and kitchen utensils.
It would have been nice to have access to local stations though (esp for local news and for pro football fans).""
To conclude: The property was spotless. The neighborhood was relatively quiet and felt safe. Wifi was available so that I was able to do some personal work after enjoying the holiday. This location gave everyone in my group a room with a TV set for personal viewing in addition to the large TV in the den. Our host was available to answer questions over a holiday weekend."

Stayed a few nights","The Red house was beautiful, even better than pictured. We truly felt like we were staying with friends. Really, a fisherman's dream...Kayaks, the use of Buzz & family's private peer and outdoor kitchen. Lots of thoughtful touches. Snacks in the pantry and breakfast in the fridge because we arrived late in the evening.
My husband lost his wallet and Buzz's son went out of his way to dive off the peer for it. This family and this place seems like one in a million.
Tips for out of towers:
If you are visiting from out of state like us, Tubbs Hardware in Bossier for souvenirs. Special order a King cake from a Bakery beforehand if you want one to take back with you.
There is no bad food here.
Bossier City was the better choice when we were out wandering and didn't know our way around well."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a hidden gem. Great retreat for couples looking to relax and unwind. Very spacious inside and out, not to mention this place was very clean. We did not use the outdoor kitchen, but it was a very inviting area and would love to next time. We caught several fish from the dock and enjoyed the swings located on the dock. This placed is equipped with everything you need to enjoy your stay. There are so many unique features about this venue to even list. You will not be disappointed. This place has character, charm, privacy, beautiful view of the lake right from your back porch."

Buz, the host, is such a kind man & has really created such a peaceful place to share with others. We are so thankful that he allowed us to have a very small & intimate wedding ceremony in the backyard by the lake. It was absolutely perfect, and the views of the water were the best backdrop and didn’t require any added decorations. We caught some fish off the pier. Had the best shower of our lives with the rain-style shower head. Buz has recently added an outdoor kitchen & pavilion, and although we didn’t use it, it is such a nice added touch for any guests to use. It is so peaceful, yet continently located to town where there are many things to do or places to eat if you choose to leave. I’m so glad I found this hidden gem, and cannot wait to go back someday."

He made sure that we had everything we needed and more, offering food and beverages for his guests. The place is beautiful and the scenery is even better at night watching the waves. Many outdoor activities to do as well, including kayaking on the lake! Also very safe neighborhood, would recommend to anyone looking for a getaway!"

The history behind this gem is endearing and just adds to the charm. The lake is lovely and oh-you can walk barefoot throughout the lush grass in the expansive yard and enjoy the breeze on the patio, after catching catfish off of the bank!

Stayed a few nights",My husband and I wanted to get away for a couple of days and found the cabin Buz has listed on Airbnb. We loved that it was on a lake and offered us use of their kayaks and canoe. We were also impressed with so many good reviews regarding his place. So we booked it and found that the reviews were true. It was a very peaceful and quiet place. We tried our hand at fishing and enjoyed a canoe ride. Buz was readily available when we had a question or needed help but wasn’t intrusive with our privacy. And the kitchen was stocked with many extras you may not find elsewhere. We highly recommend it!

We were in town for a very hectic long weekend, but the time we got to spend at the house and on the lake left us recharged! Towards the end of the trip we had the chance to meet Buz and the dogs.

The cabin was clean and wonderfully decorated and the bed was incredibly comfortable.

As specified in description the water is accessible by a small walk which was perfect to wear my kids out. If you’re wanting to cook larger meals here you may need to grab extra pots and pans which wasn’t an issue because we just had family bring some over, but for small meals everything in kitchen was perfect for that!

Stayed with kids","I had a wonderful time at Oren's location. The home was clean and well maintained. The home was fully stocked with linens, cookware and supplies needed during our stay. It's a peaceful, spacious, country setting complete with a local rooster crowing in the distance (which tickled my 12 year old niece who'd only heard a rooster crow ""on TV"" :-) The only issue was that it is not on a lake or have a lake view as I'd hoped, but we pivoted and drove about 30 minutes to tour and view Caddo Lake State Park. There are beautiful views of water bodies driving to this location, but if your goal is to sit in the back yard and fish or view water, you won't be able to do so here. But, again, there are water bodies within walking distance of the home, and Richard Fleming State Park is about a mile away; we visited each but chose to travel to Caddo Lake State Park because of the views it offered. Nevertheless, I would stay here again, and Oren truly deserves to be a Super Host, he was great!"

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful home but that’s about it. Nothing much to do for entertainment. Would recommend board games, cornhole, darts, etc. The property lines can be confusing and the lake is pretty far from the house.
House looks bigger in photos. Video cameras provide very little privacy as well as the many windows with no curtains (even in the shower). Coffee maker was missing when we got there and there was dirty laundry in the washer and dishes in the dishwasher. Just expected better for the price of the place. :( disappointing"

Stayed with a pet","Oren’s place was perfect! Very clean and the beds we’re comfortable. Oren was very responsive with any questions we had. We brought our bass boat but due to weather we were able to spend much time in the lake. Although, we did catch catfish down by the fire pit. If we come back to this lake, we will definitely see if this place is available!"

Stayed a few nights",A fantastic stay with a beautifully remodeled home. Loved the privacy and the short walk to a pleasant and peaceful lake view. A definite unique and serene surrounding. Can’t wait to return and take another couple or grandkids. I would highly recommend this location as it is close enough to activity if you want and far enough away to feel like your away from it all. And the hot tub is an amazing addition to this stay.

Stayed a few nights","I live in Norway so I was looking for a place to gather my family and enjoy ourselves. We enjoyed this place so much. I got to have all 6 of us for dinner. We fit around the kitchen bar, no problem.
I got to spend a very peaceful few days with just my sister. I woke up to birdsong for the first time in a long time. I sat and watched the sunset over the lake and had a drink in the hot tub.
I told my husband anytime we visit we will stay here, fantastic house and a fantastic experience."

Stayed a few nights",Oren was a fantastic host. He gave recommendations on food places to fish. He was willing to do anything to help and provide what we needed. Definitely worth the stay! Will be back!
