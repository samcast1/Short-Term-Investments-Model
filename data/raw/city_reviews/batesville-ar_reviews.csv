They made some renovations since the last time we stayed here that just made us love the place more. If you are looking for a cozy place to relax away from home, Melissa and the Rockhouse Cottage will not disappoint."

We think it may have been birds on the roof and side of the house. This is a good place to stay if you want to be near Batesville without being directly in the city. There was a good view of the stars.

Stayed over a week","I stayed at the Rockhouse Cottage for 3 months and it really started to feel like home away from home. When I checked in, everything was clean and the heater was on, Thank you ( it was 28°at the time 😅)! It is a cozy little atmosphere, very nicely decorated. Wifi is great and the tv has a ton of apps. It has everything you may need for cooking, laundry, and cleaning. My pup and I loved the big yard, especially when it snowed. I felt safe when a few storms came through the area and we never lost power. Melissa was very responsive whenever I needed to ask her something and always seemed willing to help. I would definitely recommend this location to others who are interested in the Batesville area! And I would stay here again ❤️"

The house was neat and tidy, the beds were comfortable, and this little house sets outside of town so you have some privacy and quiet, but close enough to town to be convenient for shopping in the little shops down town and any other activities there.
I would definitely stay here again without hesitation."

The space is very cozy and clean. I had everything I needed to cook meals as well! Another thing to note is how well I slept - the bed I used was SO comfortable. Overall a great experience and will 10/10 be staying here again when I need to travel to Batesville for school!

The house across the street is very cluttered and it did have a smell outside on certain days- so I’m not sure where that comes from I figure the home across the street. The area is flat and easy to find. The house had a lot of amenities and the rooms are nice sizes. There was one chair that said it was broken. The house had a day bed in the the back room with nice lighting. I would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I’d like to say that we were in town for a family member that was at the medical center. We had to extend our stay and with the expense of the local hotels and having no kitchen we decided to look at Air BnB’s in the area. We fortunately stumbled upon this gem which was a god sent because it accommodated us in every way and allowed us the opportunity to relax during this stressful time. The house was very clean and charming and everything was well thought out. We loved having a cozy cottage to call our own for a short period and it provided all the comforts of home. The towels were fluffy and the down blankets made for a well restful night. One of the biggest accommodations was the washer and dryer which allowed everyone to wash their clothes because of our unexpected extended stay. Communication with the host was great, and he even checked in on us, as we were there during the recent ice storm. The cottage beats any hotels in Batesville, hands down and we will definitely book again if we find ourselves there again."

Stayed with a pet","My sister and I very much enjoyed are stay were thrilled to find somewhere to stay that accepted dogs and had the fenced in backyard.
However, I would not recommend it to seniors with mobility issues. While the clawfoot tub was beautiful, I did not feel secure standing to shower in it as no non-slip mat was provided, and it was very slippery. It was also difficult entering and exiting through the back entrance because the storm door did not open fully and the steps were steep and shallow, not to code. The front door was not accessible to us and no key was left for it. Our host left some written instructions saying the TV was not on cable but was connected to wi-fi, we couldn't figure out the remotes so never used the TV's."

The cabin was in a private area up on a hill, but the host was close enough that if we needed anything, they would be right there. The kitchen had everything we needed. Our GPS did send us to the wrong location, a few houses down, and the driveway was hard to see, but we figured it out quickly. Other than that, the place was perfect! We will definitely stay here again next time we visit the area."

Stayed a few nights","Incredible stay for such a good price. Jonathan was accommodating and thoughtful. He offered to allow me check in early, stocked extra firewood, and started a fire so the cabin would be warm when I got there.. even hand delivered more fire starters later in case I needed them. House was squeaky clean and had a cozy, homey feel at the same time. The hosts go out of their way to be available if needed, while also affording their guests plenty of privacy. Sitting on the porch swing and enjoying the peace and quiet was one of my favorite things (out of many) about this stay. I genuinely can’t say enough about this location; it was easily one of the best I’ve stayed at. I’ll be staying again next time I’m in the area.. thanks for the fantastic experience!"

Johnathan was very accommodating and an overall great host. the cabin is gorgeous and private and peaceful. internet connection was not very good but the location made us not even miss it! we stayed in mid to late fall and Johnathan had a fire started before we showed up to get the chill out of the air, he even brought us a baking dish and left it on the counter when we asked if it was available in the cabin. We definitely plan on returning and are very thankful for the time we were fortunate to spend in this lovely place."

(Also has plenty of heaters and a wood burning fire place for the cold winter nights) I highly recommend this place for a weekend in the mountains or a longer trip you won’t be disappointed! Only down side is no Wi-Fi and with T-mobile and Verizon reception is spotty. Not really a big down side when on vacation but just make sure to finalize any calls or emails/texts while in town!

Stayed with kids","This place is absolutely a dime. The outside is amazing with a huge yards and huge patio. The patio has a swing, two rocking chairs and a additional chair. A very nice fire place and even comes with a smoker for you cooks out there. The inside was extremely clean. Beyond words and for the price you would expect something to say negative but there was literally nothing wrong. There is no cell service or internet but who needs that when you can enjoy family time and time away from reality for a night or two. Thank you guys so much."

Cell service is spot, and no tv service (but tons of DVDs to watch). Spotlessly clean. For the price, you can't beat it. Sitting on the amazing front porch with a book and a cup of coffee was the most relaxing and peaceful time I've had in months."

Stayed a few nights","We loved the location of this little cabin, the steep driveway is worth it, the view is outstanding. The inside is nice and cozy, the living area is large and open, with a full kitchen setup, towels were provided and everything was decorated with cozy Arkansas inspired touches. Jonathan responded as quickly as he received our messages, as there is limited cell signal we sometimes waited until town to text. The Batesville Walmart was about a 15 to 20 minute drive away for supplies and food, we went hiking in the Ozarks and stopped at several ghost town‘s and it only took two hours to drive there and back making it a nice day trip during our stay. The wood-burning stove was one of our favorite features and he kindly provided everything we needed to run it.We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area."

Stayed a few nights","When driving up the night of check in, we were welcomed to a beautiful, cozy cabin up on a hill in the middle of nowhere. Upon waking in, a smell & a sense of “I’m home” slaps you in the face. The cabin was extremely clean & tastefully decorated. When we laid down the bed was very comfy, if you like a firmer bed. The place has every amenity that you will need if you want a secluded, romantic or family getaway. There is no internet or cable but that is what we were wanting & it fit us perfectly. There was plenty of firewood for a cozy fire inside the fireplace or outside in the fire pit. The fire pit was the perfect set up to make s’mores or roast hotdogs. The charcoal grill is great for any of your outdoor cooking, just be sure to pack the charcoal. There is a swing and rocking chairs for enjoying the porch with your morning coffee. We enjoyed all the wildlife around the area, from deer behind the cabin to the birds & squirrels eating right in front of the porch. Jonathan was a super host making sure we had everything we needed and made us feel right at home. We will definitely be back for a longer trip."

You won’t have cell phone reception, which was perfect for us. The place itself is stylish with an outdoorsy feel. I highly recommend this space if you want to hang out and listen to the crickets, sit by the camp fire, read a book on the front porch, or cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie. Couldn’t have asked for a better place and we will be back!"

We were only a couple minutes walk from plenty of great restaurants in the middle of town, and all the boutique stores Batesville has to offer.
There was plenty of parking, loads of space inside with a well equipped kitchen. The lounge and dining room was all a nice open floor plan and was all very well decorated. The kids loved their bunk beds and there was plenty of room for us to spread out, and have our own space.
The apartment building itself is very memorable - it's an old stone commercial building that looks out across the giant retro Coca-Cola sign, which was a very nice touch! It was very modern, clean and spacious and we look forward to visiting again next time we're in town."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is in a great location and parking was not an issue. It’s modern, and the decor is very nice.
With that being said, I wish I knew just how inaccessible it is for anyone who cannot walk or climb stairs well. My daughter has a broken foot, so she wears a boot and could not navigate the stairs without a lot of help. The stairs are quite steep with one rail for assistance. The other option would have been to park in the back and have her walk down the drive to the back door. However, we did not feel safe parking in the back as it was quite dark. There was also a car that parked in the back with their lights on for over an hour— the lights shone through the kitchen window, and whoever it was never exited their car. Needless to say, it was jarring.
The function of the living room does not meet the form. It’s beautifully done, but the television is mounted on the wall with a cabinet in front of it. The television’s sensor is covered by the cabinet, so one has to stand and angle the remote to turn the volume up or for any other function for the TV itself. There are also two seemingly pointless armchairs facing the couch which must be moved to the side to allow view.
The kitchen is absolutely wonderful.
The bed area is also beautiful but difficult to navigate. The end of the bed is less than two feet from the wall, so I frequently hit my shin on the bed while attempting to dodge the mounted television. The bed was also incredibly uncomfortable.
It honestly irks me to criticize such a beautiful area, but I wish I had known these things before booking. I would have chose another space."

Two large televisions provide a variety of viewing choices. The kitchen is fully equipped for preparing meals or snacks on the go. A washer and dryer is available inside the closet. There are cute shops/eateries just outside the front door up and down the main street area where the apartment is located. There are parking opportunities both in front of (stairs down to apartment) and behind (flat, direct entry) the unit. Definitely a unique property!"

Very stylish, with many nice touches (sound machine, washer/dryer, all kitchen utensils stocked). You'll enjoying resting at the Hideaway!

Stayed a few nights","Overall, 10/10 for our stay! Jerry was quick to respond and very helpful. The property was beautiful and the views of the lake were incredible. We spent most of our time on the deck enjoying the view and the sounds of nature. I only had one small disappointment with the property. The walk way did not go all the way to the water and the bank of the river was not where we could get to the water for fishing. Not a deal breaker though! Highly recommend this property!"

Full sun at around 9am till 4pm. The pool deck was perfect to lounge on during the day and have lunch outside. We also loved exploring the different waterfalls that came down to the pool. It was a dream. The only thing we didn’t like was having to leave! We will definitely book again. Donald and Shelia were excellent hosts!

We ate meals outside on the covered deck. There is a propane grill on the front of the house.
Inside was clean and there’s one private bedroom downstairs. Upstairs loft has two beds and was good for our family."

Our friends were comfortable after getting the thermostat to the right temp - they had to turn it up a little higher than they normally would at night.

Our host was so easy to communicate with and very quick to respond. This home did not disappoint, it met and exceeded our expectations. My family and I are looking forward to the next visit."

She has everything you need and a nice little deck out back for seating when the weather is nice. My go to for deciding if I’ll consider a place is whether someone will return. We have no hesitation and hope it’s available for future trips."

The kitchen has everything you need. The dishes, silverware, pots and pans and everything else I think are brand new. (not garage sale items). Kitchen is updated and very clean and just perfect. The bathroom towels feel like upscale hotel towels. Another plus 2 full size bathrooms. Both with very nice towels. and a decent blow dryer. 2 bedrooms. Both beds very comfortable and with nice sheets. (not the cheap kind that get the little balls on them). Another plus both bedrooms have their own TV and ceiling fans plus an extra floor fan if needed. The laundry room is perfect room to move around and very nice washer and dryer.
All in all I felt like I was at home. I felt safe and really liked the area. Walking distance to main street with alot to do. I will stay here again. Thank you Earline."

The dining room and kitchen are spacious and equipped with everything that we could think of!
The bedrooms were furnished with useful and really nice furniture, and the beds were SO comfortable. The charging stations with plugs and USB ports (also in living room) were so helpful!
The bathrooms were immaculate with plenty of room, it was excellent having two bathrooms.
Lastly, the laundry room was also roomy and had everything needed.
There was also an outdoor sitting area which we did not get to use, but looked very inviting.

A couple of things to note: There is an RV that is also a rental and parked under the carport of the home. The second bedroom is very tiny and the ladder up to the top bunk is not usable because it’s too small of a space to access it.
Overall, we had a really good stay and would happily rent it again!"

Stayed about a week","This quaint rental is the best place to stay in Batesville! I come every 6 months or so and have stayed various places. I was so impressed with the space and amenities! Included is all your bathroom needs - Qtips, cotton balls, extra toothbrushes, face wipes, lotion, shampoo/conditioner, and many more. Oh, and the shower pressure is amazing! The living space has a comfortable couch with a cozy blanket, 2 extra comfy chairs in front of the window, a desk, a small settee table, and a large flat screen TV. It also has a fridge with flavored creamers, a Keurig with all kinds of coffee and apple cider options, hot coco in the drawer, and different teas. The bedroom has a charging station for any brand of electronics you may have on the night stand. So handy! The house is on Main Street which is the cutest road in the city with so much historical magic to it with shopping, food, and coffee (The Pinto is the best). Great for a nice walk! You have a covered parking spot with an enclosed gate - making a secure location for your car on the property. The hosts are accommodating and very nice. You will enjoy your stay!"

We went to see our granddaughter, but she tested positive for covid soon after we arrived and was placed in quarantine. We were enjoying our accommodations so much that we stayed on for a few days. Because of the weather and the quarantine there wasn’t much to do so we spent lots of time sitting at the windows drinking hot beverages provided by our hostess. Lindsey asked several times if we needed anything. I would like to be the visiting Grandma. If we return to Batesville, I hope this home is available. ♥️"

The place was spotless, incredibly spacious (the pictures don't do it justice!) while also cozy and thoughtful. I immediately felt right at home and wish I could've stayed longer to soak up even more of this historical home's sophisticated charm. The desk space was the perfect nook for me to work with a cup of coffee - I wish I could've stayed longer! Lindsey and her family were respectful of my privacy but she checked in periodically (through the app!) to make sure I was comfortable and all my needs were met. Should I ever find myself back in Batesville - I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere other than with this 5 star hostess. THANK YOU!"

After a long, hot hike we got much needed showers with shampoo, conditioner, soap and clean towels provided. We got local tips for great food (we loved the recommended steakhouse) and felt like we were at a movie theatre for the two movies we enjoyed.
