Stayed with kids","We loved our stay! The kids were blown away by all of the Mickey things and carried all of the characters around all weekend. The playroom is a perfect touch for a family friendly rental. Who needs Disney world?!
Having three bedrooms was incredibly convenient as well.
Steve and Charity were both very prompt with responding to any inquiries!
We will be back to the Mickey Mouse House for sure!"

Stayed with kids",My family and I stayed here while we were on our way back from a work trip for myself. While the theme was cool and good for my kids. I felt as though the mattresses were old and not real comfortable. The comforter on the beds seemed to be dingy and I just didn’t feel like I was sleeping in a clean bed. The trundle bed in the far room was also dirty and I had to dust off before putting my kids to bed. The water pressure was also an issue for us. It was not the great and the water seemed to be very hard. The furniture and decorations seemed dusty as well. I was also not a fan of the real feather pillows in the living room area and while we were there the internet was not working and the cell signal was not great in that area either. Overall it was an ok stay but we will likely not stay here again.

If you're looking for a spacious clean relaxing Airbnb this place is perfect for you. Every room corner to corner was clean. The house is decorated with the most beautiful things eye pleasing antiques and gorgeous paintings. It reminded me of an old Victorian style charm. We will definitely be staying there again if ever in the area. Dave was wonderful and very friendly. House was exceptionally clean in all rooms.

Stayed with kids","The House on Moffet is a real gem. The photos don't do it justice. Wonderful, relaxing, cozy, welcoming, comfortable, well-equipped, and a nice eclectic mix of vintage design. Our host David was highly responsive and well-organized. We loved sitting on the porch listening to crickets and frogs at night and watching thunderstorms roll through, as well as cooking family dinners to share at the formal dining table, and relaxing in one of the two living rooms, reading a book and listening to some records (BYO vinyl). The neighborhood is excellent - perfect for morning or evening walks among some of the oldest historic houses in Joplin, and a park right across the street makes it ideal for travelling with kids. If you're around on a Saturday, make sure to hit up Empire Market a few miles away for fresh local produce, meat, and baked goods. The nearby Bruncheonette on Main St is also not to be missed, and only a lovely 15 min walk away. We eagerly await our next opportunity to visit!"

Stayed with kids","This home is beautiful! It is very new and incredibly spacious. The beds are comfortable, and extra linens are provided, which is nice for cool nights. A pack-n-play on site is so handy too. The fully fenced backyard is HUGE. It was so nice to let the kiddos play outside! The table on the patio is really enjoyable. The garage parking is such a nice perk that many AirBnbs don't offer.
Future guests, be sure to bring shampoo and conditioner. The amenities are light; there were only two towels in the large master bathroom, but the washer and dryer on site made that manageable. We did have to wash several dishes prior to any use because unfortunately, a previous guest had put them away dirty. We appreciated having dishwasher soap to make it easy.
Dominic is a great host. He was responsive and helpful! He could not have made checking in and out any simpler, and we were very grateful for the keyless entry. Thanks for a great stay! We would definitely book this place again!"

Stayed with a pet","The positive: The home is clean, has a lot of room, and has beautiful decorations. We loved having access to the huge garage, and we had plenty of room for 3 vehicles (one inside the garage, plus 2 in the wide driveway). The house is perfect for two families - the walls and set up gave all of us full privacy in our sleeping quarters. There is a huge walk-in closet in the master bedroom suite, allowing us to have ample room for all our formal clothes for our daughter's wedding. Plus, it was very nice to have a fenced-in yard for our dog. The bedroom furniture is beautiful.
Would have been nice: To have a full-length mirror, a few more laundry pods, and a couple more trash bags. The kitchen was missing a few things, but Shelly had missing items sent to the house after we called. Note: The master bedroom mattress is firm, which my husband liked, but I had to buy a memory foam topper to get more comfortable. It is also very high, so shorter people may struggle a bit to get into bed."

From the fresh baked cookies and coffee to the fresh clean smell throughout the house. I would for sure book one of her properties in the future.
The only downside I would callout is we did not realize there was a camera in the living room till the night before we left and my son was a little embarrass as he had walked from bathroom to bedroom with no clothes on. I had done the same , I just don’t embarrass easy. He will survive but I just wish it were known and we may have been a little more discreet 😉"

The host was also willing to work with us on a late checkout which was so gracious. A couple minor things like one side of the loveseat didn't recline and there was a small dent in the wall in the master bedroom, and the fenced in yard was pretty spacious but didn't have a door directly to it. Definitely minor things that didn't effect our overall enjoyment. Overall it was just what we were looking for and we will hopefully stay there again on our next visit! ❤️"

Stayed with a pet","We were in town for a family reunion / Christmas celebration. The location was perfect to go between family homes in Webb City and Leawood. Everything was immaculate and all bedding including spreads are cleaned between guests which is important to me. Layout was perfect for hanging out together no matter if you were watching TV, at the dining table, or cooking in the kitchen. The fenced in yard made it easy to give our dog some outside time. The home was beautifully decorated for Christmas providing a tree under which to place our gifts and an electric fireplace to hang our stockings. Shelly was very responsive, helpful and kind. We will stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay at this house. For people looking at the photos of the house it looks much better than what the pictures show on the website. The inside of the house is light and comfortable. One of the best features was the movie screen.
We loved the fenced yard and so did our dog. There was a nice sitting area in the yard.
Remember to bring detergent with you. We forgot. The bedrooms do not have any lamps, which we needed so we picked up a cheap lamp. The floors are hardwood and have a colorful rug that is really attractive in the living room.
Also, remember to put the # sign after the number of the code. We didn't put they were happy to help is figure out what we were doing wrong. We would stay again and recommend this place to others."

Both beds were VERY comfy which is exactly what I look for when booking. The 8 ft fence was fantastic for our fur baby who loved the back yard. Only word of warning for light sleepers is there is a fire house around the corner whose sirens went off multiple times a night. Not the hosts fault at all, just wanted others to know in advance. Thank you so much Emily! We look forward to staying again!"

Stayed with kids","We were babysitting our 5 & 6 year old nephew and niece and thought it would be fun for them to have a sleep away. The thing that caught our eye about the house was the projector and screen - and it was a big hit for the kids! They even slept on the pull-out couch in front of it. The house was very clean and communication was smooth. The house has all you need for a stay but the addition of some ""extra's"" like spare shampoo, salt and pepper, would make it even better and I'm guessing they will come with time. Very private backyard and quiet neighborhood. We had a great stay!"

Stayed with a pet","I recently had surgery at a hospital in Joplin, and I was fortunate enough to stay at this lovely Airbnb. The location couldn't have been more perfect, as it was just a stone's throw away from the hospital.
The host, who went above and beyond to assist us during our stay, made this experience truly exceptional. From offering helpful tips about the local area to ensuring our every need was met, she was a true gem.
The house itself was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. It provided a peaceful and welcoming environment during a challenging time.
I sincerely hope to return to Joplin someday, and if the host will have us again, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here. This Airbnb felt like a home away from home, and I'm grateful for the warm hospitality we received. Highly recommended!"

There was a nice backyard for our dog and felt he was welcomed here . Emily reached out to us a couple of times to ask if we needed anything or had questions.

The house is cute and in a good location. Overall the place seemed clean. The beds were clean and comfortable. The hosts provided enough towels and wash clothes for the weekend.
Cons:
- We found 2 live roaches in the kitchen. 1 on the first night and 1 the morning we checked out. I told the host and they offered no discount or refund, even with no photos.
- There were very large, disgusting crickets in the house. We found them alive in the kitchen and both bedrooms.
- Two of the windows don’t lock. This is a safety issue considering they are all on ground level.
- The deadbolt on the front door is damaged and the portion that turns the deadbolt just falls off in your hand."

Plenty of movies under the tv and plenty of shows available on the tv. The roll-away bed came in handy for us. It was nice to use the sunroom for some extra quiet from the rest of the house. The kitchen was equipped with more than what we needed. The bathroom had great lighting and a handy stool that our kids used! The neighborhood seemed peaceful, safe, and a good location. I was glad to see some of our neighbors working on a house project and another neighbor enjoying outdoors. If we ever take a trip to Joplin again, we will think of Mary’s place. She was a great hostess for us. I wish we could have had her come join us for dinner one night! Thank you!"

The house is in fact very bright and cheery, and also very comfortable and thoughtfully equipped. There are lovely old house touches like the clawfoot tub and more modern conveniences like the white noise makers by the beds. We didn't find anything lacking and when we had a question about the blu-ray we messaged Mary and she responded immediately. And perhaps most importantly we slept very well. We'd be delighted to stay here again the next time we're in Joplin."

Mary's place was lovely - clean, cozy, and comfortable, we had everything we needed to feel at home during our stay. My son loved staying there instead of his dorm or a hotel for a little get-a-away so we could spend time together during my visit from New Jersey.

Mary communicated well and allowed us to arrive a little early. We used the washer/dryer and those worked well. They had guest accounts for various streaming platforms which is nice that we didn’t have to type in all our streaming platform usernames and passwords. Overall, a great stay!"

Air conditioning and heat did great with the crazy spring weather. The bed is firm and comfortable. TV moves out from the wall to change the angle and all that kind of stuff. The Wi-Fi speeds were pretty average, manageable for scrolling social media but probably not fast enough for gaming. All in all, was very impressed with the cleanliness and interior design in this new tiny home. Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","Charity's place was a great place to rest on our journey home. The location was just down the road from Wal-Mart and Pizza Ranch, two of our favorite places! LOL. Both beds were comfortable. The bathroom was well supplied with all the products needed but could use a little fixing, especially the caulk around the bathtub and the vanity sink was not secured to the wall. The living room had plenty of seating, but beware when you sit down...the couches slid across the laminate floor too easily! I thought the little pet bed under the TV was a cute addition....and there was a KC Chief's blanket rolled up if you get a little chilly!! Go Chief's!!! The art pieces that decorated the walls were a unique touch. I hope the artist makes many sales from them! Also, I think this was the first home I've stayed in that had live plants! Way to go, Charity!"

Would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town.

Stayed one night","I will definitely stay at Charity’s Joplin Art House again! It was perfection in a quiet area, just far enough off of I-44 and outside of Joplin to be quasi-rural, yet, within 15-20 minutes of Joplin retail, activities, parks, and restaurants.
Her house and amenities were exactly as shown in photos and listed. Beautiful art hung in every room of the perfectly furnished house. The house was warm and spotless, even after winter-weather pipe troubles and, subsequent, clean up not long before I arrived. Amenities were exactly as listed and convenient to access.
Charity was very personable and communicative, both, proactively and responding to my questions about additional restaurants. Instructions to the property as well as for check-in were detailed for simplicity. She also made sure to remind me of her flexibility with check-in/check-out times then suggested an even later time.
Thank you for the comfortable space and friendly correspondence, Charity!"

It is a terrible hassle to try to find a hotel and get checked in with my Entourage. Charity was an excellent host, warm and responsive, very easy to work with.
I was delighted to discover Charity's beautiful little house! For the price of a hotel room and easy to access with my animals, it was a blessing! The colorful interior and beautiful artwork brought a smile to my face after such a long trip. My furrbabies loved piling into the large pet bed and enjoyed the special treats.
The location is easy to access from the interstate, yet quiet, and there is there is a very beautiful church just across the street.

Stayed with a pet","We were in town for a family event. Most of our family’s hotels were within minutes of our location. There are a multitude of restaurants and coffee spots just a couple of minutes away.
We had dinner at one of Charity’s recommendations, 10 minutes away, and it was terrific. It was a small little restaurant that smokes all their own meats and makes their own pasta. It was delicious.
We brought our dog with us. She really enjoyed the large yard. Charity had a dog bed, toys, and dog treats all waiting for our girl.
There are snacks for everyone else too! The place is not luxurious but it is homey and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and safe.
We would not hesitate to stay again if we visit Joplin in the future."

It was vey cool on the inside with the decor and local art work, very clean and we absolutely loved how dog friendly it was for our pooch. The bed was very comfy with soft linens and we loved being out in the country. We agreed the best part is the host had everything we could have needed- ample snacks, toiletries, easy check in and out, restaurant recommendations and even dog biscuits for the pup after our long drive. So thoughtful! We enjoyed sitting on the patio at night and watched deer. We'd definitely stay here again and are grateful!"

Thanks for everything.

Stayed with a pet","Joplin is a beautiful city and this lovely house is close to many great things that the area has to offer. A huge fenced backyard was wonderful for our Boston Terriers to play in and a great porch to play family games with the kids. The beds were comfy, the area was quiet, and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Joplin with our three teens and our two dogs."

Gary & Jean keep a spotless home with ample kitchen and dining space, and my niece said the wrap around couch was the comfiest in the world :) Our two small dogs couldn’t have been happier bouncing around in the fully fenced & well kept, super safe backyard! Sometimes the nearby area smells like delicious baked goods thanks to the General Mills HQ nearby. We look forward to making this our home base each time we’re in MO.

The dogs give the large, fenced backyard two paws up!!
The beds were very comfortable and the bedrooms were beautifully decorated. The common areas were comfy, spacious, and relaxing. Every room had multiple charging ports and outlets. The washer and dryer and the covered back porch were much appreciated bonuses!

Stayed about a week","I would first like to say, Shelly was absolutely amazing. Her communication was terrific. Before, during, and after our stay, she was very humble, understanding, and such a wonderful host. Our original trip dates changed and Shelly let us change our dates and let us check in early after driving a 19 hour trip from our house to hers. Her house was very simple and reminded me of my own home. We stayed over Christmas and there was a perfect amount of Christmas spirit in the house that we appreciated. The best thing was the 4 inches of snow that fell while staying there and her yard was perfect to get out there and roll around in the snow. We can not wait till we can come back and stay at this little red house. I would recommend anyone to stay at Shelly's house. The house was hands down amazing but Shelly is the reason we will be back because of the wonderful hospitality she showed us. We could not have asked for a better house, host, and trip to Joplin. Can't wait to come back soon."

The Little Red House was perfect for our needs! It was modern, clean and very comfortable! I will stay at one of her homes again on our next trip.

Stayed one night","Super cute, brand new place! Decorated nicely, nice new queen beds, plenty of space and nice new kitchen! I'm not sure how they fit 3 bedrooms in there and still had walking around space and a sectional couch, but they did and it was great! Perfect spot for hanging out with family in town after Thanksgiving dinner. Sofa also reclines. Master bedroom has separate bathroom. Was worried about location since it is on the West side of town (can be sketchy), but it turned out to be one of the new neighborhoods built after tornado, so all new houses. Owner was very nice, do not park more than one car in the back, she will call. Needs the rest of the driveway paved as it is only a parking pad (maybe where a basketball pad used to be?)"

Tim and Sandy were welcoming, warm, proactive, but gave Mom and I plenty of privacy as well. All the instructions were clear, the space was beautiful and comfortable. The hot tub came in so handy after long days of cleaning, organizing, and hauling belongings. We were able to relax together and watch home videos of Dad in the evenings as well. The cinnamon rolls they provided were incredible, along with OJ and milk. They even gifted us prayer stones. Hands down this will be the only place I want to stay when I come to town now, and Mom feels the same. Tim and Sandy are good people who clearly know what they're doing."

The cinnamon rolls and drinks Sandy set out for us were delicious and very thoughtful. The privacy and comfort of the hideaway made it perfect for me and my man to unwind and spend some quality unplugged time together.

The house feels cozy, it has air conditioning in the room and in the living room to be able to control the temperature to your liking. The kitchen was clean and well equipped, it was a pleasure to cook there.
It was the first Airbnb really pet friendly we stayed in. She has a towel to clean her legs, cover on the couch, a vase with treats, lots of garden to explore, my puppy had a great time.
Tim and Sandy are great hosts, quickly answering messages and thinking about the details so that the guest has a good stay.
We loved this Airbnb and already want to come back in summer to enjoy the pool. If we recommend you stay here, you won't regret it."

The property itself is adorable and very private. We kicked back in the cozy hot tub and stargazed while our pup explored the vast land.
The cottage is very inviting, you won’t want to leave. We sure didn’t 🥰

The hot tub was very easy to open and close. It was so relaxing even on a very chilly night.
Thank you for a great stay! Hope to see “the hideaway” again!"

Stayed a few nights",Tim and Sandy were great hosts! The hideaway was very comfortable and we felt very welcomed! The hideaway was even nicely decorated for Christmas which was a very nice touch. My husband and I stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday and were pleasantly surprised by a Thanksgiving dinner provided for us by Tim and Sandy. Thank y'all so much! The deer came to visit us a couple times and we got several visits from a big yellow dog that enjoyed the treats that are already available. We really enjoyed our time at this little pristine hideaway. The hot tub was perfect and so was everything else! Happy holidays Tim and Sandy and we hope you have a very merry Christmas and a wonderful 2024!

With my job and profession I’m very paranoid about where we stay and the safety! This place is safe and perfect! It’s down a gravel road and private but it makes you feel right at home! I highly recommend this place if you’re thinking of staying here! Tim was awesome and even went out of his way to have some drinks for breakfast that he provided us with in the fridge! It’s such a great place and we can’t wait to come back again in the summer to try the pool! The water gets Hot super quick and everything is so clean! Thank you again for having us!

Stayed a few nights","I can sum up The Hideaway with one word...AWESOME! My wife and I stayed here 3 nights for our anniversary getaway and we had an amazing time. We loved the pool and we took many soaks in the hot tub. There is even a short trail that goes all around the property which is great for an evening stroll. The porch was the star of the show as my wife liked to sit out there in the mornings and drink coffee and watch deer eating the corn. We also ate meals on the porch and sat in the cool rockers. When we got there, we had cinnamon rolls from a local bakery waiting for us as well as milk and OJ in the fridge. Tim and Sandy really are incredible hosts and made us feel so welcome on their property. They even opened their garage for us to park in when a storm was coming! The best part is that it feels like you are in the country when in reality you are just a couple minute drive from town. I can't imagine picking a better place for a couples weekend!"

First, I'll start with the hosts, Tim and Sandy. They were absolutely amazing!!! Very communicative, accommodating, and welcoming. Words really cannot describe just how personable and generous they were.
In addition, the cottage itself was beautiful. The area was so quiet and peaceful. The cottage was also very cozy and quaint. It had everything I needed... from the comfortable bed, nice linens, and quality, fresh-smelling towels, everything was wonderful!!
I'd also like to make mention of the pool and hot tub. Both were very clean and a fantastic addition.
I have visited many Airbnb's and the 'Hideaway' has by far been the best. I will definitely make it a point to return, and highly recommend and encourage anyone else considering this property to see for yourself."

The house is ADORABLE, immaculate and beautifully decorated. The host was so accommodating and kind. What really did it for me? The extra touches! The AC was on and a welcoming 70 degrees. A carafe of OJ and milk in the fridge. A snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich in the freezer. Fresh cinnamon rolls. Hot tub turned on and ready to go with a basket of pool towels and romantic candles. They even had all of the grill utensils laid out on the grill in case we were to want to use it! Although we did not cook, I am someone who does so with passion, and I can tell you they have everything you could possibly need to cook a great meal. All of the kitchen utensils, appliances and dishes are top notch. The mattress was so comfortable, not one of the cheap IKEA mattresses. The water pressure is AMAZING. If we are ever back in the area, not only will we stay again, but we will stay much longer!"

We took a walk, grilled some food, and played some board games during the day. Then during the night we had the fire going and made some s’mores and ended the evening soaking in the hot tub with some wine and beer. The hosts are very accommodating and pleasant . Tim was very nice and friendly when showing us the place and Sandy was extremely sweet for the cinnamon rolls and adding extra towels when we thought we were gonna have some guests over. 10/10 recommend the hideaway."

My friend and I decided at the last minute to stay at Tim & Sandy’s hideaway. Tim was immediately responsive. When we arrived (early might I add as they were happy to accommodate) the place was exactly as pictured, super clean and peaceful. Tim was happy to help and show us around and even left cinnamon rolls from a local bakery for breakfast along with OJ & Milk (& even happily gave us a stick of butter we forgot) we grilled, had a fire going all night, soaked in the hot tub, and even walked the path that Tim cut for us along the property line and took in the sunset while walking along the stream. My dog Boomer was happily welcomed and had the time of his life. I could go on and on but I’ll just say, if you’re on the fence about booking this place, JUST DO IT! I can’t wait to come back."

Stayed one night","Tim & Sandy were very accommodating, friendly and gave us a restaurant suggestion (Famos grill), which was fantastic! We were passing through town, after a long camping trip, celebrating our anniversary and wanted something relaxing with a hot tub! We loved the cottage, it was comfy and homey! We will definitely return and will stay longer."

Stayed a few nights","Tim and Sandy’s place was great! It’s well appointed and private, but still a quick drive to Joplin. The hot tub is the icing on the cake!
There was a chance for severe weather during my stay, and Tim graciously offered a spot in his shop to park my new truck. We dodged the storms, but it was a relief to not worry about hail.
I’ll definitely recommend the Hideaway to others. Thanks Tim and Sandy!"

Stayed a few nights","I don’t even know where to start with this review.
First off, if you’re on the fence about booking this place JUST DO IT!! When I tell you I’ve never been, not just surrounded, but completely engulfed in amazing hospitality it’s no exaggeration! Tim & Sandy were absolutely amazing hosts, they were quick to respond & our trip wouldn’t have been as great without their recommendations for absolutely everything. Everything in the home was breathtaking from the views to amenities (I’ve never slept so good)! We loved the privacy & comfort of the location, anything & everything you could ever wish to do is within 15 minutes of this space which made this location right in the sweet spot.
Everything about this last minute trip was perfect. My fiancé & I are already planning our next stay here. Don’t second guess yourself, book this place! From the location to the personal touch from amazing hosts, you won’t regret it. BEST TRIP EVER!"

Stayed a few nights","This was exactly what I was looking for! Wanted to give my wife a a few nights away for her birthday.... Tim & Sandy hit it out of the park! Great communication, cute cute hideaway, and the nicest largest hot tub we've ever encountered. Almost like stepping into another life for a day or so. We'll be back..."

Stayed a few nights","We loved everything about this place: the peace and quiet, the coziness, the cleanliness, and the thoughtful touches like the breakfast Tim left us. Best of all were the hot tub, patio, and back yard -- we saw two deer come right into the yard! Tim was a perfect host and easy to communicate with. Of all the Airbnb's we've stayed in, this is our favorite."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful weekend stay for our anniversary. The Hideaway was immaculate and charming. The first morning we enjoyed a visit from 6 deer just a few yards away from the front door. The second morning, we experienced a beautiful sunrise through the trees at the back of the property.
We also had fun visiting several quality flea markets and antique malls in the surrounding towns.
It was a great visit overall!"

Stayed a few nights","The hideaway was awesome! Tim was very friendly and extremely helpful, we were never in need of anything during our stay. Each morning was like watching an episode of Nature. One morning my wife and I watched eight to ten deer moving through the field and wood line. Then we noticed a doe was injured on her front leg. Next we saw two coyotes following closely behind the deer. We observed them until they were out of sight. I'm not sure what happened after we lost sight of them but it was an awesome experience! We are definitely staying at the hideaway next time. Thank you Tim!"

Our little guy enjoyed looking at the deer that arrived shortly after us. Amazing hosts! The thoughtful extras, from the cinnamon rolls, milk and juice to the dog bones, were great touches. We're already looking forward to planning our next trip!"

Reservation was set on short notice as my family was heading through the area and needed a place to stay for the night and hosts were nothing short of perfect. Tim and Sandy were awesome… accommodating, kind, helpful. You name it. We hope to make this a frequent stop as it is the mid point for our family to meet. Would come here again and again no doubt."

Stayed a few nights","What a place! The perfect little getaway that's still close to town (Joplin and Carthage) but makes you feel like you're remote, nestled in nature. The kitchen is well-equipped, the bed is super comfy, the view from the porch (or the couch) is lovely, and the hot tub is divine. Tim & Sandy provided so many personal touches in this well-appointed space, I felt right at home. And Tim was super responsive with all my questions. I'll bookmark this one, for sure!"
