Stayed a few nights","What's in Ohio? I often asked that, until we stayed here. Urbana is a city of dollhouses. When you're not admiring the sunsets, or the cute town, you can hang back in this cute, comfortable studio.
Some pros:
-The tub, have you ever bathed in a $4k tub? You can here.
-The bed is super comfy, my fiancee wants to know what the pillow brand was.
-The tv- Works great with plenty of apps/easy to use.
-The hosts- They went above and beyond. Super kind, responsive, and generous.
-Murray the orange cat- She runs the Airbnb well, the best greeter you can have.
-The shower- It's like being on MTV Cribs.
Living without a full fridge posed some challenges because we're ice cream junkies, but we were able to fit some in there anyway, so it worked out.
The town is walkable, photogenic, and overall friendly. The lady and selection at The Merchant Shops are outstanding. People in reviews complained about the kids, but we had no trouble with anyone's kids.
We hope to return, and loved our stay"

The state of Ohio chocolates were an extra special touch. And we would have changed our trip plans just to spend one more night there in your beautifully-decorated historic, completely modernized unit. You were easy to communicate with, accessible, and we felt safe and snug as bugs in a rug! We will look for more reasons to visit Urbana, OH!"

Stayed one night","First off, they provided anything I could ever imagine needing (first aid kit, coffee, water, games, and kitchen accommodations for a kitchenette). Secondly, the place was decorated LOVELY. You can tell they spent time, money and thought in every touch. They even provided a cozy robe to wear after my amazing bath experience! To top it all off I had some trouble turning the TV on (it was installing updates that I was unaware of) and asked for help. He left me extra batteries outside the entrance door in the middle of the night. This bungalow was everything I was looking for, for my 1 night stay. They were quiet and I never heard a peep even with them having a small child and dog. I would absolutely book any Airbnb they would have. Thanks Emma & Cory! You guys are really doing it right! ;) 10 stars!!"

The keypad on the door allowed us to come and go easily, and the location was just steps from town. Cory and Emma were very responsive to our questions and were flexible when we had to reschedule at the last minute. The roku tv was great at the end of a busy day, which gave us a variety of choices of movies to watch. We loved the bathrobes, such a classy touch !"

The place is very well-renovated. There are a lot of serious design choices that went into the place and I certainly appreciate that effort.
For the price and location, there’s really no bad thing I can say. I encourage others looking to stay in Urbana to stay here so long as the air circulation thing is figured out."

Stayed one night","So far my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in ! My fiancé and I even talked about coming here to do a little getaway soon and explore the little town since we were here for a wedding so didn’t get to do much exploring. But the venue was very close by to the Airbnb as well as there’s a lot close by to eat which is very accommodating! I love how they showed every detail on their listing for example what the door will look like to get in so you know what house you’re looking for even in the dark!! Also very descriptive on where things are and what they have! The only side comment is maybe having like extra toilet trees for the guests in case they forgot something. My fiancé forgot a toothbrush which is no big deal, I forgot make remover wipes when I swore up and down that I packed them but didn’t want to ruin their nice white towels so I used a tshirt I packed. But seriously this place is so stinking cute I love it. The tub is literally SO relaxing and huge !! Definitely will be back here !! Thanks so much!!!"

If you stay here, you have to eat at Cafe Paradiso. Best food ever. The AirBnB was super clean, super comfortable, exactly as described and pictured. I highly recommend staying here. I will stay here every time I come for the extravaganza!!!"

Stayed with kids","Perfect location for our trip to the cave, young’s dairy, airplane museum & fish farm. The copper soaking tub & bath bombs are a nice extra touch. Great value stay, all the amenities of a hotel at 1/2 the price.
Only downside for us, since this unit is attached to the owners home (separate entrance) you can hear some
Noise from the floor above & under the doors. Having a sound machine provided helps drowning out some of the noise.
Emma’s communication was great. She even allowed our toddler to play in their backyard, which was super helpful.
The airplane cafe was wonderful to eat outside & watch the planes take off & land. Definitely worth checking out. Freshwater fish farm offers some great smoked trout, cheese & wine. Everything you need for a wonderful dinner to bring back to eat at the unit."

Stayed one night","Even though we had to change our reservation around a few times, Cory and his wife were unbelievably accommodating and happy to work with us! We appreciated their fast and consistent communication! The suite was beautiful and so so clean! Everything was thoughtfully organized and ready for us. The “kitchen” area was precious and had everything we needed. The suite was a bit cold when we first arrived, but the space heater they provided kept the room warm throughout our stay. Our only issue was the shower and bathtub were touch and go for us, as a had difficulty getting the hot water to last. The hosts answered questions we had about how to deal with the hot water and how to make it work and checked in on us during our stay. My partner and I look forward to returning when the weather warms up. The bed is like a big marshmallow and we had a great night of sleep. Other than definitely staying in this beautiful suite, my other recommendation would be to go to Teabaggers for lavender lemonade, bubble tea and yummy sandwiches! We loved the quaintness of Urbana and can’t wait to return!"

Stayed one night","Where to begin... from the beautiful little town, down to the small touches like the handmade bath bombs this place is absolutely amazing! The parking is hassle free and there was plenty. When you walk into the foyer area there is plenty of room to hang your coats and leave your shoes (the hosts have also thought of leaving an umbrella in case you decide to take a walk on one of Ohio's not so nice days). When you enter the beautiful room it is absolutely breathtaking. The beaded chandeliers, live plants, and homey touches such as extra blankets and honey sticks for the hot tea you can make in the Keurig are much appreciated. However, the absolute best part of this stay is the show stopping copper tub that fits two comfortably. It is jaw dropping and so relaxing. After a soak in the tub, we recommend a competitive game of Scrabble while enjoying some popcorn provided by the gracious hosts. After that, there is a fantastically comfortable bed where you can enjoy a movie before you drift off to sleep with the provided noise machine. We are so grateful for such a wonderful night away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Our hosts thought of every detail and even were able to give suggestions on local activities to do on the day of our departure. We were so sad to only spend one night but we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough good things about this place! The location was within walking distance to so many cute downtown shops that we were able to explore. The room itself was SUPER clean and comfortable - Everything we needed was provided including dishes, games, snacks, coffee, creamer, water, etc. The bed was actually super comfortable which is hard to come by in many listings. We had just enough space for just the 2 of us. The pictures of the bathroom speak for themselves, but the shower and bathtub were amazing and so relaxing! Besides the space itself, we also had a great experience with the hosts. We actually encountered an issue with our vehicle during our stay, and they were more than willing to pick us up from where we were stranded to bring us back to where we were staying until we figured out what to do. Lastly, the value of this listing is AMAZING. I really appreciated that we weren’t charged several extra fees on top of the listing price - it made our stay very affordable. I wish we could’ve stayed longer, but we will definitely be back! :)"

The owner has dogs and signs posted about security dogs, so I stayed in my car until they came and told me the dogs were friendly. The dogs didn't bother me after the first day, but I would have liked to know they would be greeting me. Additionally, the host was very cagey about the check in code and wouldn't provide it to me until 30 minutes past check in and after multiple messages. I was starting to be become concerned about the ability to enter. After arriving, I realized that wouldn't be a problem because the host's house is on the same property, but I didn't know that going into the situation."

Stayed a few nights","The place is lovely, with peaceful surroundings overlooking a corn field. It was enjoyable to watch the fireflies at night, something we do not have at home. The barn was clean with no traffic noise or neighbors to contend with. The bed was comfy and check- in was easy. Very nice having two bathrooms . The decor was amazing….lots of collectibles and artistic touches everywhere. Beautifully decorated! The barn is quite spacious and the kitchen was stocked with all the cooking supplies one might need. The only downside for us was the alarm system. It started chirping ( similar to a smoke alarm) every single night at 1:45 am. Brittany kindly gave us the access code to disarm it, but unfortunately, it came back on several hours later, every single night, and we had to get up and disarm it again. We didn’t get much sleep. I’m not sure if it was a defective system, an incorrect setting or a low battery…but something was very wrong. Brittany said she is having someone look at it. She has very kindly offered us a free night to compensate for the bother. Thank you. When the alarm is fixed, it would be an awesome place to stay! I do hope it’s fixed quickly so others may enjoy this lovely place."

Stayed a few nights","We did enjoy our stay. The loft is decorated so eclectically, we loved it. The town is wonderful. Our hosts communicated well and were quick to make us happy. They could work on their cleanliness. There was hair on the shower walls and the shower floor was quite grimey looking (unless it is a permanent stain, IDK). The upstairs toilet runs off and on all night and the bathroom doors are terribly squeaky and need to be shut hard, making it impossible to use the bathroom without waking your spouse. The dishes were put away dirty so we had to wash them before and after we used them, the counter tops were full of crumbs and the stove top was quite dirty. There was a spiderweb in the ice dispenser and the fridge froze our fresh veggies and we had to throw them away. The electronics (lamps and TV) are quite difficult to navigate and more instruction would really help."

Nice big kitchen where we could cook our own meals. We just happened to be in town for the home coming parade which came down the street right in front of the house. We were able to sit on the porch to watch the parade. Our dog was especially happy because she got some treats. One was especially nice because it was a homemade treat from the FFA. So you definitely have a nice small town feel.

The bathroom was unique and small. It’s different than anything I’ve ever seen before but appeared efficient. The smart keypad door was too smart for me. User error on my part and Bryce gave me instructions on how to get in/lock and try again. I did have some difficulty with the screen door but that may have been from the wind storm my first night there. The exterior of the home was definitely upgraded to a more modern aesthetic. If I was able to stay longer I would have definitely used the fire pit. All in all, if I get to see my friends in Urbana again I’d choose the hillclimber house again."

The only complaint or issue we had was the bathroom situation and that there were no blinds in the main room where my son slept so the sun would wake him up. The bathroom issue was due to the size and that there wasn't an area to change and every time we took a shower it would get the toilet wet.

The house was clean upon our arrival and the electronic door lock with the code makes check-in a smooth and easy process. The space was exactly what we needed, including that it's pet friendly with an affordable pet cleaning fee."

Stayed with kids","This was really a perfect place to stay for the Jeff Jordan wrestling camp. We went back and forth all weekend for our son and it is literally a 10 minute ride to the high school. Everything on the ad is accurate. Bryce, The host, is extremely accommodating and very timely with communication. The street was quiet. A five minute walk takes you to the round a bout in town and there are several restaurants ( Cafe Paradiso was an excellent Italian cafe with extremely good Mushroom Ravioli with Red Pepper Sauce) a candy store, bakery, antique stores. Be aware if you stay in one of the Inns, on the round a bout, it may be a little noisy since all of the mufflers rumble as they come out of the round a bout."

I was already looking forward to my stay because of her friendliness and care. I arrived late after a long drive and it was very comforting to find a clean and cute space waiting for me and my dog. I loved the decor and details and you can tell a lot of thought had gone into it. I had everything that I needed for a short stay but I would love to come back someday and spend more time there. The neighborhood seemed very peaceful and quiet.

It is a lovely walk downtown with many restaurants and shops to enjoy. The neighborhood is beautiful and very safe. Lee Ann even sent a message that they were keeping an eye on the radar about the weather and would keep us informed. How sweet and caring is that?! We were lucky enough to have meet her and had a quick chat. Would have actually loved to set on the porch and talk with her more. I can’t forget to mention the easy self check in.

Stayed over a week","This was my first Airbnb trip, and it far exceeded my expectations! I stayed for 11 days just to get away. It's on the second floor above the hosts' residence but felt like I was in a home of my own. It was snowy and very cold outside (Jan-Feb), but inside was perfectly cozy! Each room has radiant heating along with a tower heater (the ones in the bedroom and living room room are oscillating with remotes), and there's also an electric fireplace in the living room. My little ESA LOVED curling up in front of them. There was a very brief power outage, but it was an easy fix; Lee Ann texted me back immediately to have me reset the breaker, and everything went back to normal. These things happen, especially in older homes; I only mention it to show how quickly she responded and resolved the problem!
I was also there during a major winter storm, Lee Ann offered to pick up provisions for me at Kroger before it hit so I wouldn't have to go out myself! When it was time to leave, Eric even scraped the ice off of my car.
It's conveniently close to a somewhat busy area, although I thought it would be farther out from the general sounds of traffic at night. This has nothing to do with the hosts or accommodations themselves and it's not excessive so most people won't notice, but I can be sensitive to noise, especially when trying to sleep. There was a loud sports car nearby that woke me up each day, but I was able to easily fall back asleep when it left. I've never slept on a memory foam mattress before, and the first night I thought it was way too firm.. but a few minutes later it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Every night after that I looked forward to it and it immediately felt perfect. I was sad going back to my own bed!
I really could rave on and on about all of the positives. Lee Ann and Eric truly went above and beyond. Wonderful hosts and beautiful home, I recommend staying here 100%!"

Her place is even better than the photos. The amount of space and privacy exceeded my expectations by far. It is super clean, fresh and beautifully appointed. Lee Ann has thought of everything a guest could possibly need. The bed is super comfy with soft sheets and linens. I slept soundly. The kitchen and dining room area is very large. High speed Internet works great. I had to work while I was there, and no issues with my Teams video meetings. Love the bathroom. It is very large and again super clean. Lee Ann even provides extra toiletries in the event travelers have forgotten anything. The lavender bath salts are so relaxing.
The location is centrally located, and the neighborhood has so much charm. I wish I could have stayed longer. I recommend stopping at Depot Coffee while there. Super friendly and great coffee.

You take the beautiful old staircase up to a private, 4 room apartment. It was clean and well supplied with all the things you’d have available in your own home. It was quiet and the bed comfortable. You can tell Lee Ann loves to host. You get the royal treatment here. She was quick with communication and recommendations. We would love to stay here again."

Lee Ann is amazing and enjoys hosting, she has a lively spirit and enjoys meeting new people. She truly cared about our stay. She is detail oriented and it shows in the care she takes in providing for her guest. She is a genuine host who has a good heart. She went above and beyond to ensure we had a relaxing and enjoyable stay. When visiting Urbana we will always try our best to stay here. Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This is truly an amazing stay. We have stayed in so so many AirBnbs - across the world, and we have never felt as welcome as we did here. The 1868 home is so beautiful, and truly is like stepping back in time - but with all needed modern amenities. So many perfect touches; amazing snacks and beverages, fantastic teas and coffee. Everything you could possibly need was available.
The front porch is a welcoming haven. A perfect place for morning coffee or evening wine. And Crix (the lab) is the best welcoming committee. He’s there if you need a pup visit :)
The home is walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants and the quaint downtown area. Honestly, just strolling down Court street and neighborhood was such a treat!
We will definitely return! I can’t imagine NOT staying there when we are next in town. Don’t miss this opportunity! Stay at “1868 Itanianate Casa” for a beautiful, relaxing vacation - even if just overnight!"

It is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and the space is very well laid out and furnished. We enjoyed our stay and wished it was more than one night!

Stayed one night","I needed a quick place to stay with a dog on the way from Chicago to NC with a very late arrival! Lee Ann answered all my questions quickly, offered to personally pick up anything I needed since I would be arriving late, met me at the door at 4 am when I got there, told me to stay as late into the afternoon as I needed to rest up, completely stocked up on snacks for when I got there, left a care package for me at the door in the morning with breakfast and water for my trip, and supplied everything you could need staying the night somewhere! Not just your little soaps and conditioners, there were cotton balls, swabs, razors, tooth brush and paste, handmade soap, sponges you can take with you! I’m a young solo traveler and it gets a little rough sometimes being the only one taking care of yourself. Felt like I was staying with my mom, except Lee Ann was nicer! (Lol)
The only thing that could have made it better is if she asked me to move in. Absolutely beautiful space in a beautiful historical home, hosted by a beautiful family. Thank you so much Lee Ann!"

Lee Ann’s place meets and exceeds all that and more. The location is great, right near town and easy access to main roads, good parking and quiet location. The home itself is beautiful very well appointed you can tell a lot of thought and care went into restoring this 1868 home. The amenities were wonderful having coffee and breakfast available without having to go out the first morning was so nice. I slept well and had plenty of time to relax and just enjoy the small town feel of Urbana. You will not be disappointed in this home or the hosts. I hope to be back to Urbana this spring and as soon as plans are set will be booking this home again."

Group trip","We had a wonderful time at Sara's place. The historic home was truly amazing. Beautifully decorated with lots of spaces to explore and enjoy. There are also great places to eat locally, and we enjoyed that.
Here are some tips I would give to prospective renters. Remember it's a very old, historic house so plumbing and electric reflect that. Electrical outlets in the bedrooms are few so bring an extension cord. Multiple people showering at the same time leads to low water pressure so time your showers. The home has lots of step ups and downs between rooms and lovely antique furniture and decorations so it might not be best for really young children (toddlers). Also, there are quite a few places where electrical outlets don't have a cover plate. That would be an easy fix for the owners but until that is taken care of it's a safety hazard for kids. But, having added those caveats, we thought it was an amazing place to gather a large group and we loved it there!"

Great working boiler- had exceptional heat all light long with temps 16°F. Very large and spacious accommodation. Would recommend highly to larger groups especially. We were able to utilize all three showers simultaneously without drops in water pressure or temps-Two thumbs up."

We saw so much wildlife- deer, woodchucks, Cooper hawks. It is a wildlife sanctuary in the middle of Urbana. It was hot and humid during our stay, so trying to air condition the whole house from 5 window units in the upstairs bedrooms was a real challenge. Overall, it was a great value and we would definitely return."

Group trip","The house is lovely with lots to look at and discover. From our three toddlers to great grandma and great grandpa, all four generations enjoyed it. The host was so cooperative with our need for a late checkout. We took care of the kitchen trash, but they didn't ask us to do anything to clean up after ourselves--they took care of all the linens and bedding. It's a historic old home, built in the early 1800s, with lots of nooks and crannies, so if you have bad allergies to dust, you may have some difficulty. But otherwise everything was clean and functional. Had hot water for showers and all the fluffy white linens we needed. There's nowhere else we could have stayed with 10 adults so affordably and comfortably. We would definitely stay again if we were back in the area."

Stayed with kids","Nice quiet location. I grew up in Urbana, and surprisingly never knew this was a historic house. Relatively close to the bike trail that travels the town from end to end. Our plans for visiting family unfortunately had to change, so we spent more time at the house than expected and I must admit, the wicker furniture in the main TV room is not the most comfortable. Also, the pots/pans selection in the kitchen is very limited. Had we needed to cook for ourselves more than the couple of meals we prepared, it would have been very difficult to do so.
Overall though, we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at the Mechansburg Manor! A quiet neighborhood within walking distance to several restaurants and playgrounds made it a prime location for our family with young kids. The house itself was absolutely adorable, clean, and extremely well furnished. It has a very cozy atmosphere, and we could tell Joshua and Stacey had spent considerable time and effort to make it feel like a home away from home! The kitchen was well stocked with appliances, cookware, and utensils. They supplied us with everything we could have needed, plus some. We also appreciated how they stayed in touch during our stay - making sure we were comfortable, safe after a storm went through the area, and offered us a late checkout. 10/10 experience at the Mechansburg Manor."

Especially since I also had family coming from up north, thinking we were going to have to stay at a hotel. I was happy/relieved when I found this charming home that was only a couple minutes from my family’s house.
When I walked in, I fell in love. It was very clean, it had everything you would need. We all decide we plan on renting here every time we get together if it’s available.
Thank you again Josh & Stacy for this beautiful Airbnb!

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough good about the hosts. They went above and beyond making this home PERFECT for my parents (74 and 82) to stay in through Christmas. They decorated it with a Christmas tree and decorations just for there stay and even left a couple of gifts for the family to take with them. As for things you’ll need, well you won’t need for anything. The home was built in 1880 and has rich history. With that comes some uneven (but very safe) terrain. My parents loved it and we did as well; even deciding to do Christmas Eve dinner there instead of my house. It was cozy and inviting. I’m sure we will book again in the future."

Stayed a few nights",The house was very clean and comfortable. Check in was super easy with clear instructions. We love the character of the older homes with the rolling floors but there was no creaking or noise when walking across the 2nd floor so very sturdy! Joshua was very attentive and was sure to leave another contact info when he was going to be out of range for a day just in case we needed anything. With the water filter system being down for repair they provided complimentary bottled water. The first night we drove less than 20 minutes to eat dinner at Der Dutchman in Plain City. The second night we stayed close by and ate at the local Mixn's N Fixn's country dinner with morning coffee from Simple Coffee Company. Both are a short 2 minute drive or a nice 8 minute walk and were absolutely wonderful. After checkout on Saturday we drove 15 minutes to Urbana to visit all the shops before we headed home. We will definitely stay again when coming to the area. We are already planning another trip.

This is probably the best Airbnb we have stayed at as far as little extras and a very well stocked kitchen . Our kids appreciated the little snacks and juice upon arrival, as well as games and crayons. We had plenty of space for our family of 5 children ages 2,4 & 6 all slept comfortably. There is plenty of room in any bedroom for a Pack N play if needed . We had everything in the kitchen we needed to prepare coffee and dinner for our family . We stopped in Urbana on the way for a few groceries which I definitely would recommend because there aren’t many stores in the area . We did see a couple local diners up the road but didn’t stop in .

Everything you could possibly need as far as toiletries is there if you need it- down to toothbrushes, shaving cream, and nail polish remover.
The house is historic, and with that comes some quirks. The floors aren’t level and it’s a very odd feeling at first. We got used to it after a day or so. The stairs are not an even height, so you must take your time going up and down. And watch your head! All of these things were disclosed, and are not a deterrent. It’s part of the charm of the house.
There were plenty of pillows and throw blankets to cuddle up with while watching tv or reading. The town itself has a couple restaurants that we tried and liked- Mixx 165 and Mixin’ & Fixin’ diner.
We had a wonderful long weekend and can’t wait to come back!"

Helpful beyond describing. Very proactive with giving us ideas and suggestions for everything like how to work the TV to restaurants and sites to see. The amenities were out of this world and more than I could’ve even provided for myself. My 18 and 19 year olds even loved the place. Beautiful historic home. There are not many places I would visit more than once because I like to see new sites, but I will definitely be back to Joshua’s place.
Also, they were very willing to work with us on booking a second night. We fell in love with the place, and then discovered a storm was coming in the area we were supposed to travel the next day so we booked an extra night. They were outstanding at helping us out .
I cannot say enough positive things about this place.

The house was incredibly well stocked, too, with everything you could need….from snacks to cooking implements to toiletries to board games.

From the cozy living space to the welcome snack basket (more than just ""snacks"") the perfectly stocked kitchen and the very comfortable beds... This home had everything we needed,and was MUCH more than we expected! The town was like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting, and if you don't grab at least 1meal from Mixins and Fixins (recommended by our amazing hosts, Joshua and Stacey) you're missing out. We will book this home for EVERY future trip to Ohio. Stacey was so amazing and worked with us directly through a glitch in the AirBnB system.

I am very happy. I chose his house for my daughters, sweet 16 overnight stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Giving thanks for this place to celebrate Thanksgiving. My husband and I decided to celebrate the holiday near our daughter, a student at OSU. It was just going to be so much easier than trying to bring her home to South Carolina. So we found this place, pet friendly, about 45 minutes from campus. It was beyond perfect. I have rented through AirBnB and VRBO across the US and Europe. Many places are exactly as described, I've never had a real problem. But this place? It went far and beyond even the description. I knew that I wanted a full kitchen, but this one was so well equipped and supplied, that it rivaled my own. There was coffee, teas, spices. Bathroom had abundant towels and extremely hot water. Beds were tremendously comfortable and had abundant pillows and blankets. Living room was deliciously inviting, we enjoyed many naps in the reclining couches. Backyard was perfect for my dogs. There is even a huge park just under 1/2 mile away with a dog park!
It was just perfect."

The location was beautiful and quiet with beautiful trails for my dog to explore! Rita was super helpful the entire stay! During bad weather (tornado warnings) she communicated with us to make sure we were safe and was on top of the radar in case anything bad would have occurred (thankfully nothing did). She even provided an extra heater on a particularly cold night and left in on the porch for us without us asking! Very kind and considerate, going 100% above and beyond what I expected. Will definitely go and visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","We really loved our stay here. When we arrived, Rita mentioned that there was an opening the following night. Without hesitation, we took the second night. We felt right at home in this cabin. It was comfortable and clean with just enough decorations to accent the interior. On our full day, we wandered the trails, played some music and had dinner at The Farm Market Restaurant, based on Rita's suggestion. We didn't use the fire pit at night, but actually spent some time relaxing during the day. Plenty of wood was available, as well kindling and starters had we chosen to have a fire each night. The feeder, located within view of the front porch, provided a show of several bird varieties. On our drive to dinner, we spotted a Bald Eagle by it's large nest, which was a bonus. I think we may try to return to this little cabin, although it's not near any of our future bucket list excursions. Having stayed in 8 airbnb's over the course of 3 weeks, this was the BEST!"

The cabin was very nice inside and out. Our dog also thoroughly enjoyed going for walks in the woods and sitting by the nearby fire. We were close enough to several small towns for when we wanted to go out for a night. In particular, we would highly recommend Fusion 40.38 and Teabaggers in Urbana.

I surprised my wife with the cabin after having to cancel our anniversary plans due to her needing surgery. and she was astonished, it is just our kind of cozy little place. This was our first air bnb experience and I couldn't have been happier. I originally thought this was a lone cabin tucked away in the woods which is what I am used to ... I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jared and Rita live right on site but everything is very thoughtfully set up in a way you still feel very private and secluded but someone is right there in case of emergency. The trails were great and kind of just wandered around the property. Everything was just a perfect addition to our visit all the way from Arizona. I only wish we could have brought our pups they would have loved it, Everything is set up to be very pet friendly. I can't say enough good things and what an amazing experience at such an affordable price. We will definitely be back.!"

Everything was spotless.
Very well equipped with everything we needed and more!!!
Very friendly and accommodating host.
You're never really sure what you're going to get, but this experience exceeded my expectations. The location was beautiful with acres of woods to explore. We spotted deer just about every time we took a walk.
Could only stay 2 nights, but would have loved to stay longer."

The cabin was clean, nicely decorated, and has everything you need. The trails right outside your door were great, and good restaurants and other 'things to do' such as Ohio Caverns where close by (within a 10-20 minute drive). We highly recommend this cabin!"

It was extremely windy, however, I'm a trained chef and know how to wrap a grill so hot ash has a much lower chance of escaping the grill. .. other than that, I was a tiny bit taken aback by how close the property owner was to my cabin. As I soon found though, she left me completely alone. which is what I came for. I've already re-booked for june."

We loved that we were able to bring the dogs with us. Enjoyed the trails, took advantage of the fire pit, and relaxed in the hammock. I’m from Austin where there’s lots of outside things to do, moved to Indiana where there’s not as much, so I just loved every moment of this space. My husband and I also got to go to the Ohio Caverns and had a great time! The caverns were super close by so that was neat. Overall we had a nice weekend and I would (and already have) recommend this to friends. Rita was also a sweetie and got us all settled :)"

It's the best of both worlds - you're in a private, secluded space surrounded by woods and peaceful farmland, yet you have all the comforts of modern living (including good water pressure and temperature in the shower, always my top priority). We loved the firepit, the nature trails, the starlit sky (no light pollution), and the comfortable bed and futon. The cozy log cabin was all-wood - floors, walls, furniture - which we also loved. And Rita made us feel completely at home and welcome, including our dog, who even got her own blankets and towels to use."

The hosts are very thoughtful and had everything we could have needed. We enjoyed the trails and hanging out by the fire (everything was provided). The kids loved the hammock. The area surrounding the cabin is so beautiful and they have a very nice welcome book that had a detailed list of places to eat and/or visit in the area. We ended up going to Ohio Caverns which is only about 10 minutes from the cabin and it was an amazing experience. I enjoyed relaxing on the front porch in the morning with my tea (which was provided), watching the birds and listening to nature. Before we left, a hummingbird came up to my daughter’s window for a few seconds as if it were saying goodbye. ☺️"

One thing to note - you are going to be right next to the host. The pictures don't do a great job of showing it, but the cabin is about 10 feet away from another one, so it's not as secluded as it looks"

The trails were so well maintained that it was easy to walk. we had rain throughout our time, but the canopy is so thick the rain had little effect on the trails.

Many nice small amenities (fire pit w/wood, charcoal grill, hiking trails, great wifi, interesting reads, etc) and felt cozy. The binder of points-of-interest helped us plan our evenings, which really enhanced our trip! Close to town where you can enjoy a great meal and the charm of Urbana's town square, but tucked away enough that you're truly in the woods. We didn't need anything, but felt like if we did, the hosts would quickly fill our needs. We will be back, no doubt!"

Stayed a few nights","Honest review. Good and bad things to say. We will be back here again to start. The cabin was great. Felt like it could be called home. It looked just like the photos. The bed, chair and futon were very comfortable. There was plenty to do inside the cabin when it was raining such as puzzles and games but the real place to be is outside. The wildlife which in our case was birds, red squirrels and chipmunks was very enjoyable. Our last night... we did hear a coyote close to the cabin. The trails were a great way to spend time. They were clear and easy to walk. Probably my favorite part the stars. The stars were awesome. Onto the bad. There is more than one cabin on the property and even one right next to our cabin. This made the feeling like the entire property being ours not true. I'm sure the owners wouldn't care much for noise or other things but felt limited. The gym was not part of the cabin The worst was one of the dogs who would bark at us and scare away the animals."

It was a bonding experience around the campfire, cooking on the grill, relaxing in the hammock, listening to and watching the birds and animals. Kids loved playing throw the stick with Tiller & Dax accompanied by the co-host Rita who is a GEM!
Played a lot of cards listening to the old fashioned radio.
Number 1 in our book and will return!
Anyone should come here as often as you can!"

Stayed with a pet",What a fantastic cabin! Lovely people to deal with who have very clearly put so much thought into making your stay very comfortable. We absolutely loved it there and wish we could have stayed longer. We just needed a place to lay our heads at night while in the area for state park visits/hiking but the cabin could have been our sole destination and we would have been quite happy with just staying there for the entirety of our trip. Maybe next time. Truly a gem.

Stayed about a week","The cabin was impeccable, as always - and we enjoyed so many things during our stay. It was great to get out on the trails and see the transition from brown forest bed to sprouts of green - and we saw new birds we hadn't seen in previous visits. We love how welcoming both the indoor and outdoor spaces are and one of our favorite things to do was simply sit on the porch, watch the birds and enjoy the sounds of nature. Jared and Rita are wonderful, accommodating hosts. We will continue to visit!"

The trails out back the cabin were beautiful, not too long of a walk around either. Provided firewood was awesome as we didn’t need to worry about that aspect, very very kind to include. It is also quite a close drive to the Ohio Caverns, which is great location-wise to take a day and go to, as well as visit some local markets and restaurants. I would 10/10 come back to this cabin, it was a great getaway for a couple days! :)"

My adult son with autism and I wanted a few days away from the city where we could experience some quiet and a slower pace. Despite some rain drizzle we were able to enjoy a stroll through the adjoining woods. The cabin is a great starting point for trips into Urbana, Yellow Springs and other nearby sights: John Bryan State Park, Glen Helen Nature Preserve, Clifton Gorge, Young's Jersey Dairy, just to name a few. Thanks so much for allowing us to stay at your cozy cabin!"

It was all written in a book also, but it was nice to not have to read instructions when we first arrived. We went hiking every day. So many places within A 30 min drive. My favorite was Kaiser lake just 10 min away. Urbana square has great restaurants and a fantastic cupcake place. It is only 15 minutes away. And of course the fire pit and hiking is right out your back door. We don’t have a dog and there was no issues with allergies or anything for us which is a bonus. But very dog friendly for people who have dogs. We will stay again. Thanks for a great trip!"

The TV had cable channels and even though Rita thought not, there was plenty of WiFi service to stream!
We loved that it was affordable, and was very dog friendly! (A very small fee for our dog).
Rita greeted us upon entry, to explain a few things and then let us relax. The directions to the cabin were spot on, and the GPS helped us get there just fine.
We definitely want to come back!!"

The cabin faces the woods, with an entrance to the hiking trails just steps from the porch. I appreciated that firewood was provided, and found the cabin to be very clean and well appointment.

The house was impeccable and the pictures do not do it justice. We will never forget the hospitality and generosity we were given.
The beds were comfortable the pillows too! I personally used the down stairs shower and upstairs shower and main floor tub all were amazing. The kitchen had everything needed to cook with. The views were amazing it was such a private get away.
The hosts of this property were outstanding and again I could never sum up our experience into words. They literally feel like family to us.

Stayed a few nights","What a great place to stay during our trip to Ohio! Even though we had business to attend to Columbus, we didn't want to stay in the city so we found this little gem instead & were not disappointed. The space had everything we needed for a comfortable stay & was within walking distance to restaurants & bars. It is above an Italian restaurant & yes, I recommend that you try them out. The food was delicious! Abuelas Kitchen was great too. I would definitely stay here again!"

I didn’t know that and had to grab a couple for my stay there. But we made due so overall a must and a for sure coming back stay. Thank you for the stay 😊

The building sits directly on the Main Street through town, which also happens to be a state highway, so there’s constant vehicle traffic (including semi-trucks) at basically all hours. Combined with the old windows, this makes for a serious noise problem, especially at night and early in the morning. If you’re at all sensitive to noise while trying to sleep, I’d avoid this property until the hosts get some more sound-insulating windows installed."

Overall, a nice location, very comfortable apartment that also felt very safe. Kim was very attentive and responded to messages quickly. She even accommodated my husband when my son and I had a flight delay. We had a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Kim is a great host. Everything is just as described, and so clean. The building is older, so has a bit of that kind of charm. Kim left water in the fridge, and all the dishes, etc. that made it easy for us to bring our own food. There is a market and deli in the same block, and the place is downtown, so easy to walk to shopping, etc., and centrally located, so it is easy to get to anything. If you want to stay in, she has all the cable, and the internet is great. Beds are comfy, and the shower has good water pressure. It is quite homey - comfy furniture, etc. I love the upstairs location. The master is located off the bathroom, and the other bedroom off the kitchen area. We loved our stay, and will be back!! Thank you Kim!!"

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay at Kim’s place! I’m a city/suburbs girl, so the ride up to the apartment was a little iffy for me. The small town country vibes are not what I am used to, so I was skeptical! However, the moment we walked into the apartment, I was pleasantly shocked! It was very nicely styled and well-kept and made my small worry dissipate. Kim has a local business, so the next day, as we were settling in, we ended up running into her as she came to check-up on us. I especially loved this because out of all the trips I’ve had, I’ve never had the owner personally come and make sure we were squared away. I would highly recommend this little apartment in Urbana. Great stay over all!"

The location was perfect as it’s downtown Urbana. There’s a nail salon, barbershop, hair salon and a market all within the same block as well as a nice restaurant in walking distance. Everyone was so friendly and Kim was quick to respond to any questions I had; her husband even helped me unload my car. I will definitely stay here next time I’m in town visiting family. #perfect"

Walking distance to a great bar (Bracken) and convenient to anything else you’d need (CVS, fast food, pizza, etc). We especially liked the two bottles of water in the fridge (assuming they were for us!) after having a few too many beers at the wedding ;)
We definitely recommend staying at Kim’s place for a weekend getaway!"
