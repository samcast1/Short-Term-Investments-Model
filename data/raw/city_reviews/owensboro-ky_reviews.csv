Stayed over a week","Great location for everything we went to Owensboro to do. Our little dog loved the fenced backyard. Cleanest, most comfortable place imaginable. All conveniences and more. The bed mattress was so comfortable and the linens amazing. The bath towels like a 5-star hotel. The HVAC system made it very comfortable inside and quickly shifted from cooling to heat and back as the outside temperatures shifted while we were there. It is a small house but plenty of space. All the kitchen appliances looked brand new.
Randall and Maria were very accommodating. We could not have asked for more gracious hosts. I would call them Super-Hosts. Will definitely plan to stay here again if it is available for our next visit."

Stayed with a pet",Maria & Randall went above and beyond the call of great hospitality. They surprised us with extra snacks and goodies. The house was immaculate. The beds were perfectly comfortable. I slept on one of the twin beds and do believe it was the most comfortable of any Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Owensboro is a lovely town of friendly people. I enjoyed my walks through the local area.

Stayed with kids","Thank you, Randall and We had a great stay for the holidays. The place was very clean, organized, and comfy. There was a smell of sewage when we first entered the home and off and on in the bathroom that put a little damper on the ambience. No other comments mentioned the smell that I’m aware of so this could be a temporary issue. I would just ask the friendly hosts prior to booking. This place is worth your money and very convenient."

Stayed a few nights","Randall & Maria's Place is top notch. It is by far one of the best experiences that I have had. The home is beautiful, and is provided with everything you need for a short/long stay. I had the pleasure of being there for seven days and was sad to leave on the last day. I enjoyed all the amenities the home has to offer. The private personal parking is a bonus along with a very quiet neighborhood. The home is well equipped with safety measures. This beautiful home is conveniently located in the downtown area of Owensboro. This lovely home is right next door to Cruse Salon, Boutique, and Gifts. So be sure to stop in for salon or gift purchases. I promise you won't be disappointed. I almost forgot about the Coffee Bar and the refreshments provided upon arrival. After a 10 hr. drive the cold bottled water was a treat!
Thanks so much for being wonderful host. I look forward to my return!!"

and options of flavors.
Cute backyard fire pit wish we could have stayed longer to use it
Next time we come we would definitely consider staying at their place again
Liked that it was well stocked up in the bathroom too
would be nice to have scissors in kitchen drawer for cutting tags off gifts 😊
Dryer was loud (metallic noise) when drying otherwise it worked great and did the job 😊
The cool white lightbulbs were a little to bright maybe warm white bulbs would make it feel warmer."

Stayed one night","The place location was walkable to downtown for those willing to walk 1+miles, we were. It was extremely clean, had all of the amenities that we required, decorated so cutely and welcoming, very comfy beds. It was over Independence weekend and even had a few, just the right amount, of July 4th decor. I was a bit concerned about Dairy Queen being behind us with the noise and odor, neither was an issue at all. We ended up going to two of the recommended restaurants, Famous Bistro for dinner and The Miller House for breakfast, and they were both wonderful. We would stay there again in a heart beat."

Their communication was excellent and extremely timely from the moment I sent them an inquiry to book their place to the moment we checked out. Their kindness and hospitality went above and beyond our expectations. Their home is clean, cozy, and includes every amenity listed. They also provided a very nice assortment of snacks and drinks. They even went out of their way to add patriotic decorations around the home, as my Mom is Navy retired. If we ever are in the area again, we will be booking our stay with Maria and Randall! They are super hosts indeed! :-)"

When I requested to stay an extra night, the owners were responsive and accommodated my request within minutes. The only drawback to this property is that it can be a bit noisy due to its location, and the walls seem thin. But the noisiness dies down around 11pm and for us that was ok. We were staying up late anyways. We would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect place to stay during my long-weekend visit to Owensboro! The house was comfy and cozy - perfect for a single person. The location was very close to all the sights and restaurants but still private and quiet. Check-in and entry was very simple - really appreciated the keyless entry with the keypad so I didn't have to worry about keeping up with keys or accidentally locking myself out. The house included everything needed for a comfortable stay. I especially appreciated the abundant towels and the provided snacks - which included bottled water, fresh fruit, and coffee pods. It is quite small, especially the bathroom, so I wouldn't recommend it for groups or families with teenagers, but it's perfect for 1-2 people."

It was rainy so we didn’t get to use the backyard, but would have loved a chance to spend sometime around the fire pit. This was our first nights stay in Owensboro. We enjoyed live music by Chris Abell at Brasher’s Little Nashville and delicious beer and food at the Brew Bridge. Highly recommend Randall and Maria’s Owensboro house. Hoping to rent it again the next time we visit."

There were snacks which was nice since I was nauseous from treatment and was able to have small snacks. Thank you!!!
The place was very clean and decorated so cute reminded me of home. They were so quick to respond with any questions since the minute I booked.
Would definitely recommend and will stay again when in the area.

Stayed a few nights","Randall and Maria were terrific hosts! They were very responsive and helpful. Check in was easy and we felt very secure in the house. Their home was so clean and sanitary. I am a barefoot person and the floors were a dream to walk on. The house was perfect for our needs and had everything we needed. Plenty of fluffy towels, fully stocked kitchen (water bottles in the refrigerator and snacks on the counter, too) and even had shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotions in the bathroom. Good thing, too, because I forgot my body lotion! They even offered to drop off donuts in the morning! I ended up oversleeping (nice cozy beds!!!) and they were able to give us a little bit later check out so we could get all our belongings organized before we left. We appreciated the off street parking in the driveway and the quiet neighborhood to relax between our weekend commitments. We ate at Mi Ranchito Mexican Restaurant and had ice cream at Lic’s Deli & Ice Cream, both are highly recommended. Kentucky hospitality is second to none. We will be staying here again next time we visit Owensboro!"

This particular property is in a quiet neighborhood and on a fairly quiet street with schools nearby. My husband works remotely and loved being able to work upstairs separate from the living areas. Wi-Fi worked perfectly, even for Zoom. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and pots and pans of all kinds and the appliances are new. The shower has good pressure and there is also a tub to bathe the little ones. The beds and linens were very comfortable, and we appreciated the blackout curtains in the bedrooms.
Such a great experience: we will be back!"

You won’t regret it. Don’t hesitate a second. You can thank me later. If quiet and peaceful is your thing while waking up to mother nature every morning. Then you just found it!!!

They love the cosy, private house and appreciate the amenities such as k-cup coffee maker and provided snacks. Lynn is always around to greet them initially and makes sure they get checked in safety. My mom adores Lynn and her sweet hospitality. They find the house comfortable and just the right size. The bed and couch are perfect for sleeping and relaxing. The TV is set up nicely and easy to use. They have everything they could need at such a perfect price. They also enjoy the wooded view and the peace and quiet, yet are still only a few minutes from all the sites of Owensboro. It's truly a perfect location for their needs. We are very appreciative of Lynn and her lovely Airbnb house. It meets our needs perfectly!"

Stayed a few nights","Ten-star stay if AirBnB gave ten stars. Easily one of my most favorite AirBnB stays. From booking to check-out, Lynn was incredibly responsive, and even met us to say ""hello"" upon arrival. I don't know how to adequately state how perfect her place is. Quiet and serene, peaceful beyond belief, and other than the occasional lawn mower the only sounds were birds. Heck, it was almost TOO quiet to sleep - just kidding :). Spotlessly clean, well-stocked, and the washer/dryer is a huge bonus!
I was in town for an event, and absolutely fell in love with Owensboro's waterfront. I would consider coming back even if I have NO event to attend, but only if I could say here again! Thanks for everything Lynn!"

The house was just as described and very comfortable and clean. The area is lovely and would have been a great place to relax if not for the inclement weather.

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely cottage in a beautiful setting. The kitchen has all the necessary items for simple cooking, the place is very clean and decorated nicely, the bed is comfy (my son slept in the bed and I brought along a couple of sheets for the couch, and that was comfy, too). We loved being able to access trails right from the front yard, and there are some other parks a short drive away for hiking as well. Location is far enough from town that you feel you are in the country, but it's easy to get into Owensboro to take in the sights there too. Lynn left us some salty snacks which were much appreciated after our hot hikes in the woods, and we enjoyed chilling in the evening watching Netflix before bed. This was the first Airbnb experience for my special needs son and me, and it was a great experience! Highly recommended!"

The location is fantastic! In nature and outside the city, but still very close to everything. We sadly didn’t get to walk the nature trails too much, but hopefully next time we won’t have to work during the day so we can have more outdoor time.

This would be the perfect place for a romantic getaway or if you wanted to go solo, the perfect place to go and disconnect from the rush of everyday life. The bed was amazing, it felt like you were sleeping on a giant marshmallow, and you feel safe and welcome the whole time you’re there!
Thank you so much Lynn for sharing this little slice of nature with us!"

Lynn was great and very fast with communication. The cottage was super clean and had everything we needed for the week. Lynn's restaurant recommendations were spot on. We ate at the Mellow Mushroom, Legends, Moonlite BBQ and O'Bryan's and had great food each time. The cottage is in a perfect area, quiet and relaxing, but really close to a bunch of great shopping centers and anything you could need.

Tho the cottage is located next to a park on a quiet and beautiful property, it is very convenient to Owensboro Riverfront parks, the Western KY Botanical Garden,and only a short and easy drive to many attractions. Lynn is a truly special host who tries to ensure her guests have an excellent experience. Your privacy will be respected, and your comfort and satisfaction will be part of a very pleasant stay in this lovely and welcoming place.

We were in town for a baseball game at Kentucky Wesleyan and Marla's place was close to that and to really any area. You could jump right back on the highway and get to the south hotspot or the east end of town with all the restaurants with no problem. We didn't have time to go to the riverwalk, but it was close to that, too. The house was great. Wonderful kitchen and big tv in the living room. Great fenced-in back yard that we would have loved to enjoy on a warmer evening. Comfortable bedrooms. Front door glass was so clean we almost bumped into!! Great place to stay if you are in Owensboro!! Thanks, Marla!!"

I was so happy to find such a nice home on such short notice. When I arrived, check in was a breeze with key code entry. The house was EXTREMELY well accommodated with anything a person could need. Comfortable beds, very clean, beautifully decorated, off street parking, and the kitchen felt like mine at home- totally stocked with everything. Marla has a great house with a vaulted ceiling in the living area that is open to the dining and kitchen. The backyard space is lovely for entertaining as well. Marla supplied us waters in the fridge, keurig coffees of assorted flavors and several snacks. She communicated throughout the weekend and made it evident our satisfaction with her place meant a lot to her. She is a gracious host who really takes pride in her place and her reputation on this platform. I’m definitely staying here next time I’m in OBKY 🤗"

The house was adorably decorated for the season inside and out, and easy to find. Check in with the keypad was simple. The house and yard were well-kept. The inside of the house was spotlessly clean and contained all the extra items one might need for laundry, bathroom, and kitchen. There was even complimentary coffee, soda and a basket of snacks! The beds were comfortable and the bedding soft and clean. We enjoyed the ambience of the electric fireplace while winding down and watching TV at night. Our family of 4 was very happy to stay there for 4 nights while visiting family in Owensboro over Thanksgiving, and we'd stay there again!

We had a small incident, our toddler mistakenly locked the bathroom door on his way out, locking everyone out; Mr Mike and Ms Marla were ready and able to graciously assist with unlocking it within 30 minutes. Throughout our stay, Ms Marla and Mr Mike made it known that they were happy to help with whatever they could. There was a great fenced in backyard for our children to run around in. Lastly, this Airbnb is very conveniently located, in a very quiet neighborhood but within 10 minutes of downtown Owensboro and the Lazy Days Park, which was awesome for our children. Given the opportunity, we would definitely choose to come back for another stay."

Thank you again! and we will definitely be back to visit our family more often and will most definitely be coming back as soon as possible!!! ☺️"

Stayed a few nights","This was a great stay. First off I don’t think it is possible to have better communication from a host, I have been in a few houses with really good communication but this was above and beyond from Marla.
Cleanliness of the house was outstanding.
The Beds for myself and my Son were great, no problems and bedding’s were clean, bedrooms are good sized and the TV in the one room is a nice addition.
Kitchen is well stocked if you are cooking, I and the refrigerator was very clean and it had some drinks already in it waiting for us when we arrived. Nice touch.
Marla also left plenty of snacks another nice touch.
Washer and dryer works good and more then enough laundry supplies for us.
Back yard is nice and nice little seating area, we didn’t have time to use it this time but will next time.
Overall this was a great experience for my Son and I.
Will be back next time it has openings.
Thank you Marla"

Grill has a pile of charcoal already in it. Kitchen is well equipped with utensils. Also 'may' find some needed things like salt, pepper, oil, coffee, cream, butter, noodles. Nice snack basket (we didn't use the box of cheesecake muffin mix). Main area of living room, dining area, kitchen was small but comfortable, no complaints at all. Bedrooms likewise. Oh, and Marla communicates quickly. I would stay there again to visit my hometown."

We were simply grateful he made it to live to see his graduation. Marla communication was awesome. She checked in frequently. Everything you could ever need was there. She provided a grill in her amazing back yard. This house is a no brainer and where we will still when we come down if available. It felt like home and we felt the LOVE within Marla and her home. Best Airbnb stay ever! Not because of the size of the house or anything just because the feel , attention to detail and communication! Thanks Marla keep being a light on Airbnb and I’m sure in your personal life also!"

Stayed with kids","Great place for a family stay, but, somehow also a great place for a business professional in need of serenity. This place is great! I had everything I needed, and a few things I didn’t think I’d need- did! The decor is setup so “homey”. It’s not over done, like many places do to appear “fancy”. Comfort was certainly a priority for this host! Each room has a different character feel to it, but all are classily done. There’s plenty of storage space for bags, luggage, and clothes. The kitchen has all it needs and then some. There’s a dedicated space for an office area if needed as well. This came in handy! I was staying with my family but during the day I worked from home. The office area was much appreciated! Everything is clean and sleek. I have this “I could totally live here” vibe! Lol! They’ve made so much of the space available. The backyard is lovely as well. With patio furniture and yard space to enjoy. We used the oven to make pizzas, and the washer and dryer as well. It was very nice having that available on site! I have zero complaints or suggestions! I’ve given 5 star reviews to places that weren’t near as accommodating, so, I’m a little upset I can’t give more than that! LOL! If you need a place in Owensboro, for whatever reason, this is the one! Thanks, Marla!"

The extra touch of goodies was so sweet of her as we traveled 14 hours from home for a funeral. She definitely made us feel as if we were at home.
The home was spotless, all instructions to check in and out were perfect and we could not have picked a better home and host to stay with while in Kentucky.
We will definitely be booking again with her when we come back to visit family!

I felt like I pretty much had the entire place to myself (even though my unit was one of several in the house), as my unit had a fully furnished living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. I didn't need Logan for much since I was only in Owensboro for two nights, but whenever I did message him, he'd always reply within a couple minutes.
The house is located in a quiet neighborhood and is maybe a 10-minute walk away from downtown Owensboro and the Ohio River. I didn't get to explore much, but the entire surrounding area is super-walkable and there are a lot of restaurant options once you get to the downtown area. Will definitely stay here again if I find myself in Owensboro in the future."

Stayed with kids","You’ll be in awe seeing this house. It’s huge and beautiful. Such a unique place to stay for a bit. Tons of space and loaded with antique ambience. Katelyn was an excellent host and genuinely seemed like she wanted to make sure our stay was great.
Do keep in mind that IT IS AN OLD HOUSE. If that sounds cool, you will love it. But know that everything creaks and you will see signs of age everywhere - a positive for me, but have realistic expectations. From a light and picky sleeper, the beds were very comfy but lots of light at all hours from the nearby streetlights and plenty of noise if anyone is awake and moving around. There is no shortage of things to admire in literally every room. We spent hours just exploring, and the hardest part was choosing which table to eat at every meal. We felt fancy during our whole stay.
Owensboro isn’t big but is a cute town. Lots of good restaurants and parks. The free art museum far exceeded our expectations, and it’s right down the road!"

We drove to Mammoth Cave and spent the day hiking, were lucky enough to have some time to grab a late lunch at The Brew Bridge in Owensboro, and then scooted down to Beaver Dam Amphitheater to catch a concert. For a family - this AirBNB was perfect. It’s aesthetically beautiful, in a welcoming, unpretentious way. The full kitchen made breakfast prep a breeze (it had EVERYTHING we needed), we were able to do a load of laundry to reduce the hectic return back home, and the fenced in backyard was a safe, beautiful spot for our kids to run around.
We will definitely return to this great space, highly recommend Brandon as a host, and have pointed some friends back in MO this direction for a great trip! Highly recommend!!!"

This is a great home and I recommend it. One suggestion would be to provide some firewood for those that want to use the fire pit. There’s plenty of outside furniture however, it’s in need of being replaced.

Seamless booking and check-in experience, super responsive host, and the house is just adorable. Comfy beds, beautiful decor, little touches like remote control lamps and USB outlets that made settling in very easy. Kuerig coffee maker with pods stocked. Loved waking up to amazing coffee each day. Super cute backyard area with multiple seating areas and fire pits. Driveway parking. I could keep going… such a wonderful spot to call home for a week. Brandon is an excellent host. I’d give 10 stars if I could. Perfect stay. Thank you Brandon!"

Stayed with kids","AMAZING, SPECTACULAR, PEACEFUL, and so many other words I could use for my 1st Airbnb experience. I am originally from Grandview Indiana and moved away in 2016 to be with my fiancé. We usually stay in a hotel when we come in to visit; however, with a 6 year old and 1 year old hotels are just a little cramped. This was our first time doing an airbnb and Rick made the process so easy. As soon as it was booked he sent a message, day before he messaged again asking about arrival time, and day before our departure letting me know how to check out. Those things meant a lot to me because my anxiety gets the best of me so knowing the expectation made me feel at ease. The location was in a peaceful neighborhood. And the backyard was so nice! We make a trip at least once a year during the summer or twice a year depending on our schedule. The honey-badger will be my first CHOICE!
Thank you Rick for everything!"

Very clean, hardwood floors, nicely decorated, in a safe, quiet neighborhood, large privacy fenced backyard with covered patio seating area including a small TV. TV’s in living room and both bedrooms, washer and dryer in basement. He even had bottled water in the fridge and a few snacks and coffee, creamer, and sugar. This is the place I will be staying the next time I come to Owensboro.
I had hoped he would have self check-in. However, it was no trouble at all to check in and out. He lives right next door and was very flexible when we called to say we would arrive way later than expected. He met us just after 10:15pm and showed us where everything was. Rick was super friendly.
We pulled into alley behind the house and the privacy fence opened up with a garage door opener and we pulled into the back yard and closed the fence behind us. I highly recommend Rick’s AirBnb."

He answered all my questions ahead of time, checked in on us, and offered assistance if we needed it (even offered to drive us to the riverfront!). The furniture was actually comfortable, not that stiff stuff 😉 The parking is awesome (wooden gate with a door opener so you can park in the back yard and lock your car in). We will be back thats for sure!"

It was great to have an outdoor furnished patio to enjoy. The appliances inside are all updated and the living room is well equipped and very comfortable. I’m a tall person and appreciated a taller option with regards to the shower head as well. Also having bottled water already in the fridge and snacks to enjoy upon arrival were a special and welcome touch as well! Overall 5 stars!!

He gave our 2 year old a little toy car and pulled out a high chair for us without us even having to ask. There was a stocked kitchen with water, coffee, sugar, creamer, snacks and loads of different dishes. It was such a nice stay and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay again or recommend this home to anybody in the area."

What a great place to stay! My husband and I really enjoyed our time at the Honeybadger. Why stay in a hotel room, when instead you can enjoy a roomy retreat with two bedrooms and a bath, and welcoming living and dining room, plus a back porch and fully equipped kitchen, that is decorated with personality? It is still fairly close to the downtown area along the river. Five plus stars for the Honeybadger!

This quiet house has delightfully decorated rooms, fans and controllable AC, fully stocked kitchen supplies - not to mention bottled water in fridge and snacks, coffee on counter. Host even offered use of washer/dryer. And sitting out on covered patio for breakfast was lovely. Bed was very comfortable, and plenty of storage space. Very clean everywhere in the house. Wifi was strong, and Netflix on large screen in living room was appreciated - TVs also in each bedroom. But best of all is the host: of the dozens and dozens of hosts I’ve had in the last 5 years, Rick is the most gracious, kind, giving. Absolutely fantastic host. Hope we get to Owensboro again!"

The full kitchen and dining room have everything needed including an air fryer. Rick had stocked the fridge with water and ice for us and left us a very nice welcome note and gift of cookies and candy. There is a full size coffee maker, filters and coffee provided. There is a nice TV in the living room with Amazon TV and Netflix, 2 comfy couches and a recliner with throw blankets. The bathroom has a tub and shower, plenty of towels and wash cloths, toiletries and a hair dryer. The bed in the master bedroom was comfortable. That bedroom has a TV as well. We didn't use the 2nd bedroom because it was just me and my husband. The entire house has nice hard wood floors and everything was very clean. There is also a great outdoor space in the back yard with a couch, rockers, and TV that is completely fenced in. Parking is in the gated back yard so it's secure. We will definitely stay again when in the area."

Our 2 year old loved Smother’s Park (4 minutes from Rick’s) and we loved the riverfront and all the restaurants and coffee shops along it. Rick’s was a quiet respite to come back and nap at and quiet at night too, even though it’s only a few minutes from where everything is. Amazing! The house was wonderfully stocked and so comfortable. It has a great outdoor space. There was only the 3 of us but the house could comfortable fit double that with comfortable sleeping places. Rick was incredibly helpful and helped us “check in” and showed us around. The house was 30 minutes of an easy drive from Holiday World. We will be back and we have referred the house to our friends, especially those with young kids. Thank you Rick!"

No sponge, laundry or dish soap and only a couple rolls of toilet paper provided. we were there 5 days so these are necessities I feel should be included for the price point. Stairs were steeper than I thought they'd be and upstairs master doesn't have a bathroom.
Pros- very clean, great pillows, water pressure was amazing. Lots of space and so peacefully quiet! Close to grocery store, all the dishes you need to prepare food. Plenty of towels and coffee too.
Overall it was a great stay"

Stayed with kids",Really enjoyed our stay at William and Meredith's. The house was exactly as pictured. We did not have any problems or reason to message our host but they kept in contact to make sure we checked in ok and did not need anything. The house was very clean and felt like our home away from home for the weekend. Was in a good and safe neighborhood. Would highly recommend this house if you are looking for a place in the area.
