Stayed a few nights","Sonya's home was absolutely gorgeous. She was quick to respond to any questions I had. One thing I would recommend is putting some blinds or curtain over the bathroom window for privacy since there is a soaking tub in there and the neighbors aren't too far from it. Other than that, the stay was perfect. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","It was an okay stay but I probably wouldn't do it again. The good - super fair pricing, clean and Andrew is super responsive. The negative - it had a weird smell that required me to buy candles and spray + the strange neighbors outside across the street made me uncomfortable (catcalling.) The wifi /tv didn't work half of the time so I had to leave and find somewhere else to work on my laptop, which was part of the reason I booked."

Stayed one night","Roomy booking with so many thoughtful touches-bottled water in the frig, choice of several snacks, books, you wanted to read, & cards & some games! The bed was very comfortable. We didn’t use the kitchen to cook but easily could have since it looks like Andrew has most everything one would need. The frig was great since we brought a cooler with our own snacks& drinks. Everything was clean as a pin! Andrew was so patient & helpful when we booked for the wrong night by mistake. It’s easy to see why The Hideaway had great reviews, it deserves them!"

The only negative was the towels and blanket at end of the bed had a slight dog smell. We connected Andrew and he apologized and offered to bring us a new blanket. Overall it was a great stop from Atlanta to Fort Worth, good deal too!"

Stayed one night","My husband needed a place to stay for the night and we aren’t familiar with the area so I checked out airbnb instead of a hotel. This was our first experience ever using it. Now, I will always use it but Andrew has set the bar so I have high standards for them. My husband went to eat at a local restaurant called The Cotton Restaurant and he said the food and atmosphere was a delight. I highly recommend The Hideaway. Thank you Andrew."

Stayed with a pet","Better than expected. The Hideaway is truly that; a hideaway. The entry is tucked around the side of the building in a somewhat obscure side door of a multi tenant building. Although there were other people in the building, there was no noise whatsoever; very quiet. The Hideaway itself has everything you need for a short stay and is well appointed with amenities like a coffeemaker, cook surface, full size refrigerator, very nice washer and dryer and a small grassy side yard for our pet to use. The bathroom and shower is conveniently located adjacent to the bedroom and is well appointed. The shower is spacious and functions very well. The only caveat is that the surrounding neighborhood isn't 5 star, but the Hideaway is tucked in so well that this wasn't a concern. Off-street parking helped tremendously and overall we felt very safe and secure. I definitely would stay in this location again and I can recommend it to you without reservation."

I had a hard time trying to lock the door after I left. Clear living and check out instructions. The Wi-Fi was slow, but there may be a new one through Xfinity, which I didn’t know how to access. Nice washer and dryer washing machine refrigerator stove Bathroom, kitchen bedroom, towels, bed covers, etc. Everything you need!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved this place!!! It is conveniently located--about a 10 minute drive of anywhere we wanted to go. And it was great to step out the front door and stroll through a beautiful historic neighborhood. It has the charm of an older home while being totally up to date and stylish. It looked just like the photos. We appreciated special touches like water, snacks and coffee. Also, the bed was very comfortable. We would recommend this house and expect to come back."

Stayed with a pet","Andrew's place was just what we needed while moving a cat. I do recommend bringing something to set any angular things like a pet crate on, like we did, as the floors are wood. They're one of several features of the place with historic charm, although that's contrasted with office-style fluorescent lights in the living/kitchen space. The host left a guide binder, snacks, and water for us, and communicated well.
The location is close enough to a nearby bar that we could hear their live music when we parked, but we didn't hear it once we were inside, so I don't think it will disturb anyone's sleep.
The neighborhood features a lot of one-way streets, so be extra attentive to signage.
We would stay here again."

Our master bathroom was very spacious and shared by both bedrooms upstairs. The whirlpool jets were not operational during our stay. The kitchen was spacious and had just about everything we needed, although more coffee mugs would have been appreciated! Overall, it was a great place to stay in Monroe and we loved the outdoor shared space, which is a bonus! We would definitely stay there again!"

Our only issues were finding some dirty dishes in the cabinets and some people in our group not favoring the comfort of their beds. (My bed was comfortable to me!) location is quiet and safe. There were 2 dogs that roam the area and they came to see us several times while we hung out on the beautiful patio. They were friendly and sweet dogs so no worries if they come to see you during your stay! Overall; it was just what we needed.

The rooms were huge, the beds were very comfortable, the host always texted back immediately, and the location was close to everything! Don’t hesitate to book this incredible BnB, it’s definitely the best with the best, most communicative hosts I’ve ever had."

Stayed with kids",We had to travel from Las Vegas to Louisiana for a funeral and needed a place at last minute to accommodate a nice size group. We decided to get an Airbnb. We came across Audrey’s place and from start to finish the process was very simple. Audrey’s place was wonderful. It was very roomy and spacious and located in the perfect quiet neighborhood. It was extremely clean and equipped with lots of extras. We would most definitely be using Audrey’s place again and I recommend any and everyone that passes through Monroe and needs a nice clean spacious place To look up Aubrey.

Stayed one night","I have had to go to downtown Monroe for business fairly regularly for 13 years, sometimes for a day, sometimes for 1-2 weeks. Before discovering this AirBnB, my preference has been to try to get a room at one of the Pecanland Mall/Airport chain hotels. I found this AirBnB far more to my liking & a much better option (and add that hotel rooms in Monroe can sometimes be surprisingly hard to book). I found the unit to be exactly as depicted (which was great), a wonderful space with everything you would want. It is true that the hard wood floors do creek a little but that’s not a problem for me. Great combo of amenities and charm. Will certainly stay again (already booked for future business trip in a few months). Also, finding & getting settled in was incredibly easy. I did not arrive until 11:30 pm after 3 hour drive & it was great to be able to get in quick & easy & immediately wind down. Dedicated parking for Castle Hall also fantastic & convenient."

The floors are so very creaky, but that’s alluded to in the description, and the guy above us didn’t do anything obnoxious.
The rooms are so dark at night that you’ll have no idea what time it is haha. The surrounding area is quiet, save for the clock tower, but I thought that was cool, and couldn’t hear it from my room.
I felt safe being here, and there was an additional alarm to set if I didn’t.
I would definitely recommend staying here"

I was able to see each unit and as I walked from room to room, I thought, "" I like it better than the last one"" and I continued to say that for all 9 of the condos! They are all wonderful and like a home away from home. So much character in the entire building. Easy parking and walkable to coffee shop and downtown restaurants. The condos had all amenities you could ask for and really nice televisions with wifi that we used for music while our daughter's bridesmaids got ready in our unit. Jason was so very responsive and helpful. He was flexible with us and allowed us to arrive before our check-in time when we had family members who arrived early from the airport. Staying here was the best decision we made for the wedding weekend! We look forward to coming back to use it when we need to stay in Monroe overnight. This place was AWESOME!"

Jason communicated well and his place is set up so nice with lots of storage. We loved the collapsible carts downstairs that we could use on the elevator to help get things up to our condo, and then back down at check out. We also enjoyed the location and it was nice to walk to Mass at St. Matthews on Sunday. We will definitely book again on our next stay in Monroe!"

Stayed a few nights","This space is beautiful and well decorated and in a great location to walk to several nice restaurants downtown. Check in was easy and host was easy to work with. The only drawback is that the walls in the building are very thin, so you can hear everyone around you. The experience of your stay might depend on how quiet the other guests around you are. For the most part, it was pleasant, but one of the nights we stayed, one of the neighbors had a screaming match above is, making it difficult to sleep. If you stay in the building, I would recommend staying in one of their bookings on the 3rd floor."

Stayed one night","I’ve stayed at the condos before just not this specific one and it looks exactly like the photos.
It’s beautiful and spacious!
We’ve never had any issues until this time around.
Unfortunately, the floors were soooo dirty.. like, I was walking barefoot all night and when I went to go shower at the end of the night my fiancé and i noticed my feet were totally black.
The toilet in the master room had been used prior to our arrival like someone had forgotten to flush because there was toilet paper and pee inside.
I know everyone uses the restroom but I don’t like opening a toilet only to find out someone didn’t have a courtesy to flush...
:(
We used a pot and pan and had to hand wash it prior to using because it had a grease film on it..
I usually never have any problems with these condos and Jason is super responsive however after spending $250 for the night I was kinda disappointed on the overall cleanliness of the place.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s totally beautiful place, very romantic and brings backs lots of memories because it’s where my (now) fiancé and I met for the first time but there was just those little details that kinda ruined the night for us :/
Overall it’s a nice and safe place to stay but we weren’t too happy this time around.
Hopefully our next stay is better because we do love these condos!"

Dated knotty pine kitchen cabinets. Very cheap coffee maker. Could use some nicer seating on the front porch.
I’d say the house has plenty of room for two people and the architectural charm of an 1930’s home that has been nicely painted but needs some TLC in the bedrooms and kitchen to make them more inviting."

Stayed with a pet","Rarely do I stay at an Airbnb without having to be in constant communication with the host for one issue or another...that was not the case here!! Everything was exactly as described & was super accessible. If I had needed her, I'm sure she would have been just as responsive as she was during the booking phase, but again, everything was perfect, so I didn't have to bother her!
The house is an adorable older home in a great, very safe & convenient area. I HAD to book a pet friendly place & this one was everything I look for...big open yard that is fully enclosed, roomy interior for kennels, etc!(I will say, for the dog owners looking for a place, there are 2 pretty reactive dogs on the left side, but the neighbor was super nice and we worked together to manage when our puppies went out so they wouldn't fight through the fence!
Chandler even had a cute little Christmas tree set up, so I ended up doing a cute little Christmas photo shoot for me and my doggos! We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","As a person who travels to Monroe often, I cannot even tell you how excited I am to have found Chandler’s place!
Perfectly homey with every amenity that you could want or need! We travel with my Frenchie, Julep, and she had a large and secured backyard to play in - which was a huge bonus!
The beds were extremely comfortable, and being able to drink coffee on the front porch was so relaxing!
The house was decorated so cute - with even a Christmas tree so we still felt “in the spirit” being away from home!
Chandler is a one-of-a-kind host! We had a slight hiccup with booking (due to rescheduling) and she was able to accommodate us seamlessly. She also checked in on us after our arrival just to see if we needed anything, which was very thoughtful!
If you’re going to be in Monroe - this is the place to stay! The neighborhood is quiet, but you are only blocks away from restaurants, shopping, etc.
Truly a GEM in the 318!"

Remarkable attention to detail in the best way from the front door to the back door & from floors to ceilings! Curl up anywhere in this abode with a good book of your own (or there are great books here to choose from!), or gaze out the windows watching the beautiful birds fly around & trees swaying in the breeze! Take an afternoon stroll on the sweet, quiet streets of the neighborhood while smelling the fragrances of the roses and other various fragrant flowers or sit on the porch and speak to the friendly neighbors! It’s all here!!! I wish I could give this host and home more than 5 stars! Excellent, Chandler!!! I’ll be back!!! :)"

Amanda was also gracious enough to allow us to park our car and trailer on a car pad beside the house, so if you’re a bigger vehicle or hauli- you’re in luck’
The space itself is bigger and nicer than I actually read from the photos! The bathroom is a bit outdated but it’s perfectly useable and we had no problem doing what we needed to do. The main bedroom king bed was spacious and it was a very comfortable mattress. The living space was really nice and the kitchen had everything we needed.
We were just doing a stop over on a road trip, but our stay was very comfortable and our dog enjoyed the yard to run and play in. We would stay again!"

This is an older home that has been beautifully renovated and decorated. The location is a quiet residential neighborhood. The bedding and towels were high quality. The kitchen had everything I needed. The two beds (one quite firm and the other softer) were very comfortable. There was a small, private patio area in the back where it was nice to sit while drinking my morning coffee or having a glass of wine in the evening. The large dining table in the kitchen also served as a good workspace for my computer and the wifi worked very well. There were no issues with the neighbors in the adjoining duplex. Would definitely stay here again!"

All in all, it was a great stay and I would recommend this location to a friend or family to stay at. I certainly stay here again next time I am in town."

Check-in was a breeze thanks to Matt's clear instructions, and I was delighted to find the place impeccably clean and in excellent condition upon arrival. The attention to detail in the cleanliness and upkeep of the space truly exceeded my expectations.
Moreover, the location was ideal, providing easy access to all the attractions and amenities I needed during my stay. Whether it was recommendations for local restaurants or tips for navigating the area, Matt was a wealth of knowledge and made me feel right at home.

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I (and basset hound Daisy Mae) were traveling from St. Paul, MN to Lafayette, LA and made Monroe our final stop. This was a perfect little home for us - very clean and in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood close to the downtown areas. Everything was exactly as shown in the pictures. The backyard was fenced in so we could let Daisy Mae sniff around without worry of traffic (but it's a pretty quiet neighborhood anyway). Monroe was a great town as well. Had coffee and lunch at Standard Coffee and it was an amazing find if you're particular about coffee, and their lunches were above and beyond the expected coffee-house fare. We'd definitely stay at this place again on our next trip, though it may be more of a destination next time."

Amanda sets you up with water and snacks right off the bat, and her home was spotless. Our dogs enjoyed the fenced yard while we unloaded the car and settled in. Thanks to her list of restaurants we even ordered in some local fish and chips.
Amanda is incredibly responsive via text and even sent a note where we could find extra blankets if needed that night. We consider this place a top stay for a road trip and hopefully we’ll be back again next year!"

Stayed with a pet","We’ve stayed in well over a dozen Airbnbs (5 in the past week) during a North to East and now Coast to Coast roadtrip. Amanda’s place was my best night sleep, hands down.
The place had a nostalgic feel with a mix of vintage pieces, modern furnishing, with beautiful accents, some old, some new. Thoughtfully and tastefully decorated to give you a sense of warmth and comfort.
Rated cutest kitchen ever!
Rated squeaky clean!
Rated most well-lit fenced in back yard for the pups!
If we ever pass this way again. Amanda’s place will be our pick for a place to rest our travel- weary heads.
And Amanda was a prompt and helpful communicator who also left us a nice snack basket.
We highly recommend this sweet spot!"

Amanda’s place was exactly as described and we appreciated the local food recs (even ordered a pizza for the list which was delish!). We had our two boxers with us and appreciated the fenced yard which allowed us to unload our car with ease and peace of mind for our fur kids.
Amanda was very quick to respond when I had a check out question, and even let us check out a few minutes late to accommodate my husband taking a work meeting! Internet was top notch (my husband is a software engineer so internet matters a LOT to us) and the bed was super comfy.
We will be back when we pass through next month!"

Amanda was so kind and surprised us with a complimentary snack basket with waters. She knew we would have a late afternoon arrival and left the front porch and interior lamps on for us for when we arrived. We will definitely be booking her home on all our future visits to Monroe. Thanks, Amanda, for sharing your home with us!"

Once we arrived, the place smelled clean, was well kept, and was a nice respite from the road. We ordered Indian food through Doordash, took showers, watched some TV, and slept before we got back on the road early the next day. The beds & couch were so comfy. While our visit was short, we will keep her place in mind if we are ever back in Monroe. It’s a quiet, peaceful neighborhood but close to many restaurants and stores if needed. Check-out instructions were simple and clear."

The property was well kept on the outside with a spacious backyard for our dogs. The location is very central to all of Monroe, so whatever the reason you’re visiting, the location is great! The neighborhood is safe & quiet. The inside was spotless and comfortable! This was, hands down, the cleanest pet-friendly listing I’ve stayed at and there was no animal odor. The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking should you be staying long enough to utilize the refrigerator space, range & oven. The water pressure in the bathroom was good & the bedding was comfortable. I highly recommend this property for your stay in Monroe and won’t hesitate to book Amanda’s listing again!"

Stayed with a pet","Please beware that there are several unmarked tripping hazard ""steps"" inside the house such as the bathroom threshold, laundry room threshold, and a line between the kitchen and living room. The one at the bathroom is especially difficult to see as it blends into the floor. I hurt my knee on this step the first night and spent the entire next day in bed.
The walkway leading up to the house is wood and quite uneven which could also be a tripping hazard.
The fence was down upon arrival (after verifying with the host that the yard was fully fenced for our dogs). It was down due to repair and was fixed the next morning but a heads up would have been appreciated before arrival.
The doors stick and can be very difficult to open at times.
The property was clean, the bed, and couch were comfortable."

Amanda and Robert were totally awesome hosts even opening their personal home to me on Fourth of July. Amanda went above and beyond the call of a host numerous times and responded to my questions and needs ASAP. This awesome little house made my World Horseshoe Tournament 3 weeks, way better. I personally know 4 situations will my friends that was just horrible with their ABnB whilst there and they were jealous of mine. If you're looking for a Holiday Inn, go there. If you're looking for an awesome house at a totally reasonable price that you can feel home in. Contact Amanda. I personally expressed my feelings to Amanda and would recommend this house in a heartbeat. Thank you again Amanda and Robert. God bless, Gerald"

Stayed a few nights","Amanda’s property was a quaint home. It reminded me of visiting country relative where it’s charming and comfortable. The neighbor and his excited pooch alarmed us when we pulled up (we’re not pet people) but he quickly put us at ease.
The house sits on a corner so expect to hear passing traffic at night…thankfully not much at all. That’s just a tip for light sleepers. You might want to sleep in the room to the right. The beds were comfy. Linens were fresh. This house is fully stocked…snacks included. Squeaky floors and squeaky clean dishes (can you tell that I can be a bit persnickety?? 😆) My main negative (though not enough to alter my rating) would be the shower. Warm water with great pressure but I’m not sure if the stains were rust or mold. Bring flip flops if you’re weird about things like that.
If I return to Monroe, I would look for something more modern but that’s ONLY because it’s my preference. That in NO way reflects on this home. Having said that I WOULD recommend it."

We watched the sunrise and sunset on the bayou, daily, but we also walked ULM’s campus every day. The kitchen is so well appointed we never left once we arrived with our groceries. We played corn hole with the kids in the backyard and games at the dining table. The two tables seating 10 each gave us more than enough room for all! It slept all 10 people in our party very comfortably and would sleep many more. I highly recommend Judi and this property to anyone visiting the Monroe area. We will be back!

The amenities were amazing and you will not be in need of anything outside of buying your own food and drinks. The house has been remodeled and everything inside and out feels fresh. The beds were comfortable and there is enough space for 4-5 families to move freely.
If you are staying for a game, you are directly across from the grove and can walk to any tailgate in <5 min.
One of the best stays I've ever had and I hope this owner continues to enhance more properties near campus! Fantastic stay."

Stayed with kids","My family of 6 had a great stay at Gabrielle’s place. There were a few minor items that need a little attention/repair, but nothing substantial. The kitchen is fairly well stocked with utensils, pans. The house is adorable and very comfortable. We had some issues with a dog barking at the neighbor’s house, which we did message about. Not much can be done by Gabrielle about this, but it made it difficult to be out back and was disruptive late at night - it eventually quieted down and we slept fine though. All in all it was a great stay, and we will likely stay again when we visit family again."

The bedrooms were suitable for our needs. The best home amenity was having enough cooking ware and eating utensils for our group of 6. The only small issue is not having a front porch light, but the area was peaceful even with the school being across the street. We wanted to take pictures by the Tiger sign but half of the sign was inoperable, so we took most of our pictures out on the deck which was picturesque. Would recommend and use again when coming to town for a vacation, if available. Also, the hostess was sweet and gave quick responses."

The grill and backyard were great for both my parents, siblings and small children who visited us and live in the area. My husband and I were both pleased with the kitchen, bathrooms and living spaces. The mattress was a little firm for our taste, but that is a preference thing. Additionally, there were some birds nesting in the fireplace in the primary bedroom that needed to be cleaned out. Occasionally, they’d make chirping sounds (as birds do). It was kind of nice and kinda annoying at the same time. I’ve given that feedback to Gabrielle, so it’s likely been resolved. We will certainly be back!"

Stayed over a week",Joshua and Melissa’s place is wonderful! I stayed there for three months while doing a clinical rotation at a nearby hospital. I felt extremely safe in the neighborhood. It was an incredibly quiet and private space. Additionally it was so incredibly clean when I moved in. I would definitely recommend staying here!

Stayed one night","I have one complaint about Joshua and Melissa's space. It's that we couldn't stay longer! The location was very easy to find, close to I-20 and eating places. We were pleasantly met at the door by Melissa and ushered into a very unique space with the basketball court, bedroom, bath, and kitchen area. I have to admit that we had been in four previous b&bs on our trip, so I had forgotten the details on this spot and didn't realize there was also the shared space including the shared pool, living space, and BBQ area. We were only there one evening, so we didn't see that part and can't leave a review for it. The bedroom was cozy and the bed comfortable. The bathroom is very spacious and well stocked. Joshua and Melissa were very responsive to our questions. We will definitely try to stay here again and use all of the space and amenities! I think you'll enjoy your stay here!"

Stayed a few nights",WONDERFUL! We really enjoyed our stay. It’s very unique with the indoor basketball court. When you first enter the apartment you walk into the basketball court area. But we loved it. We are both active and we really enjoyed just shooting around in the evenings. I could not even find anything else like this at this price point. Bedroom is cute and bathroom is huge. And The area to chill and entertain is by the pool. But having the pool area right there was nice and I’m sure we would’ve enjoyed it more if it were a bit less humid . This place was a great find and real gem. The host was very responsive when we had a question or need. Would definitely stay again

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our 2 night stay here! It was me and 3 kids ages 4, 8, and 12. I also had my 1 year old grand daughter for a day. She crawled around all over the place, including the basketball court. The place was so clean that her knees and hands weren't dirty at all afterward! If you have kids, you know how impressive that is for a nightly rental. The kids enjoyed playing basketball. We all enjoyed the pool. The host was very responsive to any questions I had and helped me when I needed to edit my reservation at the last minute. They also set up an extra floor mattress for us, which I really appreciated. There were a few snacks and some drinks in the little refrigerator that we also appreciated. The beds were comfortable. The towels were soft and fluffy. The neighborhood was nice, and I felt safe going to my car at night. Everything was just like it is in the pictures. This is one of the best stays I've had away from home in a while! Thanks so much for having us!"
