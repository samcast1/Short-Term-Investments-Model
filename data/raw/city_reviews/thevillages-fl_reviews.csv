Stayed over a week","We stayed for two weeks and had a comfortable stay. We brought my 87 year old dad with us. It was true to the pictures, very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the 4 seater golf cart, and eating in the sun room/lanai every morning. Great area , easy to go to the pools and town squares at Sumter landing and Spanish springs. We had a great time!"

Stayed over a week","Enjoyed our month at Dan's place. The area is quiet and private. Close to both Spanish Springs and Lake Sumter Landing, as well as, shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. Golf cart is a great way to get around, although we only took it out a couple times. There is room for parking car in the garage with garage opener which was great for the first couple weeks, since weather was cool and wet for Florida. The house has everything you need for a short or long stay. Dan was quick to respond during booking and prior to arrival and checked in on us several times to see if we needed anything."

Stayed a few nights","Dan was/is a great host. This was my first Air BnB experience. I had to make some sudden travel arrangements to accommodate a sudden family death. He was very responsive and communicated very well and kept pace with how fast my plans were developing. Within minutes I had a response from Dan with instructions on how to find the place, how to access it, etc.
The property was exactly how it was pictured! Easy to get to, very clean, neat & organized. It was a very comfortable/welcoming place to be while being away from home without sacrificing the necessities.
Upon our next trip to the Villages, we will certainly be seeking out Dan again for a repeat visit!
Thanks again!"

Stayed about a week","I was in the Villages to attend a funeral and put a house on the market, in other words a stressful time. Staying at Dan's house was the perfect decision, communication with Dan was really easy, informative (and fast!), all my questions were answered immediately. The house itself is very pleasant and comfortable with two screened-in porches and it was the perfect place for me to relax. Very centrally located in the Villages, just a short drive to Spanish Springs or the other town square (can't remember the name) where there is entertainment and lots of restaurants. Of special note: really comfy beds and sheets. We didn't use the golf cart but the house is in a perfect location for that. I would recommend the place warmly. Thanks, Dan!"

Stayed a few nights","From the moment we walked through the door, we felt right at home. House had a great feel to it, unlike any nice hotel I've stayed at. Living area/Kitchen area had a nice warm welcome feel to it. House was furnished with great appliances, pots/pans, dishes and silverware already to be used and all excellent quality. Bedrooms all nicely decorated and made up with comfortable linens. Bathrooms pristine with great soft towels.
The saltwater pool was fantastic! My wife and I used it every day and evening after a full day with family and or dancing in the square. very relaxing and rejuvenating as well.
Gary has a beautiful home that is well taken care of. Fully outfitted with anything you may need during your stay in the Villages. Thank you, Gary, for opening up your home. We enjoyed every minute of it!"

Group trip","We were a group of 5 at Gary’s house in The Villages. As soon as we walked through the door we knew that our vacation started off perfectly and our opinion didn’t change over the next two weeks. We enjoyed the pool every day we were “home”, the temperature was warm and the pool and area well kept. Gary was proactive with information that we needed for our stay and when we had a question Gary responded immediately. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking and storage. We would not hesitate to book Gary’s house again."

A large community pool is just blocks away. We will book again!"

Stayed over a week","Absolutely wonderful Airbnb experience in The Villages, Florida! The property, situated on a corner, exudes a welcoming aura with its three bedrooms and a garage offering the option to park our vehicle securely. One of the standout features was the screened-off heated pool in the backyard, providing a delightful retreat. The electronic code-operated front door eliminated the hassle of carrying keys around, ensuring seamless access throughout our stay. Convenience was another highlight of this Airbnb. With close proximity to Win Dixie and Walmart (accessible even with a golf cart), stocking up on essentials was a breeze. Additionally, the Town Square (Lake Sumter Landing) was merely a five-minute drive or a leisurely ten-minute golf cart ride away, providing easy access to dining, shopping, and entertainment options."

The kitchen was outfitted with everything we could need.
Gary’s place is located on a corner lot and feels very private.

The salt water pool after a round of golf on a hot day was fantastic and the fact that Gary set the spa jets to come after our round each day was over the top! The house is clean and well appointed and all three beds quite comfortable. The house is quite close to the Havana country club which is a great spot for a nice lunch or dinner if you are looking for a change to going into town or cooking at home. Gary is a five star host!

He went above + beyond to assist us with a problem regarding getting our rented golf cart from town to our location. He was extremely kind + patient with our situation.

Stayed about a week",We had a very pleasant stay. The house was very clean and the photos and descriptions are accurate. Check-in and communication with Gary was easy. We enjoyed relaxing and excercising in the salt water heated pool each day and reading on the lanai. We took a bike ride around the nice quiet neighborhood. The location was convenient for visiting Dad at Sumter Place and dining at some of the Country Club restaurants. We hope to stay again in the future!

Gary was very accommodating after we decided to rent the golf cart and that was an added bonus to the stay. He is always available if you have a question and responds right away:)
There are a few cameras on the property -something that I have never been accustomed when renting airbnb before but they were not present in the indoor living areas or the back area of the pool.
My parents, who live at the Villages said, ""This is the best place you have ever rented!"" I agreed."

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed our stay at Gary's place in The Villages. We would consider staying there again and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.
The home is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood tucked away from the busier areas of The Villages, but at the same time those areas are just a short ride away whenever you want them. Lake Sumter Landing and the Colony Plaza shopping center are roughly equal distances away. There is a Winn-Dixie at Sumter Landing and a Publix at Colony, we visited both and preferred the Publix. We enjoyed the mature landscaping in this part of The Villages, especially during walks or bike rides.
The home has a split floorplan that worked very well for us and everything was very clean. Check-in was a breeze. The listing photos are very accurate but once we arrived we felt the home was even nicer than we expected. There are ceiling fans in every room and solar tubes in certain areas that brighten up the interior. Being on a corner lot with an oversized side yard was ideal for walking our small dog without potentially bothering neighbors.
We opted to add the golf cart to our rental and we're glad we did. It adds so much to the experience of The Villages. If you haven't driven a golf cart in The Villages before, we'd highly recommend watching some YouTube videos that cover basic operation and the rules of the road (paths, tunnels, avoiding roundabouts, etc.). A good one can be found by searching ""villages newcomers golf cart do's and dont's"".
Having a private pool available at the house was a big bonus. It was just the right size for cooling off after a warm day. We had a little confusion about the operation of the pool at first but got it sorted out soon enough. A tip for future guests is that you will have no doubt about whether the heater is on, it makes a low-frequency rumble when it is active but we did not find it bothersome. Also just as a frame of reference it took about 3 hours to heat the pool from 70 to 87 degrees which seems pretty reasonable given the volume of water. But that may not always be necessary.
As mentioned in other reviews, Gary is great with communication. We didn't need much but when we did, Gary was responsive, thorough and professional."

We spent most of our time relaxing in it, and it was absolutely lovely. Hot water, waterfalls, jets?! It almost felt like a jacuzzi more than a pool!

The snacks left were great when we got in at midnight and didn’t stop to shop before we got there. We only got the free pass and that was all we really needed. Glad we didn’t pay the 50.00. Never had to show our passes. It was very clean and spacious."

The house was very, very clean. The master bed is extremely comfortable, linens are quality. Kitchen is well set up for everything we needed. Add in a wonderful lanai and heated pool… this is a home we hope to return to when we are visiting family in the villages. And the location is great in a safe, attractive neighborhood that made it easy to travel to three of our family member’s homes in three different areas of the Villages.
Upon arrival we found a thoughtful hand written note, bottle of wine, cheese crackers and fruit to welcome us. We were in the area to visit my father who was in the ICU and Gary and his lovely, comfortable home made this trip much easier for us. He is highly responsive to questions and his house manager is also thoughtful, friendly and easy to communicate with.
Thank you Gary for allowing us to rent this great space."

Another selling point is the location of the house. We like to dine out a lot, and there are so many options nearby. Two of the country club restaurants are just a few minutes away by car, and we tried both of them. Also, Spanish Springs and Lake Sumter Landing are both easy drives.
The house itself is lovely, with an “old Florida” feel to it. Sofas are comfortable with floral designs, beds are four poster, and there are two roomy chairs in a sunny room right next to the sliding doors to the backyard. We did take a few dips in the pool, which was fun.
As a side note, I’ve never seen so many towels available at an Airbnb! Ditto with black felt hangers. Makes a difference, was just easier hanging up all of my clothing. I’ve been to other homes where hangers are in short supply and poor quality.
Recommended."

Stayed over a week","Lori’s home was amazing. Perfect set up. All furnishings were very comfortable which is a very important consideration when looking for a rental. Plenty of storage in bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen plus the garage!
The location is so convenient. You can walk to all the fun in Sumter Landing on the multi-modal trail, however that includes sharing the path with golf carts which at times feels sketchy. We usually took the golf cart or took the car. The golf cart is a huge bonus as that is the mode of transportation for most people in The Villages.
There are currently 4 Squares with one more being built. In these Squares, there are restaurants and live bands that play every day of the year. So much fun! As mentioned above- Sumpter is closest but they are all great.
So much to do in the Villages between golf, swimming pools, pickle ball, billiards, shuffleboard and so many classes & activities available to join.
This home is a gem!"

Stayed about a week","We enjoyed staying at Lori’s place as our home base for a week while visiting family in The Villages. The location is perfect. It is a very short golf cart ride or walk to the Lake Sumter Landing town center and the grocery store. You don’t even need to use a car. The home is spacious and is much bigger than the smaller villas that are located near Lake Sumter Landing. The area of the home that is typically a screened-in lanai in most villages homes is an enclosed climate controlled room giving the home much more interior space and an expanded living area. The provided electric golf cart was in great shape and makes staying in The Villages very convenient. The home was clean, comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. We would stay at Lori’s place again when visiting The Villages."

I was woke up right before that due to a situation I spoke to Amanda about which she brushed off. We were texting back and forth around 11pm about checkout instructions I was unaware of. All was fine and I was able to complete her checkout the next morning. There was a golf cart and was instructed to fill up if we went for a ride but there was no gas station within the distance I was comfortable driving with my children.

We did not use the golf cart. A burnt cup stain in the master bath on the sink . the screen in porch smelled horribly. No response from host. She asked for information and did not respond when asking if she recieved it. One way conversation from her. I should have stayed at hotel cheaper and cleaner.

Stayed a few nights","The house was very clean. The beds were very comfy. Large kitchen/family room area to hang out. We used the front porch a couple times to just hang out too. Convenient to pools, town squares, and shopping.
We had a couple issues with the golf cart and front door lock on the 2nd day and it was addressed quickly. Although we lost 1/2 a day using the golf cart, we had a car to get around that day.
My only main complaint is when airbnb's don't use white towels and linens so they can be washed on hot with added bleach. 1.Sheets/Towels were not white and we ended up re-washing all bed linen when we arrived as the cleaning instructions say for the guest to throw into the wash and start-I don't trust people to know if the right amount of detergent was used and it was even cleaned on hot water 2. Need less decorative pillows that end up on the floor and 2 more real pillows on each bed. Throw out the bath mat in the master bath and just use a towel mat that can be cleaned after each visit."

I felt secure with a guard posted at the gated entrance but was unable to contact Amanda for assistance locking the property during checkout at the phone number listed on the back of the door. The house was clean but I did notice some moldy sludge in the Keurig coffee machine. Guests are expected to wash all bedding & towels prior to the 10AM checkout; however, my towels smelled sour like they had been left in the washer too long from a previous guest. Very limited pantry (no cooking spices, sugar for coffee, foil, plastic wrap, bar soap or dryer sheets) Overall it was a good experience & would recommend it."

Stayed over a week","As the title indicates... this location is great. Not a very big house but plenty of room for two people. The home has very nice furnishings and the beds are awesome. We were very comfortable, stayed a full month and should have stayed longer. Since I am a golfer, the golf cart is a must have if you are staying in the Villages (TV's). With the golf cart I was able to ride to 5 or 6 of the Championship courses and a good number of executive ones. Getting around on the paths is a learning experience but once you get the hang of it you have a lot available within a 15 - 20 minute cart ride. If you are going, stay at least a month and Amanda will get you passes to use the pools, golfing and all activities (cost $50) and worth every penny. My wife signed up for different activities in the centers and drove around for various classes. With it you also get equipment like Pickel ball rackets and such... we did not have our own. I never met Amanda but she did check on our stay and I would definitely go back."

As for Pamela, she was great! Very informative and quick to respond to any questions we had. We cant wait to get back to Pamela's perfect home in The Villages.
There was nothing bad about this home and its location. Just perfect!! Thank you Pamela!"

Stayed with a pet","This was one of our favorite AirBnB stays. Stephanie went above and beyond being helpful. She was courteous, polite and stood out as the most responsive host we've dealt with since using AirBnB. The house is exactly as pictured with a beautiful, private backyard. We brought two friends with us and they loved the location too. They have a small service dog and were thrilled to see their four legged friend was welcomed. Anytime I had a question, Stephanie always texted me back instantly. The house is in a great location between Lake Sumpter and Brownwood. It has a large, well stocked kitchen, a beautiful screened in porch & landscaped backyard. It looks exactly as pictured. The house is well furnished and it was spotless when we arrived. The porch and backyard have comfortable furniture and the grill was clean and ready to use. I would encourage you to visit this property if given the opportunity, I can promise you won't be disappointed."

Stayed with a pet","Communications with Stephanie was the best I've ever experienced with using Airbnb. Although we didn't ask, she reached out and offered early check-in, which was a great surprise. She also gave a list of rec centers near by which was very helpful being that we didn't know our way around The Villages.
The backyard is totally private with a block wall across the back and privacy fencing on the sides. There isn't any grass back there, only concrete and rock, but our dog didn't mind doing her business on the rocks.
Golf cart was a big plus!
Lawn chairs aren't provided (you'll need them for some evening entertainment) but Stephanie offered to drop some by.
We brought a canvas beach-type bag which turned out to be a good idea for taking things on the golf cart (sun-screen, sun glasses, beach towel, etc) We also used it when we went to Daytona Beach for a day.
We had a great time!"

The location was quite central and a short golf club ride to groceries, gas, and sat quite near two different town centers. A couple particular things that stood out was how communicative Stephanie was, the beach towels that were available, and the spices available for cooking! I could have used a larger frying pan but that was so minor compared to all the extras that were provided. We highly recommend!!!"

We loved the layout, extremely clean, very organized, and had absolutely everything we needed and more in the kitchen. Stephanie was amazing allowing us a bit earlier check in due to a medical situation with a pup. We rarely ask this of a host, so we greatly appreciated her letting us do so. This place is truly a gem! The courtyard is a dream to sit and relax and so private. The golf cart was so much fun and we fit right in. Honestly, best rental around! We look forward to our stay next year."

Group trip",Nice roomy house. For our family it was close to other family members who live in The Villages and to Lake Sumter Landing. The golf cart was great. The only issue was a TV remote that looked like it was chewed by a dog

Stayed over a week","The whole house was clean and nicely decorated. It had plenty kitchen supplies and the beds were comfortable. The crafting area was well stocked and the dream box very organized. All the Cricut machines and supplies any crafter would need. Although I did bring a lot of my own card stock and supplies knowing I was going to be making specific projects to sell at craft sales I do at home, I had the opportunity to use the Maker and Explore 3's and Cricut Joy machines I had never used.
The house also came with a golf cart which was a lot of fun exploring the areas. We felt safe on our daily walks in the neighborhoods. Guest passes got us into most of the recreation centers. There were craft shows just about every weekend we were there.
We did have to get a hold of Alex when we were having ""user error"" issues with the TV and he was quick to come over and get us back to watching local TV. He was very responsive and we really enjoyed meeting and talking with him."

Shopping was within a 10 min drive. The square in town had nightly entertainment and restaurant galore. The whole area is pristine. Did not see litter anywhere. The Dream Box had ample craft supplies but stores were near by for anything else. The beds were comfortable and there is ample seating for everyone including any guests that came to visit. The lanai was beautiful to sit in for meals, coffee. Ample towels and bedding. Lots of closet space for storage. If you get a chance go to Mt Dora, great place to shop and eat, and do take the $2 boat cruise around the lake, well worth it after all the walking you do in town. Will definitely be going back. Can't say enough about our excellent host Alex. He was only a phone call away."

They even supply you with a golf cart to get around. That was fun!! I am already planning my next visit with my friends. I head home happy and rested from my stay at the Cottage.

Stayed over a week","The villa is wonderful. Great location within the Villages. Well furnished and clean with lots of amenities. Quiet neighborhood. This rental includes a golf cart and the information in the listing indicates that a waiver is necessary to get the keys to the cart. However, when asked about the waiver, the host indicated that it was no longer necessary to sign a waiver and the keys would be in the rental property. The cart was hit by another driver during the rental and the host expects the guest to buy a replacement cart for them, despite it being a minor accident and not getting an adjustor involved to assess the damage. Would not rent this property unless you have a clear expectation of your responsibility for the cart in writing."

Stayed about a week","Alex’s place was more than we expected and it is lovelier than the photos even. He and his Mom had thought of “EVERYTHING” and the stay was just awesome. The location is really great, as we really like Spanish Springs town square for dancing. It is reachable by golf cart or bike to Sumter Landing, but a little further. It is also nice and close by cart to El Santiago Rec centre for Pickleball, swimming etc. The addition of the Cricut crafting area was great as I had a broken wrist and couldn’t play like usual at Pickleball etc. If you know what you are doing it would be a lot of fun to create stuff. Alex & his Mom thought of everything and we “REALLY” appreciated all the food that was available in the kitchen as we did cook a few nights. The ability to have access to the golf cart was integral to the fun that we had in the Villages. Alex got our “Live like a Villager ID’s” for us so were able to enjoy all the amenities available. We would stay again!"

My friend and I came specifically to get away to craft together. When I let Alex know that's why we were there and may need to move a table to set up our own, he was so accommodating! He moved the table for us and had 6 foot tables set up for us with mats and Cricut when we arrived. It was so nice to not have to bring our own tables. The kitchen is well-stocked with everything you need to prepare and enjoy meals. There is a television with pretty much anything you would want to watch and an Alexa to enjoy music. Again, just like at home. Alex was easy to communicate with and responded very quickly to questions we had. Check-in and out was a breeze and we especially appreciated the later checkout. Most places want you out by 11. All in all a wonderful experience and we will be back! Thanks Alex!"

You enter into a four season lanai with a pretty turquoise wicker dining table and chairs [we ate all our meals out there] If the weather is nice you can open the windows and a lovely breeze comes through. If too hot, close them down and the AC keeps the room very comfortable. From the Lanai you use your own security code to enter this lovely crafting heaven! There is a HUGE crafting DreamBox and dining table on your left, and a comfy sitting area in front of your. The DreamBox is filled to the brim with everything a crafter could want on their visit. All the equipment, tools, paper, pens, markers, paper, vinyl, etc. There were extra six foot tables in garage to allow crafters extra room to craft. The kitchen has all the appliances you need to make your stay comfy, plus another dining area! The frig was filled with water bottles, with plenty of room for our own groceries there and in the pantry. The bathroom is a nice size with a great tub/shower. Both bedrooms have queen size beds and tons of pillows, nice size closets for all your clothing. There is a linen closet stocked with linens, a yoga mat, etc. This host provides a smart TV in sitting room and both bedrooms. You are able to get Amazon Prime, YouTube, Disney+, Netflix, and a host of other stations. The host has also provided Alexa+ so surround music is available plus of course Alexa is there to answer your questions.
Our stay was spectacular. The two of us went for a crafty vacation, to focus on crafting and nothing else. Melody Lane's Crafty Getaway was a dream. We will be back, just trying to figure out how often we can return. You will not be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","We so enjoyed our stay here. Clean, quiet, well appointed home throughout. Great communication with the kind and thoughtful host. We have been on the road for a month and have stayed in 6-7 different airbnbs and this has been the best. I know it is quite subjective, but, we found the MB bed the most comfortable of our trip. It was not too hard for me or too soft for my husband. When I return to this area again- and I will, to visit my parents - I hope I will find this airbnb available to stay at again!!"

Very pleased with our stay, we did feel right at home here. The King size bed provided restful sleep without backaches :-). The included golf cart is very nice. It drives well and comfortable riding. The Welcome notebook was helpful and well presented. It provided answers to some of our questions of how to work this or that. Nice job.

Group trip","Our stay and Debbie and Joel's home was absolutely perfect! They are exceptional hosts that provided all the information we needed for our stay. They were quick to answer any questions we had and made arrangements for our golf and guest passes. Their home is exactly like the pictures and the pool was a bonus for us! The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. We enjoyed seeing the wildlife in the pond area. Every room in the house was clean and tidy. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. The location was perfect, just a short golf cart ride to restaurants, bars and entertainment. We would highly recommend Debbie and Joel's home, you won't be disappointed!"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved staying at this location, it was wonderful. Hosts were very responsive and there were thorough instructions for all amenities. Everything was very well thought out with hampers in every bathroom, lots of indoor and outdoor towels, plenty of (beautiful turquoise blue) plates, bowls, coffee mugs, glasses, etc. The hosts thought of everything.
There are also desks in two of the three rooms if you need to work during your stay.
When we arrived the pool was heated to a perfect 85 degrees. It felt amazing to swim in and the water was clean and levels of chlorine must be perfect because it didn’t burn our eyes at all.
The netted/screen cover around the pool is great: it not only blocks any bugs or debris, but it also blocks the wind very well.
Everything about this home is in impeccable condition and bathrooms / closets, particularly in the master are GREAT.
We hope to stay here again in the future.
Highly recommend!"

Group trip","What a BEAUTIFUL home! So bright and clean with PLENTY of room for my entire family- 6 adults. The house was VERY comfortable and had all the amenities you might need plus 3 BR-KING sized beds with private bathroom each! We came for our niece’s wedding weekend so we were unable to spend much time in the house other than to shower, change clothes and sleep. However, it was so delightful to come back to this welcoming tranquil retreat after a long day of wedding events. The pool was inviting with its lighting and waterfall (we only got to put our feet in the water, but it was so soothing after a long day on your feet). Being able to park in the garage to avoid the rain was an unexpected , but much appreciated perk. Debbie and Joel have a notebook with all the information you might need regarding the house, the neighborhood and the surrounding entertainment venues. If you ever have a chance to come down to this part of FL, be sure to contact Debbie and Joel! You will be glad you did!"

Be sure to rent the golf cart - it was so much fun touring around The Villages on the golf cart and so much easier than driving a car. The price was a bargain considering all you get - each bedroom has a king-sized bed, en-suite bathroom, there’s a private heated pool, etc… WE LOVED OUR STAY.

The location was convenient to all major shopping and food choices as well as my parent's home in Wildwood. The home was exactly as pictured and as clean if not cleaner than any other I have stayed at in the Villages. Loved that we were given a gate 'card' and the garage door opener. LOVED the room darkening curtains! (they should be in every home!) Really valued the 2 king & 1 Queen size bedS. It was greatly appreciated that the host left extra coffee, sugar and spices, shampoo and soaps for us. Also very much appreciated that the coffee was NOT keurig but had a single serve ability. Only downside for us (and it's only because we are NOT morning people) was the main road noise in the a.m. We always travel with earplugs, so just be aware. All other times of the day were peaceful. Would def stay again! Note: nearest adult swim pool is on Bailey Trail...not Seabreeze. Great host. Excellent value."

Rick’s place felt like home. It was hard for us to leave. The furniture was very nice and comfortable and the house was spotless. From pots/pans to linens/towels, everything we needed was provided and in good condition.
The area was perfect. The neighborhood was great for morning walks and the town square was a pleasant 16 minute ride on the furnished golf cart (we loved that convenience).
We look forward to visiting again when we can stay longer.

Close to the Town Squares and the Pools were only a few blocks away. Golf cart added to the nice experience, easy and fun to use to see the sights aound The Villages! Our host Rick even called us to make sure eveything was as promised. Hopefully, we will get the opportunity to make future trips. Thank you Rick for allowing us to stay at your home. WE'LL BE BACK !!"

The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans, dishes, utensils, spices etc. The gas golf cart was definitely a plus. We used it to get to the pools during the day and to the square at night to listen to music. We had a great time, and we would definitely stay there again."

Rick's house is clean, updated and had everything we needed to have a relaxing, fun experience in The Villages. The location is excellent and just a short drive to all 3 Town Squares where we enjoyed nightly live music. Rick not only provided helpful communication online, he left a detailed binder with all the information we needed to have a great vacation. We especially appreciated the extremely quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed about a week","The House was amazing! Clean, Comfortable, and in a Great, Peaceful, Quiet Neighborhood located a short Golf Cart Drive away from the Town Squares. Our host, Rick created an information book for his guests that had info on everything you might need during your stay. Everything was well maintained on the property, including the golf cart which was a great bonus. Rick even left us a welcome basket full of goodies. (Nice, Unexpected Touch!) The screened in lanai off the Florida room was where we spent a lot of our time. It was spectacular. Rick was quick in his response time, in case you needed anything. We plan on returning in the future, and we will hopefully get the opportunity to lease this home again."

The house is super clean and have all amenities and also a late model gas golf cart that really adds value. If there is one thing that can be improved is that the bushes outside tends to steal the sunlight at the patio and in the living room, and maybe they should be trimmed. The guest bedroom has a very nice office setup that works great. We would like to come back!!"

If you are a golfer, this is the place to be. If you're looking for dancing, restaurants, bars and a great town square to hang out in, you have three to choose from in the area. This place is amazing. And the neighborhood people are all so friendly. Lake Sumter Square is the place to hang out. Live music EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. It’s like... spring break for adults. I was here a week and now have new friends. Thank you Rick."

That was a real treat and very different from most places that the furniture is uncomfortable. The space had everything that I needed and even a golf cart that I could use to check the area out.

Overall, this is a good to great place to stay and it’s economical based on what we paid for. There were a few minor issues that we encountered which may be typical of any Airbnb, but I addressed them to Jennifer and she was very diligent and responsive about them (bathroom floor mats were soak and wet when we got there, screws fell out of chairs when we sat down, smoke detector started going off when there was no smoke due to low battery, etc.). The facility was very decorative, clean, and nice and served our purpose there. We enjoyed the golf cart and I put air in the tires for Jennifer which were low/flat. Jennifer was a great host and I let her know about the minor issues that we had while staying at her Airbnb."

Stayed with kids","Jennifer’s place was very cute. The living area and kitchen were in the main area when you enter the house. I did have a hard time finding the pots, pans, and cooking utensils. It might help to include the locations for those items in the information binder. The bedrooms are decently sized with a king size bed in the master, a single and a queen size bed in the 2nd bedroom. There were two bathrooms, one in the master and another in the hallway; both wee a good size and had towels.
The house itself is close to a few different pools. We tried a few but I found them my kids like the pool called at Riverbend Recreation the best since they were able to walk into the pool themselves. We ventured over to Brownwood Town-square one night and also Lake Sumter Town-square two nights because the first night we went the shops were closed.
It was a great experience for myself and my kids. I will definitely be referring friends and family as well as possibly booking another stay later this year"

Everything about this experience was perfect. If I could give 10 stars I would! Jennifer was an amazing host, quickly responded to any questions, always pleasant. The house was perfect for our needs. Very clean, all the comforts of home. We spent our days by the pool, the adult and kids pool are a quick golf cart ride from the house. We also visited the Sugar Cane adult pool which is near our friends home, more of a car ride vs a golf cart ride. The pools were all very clean and everyone was very friendly. Our friend took us out every night to a different neighborhood square so we could experience different areas of The Villages. Overall an amazing experience. We’re a group of ladies in our 40’s and we had a blast! Definitely doing this again!"

The house was very clean and the location was close to Brownwood and walking distance to a family pool. The beds were uncomfortable for us throughout our stay and because of this we left a few days early. There were no blue chairs and table as seen in the pictures for the front patio. It would have been nice to sit outside as we didn’t use the table at the side of the house. There was also no BBQ for use. I think a few upgrades would improve this listing such as upgraded mattresses, pots and pans, toaster and it would be nice to purchase a kettle for the kitchen as well. We had a minor inconvenience with the master bathroom but Jennifer did her best to get it fixed for us."

Renters shouldn't have to guess what stains are, the mattress should have been replaced. It was significant. We slept separately in children's beds in the second bedroom.

Stayed about a week","We review Airbnb rentals according to our experience and have no reason what so ever to make false statements.
There were some issues with this rental and Airbnb is aware of them.
The guest passes that the listing states are provided by the host were not. We had to go and get them on our own.
The WIFI went out during our stay, yes-these things happen-but I think it is extremely unusual for us to have to be at the rental for the repair tech to arrive and remain there until the problem was fixed.
Both of these things were an inconvenience for us, as they would be for most people while on vacation. However, when we requested a nominal amount to be refunded to us because of this, Jennifer stated that "" Internet is a luxury, not a requirement so your choice to make it a big deal and spend the time fixing it is not my problem."" The issue with the guest passes received a similar response, ""The guest passes are also not a required perk of your stay.""
Keep in mind both of the items are listed as available amenities.
The home itself is only surface clean. In every closet in the home there are personal items stuffed in the corners on the shelves and the floor. There was food in the refrigerator that was out of date and there was laundry left in the washing machine from the previous guest or the housekeeper. These things didn't effect us because we didn't use the closets or the washing machine and we never eat any food left from previous guests or the host, it's just an FYI for future guests.
We always communicate through Airbnb so we have a record of all communications, and we also are in the habit of taking a lot of pictures of things we will be reviewing in case they would be needed.
We travel extensively and this is the first time we requested a refund of any kind from any host.
We would not recommend this rental to friends or family."

Stayed a few nights","I would not book here. The owner does not have the requisite lifestyle pass and is relying on neighbors to provide 'guest passes' to her renters. This is not the way it's supposed to work. Owners are supposed to relinquish their passes temporarily to their renters.
The neighbor being relied (not mentioned in the ad) on was away and unavailable to make golf reservations for us. We asked to be let out of the lease.
Therefore, we wasted 3 days of our vacation and incurred fees through air b&b.
We rented through the Villages Property Management company."

Even the neighbors next door were very nice! Having the van and golf cart was so great to get around to the grocery store nearby. Which brings me to location! So great to have a grocery store so close and shopping nearby as well. We would have taken advantage of the live music in the square but our six week old son wasn’t having it. Jennifer herself does very well with communication and is very nice to deal with. If I find myself traveling to the Villages again I will certainly look to see if this place is available!

Stayed with kids","Jennifer’s place was wonderful. It was clean, quiet, and spacious. The beds were very comfortable and we were close to many conveniences. Jennifer was quick to respond to our questions and we were very happy with this house!"
