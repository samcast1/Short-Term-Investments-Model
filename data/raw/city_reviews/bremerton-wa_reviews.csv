Stayed about a week","Our stay at Gram's Waterfront Cottage was wonderful! The cottage exuded a cozy charm that made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. The serene waterfront location provided a peaceful retreat, and the views were simply breathtaking.
The attention to detail in the cottage's decor and amenities was evident, and we appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout the space. Whether we were enjoying a quiet evening by the waterfront or sipping coffee on the deck while watching the wildlife, every moment felt special.
Einar & Dawn were wonderful hosts, offering a warm welcome and helpful tips for exploring the area. Their hospitality made our stay even more enjoyable.
Overall, I highly recommend Gram's Waterfront Cottage for anyone looking for a relaxing getaway. Thank you,Einar & Dawn, for a much needed ralxing stay!"

It was peaceful, beautiful, quaint, and reminded me of my grandmother’s house. This vacation checked all the boxes, and the bed was SO comfortable.
Please know we will be back to enjoy another stay here, we can’t recommend it enough!"

Stayed a few nights","I always recommend self care to my clients. Part of that self care is spending time with yourself to shed the scales of stress and to recenter. Yoga and meditation are great but just to be with oneself and get away from the “obligations” of modern life: work, family, friends, home stuff. This is a beautiful scenic, private location perfect for this. It has a sizable back yard with luscious grass to walk barefoot on, in addition to being right in the water. I counted at least six seals swimming across the bay. They return to their home around two hrs prior to sunset. The place is clean, small but cozy, and has all the necessary amenities. The hosts are gracious and friendly with their communications. I am definitely bookmarking this gem. It’s perfect for any busy Seattleite that needs space from the city. A quick trip on the ferry and boom ya there. It’s also walking distance to the eateries and bars. I loved it."

Stayed a few nights","Gram's Cottage is a real treasure; this was my second stay recently. The location is unparalleled, especially on a beautiful sunny weekend. This time I spent time on the covered porch watching numerous sea mammals surfacing as they swam by right in front of the cottage. Also, quaint boats of all kinds were fun to watch. Beach access in front of the cottage is easy with an excellent set of sturdy stairs. Quiet, charming & restful. Nearby Saboteur Bakery is a must; they sell-out early."

Chandelier over the bed was fabulous! Well appointed cottage is easily walkable to a number of good restaurants and a couple blocks long retail district. Heaters were easy to operate and did a great job of making the cottage cozy in winter. Thanks for a great stay!"

Beautiful Views even when it raised watching from the Big Window or porch. Nice being able to do laundry, collect sea shells, comfortable bed, linens, kitchen ready to use. Loved being able to set up my camera/tripod to take pictures of ferries, sea otters, anything coming up or down via the water. Sadly, we did not get to meet Millie. Maybe next time we come back and if available we will definitely stay at this cottage."

It’s stocked with everything you could possibly need and walkable to several restaurants and a small grocery store. One of the days of our visit was quite smoky outside due to the WA wildfires so we just hung out in the living room and played board games and enjoyed the spectacular views of the water and wildlife. This is definitely our go-to place to stay when visiting our son and his girlfriend in Bremerton!

I was working from the cottage for much of my trip and it was lovely to watch the sea otters in the water, humming birds at the window feeders, and even seagulls chasing off a bald Eagle and later chasing off a red tailed hawk.
Friendly walkable quiet neighborhood. The space is great for two people and the couch pulls out if you’re not sharing the queen bed. The bed is comfortable and the pillows are great. I’m definitely coming back and have family who plan to book separately!"

The cottage is very well appointed and cozy and the view nothing short of amazing. We find ourselves staring out the window often at ferries, seals, and low flying cormorants. The neighborhood is very walkable with several great spots for dining and/or take out. Although this stay was short and the weather a bit uninviting for outside communication, we have had some great chats with Dawn in the past and have always found Einar and her to be affable, warm, and helpful.
We have already booked a summer stay!
We are truly grateful to find such a great place to rest, read, write, and recharge!"

Stayed a few nights","What a darling cottage, we had such a wonderful stay here! Check in was a breeze, the cottage was immaculate and beautifully furnished. The bed was very comfortable, the linens and towels are of excellent quality. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you would need and even some extras. We really enjoyed sitting on the porch watching the ferry go by, and saw sea lions, otters, tons of cormorants, plus a Belted Kingfisher and the two amusing resident hummingbirds. The location is perfect: you're right on the water in a quiet neighborhood, but you're also in walking distance of several great restaurants: La Fermata, Hound & Bottle, The Boat Shed. Even if you're not a morning person, getting up in time to hit Saboteur Bakery when they open is worth it for their exceptional pastries. If you want to go slightly farther afield, the Puget Sound Navy Museum, the USS Turner-Joy, and the Kitsap History Museum are just across the Manette Bridge and worth the trip. Vintage shoppers will love the Manette Trading Company, Manette Antiques, and Ish Vintage. We don't usually repeat our Airbnb stays, but we'll definitely book Gram's Waterfront Cottage again!"

It was very romantic all the fun touches in the home and decor and the bed was very comfortable and fluffy towels. I would love to return here when we can that's how nice it is. Lots of ships passing by and boats and lots of birds flying across the water that was so relaxing! You won't be disappointed.

Stayed over a week","Gram’s Waterfront Cottage is our go-to place for our summer vacation. I look forward to being there every year. The location right on the water can’t be beat! It’s fun to watch the ferries go by and see the cormorants skimming along the waves. The cottage itself is spotlessly clean, very well outfitted, the towels befit a 5 star hotel, and the bed is comfortable. There is a full sized washer and dryer, and a pantry stocked with spices and staples. The kitchen is equipped to cook full meals, but if you’re not inclined to do that, several good restaurants are nearby. Down and Einar are excellent hosts, ready to answer any questions or solve any problems (not that we’ve ever had any)."

We had great weather so we ate dinner each night at the table outside and listened to the waves and watched the boats go by. The house is cute and well-furnished (bed is comfortable which is always important). Everything seemed clean and the water pressure in the shower was great. Despite the proximity of the houses on either side, there was not much noise and we had a very quiet time overall (the backyard feels very private). Hosts were very responsive to questions and even let us know about a submarine going by shortly after we arrived. The cat Minnie also came and visited with us a couple times which was fun. Overall, highly recommend!"

We were lucky enough to catch some harbor porpoises and seals swimming about and enjoyed feeding Minnie, the neighborhood outdoor cat. The home is conveniently situated about 10 min from the ferry terminal and within a few minutes from a small grocery store, and some bars/restaurants. I would recommend checking out Saboteur which is a tiny bakery with a small selection of french pastries. The internet also worked great for streaming Netflix, so I assume it should suffice should you want to work remotely from here. We hope to stay here again in the future and hopefully bring our boat next time to do some fishing and crabbing around the area."

It was perfect for our family of 3, but would also accommodate more. My daughter loved sleeping on the pull out sofa, and there’s even a cot if needed. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the ferries and even watched a Navy ship go by. We loved drinking our coffee and watching the sunrise and sunset and the neighborhood cat Minnie was an added bonus! (My daughter was THRILLED about her!). We visited Poulsbo (about 30 mins away) and it was an unexpected delight! We had such a lovely time and can not wait to come back!"

The view from the living room window was spectacular and we saw many seals swim by while we just relaxed on the couch with coffee. Our 4 month old was with us for this first trip away from home and she did great. Dawn provided a pack & play which was very helpful. Definitely recommend the cottage for some cozy R&R in a soothing and scenic area. We’d happily stay again!"

The cottage had everything we needed including items for our 7 month old and a full kitchen and laundry. The setting is very serene and quiet while still being a short walk to shops, restaurants and a short drive to the ferry. We highly recommend this little gem in Bremerton. Thank you for the wonderful stay!"

It feels very comfortable and very modern. I just happened to be staying here during my birthday and Dawn was thoughtful enough to leave a card and a bottle of wine. If you want a peaceful getaway close to the Seattle area this is the place. The value of what you get here is so much better than what you can get at a nearby hotel. It's an easy and scenic 15 minute walk to get to downtown Bremerton where you can easily take a ferry ride over to Seattle. I will 100% be back to this airbnb the next time I choose to take a trip to the Seattle area.

Stayed a few nights","Wendi is a wonderful host. She adjusted her schedule to meet me at this stand-alone one-story, one-bedroom house. Wendi tastefully furnished the unit which provides comfortable seating in the living room and dining area. Both are adjoined with the kitchen so that no matter where you are in the front rooms you have a view of the water. Wendi provided great touches to make this holiday visit very comfortable: a welcome tray of fresh fruit, a jar of hot chocolate, a bag of marshmallows, and snacks. She went the extra mile by having a Christmas Tree for me to decorate. This topped the experience of spending 5 days at Erland’s Beach. The pictures that appear in the Air BnB site are exactly what I found-what you see is what you get. The weather was such that I was not able to use the outside BBQ grill or sit on the spacious porch. I was able to have fun with my two grandsons on the pickle ball court located on the property. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet place to rest."

Jacque asked ahead of time how old our child is and left toys in the bedroom for him. We played all the board games and did the puzzles she left as well. The property is so peaceful and beautiful. We took the row boat out both days we were there (lots of jelly fish to see!) and ran through the sprinkler in the back yard. It was the perfect getaway from the city.

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely loved this home and will definitely book again when returning to Bremerton! The photos don’t do this place justice. The sunroom, walk to the water, the fresh cookies on arrival, and the overall thought that went into preparing the home was everything.
This home is very family friendly, with activities and toys for kids and even the pack-and-play!
Thank you Jacque and Stu for everything!"

She was a wonderful host and included many thoughtful touches that made us feel very welcomed. There are a handful of houses nearby that you can see but it’s a very peaceful and quiet area. We hope to stay again in warmer weather so we can use the wonderful waterfront bench and great closed-in porch.

Stayed a few nights","There was no shortage of delicious baking. Fresh baked cookies at check in, for starters. There was an issue with one room losing electricity due to a faulty transformer outside. Hosts went up up up above the clouds and beyond by being apologetic in the form of bringing fresh baked scones. If you're going to be apologetic, BAKING is the way to do it. These hosts set a great example to all other hosts, and should run seminars to teach aspiring hosts or current hosts looking to up their host game. The house itself is tidy, era appropriate (1950's) with every conceivable necessity and comfort required to be comfortable while being real-world affordable."

We felt immediately at home the moment we walked through the door of this charming vintage cottage. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the location is secluded and quiet yet minutes away from restaurants and stores. Jacque and Stu are kind and gracious hosts and even had yummy frozen fruit bars awaiting us when we arrived on a 90 degree day. Those icy treats were so refreshing as we sat on the seawall dangling our feet in the picturesque Oyster Bay.
The Kitsap Peninsula is a lovely place to explore and this home is truly a gem!"

Stayed over a week","We could not have asked for a more perfect home away from home than this charming house, nor more gracious and conscientious hosts. We were here for almost a month, and enjoyed every minute of this comfortable home. The kitchen has all you need, the beds are comfy, parking is convenient, and the house was immaculately clean. We loved all the windows, especially the sunny breakfast nook and the glassed in porch with large screened windows, the shiny hardwood floors, and the vintage touches!
The location was very nice, with a neighborhood feel, and convenient to our daughter, son in law and grandson who we had come to visit. Jacque and Stuart welcome their guests to make use of their waterfront, which is quite lovely, and their beach toys. Unfortunately we did not have the time this trip or the weather to really take advantage of this, but hopefully we can do so on a return visit. You can see a slice of the water from the Airbnb, and it makes for a very pretty view.
Our hosts were so considerate, welcoming us with homemade cookies and a pack n play for when our baby grandson was at ‘our’ house. Jacque even shared some of her freshly made granola with us, and it was delicious and appreciated. So, bottom line, absolutely stay here if you have the opportunity - we are certainly happy that we did!"

The cookies were delicious and came with recipe. Jacque deserves the superhost title. I had trouble finding a bakery to deliver a cake and she stepped up to my pleasant surprise.

Stayed about a week","The Little Guest House on Oyster Bay is amazing! It is located in a beautiful, wooded area with a view of the bay, giving the feel of being far away in a secluded area, yet you are only a few minutes drive to all the conveniences of the outside world (grocery shopping, fast food, gas, etc.) Jacque and Stu have done an incredible job in creating a beautiful, charming, inviting, fun home. It’s like stepping back in time but with all the modern-day comforts. The kitchen has plenty of dishes, cookware, utensils, storage containers and even sandwhich baggies, foil and plastic wrap! There were books and games for kids and adults. They thought of everything! They even had a tide chart printed out for the week we were there…low tide was a great time to go down to the water to skip rocks and find lots of shells.
Jacque and Stu are super friendly and were always available to answer questions and assist in any way needed. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was the best it could be. It was the perfect place for our family, and we would go back there in a heartbeat! Keeping our fingers crossed that it will be available the next time we are in Washington."

They exceeded my expectations. You literally only need to bring your toothbrush and toothpaste. Little touches like beer in the fridge, fresh baked cookies, and plush throw blankets for the sofa. Jacque was always available by text before my arrival and throughout my stay. Anytime I'm in the area I will be booking again, IF there's an availability. My guess is it's going to be difficult to get a reservation in the future at this cute Little Cottage. Thank you both for making my stay so memorable. :-)"

The house was beautiful everything was very clean and neatly put together. Alex was extremely helpful,understanding, and very responsive. We felt very at home during our four day stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet cozy place to say. We would definitely stay again :)"

Stayed a few nights",Alex's little house is very cute and has a great stocked kitchen! The check in was super easy and so was parking. They provide coffee and tea which is essential to me. There is no A/C but there are a couple of floor fans that worked pretty well. Overall it was a great experience in a quiet neighborhood.

Stayed a few nights","Alex's place was exactly as described - though small, it was comfortable and the location worked perfectly for us as we had to have our car serviced nearby and had appointments in Silverdale. We found this a good base location. We took the ferry into Seattle twice while there which was an easy trip. We can also recommend Tony's Italian Restaurant and the Safeway was also close by. Alex was very responsive and we were able to check in a bit earlier and added a nights stay while there. The description is clear, this is a small house in a neighborhood of small homes with a bar/pub a few doors up. We had no noise issues."

Alex was very responsive and kind when it came to our communication. During hot days and nights, Alex provided two fans but the summers have been extremely hot so Alex gave me a tip: Open the living room window and kitchen window to get air circulation going and you should be cooled down! Other than that, thanks Alex - you’ve been great! :)"

We loved how quite and peaceful it was when staying there and Beth gave a lot of suggestions of where to go which I wished we had more time but we were at the ball fields watching my daughter play softball for her college. Beth was great to communicate with when we reached out to her and was very responsive. I knew if I had a question she would get it answered quickly. Beth was very accommodating. Definitely will stay there again when my wife and I visit again.

Stayed with kids","We are a military family in the middle of a cross country move and about to be living apart for a good while. We came to Washington to see my husband off and lucked out with finding this rental. It was an all around stellar experience. While the home is located off a semi busy road, we never had any issues or concerns. Parking was easy and accessible for both of our vehicles. Centrally located, you can walk across the street to Safeway or downtown, you can drive anywhere within a few minutes. The home was beautifully updated , well stocked with towels, linens, paper products, laundry detergent, coffee pods and even bottles of water in the fridge. Lindsay was beyond wonderful. Thanks for making our last week together feel like we were right at home together still."

Stayed about a week","This is really one of the most charming and comfortable apartments we have ever stayed in. I wish everyone could wake up and enjoy their coffee while savoring the view of the Olympic Mountains that can be seen through Eric's extraordinary picture windows. And if the weather gods have given you a cloudy day, you'll still find yourself on a beautiful, timbered hillside. The apartment itself has a clean, modern look that my wife and I find very inviting. On the practical side, you will have a well-stocked kitchen, a very comfortable queen size bed, a dish washer, a laundry room and a good wifi signal. Although the location feels pleasantly remote, in reality you will be just minutes away from good restaurants and shopping. To top everything off, Eric and Vicky are wonderful hosts. They made sure we knew how to find and access the apartment, and when we arrived we found it well stocked with arrival goodies and nicely decorated for the holidays. We hope they always keep the light on for us."

I can’t say enough good about their beautiful Carriage House. We look forward to coming back and recommend it and give it the highest of recommendations. It’s truly a gem.

Stayed a few nights","If we could give more stars for the value we would! My bf and I booked the Carriage initially because it was convenient and was in an area we had never explored. Over a 2 day stay we looked forward to coming back to the loft after spending the day in Seattle and in the nearby area. It’s only a few minutes from a ferry to Seattle if you want to explore the sound, and is also in a private and quaint area to go on beautiful walks along the water if you feel inclined. The property is definitely isolated, but in the best way! Quite literally had the best view of Mt. Olympus on a clear day, and the actual loft was spacious, modern, clean, and homey all in one. The host was super welcoming and took time to greet us, as well us giving us gracious space to enjoy our stay and offered immediate communication if necessary. We will find ourselves here once again if we plan a trip in the PNW! This is the perfect destination for you!"

Eric and Vicky were super responsive and accommodating to ANY questions or requests that we had, always going above and beyond. We have decided to stay longer and will be checking back in for the month of April! We feel as though we came as AIRBNB guests and will be leaving with new friends that we will be coming back to see!
They made us feel welcomed, comfortable and we don't want to leave! There is so much more we could say....but we will leave it at this: AWESOME experience and we will be back!"

Stayed over a week",This is probably one of the best Airbnb's we have stayed at. We chose this location because it was the halfway point for our destinations (National Parks & Seattle). It was perfect! Plenty of stores nearby for all your needs. This home is detached from the main house and you get all the privacy you need. The inside was decorated beautifully and had all the household items that we needed. We appreciated the board games to occupy us when the rain kept us in. The kitchen was fully stocked and we LOVED the homemade cookies that were put out for us! These hosts are exceptional and they checked in with us during our stay. We appreciate the communication! This home was absolutely lovely! THANK YOU!

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at AirBnBs for 10+ years and have met several hosts. Vicky and Eric have raised the bar for me. The place itself is absolutely stunning, serene, modern, charming, stylish design, every item - from soap dish, to pillows, to bedsheets, to towels to Keurig coffee pod flavors, to getting greeted by your hosts and freshly baked cookies upon arrival, to vastness of high ceilings nestled around Olympics, lush greenery... makes this a gem in PNW! And definitely in Bremerton.
I woke up each morning to birdsong, surrounded by nature, and thoroughly enjoyed salted caramel mocha coffee and cookies, and snacks they provided. I explored nearly trails, parks (Lion's park is down the street), restaurants close by and looked forward to coming back to this sanctuary to read or just stare at the mountains. There are 2 Smart TVs, board games, comfy couch and fully stocked kitchen if you like to cook. You are less than 10 minutes to the Ferry terminal to Seattle.
Having said all this, what made my experience exceptional are the hosts. They are some of the most kind, thoughtful, generous, classy, down to earth people you will ever meet. I cannot wait to go back! And if you are reading this, and if you are lucky to find availability, book it!"

Stayed a few nights","Super clean. Much bigger then it looks in photos due to the super high ceilings. Loved the décor. Homemade cookies were amazing, cooked to perfection.
Things to be aware of, the driveway is very steep compared to what I’m used to in flat Ohio. Would have been terrified to drive a front wheel drive car if covered in snow. Internets fine (18 Mbps) for streaming with my Roku stick I brought even tho the TV has the smart app. The TV has surround system and is very nice. tv is much larger then it looks in the photos.
The directions were clear in how to get there but I didn’t pay to close attention to them. I set my waze to the place and it sent me 5 minutes away. MUST use google maps.
Overall wonderful place and people and would stay again if in the area."

Stayed a few nights","The Carriage House doesn't deserve a 5 star review, it deserves a 10! From the warm greeting we received from our host Eric, to the peaceful park-like setting, the Carriage House exceeded our expectations. Upon arriving, a little later than we had anticipated, we were greeted with fresh scones (delicious, Vicky) and everything we would need for coffee/tea in the morning. The property feels like you are in the middle of a lush forest/garden, but you are only a few minutes from everything that Bremerton/Silverdale has to offer. The bed and furnishings were comfortable and so much attention was paid to the small details. There were spa robes and even a little switch for mood lighting. :-) You won't be disappointed staying at the Carriage House, the property and the hosts are top notch. Thank you so much, Eric and Vicky! We are looking forward to staying with you again."

After the first night, we immediately booked again for a few weeks in the summer. The place gets such great reviews its usually booked— easy to see why. Eric & Vicki are wonderful hosts that came out to greet us when we arrived, and again when we checked out.

Warm chocolate cookies freshly baked by Vicky that were quickly wiped out in no time. The place was sparkling, and the hosts could not be more welcoming. Great communication. We had missed an opportunity to visit Eric and Vicky’s place in January because of the snow drift, and I was glad to have been able to make this time around. One late night, I got locked out, and Eric showed up in less than 5 minutes, and even replaced the lock the next day (though it was probably me). I felt safe and cared for and experienced a really nice stay with this family. I will keep this memory for long. Thank you!"

Bremerton is also a great launching off spot for visits to hiking and beaches along the hood canal, really lovely all around.
Couple of notes for awareness — the driveway in is quite steep, right away (I will admit to my first time turning in stalling my stick shift :/ ) and the internet is totally fine for watching movies after a day of hiking but not speedy enough for a lot of video calls without some delay (all the more reason to take a full vacation and enjoy the home and the area). A truly fantastic Airbnb with wonderful, kind hosts and the beauty of the northwest to match."

The only thing that would have made it absolute perfection is a more reliable/faster WiFi connection, I work from home and there were a few times I had to run to a coffee shop or use my phone hotspot in order to continue working. That is nothing about the wonderful hosting, it’s simply a trade off for the pristine location.
Thank you, Eric and Vicky, for hosting us and we will have fond memories of our stay to reflect on in the future. 💝"

It was a great place for a relaxing get-away. I hope to come back some day! The hosts were so kind to greet us and introduce themselves (from a distance) when we got there.

I really am going to miss it. Thank you for such a beautiful time. I really cherished the time I spent here and can’t wait to come back to visit. Love you guys. Stay healthy."

The location provided us access to everything we wanted to do from visiting Bremerton sites to proximity to the Olympic peninsula (and the AMAZING hiking we were able to do with a simple day trip). There were treats (honestly I think these are visitor specific) and tips for great activities and all of this combined really made this feel like home. This will become your favorite AirBnB!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved this private, cozy cottage with a view. Romantic space for two! Fireplace, enclosed porch overlooking the water, and deck with table and chairs. Nice touches everywhere…lighting, Keurig and electric water heating pot, very nice touches. Calming, fresh decor.
Sat on the porch in the am with coffee and watched the fog roll by. We had pizza and wine on the deck the last night. The bed was comfortable. Temperature control is by room so very flexible. Kitchen had everything you need and laundry equipment is nice. Appreciated having the essentials like paper products, soap…vs buying just to start your stay.
Shoreline access for walks and nearby ferry to Seattle were a plus. Note: plan around ferry schedule each way. Whale watching out of Port Townsend followed 5 Orcas and sighted a grey whale (hump and tail). Recommend the Toad House (5 minutes away) for pizza. Going to Seattle for dinner? Look up the Pink Door, eclectic upscale environment and excellent Italian food."

Stayed with a pet","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The unit is located on the same property as the owners but tucked away far enough that you have enough privacy. One of the cleanest Airbnbs we stayed at, and we appreciated how comfortable and spotless it was. The bed was definitely very lived in, and likely needs replacing soon as one side was fully caved in. Since we only stayed for 2 nights it wasn’t a huge issue but a longer stay would have likely caused some back problems.
The unit is located right off of a very busy road which we didn’t realize when booking, so we didn’t feel as comfortable letting our dog roam around the area as it felt a bit dangerous (no fenced in grass area) If you don’t travel with a dog it shouldn’t be an issue though!
Would recommend this Airbnb to others!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was great! full size kitchen made our stay incredible. I baked a bunch of cookies and not only was there a cookie sheet there but it was a heavy duty one by Wilton! Nice! the place was clean, nice, comfortable and close to the highway so easy access and close to all the places we needed for Bremerton and Silverdale. The only thing is internet is a bit slow. Other than that, we had a wonderful stay with great communication from the host. I highly recommend this facility!"

Apt was as advertised, small, simple, clean, host was responsive. Okay Wi-Fi but struggled with zoom a little, although host offered to let me work out of the office onsite, which was thoughtful. Nothing to really complain about!"

Erwin was a good resource for the area and respected our privacy. We stayed for 3 months for an internship and with that long of a stay, Erwin became our pseudo-landlord. As with all homes, they require maintenance, and when anything like that came up, Ewrin took care of it in a timely and considerate manner. Would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights",Erwin has the perfect place to stay at for yourself or as a couple. The entire place seemed as though it was brand new. The room has a number of big-paned windows that you wake up looking at nature outside that scored big ‘unique’ points. The breathable bed comforter was also very nice. The complete kitchen was useful and full size washer and dryer for any possible extended stay. The hand soap reminded me of English Leather cologne.

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Tom and Jean’s. The studio was plenty of space for two, especially given our days were mostly spent outside. Access to the beach at low tide, and a bench swing under grape vines were two of our favorites. Parking was snug, but doable. Noise is very minimal considering how close to the (excellent) busy restaurant nearby. We had lots of sea birds to watch, including bald eagles and cormorants, a seal snoozing on the dock next door, and Tom told us about the river otters that visited while we were there, though we missed them.
The location was perfect for us. We spent our time mostly walking. Crossing Manette Bridge we explored the waterfront Fountain Park, the Naval Museum, and ran out of time for the Turner Joy tour. Lots of good eateries, and met some great folks at The Shack on the marina dock. Another day we drove to nearby Lions Park and wished we’d had pickle ball equipment, but had fun walking the beach and exploring the park.
Tom and Jean 👏🏻"

This place is perfect for 1 or 2 adults max. Great restaurants just a single block away or relax on the patio with your coffee and watch the tide ebb and flow.
The bed is comfy and the kitchen amenities were very nice.
I stayed here for four weeks and was only awakened by an early garbage truck twice.

You can expect early morning noise from the trash and delivery trucks associated with the Boat Shed Restaurant next door."

Stayed a few nights","This is exactly what we were looking for when we wanted to visit Seattle but not stay in the city. The ferry is a short walk from Tom and Jean's wonderful place, and the ferry itself gave us time to plan our day or unwind from our time in Seattle, and the views on the water were amazing. The place itself is perfectly appointed and has everything you need for your stay. The bed was super comfy, the kitchen was set up like home, and the beach right outside the door was a wonder for a landlubber like myself. Seashells, waves, the tide, the smells, everything.
We never noticed the sounds of cars driving on the bridge, but we're used to city sounds having lived in the heart of Denver. The restaurant next door never presented an issue either (by the way, delicious!).
Tom and Jean were great with communication and were always available for anything we needed without ever being intrusive. We never actually needed anything because the place was perfect from the get-go.
Katy and I are already planning a return to Seattle when things open up more, and when we do we'd like to stay here again, it's so perfect. Thanks, Tom and Jean!"

Stayed a few nights","The description is quite deceiving. It is on the water however the deck that the quests have access too is quite small and hard to see anything from as it is I closed between two buildings. The shower head is very very small and in an awkward position and the shower itself isn’t very clean. The bed wasn’t very comfy and the head board hit the wall loudly anytime you moved. The sheets were dirty when we arrived and we did have to change them ourselves. (this was on the 4th of July so we weren’t too upset but it was inconvenient) For the price we payed this was quite disappointing especially because at least the cosmetic things could be payed more attention too. The last thing we were disappointed in was the fact that they appeared to be providing coffee and tea but were not stocking it so we were left with the coffee scraps from the last guests. This place was a bit overpriced for what we were getting. However We loved our trip to this sleepy little fishing town and location wise this home is wonderful. It just needs a bit of love, especially for the price at hand."

When I brought the issue up with the host, she was very aggressive, defensive, and ended up barging into the unit and telling me that my standards were too high, where the cleaning supplies were located to clean it myself, and telling me I should leave. This is the first negative experience I have had out of over 15+ Airbnb stays. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. I do not understand how they got a ""Superhost"" status, but please save yourself the pain and find another place to stay."

Note their are stairs to climb, but it's on the upper floor of a two story, and the view is nice. Didn't get to use the kitchen, but there are plenty of amenities . It was a little hard to street park when I got back late Saturday night, but only had to walk about a block... and it was after midnight, so I couldn't expect room at that hour. However, the neighborhood seemed safe enough and well lit.
I didn't need to contact the host, and that's a good thing . Well done, sir"

Street permit parking was required and unfortunately Tory is still in the process of renewing the parking permit.

The neighborhood is quiet, but you're just a few- minutes walk to shops and cafés in downtown Bremerton. We loved the place and would definitely visit again."

The layout is really nice, the bed was comfortable, the kitchen well stocked, the bathroom beautifully updated. Tory was available to answer any questions we had, and check in and out was easy and straight forward. And the location is great - easy walk to downtown and to Manette, and to a local park. All in all, highly recommended!"

The kitchen is perfectly stocked with dishes/cookware. Very clean. We felt at home. It was cold the first night we were there but the host was quick to get us space heaters that made it the perfect temp for us. It was perfect and affordable."

Stayed a few nights","This is a repeat Airbnb for us after a long hiatus from travel, and we highly recommend it! It's conveniently located, check in/out is easy, and the apartment is clean and stocked with lots of supplies. It's got all the charming creakiness you'd expect of a 100 year old building (sound does travel, but hopefully we didn't bother the apartment below too much), and a vintage-modern decor vibe that invites you to explore and stay a while. Clawfoot tubs may not be for everyone, but the shower configuration here works pretty well. Loved winding down the chilly evenings cozied up on the couch flipping through the various end table books and old National Geographic back issues. With this apartment as our home base for few days, it was easy to get around on foot, ferry, bus, and ride share (plus light rail in Seattle). Enjoyed dinners at Hound & Bottle and Remedy, both walkable, plus shopping and many other establishments on our list for next time. Encountered lots of nice folks in the area throughout our visit. So glad we were able to come back for a local half marathon and got to stay here again!"

Lovely walk over the bridge a block from the rental to a ridiculously tasty donut type pastry at Sabatour and then a stroll through the antique store nearby - excellent Sunday morning! Decor was vintage fun and the quaint old building this unit is in reminded us of old Seattle and places we’d lived in the 90s (just with way nicer furniture than we had back then 😁) . And the bedding was super cozy!

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was very stylishly decorated and super comfortable. It is a building with the other units, but I never heard much noise. The view is lovely!
I really only used the space for sleeping, so I can't really speak to how well equipped the kitchen is. I did spot and old loaf of bread that had fallen behind the microwave. This could've easily been missed, but with this being my first stay since covid, it did make me question the cleaning.
I tried to contact Tory once and never heard back. In his defense, it wasn't an issue with the space, I wanted to try and buy some of the coffee cups he had that were identical to some that my grandmother had. I was surprised to not hear back from him at all, especially after reading reviews about how responsive he was. Even with the minor issues, I'd stay here again. Although not a problem for me, the listing really should mention the number of stairs, as it would be an issue for older folks."

The neighborhood was really quiet, even with the windows open the whole time. During the day, the upstairs apartment stayed quite comfortable with the cross-breeze, but it did get warm at night when the breeze died down, even with the fans graciously available (to be fair, it was one of the hotter days we've had in the area, upper 80's). The apartment is in a great location to see the area and even has peek-a-boo views of the water out the front window. I would definitely recommend Tory's place for anyone wanting a relaxing place to get away."

Lots of natural light, plenty of amenities and space whether you want to stay in all day or just have a nice place to rest. It's an easy walk from the ferry terminal (we used the regular WSF ferry, Kitsap Fast Ferry and Foot Ferry to get around). We also walked around downtown and across the bridge to Manette, lots of friendly residents greeting us along the way. This was a great place to rest after a full day in Seattle and other more local adventures. Everything's there if you want to dine in or lounge in front of the TV with cozy blankets to ward off the winter chill. Sounds from neighboring apartments can be heard and it does have stairs up to the building entrance and second floor apartment, all of which was very tolerable for us. Self check-in and check-out was easy, and we messaged Tory only briefly as needed. Definitely a place I'd be happy to stay at again!"

Stayed a few nights","Tory has a very cozy and charming place, it was clean and tidy and I loved the decor! Even had some fun music playing from the stereo when we arrived. Location was nice too, quiet neighborhood and close to downtown and the ferry docks if you’re wanting to go to Seattle. Easy breezy check in process, helpful host, unique environment, I will be happy to stay again next time I am in the west side and would recommend it."

Stayed over a week",We enjoyed staying in this mid-century modern apartment. The neighborhood was relatively quiet but felt safe and many restaurants were about a 10 minute walk away. We also walked onto the ferry a few times so location was very convenient and close to the military bases. Street parking was always available for a single car and a permit was provided. Overall would recommend- there are few such nice options for this area.

Stayed one night","This place is simple yet fun, tidy and there are nice views from the living room and deck. Walking distance to town, which was really nice - great eating options as downtown grows up and seems very safe. Bring your own cone filter if you want to use your own coffee - but kitchen was functional."

Stayed with kids","Tory’s place is amazing to stay at. His place is very clean and welcoming. Great location for the ferry to Seattle (10 minute walk) and near great places to eat locally. Also, if you love burritos you must make the drive over to the Blue Agave in Port Orchard."

Stayed with kids","Lovely!
The apartment is well appointed and has a beautiful view of Minett Bridge and the water. The bed is very comfortable, almost challenging to get up!
We loved the kitchen, old fashioned but perfectly capable prep and cook space, very nice. The back porch looks over lush backyards and sitting on it was peaceful. We felt very safe and the breeze was wonderful with all of the windows open. We were so comfortable and wish we had longer to stay in Bremerton. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything I could of wanted, all in one neat apartment. The place was clean, had all the amenities listed and even some extras. Host was quick, responsive, and more than willing to make any extra needs fulfilled within reason. Location was excellent, making foot traveling a real breeze when visiting the local area. I’d definitely book this place again when in the need for both a cozy and convenient place to stay while in Bremerton."

Stayed a few nights","Very stylish space, loved the collage wall, and decorations. Great location if you are exploring smaller towns in the area, easy access to highways. Shower has amazing water pressure! Tory left the stereo tuned to a great Seattle college radio station called KEXP that I listened to a lot during my stay, found out about a lot of cool new music. Very quiet and peaceful at night. Street parking was easy. Would stay again!"

Stayed one night","Highly recommend Tory’s place. Check-in was easy, the apartment is bright and spacious and has a nice view. Location is great; centrally located. Neighborhood felt very safe. There is a fun antique/flea market a couple blocks away on Pacific. The apartment was well stocked with towels, dishes, etc. I slept on the pullout sofa bed and it was surprisingly comfortable. Very charming place. Would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Tory’s place is awesome. I had to make a short trip for work on the shipyard and it was extremely convenient to walk to work versus driving. Also, got to enjoy the night life downtown and not worry about an uber. The apartment has everything you need. There are 3 other apartments but I never heard or saw anyone so it felt though I was the only one. I will book my stay here every time I travel to Bremerton from now on. Thanks again!"

There are roughly a dozen steps up to the apartment and two locks: one door to the outside and the apartment. Host was easy to reach and responsive. Apartment was clean, and things were easy to find."
