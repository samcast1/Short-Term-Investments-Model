Stayed about a week","Martyne’s home was so lovely! The canal view with the pool was so relaxing, and the amount of natural light coming in was beautiful to start the day. The 2 rooms we used were very comfortable. Everything was immaculate, and Martyne was very welcoming and attentive."

Stayed over a week",Martyne's kitchen was incredible. We loved the open floor plan and all the amenities. You almost had to be a chef to appreciate it! The beds were comfy and the baths very modern and full of comforts! The patio was large and furniture ample. The pool was not as clean and warm as I hoped but it was refreshing. Every time we had to contact Martyne over something she got back to us in less than an hour. We would stay there again if it weren't so far from our family on Hutchison Island.

Stayed with a pet",This was exactly as listed and a great place to stay. The pool was an extra perk. It was great to have a mostly quite place to stay while visiting family in the area. The neighbors even had fireworks during the weekends. The house was very well stocked and we didn't really need to bring as much as we did. We would stay here again if it's available on our next visit.

Cesily went above and beyond to ensure that I had a great experience, providing helpful tips about the area and promptly addressing any questions or concerns I had. Overall, I highly recommend Cesily as a host. Her hospitality and attention to detail truly made my stay memorable. I would not hesitate to book with her again in the future."

Stayed with kids","I’ve stayed at many places being an Army girl of 20 years. I also stayed at 4 Airbnb’s while in Florida. By far this is the best place I’ve ever stayed, better than Marriott, better than Embassy Suites. I can’t say enough about the home design, the flow of the home, the decorations, to the snacks and water she left for our family. The pool was covered with a lanai that kept out the bugs but allowed the cool breeze to pass through. The beds were the most comfortable; they were tempur pedic mattress’s for sure. She did not just have things to take up space but quality items from the grill, to touch lighting lamps to the quality paper towels, multiple sweeteners, fresh towels and beach towels in ever room and tv’s throughout. So many personal touches that we appreciated especially the multiple soaps available and laundry detergent. The kids enjoyed the beautiful clean pool which seemed to be an amazing temperature despite not being heated. We will only stay here going forward. Thank you."

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay at our Airbnb house located at Avalon in Port Saint Lucie! It’s located on a nice quiet street. Easy location for getting to places - a bit off the main drags.
The yard was pretty private with not many neighbors around. The neighbors we met were very friendly. We enjoyed a lovely screened in porch and outdoor seating as well!
This house was so homey and had everything that we would need - including a welcoming bottle of great wine, some snacks and coffee for the coffee pot! They thought of everything for our comfort including soaps, starter paper products and toiletries! Beach towels! Games! Basic spices and salt and pepper. All necessary appliances are new and in great working order! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with our two small dogs! We have family in the area and would be happy to return! Eric was very responsive and friendly. Great stay!! We highly recommend! Note: twin beds in second room - great for kids, more than for a second couple."

Stayed with a pet","We have stayed at many Airbnbs over the years. It would be difficult to find one that was as lovely, welcoming and well appointed as Erik's place. Everything was spotlessly clean. Great beds, lush linens and towels, full compliment of amenities, cooking needs, and lots of thoughtful touches. Many wonderful extras like a welcome basket for us, and a doggie closet with anything we might have forgotten for our pet. This place is designed to feel like home away from home with a peaceful and elegant coastal vibe. We especially loved the outdoor spaces and enjoyed our morning coffee and evening wine on the porch and patio. Our fur baby loved the large yard, and the neighborhood was wonderfully quiet. The house is a quick ride to Jensen Beach and lots of great restaurants. It would be easy to spend a month or even a season here. Erik was upbeat, helpful and impressively responsive. We felt lucky to have found it and can't recommend it highly enough."

Unfortunately, during our stay, the lever in the shower broke (self-inflicted). The landlady responded quickly and fixed the damage. We were able to easily pay the cost of repairing through airbnb. For a stopover the place is really great!"

It was conveniently located to restaurants, etc. The only confusion was even thought she said the room was on the LEFT side of the house, the drive was on the right and another room there so I thought maybe it was the Left side while looking at the street instead of the left side while looking at the house and I tried to go into the wrong room. Go to the left side opposite the side with the drive. I would definitely stay with Maria again."

Private entrance, they respond instantly if you didn't understand something. They are super friendly. I was impressed with the cleaning!
The bed and pillows are comfortable, and they don't smell like a man's sweat.
If you have coves, you get the AC down, and that's very important to me!
They have snacks (protein bar, instant soup, oatmeal, and coffee)
I don't know what else to say, everything was excellent.
And a very picky traveler says it:)

You can hear a lot through it so don't plan on having too much fun during your stay ;) The location is just minutes from Walmart and Panera! Overall a good value."

The neighborhood is very active with a beautiful pool, hot tub and a fitness center, friendly people are always walking around the neighborhood or riding bikes. There are lots of things to do in the surrounding area like great restaurants, clubs, shopping etc and a short drive to the beach.

From the jet tub to the bath salts and tempur-pedic mattresses this place exudes comfort. If your husband or wife is getting on your nerves there is a whole balcony with a fan and a tv (private sanctuary). I’m currently 7 months pregnant and we had to add an extra day because of how magnificent this place was. Suzanne thought of everything she had your beach towels, bags, umbrella, games, bags for laundry, all types of cookware. It felt like home!"

I had to go buy trash bags and dishwasher pods & toilet paper bc there were only 2 of each left for a 10 day stay.

She has taken care of every single detail to make us feel like home, welcoming card, sweets, refreshments and drinks are something outstanding as well as her message’s double checking our stay and needs. Table board games and Toys for my little one inside the property was something we loved and enjoyed, the complex pool and vibe is on another level.
The property is like the pictures (much better honestly), the village condo is safe, clean, and very well located, next to tradition which has a lot of good restaurants, stores, bakeries and supermarket.
Undoubtedly, this place is a 5 star for family trips and relaxing time, we will get here for sure our next time in Port St Lucy.
Thanks for hosting us and let us have a wonderful time at your property."

The furnishing were so comfortable and clean. The beds gave a wonderful night's sleep. The towels were big and fluffy. I appreciated the totes that had the pool towels. It was so easy to grab and use. Suzanne was quick to respond to any need i had. I loved my stay so much i extended my stay. I look forward to staying here in the future.

The back yard was perfect with plenty of seating, the pool, the fire pit , just perfect. The only flaw was the check out, granted I think there was a miscommunication on the time but when we left I was approached by someone they hired who was very mean and nasty and made us very uncomfortable. I really would recommend this to everyone, looking forward to staying again with the family."

Stayed with kids",We loved this place. The kids had a blast in the pool and we could barely get them out to eat. We were out and about most of the time so when we did get back to the house it was very important for the kiddos to be in the pool as fas as possible. Home was extremely clean and provided all the necessary items for our stay. Krystal was great with any communication of expectations etc. We had zero issues with our stay so we had no need to contact but she did provide with her direct line as well for any emergencies. We are big water drinking family of 4 so having the water jug available on premise was a huge plus and much appreciated. Thank you Krystal. I would highly recommend this place and If we are ever in the area again we know where to book. Thank you again Krystal and Ramon for sharing your home with us. We had a great time.

Group trip","Crystal’s response time is immediate. She was extremely kind and helpful (she even brought extra firewood to us for the outdoor firepit). Our family loved the Pop-A-Shot arcade game in the clean garage – it is addicting! The only drawback was the noisy construction from the house being built directly behind them. The weather was perfect Friday, and we were hoping to sit by the pool. The workers were there all day as the roof was being constructed. The crew finished by 5pm, so we did use the grill and enjoy the outdoor furniture then. I would definitely rebook if visiting Port St Lucie and recommend this listing."

Stayed with a pet","Simply elegant. From the start a homie feeling. Spaces to cuddle, watch TV, or play board games available. Beautiful kitchen with quality appliances. The grill with table and chairs under an umbrella. Another area to sit and relax, have a conversation, or look at the stars. By the pool, 2 recliners for sunbathing or looking at the sky and relaxing. The garage with open space for playing, a giant Jenga, other toys, and a basketball hoop game that gave us hours of fun. To top it off there is a fire pit with lights and chairs to sit around and enjoy.  I rate this getaway five stars all around, from the service, quality, and details, to the beauty, convenience, and features. Stores are 10-15 minutes away. We loved it so much we want to make it a tradition as a family getaway. You can see Crystal's touch in every detail and in thinking of what might be needed during your stay. The inspirational messages in the background, to even having amazing hair and body products. Outstanding, Thank you"

Stayed one night","I would recommend that people read the house rules before booking this place, however note that required check-in time is 8:00 rather than 9:00 during the winter. If we had been staying for multiple nights, this would be a perfect place to stay. For our purposes, it was less than ideal because we had to leave a botanic garden early to rush across the state so our reservation wouldn’t be cancelled, and we had to forgo eating at a restaurant we had been looking forward to trying. Ultimately this was our fault, as we hadn’t read the house rules in regards to check-in time before booking. The space itself was clean and charming and quiet, and had a lovely kitchen area. Felix was friendly and kind, however it was disappointing to be required to arrive early for a walk-through for which the information could have been left in written instructions."

His property is well kept and I loved his back yard. It is well kept, clean, tidy and he has benches for his guests to sit outside and enjoy peaceful and quiet time. There is also a table and a couple of chairs right outside my private door and is perfectly place for morning coffee and refreshment in the afternoons.
The entrance is totally private and I felt very safe for the week I stayed at his place.
Thank you Felix!!!"

Stayed a few nights","First, I want to say that all the good things that others have written about Flex and the accommodations are correct. I just have some observations to add:
While the house has central air conditioning, the extension where the accommodations are are not well served by it. Flex apparently understands this and has provided a window air conditioner in the kitchen and a ceiling fan and floor fan in the bedroom. Flex asks that the air conditioner be used only when you are present. Consequently, the bedroom gets pretty warm during the day while you are out and takes around an hour to cool down, if the sun has set. Once it cooled down, it was very comfortable.
The listing says, ""No heavy cooking, only light cooking is authorized."" Believe it! Do not plan to cook in this kitchen. A rule posted on a door states, ""Refrain from frying.""
Would I stay here again? Yes I would. The above comments are minor inconveniences compared with all the good qualities of this Airbnb."

He even drove me to my next destination with stops in between. This is where you WANT to stay when you’re in Port St. Lucie. Also- for women who may have some trepidation staying in a home that is hosted by a single male.. Felix is the quintessential gentleman. Leave your worries behind: thanks again Felix for a great stay. I’ll be back when I’m visiting the town.

Stayed a few nights","Felix was very welcoming & available for conversation but if you want to be more private on your own there, you have that option. Felix keeps a super clean home. There was space in the fridge for my groceries & I was able to prepare meals. The house is in a nice neighborhood that is next to I-95 so it’s easy to travel to local attractions, the beach & plenty of shopping areas around.
There are 2 bedrooms for guests & a shared bath right outside the bedrooms’ doors. The time I spent there, I was Felix’s only guest. Felix’s bedroom suite is on the other side of the house.
I highly recommend a stay with Felix, you won’t be disappointed."

TV in the living room too high on the wall while sitting on the sofa always had to tilt head back which became uncomfortable . 2. we had four adults seating in living room only sat 3 people could use additional seating same goes for the kitchen only had 3 seats while gathered around one person had to stand and only 3 seats on the patio. Problem with master toilet tank not refilling with water consistently and the lack of water pressure right hand sink faucet. There is no doubt that if we return to the area we would most definitely want to return to this property.

Stayed with kids","The house is as described, very clean, and spacious. There is an issue with the bathtub where the water doesn’t fully transition to the shower head, and the water that continues running from the faucet causes standing water. I let the host know, and they were receptive to having it looked into. The master has a large shower so not an issue if you don’t need the hallway/shared bathroom. I was disappointed to have spent AirBnB money to avoid a hotel as we typically have bad experiences with people being loud in the halls and neighboring rooms, only to have the neighbors at the house having people outside with loud music and talking until almost 2am. Obviously not the host’s fault, but something to be aware of as a possibility. We didn’t get much sleep, unfortunately. The house itself is great, and there were plenty of beds for our group. Host is really responsive."

My stay at Ariel''s Airbnb was absolutely fantastic! The house is located in a great area,
Ariel's was an amazing host who went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay. The house was clean, cozy, and had all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. I especially loved the thoughtful decor and attention to detail that made me feel right at home.
Communication with Ariel's was smooth and easy, from the moment I booked until check-out. They were quick to respond to any questions I had and even provided some great local recommendations for places to eat and visit in the area.
I highly recommend staying at Ariel's Airbnb and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"

However, there was potential for improvement when it came to creature comforts—more furniture in bedrooms to put belongings on and in the living room, especially comfortable options in addition to the 3 seater couch and maybe some nice to have amenities like travel size shampoo/conditioner/body wash and salt & pepper. The grocery is very close by, so easily overcome. Overall, the house was very clean and modern and we had a great stay."

I was a little hesitant at first because they didn’t have any reviews yet, but we had a last minute trip to Port St. Lucie to visit family and we’re so happy we chose this place! There is a river view from every room in this house. It was updated, and everything inside seems very new. Melissa was very responsive. The backyard is incredible! We were able to fish right off the dock, and the pool feels like you’re on the river. We saw a dolphin, and there is also a hawk nest in front of the house. My only regret is that we have to leave today, and can’t stay longer! We would definitely come back to this house next time we’re in Florida!"

The guest bedroom and bathroom are on their own side of the house, so it felt very private. Plus there's now a private door direct into the bedroom. The bedroom is a good size with an adjacent, separate room with kitchenette. The window lets in lots of sunshine.
The location is great in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed walking to a park along the St. Lucie River and some good options for dinner. I was able to easily drive to other things I wanted to see like the water, nature preserves, and historic downtown Fort Pierce.
I highly recommend staying at Nelsa's!"

Stayed a few nights","After I had left my Airbnb a few miles away, I was looking for a safe and clean place. My husband found Nelsa's place and within a few hours everything was taken care of.
Once you get in their cottage, you enter their lives. Warm, cozy, hard working, sincere and very sweet people. A private bedroom and bathroom, a small fridge and if your own belongings do not fit in it, it is allowed in the large kitchen in the fridge.
The road is explained when you don't get somewhere. So just a trip to Florida was a big step out of my comfort zone for me, but here I felt safe, and everything was clean and well arranged. I would DEFINITELY recommend this Airbnb!"

This place is nice the room is cozy and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is not in the room but it's close to it, the setup is very private as you are on the opposite side of the house from the other bedrooms. The bottled water in the bedroom was a nice added touch, we had a chance to talk with Nelsa before we checked out and we were even offered fruits, muffins, cake and coffee for breakfast. She's an excellent host and I would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","The best thing I like is that it was private & gate locked on side of home to access the air bnb door. Parking was tight but I couldn’t complain as I have a spot in the driveway. Yard was well lit, especially coming home late at night. Patio area was nice but there is dirt you have to walk through before you get to concrete path. This part is between front driveway and sides gate that lead to air bnb. I didn’t hear a lot of outside noise while sleeping.
The bed was comfortable and sheets & duvet were quality. There were plenty of outlets and the small clothes organizer was a plus since there was no clothes closet. AC got nice & cold and was not too noisy.
The shower water pressure is better than most places I stayed and the water got really hot really fast. Shower drained well while showering and was not clogged. Really loves bathroom amenities including tooth picks & pre-pasted toothbrushes. Loved that there was a double sink in the bathroom.
I will definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Wonderful Airbnb! Stayed here with our 9 month old son based on how many reviews mentioned how clean the place is — absolutely true. This studio feels big due to the tall, recessed ceiling and minimal decor which we love at Airbnbs (less dust, more space for your things). Surprisingly spacious bathroom. Felt very private with separate entrance on the side of the house. We never heard any noise from the main house. Mary and Ignacio were very responsive to our messages. Will definitely consider staying here again!"

From the moment I stepped into the charming abode, I felt an immediate sense of warmth and comfort. The attention to detail in this Air B&B room is truly remarkable. The host has thought of everything to ensure a memorable stay. The decor is tasteful, blending modern elements with cozy touches that make you feel right at home. The room was immaculately clean and exuded a wonderful ambiance that immediately put me at ease. One of the standout features of this Air B&B room was its impeccable amenities. I cannot recommend this Air B&B room enough! It exceeded all my expectations, and I am already looking forward to my next visit. If you're searching for a home away from home, look no further. This Air B&B room is a hidden gem that guarantees a delightful experience."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at this AirBnB hosted by Matt and Marina. They were extremely responsive hosts and the accommodations were exactly as expected. We were in the area for a couple days just to relax and it was perfect - quiet and peaceful. The decor was perfect and the amenities in the house were wonderful. I loved the pocket doors in the bathroom -- so cute! We saw lots of children playing in the neighborhood, riding their bikes and playing basketball which reassured us that the neighborhood was very safe. I did want to mention that the mattress was really comfortable and we even messaged them after our stay as we wanted to check it out for our own home. My husband and I have been together for 40 years and have never agreed on a mattress that we both loved and we both slept so well during our stay. We will definitely return in the future."

Stayed a few nights",We really enjoyed our stay at Matt & Marina's house. Even though we used their house to stay at while we were in Port St. Lucie for a work trip; we all mentioned we wanted to come back and stay for a vacation one time. The heated pool was a great bonus and it was refreshing after a long day of work. This home was decorated so cute and each of the rooms had a little different touch making everyone feel right at home. We always received a quick response from the host and appreciate their assistance in making our stay flawless. You will not be disappointed if you stay here.

We didn't have any issues while we were there, but the few questions we had were answered very quickly. I would definitely stay here again, and will recommend it to my friends as well.
We wish we could have stayed longer instead of returning to the Michigan snow."

P.s a side note we noticed the microwave did take a while to heat up food. Example, one of the items we’ve cooked for 7 min and still was solid cold. It takes about 2-3 times to get something hot sometimes 4. Overall everything was amazing thank you again :)"

Matt and Mariana’s home is stunning and on such a great location was just perfect for us while in town looking for a new home for Nan and seeing other family.
We did have a few things which I have mentioned to Matt and Mariana as we did not have enough towels but they did sort this out for us as soon as possible.
Unfortunately there is no hair dryer in the property and I have mentioned this to them.
Other than that house is beautiful (shower in en-suite is amazing)
Thank you and we would love to come back again when visiting again next year.
Thanks

The pictures did not lie, the place spotless, comfortable and the pool is an added bonus. We felt so at home that we invited a few family members living in Port St. Lucie and who hadn't been on that side of town to spend the day with us. The neighborhood was quiet ams we felt safe. Whenever we're back in Port St. Lucie we'll definitely stay here."

Stayed with kids","This was our first Airbnb experience and we’re so grateful it was at Marina & Matt’s. We had a wonderful 2 week stay in our home state visiting with our family and enjoying the sun and swimming. Marina was quick to respond and so friendly and kind we couldn’t have asked for a better host, very deserving of the Superhost title. We would highly recommend. We were welcomed with champagne and chocolate bunny’s for our boys after a long travel day and it was such a welcoming touch, thank you.
The house was just as described and sparkling clean. It was equipped with everything we needed plus extras like toys and pool noodles and a speaker for using around the house and outside. The house was very spacious for our family of 4. Beds were super comfortable with plenty of bedding, water pressure was fantastic and the ac cool and always comfortable (as Fl natives we know sometimes Ac’s struggle on hot days but this wasn’t the case) pool was heated just right and well taken care of, my kids enjoyed it everyday and all the outside seating was great. The photos do not don’t justice, it really was resort enjoyable. Thank you for a great comfortable spring break. We hope to stay again on a future trip."
