Stayed a few nights","What a gem of a place! Michael's apartment was everything we could have hoped for during our short stay. The location is second to none, nestled in a lively neighborhood with plenty of dining options just a stone's throw away. The apartment itself boasts a modern, stylish decor that makes you feel both comfortable and a bit luxurious at the same time. The kitchen was equipped with high-end appliances, which we didn’t use much but were impressive to have on hand. Michael, the host, was outstanding - always responsive and genuinely caring about our experience. He also provided great local tips that enhanced our visit. Overall, an impeccable stay that exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a top-notch experience in the heart of the city!"

Good restaurants a block or two away. I booked during a crazy week when conferences had pushed hotels way up in price, and Michael's place was by comparison much nicer and more reasonably priced. I didn't cook but the appliances are top of line -- Viking range, etc. Very happy with my stay."

Stayed a few nights","This is a terrific stay in the vibrant Logan Circle neighborhood. The place is safe, modern, clean, comfortable and has everything you need. By day, we’d catch a short bus ride or ride share to the sites of D.C., and by night we’d walk the neighborhood and grab supper at one of the many super-close and delicious restaurants. If you like urban charm and energy, this killer pad is for you. Good communication, vibes, and all-around value. Enjoy!"

Stayed a few nights","Our host Michael is wonderful! He gave us detailed recommendations of favorite restaurants etc. Le Diplomate was a standout, Teds Bulletins breakfast and bakery (yum), and for convenience -Amazon Go grocery store was around the corner! The apartment is beautiful and comfortable! If you were to cook, you will find the best appliances to make a great meal.
We loved the bathroom tub, bidet and double sinks!
As far as parking, we had a parking pass provided by Michael which was necessary! We had to park two blocks away probably due to our late arrival time but it was not a big deal. The museums are so close we were able to walk to them. The African American History Museum is so amazing...
Thank you Michael!

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful Christmas stay at Michael's lovely unit in DC. The unit itself was perfect for the two of us. It was spotlessly clean, very well appointed with high quality appliances and furnishings, had a super comfy bed and was quiet and peaceful in the evenings. It really was all that we could have hoped for. The location was great too, with really enjoyable nearby restaurants and groceries all in easy working distance (Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Amazon Fresh). We didn't get a hire car and were quite happy walking and utilizing Ubers to get around. A special callout to the super helpful directions and recommendations that Michael provided before we arrived, they were detailed, useful and interesting (excellent restaurant recommendations too!). Overall we really enjoyed our first trip to DC and when we return we would happily book Michael's unit again when we do. Thanks Michael!"

Stayed over a week","We have stayed at Michael's before and knew what a lovely place we would be staying at. His place is exceptionally clean and well appointed, with extra conveniences that make us feel right at home. We love the kitchen as we like to balance cooking in with going out, especially during longer stays like this one. The location is wonderful. On a quiet street yet so close to shopping and wonderful restaurants. We were there for two weeks and loved that we never once had to use our car having access to a variety of different public transportation nearby. Other pluses for us were having a bathroom with 2 sinks, access to a washer/dryer, king size bed and the fireplace adds a special cozy touch. Better than a 5 star hotel!"

Michael renovated the apt (I believe) recently and has maximized the space available with attention to the small details.
FYI -
Found a parking space just outside the door. Michael sent a parking pass ahead of time.
King sized bed - try finding one in DC
Coffee and condiments supplied
Etc…
Will definitely stay here again"

The apartment is located on a quiet residential street, a short walk to bustling 14th street which has many fine restaurants. Michael provided me, in advance, with a parking pass and I easily found parking on the street. The self-check in worked perfectly.

Stayed a few nights","This place was great!! This was our first trip to the DC area and I’m so glad we ended up at Michael’s! The neighborhood is beautiful, the architecture is awesome, and there were tons of bars, restaurants, shopping etc. all within walking distance. We will for sure stay at Michael’s again, or in this neighborhood if we have a larger group. Michael’s place was super clean, stylish, comfortable, and just spot on! Parking on the street was easy early in the day, but about mid afternoon, it fills up pretty quick. We were still able to park within a block away, so it wasn’t a big issue. Michael’s check in instructions are super detailed, so everything was easy, even when we first arrived late at night. No issues whatsoever! It’s also a very safe neighborhood. We walked it late into the night. I could keep going about how great our experience was, but I’m running low on my word count. Bravo Michael! Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","I absolutely love this apartment and will definitely come back again. There are too many reasons to list all but here are a few. First, it is beautifully decorated with high end appliances and decor. The recessed lights are dimmable throughout. There are heated bathroom floors, and a reclining tub, Viking appliances, and a winer cooler refrigerator. The entrance is lovely as the picture shows. There are two doors providing security and the first door opens into a hallway where you can place your belongings safely before actually getting inside the apartment. All the instructions are complete, accurate and was probably the most well thought out Airbnb in which I have stayed. The location is ideal. Uber arrives within 5 minutes and costs about 12-15 dollars to go around DC downtown and Georgetown. Le Diplomate is a wonderful French restaurant right around the corner. We easily walked back from the Mall a couple times during our stay. We had no reason to contact Michael. All was perfect"

Stayed a few nights","Michael was such a great host. The apartment was unlike any other Airbnb location that I have ever booked or stayed. There isn’t any location like this! The bed was ridiculously comfortable (I have a cervical spine condition which has me feeling pain usually when I sleep) so this was definitely a plus! The kitchen was perfect for cooking and well stocked. I was definitely surprised once I saw that Michael had a lot of amenities (dish washing soap, sponges, etc) that a lot of (Airbnb) listing do not have. The bathroom was clean and stocked. Michael communicated with me weeks prior to arriving and made the check in process so smooth (I have never experienced the level of service Michael provided to me compared to any other location). I found parking right in front of the apartment. Michael also printed out the parking pass for me and dropped it off upon arriving. I will definitely be staying here again! Unfortunately, there is a word limit on Airbnb reviews, but so much good too say!"

Check-in was very easy - Michael was even able to accommodate letting us check-in a bit earlier. I also forgot to secure the parking pass from Michael in advance per his instructions, but very quickly he was able to print out a pass for us to park which was so helpful. All in all, I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","This was easily one of the nicest rental properties we’ve had the pleasure of staying in! Amazingly clean, well-decorated, and comfortable. Getting in is easy and parking was a non-issue. If you’re a very light sleeper you may hear footsteps or dog ‘zoomies’ (which just made us miss our pup) on occasion, but it’s rare, not late at night and didn’t wake us at all. Michael’s instruction guide and restaurant recommendations were spot on and much appreciated. The area felt safe, was very walkable with access to public transportation. Also, only an 2 or so mile walk to the museums which was a great way to see some of the city. My only regret is not having time to cook in the wonderful kitchen! Highly recommend and we hope to visit again!"

There was street parking which we were lucky enough to snag (it goes quickly especially in the evenings) making it easy to load and unload the car. The apartment was clean and pictures were accurate. Only minor complaint I had was on the last night it got a bit warm in the bedroom and I couldn’t for the life of me make the AC unit run nor the ceiling fan to be on without the light being on. Other than that it was wonderful! I’d definitely stay there again for future visits to the city!

It had great square footage and wasn't too far from the downtown museums and monuments. We liked that the bus stop was around the corner. There were things that were overlooked and didn't meet our expectations (bathroom and kitchen cleanliness, shower issues, and bath linens), which took away from what had the potential to be an amazing stay. For me, it's the attention to the small things that makes a stay positively memorable."

Just a heads up, this is a basement (lower level) apartment and because of the hard wood floors there was significant noise from the folks living upstairs. When they walked or shut doors or did anything. While we were out most of the times at night we could hear noise from the floor upstairs.
Michael was excellent and prompt with his communication. I would highly recommend the place and would rent it again. We had a very comfortable stay."

The neighborhood the apartment is located is perfect. So much fun, inviting, and convenient. So many close restaurants but we never heard anything from the apartment making it ideal of a light sleeper. We also felt very safe the entire time.
Parking was super simple and we found a spot directly in front of the apartment without evening trying. We just left our car parked the entire time as my husband and I are big walkers. We walked the entire time. It was about a 45 minute walk to all of the museums and we enjoyed every minute of it.
Having access to the washer and dryer was also an added bonus. It’s amazing to come back from a vacation without needing to do any laundry!
Michael was a wonderful host and we hope to come back one day."

Half a block from all the restaurants, pubs, groceries, coffee shops you could ever need and unique local shops. I attended a conference at Mt. Vernon Convention Centre and the location was perfect to walk back and forth from every day and get away from the noise and concrete jungle of downtown. Michael provided several restaurant recommendations that we fully enjoyed, especially La Diplomate, and provided several guidebooks to plan walks and visits. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Stayed about a week","This place is gorgeous, I mean really stunning!. Finely appointed with high end finishes and furniture. Michael is super friendly and communicates well, although I wish there had been a sheet of important facts within the apt so we didn't have to bug him. We thought parking on the street might be an issue, but it was not. Heads up on Street Cleaning day as posted and be sure to move your car. The King bed is firm but comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked with efficient appliances. Stacking washer and dryer work excellently. The shower/toilet area is cramped and the higher tub is difficult to enter and exit with no safety bar provided ( Michael says he is contacting his contractor to have a safety bar installed and change out the toilet seat.) The double sinks outside the tub area, while lovely to see are not functional. Flat iron & hairdryer want to slide down into sink as most of the counter area is taken by huge shallow sinks---another safety issue. Extraordinary neighborhood of Victorian rowhouses or walk-ups (not all brownstones) that are lovingly being restored, some with courtyards in front , charming landscaping and old brick walkways. Location is excellent as we were mainly on the National Mall at David's Tent (10 min. drive )and found yummy restaurants at Michael's kind suggestion right around the corner. Thanks again Michael and Toby!"

It was super easy and quick to catch an Uber to the museums and monuments downtown. We loved seeing the cherry blossoms and dining at Le Diplomate!
The home is thoughtfully equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay, and Michael was a very communicative host. Nothing but glowing things to say. Worth every penny!"

Joseph was super communicative from the moment we first booked. I also thought it was really kind of him to block the next day after checkout in case there were delays because of snow. We ended up having a later flight and Joseph was nice enough to give us a late check out.
The space itself was awesome! So close to a bunch of walkable places. I want to come back again since our stay was mostly to attend a wedding festivities. The space was really private and was perfect for our weekend away:
Overall great experience. Thoughtful host in a really cool neighborhood is a perfect mix. Thank you!!"

I notified him that I needed to check in early due to my flight and I was approved quickly without problem. Instructions for everything were clear and easy to follow, so my stay was smooth sailing from start to end. The place is just as shown on the photos and has everything you need for short or long trip. Highly recommended!"

He provided shampoo, conditioner, water in the fridge, washer and dryer with everything you'd need for both, a gorgeous private backyard area, movies, extra blankets, and so much more.

You’re also within a 15-20 min walk to Capitol Hill, National Library, and more. By car, it literally takes you less than 10 min to get to every major site in DC. The actual AirBnb is perfect - Joseph’s designed the place to feel like home. You’ve got everything you need, including a small kitchen, washer/dryer, a foot massage machine, and beyond! Joseph is communicative and friendly, and makes you feel at home. We loved every minute and cannot wait to come back."

I must not have read everything through all the way when I booked.. We did not realize that the owner lives above this place (which you can hardly tell anyone is up there!). There is a shared front door with a hall way. I only say this because we did not realize it the first night (blaming it on being so tired from traveling and coming in late that night) and slept with the French doors open! 🙈"

Joseph was kind and the communication was prompt and helpful. The apartment is in an adorable, quiet neighborhood about a 10-15 minute stroll to the metro. We definitely recommend treating yourself to this spot and look forward to our next stay!"

The location is perfect! We walked everywhere! To the Capital, museums even walked home from a NHL game at the arena. If walking isn’t your thing then there are scooters to hire everywhere.
If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs as you will hear footsteps above you. However it’s not bad and stops early in the night.
Edith communicated with us to let us know she was having people over so the noise might be a bit louder than normal however ensured it would be done early enough. which was nice and we had tickets to go out anyways.
Don’t pass up this gem! We will definitely stay again."

When she found out that our family had shared interested, she offered extra hospitality - and I'm sad we couldn't work out the timing, but... next time!
The property is immaculate and has everything you need for a stay in Washington. The hosts even offer two Metro cards loaded with some $$ so you can get around. We travel to the area enough that we have our own Metro cards, but no host has ever offered this during our prior stays. If it's your first time, you'll appreciate it.
The kitchen is well-stocked with coffee, tea, sugar, etc. We were attending a conference, so ate many meals there, so we didn't cook, but did find a GEM of a local Indian restaurant called Indigo. It's walking distance, family-owned, affordable, & the food is delicious.
This is a great property & we'll certainly stay here on our next visit!"

Her listing was so helpful with all the details and she was responsive to a few questions I asked prior to our arrival. So much so that we didn’t need assistance during the visit. We felt right at home and loved having a cozy place to recover each night after a long day exploring. The location is fantastic- we ate at several walkable restaurants for dinners (such a cute neighborhood) and appreciated the short walk to Union station where we caught the Metro to head to the museums. Honestly, the first trip was a bit challenging for us, but we caught on quickly and appreciated the use of the metro cards. One morning we stopped first at the Library of Congress (only because Edith recommended it on the listing). Wow- certainly worth seeing! (It required a free timed entry pass like many of the museums, but was easy to get.) We’d love to come back and see more."

Stayed a few nights","One of the best Airbnb stays I've been!
I first want to highlight how responsive and kind Edith and her husband were. My husband and I were messaging them weeks before our arrival due to our travel schedule, and they were always accomodating and understanding.
Secondly, their listing was absolutely clean and felt like staying at home. We were in DC for 5 days so it was important for us to have a cozy, comfortable place where we can get groceries (Trader Joe's is ~1 mile away). Major brownie points for having access to the laundry!
Thirdly, the location was amazing. We didn't rent a car or take public transportation (we LOVE walking). We were able to get around just by walking, which felt so great considering that where I'm from is not a walk-friendly city.
We highly recommend this place and we'd definitely come stay at Edith's again!"

Edith compiled a terrific list of things to do, restaurant recommendations, best ways to get around, etc. And she was great at anticipating our needs, like making it easy to get into the apartment the first night, knowing that we were going to be arriving late. While we didn't need to contact Edith during our stay, she provided us both her and her husband's mobile numbers should anything urgent arise. We felt very well taken care of. It's no surprise she is a superhost. Thank you, Edith."

From providing public transport cards that we could use, to a map on the wall where previous guests could put a pin to show where they are from, every detail is thought out.
Location is great, walking distance to the Metro, Capitol Hill and all the main attractions. If you can't get there walking, you can easily catch the subway. Some great food options in the area too - Ted's Bulletin for breakfast or Cafe Berlin for a German dinner. That said the kitchen is also well equipped if you'd prefer a night in.
Would not hesitate to stay here again and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone considering staying.
Thank you again Edith, and all the best.

It's a great location with a 10 minute walk to either the Capitol South or Union Station Metro stops, and several bus lines available nearby. Great set up for 2-3 people.

( our son is 4.5 years old so we couldn’t rent two wheelers; but we think D.C is a city most suitable to be explored on a two wheeler, do it if you can)
Our hostess Edith was the best hostess one could hope for: kind, responsive and knowledgeable.
We loved our stay here and would book it again without hesitation!"

It’s beautiful and quiet. There are some local pharmacies and corner stores nearby, so it’s very convenient to get some supplies. Edith is a friendly and responsive host. She provides many useful facilities such as metro cards and an umbrella in the studio. I feel warmly welcomed here. The only imperfection is that the studio is not very soundproof. You may hear people upstairs walking and talking. But that is not a big issue to me."

Stayed a few nights","This spot in DC is an absolute GEM! A 10 min walk to good food near a metro, 5 min walk to a metro that goes to Union, and the walk straight to Union is reasonable as well- I think it was a 15 min walk. I felt pretty safe, which you can’t say about many places in DC.
The bed was so comfortable and the place was clean. Check-in was easy and we were left feeling very satisfied with the spot.
A few notes but not dealbreakers:
- The water pressure was subpar. I have VERY chick hair, so I couldn’t wash my hair on the trip. Not a big deal- I even found dry shampoo in the bathroom. I noticed the water pressure issue everywhere we went, so I think it might be an issue everywhere.
- We brought most of our clothes on hangers, but felt like we had limited space to hang them.
- The freezer in the mini fridge is very small.
Nearby food: We ate at Santa Rosa Taqueria, Good Stuff, and Union Pub. All so good! Look for Happy Hour anytime you eat or drink!
We would definitely stay here again!"

Edith was very lovely to me. I found her to be helpful, responsive, and personable.
I will definitely stay here again if it's available during Rare Disease Week on Capital Hill 2024!"

We loved the ample supply of coffee (sorry Edith and Mark, we did take advantage of that - we coffe-holics LOL). The location is excellent. We came by train - it was an easy walk to their place. The location was also nice and close to the mall - we walked to the museums. Their were nice touches: the Keurig was filled with water ready to make coffee ( you can probably tell our priorities).

Edith left us lots of tips and helpful info in the welcome binder as well as a couple of metro cards which we quickly learned to use and even left a few dollars on for the next guests. We would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway close to the iconic DC landmarks. Our only cautionary reminder would be that it is a basement unit, so we were able to tell when the family was home/moving about above us but we would consider this very standard and did not mind at all. Our entire experience was pleasant, the check in & out were super easy and we would definitely stay here again."

The location is great with easy access to metro, cafes, restaurants, biking or walking trails, all within safe neighborhoods. The entire home is neat, perfectly equipped with lots of personal touches. We enjoyed our stay and will happily do it again."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at the cottage for four days on a work trip (my org is based in DC, and I work remotely in another state). The space was exactly as described—cozy, comfortable, and spotlessly clean. At the end of long days of meetings, coming home to the rainfall shower head and the big bed was lovely. The location is perfect to explore Adams Morgan/north Kalorama—very walkable and close to excellent restaurants, but removed enough to feel away from the crowds. At night, traffic to/from the Ellington Bridge can be heard—that’s the only negative I encountered here, and it didn’t bother me overall. Andrea and Margaret were very responsive and clearly take pride in their space. I look forward to returning!"

Not only was it tastefully decorated (okay, this is one of the cutest places I've seen) it was set up with all essentials for travelers. LOCATION! Nestled in the cutest, most walkable area (Adams Morgan) I was able to get around on foot easily. There is so much to check out literally just down the street locally or a quick 10-20min walk down the way. If you are looking to make great memories and take phenomenal pictures, this is certainly the place/area for you. Everything is so picturesque even in the rain. It was always nice to come back to such a clean and cozy place after a long day of exploring. I can't rave about the place enough. This is my top place to book for my next visit - hands down!"

The accommodation, whilst compact has been thoughtfully created. Only a few minutes walk from multiple restaurants, cafes and supermarkets too. The finishing touches are excellent; everything described in the advert but also some wonderful surprises such as the comprehensive device charging dock and the two drawers full of coffee and tea pods to name but two. The hosts are particularly responsive and we can’t recommend this property highly enough if you’re ever in need of a spot close to DC centre. We would love to come back!"

With severe storms and 80 mph winds in the area, they alerted us when an alarm suggested possible flooding in the space. When we confirmed, they immediately took care of us with a last minute relocation. BEFORE that, we found the space to be great, with personal touches. (And so appreciate umbrellas, since we forgot ours). The neighborhood is fantastic, and there is so much to do for eating, people watching, shopping or getting into the downtown DC area."

Even in a hot July the apartment felt cool and when it was warm the AC was quiet and effective. Communication from the host was first rate throughout and they even offered earlier check in without us requesting it which is a good indicator of how thoughtful they were. We would rebook without a second thought if we return to DC.

The hosts were responsive and immensely helpful. My husband and I stayed for 6 nights and would stay again in a heartbeat. The Cottage is a short walk to the Metro and a shorter walk to the Circulator bus system. There were many great restaurants in both directions and a Safeway just a short walk away. We give Andrea & Margret and the Calvert Cottage our highest recommendation! Thank you for your hospitality and kindness!!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed here for two nights with our 13 yr-old grandson, for his birthday. Andrea & Margaret's place was clean, spacious for the 3 of us, and looked like the pictures. Lots of thoughtful touches throughout the apartment, including a birthday surprise for our grandson. Andrea & Margaret let us drop off our luggage before check-in, and also gave us early access to the space, which was a big help on a cold grey day. Communication from booking to check-out was strong. The bed was comfortable, and the grandson did fine on the couch. Public transit, groceries, as well as many restaurants and shops are all short walks. Whenever we needed a Lyft/Uber, it never took more than a few minutes. We hope to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a gem.
First the location is incredible. The house is located in a serene and picturesque neighborhood. Only a few blocks from the house you will find abundance of nice restaurants and cafes, grocery stores and little shops. You will also find attractions within walking distance such as Rock Creek Park, National Zoo, Embassy Row, and Dupont Circle to name a few. If you need to travel further there are several bike stations nearby.
The room is very specious and lovely. It looked even nicer than pictured. It is thoughtfully decorated and fully stocked with everything you will need to feel at home.
Last but not least, the hosts are wonderful. From the thoughtful way the room is designed and the communications I had with them, I could tell the hosts genuinely care about their guests and would do everything to make sure their guests enjoy their stay.
If your are brining your car I suggest you look into public parking because street parking will be almost impossible. I brought my car and left it in a parking deck for the duration of my stay.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and can't recommend it enough!"

Stayed a few nights","Had an absolutely wonderful stay at Andrea & Margaret's cottage and it will be the first place I look to stay anytime I visit DC in the future!
My partner and I arrived here at the end of a long 3 week trip and it couldn't have been a more relaxing and pleasant place to stay. Comfortable bed and couch, wonderfully decorated, coffee, washer and dryer, and any and all extras you could think of (we loved the popcorn!)
Despite technically being a studio, the unit is quite large and was more than enough space for the two of us.
The location was great; we intended to spend a lot of time in Georgetown, which was easily accessible by Uber and bike. We also biked to the National Mall and Smithsonian museums without a problem. The Adams Morgan neighborhood felt safe and lively, and was picturesque given the seasonal fall weather.
Communication was great and Andrea & Margaret were exceptional hosts. We really hope to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve ever had. The space itself was clean and spacious for a basement apartment and is exactly as the listing shows. The bed was very comfortable and we had plenty of pillows and blankets to choose from. The kitchen is well stocked, the TV has a ton of channels, they provided coffee and tea for the Keurig, and the rainfall showerhead was a nice way to relax at the end of a day of walking. Andrea and Margaret have obviously worked very hard to make sure their guests have a great stay - they went way beyond providing the basics and it’s the small touches that turn a good stay into a great stay. They provided umbrellas, a yoga mat, toiletries if you forgot anything at home (like my toothbrush), filtered water in the fridge, and basic pantry staples.
The location cannot be beat and I thought the price was a great value. Check-in was a breeze and they were great about communicating before, during, and after our stay. Adams Morgan is a great neighborhood with so many restaurants and bars within walking distance of the apartment. The metro stop is about a 10 minute walk or Uber was always available within a few minutes."

Ann is a terrific host and shares all sorts of helpful information"

All communication with Ann was pleasant and smooth at all times - not only that but she kindly sorted out a last minute parking permit and on a rainy day prompted us to the umbrellas available in the house! The house was perfect for what we needed and located perfectly for us. We will recommend this if we come back in the future!

I wasn't fully sure when I'd arrive because of the conference but Ann was easy to communicate with and gave great instructions for how to access her place. It had everything I needed for a couple of days in DC and was close enough to walk (or catch public transit not far away) to area places. I'd definitely book here again when I'm in town next!

Stayed about a week","Location and value were high, especially compared to pricer options nearby. We loved the area! it was easy to walk to local restaurants, Trader Joe's, and connect to the metro train or bus service. Being an old building, there were some quirky things like the lights flashed sometimes. Heat is hard to regulate in old buildings so we appreciated the space heater as it could get chilly in the living room/kitchen space. The TV wasn't super great so we ended up watching streaming services on our own devices. We liked the kitchen space as it had everything we needed for our week-long stay. Again, the value was worth it for the amenities and location!"

Stayed a few nights","Ann is very friendly, nice, and super responsive. The location is perfect. Close to the metro, with great restaurants and shopping a block away, and the neighborhood is really cute. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. The kitchen and bathroom surfaces were very clean.
The unit is affordable and geared towards work trips. The bed is pushed against two closet doors that have the water heater and furnace inside, it can be a little noisy. A major concern I had was that the unit did not have any smoke detectors (they were removed by the owner) and no C02 detector in the unit, which did not make me feel safe considering the utilities are directly next to the bed. There also was not a deadbolt in the back door leading to the owner's basement and exit (only a doorknob lock). In general, the unit felt a little unmaintained (lots of dust, rusty and dirty vents, and generally a little beaten up), but that might be fine for budget travelers!"

Space was very comfortable and had all amenities we need. Bed was very comfortable and worked for us. The radiator is in the closet next to the bed so if you are sensitive to noise when it turns on, keep that in mind.
Smaller space perfect for a couple. There is an air mattress available for another guest so good in a pinch, but works perfectly as a little couples retreat.

The neighborhood is also wonderful very walkable and quiet but also close enough to a group of bars and restaurants that you still have stuff to do. The public transportation access is also great its about a 10-minute walk to the U Street Metro station and about the same amount of time time to a bus stop I didn't drive at all when I was there and loved every minute of it. The place was tidy and comfortable with a cute little bench out front that is great for morning coffee.

Boiler in the bedroom closet, a foot away from the bed, constant noise from the neighbors upstairs. Very cold and no thermostat in the apartment. I didn't feel welcome or appreciated as a guest. The host complained that I put the dishes in the wrong cupboard and accused me of bringing extra people. Whatever happened to airbnb spirit of hospitality? I have stayed in over 100 airbnbs, but couldn't wait to get out of this one."

I could hear their shower running, dogs claws on the floors, the television, people talking, all above the bedroom as early as 5 AM. I tried to sleep in the front room to avoid the noise but Noise was everywhere. I’m a super host and always check in with my guests to make sure all is good. I never heard from my hostess during my short stay. I wanted to LEAVE earlier. Mind the heavy clamps holding the headboard together. Don’t hurt yourself. This is a place to store your luggage only not for resting after a long day of sightseeing. I could only sleep on the metro and missed my stop. No brochures about how to get around town, the metro, or sights to see. Responses from hostess were short, curt, and as little as two words. I bumped into the husband outside and first words out of his mouth he asked me if I had been vaccinated. - instead of asking me how my stay was going. I hope I never have this experience again at a BNB ."

Stayed a few nights","We were very satisfied with the apartment. It is a spacious basement with a separate bedroom with a lovely bed, a living room, kitchen and bathroom (shower, sink and toilet). The apartment has all the comforts and has good wifi. You have access to the garden. It is located in a nice neighborhood and close by is a supermarket and a cozy nightlife street. The residents have provided a folder with good tips about restaurants and other information you may need. Also they have provided cards with balance for public transportation. That's very nice because then you can travel right away and you don't have to arrange that yourself first. With several bus lines, you can travel to the sights. It is also very nice that we were allowed to leave our luggage a little longer because we didn't leave until later in the day. We would like to stay here again next time and highly recommend this apartment. Best wishes to Jen and John."

Great recommendations for museums, and she and her husband were just warm and friendly. Couldn't have asked for better hosts. The location is in the heart of Adam Morgan and we went to some great restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance that really made it easy to relax after a full day of Museums. Uber to the Smithsonian's and monuments was $10-$15 but the location is also 3 minutes from a $2 bus ride that takes you to the capital. The hosts provide you with smart trip cards that can be used on the metro or bus just refill back to $20 at the end. It's a little thoughtful gestures like these I really made the stay relaxing. Thanks for hosting a great location."

Their place had all we were looking for in an airbnb. It is also located in a very convenient spot for seeing the sights of downtown Washington DC. They also provided good information on how to get around the city and provided metro passes for renters to use. There were also snacks provided and coffee with cream. The only downside to the place is that the kitchen is a bit cramped for counter space to prepare food, but that was also clearly stated in the listing. It would not change if we were happy there, it is merely inconvenient. We also requested and were granted a late check out which helped make our last day there easier. We would definitely stay here when we return to DC."

Jen was super accommodating, and took extra steps to ensure that my elder family member would be able to access and utilize the space easily, which we really appreciated. She stocked the apartment with excellent coffee and a variety snacks, and communication was great throughout the whole process. We felt very taken care of. Thank you, Jen!!"

Stayed about a week","What a great place to stay in DC!
Location: It is a close walk to the Adams Morgan neighborhood, which is a fun place to go to bars and for shopping. From here, you also have easy access to the bus or Metro. Jennifer is kind enough to provide Metro cards for you to use during your stay and reload before you leave. Those were very handy!
Apartment: It's a quaint and cozy little 1-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen which worked well for us to make breakfast every morning before we went sightseeing. It also has a nice living room and a patio for relaxing after a day of sightseeing. The wi-fi and the AC worked very well.
The owners: They lived in the house above the apartment. We talked with them the first day we arrived and they were very nice. We were on our honeymoon and they were nice enough to leave us a gift of Prosecco to toast on our first night in DC. They offered us good advice on how to get started on our vacation. They were also very respectful of our privacy during our stay.
Affordability: The apartment was very affordable compared to others I looked at.
We would definitely recommend this to any couple wanting to visit DC!"

It is small, especially the kitchen and the shower, but not to the point where we could complain. The kitchen had everything we needed. It is a bit of a walk to the nearest metro but we like to walk and found that enjoyable and safe. There is a large grocery store is a block away. Everything else that we needed was very near on 18th Street or Columbia Road. Great restaurants and bars in the area. Jen's communication was always quick and helpful. There's some good info on DC and the neighborhood in the apartment too. The Metro cards were a nice added touch. We definitely would stay here again and hope to when next in DC."

Bathroom was nice, provided shampoo & soap etc. TV worked great. Bed was comfortable. Only qualification is that it's a basement unit, so some spots where structural beams are I had to duck to walk under (I'm 6'3). But it's not like I was ducking the whole time, only in a couple spots, and if you weren't my height wouldn't be an issue. They were also nice enough to offer to store my luggage for free in their home before check-in and after check-out. Had little snacks available when I arrived. Overall great stay."

Stayed with kids","The place is GREAT! I think it’s actually a bit bigger in person than in the pics! Every essential tool you would need is in the kitchen, washer/dryer, separate bedroom (my son opted to sleep on the pull out couch in the living room). It’s quiet and just SO charming! The bed was also REALLY comfortable. My son and I walked and biked a lot. This place is only 1.4 miles from the National Mall, but everyone in the city seems to rent bikes, electric bikes and electric scooters. They are pretty cheap and you can be downtown at the tourist attractions and restaurants in 10 min! Beats using Uber/Lyft. You also don’t want to lose your parking spot near the place once you find one, which we found to be easy at 4 pm. You can literally pick up a bike or scooter anywhere in eyesight in the city and take it anywhere else for a very cheap price! We did bike down one night (because it was mostly downhill) for dinner and took a Lyft back because we were full and it was dark. 😂 we did a LOT right around the apartment though! TONS of eateries are within 4-7 min walking distance! We needed a CVS for something, I wanted to get some groceries to make breakfast…… it’s all SO close! There’s a Trader Joe’s and Target close to there as well, but we didn’t go. The hosts do provide a visitor parking pass for street parking and metro cards if you need them. They also don’t charge a cleaning fee, so I cleaned up a little extra before leaving! If I EVER stay in DC again, this will be the place! WONDERFUL hosts!!!"

My 2 elementary school aged children and I had a wonderful stay! The apartment is cozy, convenient, stylish, and clean as well as being convenient to the zoo, groceries, and public transit. Jen and John are great hosts. They're easy to communicate with and very responsive.
We mostly did the Smithsonian & National Mall tourism, but we spent a decent amount of time in the neighborhood as well. Adams Morgan is alive with international food and boutiques, buskers, bookstores, and record shops. And the apartment is tucked back a couple of blocks from the heart of the action so it remains quiet and feels safe and residential at the same time."

The permit parking the host provided was very convenient as well. The apartment was also spacious, perfect for couples. The room was very big and kitchen was super cute!!
We drove here so everything was pretty quick to get to. I wouldn't say DC is walkable but with the electric bikes/scooters everything is about 10min from this Airbnb! close to grocery stores (like 4 min walk ). It's the perfect place to stay to hit the capitol building, Smithsonian museums and staton park (which I heard is beautiful for the cherry blossoms)."

Stayed a few nights","Graham is probably the most responsive and proactive host I’ve experienced with Airbnb! He provided detailed information before we even arrived so there were no questions about where to park and how to get in. Plus he gave us GREAT restaurant recommendations that ended up being delicious. The place is walkable to the National Mall, but there are also bus stops directly in front of the apartment and Union station was an easy walk. There was a sports bar called The Big Board underneath the airbnb that didn’t get too loud, but was amazing when we wanted some late night bites or a night cap, and was awesome to something have that close after a day of driving when we first got in. The owners there were also super nice and recognized us the 2nd time we came by. I loved the street we were on. The homes had super pretty architecture and there were so many shops, restaurants, and fitness studios nearby. We LOVED the outdoor patio on the roof. Grab a bottle of wine & enjoy the view like we did!"

Stayed a few nights","I liked the location at Graham's place a lot.
Once I learned the best route to Capitol Hill, it was less than a 10 minute walk. Union Station is very convenient as well and the Red to Yellow lines were a quick, easy, and cheap way to Reagan National. It took me 1/2 hour total from when I left the house to landing at the airport (of course some of that was due to luck and timing). I'd give 45 minutes for an early morning commute to DCA.
The unit does face two busy streets and it was a bit noisy until 11:00 midweek but it settled down after that. I typically am not very sensitive to noise I can do nothing about.
Graham's place was comfortable and clean and a real plus to have a washer, dryer, and dishwasher in the unit.
The TV worked. Although when presented with two remotes I usually pick up the wrong one and start punching buttons and it takes awhile to get myself out of a TV pickle. It didn't take long and all my favorite channels were there.
I would definitely stay there again."

The apartment was in a fantastic location, within walking distance to The Mall and all the museums and monuments as well as Union Station. The neighborhood had tons restaurants and markets with a real neighborhood feeling. It felt safe and quiet, yet still close to the action.
Graham & Bear were incredibly friendly and helpful. They were always available to answer questions and offer recommendations, making us feel right at home.
The studio itself was small but perfectly appointed with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. It was clean, well-maintained, and had a warm and inviting atmosphere. The Rooftop deck was a nice treat and I'm sure even better when the weather is more cooperative.
When we are back in the D.C. area we will stay no where else."

Stayed one night","It was an easy stay from beginning to end. I did not have a chance to stay long enough to take advantage of everything Graham had set up. It's a spacious, private apartment, perfect if you're there for pleasure or business ... just stay longer than I did. Graham's been hosting for a while, but this location is new. He did a great job getting it ready for his first guest (me,) and I really can't find anything to nit-pick about. I'll definetly keep it in mind for next time ... unless someone beats me to it. Thanks for everything, Graham."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay. Very clean, linens were top notch, this was one of our favorite Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at. Everything was thought of…from snacks, laundry detergent, baggies, extra toiletries, full kitchen, everything was upgraded like a 5 star hotel. We asked for fans for white noise and he provided 2 sleeping machines along with a purifier for noise.
It’s a very walkable area, I never felt unsafe. There are grocery stores and many restaurants that are walkable. I cannot comment about buses/Metro as we walked everywhere or used Uber/Lyft/Empower. If I had to give feedback on something it would be that the internet was pretty slow and there was no full length mirror.
We will definitely stay here again when we return."

Stayed a few nights",We were lucky enough to stay in Jason’s lodging in D.C. recently. We highly recommend this Airbnb as a Gold Standard location. Jason was a perfect host. The bed was comfortable and each room beautifully decorated with top-quality comfort in mind. There were so many amenities that made our stay especially pleasant. The kitchen had excellent tools for cooking. The neighborhood was beautiful and full of picturesque well-loved homes! The unit is a couple of short blocks from a bustling street full of great restaurants and shops with creative products. If Jason’s apartment is available look no further…. Book it!

Stayed a few nights","Jason’s rental was honestly the best airbnb we have ever stayed at. Checking in was straightforward as well as communicating with Jason. It was super easy to find in a great area. They had extra towels and additional pillows, which were really great. I’d highly recommend selecting this for your state in DC. It’s a great part of town with really good restaurants and easily walkable to the sites. Will be staying here when we come back to DC"

Stayed a few nights",Jason was simply the best and the space was amazing! About a 10 min walk through a peaceful neighborhood to the Green line and a bunch of restaurants around the block. If you haven't - eat at Le Diplomate!! Everything within the building was clean and the space was so adorable. Jason had a list of recommendations and also snacks waiting for us upon arrival. I LOVED the shower. I could go on and on about this place and will probably seek this rental out for our trip in May!

Stayed a few nights","We’ve stayed at dozens of Airbnb rentals, and this was clearly one of the very best. Jason is an excellent host and easy to communicate with/responsive. The apartment was pristine/spotless, with nice design details; it was also probably the best supplied rental we’ve experienced. The neighborhood is great - a quiet street of row homes, but just 1/2 block from 14th Street restaurants and shops and 10-20 minute walk to several metro stops. Overall easily 5-stars; don’t hesitate to book!"

So close to all DC has to offer, from great dining to the national monuments. This place made a great home base to come back to. Jason had everything to coffee and tea and even snacks. Super clean and updated location. Loved it"

Stayed with kids","We had the best time at Jason’s home! Not only was he a super helpful, friendly, responsive host (he lives just upstairs), but the home is GORGEOUS. It doesn’t feel at all like a lower level space - there’s lots of light (and privacy at the same time). He has thought of everything you might need and included really thoughtful touches - especially in the kitchen but everywhere else too! We loved cooking in the full-size, brand new kitchen with amazing finishes but also loved that we could deliver anything we wanted (it was snowy and cold and we have a small baby) and get it delivered in no time OR walk to dozens + restaurants! We hope to stay again and cannot recommend Jason and his home more enthusiastically!"

It's newly renovated, well furnished, and very thoughtfully appointed (it is well stocked with small things that make life easier). I had everything I needed and then some. It's also situated on a street that is accessible to a million great restaurants, shops, and public transit. Even though it is a busy part of town, the apartment feels private and is quiet. The host was very responsive, and it's clear that they have put a lot of thought into making the space welcoming and comfortable for guests. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Probably one of the nicest Airbnb's I have ever stayed in!!!!! It was so easy to self check-in, very easy to find, private. BEAUTIFUL updated kitchen, gorgeous and convenient neighbourhood (so many bars, restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores within 10 minutes, conference center within 20 minutes walk). Walkable to some of DC's biggest attractions as well! Everything down to the shower head and water pressure was amazing. I cannot recommend it enough!!!
Jason was always so responsive and helpful. I was visiting DC for a conference, and his place made for a very relaxing place to unwind after a busy day, I felt right at home."

Stayed a few nights","We can’t recommend this place enough. The host has thought of everything. We arrived late after a long day of travel and were pleasantly surprised that there were a number of snacks for us to fill our bellies before bed. The entire place was spotless and welcoming and made us feel right at home. The king size bed was very comfortable and made for great sleeping. The shower has excellent water pressure the bathroom is well stocked with all the amenities a traveler would need.
We woke to find a Keurig with plenty of coffee and tea options. There are also a number of sauces and seasonings and a beautiful new cooking range for anyone looking to do their own cooking.
The location was excellent with lots of public transportation and food options within a few minute walk.
Jason was easy to get ahold of and quick to respond. Don’t give it a second thought, book while it’s available as this gem will book up quickly!"
