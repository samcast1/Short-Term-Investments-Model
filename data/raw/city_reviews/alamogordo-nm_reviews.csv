Stayed one night",Arin was a super accommodating host and her home was adorable! A perfect night’s stay for a quick trip to Alamogordo! Comfortable bed and spotless home! And the bistro lights on the patio made it very easy to find at night! We will definitely stay here again if ever in the area! ♥️

Stayed one night","Aron’s place was SO cute! 10/10 recommend a stay here. Inside was just darling, decor made it feel very homey, down to the details (shampoo in shower, variety of teas/coffee, sugar for coffee/tea, etc.). Bed was SO comfy! Big tv in the bedroom and another in the living area. Arin even had the ac and fans in upon our arrival so it would be a good temp. Definitely recommend a stay here!"

Local author-vocalist Eve West Bessier and musician Pat Markham gave excellent performances. Also enjoyed White Sands National Park and Otero Artspace and the Desert Park walking trail. Arin's place is a short stroll from Lowe's Grocery with convenient premade meals. Thank you Arin for an excellent stay."

Stayed with kids","Arin’s place in NM was very beautiful and comfortable for our family of three. The King sized bed was big enough for all of us. Our son loved the games and if we had more time we would have taken the “sand” saucers out for a spin on the dunes. The place doesn’t look like much from the outside, but then we walked we were greeted with a well designed and welcoming space with real plants. We hope to get back there and spend more time exploring the area and relaxing at “the junkyard.” Thank you for being such a gracious host."

Stayed one night","Arin's place is an oasis in the desert. Very cute accommodation with all the necessary amenities, squeaky clean and aesthetically pleasing environment. The decor was hipster, perfect and minimalistic, for a moment I felt I am in Palm Springs, CA and not in Alamogordo, NM. The location is perfect if you plan to be there for White Sands National Park, just 15-20mins drive.
Arin is a rockstar and has been an amazing host. She is friendly, responsive and super accommodating. We had a request to Arin during our check out and she understood the constraints and accommodated our request immediately. Felt like we are staying at a friends place who is always there for you to guide you and help you in navigating a new place you are visiting for the first time. 100% recommended place for couples and small group of friends.
If Arin's place is available for your dates, dont think just book it.
Lastly thank you Arin for being such a humble and friendly host."

Stayed a few nights","My parents and I stayed here for two nights as a respite from our recent camping lifestyle. It is a beautifully decorated house. The pull out bed was moderately comfortable, but it is in the same room as the kitchen, and hard to block out all the light when sleeping. I wish there would have been a washer and dryer. There is no oven or stove, but we were able to cook burgers and stir fry on the griddle provided. It is a great location for visiting White Sands National Park (about 20min away) and there were even sleds and wax in the house for sand sledding on the dunes!"

Stayed one night","Really great place. Super cute, super clean, and so many great touches like enough mirrors, labeled light switches, a water dispenser, great lighting and games to play. Things you don’t think of until you need them, but they had it all. Even sleds for the dunes! I wish we had been able to stop in first so we could have used them, but we were coming from the other direction. My only concern was the bedroom door going outside didn’t have a deadbolt. But the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet so I wasn’t too worried. Also note, the AC unit was kind of noisy at night so we turned it off, but that was fine because we were able to have the ceiling fan on and the temperature was perfect. I’d definitely stay again if we were in the area."

The mini splits for the two separate areas allowed us to sleep cool but walk into a comfortable kitchen in the morning, which is always a great way to start the day. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom provided plenty of light for my wife to get ready, and the place was far enough from the main road to avoid noise, but close enough that we were able to get where we needed to go easily. I would definitely recommend this to any couples I know heading to the area."

We got to Alamogordo early in the morning, and she allowed us to use her dune sleds well ahead of check-in time, kindly leaving them on the porch for us as we passed through town. When we got back, we were delighted to find that lights on, A/C cooling, and a fridge filled with general condiments. We appreciate the thought and care that went into decorating her home, and wow...that bed...we got lost in it, it was so huge. Overall, a great stay, and most importantly, only minutes from Los Vicor's #9 Mexican Food California Style which we're still dreaming about. We will have fond memories of Alamogordo and certainly recommend this AirBnB to our friends!"

Stayed a few nights","Kourtnie is a fine host and I had no personal issues with her, however I just want it to be known that her place is a bit misleading. There’s a back door that’s vaguely included in the photos that leads to a fenced in backyard that includes a shed with a front door, curtains, and blinds which made us super uneasy. There is also a door in the main bedroom (immediately in front of the bed) that is not shown in the photos that has a metal wire door that directly leads to the carport. Also what was strange is that the bedrooms had no TVs, just empty mounts. My boyfriend and I arrived at the Airbnb when it was already dark outside and the place had an eerie feeling and made us unsettled so we left and checked into a hotel that was nicer and the same cost. We reached out to Airbnb, and Kourtnie did not allow a refund, but luckily Airbnb gave us some money back. Would not recommend this place. Just saying all of this because I wish I read a review that included all of this."

Stayed with kids","The house was cute, but the use and smell of Fabreeze deodorizers in the living room, kitchen, and all of the bedrooms was overwhelming. We have family members with allergies and asthma, and the use of chemicals made everyone cough and wheeze. Even after opening the door and windows, the smell was overwhelming. All of the linens and bedding, our clothes, and everything reeked of Fabreeze. So I would recommend considering your guests with allergies. Even the airlines ask that their passengers refrain from using perfume in consideration of other passengers that have allergies to chemicals."

The place is actually bigger than what it looks like in photos! The interior is beautifully decorated and the kitchen is stocked with everything you could possibly need and the beds were comfortable. Check-in was super easy with keyless entry. Kourtnie was quick to respond to a question I had. Pro-tip: don't go looking for a black trashcan in the alley after the sunsets. Even if you trip the motion sensor lights the trashcan still blends in with the shadows! Overall, a fantastic experience and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Alamogordo area!"

Overall, her home was cozy, clean, and made us feel right at home. She has a knack for putting the finishing touches on a space and making it feel as comfortable as possible. It was one of my favorite Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at!"

Traveling with adult children and sometimes grandchildren, we found Air BnB to be an economical and preferable alternative to two or more hotel rooms, allowing us common space to meet and ability to make our own food. Although this house is small, for the three of us, it fit the bill perfectly."

The landlord gave us all the information you will ever need and more. When we arrived there were a bag of fresh bagels for us, snacks and a handwritten welcome card.
Me and my girlfriend stayed 2 nights here and had an awesome time. Quiet neighborhood and nothing to complain about.
If you stay here on 4th of July the parade starts just down the block from the house wich is very convinient.
I highly recommend staying here if Alamogordo is youre destination!"

Everything was really thought out for guests. We were visiting White Sands (only 20 minute drive) and the water bottles and snacks Kourtnie left for us were such an awesome touch. Truly can't recommend her AirBnB enough. She even has this nice binder full of activity and restaurant recommendations and it was so useful! We went to Nuckleweed Place for breakfast and it was amazing. Be sure to call for reservation and bring cash/check. Kourtnie's AirBNB made our stay in NM awesome."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at Valerie's. You can tell she put a lot of effort into making it a comfortable place to stay. It was the little details, the first aid kit in the bathroom, the stocked kitchen with pots, pans, and spices, and of course the TVs in all the rooms!
She was always very responsive to all our requests. We look forward to staying again."

Easily accessible and host was accommodating with an early check in so we could get ready for a wedding rehearsal. Beautiful home matched the pictures you see! Even my husband said “you picked a good one honey” because we have had some not so good ones! Well worth the trip to stay here!

Stayed a few nights","Overall, the place was very well-maintained, clean, and the host responsive. Some kitchen items were missing for washing dishes, and the host ensured that was taken care of immediately. We did feel a little bit uneasy initially at the neighbors house, which is very rundown and shoddy, but overall felt safe in the neighborhood, and it was quiet. We would have no reservation staying at this place again, and found it to be a good value with good hosts."

Group trip","The place was great. We were there only for one night because of a special strawberry moon event at White Sands but it was exactly what we needed. Also one night bookings are hard to come by so we jumped at the opportunity to stay here. Very clean, lots of space, and the 85” TV in the living room was a nice bonus. Only downside is, now I have to buy an 85” TV for my house."

We are from the East Coast and had stayed in a remote Abiquiu airbnb for a month, with dwarf trees and shrubs. This property was indeed a desert oasis. We loved the theming, colors, faux grass, trees, and of course the pool and hot tub. It is a destination onto itself, reminiscent of SoCal or Florida (without the humidity). Perfectly clean, comfortable master bed and huge bathroom. It was so rejuvinating and relaxing that we would have stayed for another week if it were avaliable, even though we still were renting the other house! One of the unexpected highlights of our Southwest adventures!"

Stayed a few nights","Angela’s home was clean & welcoming. The area was quiet. The home was very spacious. The pool is what sold us. We spent some time in it everyday. The backyard is beautiful. The hot tub was a nice addition, although we did not use it during our stay ( too warm). This was by far one of the cleanest Airbnb’s we have stayed at. Angela was very responsive to the few questions I had. If ever back in Alamogordo we will be back. Home is not far from white sands or Holloman AFB. Sleds were available for white sands if needed.
10/10 recommend. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

From the moment we walked in, it was home away from home. Immaculate home, amazing pool and backyard, spacious, and perfect for family bonding time! We never even ate out once for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We’d go out for the days activities, and all of us just couldn’t wait to get home and cook and eat as a family. I couldn’t have asked for a better location to enjoy having time with my kids!!
Angela was extremely helpful and attentive to our questions or needs! I can’t wait to book with her again!"

The house was comfortable and well-appointed, with an exquisite household that felt like a luxurious oasis in the middle of the alluring arid landscape. The spacious backyard was a highlight, with brilliant mountain views that left us in awe every morning and evening.
Throughout our stay, the owner was incredibly responsive and attentive to our needs, ensuring that we had everything we needed to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We were positively impressed by their commitment to providing exceptional hospitality.
Overall, I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone seeking a serene and rejuvenating getaway. Whether you're looking for a peaceful retreat or an enthralling adventure in the desert, this property is sure to exceed your expectations."

Stayed over a week","We enjoyed our stay. We had a beautiful view of the mountains. The home was large, clean, great neighborhood and in a good proximity for restaurants, grocery stores and things to do.
We just have a few constructive suggestions that could have helped make our stay a little better: More portable chairs available for sitting at the kitchen table. The place can sleep 8 but there are not enough chairs for eating at the table. We purchased 2 folding chairs to accommodate our guests while we were there. Also, more silverware would have been nice. We were constantly having to wash them because we would run out.
Also, it would have been nice to have a table and chairs to sit at outside on a nice sunny day. The view was so nice and it was very private so we would have liked to have spent more time out there.
Overall, our stay was great and the house was very nice. We give it a good rating, especially if the above suggestions are taken into consideration."

Group trip","The best BnB while staying in Alamogordo !
My family and I grew up in New Mexico and always make a point to meet up for vacation in Alamogordo every couple years or so. This was our first time staying at Angela’s place and is now our favorite !
The home was huge and the kitchen was spacious and well equipped. Having a pool, arcade, and baby items was such a treat ! The living area and beds were comfortable and the best part was the views from the yard! The location is quiet and close to everything in town. It’s also a quick drive to White Sands and if you’re coming from El Paso or Las Cruces the home is right when you come into town which was nice .
HIGHLY recommend to anyone needing to stay in Alamogordo!"

A place I dubbed ""DesertBeachOasis"" the 4 bedroom home is loaded with amenities to make your stay extra special. See the local sights around the area. the guest book will give you most of the information you'll need to help plan your stay. After a day of being out and about come jump into the pool for a refresher! there are plenty of towels so don't forget to grab one on your way to the pool. There is a coffee station and the pantry has a few things for the Kuerig coffee maker. Stop at the store on your way in to pick up and extras you may need. Las Cruses and ElPaso are aprox 1 to 1/2 hours driving distance. The home is very comfortable and you will definitely enjoy your stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","Four of us traveled to Alamogordo with the main purpose of sprucing-up the graves of my wife's parents. This home is in a newer neighborhood of the city surrounded by well-kept homes. We were somewhat concerned with the proximity to Scenic drive, but happily there was little if any traffic noise in the evening when we were trying to sleep. The hosts have a nice welcome booklet with things to do, restaurants, and maps of the city on a small table. There were several sledding discs in the garage for you to use if you plan to go to White Sands National Park, recommended if you have never been there. The master bedroom is nicely separated from the other two, and the home has an ample kitchen and eating area with dishes, silverware and cookware. Two TV's with lots of program choices. The front porch is a great place to sit and enjoy an adult beverage with a view of the mountains to the East. With any luck, the back porch will treat you to one or more spectacular New Mexico sunsets!"

Stayed with kids","We appreciated the opportunity to stay at this rental. We encountered a few issues during our stay and the property manager responded to our texts timely; however the issues we encountered impacted the quality of our stay and also gave the impression that the home may not be regularly inspected and/or that too much reliance is placed on guests to notifying the property manager of issues.
PROS:
- Home was well cleaned in majority of areas. Refrigerator, bathtub, kitchen and bath counter tops, kitchen sink were spotless.
- Decor was welcoming and bright
- Dishes and silverware available for each guest
- Quality towels
- Quality linens
- Location was fantastic
- Covered patio area outside was great for daytime play
- Spacious backyard area
- Affordable rate
- WiFi provided
- Clean and uncluttered garage available for guest use
- Quiet residential area
- We did not use the TV, so cannot fully comment, but TV was a nice size
- AC cooled exceptionally well
- Dryer and stovetop worked well
CONS:
- All four interior garage lights were out when we arrived making it difficult to bring in luggage through the garage (arrived at night / dark). New bulbs installed the next day once we notified the property manager.
- None of the outside patio lights or fan worked (porch light or overhead lights or overhead fan). There was a strand of plug in lights that light up dimly through half of the strand the strand but did not provide enough light to use the patio at night. Maintenance looked at this when replacing the garage bulbs but was unable to fix as it appeared to be an electrical issue.
- Walkthrough door from garage to outside patio was hard to physically open, even by an adult, due to the door / latch alignment being out of whack.
- Kitchen/dining seating consisted of 4 heavy chairs and 2 barstools. The barstools were incredibly wobbly and we’re not safe for use so our family ate at the table in shifts.
- Washing machine leaked all over the garage when used. Only one towel is provided for each guest making washing a necessity if you stay several days. Thankfully this was the one load we washed before experiencing the leak.
- Microwave stopped working and a burning wire smell was present in the kitchen. The breaker did not trip, but when we reset it, the microwave came back on, indicating an electrical issue rather than a microwave issue.
- The metal frame of the front door threshold was broken, exposing sharp edges.
- Trees were overgrown, completely blocking the front walkway between the driveway and the front door. Guests had to walk through the rock zeroscape to get to the door.
- Circle cinderbricks in the middle of the front yard created a tripping hazard, as no trees were planted in the circle, essentially leaving a hole in the yard. Cinderbricks in the back yard were broken and strewn around the yard.
- Baseboards and edges of floors in bathrooms were not clean. In addition, the main bath had a green drip stain all along the top edge of the wall.
- Kitchen does not have GFCI outlets"

Group trip","We enjoyed our stay in Alamogordo. The house is conveniently located near grocery stores, restaurants and shopping. Not too far from Lincoln National Forest, White Sands National Park and the Mescalero Reservation. It was a quaint Pueblo style home with a covered back patio. We stayed in the middle of summer, but I'm sure it could be nice in the cooler weather!"

The neighboorhood was nice, and the garage was even better. And don't forget being able to cook steaks on the grill on the patio!
We will definitely look up Emmanuel the next time we come back."

While the amenities in the kitchen (such as pots, pans, sharp knives, gourmet stove and a basic variety of herbs, spices, and oils) are more than adequate; if you enjoy cooking with a plethora of spices, there is a Walmart Supercenter very close by where you can find nearly everything you might need. We greatly appreciated the very comfortable beds, the large capacity washer and dryer, Debra’s recommendations for activities and restaurants in town. We tried Si Senors New Mexican Restaurant and found it delicious and delightful! Debra is a very conscientious host ensuring her guests are completely comfortable and satisfied with their stay. She checked in when we were on our way and she checked in with us on our final day. It was one of the best AirBnB stays we’ve had! We highly recommend the Kerry Place!"

Stayed with a pet","Debra was very responsive in her communications. She allowed us to check in early and check out late. We look forward to staying here again when visiting Alamogordo, NM. The house is very spacious and open-concept. The oven and Microwave are very modern and work excellent. Do yourself a favor and book it, you won't be sorry."

Stayed a few nights","The home was nice and well taken care of. Roomy, soft and plush beds. Great lighting, nice fixtures, updated kitchen appliances. Pretty much all you needed was provided (utensils, cookware, seasonings etc.). My only set back was the air system in the home. We stayed in July (the hottest month to visit NM) and we would set the air to one number and then it would jump up (ex. We would set to 70 and then an hour later it would be set to 78 or 81). We knew no one in the house was moving it because we’d all be complaining about how hot it was inside. I assumed after speaking with the host (about the temp inside the home) that she maybe was able to control the device remotely. That was not confirmed…just my opinion. So we did that dance the entire stay…we’d turn it down only to be turned up. My whole family got into the habit of checking the thermostat every time we passed it by to see if it had been changed. It became a running joke throughout our stay.😂 Otherwise the stay was fine."

Debra was sweet.
Downside: not enough towels and washcloths. Asked for more and got some but not enough. No washer and dryer to wash my own.
Iron but no ironing board."

The house was clean and comfortable and had a big backyard area for our dog to run around. Debra was very helpful in the booking phase as we had to change our dates of when we visited Alamogordo, offering this stay that met our similar price and location goals from what we originally booked with her. Each step of the way she was flexible and responsive and even had great local restaurant recommendations which we appreciated!"

Stayed with a pet","A sisters and mom trip to Arizona, with a stop in Alamogordo to visit the White Sands National Park. Debra was very responsive! Debra's place was a perfect combination of clean, comfortable and cozy! There was plenty of room for all three of us to relax, hang out and catch up. The house is very cute and beautifully decorated. The only ""minor"" things were a couple of holes in back of the couch, the rug under the coffee table was stained & the backyard needed a good mow (maybe time of year); everything else was in pristine condition - again, minor. The neighborhood was safe and close to great places to eat. It is also the perfect place to stay if visiting the White Sands National Park, Debra even has sleds that you can use for the dunes. I recommend Lescombes Winery and Bistro; fabulous food & drink, super staff, within walking distance & has a pet-friendly patio. Lastly, we enjoyed lunch at Y'all's Steakhouse; the staff was great and the food delicious! Would love to stay again"

Lescombes, which we all enjoyed, and Starbucks/Dunkin’. It was close to White Sands and Debra even let us borrow her sleds and return them after checkout.

Group trip","This house ticks all the boxes for a quick family trip to see White Sands National Park or the Space Museum. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we encountered no problems. There are 4 sleds that you can borrow to use at White Sands which will save you money! The house is also pet friendly with a fenced backyard. The house was very clean and the host was responsive.
We traveled with 5 adults and a small dog to have Thanksgiving with our daughter and son-in-law and their baby and stayed 4 nights, so we put the house to the test. For a short stay where you are gone for activities, I would give it a 10 out of 10--for a longer stay where you want to hang out and visit with people it falls to a 7 of 10. The sparse furnishings and hard floors make it clean but left some of us without a place to sit down in the living room. Could have used another nightstand and chair in bedroom as well. We had an issue with the refrigerator not being cold enough, but otherwise kitchen worked well."

The owner went out of her way to make sure we had what we needed, and we appreciated it very much!"

Stayed with a pet","Kristy's home was incredible!
First of all, as we were driving into the neighborhood we couldn't help but admire how clean, quiet, and beautiful it was!! As a plant lover i especially enjoyed driving down the street and seeing so many unique plants in this area including a whole SAGUARO in someone's front yard?!? just beautiful, i was speechless.
Then, arriving to the home was a breeze. It was easy to find, the key was exactly where she said it would be. Entering the home it was very obvious how much pride Kristy takes in hosting because the place was SPOTLESS. She also had everything we could possibly need so we didn't even go out to a restaurant, we stayed and grilled at her home. Everything is provided from blankets, to dishes, to cookware to towels... just anything you could possibly need to use was there. And her back yard is ssooo cozy, we had dinner outside and our pups enjoyed running around on the grass too! Would DEFINITELY go back!"

Stayed with kids","We were in Alamogordo for my oldest daughter’s wedding. The other guests included my parents, my youngest daughter and her two children (1 and 5). We had a weird experience happen with a family member of Kristys within the first few hours of our arrival, which I will not address here. It definitely lead to my wife and daughter not feeling safe for the first few days. The only other issue I have that was very challenging was the beds. It was impossible to move on the bed without making a lot of noise. It didn’t sound like springs, but was very loud and made maintaining sleep almost impossible. I wouldn’t choose to stay there again, but I do think Kristy has a good home, home location and responds very promptly to any questions or concerns."

Stayed with a pet","Just 2 of us so we closed off 3BRs and a bath.
Directions: Watch the Cherry Hill descriptor. There is a loop/court/drive IIRC.
Large BR w/split full bath & large walk-in closet. Double sinks. Big soft bath towels, plenty of hand towels. I did not see washclothes.
Lived in home so it feels comfortable. Big screen TV, 2 cushy couches, no recliner. Hard surface floors w/rugs.
Well stocked kitchen and open to DR and Living area. Easy temp control.
Lots of parking. Big back yard w/patio and furniture.
Very nice to have laundry available.
There is more to see/do in Alamogordo than we 1st realized. Air/Space Museum, Tularosa Basin Museum, Shroud of Turin exhibit, Sunspot Solar Observatory, Armed Forces Museum, plus the White Sands area. The 3 Rivers Petroglyph Park was also close by and tons of petroglyphs. We found this location central to all that we wanted to do.
The host was readily available via text on the few occasions when we needed to make contact."

Stayed over a week","My wife and I were in the house for one month during a rather cold period weather wise for Alamogordo. We lived in Alamogordo years ago and still had family and friends in the area that came for visits and dining. The house was VERY roomy for 2 but in a good location and within a very quiet neighborhood with shopping and dining options a short drive away.. The space for our dog was great, a walking area was nearby and we had all we needed in the way of cooking and paper supplies. The washer and dryer were handy for our longer stay. The master shower drained slowly. We found ROKU TV to be very limiting especially when seeking local news as well as when trying to watch the super bowl football game. When questions were asked of the property manager, we got a quick response."

Stayed with kids","Our group of 7 had a great stay at Kristy's house in Alamogordo. Kristy is a very responsive and welcoming host and her house is comfortable and clean. There is a nice, grassy backyard, and there was plenty of space in the house for our group to relax. It was perfectly located for our trip to White Sands National Park and it was great that she has sleds and wax we could use during our time there. One note -- Kristy does live in the house when guests are not there, but the house is very welcoming and I felt completely at ease there. That said, one member of our group had a hard time getting past that and letting himself feel at home for the first day or so. Know your group and keep that in mind when booking. Otherwise, I would recommend Kristy's house without hesitation."

We booked it last minute and the place was ready pretty much right away. The host was very communicative and nice! The beds were super comfy! Don’t hesitate to book it!

Stayed one night","We only stayed one night at Debra's but enjoyed the house very much. The proximity to white Sands was crucial for us. The house is super clean and very well equipped, we didn't lack anything. It is especially nice that basic amenities are available - from toilet paper to shampoo to spices and dishwasher tablets, everything is there! That's what makes traveling super pleasant.
Debra is perfect - she responds immediately and is always willing to give tips. Absolutely recommend!!"

Stayed with kids","The homeowner clearly has an eye for design. The home is beautifully decorated. The furnishings are charming and the color scheme is perfect for a desert home. I am only giving 3 stars because the older AC system doesn’t cool the house very well and is also really loud. My family struggled to sleep due to the noise and the temperature. We stayed one night in the spring and were able to make do but I think it would be a lot harder during the hotter summer months or for a longer stay. The house and host are otherwise fine but for us, the AC was an issue."

Everything was so well equipped, including very thoughtful details, and quality, attractive items in kitchen and bathroom that many Air BnBs don't have. I would have been happy to stay there longer! Debra was super responsive and helpful, with very clear instructions. She was nice to let us borrow sleds for White Sands. The location was nice & quiet, easy parking, great for going to White Sands National Park. Only issue was that the complex was easy to miss, and the address confounded my GPS. It took us a couple of U turns to get to it. But it is a nice quiet complex off a major road, and was really quite convenient. Such a beautiful house in a relatively non-descript area, with easy access to a spectacular national park. We are SO happy with our stay there!"

You had everything you needed to cook, everything you needed to shower, the couch and beds were SO comfortable, and the decor was beautiful. It was such an amazing stay and it was a the perfect place for me to propose to my partner, which I mentioned in the guest book and Debra congratulated us. I highly recommend staying here!!"

Stayed a few nights","A lot of Airbnbs try to be cute or stylish but it's all show and not for actual use. Not so the Margarita House! This is not only super cute but also super functional. Probably the best stocked kitchen (with things and size you actually need) we've ever had! We spent 3 nights on our cross country road trip from San Francisco to DC on our motorcycle. Communication with Debra was excellent, she very kindly let us park our motorcycle in the garage since it was small enough to fit and she even turned the porch lights on because we arrived after dark. We loved everything about the Margarita House! So much space, comfortable beds, great kitchen, great shower heads, comfy couch to hang out. Due to the heat and our exhaustion we spent quite some time in the house and we were super comfortable. We did not want to leave! We would absolutely stay here again and we can only hope the airbnb at our next stop will be half as nice as this one!"

Stayed one night","This little gem should qualify for an Airbnb Plus designation.
Everything about it was over the top perfect!
Immaculately clean, very comfortable, super stylish, well thought out, awesome floor plan, quiet neighborhood, cozy beds, excellent quality and attention to details.
Plus, the location was quiet and close to everything. Stunning Mountain View, perfect for star/moon gazing. Debra has put so much effort into making this place near-perfect.
Given the aesthetics of the property, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" immediately came to mind~!
Shout out to the housekeeping staff, I don't think I have been in an airbnb that was this squeaky clean.
Would stay here again and again.
Thanks, Brenda, for your creative vision. I hope to stay here again!"

The space is beautiful and clean and has everything you need. We stopped to spend some time at the White Sands on the way to see family and Debra was so kind and let us borrow sleds and was just super kind and accommodating. The location is an easy drive to all the destinations in the area, highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Margarita House was wonderful! The house was charming and had a peaceful vibe. It was clean and we slept very well on the comfortable mattresses. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, watching a movie, and taking in the serene view of the mountains from the backyard. It was well located near town and only 18 minutes from White Sands National Park. (Which we were easily able to hit up 3 times!)
We were only 2 guests and felt the dinnerware to be a little sparse. For bigger groups this might present more of a challenge.
Debra was a wonderful host! She is very responsive, had great recommendations for us, and is accommodating. When I reached out to her about my problems with synthetic fragrance, she communicated with housekeeping and had them adjust the products they used for cleaning and laundering. (The home has residual fragrances that have been used in the past, but I was so grateful for her willingness to assist me as best as she could.) We would return for sure!"

Sparking clean, every amenity you could ask for, extremely kind and responsive host, and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. more comfortable than my own bed. The decor was absolutely precious on top of everything else.
very easy to find, in a quiet neighborhood, mountain views from the front door. about 15-20 mins away from White sands national park, and just a short drive to restaurants, coffee, groceries, gas, etc.
Debra was so kind, helpful, and responsive. she included very clear instructions for check in and out, as well as local recommendations.
i will absolutely be coming back, but only if this Airbnb is available. thank you !!"

While in Alamogordo you have to visit the Lowe’s Super Market. They have a great coffee shop and a wine and beer bar. They make there own flour and corn tortillas, that where delicious.
