Stayed about a week","I recently stayed at Mike's place during a work trip, and it truly exceeded my expectations. The location was incredibly convenient for me and was a short drive away from all the restaurants and shops in town. The house was clean and well-stocked with everything I needed for a comfortable stay, making it much more enjoyable than had I been at a hotel. Mike and his wife were exceptional hosts, regularly checking in to ensure everything was going well. If you need a home away from home while staying in Pella, I highly recommend the Little House on Prairie Street."

Stayed one night","Mary is so sweet and so accommodating! Just my husband and myself were staying, but had eleven family members who needed a place to hang out for the evening. She had no problem with us all being there, eating our carry-out dinner, and relaxing for a few hours. We all appreciated her generosity. For breakfast, my husband and I enjoyed the strudel she had supplied. The history of the house and photos of the restoration were enjoyed by our family, as well as the two of us. My hubby said we should book her place again. Thank you, Mary, for helping our weekend of graduations and visiting friends and family so enjoyable."

Fresh baked goods were left by Mary from a local bakery. A very breathtaking home. I spent the first 20 minutes of my arrival walking around admiring everything. Mary- you should be so very proud of that home. Absolutely incredible."

I loved cooking in the cozy kitchen using the beautiful new stove, curling up in one of the throw blankets, and a bubble bath in the clawfoot tub. My daughter, a Central College student, loved the little respite from her dorm room for her bday. Oh, and just WAIT until you walk in the door and see beautifully displayed treats awaiting your arrival! It feels SO SPECIAL! Thanks much for everything, Mary!"

Stayed a few nights","The Strawtown Cottage was an absolute dream! I arrived after a long day of driving, the home was lit inside and outside, with so many charming details and surprises, I immediately felt welcome and relaxed. The details and effort Mary has put into this historical gem is impossible to put into words! Mary was easily reachable when I reached out to her, and I was happy to have the pleasure to meet her in person. I enjoyed cooking on the dream stove and slept very soundly on the very comfortable mattress. Off street private parking was an added bonus for me! The town of Pella had something to offer for everyone! I highly recommend a stay at Mary's Strawtown Cottage!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough great things about the strawtown cottage!! The place is even better than the pictures and it's like spending the night back in time. Each bedroom was super spacious with it's own bathroom. The recliners in the living room were nice and cozy and the beds were great. The local baked goods and bottle of wine speak to the history of the dutch settlers and their unwavering values towards how they welcome and treat guests. The backyard is beautiful. There's gorgeous landscaping, a patio, fire pit, fountain, vintage wagon and even a vintage car. I even had the pleasure of meeting Mary upon my check in and she gave me the history of the house and how it got to be what it is today.
This place is truly what I would consider an Airbnb gem and anyone looking to stay in the area shouldn't pass this up!!!"

Every piece of furniture and every part of the decor seems to tell a story. One can feel the history of the place. Every detail has been thought of to make it convenient for the guest. Mary was great at communicating and a gracious host. The only thing I would say to guests is that the cottage is on a main street and one can hear cars go by overnight. It wasn’t a big deal to us, but to someone who is sensitive about that kind of stuff, maybe bring some earplugs. But overall, excellent place and we would definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","Choosing Mary's place was a splurge for my sister and I who were in town to attend my mother's memorial service and visit with family. We both agreed that staying in this wonderfully tended cottage made all the difference in an emotionally challenging weekend.
We loved that everything was immaculate, no dirt or messes anywhere. We were able to invite family over to dinner one night because the dining room and many dishes were available for cooking up and serving a good meal. We felt like we were in ""our"" home for the weekend. Beds and living room were so very comfortable. The old phonograph works and had my sister and I laughing and dancing.
I hope that someday we can return, especially in the warmer months to enjoy that large backyard.
Parking was off street and very easy. My sister who has issues with her knees was appreciative that Mary had well salted and lit the path from parking to the house. Wonderful holiday decorations around yard and house were an extra plus."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great visit to Pella as well as a good time at the Strawtown Cottage. It felt relaxing to stay at this well done ‘Turn of the century’ house. The décor reflected the period of the home. The cottage provided all the amenities expected and a few surprises like an assortment of fresh Dutch pastries. Equally impressive we’re the outdoor spaces where an afternoon refreshment on the brick patio was something to look forward to after a day of fun. It was a good experience. The only negative was the excessive roadhouse due to the close proximity to a very busy highway. The road noise served as a 5:30 wake-up call each morning. So, earplugs would be our recommendation for future guests."

There was not a single thing about which we said, “ I wish this or that was here.” The outside areas, including the well-manicured gardens, are inviting. The inside is cozy and comfortable. And the location is great … a short three or four block walk to the shopping and restaurants on the town square. We made the walk a number of times over the three days. Probably our top BnB experience ever, including a top-flight host who made herself available throughout our stay."

Mary definitely has the gift of hospitality."

The home is well cared for, and it shows. We played games at the dining table and were able to walk into town with it being so close. Felt safe too. Having a full kitchen was nice though we didn’t stay long enough to use it. Felt we had plenty of space and Mary was extra accommodating with check-in and making sure we were comfortable. This is a true “gem” in Pella!"

The pictures are accurate, it's a very spacious and clean space. As stated by the host, there are stairs leading to the entrance door. It's a pretty easy climb (it's stairs, not Everest) and the stair case is new, very sturdy and spacious enough for a human and her luggage. I travel alone a lot and felt very comfortable and safe in this space. The living area is large as is the kitchen island. Very nice and well maintained home. Thank you Chad!!"

We were entertained by a deer that emerged from the cornfield while we had our morning coffee. Nearby Oskaloosa is a nice city where you can get groceries or supplies. Meredith provided an easy no-contact check-in and out. We look forward to coming back in the future!"

Stayed a few nights",The Barnswallow cottage was perfect and exactly what we were expecting! It was so peaceful and secluded. We enjoyed nature around us and didn’t want to leave. The flower farm was beautiful and I can’t wait to go back and cut my own flowers next time. Meredith had everything that one could have asked for in staying in a place away from home…Coffee and coffee creamer although I don’t drink coffee I know that is the first thing coffee drinkers look for. The bathrooms were well stocked with all needs so I didn’t need to worry about running to a store for soap or shampoo. The furniture was so cool and I loved that she had the history behind it in the welcome book. The fresh flowers were beautiful and she had them in multiple places throughout the home! I can’t say enough wonderful things about this place and we met Meredith at the flower farm and she was so sweet and knowledgeable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to definitely come back to Barnswallow!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Barnswallow Cottage was wonderful. We, 3 self acclaimed ""city dwellers"", loved the farm cottage and the farm. One drawback was the gravel road, but that is part of the farm appeal. It was very quiet, very comfortable, cozy and yet plenty of space. We really enjoyed the kitchen with the dine-in table and that the cabinets were clearly labeled as to their contents. Being a farm, you are out a ways from conveniences, but again, part of the farm appeal. The cottage was clean and appealing. We would stay there again if we find ourselves in the area again. Our visit to Pella was awesome and highly recommended and we also spent lots of time in Knoxville at the raceway!"

The outdoors had great views, fresh air and beautiful flowers.
Indoors was a tastefully re-done and decorated farmhouse. The house had plenty of gathering space but also plenty of room for each of us to have our own personal space.
We will cherish our memories of this stay and look forward to visiting again!"

Meredith is a very accommodating, informative and just all around nice. Take her up on a tour of her family’s farm...... it’s beautiful! We spent one afternoon on the Oskaloosa’s town square , which was a great relaxing day , but the cherry on top was sitting on the deck of Meredith’s place and feeling the breeze , listening to the birds and just taking the time to just be ! This was our first trip to Barneswallow Cottage and it will not be our last."

Stayed a few nights","The Barnswallow Cottage is a wonderful countryside retreat. We needed a place for friends and family to gather and feel at home. It was perfect! The cottage feels like the 1950's but is thoughtfully appointed with some of today's creature comforts; nice linens (and an abundant supply), comfortable beds, fully updated bathroom on the main floor, and a kitchen that's got all the basics covered. The area is super quite and peaceful. And unlike what you would expect from an old farmhouse, it's very well insulated and all the windows are new. It happened to be pretty windy during our stay and we never noticed the wind until we walked outside. Great place and Meredith is a fantastic host. It's clear that she has put a lot of tlc into the cottage and that she truly cares about the customer experience. Highly recommend!!!"

I was able to sit under a big cottonwood tree and read, watch birds play in the grass. It was so relaxing and wonderful. It gave me a refreshing outlook on life, after just one weekend. My friends and I played games and relaxed. Go, stay, its a nice break from the pandemic world. And safe as long as you don't spend too much time in town. We only went for supplies, but very few people were wearing masks. But that is no fault of our hosts."

Group trip","You never know what to expect when you book a place online. True to her word - Meredith's place was great! We - a party of 9 - were perfectly happy in the house. The two rooms upstairs were great - beds, lights, closets and drawers were perfect. My brother in law and his wife stayed downstairs with the boys. The one upstairs bathroom was the preferred, but I think the more the boys got used to it, they loved the basement bathroom and its roominess. We fed my son and his football roommates one night, and we found room to accommodate all. The boys we brought had soooo much fun playing whiffle ball in the open grass area, running around in the corn and just taking a ""hike"" down the road. We just enjoyed the quiet (us ladies) . It's a perfect quiet get away!"

Keomah State Park is only a short drive away, and it's the perfect spot for a walk around the lake.

We really appreciated the Welcome Book Christian and Melissa created. It is so informative on all things “Osky”: history, things to do, places to go — and handwritten comments highlighting their favorites in all of these areas! I’ve stayed at many properties in the past, and none have had such a comprehensive list of what to do and enjoy while visiting.
We HIGHLY recommend staying here and intend to share this Iowa gem with our friends!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first ABNB experience and we were so glad we stayed here while visiting family in central Iowa over Christmas. Everything was as described and the place was spotless and adorable. The photos online look great and the place is even more charming in person. Plenty of space for two adults and two late-teenage kids. Far superior experience to the alternative of renting two rooms in a name-brand hotel. Having the queen blow-up mattress available was a nice add-on as it was easy to stow out of the way during the daytime but provided extra sleeping capacity. Lots of storage and closet areas and a great kitchen/dining area. Extras like HULU and Netflix were nice to have to watch family movies on a cold Iowa winter day. Very quiet neighborhood, away from any highway noise. We can highly recommend if you’re staying near Oskaloosa. You’ll love it here."

Stayed about a week","The house is small but really cute & quite functional for 3 adults for a weekend. It was perfect for me for a week as I much prefer having access to a full kitchen (the washer & dryer were an added bonus) over an extended stay hotel.
Note that the bathroom is off the kitchen - which might be an issue if you are sharing the house with people who are shy about their bowel & bladder habits or if you are there with people you don’t know really well.
The neighborhood is quiet but very convenient to everything in town & the surrounding area. Very walkable area &, as a single female traveler, I felt perfectly safe staying here alone."

The hosts went above and beyond to make this a special experience- great music playing, the AC on, snacks and everything you need. The place is absolutely spotless which is reassuring during covid. Beautifully appointed with modern finishes. A great backyard to relax in after a long day.

I cannot say enough good things about this space. It's bright and lovely and not a bit of it is wasted; it's a wonderful blend of style and function. We would not hesitate to stay again.
Due to the fact we only stayed one night, we did not use many of the amenities, but I can say that the bathtub was nice and deep and allowed for a good soak, and the washer/dryer were a welcome luxury (especially for this couple that decided to up and go without packing anything to wear). The area guide provided was comprehensive, and due to our hosts' recommendation we had the most delicious dinner at the Wood Iron Grille. We look forward to our next visit to Oskaloosa!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay here. Samantha is the perfect host. She knew that we were arriving after dark, so she made sure that the unit was well lit. The abode was beyond spacious! And it included a bath, kitchen, and laundry room. The bath was luxurious, complete with soaps, shampoos, hair dryer. The kitchen had all of the condiments you could need. And the laundry had both a washer and dryer. Plus, there were extra blankets, sheets, and pillows. The only 2 things that I would recommend adding would be a full length mirror and a dish washer. (Although we had no need for a dish washer during our stay.)
Thank you Samantha!"

One aspect that truly stood out was Elizabeth's exceptional communication and service throughout our stay. She was prompt in responding to our queries and ensured that we had everything we needed. Her attention to detail and dedication to ensuring our satisfaction made our stay all the more enjoyable.

We did not have grands with us, but the play room made us wish we did! It was adorable. Kitchen was well stocked with everything one might need; including various sundries, like paper, pens, clips, and scissors. It was amazing! This home was remodeled in such a tasteful and attractive manner, we felt totally 'at home'. It was 3 minutes from the downtown of Pella which was alive with the Christmas Market and an abundance of boutiques. A quick, but lovely visit to Pella. Thank you host, Elizabeth. You are the best.

All five bedrooms exceeded expectations. Each room has a TV as well as separate climate controls so all family members could sleep at their preferred temperatures. The mattress and linens were top quality. Each room was stocked with additional pillows and blankets. Bathrooms had more towels we could even use! As well as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash and lotion. The entire house is the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at.
The playroom kept all three of our toddlers happy and there is a pack and play/high chair on site. Kitchen is also fully stocked with everything you need to cook (oil, spices, etc). There is also a washer and dryer. When we asked if there was detergent and they were out, Elizabeth had some delivered"

There was a thorough first aid kit (I cut my finger and was so grateful!), the quality of dishes and pots/pans made it feel luxurious. Soaking in the huge claw foot tub was an extra perk! She even thought of to-go paper coffee cups so a person leaving out could stay caffeinated! She did an impeccable job of stocking and decorating the home. One extra nice touch - each room could be climate controlled by its occupants. This makes a world of difference for people who haggle over the thermostat! Would love to come back"

Parking was easy, the town square is a short walk away, and having the special bakery next door was a treat. There is a walk up a flight of stairs to get to the apartment which could be an issue for some. The apartment is spacious, nicely decorated, and it was very clean and comfortable, with plenty of seating. The kitchen had nice appliances and other kitchen amenities that we used to prepare our breakfast and dinner. The beds are comfortable in both rooms. There are two bathrooms, but they are small and could be tight quarters for some people. Overall, it was a great experience, and we would definitely stay here again."

for us in the flat. The only thing we asked for was a kettle, and a brand new one arrived the next day. Nancy and Todd were very friendly and helpful with local recommendations. Parking outside was easy, always a space. We were visiting our son at William Penn University, the location of the flat was ideal straight up one long road.
We have no issue whatsoever to stay there again when we visit Oskaloosa.

He even offered to assist with transportation. The air bnb was lovely exactly as described and felt like home. Todd showed he really cared about my circumstances and I’ve never had that from a host.

One family member complained about not having a tv in every room but we were hardly there anyway. I love the updated remodeling of the home and once again property was very nice and my mom is 70 plus years old and she admired all of the older furniture. If you want a quiet, clean and up to date space for the weekend this is the place. Also, it’s a Walmart probably 6 minutes away and further down the street it’s a few restaurants such as kfc, subway etc. my nephew will being going to college soon and I hope this place is available when we come back for the next graduation!

Beds were super comfortable, lots of additional blankets and plenty of great towels. The kids loved the swing and the quick access to the river. The neighbors were friendly, too! Overall, a really chill, comfy stay!"

Stayed with a pet",Tiffany's home was beautiful! It was everything you would want from a cabin on the river. It was rustic and plenty of space for the 9 of us and 2 dogs that went. Tiffany is a very responsive host and went above and beyond for us. She asked what time we were getting there and left the lights on since it would be late. The house was also warm for us already when we got there. The bathroom is very spacious. The shower worked great but is a high step if you're traveling with older guests - this wasn't something we took into consideration when booking. The check-in was very simple. We would love to be able to stay here again in the summer sometime. Thank you for allowing our family to stay here on our Thanksgiving trip to Iowa!!

Easy access to all of the dining, coffee shops, and stores in Osky, as well as quick and easy access to parks and the bike trail. My only critique would be that the photos don't do the actual size of the rental justice, as the living spaces and rooms were much larger than they appeared to be in the photos. Plenty of space to stretch out, store items, and feel comfortable."

Chris, our host, was easy to contact which made checking in easy. The unit is the one and only unit on the 3rd floor of the building so it's private and quiet. Our stay was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to check out the area."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, we walked to a local diner for breakfast one morning and another for dinner. It was a quiet stay with occasional traffic noise. We never heard the neighbors that live on the second floor. The furniture is comfortable, and the apartment is very clean. It is a great value for the amenities.
This is not a contact-less check in process. We had to contact the owner for keys. We prefer a lockbox or key-pad entry, having to contact the owner is just one more thing to have to worry about when you travel.
The layout was a bit odd. The bathroom is on the opposite end of the apartment from the bedroom, the bedroom has no closet, there is only one nightstand, and if you drink coffee by the pot bring your own coffee maker, there is only a Keurig. A large, lit up fire EXIT sign is above a door directly across from the bedroom and casts light everywhere at night. Parking is annoying, there is parking close by but you MUST pay attention to the signs. During our stay we had to flip flop sides of the street.
Has some quirks but still better than a hotel stay. We would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable place with everything you need for a stay of any length. Downtown but quiet, not a lot of traffic on this particular side street. Parking was never an issue (just make sure you pay attention to the street sweeper schedule signs). Most importantly, the bed is comfortable and there’s an elevator for those that don’t pack light! Chris is a great host, available as needed. Will definitely stay again."

We were dropping our child off to college at William Penn and it was close to that as well. Hope to utilize this place for when we come down to visit in the future.

Stayed a few nights","Chris was so nice and really helped me get settled in and was attentive to my needs… when an air conditioner went down he made sure to get it worked on right away and checked in to make sure it was cooling down, also checked in to make sure I moved my car to prevent any parking trouble due to a car show that was happening over the weekend. He was also flexible when I needed to extend a day. The air bnb itself is really really nice and well planned out, the appliances, tech, furnishings and everything are really updated and Chris has thought of every little thing… extra towels, blankets, awesome chefs knives in the kitchen, TV guides and lists of best local eats( Smokey Row coffee is awesome and connected to a really nice little bookstore, rock island tap has delish bloody marys!), a really comfy bed, lots of natural light, and the location was awesome. I walked to a day’s worth of small town attractions with no problems. This Airbnb blows any hotel room out of the water for probably 40$ less a night. If you have to stay anywhere near Osky, this is the place to stay! Don’t hesitate!"

The host was beyond accommodating, professional and friendly. With everything from a complete kitchen (to include dishes/pots & pans) washer/dryer, two tv's, cable and internet provided, it was a much better option than the motel room we've always used in the past. Thank you Chris and Airbnb!!!!!"
