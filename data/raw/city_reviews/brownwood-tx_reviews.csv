The place was extremely clean and well stocked with every amenity that one might need. It was well decorated, great taste! The bed was extremely comfortable, even down to the comforter.

Stayed one night","This place is very charming! I loved the train theme throughout the place. The desk was perfect to get some much-needed writing done. This place wasn’t too far from Downtown Brownwood, and after a long day of exploring the town, I loved spending the night at this AirBnB. The host truly thought of everything to make this stay perfect-there is coffee for the morning, there are plenty of dishes for food, there’s a pullout couch if you want to lay down while watching tv in the living room, there are plenty of blankets to get cozy. The place has great air conditioning. The shower was wonderful. I use a cane because I have chronic pain, and there’s a ramp if you use any mobility aid plus the living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom are all close enough to each other which helped since I have some trouble walking. I can’t wait to come back here for another writing retreat!"

Let’s talk about the air conditioner: the bomb! I mean it is summer time texas hot and I appreciate the cool! I mean who doesn’t!
I am a writer and was happy to be in the space because it has such charm. Great desk to write at or little bar area!
You can chill outside and play games. Have a fire. Grill… Or be inside and chill with a clean/uncluttered space.
Easy to get to restaurants and right by the liquor store… which also had water which I appreciated!!!! Great selection of booze, wine and beer!
Book it!! Now!! Seriously!!!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was very cute and I had a huge backyard with a privacy fence. I didn’t have any pets, but if you had a dog the backyard would be awesome. The house was clean and comfortable. It’s my own fault that I missed the fact that there was no dishwasher.. so I headed out to Dollar General and got some rubber gloves.
Jenna was always helpful and answered the phone immediately. There is a bit of a problem with the septic system that you should ask her about."

We always hate to stay in town because we wind up driving back and forth so much. This place was literally 4 minutes away. It was peaceful, clean and fully stocked with everything. The kitchen was great, which allowed us to prepare food for the reunion. It was nice and cool with ceiling fans and comfortable beds that were perfect after a day of boating on the lake. We will definitely be back! Thank You for creating a great place!"

Keurig coffee pot and coffee pods/creamer were much appreciated! The bathroom was stocked with body wash, shampoo, conditioner, Q-tips, disposable toothbrushes and more. Beds were super comfy. Living room is cozy and neat. House is decorated tastefully and is easily accessible for all types of guests. We didn’t use it, but there is an outdoor fire pit, grill and small patio set to enjoy the backyard. Fenced in area for pets was a huge plus! Wi-Fi was fast and reliable. A/C was cold. I would definitely look into coming back to stay in this home if I were to plan a trip back to Brownwood. We were in for a short time and had an itinerary but driving through town, there looked to be some really neat places that we would love to peruse and take in. AAA+ accommodations!"

Stayed with a pet","At first, I was quite frustrated. We could not get the deadbolt unlocked and we did not have cell service. I drove back towards town in order to get cell service and Oscar was very quick to respond. He assured me which key should work. My gps took me down a washed out road but I drive a Jeep, so that wasn’t a big deal and it’s not Oscar’s fault. Got back to the house, my husband got the it unlocked. The neighbor came over to make sure we got in ok. Since I didn’t have cell service, I thought that was nice! My husband went to the local store and found out their WiFi was down, so that explained why there wasn’t internet at the house either. But the home was cozy, clean, decorated cute, and the AC worked GREAT! WiFi came back up, we had cell service and the rest of our stay was wonderful! It was super quiet and peaceful and we enjoyed our time there! Thanks, Oscar!"

Group trip","We loved the house, and it met our needs just perfectly. Our 9-day stay was wonderful. The house was decorated for Christmas. The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were spotless, and the showers were nice and hot with strong water pressure. We learned the first morning cooking breakfast how sensitive the smoke detector in the kitchen is! Turn on the fan over the stove and open the sliding door in the kitchen! LOL Having that full size washer and dryer was wonderful. Our phones mapping app (""G"") gave us directions to this address, and they were terrible directions and left us hanging but we found the house regardless. We had no idea how to work keyless entry and lockup, but we figured it out! We corresponded with the owner several times, and she always made time for us, and we never felt like we were an imposition. When we come back to the area to visit family, we would definitely stay here."

The tall ceilings make it feel SO spacious. Our family of 7 slept comfortably, plenty of seats, inside and out. We enjoyed the rocking chairs on the front porch, in the shade. The view of the lake is gorgeous.
The fridge was stocked with condiments, plenty of seasonings, pots and pans, so, so many little extras that no other airbnb provides.
There are a few abandoned homes nearby so we actually were grateful for the video surveillance! felt safe the whole week!
I would highly recommend this airbnb! Cynthia was quick to respond and very accommodating! Oh, the shower in the bathroom was roomy and spacious for my 85 yr old mother n law who needed a shower chair. This airbnb is A+"

We had two trucks with boats and had plenty of room for a third if needed. Just a sidenote, it is easier to back your boat into the driveway than to back it out. There is no room to turn around once you have pulled into the drive."

If you are there for the fishing, you may want to take advantage of the boats provided because the lake was relatively shallow off the dock when we visited.
We did catch a few nice fish though.
If you need peace and quiet, this is a nice place to find it."

I agree with other reviewers—the drive in may seem a little concerning, but we had absolutely no issues and felt very safe at Cynthia’s place. It will be worth it all!! I’m a detail person, and Cynthia has ALL the details covered: spotlessly clean, well-appointed kitchen, abundant towels (bath and beach), washer & dryer, comfortable beds, soft throws to snuggle under in the living room, multiple sitting areas outside...I could go on. I hope you love it as much as we did! I only hope we get the chance to return!"

Stayed with kids","SUCH a beautiful view and great place for a family to stay and have fun! Was lovely to have a variety of coffees and little creamers, red and white bottles of wine, and a big basket of snacks to greet us and have on our stay! We were there a little bit after the first week of April and there is a small, ADORABLE patch of bluebonnets outside the back window that you can take photos in front of!
They had a variety of fishing poles available with 4 lb and 6 lb fishing line spools, but we used the ones we brought. The gar were spawning and we saw at least one large gar swimming around the dock so we didn't catch much other than 1 small catfish, 1 small drum, and 2 small sunfish / perch that we threw back. (Had a ball fishing, though!)
Was really nice to have beautiful outdoor / yard space for little ones to run around in and to grill for dinner.
Nice variety of books / games on the shelf. (There were even 3 books for small children, 2 of which are Peppa Pig, which saved us as at bedtime when realized we had not remembered to bring any bedtime storybooks.)
As an FYI the room with the Texas-themed bedspreads / decor / bunk beds has a sliding barn door, just so you're aware. The ladder on the bunk bed can be removed in the even you have a child below age and need to make sure that child isn't tempted to get out of the bottom bunk and ""explore"" the top bunk.
Host was super responsive and very thoughtful! Lots of towels, nice toiletries, many spices / extras available in the kitchen (I think it's the best stocked kitchen I have ever encountered in an AirBnB). You can tell they have put a lot of thought and effort into this space.
Would highly recommend this host and place, you sure can't beat a lakeside sunset or sunrise!"

Stayed with kids","We truly enjoyed our stay here. The lake is very pretty and the house is tastefully remodeled with many smart amenities. It was especially well stocked with so many things that you may need such as spices, a Keurig, coffee, tea, creamers, a bottle of wine and waters in the fridge. That made our first night so nice as we ran out of time to stop at the grocery store on our long first travel day. The neighborhood left a bit to be desired as the roads in are a little rough and the homes around this one are in need of repair, but this home is tucked closer to the lake so you don’t readily see the neighbors and this home is well maintained and remodeled. Being on the lake was nice for beautiful sunsets and some any time fishing (she even has poles available to use). Cynthia has thought of everything you might need which is especially helpful if you are flying in!! The beds are comfy too! We enjoyed ourselves and would recommend this house to others."

It was fun for 7 of us (although a bit tight at times) to spend some time away. While this place is a bit remote we would even return outside of a pandemic and social distancing requirements. One thing to be careful of- there are lots of loose dogs in the “neighborhood” and I did get “bit” by one of them. Thankfully it didn’t break the skin. Still an awesome stay.

All the dish wares, silverware’s, pots and pan, and cutlery to cook meals during our stay. We even used the grill to cook hamburgers one night and grilled chicken legs another night.
There’s a stationary wine opener and a Keurig, which was a huge plus.
The home is beautifully decorated to fit the theme of a Lakehouse.
The grandkids went fishing with grandpa and that alone made it all worth it.
The only negative is that the neighborhood is not as well kept as this house. Some of the surrounding homes looked abandoned. A true gem once you reach the house and open the doors. Not what you would expect from the looks of the neighborhood.
With that said, we felt very safe and really enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend. Loved!Loved!Loved!"

Full kitchen, large comfy living room with big (smart) TV, nice dining area, 3 rooms, laundry room and plenty of space. The master bedroom was perfect with a comfortable bed, great bathroom and a nice sized closet.
The back yard was large with plenty of privacy and space for our dog to roam. They also had games for the kids with corn hole, washers and more. The grill was nice although we didn’t use it this trip.
The amenities were really nice as the place came fully stocked with what you need. Soap, shampoo, shaving cream, coffee, coffee filters, dish detergent, laundry detergent, dishes/plates, silverware, etc. They had everything we needed!
Definitely recommend this place. We will be staying here again!"

Stayed with kids","Jordan’ place is so cute and comfortable, contemporary decorations, great appliances, huge back porch and great hot tub! We went to this beautiful part of Texas to be close to the eclipse zone and this was just perfect! It was an easy drive to where we wanted to view the eclipse. Horses and goats on nearby properties, rolling hills and wild flowers everywhere we drove this time of year.
Jordan was proactively communicative, VERY nice and immediately responded to any questions we had.
The lake is very low on water, so you are not right on bigger lake water, but there is enough water right there that our daughter was able to catch some cute frogs (she immediately released them). It’s so pretty there- lots of trees, great view, and the perfect combination of easy to find but also set back from the main roads.
We highly recommend this home and Jordan!"

You can instantly tell how much time and effort Liz spent restoring the home, keeping as much from the original structure as possible, with new modern upgrades and decor. The home is perfect for medium to large gatherings with a very welcoming fenced in yard with ample seating. The home is located quite close to Brownwood’s downtown area, you technically could walk it, but it’s also about a three minute drive. I’d definitely recommend renting the home for your stay in town."

Overall the home is nicely decorated and had most things on hand that we needed. The master bed was not comfortable but we notified Vickie and hope that the problem will be resolved for the next guests.
The access to the lake is a bit difficult for my older mom. But Vickie had warned us of that so I'm not complaining. Just recognize what she meant now. There were chairs by the water to relax and enjoy. We were thankful for the relaxing weekend."

Vickies place is a cozy little cottage right on the lake. The place is stocked with everything you might need. Fishing was good right from the back yard. The only downside is no WiFi or no tv, which vickies place tells you that so it’s not a surprise that’s just a suggestion to make it a 5 star. Overall it was clean and cozy and we would rent again.

It's shocking when you discover the inflexibility of some hosts and oh so reassuring when you discover the integrity of a host like Vicki. We very much enjoyed a peaceful stay at Vicki's simple lakeside cottage. The sunsets are beautiful from the back yard. We actually survived no Wifi! We enjoyed watching Vicki's stash of old movies. It was a peaceful, sweet getaway. We walked in the state park in the mornings and took our ski boat out on the lake in the afternoons using public boat ramps. We pretty much had the lake to ourselves during out stay and that was pretty sweet. Many Thanks, Vicki."

The place was much nicer than even I expected. three bedrooms with plenty of beds if someone had a bigger group. There were only 2 of us but we were able to have family over and visit as well as eat out by the lake. When we make our next trip down to visit family we will definitely try to rent this place again. They have only had this as an AirBnB for a short time but I am convinced that as soon as enough people find out about this diamond they will be charging more than the $75 per night that we paid. There was so much more value here than you would ever get at a hotel and you would pay much more for a hotel room. I just can't speak highly enough about this place!

Stayed a few nights","Vicki was a wonderful host. I am a licensed Realtor and I manage 20 or so properties all in Galveston. It was nice to see how other hosts treat their guests.
Vicki has all the little extras one would need.
You will need a hot spot to use WiFi and she does not have cable. The hot spot will be used to run the options she provides via the Roku TV. Vicki said she would update her description stating such.
The home itself is not down justice y the photos online. You truly are right on the lack. I think adding a photo of the lake, taken directly from the back door would help guests realize how nice this property is. It truly is right on the lake. My mother-in-law enjoyed fishing which was such a nice surprise.
The home is pet friendly as well. Our Chessie enjoyed the yard and felt very at home.
The home is about 10 minutes from Brownwood. Several restaurants are right outside of the community and within a minutes drive. A Dollar Store is also close by.
You would be doing yourself a favor by renting from Vicki. This lake property is perfect for your next vacation. You will not be disappointed."

Highly recommend this to anyone that wants a place to get away or just needs a place to stay for a night or more. It is really nice. Jordan was very helpful and kind. He allowed us an early checkin even though we ended up getting there late. I think when you arrive your first thoughts will be WOW. Wonderful kitchen; well equipped, beautiful bedrooms and bathrooms. Very, very clean. It was such a comfortable place that it is really hard to describe, you just need to see for your self. Thank you Jordan."

The only thing that was unexpected was that there were 5 RV spots on the property too. There were only 2 RVs when we were there, so it wasn’t too crowded, but it was a little less private than the pictures represented. I still list it as 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anyone! It was a nice, relaxing spot to spend a couple days."

Stayed a few nights","This place is just cool. They’ve done a great job creating an affordable stay in an area that’s otherwise strangely expensive for small town Texas. Beats a hotel any day as having a kitchen and laundry facilities are included. I felt quite safe in the area. I am happy go lucky. There’s a little homeless activity but again it’s small town Texas and I felt for them far more than I’d be worried about them. A few cats came around which I fed and they kept to themselves otherwise. It all made it more enjoyable honestly. I got to feel like a local, which is what I like. It has a private feel to it though it’s a bit open aired. I can assure you this is a safe, well built, clean, & comfortable place to stay. They thought of just about everything from grilling, to corn hole, a gas fire pit, board games, & more. My only critique is actually a positive. The pictures don’t do it justice. I recommend having a professional photo the place to truly capture it’s esthetic and awesome outdoor space."

Stayed with kids","This was a repeat booking following our stay earlier this year. Lisa and Courtney again, were extremely welcoming and very responsive to any queries we had. They left us with an extremely clean and comfortable home, which made us feel like we were literally; at home.
Within 1/2 mile walking distance to Downtown, local restaurants/tap houses, shops and museums. There is a great coffee shop within 1/2 mile, Common Grounds Coffee. If you're into fitness; like I am, the local gyms (Anytime Fitness or Brownwood Fitness Centre) offer daily/weekly passes.
If you're feeling like chilling ""at home"" one night, Lisa and Courtney offer a very private communal area (between the two stations) with beautiful evening lighting and outside activities, a grill, romantic firepit table that we used to make smores with our little girl... and plenty of seating! It's very comfortable, and you can really appreciate the time and attention put into these vacation homes.
Will be booking again"

Stayed with kids","Lisa & Courtney were perfect hosts when we arrived on this ""Rare Find"" that we came across on AirBnb, on a last minute search for accommodation in Brownwood. This accommodation did NOT disappoint! The space is very thoughtfully decorated with a subtle railroad theme, which is appropriate given its distance from the railroad museum. It is very warm and inviting from the moment you step in the door. It's a very easy walk to Downtown Brownwood and local coffee shop (Commonwealth Coffee). We were so impressed with this experience that we have already re-booked for another week. Thanks for being such amazing hosts!
p.s. I would like to thank y'all again for reaching out to return my husbands favourite shirt. That was extremely sweet of you to be in contact with us pretty quickly to make sure you caught us!"

Stayed with kids","The place was just as described and a great place to spend time with family/friends. The beds were all pretty comfortable which is always a bonus. The kitchen was well stocked and cooking was pretty seamless. The dining table was plenty big enough for the 8 adults and 2 kids we had but wouldn’t fit much more than that. Internet was good enough to stream movies but the WiFi wasn’t great so we kept phones on cell mostly.
A few things to note that are not a negative to the host at all. The neighborhood is a little strange and neighbors the driveway is shared with don’t look thrilled to be next to a rental property but weren’t rude about it. There is also some sort of construction going on where I think they were in reverse for two days straight (beep beep beep).
And very sad that the lake is so low so we didn’t really get to enjoy that much. A cart to take stuff down to the water would be a great idea since it is so far down right now.
Overall would recommend!"

And the kitchen was well-stocked with serving bowls, storage bowls, spoons, etc. Plenty of chairs so 12 or more people could sit at one time. There was also room for multiple cars on the property if everyone drives in. If you want a vacation in a quiet environment, with lots of space for people to visit or get away by themselves, near a lake, this place is it."

The movement through out the house gave everyone a place to go if they needed to unwind for a bit. But there was also room for us all to eat our meals together & play in the game areas. The home also comes well equipped! There were plenty of extra blankets, sheets, towels, board games, kitchen items, etc. and the laundry room was a bonus for all the lake activities we did. The best part is they’re pet friendly & our dogs had a blast, just like the rest of us. 100% recommend :)"

Group trip","We absolutely loved this bnb as a family of 6! Plenty of room and beds for each of us to be comfortable. Beds were huge and very nice, you don't feel like you're sinking in, like at most other places. dining room was a good size for us. The proximity to the water is unbeatable of course, we also really liked wild duck marina just down the street, both for sunset views (which you can just get on your back porch as well), dining (breakfast is really good here!), and fishing supplies.
The amenities are 10/10 and second to none. You have everything from hammocks (clean!), to kayaks, lily pads, dock lights for night fishing, and plenty of lounge chairs, and of course the indoor game room. Our dog loved the fenced in yard as well. Last but not lease, the check in and check out times are second to none - the most generous of any bnb we've stayed at by far.
The only con is the amount of bugs and mosquitos hanging around, just make sure you bring plenty of off spray. Also, the wifi is a bit spotty and slow. Good enough to just browse but I definitely wouldn't be working from here.
Also, if you come during wildflower season (may-ish), the drive to get here is phenomenal."

Stayed with kids","Wonderful place for a group/family getaway to the lake! Hostess is amazing and accommodations are great! The sunsets over the lake will sooth your soul. The furnishings and decor are much more than you’d expect at your typical lake house - and the game room, what fun! If you want a great weekend at the lake, this place can’t be beat. Add this one to your list of family adventures and you won’t be disappointed."

Would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to get a large group together and have a fun and relaxing time."

Group trip","A nice getaway for a group. Ample outdoor space, fenced in yard, and large fire pit. Road leading up to house has many potholes so drive carefully! Nice kitchen and propane grill -though we had to replace the tank after one use. Store in is about 15 minutes away so it was no problem. Check out Spirit of Texas Winery about 30 minutes away - bring a cooler of snacks and enjoy the wine tastings!"

Group trip","This place was so ouch more than expected and had everything you might need plus more, they have plenty of space to have a big get together and enjoy the space and not be cramped. I would recommend this if you have a big family. Plus having access to Lake Brownwood is so awesome and also there is Lake Proctor 1 hour away both places with great fish and beautiful scenery. Great place for kids to hang out and play in the backyard and they even have a fish cleaning station in the back by the dock. Definitely we will be repeat customers!!!"

Stayed with kids",Great place! The hospitality was amazing. They knew we were coming to have our Christmas with our new grandson. We arrived to Christmas lights hung in the trees. We had coordinated to bring our own Christmas tree but they had put a few decorations up throughout the house. The layout of the house is great. We had lots of family there so we could all be in one area opening gifts or we could “get away” from each other when needed because there were multiple rooms to hangout in. There are plenty of bedrooms/beds. And we never had a problem with bathroom availability. There are multiple TVs in the house. There are a multitude of cooking utensils/supplies. The kitchen was nice and open so several people could be in there at one time. We enjoyed spending time on the back porch also. I would definitely recommend this getaway.

Stayed with kids","Because the hostess did such a great job describing the place, everything was exactly as described and therefore met our needs and expectations. We loved that check-in was earlier than most places and hotels, and that check-out time was later at 3:00. The beds were all super comfy, and we loved the eclectic decorations and charming touches in every room. The upstairs is super cute and seems to go on forever. You would never guess from the outside that this house has so many rooms (including game room) and is two-story. Amenities galore, beautiful waterfront view and separate fenced yard were perfect for our 3 families. So fun!! You won’t regret staying here!!"

What an adventure... just what we needed to get reacquainted 🙂 thank you"

It was very clean, and Jordan was very responsive; I had trouble finding the place, but I messaged Jordan and he quickly responded and helped me find it - I was a couple of blocks away. I was not expecting to stay by myself when I arrived, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I did so, and was a little scared, not being from the area and not knowing what kind of area I was staying in. Everyone I interacted with in Brownwood during my stay, including Jordan, were super nice. Nowm being familiar with the place & the area, I would stay there again. Thank you, Jordan, for making your place feel very inviting. I enjoyed my stay."
