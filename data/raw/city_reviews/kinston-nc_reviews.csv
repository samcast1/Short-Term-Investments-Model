Stayed a few nights","The place was awesome before. But the upgrade with the jacuzzi, firepit, & outside TV. It made the experience that much better. Also new color of the house was a great idea. The location of the house was perfect . Easy to find & close to everything or place. Louis & Isabell were always an email, text, or phone call away. Which made communication very easy. This is going to be our home away from home. If it's available when we come back down here. Thanks Again"

Even with neighbors it feels very private and would definitely come back if it’s available the next time we come down. Also it’s about a hour drive at most from so many different locations that you can visit.

Stayed with kids","Upon arriving , due to neighborhood and accommodating space we overlooked a few things. On Saturday morning we were awaken by The Yard Clean up Crew 10:15am who rudely informed us that Louis knew they were coming. After a couple of hours of leaf blowers and chain saws we questioned how long will they be there, they stated all day, they left at 4:45 pm . I guess they called Louis and told him we were questioning them , because i find an email at 6:22pm that was sent at 12:40pm stating he would have them leave and return when we check out, if that was what we wanted. We felt so disrespected , we were not informed prior to arrival that this was taking place at 1015am the next morning and we would have no access to the yard the entire day . We would not have paid for this."

Group trip","We (5 adults) stayed at the property between Christmas and New Year’s. We have family in the area so we have been to Kinston many times before.
We lived the location of the house, very peaceful and quiet but close to all major roads. There was enough space for all of us to relax, work, and hang out.
We loved the garage with all the games! We spent pretty much every evening there!
The showers never ran out of hot water, all appliances worked, and the place was clean and uncluttered!
We highly recommend staying there and we will do it again when we have to visit the area!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the 4th class trip that we've spent in town being hosted by the amazing Louis and Isabel. we've loved all the days that we have spent in this peaceful space. We have been in town from all over the state taking a medical class, and this place was perfect for our group. Everybody has their own space to be comfortable, the smart tvs were perfect for casting our study sessions onto, and the garage was great for relaxing after a day of class. The hosts have been amazing to work with and have gone above and beyond, making us comfortable as well as working with our schedules. I would definitely recommend this space for any type of group or family!!! Thank you both for taking such good care of us."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at Louis' place for two weeks while we were in town checking on one of our projects. We stay in AirBNB's all across the US due to us traveling so much with our company and this place just ""felt like home"". It was plenty of space for my family and an extra co-worker (plus our dogs!!!). The neighborhood is peaceful, the house is spotless and there is SO MUCH ROOM! The garage.....the boys LOVED IT. We had several competitive bets going on the pool table and air hockey, and I'm pretty sure they are all wore out from playing basketball. Every room had it's own huge tv, which is useful when I was the only woman in a house of menLouis was incredibly responsive and immediately got back with me when I needed to ask a question. We were only reserved for one week, but needed longer and decided we didn't want to go to any other place. We are still in town and unfortunately this week wasn't available, or else we'd have booked again. I can't say enough good things about this place"

Stayed a few nights","As a group of Fire, Ems, and Law personnel we really enjoyed our stay in town for School. We found this place to be exactly what we needed. The space is well laid out and it provides a great area for us to rest, study and relax. The game area is an awesome addition that would be great for any group or family while in town. We found everything we needed inside to be able to comfortably stay. Smart TVs all over so nobody had to fight for control of the remote!! The hosts are amazing and offered all kinds of support and communication before, during, and after our stay. We look forward to coming back and staying again. We WILL be back!!!"

It was very peaceful and the surroundings were beautiful. I enjoyed the front porch very much! My view was a beautiful field. I thought I had an issue with locking the door and David responded to me in minutes. I found him very easy to talk to. We really didn't want to leave! I only wish we could've stayed longer.

Stayed a few nights","David's contemporary abode offered me a safe feeling in an unfamiliar place. The only slight problem I had was trying to figure out light switches and TV connections, but once I got in touch with David for clarification, all was well. Maybe add a little cheat sheet explaining how to work all the lights and the heat? For people like me who may not be able to grasp the obvious! :) Good value and very pleasant. A great place to rest after my long days in a training program in Kinston."

All the little details, such as marked lights in the house, clear parking next to the porch, and a labeled kitchen, were a nice touch. This was a pleasant stay and a place I would book again."

Stayed a few nights","This was a very nice home and we were impressed with the home cleanliness and decorations. The hosts were responsive and very nice.
The only issue we had was in regard to the bedroom situation. We all read the advertisement wrong thinking it was 3 bedrooms with beds all set up. In actuality it was 2 bedrooms with beds. The other BR doubles as an activity room and a blow up mattress could be used as well as a small fold out futon.
For 6 full grown adults in our 60's it wasnt what were wanted. We had to send one couple to the local hotel because i couldn't ask them to sleep on a blow up mattress on the floor.
If it was 4 grown ups with 4 kids you could throw them into the activity room that would probably work fine.
Adults only is really only for 4 not 6 or 8"

Stayed with a pet","The good: this house I clean, conveniently located, pet friendly, and we felt safe. We loved the fenced yard. The house is older and has a lot of charm as a result. We were comfortable. This town is clearly old and trying to revitalize, and this house reflects efforts to maintain its charm while doing so.
The not so good: when we arrived, the WiFi was not working. We messaged at ~9:30 the night of check in that it was not working and did not get a response until 12:45pm the following day. Unfortunately, as we had digital work to do, this was very inconvenient. We searched for the router and did not initially find it. On our second day, we located it *unplugged* behind the bed. This should have been checked before we arrived. The WiFi is slow but acceptable when functioning. The shower drains VERY slow, so it’s a race between you and the drain not to risk flooding the bathroom.
We would stay here again, and I think it’s a good stay. It could use a little more attentiveness."

Would have enjoyed walking to the local brewery just down the street if we'd had more time. We really appreciated that it was pet friendly. Neighborhood is perhaps still a bit on the ""up and coming from humble roots"" side, but there seemed to be other airbnb type rentals on the street and neighbors were quiet and respectful. Communication with host was excellent."

There’s a children’s park a short walk away, as well as downtown where you will find very cute boutiques and great food. The home is a quaint older home built probably in the 1920s or 30s. The kitchen is quite large and well stocked. The yard is fantastic if you have children or animals. It was nice to have an Airbnb that allowed my small dog. The neighbors are very quiet, the street is really quiet and I highly recommend this Airbnb."

However, for long term stays do be aware that you’ll have to be going to the laundry mat, and there is no dishwasher. We travel with our dogs so the back yard area was very nice for them.
While we didn’t have any issues, the surrounding area is a little rough. The downtown area is very close which was convenient to go to dinner and the local brewery. Communication with the hosts were great and were very accommodating."

Everything you could possibly need was provided (dishes, glasses, mugs, coffee, cream, juice, utensils, toaster, microwave, etc). Very comfy bed. Shower had great pressure and water temperature was great. Plenty of towels. The outdoors will leave you in awe. Birds, squirrels, butterflies, the fire pit (we loved doing a fire both nights) the water fountain, it was so peaceful and comfortable. Didn’t miss not having a tv at all! Bonnie is a Super host and we couldn’t have been happier! Place is off the beaten path but we truly did not care. We just drove to ichiban bistro about 15 minutes away. Highly recommend it!! Delicious Japanese food. Very reasonably priced as well. We didn’t want to leave Bonnie’s place. Safe and beautiful countryside."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Bonnie’s place so I could attend graduation at ECU for a friend and the location was great. About 20-25 minutes to Greenville/ECU. This little cabin looks exactly like the pictures! I was travelling alone and felt very safe even in a remote area. Bonnie was very proactive in communication and I never had to ask for anything. She had covered it all in our messages or information/note in the cabin. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great!! If I am ever back in the area, Bonnie’s little cabin will be where I am staying. I can't say enough good things about my stay! Thanks Bonnie for making my trip so peaceful and relaxing!"

Stayed one night","Great host - very communicative, gives clear instructions on how to arrive. Great place - you can really tell there is a lot of care and details put into this little cabin. We were only here one night due to an event at ECU (Eastern Carolina University), but we're happy we found this place and it was a lot nicer and more fun than staying at a hotel. ECU is only 25 minutes away; the next morning we had breakfast in Washington (per the host's recommendation) which is 20 minutes away and has a beautiful historic riverfront."

Stayed one night","We only stayed for one night. And I could have easily extended our stay. The cabin is so cute, quaint and cozy. My husband initially raised his eyebrows to the fact there is no TV. Welp it was never needed. We were so comfortable just relaxing in the front room rocking in the recliners. Lastly the outside landscaping is GORGEOUS. Bonnie even has a firepit available for guest. If you would like time away by yourself or with 1 other person this is the perfect place!"

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough about just how perfect my stay with Lars and Sylvia was during the week-long stay there during my initial start of a new job at the Kinston airport. They made me feel like family from the start, were incredibly sweet and accommodating and by the time I left, I felt like I had made two amazing long-term friends. The location was killer for access to the airport (approximately 5 min. drive) and their friendly dogs welcomed me into their pack too, and were just as nice as their owners. I’m returning for the next two months until my permanent move to the area this summer and highly recommend staying here as the hosts make you feel at home and are so easy going. We had great conversations and a lot of fun!"

I was offered both dinner and fresh baked cookies, and was told to make myself at home. The bed was very comfortable and plush. Plenty of pillows! The private bath was spacious and included some travel toiletries. The dogs were also very friendly, so I'd recommend guests be comfortable with dogs if they plan to book. No pet hair or anything in the guest space (didn't notice it anywhere, actually). Overall a very pleasant stay, and I would certainly return in the future if I'm in the area."

Stayed with kids",The house was extremely tidy. Lots of great thoughtful touches were provided by the host. The neighborhood is not as close to town but is quiet for sure. We had plenty of space for our family of 5. The one negative for my husband and I would be that the bedroom with just one queen bed needs a new mattress it sagged to the middle. However my kids slept great in the larger room with the two full beds. Danielle is a very quick and communicative host!

Stayed with a pet","Sadly we had to cancel the stay 4 days before checkout due to a cockroach infestation.
I spoke to Danielle and she explained the water bugs are a normal thing in NC . She showed her concern yet did not did not worked with us to credit the days we did not used.
Our daughter woke up with a cockroach on her, that was disgusting and totally unacceptable for a supposedly glamorous place.
The patio deck was not clean and the cockroaches would not allow anyone to relax, they practically own the place and fly all over it. We killed more than fifteen roaches in 3 days.
Totally unacceptable.
My husband and I covered the patio cámaras, we do not like the feeling of being observed, because of that reason Danielle assume we did not wanted lights on for privacy….The lights for the patio were turned off without a notice. Only to ask later if we wanted the patio lights on, which to us was common sense.
Sadly this place is not a place We will recommend for anyone to stay unless, whoever stays is okay with cockroaches in bed, kitchen, and patio."

The space is very clean, very nice design. (Loved that they had awesome shampoo/body wash in the shower for us, nice bonus) We were all very comfortable while we were visiting. Thanks so much!"

I loved the huge kitchen! My only suggestion would be to add a sitting chair in the bedrooms, so that you could sit and change clothes vs sitting on the bed after showering. Also, I would suggest that the one TV be smart TV to stream or cast to from another smart device. Other than that I was pleased."

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed the house and it fit exactly what I was looking for. Plenty of space and private inside for multiple guests. My one disappointment was with the WIFI and TV services. WIFI was spotty for me consistently connecting and disconnecting. TV service was also spotty but that may have been due to the tropical storm that below in during our stay. In either case, I could not stream movies to my phone through the WIFI and the digital antenna simply did not get the job done.
If asked, yes I would stay there again."

Communication with Stephnie was both quick, and easy. She’s a great host. And it’s a great property. it has very spacious rooms. And supplies all the amenities. Even a great selection of coffee! All the rooms have a nice fresh coat of paint. And the walls are adorn with local art of local establishments. I thought this was an amazing touch.
Everything was spotless. The beds were comfy. And the cleaning products in the bathroom were quite nice.… Oh yeah, let’s not forget the backyard it is super spacious and perfectly flat. Great to just sit out and relax in.
The best compliment I can give this property is that I would have no problem staying here again"

The neighborhood is very cool and the neighbors are extremely nice. I cannot recommend the Coffee Bar House more highly. The one thing I want to point out is the TV is just over-the-air broadcast, so if you have an Apple TV/Fire Stick/Etc, bring it, if you want to watch a wider variety of shows. It's not a big deal at all, especially for a short stay, but just something to keep in mind when you book. I can't wait to stay here again!"

Very comfy beds, extremely clean, quick responses to questions and handling service requests, well-stocked kitchen with decent cooking equipment (a rarity in my experience), plenty of towels, soap, essentials. It's obvious the owners take pride in this little house. It's not terribly close to the ocean (1-2 hr depending on the beach), but 45 min. from New Bern which is fun to explore. The town itself has a lot of history and friendly people. Would love to stay again!"

Creamer and water bottles or snacks would be a nice touch. ""Coffee House"" implies that touch and just having a Keurig with pods is an amenity every hotel or motel offers.
Shotty pary of town and paint job as well."

Stayed one night","We had the most fabulous trip. We went to Kinston to meet our new Grandblessing and Celebrate 2 Birthday's.
This is a very beautiful and spacious rental. The decor is beautiful. I have recommend a few things that would have made our review great instead of good.
1. Extra garbage bags for the kitchen and bathrooms are definitely needed when you rent for multiple days. We had to purchase some.
2. There are no mixing bowls. Its difficult when cooking meals and/or baking.
3. There was not a cupcake/muffin pan there but we bought one and left it there.
4. Additional bathroom toiletries may need to be requested for extended stays if you travel light.
5. Additional laundry pods may be needed for extended stays. One was provided.
6. The floor as you walk into the living room is kind of weak. If you are heavy, be safe.
This was our very first Air B&B stay. I am actually familiar with the area from working at the local hospital for almost 9 years. A few of my friends that are local stopped by to visit while we were there and were completely impressed with this rental. I assured them that they must refer it to their friends and family that will visit Kinston.
The neighbors are sweet. The yard is FANTASTIC. The park that is in walking distance is AMAZING.
I pray that this rental is available for our next extended visit. I can not wait to bring my nieces and nephews. The couch is amazing. It is so large and as comfy.
Thank you for providing this beautiful safe place to stay. We are now Air B&B hooked and can not wait to try others.
P.s. The Christmas lights all lit up upon our arrival made us smile so big. It was beautiful. Magical after a very long 11 hour drive.
Relaxing in front of the Christmas Tree on your comfy couch was the perfect way to start our stay.
Thank you so much for allowing us to make such amazing memories."

I enjoyed being able to cook in the kitchen--there was everything I needed to make a pancake and bacon breakfast, along with baking birthday brownies. As I now have a new little niece, I'll be visiting Kinston often, and will book this house each time I return."

We didn’t expect to find such a gem in rural NC! I was there for a quick trip to visit family and needed a space to accommodate our family of 4 with two small children. The listing and overwhelmingly positive reviews for this place seemed too good to be true, but they were spot on!
Rich and Tisha were excellent hosts. The place was absolutely spotless and had all the amenities listed, including some surprises. They had a chilled bottle of wine for us in the fridge … bottles of water … lots of coffee k cups and tea!
And they surprised us with some danishes in the fridge on the first day, and Rich stopped by to greet the family and bring fresh bananas. Talk about great service!
You can tell they really take care of the place and enjoy hosting guests.
My son enjoyed exploring the grounds and even played horse shoes. They even had a spare crib and high chair! Great for families traveling with limited space.
We hope to be back someday."

We really enjoyed the gym and sauna downstairs. The land is second to none from the walking trail, river lot and Rich letting us feed the cows.

The attention to detail did NOT go unnoticed when we first arrived, Tish and Richard did such an amazing job of making us feel welcomed and comfortable. Richard was so attentive and we couldn’t have had a better experience. The place was so great for a weekend getaway and there was so much land for us to walk the dogs, I know they loved it too. Also really enjoyed the gym, great amenity!! Thank you tish and Richard, we would love to come back :)"

We only wish it would be available more often, but happy that so many others have discovered this gem. These are the most gracious hosts you’ll ever meet and their carriage house is exceptionally clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. The kitchen has everything you may need, even a pantry. And the bathrooms are equipped with essentials and an abundance of towels. For that added touch of hospitality, Rich and Tish provide a few goodies for your first breakfast which is yet another thoughtful gesture. Our dogs always enjoy roaming the farm and we have loved the peace and serenity this oasis provides. Thank you, Rich and Tisha, for your hospitality and kindness!"

They actually “host” meaning they greet you and are around for anything you need while still giving you complete privacy. They live up to the “BnB” part by supplying coffee and breakfast items. They have gone above and beyond to ensure the guesthouse has everything any visitor could need. Plus their farm and animals create a beautiful destination for a relaxing getaway. I just can’t say enough good things and would love to return!!

Rich and Tisha were outstanding hosts. They checked in with us regularly to ensure our comfort and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was flawless. Their warmth and hospitality made us feel right at home, and we knew we could count on them for anything we needed.
Whether you're planning a romantic getaway or a trip with family and friends, I can't recommend this place enough. It truly exceeded all our expectations and has set the bar incredibly high for future stays. Thank you, Rich and Tisha, for creating such a wonderful retreat and for being such fantastic hosts.

Stayed a few nights","Wallace Meadows Farm is comfortable, relaxing, and quiet—a peaceful place to hang your hat and rest your head. Rich and Tisha have thought of everything and put extra love and care into each and every detail of their beautiful guesthouse. This rejuvenating farm setting is perfect for families, couples, and even single travelers. The hosts (including sweet Labradoodle pup, Ginger!) are kind, accommodating, and friendly. The view from the balcony just off the primary bedroom is breathtaking, but no more so than at night when an endless expanse of stars meets your naked eye. We were so blessed to visit this sweet Airbnb home for a couple of days and are already hoping we can come back for another stay sometime. Thank you, Wallaces, for your generosity and hospitality. Between the coziness of the beds and pillows to the humorous braying of your donkey below our bedroom window, this was a truly unforgettable weekend! We had a blast!"

There was a Christmas tree, Christmas comforters and little snowman around that made it quite festive! Rich came to my door with Ginger...as she is the official Wallace Farms greeter! Heard Dominic the Donkey only once, which was adorable! Rich got some of the treat kibble and let me feed the cows! Lucky, the bottle baby stud was the most gentle and beautiful cow! He and one of the black and white cows just had a baby less than a week ago! I brought my pup Lola and she loved every minute of the stay! She chased the goose and sniffed the chickens! There is a beautiful walking trail that will lead you to the river.... absolutely majestical! I'm a city girl, and so is Lola....so the beautiful clear skies with millions of stars to see at night and fresh country air was AMAZING! Couldn't recommend this Airbnb enough!

We enjoyed time by the fire pit each night and our daughter loved looking at the planets using the recommended apps.

My family and recently stayed at the Wallace Farm and since the first day we arrived Richard and Tisha received us with open arms and a warm heart. The house where we stayed was so cozy, clean and filled with all the essentials plus many nice perks such as welcoming 1 day breakfast with Wallace Farm fresh eggs, water bottles, orange juice, a sorted of coffee and teas plus a full loaded kitchen with essential items to stay there forever...lol. ;) This place was glorious and breath taking because of its location, scenery, in door gym and of course the guest house is breath taking. I have decided to return to the Wallace Farmhouse next year during the summer and stay a few weeks instead of only 6 days, so that I can fully enjoy the farm with the cows, chicken and donkey. This Air BNB is a 10 +++++ and I recommend anyone searching for a nice quint place to stay here. You and family will enjoy this place including the creek down below where you can have a picnic and even a bar-b-q to enjoy the day. Thank you, Richard and Tisha, for welcoming my family I to your farm guest house. We are looking forward in returning very soon. take care and God Bless you both! Mary Hurst and Family"

Rich and Tisha have thought of everything you could possibly need for a stay away from home and they have taken care to provide it. They are easily reached but the guesthome is very private. I really cant say enough about this property the description doesnt do it justice. AMAZING

By far, better than any hotel and worth the visit. Our family enjoyed the personal greeting by Rich, the breakfast essentials, as well as feeding the cows their dinner! We intend to be back next year and make Wallace Meadows a part of our family tradition."

Stayed a few nights","We were planning our return to the farm within the first ten minutes of being here!!!
To say these host's have thought of EVERYTHING would be an understatement! I can't even list it all because this review would turn into a tome, but I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
We loved sitting out on the deck, reading and looking at the cows in the pasture. We walked the perimeter of the farm, checked out the pond and the river, it was all amazing! We were looking for a quiet place to relax and that's exactly what we found. The only thing better than the apartment and farm were the hosts themselves. Rich, Tisha and their super sweet four-legged baby, Ginger were so pleasant and accommodating.
If you're looking for a beautiful farm to relax and enjoy the views/animals, etc. with amazing hosts, look no further!
I can't recommend these hosts enough! Thank you for the memories and we'll definitely be back!"

Every room was well thought out and executed in design, construction, and decor. Great water pressure, hot water, views from master suite deck, crisp & clean linens, plush robes, complete kitchen, full breakfast items including the best, freshest eggs from their farm. Mints on the pillows will welcome you at the end of a long day. An amazing trail around the farm including a hidden river treasure at the back of the property. Everything listed is spot on and then some. Hosts Rich and Tisha are just as friendly as their adorable pup Ginger, who will come and greet you as if you are a long time family member coming home. I plan to return for a longer stay and include a visit to New Bern for some history education and shopping!"

They leave no stone unturned when it comes to your stay from the cleanliness of the guest house to the little touches of a personal note, wine, apple turnovers in the fridge (along woth goodies for breakfast), and then York peppermint Patties waiting for you on your pillow...and then omg the things to do outside, from enjoying the farm animals to sitting on the balcony, to walking the trails, enjoying the pond, or fishing on the river...it's just PERFECT!!!

Handwritten welcome notes. Wine waiting for you. Stocked pantry - extra dishes and pans if there's a crowd. Pastries, orange juice and eggs in the fridge. An entire gym and sauna. Walking trails. The thoughtful touches were welcome, unexpected, and raised the bar on every future travel destination. The house itself is so well laid out, the furniture is solid and oh, so comfortable. Everything is in tip-top shape and immaculate, and the hosts, Richard and Tisha and Ginger are so very kind and welcoming. The property is beyond gorgeous - do not miss walking down to the river. I did not want to leave, and I will be back."

Richard and Tisha thought of everything to help me do just that. I visited the farm with my 2 dogs and we had a wonderful time exploring the acres and stretching our legs on the jogging trail. I enjoyed the observation deck with the cool breeze for reading and sunbathing. The private gym was amazing and I came back in better shape than when I left! The guest house couldn't have been better organized and outfitted. It was a true home away from home...light and bright, tastefully decorated, very clean and comfortable. The hosts provided the extra touches that made me feel appreciated...a bottle of wine, a dozen farm-fresh eggs, and a complete breakfast for the first day! There were cozy robes in the closet, toiletries, books, games, and a well-stocked kitchen for cooking.
I can't say enough good things about the hosts, they were attentive and available while being respectful of my privacy. They even allowed my dogs to run around in their fenced yard while I took a dip in their hot tub!
I can't wait to go back to the farm soon!"

The gym and sauna is a nice addition especially since the weather was bad it gave us something to do. Richard was nice enough to let our two kids feed the animals and have a up close and personal experience with the chicks and cows! Thank you so much even tho our stay was short it was truly appreciated.

We experienced the same high level of hospitality, cleanliness and comfort, but they’ve added new amenities and even a state-of-the-art gym. No detail has been overlooked from a fully-stocked kitchen (farm fresh eggs!) to plush bath towels to the most sumptuous beds, staying at Wallace Meadows is a respite and a treat. We look forward to many more visits and to enjoying this slice of Southern hospitality at its finest."

They both make an effort to talk/introduce themselves. They also are quick to assist when you contact them. The kitchen was stocked with food for our first morning, and there was a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us when we walked through the door. The house was perfectly clean and also welcoming. The nature trail was by far my favorite part. We made sure to at least walk every morning after enjoying coffee on the balcony. We cannot wait to go back again and relax on their farm!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our second time visiting this year and it was just as lovely and relaxing as the first. Our corgi, Finn, was at home as soon as he leapt out of the car. He loves playing with Ginger.
This time we had my parents meet us at the farm and they loved it as much as we did.
We drove to Ayden one afternoon to grab some BBQ at Skyline Inn BBQ. Highly recommended! We also drove over to New Bern one afternoon and a lovely time at the farmer’s market and perusing downtown.
Besides enjoying the sights and sounds of the cows and chickens, it was nice walking the property around the pastures and down to the river.
We also enjoyed the beautiful weather and spent a lot of time around the fire pit roasting marshmallows, listening to tunes, and making S’mores.
The guesthouse is very cozy with comfortable beds and nice amenities.
It was also nice to sit out on the balcony in the morning and sip some coffee while enjoying the peaceful surroundings.
Rich and Tish are very pleasant, responsive, and willing to help with anything you need.
Looking forward to coming back in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, house worked well for a weekend in Kinston. House is roomy and has historic character, with excellent location near downtown. We also appreciated the towels/toiletries. House mostly very clean, but several hairs on bathroom floor made me think that area hadn't been vacuumed thoroughly. The ad did warn about ""potential for noise,"" which turned out to mean loud rap music across the street for an extended period after midnight. (Also, not the host's fault in the least, but the other side of the house fronts a rough-looking area with dogs kept penned and tied up outside during our entire visit, which as animal lovers we found disturbing.) This house would work well for a group; just manage your expectations about the location. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and everybody loved the house, especially with the nice front porch to enjoy our coffee."

The house is very kid-friendly as well.
Our only criticism is that the room with the bunk beds, where kids are most likely to sleep, does not get adequate air conditioning. It would be best to bring your own fan to try to get some cool air into that room. Otherwise, a great place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","Great house and yard. Our family of 10 stayed here, with children ages 6-14 and had a great week. It was a quick drive to see all the Kinston sites. The house was super clean and it was the best product (shampoo/conditioner/soap) and towel amenities we have ever had at an AirBNB. Additionally, the coffee options in the kitchen, the pots/pans/utensils, the cleaning supplies were the best I have every seen at any AirBNB. We could really cook in house all week very easily and the layout of the kitchen made it party central. The only downsides were that a bunch of lights were out, bathroom fixtures were broken etc. (80% were fixed very promptly)
Things to consider if you are going to stay here:
1. There are a LOT of doors to the outside, including from the kids bunk room. While all had deadbolts, it did make us nervous that one of the kids would easily get outside and we would never hear them.
2. The lights were out in most of the porch lights, which made us feel a little uncomfortable because the area is a little run down (boarded up houses nearby etc). But we had ZERO issues the entire week.
3. The light in the dining room is so dim it's really challenging to play board games and do art projects that require the ability to read small details or done any ""fine details"" on crafts because it's just...dark. So the kids (and adults who are older!) struggled with that.
4. And if they weren't playing games/doing crafts, they wanted to stream movies. But the big tv in the main room that is pictured is not a smart tv and we could only get one station.
We had a wonderful and fun week there - the house was the perfect layout and size. We would definitely consider staying again if we came back to Kinston! It was a fun trip!"

The location is decent. Its about a 2 minute drive to downtown Kinston. There are train tracks a few blocks away, so you will have to drive a few extra blocks to go around them depending on which direction you are traveling. My only complaint is minor. There is just one television in the house, which is located in the living room. It would be nice if the bedrooms also had televisions in them. There is wifi, so that sort of makes up for it. At least until its time to charge your devices. I highly recommend booking if you are visiting Kinston with a large family."

Stayed with kids","Lovely place for a big family get together. We had 4 generations in the house for a wedding and it was perfect. The littles could run around and make all the noise they wanted and so could Grandpa. The 3 bathrooms made things so much easier and the big kitchen was perfect for making sandwiches while visiting and catching up. Not sure if we will ever make it back that way all together again, but it was perfect for the occasion. Thanks Stephanie."

The 16 month old loved going through each room, to look for us. It was a good place for her, to use up some energy. We liked having the multiple bathrooms, and the kitchen's large island was really nice. We would definitely stay there again when visiting the Kinston area."

We loved our time there, the only thing that people should know about is that the only way to access the bunk-bed room is by walking through the room with three double beds. Not a huge deal, but it impacted who slept in which rooms for our group. Really cute yard, great for group photos, and Kinston was lovely! Lots of great places to take pictures and enjoy the art. Will definitely stay here if ever in the area again!"

The fenced yard and porch were great for the kids to play and an awesome playground was just a short walk away. Adults enjoyed the comfy beds and spacious rooms. We appreciated being able to eat and play games in the dining room while the teens and kids ate in the kitchen and enjoyed movies down the hall in the living room. The neighborhood was quiet, and any needed groceries or supplies were a quick drive away."

made us feel immediately welcomed.
The decor was a perfect blend vintage meets modern, and everything was exquisite, inviting, and pristine.
Although temperatures were in the mid 80's with high humidity, Charlotte had the A/ on and fans blowing in some rooms, so it felt delightful.
Every room had lovely scented candles and lovely soft throws, lending to a relaxing and slightly romantic atmosphere.
I returned from my conference on Saturday evening, put on some P.J.'s and wrapped in one of those super soft shows. I laid down on the couch, and woke 3 hours later. Thanks Charlotte, I needed that."
