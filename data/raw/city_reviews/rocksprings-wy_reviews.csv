Group trip","Overall my family and I had a nice stay. We came in to visit extended family for Christmas and this house was very conveniently located. Pet friendly is always a big plus! We had some food to prepare for Christmas and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. A few days into our stay we had some trouble with the furnace, and Josh made himself available on Christmas Eve to personally come fix it. We are very appreciative that he took care of that for us. Everything else about the house was pleasant and comfortable."

Stayed a few nights",Came out to work and stayed at this Airbnb. Everything was nice except for no shampoo or soap in the shower. Also I’m pretty sure the host was using cameras to spy on us. We didn’t smoke inside the home but somehow said it smelled like smoke. Sounds like an excuse for spying on the back porch camera. Won’t be staying here again due to privacy/safety concerns. I’ve stayed at a lot of airbnbs uuuover 8 years time and have never received any complaints as we are very respectful of people’s homes.

Stayed with kids","There were a few things that needed attention:
1. Lawn was not mowed when we arrived and it would have been nice that it was mowed to greet us.
2.outlet in Master bath doesn’t work. I had brought extension cords so we made it work.
3. We ate several meals in and found that the most of the under the counter lights didn’t work in the kitchen.
4. There were very few washcloths so I went and bought more. We now have extra at home
5. There are several spices to cook with in the kitchen! check expiration dates before buying more.
There is a small table with 4 chairs in the dining row . They provided an extra folding table with extra chairs so we could all eat around the table together. It is in the house ready for use.
6. The ice maker was not hooked up so buy/ bring ice.
7. Sprayer on kitchen sink watch out for…… you get a shower too while using it.
8. Most outlets have problems..
9. Main bathroom toilet seat needs fixed."

Stayed with a pet","The reason for loss of stars is the backyard was not secure for our dogs. The description was that it was dog friendly, it was not disclosed that the back yard is not fenced separately from the neighbors yard and a small alley way that goes towards a park was open entirely. The home was nice and cozy. Comfortable beds and easy check in. The kitchen was only moderately clean. The only potholder available was dirty and there was a dirty keurig cup in the coffee maker and none for us to use. There were no linens in the bathrooms, we had to search for the linen closet to stock the bathroom. We were disappointed with our stay."

Stayed with a pet","Super nice house with lots of room. There were only three of us, plus two German shepherds, but could easily accommodate more. Restaurants and outside mall type shopping just a few blocks away. Hosts were super responsive. Home is a little close to a busy road, but there’s a fenced yard out back, which is good for the pups. When we cleaned up after our dogs, pretty sure I also cleans up after someone else’s, but since there was snow on the ground, it might have been hard to see. Overall, great stay."

The kitchen space was perfect for the three of us. Very convenient for cooking your own meals. You’ll save a lot more by doing so. The bed rooms were right on. And bathroom space was ample.

Very steep & tall stairs up to the bedrooms become your Stair master gym 😉. Heater keeps you nice and toasty in the colder months ❄️. Off street parking available , yet still room for our two pick up trucks hauling trailers out front, that was definately a bonus . Unpaved road within the neighborhood, so watch for potholes. Would be a fun stay for a larger group 👍"

1 hour from Kemmerer.
Close to Rock Springs.
Local grocery store stays open till midnight.
BEAUTIFUL!
Spacious cabin, carpet upstairs, quiet backyard, with an empty back office space.
1.5 bathrooms.
4 bedrooms.
Large living room with an adorable wood burning stove.
In the middle of August, it was nice and cold in the house upon arrival!
A/C in the living room was a wonderful contribution to the whole house.
My significant other Cody had never been to W.Y. and it was a memorable stay. We traveled down the 530 hwy to visit the Flaming Gorge, we also made it to the 3 corners!
Private. Safe. Secluded. Stars are highly visible.

Disappointed we couldn't use the BBQ which was in need of a major clean and the interior stairs are really quite steep. On a positive the hot tub was very welcome (although not private) and the host David was very easy to communicate with.

Stayed a few nights","Our initial walk through when we arrived was nothing but “ooohs” and “ahhhhs”! The house clearly is capable of sleeping more than just the four of us.
The layout also included a separate room, desk, and stationary which was great for a few of us to sit down, connect to wifi, and get a little work done.
From a fully stocked kitchen, to very clean restrooms, to the common area, we all felt right at home. The clean and hot, hot tub was the icing on the cake after a long day of fishing at Flaming Gorge.
The BBQ setup worked seamlessly with our portable Traeger pellet grill. Cooking at night was enjoyable.
We brought a 24’ pontoon fishing boat which fit great in the driveway. Our Excursion fit with room right next to the boat.
We are already discussing another trip and will be booking this location.
We did not bring pets, but they are allowed. We could not tell that pets had even been inside, aside from the spare leash available in the entry way.
Bottom line. Book this!"

The 4th bedroom with the futon is a loft, not a totally enclosed room, but we didnt mind at all. It got a little cold upstairs but a space heater was provided so that was nice.
Two of the beds werent great ( they sloped inward) and several of us woke up the first morning with sore backs but we were able to fix that by putting the mattress on the floor and slept great!
The place is as pictured and we had a really enjoyable stay! I would definitely come back for a quick winter getaway with the family.
Thanks David!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was nice and comfortable. It was a very hot day and we were greeted by a cool air conditioned home. The house is located in a rural/suburban neighborhood between Green River and Rock Springs. The neighborhood is old with a mix of homes and mobile homes, but is quiet and we felt very safe.
Downstairs there is a very well appointed kitchen with modern appliances that are in good condition. The counter tops are old but while we were there a contractor stopped by to take measurements to replace them. The washer and dryer are very nice. The living room is large with a huge screen tv and several streaming services available. The furniture is newer and comfortable.
The living room is divided into two levels with 1 step between the levels. This turned out to be a problem for us. I accidently fell into the lower lever and hurt myself. This is a problem that should be addressed. A simple railing between the levels would make the rental much safer.
The upper level has 4 bedrooms, 2 of which are air conditioned. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable and connected to a full bath.
The back yard is lovely. Well landscaped, in good condition, and private. The hot tub is a great asset.
The owner was quite attentive and took care of the two minor issues we had very quickly. He appears to be committed to making this rental as pleasant and comfortable as he can."

Stayed with kids","We will start with the positives. The place is very spacious, it has parking right in front of the house. The dining room is nice and seats 6 at the table. The hot tub worked. The living room has a big tv which worked and the couch’s are comfortable. Wi-Fi worked entire stay as well. There is a washer and dryer. Unfortunately there were issues with my check in I was informed 5 mins before I was due to check in at 5 pm (which is already a late check in time) that the place was not cleaned. Understandably frustrating, he did offer to refund me a partial amount which I am waiting to be cleared by Airbnb. I did not check in until over an hour after that. You can tell cleaning was rushed there was sticky stuff on the counter, the stove had a lot of dust on it. There are spots in the house with a lot of dust and build up that seem to have been missed the last several cleanings. The house needs some updating but compared to anything else in this area it is a lot nicer. The stairs are extremely steep, my one year one ended up tumbling down them. (We live in a two story house and she normally slides down on her stomach) but because they were so steep she ended up catching her foot and flipping. These stairs may be an issue for elderly or babies. I do think it should be mentioned in the description that all bedrooms are upstairs and that the stairs are not normal stairs, there very well could be people who wouldn’t be able to make it up them and should be aware if that. The rooms upstairs do have a bit of a smell to them I’m guessing it’s the carpet, it’s tolerable but it’s there. & the lights above the hot tub are broken and hanging to low. I never want to hurt anyones business but it’s not in my nature to leave things out, I believe if these issues are fixed it would be a wonderful place to stay, but after my stay I wouldn’t personally stay here again."

Stayed one night","David was a great host and was able to help us make a last minute booking. His home is clean and provided all the necessities. The home is a bit dated and rustic, and could use some improvements since there are several open face closets/attics and exposed wood. Also be aware that all the bedrooms are upstairs which was difficult for us as we had a senior family member have some trouble getting up the steep stairs. Other than that it was a great stay and a comfortable place to spend a night on our drive west."

Shortly after arrival we heard shouting from neighbour house which worried me but we decided it was typical altercation either teen and parent. Not Melinda’s fault or under her control.

We didn’t have an opportunity to explore the neighborhood or town because we were only there for a brief period of time. However, it was the perfect spot to relax and unwind and sleep comfortably after a long day of travel.
We did take time on our way out after our stay to explore the Flaming Gorge Recreation Area which is not far from the home and a must see if you get the opportunity.
The owner is amazing! She is very responsive, cares about your comfort and needs, and is respectful of your privacy. We would definitely stay there again if our travels lead us to that area again."

It is a quaint little house that is full of character and they have it stocked with everything you need. Melinda was very communicative and was on top of all details that we needed as well as recommending a few places to grab a good bite to eat. Their place is comfortable and cozy and we would definitely stay again if we ever come through Rock Springs. It is exactly what an airbnb should be!

But later on at 2:20am it sounded like they was rearranging home furniture and I was unable to go back to sleep and need to be up at 5am. I know it was there home but i wonder what would have if it was me making noice waking theme up. So think twice before booking and read the whole ad because it’s a none refund booking but she refunded me back after I had to contact Airbnb and explain why I was canceling my booking.

It was thoughtful of her to have ground Starbucks coffee and 1/2 & 1/2 creamer in the kitchen ready for our use. The place was in a good neighborhood with quick access to the freeway and town. We enjoyed a nice walk in the neighborhood and felt very safe. We would definitely stay here again.

Stayed one night","Anna Marie's place was very clean, ready for us in time, very orderly, homey, and mostly very comfortable. We didn't really have the chance to walk the town but found a cool coffee house in an old train station. I might only comment that there were an excessive list of rules posted most everywhere in the unit. I really understand that in an older home, as well appointed as this one, a host wants people to be respectful. I just felt a bit worried that I might make a mistake and break a rule... which made for a more tense stay. I would recommend this place, understanding the above."

The owner has a list of “house rules” so make sure you read those throughly. The house is vintage 1930’s (I think) and she has decorated it with charm and comfort in mind. Comfortable beds, good TV and WiFi and quiet neighborhood. Nancy and Rick"

Anna Marie was very flexible as my schedule changed at the last minute too - greatly appreciated! Neighborhood is quiet despite being just two blocks from restaurants, coffee, the museum, and even a brewery. Solid stay."

The cottage is very intentional, clearly designed to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. It was easy to get to and easy to walk anywhere in the area. She is very thorough and mindful about COVID irrespective of the fact that the area itself seems a bit less cautious. We are stopping by again on our trip home. She is super communicative. Sweet sweet place. Well decorated, clean and restful. Thank you."

Stayed with kids","The cottage is so cute and charming. Anna is obviously a super talented designer and she responded very quickly to us and even accommodated a date change. The beds are comfy and my kids loved the adorable purple bath tub. Great option for couples or singles or people with older kids.
We gave it 4 stars overall because ultimately it wasn't a great fit for our family. We have 2 small children and the overly restrictive rules made it very hard to relax. Yes, we read them when we booked (I get why they did it but I was not a fan of the semi-condescending ""find the silly phrase"" game to be able book) but they are slightly different in wording when you get there and maybe we are overthinking it but those difference were meaningful in practice. ""The pillows and throws are not for personal use"" is not the same thing as ""you need to put them all in a closet away when you get there."" This begs the question as to why they are out to begin with? You are not allowed to eat or drink anything anywhere except in the kitchen which is one of the most bizarre rules I have ever encountered in an AirBNB. Again the listing made it seem like a suggestion and that only the bedrooms are off limits (which is reasonable) but when you get there they are stated such that the kitchen is the only place you can eat or drink. I wanted to have a tea and watch TV in the living room but realized I couldn't. We also had a very weird exchange around COVID that rubbed me the wrong way but rest assured the home was very very clean and we didn't encounter any people during the stay. Overall not a fit for us and we will not stay here again but I think it will be great for most people."

Stayed a few nights","The property is exactly as described in the ad. It was very clean and very-centrally located to Rock springs's commercial centers. Anne Marie was easy to deal with, and the made sure everything was in order for a smooth check-in process. I stayed at the property for three nights, and it was spacious and left you with peace-of-mind in terms of avoiding other people in this era of Covid-19. The bed was comfortable, and Anna Maria even provided towels, paper towels and some other touches that no all air bnb's provide. The only minor issue I had is it was tricky to control the thermostat setting, to make sure the air at night was neither too cold nor too warm. But that would probably be the case at any property in Wyoming in December, so I highly recommend this location."

Anna Marie’s attention to detail is impeccable, from the abundant seasonal decorations to the unusually high quality of the linens, towels, and other materials around the house. Oh, and plentiful, beautiful wooden toys for our four-year-old to play with. Everything about our stay was wonderful, and honestly I think we’d consider stopping in Rock Springs again just to stay here. Very highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","This was arguably the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. We were only here for one night, on our way home to Denver from a long road trip visiting family in Oregon. This felt like a high end boutique hotel in place like Portland, OR or somewhere. For one, it was the cleanest place I've ever been in, hands down. In the era of COVID-19, this was very reassuring. It felt like we were walking into someplace that had never been stayed in before. Even the toilet bowl felt brand new. For a one hundred year old cottage to feel this sparkling clean is truly a feat. I will also note how thoughtfully designed the whole place is. Every room, every corner has such a stylish and thoughtful touch to it. You could spend an hour or two just wandering through the home and admiring each unique aspect to Anna's decorating style. We loved the toys and books for the kids. The beds and bedding were extremely comfortable. The whole house was very easy to navigate thanks to all of Anna's notes. It's also just a great house and great space. I would've loved to live in this house in another life. While we didn't explore much of Rock Springs, this house is in a great spot to wander two blocks into the main downtown district. I wish we could've spent a longer time here and enjoyed a cup of wine on the front porch and watched the sun go down over the mountains. Not sure we'll ever make it back to Rock Springs, but if we do, we will definitely try to stay here."

Dish washer was broken no remotes to the tvs. Home Definitely need improvements writing on the walls to wore furniture. Lots of expired food left in pantry. Charcoal left un clean in bbq pit very bad visit at this home would not recommend staying here unless tripping hazards and home is upgraded. Only thing thats a rare find as described is its not up to airbnb standards.

When I told the host, she said the dishwasher had a sign on it saying”Do not use.” It did not. Even if it had, we should have been notified the dishwasher didn’t work. There were no hand towels in the bathrooms. There was broken glass on the back steps and the ground around them. The back yard does not have grass. The beds and bedrooms were comfortable and clean. The living room was a nice space to chat or watch tv. The host was amazing and responsive. She put a fan in the bedroom, at my request, so I could sleep peacefully. It could be a great place to stay, it just needs some attention."

We were part of a group of friends that was running the marathon in Green River. If you're staying here, check out the Wild Horse Loop that leaves from Green River. It's a nice drive, and you'll probably see wild horses!
Overall we had a blast, and Debra's place was a great home base!"

There were fresh amenities in the bathrooms, a few kcup pods (caffeinated and decaf!) snacks, dishwashing detergent, plenty of movies available through the large smart tv. The couch in the living room was amazingly comfortable, and the wall scrabble with a welcome message was a great personal touch.
The garage access was perfect for keeping our cars free from snow, and it was extremely convenient to enter/exit with the garage door remote.
Beth was incredibly responsive and supportive, I’d mailed a box of contacts ahead to the address, and when the mail didn’t go where I was expecting she contacted the post office to locate the contacts, and when they weren’t delivered on time she mailed them to my home address. Truly above and beyond host support.
I would encourage anyone remotely near Rock Springs to book this Airbnb, you will have a great stay."

Stayed about a week","Londa's home was hands down one of the best, and I felt like I was at home from the second I walked in. Check-in was super simple, the home was super clean, the beds were comfortable, and it was close to everything. I highly recommend staying in Londa's home if you are ever in Rock Springs, Wyoming!"

I was in Rock Springs for nearly 3 months and this was just what I needed. If you are looking for a place in Rock Springs to stay for one night or one hundred nights - this is it!"

Grocery store is just down the street and Walmart not to far if you need groceries etc"

Stayed over a week","Londa is the best host we have ever known on Air bnb. The house was immaculate (very clean) and Londa was very responsive to all of our needs. We highly recommend. My sister and I stayed for two weeks and have no complaints. We were surprised to find there are many things to do in Rock Springs, Wyoming. The scenery is beautiful and the people are so friendly and kind. If you don’t mind driving a little bit, this is the perfect place to visit Yellowstone, Utah, Montana, Idaho (all within driving distance). What a beautiful country we have!!! Thank you Londa and hope to be back someday."

I also appreciated the dog blanket spread, even though I brought my own, it was nice for extra coverage! Parking right by entry steps was very convenient, too."

Stayed with a pet",Such a cute home and a great place to rest on our long drive with our dogs. The home is tucked off the street behind another home so was slightly challenging to find in the dark but Vanessa provided excellent instructions and was very responsive. We especially appreciated the blanket for our little dogs to use.
