Water bottles in fridge , suggestions to eating places and things to do. The last morning bakery items were left at the door from these amazing hosts. Attention to details was evident in the condo. We will definitely return if in the area again."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I were extremely comfortable during our stay at this Airbnb and deeply appreciated all the thoughtful details the hosts provided for us, including earplugs, board games, plenty of blankets, a wireless charger, and more. The pan dulce was a sweet surprise on the day of our checkout, and we will definitely return. They also recommended local events and restaurants and were very responsive. I highly recommend this place if you're planning a trip to BTX! 🌴"

Stayed with kids","I picked this air b&b after reading all of the great reviews commenting on how clean it was & it did not disappoint. Communication was great before, during, & after our stay. Check in was easy, the condo is in a safe & pretty area (& gated), was nice & cool when we arrived, it was clean & nicely decorated, & some drinks & snacks were provided. There was some noise from the road & upstairs condo but earplugs & white noise machine were thoughtfully available (but not necessary). Plenty of linens & hot water + nice bath products provided. My husband said it was the nicest air b&b that we’ve stayed at & that was before our host left us some fresh pan dulce one morning. Our stay really added to our enjoyment of our vacation. Thank you so much!"

It is about 45 minutes to drive to birding centre on South Padre Island. It is only 15 minutes to Resaca de la Palma State Park and Palo Alto Battlefields NHP. Shopping and groceries minutes away. Large Mall 5 minute walk from condo. Condo was quiet and restful. Everything works. Note: pool now requires a key to enter. Thanks to hosts Veronica and Jaime for your suggestions and clear directions .

The nice little touches like plenty of blankets no buffering high quality wifi as well as smart tv’s, fans in every room and comfortable bedroom mattress were a big plus!

Stayed over a week","NOT ENOUGH STARS IN THE SKY to accurately convey how absolutely perfect Veronica and Jamie's place was! I am a traveling medical professional and they were so understanding and flexible with my need to repeatedly alter my reservation due to work. The condo was beautifully furnished, ultra comfortable and a phenomenal value. I was so at ease I was completely content to spend my days vegged out on the couch with the many streaming services available. The love is tangible in the many small thoughtful touches throughout the condo (I won't spoil it, you'll know them when you see them). If you are reading this review look no further than Veronica and Jamie's place. If I am ever back in Brownsville I would stay here, even if offered free housing elsewhere. SUPER DUPER HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"

The bedroom lock is a little wonky. It has to ""wake up"" before the code actually works. Just wait 30 seconds and put the code in again.
When the sun rises the room gets bright. I liked that but others might be bothered. Large dog that occasionally barks, but kept outside during my stay and didnt bother me."

Luckily it was lovely outside & I was able to open a window to enjoy the fresh air. I think most people would be fine with the room temperature. My boyfriend was. You might want to bring your own coffee maker or plan to go out for coffee. There was a huge tv in the living room which we had access to, but never used. It wasn’t used by anyone during our 2 night visit."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a little gem. It is well price for the space. I also like that it is accessible from 2 main roads (Central Blvd. and Boca Chica). I was happy that he allows you to park in the driveway and clearly states which side to park on. I think having nails makes it hard ro work with lockboxes, which he has on the front gate. There is a keypad on the front door. And the 2nd key from the ring in the lockbox is for the actual bedroom door
We for the hang of it after coming and going multiple times each day. Lol. The general area was a bit stuffy, but the bedroom was not. The room itself is, as the title suggests, cozy. It has simple, but nice decor. I loved the huge tv. The bed was comfy (although a bit low to the ground for my 6'1"" hubby). There is a shared restroom but we had it to ourselves during our stay. Jose is a very nice, respectful person. He quickly responded to my messages and quickly got to my request. His dog would bark and then stop. I would definitely return!"

I will definitely come back and recommend this place."

We had to clean the sliding door of spider webs, the pool and had to put the trash cans out for pick up as they were full already. There was lots of ants and mosquitos but that’s understandable with all the surrounding water, but bug spray was available in the home. Overall the home is beautiful and spacious and the location was great. Definitely recommend!"

Also Maya was very helpful and responsive with questions about amenities at house, internet access and even kindly let us have a late check out when our flight was delayed due to weather. My favorite part of the stay was the beautiful patio full of birds, the pool and peaceful views of the channel. I would most certainly stay again at this location if I were in the area. My only note for visitors is drinking water quality in Brownsville, has nothing to do with the house. Water out of the faucet is not good. Stock up on a few bottles and refill at one of the many stand alone filling stations close by."

The home was beautiful, clean and spacious for our large family. The back patio was a great gathering space and we wish we could have tried the pool but maybe we will have to come back for that! 😄 We were kind of nervous for doing a large rental but we decided to give it a shot and we could not be more happy with our decision. Thank you Maya for an amazing stay and for being gracious and hospitable with us. We will definitely be back! Rent Maya's property! You will not be sorry!"

We also loved the game room and it was a big hit for kids and adults alike. The pool was plenty big and was a great way to end every night.

When we arrived we couldn’t get in because the code didn’t work, which Mich confirmed was because the smart lock was broken and in need of repairs, but the hosts were thoughtful and had a lock containing the key in the mailbox just in case, which Mich gave us the code for less than a minute after we informed them about the issue. Brittany is a great host as well, she was very friendly and gave clear instructions. The townhouse itself is clean￼, practical, peaceful and has a beautiful view of the lake, plants, and birds. We also enjoyed feeding the ducks in the backyard. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will likely come back if we can."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was amazing! The house was very clean and very comfortable and has most of everything that you could need! If you plan on cooking you might wanna bring some additional pans and pots if needed but they do have one of each in the kitchen as well as utensils, cups, plates and bowls. So still very well stocked and convenient! The surrounding was so peaceful and has a very nice view and for being close to others we only saw the neighbors once so it’s decently private as well! The only issue we had was with WiFi going in and out occasionally and certain streaming services wouldn’t work, we reset the router but it would happen on and off after, but I’m sure that’s an easy fix! Overall the stay was great and we highly recommend this to anyone visiting the Brownsville area! It was only 2 of us on our stay but there’s Plenty of beds and restrooms for a family if needed! Thank you guys so much and we will definitely come back if we find ourselves needing something again!"

I stayed with my husband, twin daughters and two coworkers to attend an event. Be aware that the area with the bunk beds is not its own private bedroom, but a loft open area. It ended up being ok for us, but for those looking for three distinct rooms, it may be an issue. The hosts response time was always within minutes, which was really nice! We had a great weekend!"

Stayed with kids","This house is AMAZING. We really enjoyed our stay at Brownsville in this clean, spacious and modern house. The lake view is even better in person than in the pictures and also something extra is a Pin Pon Table that is upstairs. Also, the same day of our arrival the main shower bedroom was changed for one completely new and I think that little detail was great. Excelent communication all the time with Brittany, she resolved all our doubts very quick.
We really hope to come back again to this place in our next trip to Brownsville as we really enjoyed our time here.
Thanks for everything!"

Cozy doesn't even begin to cover it. Think plush blankets, comfy pillows, and a general sense of snugness that'll make you never want to leave.
But wait, it gets better. The host left out a spread of FREE goodies - fresh pastries, top-notch shampoo, and soap that smells like a spa. Talk about above and beyond!

The bed was comfortable and I appreciated all of the thoughtful touches. I enjoyed sitting out on the porch as well. The location was conveniently walkable to downtown and, if I had more time on this trip, would have loved to walk to the zoo, which was very nearby. This will be my go-to place for future work travel in this area."

We could tell he values being a great host. My partner went on and on about how it was the best Airbnb he’s been in. If you’re deciding between this Airbnb and another - choose this one. You will thank yourself"

First, the place is beautifully decorated — it felt so homey and modern, while conserving some of the historical aspects of the home. The house was pretty clean, too. The bed was so comfy! It felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.
This house is located in downtown. I was visiting when Charro Days was taking place and it was walking distance to the main festival, as well as to good restaurants and bars.
The best part of staying at Danny's place was Danny. He was communicative, honest, helpful, and responsive. I'm glad I stayed here and I plan on staying at Danny's place whenever I'm back in Brownsville."

Stayed a few nights","This Tiny Home was a minimalistic dream for me.
It was so cute, cozy and comfortable! There had been several reviews in the past stating about noise complaints such as roosters and neighbors.
No roosters during my stay but you did have neighbors playing music every once in a while but growing up in the valley, that was normal for me and I knew how to drown it out. It was during the day though, not at night.
The bed was extremely comfortable!
I appreciated the fans and multiple blankets.
The house had everything you could possibly want.
The organic coffee was delicious.
And I loved soaking in the vitamin D from the back porch.
Close to a lot of good eateries, museums and entertainment.
Danny went above and beyond with communications when I had some concerns.
I can't wait to stay here again one day!
Oh! Joy Division posters were amazing!

Stayed a few nights","Interesting little house and area that provided a much more local experience compared to a typical hotel stay. It was my first time visiting Brownsville, where they have a rich Mexican-Texan history. I felt as if I was somewhere between Mexico and the United States. I love experiencing different cultures and communities so these were all on the plus side. My favorite part of the house was the kitchen as we love to make our own meals even while on the road. It’s a small house so it has a small but capable kitchen that made cooking a fun balancing act.The kitchen and home had plenty of what we needed and not too much of what we didn’t. Sitting on the back porch was the place to enjoy your meal or to just enjoy a cup of coffee. I would definitely book again should my travels take me once again to the very unique Texas city of Brownsville."

Love how the bedroom had glass double doors that separate the kitchen and living room, the bed is very very comfortable, and the bathroom comes with a bidet. It's details of this stay down to the surfing and travel magazines and books, retro fridge and kitchen, and the porch in the back with the leather bound chairs that made it amazing. The outdoor shower is a lovely touch as well. Thank you for your accomodation Danny, we loved the organic coffee as well. If we are in the area again we will definitely book this stay again!"

Thank you so much for making my partner and I feel at home. The house was cozy, beautiful, clean, and it made us feel right at home. We certainly made our way to two of your recommended restaurants downtown. The food was excellent. We certainly appreciated the decor. Also, let your staff (if applicable) a big Thank You. We will be back!

Stayed one night","The house was very nice, but the location was terrible. Abandoned houses surrounding and a very low income area. The neighbor played very loud music until very late in the evening. A rooster crowed very loud starting at 2:20 in the morning and did that all night and I could not sleep. I was also very worried about the safety of my car as it was not secure and it is in a very bad area. I feel bad writing this review as I can tell the owner puts a lot of effort into their property, but I need to be honest."

The only thing is that we did not know how to get to the pool, of course we did not ask because it was not urgent and it was not a priority but next time we hope to know where it is because we would definitely stay again.

The kitchen is 100% equipped. The sofa in the living room deserves a special mention, it is extremely comfortable and practical. There was hot weather during our stay, but it was no problem as Jorge's unit has ceiling fans and air conditioning. It also has two desks to work with. The casita is located in the Country Club, so the back of the house is inside the complex, so it is surrounded by the garden and even steps you will have the lake, a view that you can enjoy from the benches that are leaving the casita....In short, this accommodation is recommended and
with the plus of having received good attention from Jorge....Thank you !!!"

Unbeatable location, in the middle of dozens of restaurants and shops; next to the hangover, where we could admire the local wildlife. La Casita is super comfortable and complete, as well as beautiful. Everything is new and clean. The bed is super comfortable; the kitchen has toooodo everything you need to prepare food (and even coffee and sugar to start the day!), very good size of a cupboard and washer/dryer working really well. The dining room is a very comfortable space to spend some time watching movies on the super screen. We missed spending some time on the terrace, which is super comfortable for a family reunion. We had a fabulous stay.
We will definitely be back again. Thank you very much Jorge."

Stayed over a week","We were looking for a quiet economic place since we get up early and return late after birding all day. And this place turned out to be perfect.
In a quiet neighborhood with the backyard on the edge of a golf course. We enjoyed our peaceful quiet nights. No street noise.
Parking was close and right in front of the house in what we would call a secure neighborhood
We liked the location for travels in different locations instead of moving between several rentals
Great local Mexican food was nearby (Tacos Puentes Viejo, our fav open till 10pm) as were grocery stores
We enjoyed the birds in the backyard from water birds to parrots and even a green jay.
The place was clean with a full kitchen and washer dryer and large TV. And many amenities left from previous guests.
Large bed has a memory foam mattress which we are familiar with but some people may find different than a conventional mattress.
Jorge responded promptly to any questions we had
Loved the special cookies he provided
We will stay there again since we enjoyed our first visit to this part of Texas"

Stayed over a week","La Casita is the perfect place to stay in Brownsville. It has everything you need for either a short or long stay. I stayed at La Casita for two months while working at UTHealth School of Public Health. La Casita is only about 10 minutes to Linear Park where the Brownsville Farmer’s Market takes place every Saturday at 9am, about 10 minutes to the zoo, about 40 minutes to South Padre, about 5 minutes from the mall, about 10 minutes to the 77 Flea Market held every weekend, and about 10 minutes to UTRGV campus. For those staying a longer time, there are free exercise classes (provided by Tu Salud Si Cuenta) that take place at various locations throughout the area. Classes include Zumba, boot camp, swimming, yoga and more. Jorge was an excellent host, very friendly and responded quickly to anything that came up during my stay. The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and the neighbors friendly, making for a peaceful stay. I would definitely stay here again in the future. I really enjoyed my stay in Brownsville thanks to Jorge and my stay at La Casita."

The house was always perfectly cool and fresh. The kitchen is beautiful and there was everything needed to make meals for my family. It was only about a 45 minute drive to south padre island!

Stayed with kids",Juan and Annie are wonderful host. The home is large and spacious. Comfortably can fit a large family and everyone have there own space. 2.5 baths were great. The home itself is so clean and comfortable. AC system works great for them summer days. The pool was such a great amenity to have and we took advantaged daily. The beds are not the best so if you need something super comfortable perhaps consider bringing a air mattress. Lots of towels which was nice. Washer and dryer are brand new. Had several complementary goodies. All in all if you are visiting with a large family this is the place to go!
