Stayed one night","This is my second time staying at one of Live’s places. I really liked this apartment. It was very clean, free parking, gorgeous living space, and the host was very accommodating. If you’re in the Harrisburg area, definitely consider staying here. He takes a lot of pride in his rentals and it definitely shows."

The space was very comfortable and everything you could need was already there. The host was super responsive to any questions. I’d definitely stay here again for work or leisure.

Stayed one night","Live’s home was BEAUTIFUL. The pictures did not do it justice. I will say parking was a hassle being in a larger vehicle than what the parking lot could accommodate, but friendly neighbors came out of their way to assist. I think this home would benefit from added security on the front door I.e, a camera or inside deadbolt since it is right on a busy street. Waterfall shower was a huge plus after a long day of travel! We enjoyed our stay in Harrisburg!"

Stayed one night","Pros: The apartment was extremely clean and neat. The bed was comfortable. The shower was excellent. It has a very nice heating and cooling system that works great. The tvs are very nice. Cons: The first one: we got woke up about 2:30am as someone was opening a door and walking on the floor above us. It sounded like they were walking on popcorn as the floors up there must be very old. The second one is small, but there is only a old style electric percolator type coffee maker there. It’d be much easier and convenient to have a Keurig style coffee maker there. We did take advantage of the tea there till we got got coffee later. All in all a very nice place to stay !!"

Stayed a few nights","It was by far one of the best places I’ve stayed at. Super clean, comfortable and perfect view of riverfront and can walk right up and down it as you please and not have to move your car at all to go to near by restaurants either.
If you are bothered by the homeless population in the area, it may not be the place for you though it’s not heavily populated but you will see it. An outreach program was out serving the population across the street by providing meals and it was lovely to see it be done in the city.
The apartment had everything needed minus oven cookware. That’s something that can be gotten and needed for others to enjoy while they stay for an easy meal. However, no biggie.
It was really a pleasant stay and bed was very comfortable as well as living rm area. It really catered to my needs during my stay for a conference."

The photos helped with check in instructions. It was our first stay in Harrisburg. The locals were friendly and welcoming. We will stay again when we travel. It was a perfect half way to home for a night’s stay. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the best Airbnb's that my boyfriend and I have stayed in. Clean and spacious. We loved the shower and the king sized bed. We had a concert in town and to come home from a long night at the concert and just lay in the comfy bed was amazing. There is a lot of traffic on the road in front of the house but that didn't bother us at all. Just an overall amazing experience, we will definitely be back."

My stay truly went too fast and I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy those cozy little getaway! And it felt safe going for a late night walk into downtown, the perfect location if you’re visiting Harrisburg! Thank you for such lovely accommodations!"

Stayed a few nights","The apt was just like the pictures! So much attention to detail went into the decor. It was clean, comfortable and lacked nothing! HOWEVER, I ended up in that beautiful shower with the rain showerhead, all lathered up in fine body wash and the water turned cold with no way to rinse off the soap! I was Mortified! I contacted the Host, Live via text to let him know about my experience. He read my text and never responded! Can you say ""INSULT TO INJURY!"" This was a Horrible ending to such a wonderful short stay! He showed me No empathy or concern. He did not acknowledge how awful that was for me. No apology, NOTHING!! The footsteps of the people that were in the apt above me, not a problem. They even had a party for St. Patty's Day with music, loud conversation and walking back and forth till 2am, I didn't even mention it. But the cold shower took my experience from a 5 star rating to a 2! I was so disappointed! So if you Love COLD showers and Cold hosts, this is the place for you!"

Bedroom was great for sleeping as there are no windows. Bed was comfy.
No tv (as mentioned in the listing).
Great Wifi.
You are in the basement so you do hear people above, but not loud.
Walkway to entry would be tricky to anyone with a disability as it downhill and paving stones.
Shower was delightful!
Kitchen also has a furnace, water heater and sump pump in it. Very clean, just wanted to mention it.
Thanks for a relaxing stay!"

1. please let people now that it is one level in the house you live in. Not a complete house.
2. The heater every time it turned on, it would make a loud noise.
3. The path going to the back of the house was very slippery in the winter.
4. Since it is the lower floor, you can hear every step they take upstairs."

Stayed with kids","The best stay we’ve had on Airbnb. The place was spotlessly clean, no dust or any feeling of it. The neighborhood was very lovely, very safe. You can walk around on the sidewalk and there’s a big (soccer/ baseball) field not too far away. Nice to see people playing sport there. Neil and Tone were super helpful and friendly. My little four-year-old loves their goat, Billy. With a goat, some bushes of home-grown vegetable here and there, and a far sight looking down the hill behind the house, the view from the apartment was very relaxing."

The hosts left us things for a morning guest that was very handy and nice. There was even gluten-free coralplex! The bed was very comfy, and the air conditioning was nice. Parking was also not a problem at all, and the neighborhood was very pleasant and welcoming. The real attraction of the place was the little goat they grow- Billy. You don't hear it too much but he greeted us every morning with licks and kisses. It was really cute!
We would definitely love to stay again! Amazing house owners Charming apartment and of course Billy (:"

Stayed with kids","Conveniently located just off the highway. Neighborhood felt extremely safe. Neil and Tone live upstairs and so are right there if there are any problems (which there wasn’t). Everything was clean and set up for us. They had even set up a small bed for our daughter. And some breakfast stuff for the morning. There is an inside door to their house that you aren’t able to lock from your side and a set of double doors that goes into a large dark garage or something that you can’t lock. It would feel a bit more secure if you had the ability to lock those doors. I wasn’t worried because of all the positive reviews and them being super hosts, but thought any single women might want to know about it beforehand, I wouldn’t have wanted that surprise. All in all we had a great stay."

Stayed one night","Neil and Tone’s place was good for a quick overnight on our drive through Pennsylvania. It is not far from the I-81 and easy to find in a quiet, safe neighborhood. We received really clear check in instructions and also quick answers to our questions. There is a full size kitchen as well as laundry facilities - both are always appreciated by us when we’re on the road. The bed was comfortable and there were extra blankets and pillows handy. As mentioned by others (and in the ad), there is no TV but good Wi-Fi allowed us to easily stream on our computer, and there is no window in the bedroom. The place is no frills, and I probably wouldn’t choose it if I were going to be spending several days, but it was what we needed for the night, and it was definitely a good value."

Stayed with a pet","We showed up to what was a very bad part of town, there were empty alcohol bottles and trash all over ground at entry way. The inside had doors falling off hinges, dirt and trash all over the floors and furniture. The bedding was not changed, there’s was dirt and hairs under the comforters on the sheets. No toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, towels, or ANYTHING. When I complained the host told me he was not going to believe the filth in the photos I sent, to leave the premises and take the refund but not to “lie” about the cleanliness. Horrible experience. We were eight hours from home without a place to stay for a week. The host said he was going to “believe the cleaners over the photos”. Terrible. The doors did not seal, it was just dirty and scary atmosphere. Air bnb was wonderful about getting us our money back and into a new space. Thank goodness!"

There were a few items left unclean which made us question the cleanliness overall and a stale musty odor throughout. Owner was quick to respond and offered to have cleaner return but we declined as we had a very busy schedule and felt more comfortable doing a surface cleaning ourselves at that point. Very noisy area, window and doors not well insulated so heard all of the city noises. Overall stay was good although price was high for what our experience was in the end."

The negative is that the temperature appears to be controlled by the main house. The thermostat in the room doesn't do anything. I woke up in the middle of the night and it was 75 in the room. I had to open the windows wide open to cool the room down so I could sleep. It was in the low 20s outside. They do provide a fan which also helped. I probably would not choose this place if you like to sleep on the cool side."

He does mention in his listing to leverage your expectations thats it’s not a 5 star rating, but I was thoroughly impressed. It worked for us as we were only staying one night. Lamont was also very responsive. If you need anything just reach out to him. If I’m up that way for a tournament again I’ll definitely lodge there again."

Glad to see a bathtub, but alas no stopper.
Bed sheets are polyester. Yuck, but whatever. But shocked to find no mattress pad,just bare mattress under a very thin bottom sheet. I was creeped out contemplating the various peoples' sweat and other.......and having no washable barrier between the mattress and the sheet.
Clock on the wall: no battery.
Coffee area: 1 keurig-type coffee and lots of Splenda, no sugar.
Odd that the dorm sized refrigerator opens to the wall. Hinge can easily be switched to make it more convenient.
I just didn't feel the love.
It was a place to crash.
I wouldn't go back."

Only thing that was odd was the parking arrangement. You have to park on the street even though there is a large driveway, although i was able to pull car up to unload and unload, I felt a bit uncomfortable parking on the street.
Overall a nice place and quiet neighborhood close to where I was working."

Lamont was great at responding to any questions I had. I'd certainly stay here again next time I'm in the area."

Stayed one night","Great overall experience, at a great price, with a couple of things worth noting.
If you are staying in the room at the side of the house, you have to park on the side of the road. I can't understand why, when there is room for plenty of vehicles. I don't like parking on the side of the road.
The cleaning fee was sufficient for the cleaning to be a bit more thorough. The ceiling fan had quite a build up of dust, which should have been easily seen by the cleaning person."

The neighborhoods crossed to get there are underprivileged but once you arrive, it's correct and calm.
The feedback with Lamont is not very optimal.
I would not receive a friend like this but for 1 night, at this price, once a few small work is done, the accommodation is good"

For a quick stop just to sleep and get back on the road was our reason for staying. you can not beat the price for a stay. Huge TV to unwind. small kitchenette area with coffee and microwave and mini fridge. I would stay again if needed but not for long term as the bed tends to slope to the right and I roll to the middle. Its a king size bed I believe so that helped with room. Overall best bang for your buck!!

It was very clean and thoughtfully decorated, no clutter. While we didn’t use the balcony area because it was Dec, I could tell it would be fun to hangout there.
An additional nice touch was providing locally sourced product like coffee from Lil Amps and wine from SpringGate winery. And of course Hershey candies!
Adam was very responsive to any questions we had along the way. A prospective renter should be comfortable with stairs. Once you are in the apartment you are well rewarded."

The location was overall very nice however, not too much to do in Harrisburg itself, its a slower city. However, we were able to walk to the downtown capital area and explore, it was all 20-30 minutes away. It is very close to the water so we were able to do a sunset walk which was great. The apartment is a great size and the balcony is a plus. Off street Parking was also a benefit. Would recommend others to stay here, and we would stay here again if visiting for Hershey. Adam was very responsive and sent detailed instructions."

Stayed with kids","Family of four, including a pre-teen and teen, loved this place! Absolutely everything we could possibly need was included at this adorable apartment right down to creamer for my coffee. This completely furnished gem made our travels so much easier! Full kitchen, towels and linens, in-unit laundry, games, toiletries - the list goes on.
We chose Harrisburg for its central location to places we were visiting in PA - Gettysburg, Hershey, and Philadelphia. The apartment was in a convenient location for getting in and out to highways, yet set in a quiet, safe neighborhood with great food and walkable to downtown Harrisburg.
Host Adam was so great from the beginning, even before we arrived. I asked for advice on our travel plans and his guidance was useful and right on. His communication and instructions for arrival were thorough and continuous during our entire stay.
We loved everything about our stay and I’m confident anyone would love staying here."

The perk of the stay was the balcony - watching the sun set over the skyline was fantastic. And the entire place was so clean and nicely furnished. The location was central to all of our planned activities and the notes from Adam on 'things to do' led us to the greatest little restaurants in the area. I highly recommend checking Adam's place out for any stays you may plan in the area of Harrisburg, PA."

The place was spotless and well appointed with the necessities. The beds were firm, but we thought they were very comfortable. We liked having two different televisions and access to the washer/dryer. Adam gave us some great local food recommendations. We enjoyed walking through the city and along the waterfront trail, and visiting Hershey Park. Parking was never a problem, and we felt very safe in our surroundings. The three flights of stairs may be an issue for some, bur was not an issue for us. We loved the cute little deck overlooking the street as well. We would definitely stay in this location again!"

Stayed a few nights","My two teenage sons, husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Adam’s apartment. The place was exactly as pictured and fantastically clean (very important to me). 30-minute drive to Hershey, which is where we needed to be. The bedrooms are as described and someone could also sleep on the sofa outside, if they wanted. Linens were great; my husband LOVED the foam memory mattress on our bed. We didn’t cook — it was a short stay — but from what I saw, there were enough cooking supplies and equipment to handle that if needed. Great internet.
Our stay was in December, but we would have loved sitting out on the balcony if the weather had been warmer (we did step out and explore it).
Adam is the best part of this rental. He’s super responsive and extremely helpful. He answered all of my questions almost immediately over chat. He had great recommendations for food and checked in that we were doing ok. My sons want me to figure out another reason for us to visit again
Stay here!"

Jon said the you two texted and he let you know about a couple of minor tweaks that he thought you should make (shampoo dispenser, etc). We just talked, he thought you place was wonderful.

Stayed one night",Perfect little spot for our quick trip to Harrisburg. We came into town to see a band and Ben’s place was conveniently located within walking distance of the venue/restaurants. Check in was easy and the space was super clean and comfortable. We also loved the view of the Capitol building :) we’ll be back!

Enjoyed the downtown location across from the capitol. Walkable to good restaurants and pubs. Just a few blocks to the river and the island and a great river walking/biking trail where I went running.
I was a little nervous ahead of time about the street parking but it was not a problem at all. If I'm back in Harrisburg again anytime soon, I'd happily stay at Ben's place."

Stayed a few nights","Everything was as described. The free parking is on Commonwealth Way, the employee parking signs where we parked were free and we did not get towed.
The only troublesome thing was the two eye burners that would overheat if using both eyes, so used only one. There were instructions on how to use the burners. It seems to constantly need to be unlocked. There wasn't a broom and dustpan so you may want to bring a little hand one in case you spill something and the knob in the cabinet kept coming off.
None of the issues above warranted a drop in rating. Overall this place was perfect in location, size, and amenities. Everything was perfect, thus, five stars.
My sister and I enjoyed our stay and would certainly visit again if the need arose. Thanks, Ben."

There is traffic noise but the fan helps keep the level down. Monday - Friday you will get louder early morning traffic noise. Needs an extra blanket for the comfy bed. The kitchen is small with only few pots and pans if you plan to cook. Would definitely stay there again for a few days.

Everything from check-in to parking information was detailed and simple to follow. Having a workspace, comfortable bed, and kitchenette to do some cooking was exactly what we were looking for and at a reasonable price. We stayed for several nights and really enjoyed it. Would definitely stay here again!"

I stumbled upon this amazing place just looking for a place to stay while I had a state meeting/weekend trip with my boyfriend. We were so close (walking) distance to “restaurant row” or second street.
If you are punk rock/metal/emo fans please do yourself a favor and find your way to JB Lovedrafts and order the chili with grilled cheese. Every place we ate at was amazing, we took an eating break and walked around the water. I never thought I’d go back to Harrisburg for just a fun weekend trip, but we are definitely planning that and it’s because of this location! Ben was great, very responsive and the apartment is so cute. I love it. Book here"

But this has something else that makes it stand out - a fabulous host that really stocks the place like no other! Nice selection in the bar area.. Additionally, LIndsay went out of her way to provide us vegan food especially for us - tons of items! I've never had a hostess go to such efforts. Both beds are super soft and comfy, and she also paid attention to our chemical sensitivities with the linens, which was much appreciated. It was the kind of home that truly felt like home, right from the moment we arrived. Easy walk to the water and its nice walking path, with Little Amps coffee on the way (yummy butterfly pea coffee) and do not miss Millworks! Best brewery/art gallery I've seen. We would love to return."

Stayed about a week","Linday's place felt like home the minute we arrived. Designated parking was a real plus! and it wasn't far from the front door. What really impressed us was the cleanliness overall, the very well stocked kitchen (pots and pans, blender, dishes) as well as breakfast foods, milk, half and half ! coffee, teas and spices! We loved the two queen size beds and large closets with lots of hangers! The large bathroom was easy to share with my sister. Linday's place was a perfect place for two sisters from far away, to visit our sister living in Harrisburg. We highly recommend this rental and plan on booking it the next time we come to visit our sister again."

We appreciated the extra snacks, drinks and staples left for our use. Even though this property is a row house, the neighborhood was relatively quiet. Assigned parking around the corner was safe and was definitely a plus.

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at Lindsay's place in Harrisburg. We were visiting for a trip to Hershey Park, and the house was far enough away to have a good break in our day. The check-in was easy, and the place was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with everything that may be needed for our short trip from almond milk, Nutella, and breakfast basics. The coffee was past the best before date, but that gave us a chance to explore the area. The Broad Street Market is very nice walk from the house and has everything!
The living room had a variety of alcohol stocked and mixers in the fridge. The bed was very comfortable and we slept peacefully. The back patio was a nice place to sit and have tea. It was surprisingly quiet.
We wanted to take the 🚲s out, but one had a flat. Lindsay did her best to remedy this by guiding us to other bikes available. Because of this, Lindsay made the other bikes available to us for later. We will definitely again. Thank you!"

Having an assigned parking space was really nice and a relief since you don’t have to spend time looking for a spot or worrying about street cleaning schedules and where you can/can’t park. Lastly, there were some nice touches like providing a bed and bowls for pets, everything you need for a continental breakfast and some drinks both of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic kind."

The inside is tastefully decorated, and there are thoughtful little touches everywhere that we really appreciated. The kitchen is fully stocked - we really appreciated the kcups and creamer and the snacks available to us after a 2 hour drive!

Stayed one night","Wonderful place in Harrisburg! True city living in walking distance to many things. But with a reserved parking place, you can come and go and never have to worry about parking! The home is wonderfully decorated and the beds are soooo comfortable. The air conditioning and white noise machine made for a great nights sleep. The complementary snacks, beverages and stuff for breakfast were greatly appreciated. If we had known how wonderful this place was, we honestly would have changed our plans to stay a second night! ❤️
Details you may want to know- the steps are steep, so not ideal for mobility challenged (both bedrooms and bathroom are upstairs). Also, since they ask you take off your shoes upon entering, don’t run down the steps in your socks! (Trust me it doesn’t end well!) The parking lot is diagonally across from the house, on a different street. Most of the streets are one way and narrow, so if you miss it you’ll have to go several blocks around to take another stab at finding it. The steps and parking aren’t problems at all for most folks, but had I been traveling with elderly folks or tiny kids it might have been.
Truly a gem of a place near great food and about 20 minutes from the airport."

Stayed about a week","I stayed here for a week and enjoyed it very much. On-site laundry was useful and the unit was well-furnished and clean. Close to 3rd street attractions and restaurants, and not too far from downtown and the capitol. Off-street parking is wonderful to have in this town and hard to come by. Only minor complaints are the noise from the busy intersection nearby and sometimes hearing the upstairs tenant walking around, but things are usually quiet past 10pm. Wish the front door window had some kind of covering at night since anyone walking by could see right in and the street lights shine in and make it harder to sleep. I stuffed a couple hand towels along the top of the door as a remedy."

2.) Our car got sprayed with something sticky on our 2nd day there, I’m unsure if it was the city’s doing or the upstairs neighbor since they departed that night.
3.) There is a spider problem, Multiple spiders were found outside and they were HUGE. They made a web in-front of the door which we walked face first into.
Overall I would stay here again."

There was a binder of information in the unit with slightly different instructions for check out than the Airbnb instructions so that was a little confusing.
There were no spare pillows or blankets so I had to use a throw pillow to support my neck.
Not in Erica’s control: the driveway had a large truck next to it which was hard to see around when pulling out of the driveway so be ready for that if you stay here."

The listing and photographs accurately matched the property. The unit was very clean. Self check-in was fast and easy. The internet wifi was strong and reliable. We parked on the street about a block away. We walked about 15 minutes to reach the capitol and center city, and the nearby river walk was a pleasant stroll.
Just a few small things to keep in mind: the neighborhood seemed plenty safe, but groceries (aside from a gas station convenience store) aren't nearby -- so bring along with you whatever sustenance you plan to consume. Also (and as the listing accurately depicts), there are a couple of dinette chairs but no sofa in the living space. Finally, the bed lacked a box spring and therefore felt a little squishy."

Stayed a few nights","What can’t I say about this stay?! We traveled for a much needed girls trip away with our daughters for 21st birthday celebrations. We felt like we were somewhere we could enjoy staying forever. Brian & Karen thought of absolutely everything we could possibly need and then some! There were games in the apartment which ended up being a plus when we had an unexpected rainy evening. The communication was top notch too! Everything from making us feel welcome to letting us in on little “need to knows”, were included. The property was absolutely gorgeous and a beautiful place to stay!

The pool was also huge and we really enjoyed the hot tub. I will for sure come back :)

Stayed with kids","Where do I begin? This villa was a cozy, heavenly nook in the middle of a warm blue sky. The pictures on the listing don’t do this place any justice. Specially when it comes to the pool and hot tub. The pool and hot tub are in a huge paradise like area surrounded by gorgeous plants, palm trees and a spectacular glass wall with an amazing view. It’s equipped with all your entertainment needs and accessories. Loaded with floaties for the kids, blue tooth for mom and tables/chairs for everyone. The villa itself is very intimate and welcoming. I am a single mom of 13 yr old twins and we all truly enjoyed our stay. Brian and Karen made sure to furnish this place with lots of love and when you first step in your definitely greeted by peace and harmony. I would recommend this place to everyone. They are amazing host! They were very present and anytime we had a question or concern they responded immediately. We will definitely be coming back!"

The beautifully-appointed apartment with private entrance and modern amenities (love the heated bidet!) made us feel like we were on a Mediterranean vacation, only minutes from Harrisburg. As described, Karen & Brian live upstairs, so they were quick to respond to our requests. We chose The Villa because it offered the indoor pool and hot tub, which was exactly what we needed! We can’t wait to come back, perhaps in late spring or summer when we can take advantage of the fire pit and private patio or the outdoor pool deck. Over all, it was a fantastic retreat!
Thank you so much Karen & Brian."

Stayed a few nights","Honest reviews are crucial for enhancing future guests' experiences. Karen proved to be a great host, but challenges with the pool and hot tub impacted our stay. Despite requesting prior to our stay a safe temperature of 100 for my pregnancy, the hot tub consistently exceeded limits at 102-104. Making it hard to put more than my legs in. The pool, advertised at 83-85, measured 73-75, affecting our plans. Despite shivering I was able to swim for a short period of time. When brought to the host's attention, the advice was to swim when the sun was out. The long icy path to the pool room and the requirement to remove shoes in the cold were inconvenient.
Cleaning standards were lacking, with dead bugs in the bathroom, hair in sinks and bed, and potential dirt/debris in one bed. We made the best of it, enjoying game nights with provided board games, but suggest improvements for future guests.
Also keep in mind the guests are beneath the hosts and can hear each other when walking and talking"

Stayed with kids","What a great time we had. Karen & Brian have a wonderful place; beautifully landscaped, a gorgeous indoor pool oasis (you don’t feel like you’re indoors) and a comfortable, quiet and clean living space.
They gave clear instructions for check-in, for leaving and all the fun in between. There were plenty of magazines and brochures available to us to figure out what we wanted to do, and we took advantage of some of the dining recommendations provided.
The bedrooms were comfortable, well suited for myself and two kids. The bathroom was dreamy with a double vanity so teeth brushing wasn’t a chore. And there were plenty of towels and things available to use should we have needed.
The kitchen was stocked with spices which I enjoyed and plenty of room in the fridge for all the food we didn’t cook 😂.
I don’t think they missed a beat when constructing their vision for their guests. I’d recommend this place to anyone. We are already talking about going back soon! Thank you Karen and Brian!"

Stayed with kids","This accommodation was very nice and Brian and Karen are great hosts; very friendly and responsive! We loved the patio outside and the deer that visited. The private entrance and parking were wonderful. This villa is located in an upscale, safe neighborhood, which is very important to us. Personally, I found the temperature in the unit very cold, but my sister loved it. The host provides space heaters so I was able to sleep well. We used the pool twice, and the hot tub was broken so we couldn't use that. The hosts were at the mercy of servicemen and it was out of their control.
We enjoyed the kitchen and the host even let us borrow their hand mixer and a pie plate. Oh, and the microwave also doubles as a convection oven so we were able to cook!
There is little room for the fold-out bed (we set it up in the living room), but it's a nice option if you need it (we did.)
Overall we had an excellent stay and I would definitely recommend it!"

We would have loved more time in the pool but understand the generous opportunity the owners offer to others to rent/use. We stayed for two nights and our pool time was 6-10pm and 8-10pm. I loved the complimentary coffee and tea. The whole apartment is updated and cozy. We loved the bathroom, too. Especially the toilet seat. There’s a warmer on it! And more!

Stayed about a week","Brian and Karen’s place was perfect! It has all the comforts of home. They communicated with me before my arrival so I felt prepared when checking in. They made it feel like staying at a friends place. Unfortunately, I was too busy to try out the pool but if I had the time, I would have used it!"

Stayed about a week","Great stay overall…loved the kitchen as it had everything I needed plus some (I mean storage containers, seasonings, coffee, and etc.)! Additionally, the bathroom had all the toiletries you would need if you left something at home. I was sad that I forgot my swimsuit so I did not get a chance to utilize the hot tub. One minor setback “for me” is that it just didn’t feel very private. I could hear people above me so I felt as if I could hear them, they could hear me…so I was mindful to be very quiet (that’s just me and definitely was not a dealbreaker). Great host and very attentive to their guest. My husband loved the apartment."

Stayed about a week","Karen and Brian were perfect hosts - even bringing me a keurig theraflu pod when i got sick during the last days of our stay!
They offered to let me stay an additional day even though it would result in compressed cleaning & prep time between guests. They were willing to put themselves out to help me…that is rare."

Stayed a few nights","This was literally the best airbnb that my wife and I have ever stayed at. The photos do not do this home justice. It is much better felt than seen. When in Harrisburg, this will be our only option. The hosts are great, and the place is so peaceful."

Stayed a few nights","I truly enjoyed my stay. It was nice, it was relaxing, it was cozy. Brian was awesome for me as well as Karen. But I like the fact that Brian was there because whenever there was an issue (hardly any!), he was the one I spoke with. Because I'm a man speaking to a man it was easier for me to ask for things that I would feel less comfortable asking a woman about. So, it was cool that we had Brian and Karen. They both were fully attentive to all of my needs so they made it great! Just remember that the villa that you're in is underneath their house with all the pros and cons thereof. But, it was comfortable and a very nice stay."

Stayed a few nights","I cannot praise this host enough for all the special touches, the classy and comfortable accommodations, the POOL!!! They thought of everything from a fully outfitted kitchen to a bathroom full of helpful toiletries “just in case” but wow - how beautiful and clean and organized! It truly felt like home away from home. The TV, fireplace, comfy linens and plentiful towels, hangers, blankets/throws, kitchen cookware and even spices, food prep items, gorgeous dishes and cutlery, just above and beyond. Dedicated parking spaces, our own private entrance, access to pool and hot tub (who has THAT in the winter, huh??) large Fire TV, gas fireplace, TWO bedrooms, gorgeous dining area, washer dryer… and any time I had a question they were quick to respond and very patient with me as I figured things out. We WILL be back. THANK YOU, Karen and Brian, for everything you have done to make your AirBnb the best in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I had an absolutely lovely stay at this location. The hosts were very friendly and they had great communication which was incredibly helpful to us. The apartment was perfect for our weekend away, and the pool was beautiful and refreshing. I would definitely recommend this location if you are looking for somewhere to stay in Harrisburg!"
