Stayed a few nights","Great place. Love the corner upper loft (#12). Feels like you’re in a piece of the city and a piece of the woods at the same time, I loved that. Brent and Jacob were proactive and forthcoming to help. Very communicative. The place itself was great. Simple, quiet, peaceful. There’s not much to work with in the kitchen.. definitely not a place I would do much cooking at. But I eat out a lot anyway so that didn’t bother me.
My only other small caveat is the awkwardness of directly being asked for a 5 star review. It just feels a bit tacky.. The home and the host are definitely worthy of the 5 star review - but don’t ask me for it. That’s like a waiter asking for a tip, it just makes you a bit uncomfortable.
But that doesn’t take away from how great of a stay and how responsive and professional Brent and Jacob were otherwise. Definitely would recommend, and I hope to come back again soon. Thank you guys for a wonderful stay. 🙏🏻"

Stayed one night","Always a wonderful stay here. I've used Brent's Airbnb's before and they're my go to for a still-local stay when I just want some peace and quiet and space for myself. They're always spotless and immaculately maintained. The beds are super comfy, it's quiet and calm. Couldn't recommend more!"

Stayed a few nights",Can’t say anything but positive feedback from my stay. I came in to town for a couple friends. I saw the place and thought that’s perfect for just me and it was! There are other people in the other building apartments and they are super nice so if you book just don’t feel hesitant to say hey. The place is well kept up with and perfect for 2. The price was perfect for my weekend getaway without breaking the bank. If you’re looking to come to town this should definitely be on the list for places to possibly book. I will definitely be coming back

Bed was comfy and we slept well with the fan provided. SO close to downtown JC, but with the pathways nearby in a wooded area, had that mountain feel. Lastly, he was quick to respond, which is always appreciated as a guest!"

Stayed one night","firstly upon entering, the first thing you are hit with is a horrible musty smell. second the home must have mold or something because myself and my girlfriend were able to sleep for 3 hours and left at 3am with respiratory issues to go the hospital. the home has mold do not rent here.
there no appliances or even a fork in the home either. you can hear every single thing going on around you and the neighbors are extremely rude. the host is non existent it's just some 3rd party company who offers no help. save your money and just get a hotel.
I'd ask for my money back sense we couldn't stay in the unit but there wouldn't be a response. do not waste your time."

Stayed a few nights","We loved Amy's place. We visit Johnson City often as we have a student at ETSU. This suite is the quietest place we've stayed in the downtown/ETSU area. We didn't hear the train! If you know JC you know about the train horns! The suite was spotless, had a very comfortable bed, and a nice bathroom. There were snacks, kcups and bottled water were provided. Amy's directions were very clear. She was very responsive before, during and after our stay. The suite is connected to the main house but we never heard one sound from the main house. We will stay here again when it's available on our trips!"

Stayed one night","This place was wonderful! My only note is that I wouldn't say it's walkable to downtown. Unless there's another path that we didn't find, the sidewalk would have been about half a mile and we didn't feel particularly comfortable walking that way. That being said, the space was clean and very comfortable and the amenities were great! The location was private and peaceful."

The only comment I have is it’s a downstairs room that does not have its own controllable AC so it was quite warm. Thankfully, the night we stayed was very cool outside so we slept with the windows open and had no issues! Great place overall though."

The room was perfectly appointed and felt like a getaway. The fireplace was a nice touch and the shower was fun to use. The space was pristine without being sterile.
Amy was quick to respond to my messages letting her know about my late arrival and made sure check in was smooth (it was easy, and parking is steps away from the door). I will recommend this location to my colleagues traveling to the area and also recommended to locals I visited while in town."

Stayed a few nights","Amy's place was quaint and special. The bed was so comfortable and the style is exactly what the space calls for. The exposed beams overhead are perfection. The shiplap is elegant and rustic. I loved all the plaids. The kitchen is really all you need for a few nights' stay. The driveway up to the house is tight and a little adventurous if you aren't used to driving up hills, but it was fun and I loved the view from the yard. Amy's husband was helpful when I accidentally locked myself out by using the manual lock instead of the code from the outside (be sure to ask them about that or you may lock yourself out, too!). We were told there are deer on the property but we missed them. The windows allowed us to observe frequent squirrel and bird visitors.
I loved that though we felt we were off the beaten path, we were literally minutes away from cute downtown restaurants (I love downtown JC!).
It's a lovely property - safe, clean, and affordable!
Definitely go!"

Stayed one night","First and foremost - the location is perfect for a quick Uber downtown. The room was clean and even had a few snacks and juices/waters. A wonderful additional surprise! Coffee and creamer were available as well. The owner was wonderful to allow us to reschedule when we needed! Much appreciated.
Now, on to the best of it - the room is part of what I assume is a fairly old home. The modernized touches were just right to accent the beauty of the home itself. A working electric fireplace added a beautiful touch! The separated shower/toilet areas were wonderful. Another beautiful surprise in a heated towel rack (that we are now looking to purchase for our own home). Take a minute to enjoy the beauty of this gorgeous home! It is unique and gorgeous.
Just a note for convenience: if you should need it grab some ice on the way in as the fridge does not have an ice maker. And, should it matter, I didn't see a way to adjust the temperature in the room outside of the fireplace. We were perfectly comfortable, however.
Just book it. You'll be glad you did. We will definitely be back and more than once or twice."

On top of the expected Keurig with pods. We also enjoyed the fireplace. It definitely heated the room. The bed was comfortable, with additional blankets, if needed."

It was well lit for middle of the night trips. The bed was very comfortable, it was very easy to find, and I plan on making another reservation as soon as I'm done typing this review!!"

Stayed one night","Refreshing. Relaxing. Cozy. Slept great. Very comfortable bed. (Thankfully, no memory foam mattress) Often a good price means a drop in the important elements of comfort or cleanliness. Katies place was very clean with an inviting warm chic ambience. Due to the brevity of my stay I choose not to contact Katie, except once and she responded very quickly. Informative notes: . Lighting for hair/makeup a lil difficult as light not directly above mirror. No full length mirror. I kept the toilet lid closed, due to the strong smell of a slow deteriorating toilet bowl cleaner. The windows open easily to air out the room. Nice bright lite with curtains open. 3 steps into the bathroom. Inside temperature was comfortable, it was warmer at night and chilly in the am (outside temp 50's). No washcloth, but had 2 hand towels and multiple towels to more than compensate. Enjoyed the plugin ambient lights. I took a bath and there was plenty of hot water. Epson salt was quite a lovely touch."

Her quick responses to my messages and any needs I have not gone unnoticed. She prepared a guidebook for guests to know the best places in the city.

Stayed one night","Katie's spot was perfectly located on a quiet street, but just a quick drive to Johnson City's charming downtown. Had a nice meal at Holy Taco but sadly missed out at Yee-Haw as they close at 9 and I showed up at 9:10. The little apartment was colorfully decorated and felt right at home. Not every Airbnb has a tub so I appreciated a soak at the end of the night. Highly recommended."

If you are coming into the TRI airport it will take you 30 minutes to get to the location. There is a Keurig which I liked. The little refrigerater worked great, there is a microwave but I did not use this. One thing is there is no shower just the bathtub but I managed with this. Also there was no TV but I used my Ipad with the free WiFi she provided. All in all the place was convenient, clean and worth the price. Katie got right back with me on a couple of questions."

Only thing that would make this place absolutely perfect is if it had a shower on top of the bath, but that's just my pregnant self having trouble using a bath for a whole month haha seriously though, I truly enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","This cute boho style apartment was both roomy and nicely decorated. It consisted of three rooms with the kitchen off one of the rooms. We loved the safety of the area, the ability to be in the historic district and the overall cleanliness of the entire space. We had a couple of tiny issues with the main one being quite warm at night. The unit is cooled by two window units; one located in the kitchen/eat in area and the other in the bedroom. We did not bring this issue to the attention of the host as I never touched the unit in the kitchen/eat in area so it may have been rectified by that. Also had contacted him about some additional linens but he said he was having trouble getting his messages and was sorry he never responded. Considering how his other reviews are so good at communication I believe he would have taken care of this had he known. So overall, nice stay in a beautiful safe area."

Stayed one night","We had a such a great time on our quick stay overnight. If you like privacy this is the place! It was out of the way and very quiet. A walk would have been nice as described by the owner, but time wouldn't allow.
Our events of the day brought us to the property after dark which made for a very cautious drive on small, country roads, but the GPS brought us right where we needed to be! Entry was easy and actually, since we arrived after dark the gate was a nice sense of security. I travel this route a few times a year and will definitely be keeping this wonderful house on my list of returns!
The host was responsive, the place was very clean and cozy. I would recommend staying here."

The trail and view from right on the property is awesome to take your dogs on an easy walk, especially at sunrise is a great way to jumpstart your day. There are numerous other trails within 20-30 mins as well. Will definitely be recommending this Airbnb to friends and family!"

Stayed with a pet","We recently enjoyed a stay at the Serenity Cabin and found it to be a peaceful retreat. The property itself is a paradise. The gated entrance, long private driveway, and mountaintop 360-degree views gave us a sense of seclusion and tranquility that's hard to find. We took advantage of the opportunity to hike some of the trails and our dog absolutely loved it! We got to meet the alpacas and goat on a couple of occasions. They were really interested in our dog!
About the only negative we could find is the wifi speeds seemed to be a little slow depending on the time of day.
If you're looking for a peaceful and beautiful stay in the mountains, look no further. This place is a hidden paradise! Thank you for an amazing experience!"

Stayed with a pet","We enjoyed our stay at the Fluffy Bottom Farm’s Serenity Cabin. The bath tub is as cool as it looks in the photos. We did a nice hike around the property and the trail is well marked and easy to follow. Used the propane grill, and enjoyed breakfast on the downstairs and upstairs patios. Roasted some marshmallows using the giant solo stove and appreciated the firewood available by the hosts. Cabin is secluded enough to feel like you’re by yourself, but also close enough to be able to drive into Johnson City and grab a burger at Pals, visit Dos Gatos coffee, or grab a beer at Yee-haw brewery. Wife’s review: “Beautiful.”"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Fluffy Bottom Serenity Cabin was everything we expected and more! Our instructions from Daniel and Ashley were thorough making locating the cabin and checking in a breeze. The cabin was clean, cozy, and well decorated. The bedroom is beautiful with a vaulted ceiling and the bed and bedding is soft and comfortable. We brought bubble bath with us and relaxed in the large soaking tub every night. There were candles already there that made it extra romantic. The porch off of the bedroom was a great place for us to read, enjoy our morning coffee, and listen to the peaceful sounds of nature. We took a few walks around the property while we were there and visited the mini farm where we were able to pet and feed the llamas, pigs, and goat. We also walked to the top of the property where you have great views and can watch the sun set. We were able to meet Daniel and Ashley during our stay and they are kind, approachable, and very hospitable. We hope to visit again one day!!"

The only down side was we were driving a Dodge Challenger, and they are kind of low so a difficult getting up and down the hill to the house but we made it work! We walked into a nice cool air conditioned house, definitely nice on a warm day. The bath tub is absolutely beautiful, with a great view. We were bummed we didn't get to see any animals, but maybe next time they will be out!😊Definitely the perfect house to get some peace, quiet and relaxation!"

Stayed a few nights","Serenity describes this place to a tee. Beautiful, quiet, very well-decorated, high quality, peaceful, are also all words and phrases I’d use to describe this place. It’s 20 minutes from Bristol if you’re here for a race, or 15 minutes from the quaint downtown area of Johnson City where great restaurants and safe walking at night were a highlight for us. The menagerie of animals walking around the property is also quite entertaining. The hosts are both attentive, yet respectfully out of sight. You will not regret staying here."

In the morning, we were able to see the animals graze which was exciting. The views surrounding the cabin are spectacular! It is private and secluded, and takes you back to a simpler time where you can just relax and enjoy nature, but with all the modern amenities one might need."

The following morning all the farm babies were out and about (they paid no mind to my fur baby that travels with me! Lovely getaway 💙. Absolutely would stay here again.
* I didn’t have service at the gate for check-in so screenshot the code. Could have just been my phone but definitely a helpful tip really anywhere you stay."

Daniel was fantastic with communication and made sure we got checked in ok. I spent every night in the tub and would have taken the sweet animals home with us if we could have! Directions and check in instructions were clear and easy to follow. My husband and I spent a special weekend here between our event at Bristol Motor Speedway and our exploration of local eats. We would love to stay here again and are thankful that Daniel and his family shared such a special place with us."

**Check-in Process:**
- Rating: 5 out of 5
- The check-in process was smooth and straightforward. Clear instructions were provided, and there were no issues accessing the property.
**Parking:**
- Rating: 5 out of 5
- Ample parking available nearby. It was easy to find a spot, and the location felt safe for leaving the car overnight.
**Sound:**
- Rating: 3 out of 5
- with proper sound machines running at night, the only noise you’ll hear is the occasional train.
Despite the train noise, I am giving this Airbnb an overall 5 out of 5 because it is really nice and close to multiple bars and restaurants. The location, cleanliness, and overall experience were excellent, making it a great choice for a weekend stay."

The host was wonderful and helped us out when called to do so. We also plan to use the host as our realtor. P.s.. if you stay here in the summer, make sure you take a drink to the back porch at night and watch the deer and lightning bugs/fire flies. Thousands of them. Thank you for sharing your home with us."

Great water pressure and there was always plenty of hot water. Having breakfast provided was extremely thoughtful and it was nice having a Keurig. WiFi was really good.

Group trip","I had stayed at another property managed by David and Lori about a year ago so felt I knew what to expect. This proved to be the case. House was clean and had all the described amenities. Location was convenient to all the venues we were visiting for our disc golf event- Kingsport, Johnson City, and Fall Branch. Only drawbacks as I saw it were a few boards on the deck which could stand to be replaced (did not effect utility of deck) and the futon being somewhat uncomfortable for adult sleeping. Great value for the price. Would 100% stay again."

Our only complaint was that it felt a little less like the beautiful country setting that we were looking for when we decided to stay onthe outskirts of Johnson City rather than downtown. But we still had a great trip and it was a great house.

Owner has snacks and milk and cereal already there for guests and that was very helpful. Coffee and creamer along with flavored creamer was there and available for our convenience to not have to go get those.
Beds were fairly comfortable and we all slept well after a full day of hiking and visiting with family. Lots to do in the area.

The kitchen is workable; but not an upgrade. She showers were difficult to operate.

The beds were not super comfortable but we are ""extra"" with our super ridiculous mattress and foam topper at home so it could just be us. The house was full of character and very kid friendly. They had toys, games, and books. It was very clean. The house is fully stocked as if the owners just left for a long weekend. Shampoo, conditioner, tons of towels, etc. There is a small TV in the master and a TV in the living room. Both have Roku with several working apps including Netflix. WiFi was fast. Water pressure was good. Water was hot. All in all the house is showing signs of wear but the owners make up for it in personal touches. We enjoyed our stay."

Couldn't ask for a more thoughtful host and Hostess, if you needed it and they didn't have it in the house it's probably something that you didn't need anyway. They offered more cooking and comfy conveniences than any other Airbnb I've ever stayed in. (there's been quite a few in my travels around the world) We loved it so much but I've already booked in another weekend. if you booked into this Airbnb with Lori and David you definitely will not be let down. thank you again for a great day looking forward to seeing you all again soon."

Together, we cooked, drank wine, sang around the table, danced the Texas Two Step and a Waltz in the family room, ate popcorn while watching Nemo on Disney and another night we watched Netflix. The house is cozy! Pickup all your grocery needs before you arrive and then “stay put” and enjoy!"

Stayed with kids","This Country Home in Johnson City is 5 Star! Rest assured you’ll have everything you need for your stay. We came from California to visit my Dad and family in the Tri-Cities area. Due to the pandemic, we had to modify greatly our plans. This home enabled us to have a few family members visit in a safe way. Ingles grocery store is a couple miles away so we were able to cook most meals in this lovely kitchen. Sharp knives, plenty of counter space, oils, spices, lovely matching plates and cups, keurig coffee, French press, cream, sugar, cereals, juices.... wow! That’s what you call going the extra mile. The outdoor deck has a stunning view especially at sunset. At sunrise, you can be serenaded while sipping coffee by the beautiful little birds perching on the trees out back. (Chair cushions in the chest by the grill). Fireplaces were both warm and added a soothing ambiance. My daughter loved all of the board games there. This place is 100% family friendly! (And I actually found a game that I could beat her at ;) whooo connect 4!)
Acoustics in this home are amazing. Trying singing in the loft. You’ll be amazed at the sound. What a fun space in this home.
Master bed was very comfortable (firm-just how I like it). Plenty of pillows, blankets, towels, etc. Oh and the master bathtub.... Jacuzzi tub. Most of us travelers could use a reset for our aching backs. This was it!
The whole place was sparkling clean and well stocked with lots of little touches. Once inside, you can take the garage door opener with you when you come and go. The neighborhood felt very safe but this was an extra special touch for me as I loaded and unloaded the vehicle from the garage.
What else can I say.... this place was perfect for us. Bright and cheerful. Gorgeous windows and views. Clean. Comfortable. Safe. It was a place of respite in these crazy pandemic times. I highly recommend it to other travelers and I hope to stay here again in the future visits with my Dad."

Coffee, juice, cereal, full kitchen, two full bathrooms and a clean jacuzzi soaker tub. The quiet neighborhood and a garage to park your ride is also very nice. The wrap around back deck is nice for cooler evenings and socializing, but needs a little work as stated in the listing. All in all, we got to get away from home, & have all the comforts of home at the same time. Definitely 5*
PS we loved the paintings that we assumed were from Lori and her daughter, very nice touch. Oh and if you love to read, there an endless supply of reading material, movies to watch. 👍🙌💞"

Just some notes for awareness, the mattress in the master bedroom was squeaky which might be an issue for couples that move around a lot. All the pillows were very soft, so for those wanting firm pillows, bring your own. Lastly, figure out the shower while you are fully awake and not while half asleep at 6 AM."

Stayed a few nights","This is an GREAT stay in JC at a GREAT price! The location is close to many restaurants & shops downtown within walking distance. The apt is just as presented in photos. It’s decorated nicely in a minimal, urban / industrial style & very spacious. Large windows line the street facing wall so it’s airy & bright. I’m VERY picky about cleanliness, & this apt did not disappoint. Everything was very clean. Bathroom, kitchen, dishes, …everything. The bed & pillows were super comfortable & a rollaway bed was provided for additional guests. The linens were high quality & very comfortable. Not those cheap sheets you find in some rentals that feel like you’re sleeping on paper towels. I would be remiss not to mention that the apt is located very close to railroad tracks and the train comes thru multiple times, day & night. It’s loud, but did not bother me at all. The rugs could use replacing due to general wear and tare. Overall, best Airbnb I’ve booked. Would recommend & stay again. Thanks!"

The train is no joke though, but ear plugs are provided and sleep mask don’t hurt since the street lights come in some around the curtains. However, the location is smack dab in the middle of downtown, making lots of food an drink options very accessible. Just make sure you nab your parking spot before 6 on a weekend night."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for the Bristol Motor Speedway NASCAR race in the fall. It was about 26 minutes from the track. The apartment was great. Check in was easy and the instructions were very clear. There are several stairs to get to the entrance. There is some street parking and the lot across from the loft was also free. We got a space everytime we returned. The host had the bed prepared with sheets & pillowcases and there were towels in the bathroom for 2 people. There was even a ""makeup"" cloth which was a super nice idea! Everything was clean and organized. There was a new sponge, soap, and paper towels in the kitchen. The bed was comfortable too. The train goes by every 4 hours so definitely bring ear plugs. There were several new packs in the bedside drawer! We utilized the noise machine that was provided as well. You can hear the neighbors walking around but it wasn't disturbing to our stay. Easily walk to several nearby restaurants, breweries, and things to do! Overall, great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Convenient and centrally located spot, right in downtown. The studio had a warm and welcoming vibe with a comfortable bed, smart TV, sectional couch, and bath. I can't say anything negative about the place. You're within walking distance to downtown spots with impressive menus. If you need a weekend away, for yourself or with a significant other, this spot is phenomenal. You can take a bike out for the day, wash up for dinner and a date night, and finish with a drink at a local spot.
Brett was incredibly responsive and worked with me like no other. I was in the area for something work-related but would definitely come back with the family for a weekend. If you need some time away and a few nights spent downtown, or if you want to be a short drive to nature and the outdoors, this place is it."

Stayed a few nights","We liked the loft overall. There are trains that run throughout the night just yards away from the loft which was a bit annoying. The host was very attentive to an issue with the bathroom sink not providing hot water. He had the issue resolved within hours of informing him.
There were also some small amenities that were overlooked... coffee filters, sugar, perhaps some basic spices too. If your loft has a kitchen users should not have to run out to get every little thing that most people use daily like salt, pepper, plastic wrap or foil. Just basics, nothing fancy would be helpful.
Would I use this facility again... likely yes but we would be a bit more prepared ourselves."

Broken window was sealed up but property manager messaged me to inform me before my arrival. Super close walking to everything.
I am a hard sleeper, but be advised that they offer earplugs for a reason. The location is great but a train runs through downtown and folks are out and about late late. Worked great for my visit because I attended a local show that was late. Might not be for all.
Communication was great! I had no need to contact anyone, but had phone numbers out wide of the app in the case they were needed.
Overall, good experience here! Will recommend to friends if I’m not in town myself"

I was so happy to not have to worry about anything and truly be present for a fabulous weekend, enjoying the Thirsty Orange Festival, diverse resteraunt selections, and sharing laughs with reunited friends!
The primary bedroom/bathroom was a most welcome retreat and showering in what felt like a spa was the treat I needed after hosting friends. This space has been well thought out & exceptionally executed. I very much look forward to booking again and I am sharing the link with all of my friends on social media.

There is a gym downstairs and someone was going ham wild Rocky Balboa on a workout at about 3am but it cracked us up! We laughed and laughed so hard. It made the whole night so much more endearing!

I marveled over the master bathtub the last time and mentioned it when I asked about the availability of early check-in on this visit. When I arrived- the master bedroom TV was set to fireplace mode, there was the addition of bathsalts next to the bathtub, and the towels were warmed for me! Alex and the team really do go above and beyond. The place is pristine, and the housekeeping is second to none. The location is within walking distance of the most amazing food and drinks Johnson City has to offer. I always sleep so comfortably here, and I never miss an opportunity to slide down the hallway in my socks(with zero fear of splinters). The lighting, the decor, and the vibe are all so very well thought out! I can't wait for my next visit. I know someone is scrolling these reviews trying to decide if this is the one.....Book this.

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the best Airbnbs in JC! We visit often and have stayed in a myriad of them over the past few years. I am putting this space at the top of my list from now on (provided we don’t bring the whole family).
The location was perfect - right downtown. The entire loft was ours, so it was super spacious, and we felt free to talk and watch tv without disturbing neighbors. It was incredibly clean, the decor was modern and in excellent condition (be mindful that there is a lot of white). We also appreciated that streaming services were set up for guest access and we didn’t have to go through all of the motions to sign in and out of our accounts!
Be sure you are aware that the second bedroom is very tight and is designed to be efficient for sleeping. It was fine for us, since we used it for two teenagers, but it would be too small for all four of our kids. The master suite is incredible. The icing on the cake is that the price was actually reasonable! We will be back!"

While only my husband and I were staying, there would have been plenty of elbow room to host many more people.
The location was perfect for exploring the best of Johnson City. We've visited Johnson City often to see my son and his family. We typically stay at a nice local hotel but will check availability here first for all future visits."

Very well thought out space with so many places to relax along close proximity to bars/restaurants. As with all older buildings it was a little noisy, but not too surprising for a downtown Friday night. Our only concern was the types of people nearby. Multiple individuals appearing to be drug induced along with an increase in homeless population. I understand this isn’t uncommon in train/college towns, but it was a little unsettling with small children."

Stayed a few nights","DREAMMMMMYY! This place was even more beautiful and bougie than the pictures. Beautiful loft, super tall ceilings, exposed brick inside, giant open kitchen, boho decor, I could go on. Beautiful touches, lots of green. There was even a massive LIVE fig tree in the master bedroom. Extremely clean. I felt like I was staying at a friend's house, rather than a hotel where I needed to keep my shoes on and check all the sheets and towels for stains. I never even thought about it. The master bath was massive and had heated floors and a heated towel rack, as well as a gorgeous tub with candles. Great place for entertaining and making dinner together.
Only downside was it's in an area where there is a nightlife, which is cool if you're out, but if your'e going to bed, we experienced some noise from the 24hour gym underneath, as well as some loud cars and people outside bars. But overall, would highly recommend and I was inspired to up my home decor after staying there!"

The common area was well decorated and Meg provided all of the amenities listed and more. There was a welcome basket that we saw right when we walked in. The bedrooms were greatly decorated and spacious as were the bathrooms. The only complaint that we had was not towards Meg but towards the surrounding area as she is unable to control it. Finding parking on a Friday night, close to the loft, was extremely difficult and frustrating due to the bustling of the city on the weekend. Also, because it was the weekend and people were going out, we were able to hear their voices from our bedrooms. Overall, the loft was an amazing place and we would love to come back!"

Meg is an excellent host.
One thing to note about the location is that is in the center of the nightlife of Johnson City. I think it's fun, with some nice restaurants and bars very close by that aren't pricey like in big cities. It's a bit lively, say from Thursday-Saturday, so sometimes you'll hear noise late at night. This was no problem for us."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here on a Monday night and a Tuesday night. Meg and Jen are fabulous hosts and we couldn't have been happier.
We loved the size of the loft and the spacious common area (kitchen / dining / living area). Thoughtfully decorated and very comfortable.
The small bedroom with the bunk bed was actually perfect for me (Dad) - very quiet and dark with the door closed. I slept very well there. My daughter very much enjoyed the huge master suite.
We did not have any problems parking - on-street parking was available most of the time; the parking lot in back of the loft was always available as well. Meg and Jen provided great recommendations for other parking spaces/lots nearby.
I initially had a concern about the noise in the area, as noted by a previous guest. Here are my thoughts on this issue: the loft is located downtown with great access to restaurants and breweries. The foot traffic in front of the loft was generally quiet; some traffic noise reached the loft, but the bedrooms are in back, away from the street. None of the ambient noise (which was generally minimal) bothered us. During the evening/night hours, we recall hearing one train pass through downtown, which did not bother us. The sound landscape added to the enjoyment of our stay.
In short, we would absolutely stay here again and hope that we have an opportunity to return soon."

Stayed a few nights","The Casablanca is ""immaculatta"". Seriously, it's beautiful and very well appointed. The high ceilings, giant windows, lovely wood floors, exposed brick, spa-like decor - all of it is just as advertised. Meg was incredibly responsive throughout our stay. She has done a great job of adding the little extras to make sure you enjoy your stay: coffee and creamer, shower products, comfy blankets and bedding, fun furnishings galore! Let's not forget the wonderful soaking tub, bath products, and on-demand water heater to ensure your bubble bath dreams come true!
The location is right in the heart of Johnson City's downtown area which is currently being revitalized. Very convenient to great local coffee, several restaurants and area shops. You will see and hear people on the streets in the evening and the occasional train passing, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the property. There are a couple of clubs and bars down the street which we did not visit, but they were popping on Friday evening. I'm looking for a reason to return to Johnson City, as this would be a great place to host a small gathering of friends to really enjoy the layout of the beautiful common areas! Be sure to grab a latte at Dos Gatos, and don't miss the brussel sprouts at Label."

Group trip","What a great find! We were planning to be in Johnson City for a wedding weekend and spotted David and Karen's listing several months ago. When travelling we usually avoid regular hotels and look for something different with more space or near places we want to frequent. Their place met all those requirements and went way beyond!
The interior is completely unique. If you like any of the Mafia movies you will feel like you stepped back in time and are part of that era only with all the modern features you would want.
We toured several towns in this part of TN and ended up coming back to JC for meals as there are so many great options literally steps from the front door.
David was extremely responsive to any question. We accidentally broke a coffee pot and David magically left a replacement along with a bag of coffee at the door while we were out.
Don't hesitate to stay if you have the chance! We will have lots of fun memories for years to come."

Group trip","Simply put....Wow! 5 stars all the way. The online pictures are beautiful, but still don't do this place justice. This is truly a hidden gem nestled smack in the middle of downtown Johnson City. True ""old timey"" speakeasy feel with all kinds of display cases showing off relics of that unique era of American History.
We had a small family get together to celebrate a birthday. We all came expecting a good time.... and we all left having experienced one of the most memorable, fun filled weekends that we will cherish the memories of for a lifetime. Big thank you to David and Karen for being exceptional hosts. Super responsive. Super accommodating. Expectations were set high....you exceeded them in every sense.
Thinking of visiting Johnson City and you stumbled on this review? Stop searching and book it. You won't regret it. You can thank the hosts again on my behalf!"

The space is EVERYTHING, a perfect, luxurious setting with everything that you could possibly need for anything from a normal stay to an event with 20 people. Every item in the place is of the higheat quality: linens, dinnerware, seating, showers, etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.
The area and location could not be more perfect. It is on a main street that boasts several nice restaurants and bars in the heart of downtown johnson city. The most amazing part is that despite the ongoings outside the space, you cannot hear any of it, it is quiet and private. This is definitely a place we will rent time and again, even for just a night out on the town with friends. ❤️"

While we knew this was a new listing, we trusted our hosts’ exceptional rating for their other property. We were not only *not* disappointed but pleasantly surprised. David met us at the property during check-in to show us around. He showed us the many features (including a secret entrance to the Primary Suite). The space was luxurious and comfortable all at once.
This is a perfect location, walkable distance to restaurants and everything downtown Johnson City has to offer.
We will definitely check to see if Heir Capone is available for any of our future stays in J.C., Tennessee!"

Stayed a few nights","My event was planned around the 1930's era Prohibition/little Chicago setting, and the only thing better than the anticipation of our stay was the stunned appreciation of each guest upon entering. The vibe was mesmerizing, and we were all transported back in time to a lovely amalgamation of period touches, from Sinatra softly playing from the phonograph, to elegant furniture, soft comfortable beds, and beautifully finished bathrooms, to retro reminders of Al Capone, old Tommy Guns, and a fine leather gaming table that would be perfect surrounded by either the Rat Pack, or dogs playing poker.
The bedrooms were elegant and plush, and the Class A environment immediately imbues the evening with a ""special occasion"" status. We took advantage of being in the heart of Downtwon Johnson City, enjoying the nearby restaurants, and pubs, but had plenty of room for our libations in the comfortable and well stocked kitchens. Thank you to our hosts, the night was an instant classic success!"

Stayed with a pet","The Watauga River Cabin was amazing. Clean and quiet, right on the river and not too far from town. The yard was large and fenced. Our dog absolutely loved it and loved playing in the pond (in the yard).
The cabin was well-equipped and very comfortable. The bed was like sleeping in a cloud. The water pressure was great (not something you always get in a cabin in the country). The hot tub was great after a long day of hiking. We spent a lot of time on the deck and front porch, just enjoying being there.
The walk down to the river has some steep steps, but manageable. Or you can walk across the road and down the access path. The grassy area at the river has nice chairs you can just relax or fish. It rained for the first 5 days we were there, so we didn't get to enjoy being on the water (too rough).
Bryan was a great host, quick to respond if we had a question or needed anything. We would love to return...maybe next time, the weather will cooperate."

Loved the view of the Watauga river from the large master bedroom windows and the hot tub! The host Bryan was so welcoming and made sure we knew we could come to him with any needs. He offered that we could use the kayaks etc. The house was clean and comfortable, especially comfy bed and nice sheets! The showers had shampoo etc which I appreciated. The kitchen had what we needed, but we didn't do any cooking. The fridge didn't have any condiments or anything, which is totally fine I'm just saying if you're planning to cook you should bring what you need. We enjoyed the local restaurants especially Juan Siao, Juniper, and Gourmet&company. Overall a lovely stay and an especially friendly host. Would definitely recommend."

Although we had driven 250 miles to visit local relatives, they decided it would be more fun to gather at River Cottage on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. We all enjoyed sitting by the river, fishing, kayaking and visiting while surrounded by the colors of fall. I even baked a cherry pie! The house has rustic charm with all the conveniences - except internet - but who needs internet when enjoying the hot tub? Bryan was very responsive and genuinely wanted us to feel at home and we felt welcome. We suggested he install a handrail from the driveway to the front porch because there are steps which are difficult for some elderly folks to climb. It should be noted that the cottage is not wheelchair accessible. Oh and one final point, the wide plank floors are gorgeous!"

We chose it because of the location and ability to kayak, swim, hot tub, hike, etc. The kayaks were already down by the river and not in the shed next to the house, FYI. Had to do a bit of searching because at first it wasn’t obvious. I wish they had two single person kayaks as opposed to the one double and the one single, but that’s just a mere suggestion. I also wish the host/co-host communicated better. The one host listed in the listing was out of town and was slow to respond with the co hosts information. The fire-pit was also torn apart so we weren’t able to have a fire. Overall - great place, space, etc. Definitely has a ton of potential. We enjoyed ourselves and would come again."

Stayed one night","A unique property located in a peaceful river setting. We were only there for one night (business trip at ETSU), but was able to briefly use the arcade game and hot tub. The setting is nice and tranquil. The cabin is spacious and there is an overstuffed couch and widescreen tv. My coworker actually fell asleep watching Hulu and just stayed on the couch. He said it was super comfortable. I accessed the king sized bed in the expansive master suite and enjoyed it immensely. I was out on the deck early the next morning and witnessed river otters playing and several large birds fishing. The construction next door had stopped when we arrived and hadn't started by the time we left, so I can't speak to that being a problem. We were told that more cabins were being built next door and to expect some noise, but it wasn't an issue. If you are coming for an ETSU campus visit, this location is close enough to campus and offers you a better lodging experience. We hope to stay again."

Stayed with kids","My son and I had a great time and felt so relaxed, the view was so nice and private. We fished, but didn’t catch anything. It was fun anyway. We really liked having a dryer with being in and out of the hot tub The flooring was really pretty, kinda an old timey feel, like a cottage your family had had for generations. Easy to communicate, I would go here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is amazing. The pictures are 100% accurate, it is decorated nicely without being over crowded. The sofa in the living room is comfy, but the master bedroom bed is hands down the best one we have slept on in any Airbnb. The deck is spacious and allows unobtrusive views of the river. Hot tub was perfect after a day of fishing the river or sightseeing. Bryan is an amazing host and is very responsive and helpful. We truly look forward to our next return."

Stayed a few nights","We loved the Wautaga River Cottage! The beds were very comfortable, our son had his own bedroom and bath, the master was large and spacious with a beautiful view of the river. The only drawback was there is no door to the bathroom but we worked it out. We really enjoyed the deck overlooking the river. We saw a family of otters and loved watching the swallows fly out from under the bridge. We enjoyed the kayak, built a fire one night, and loved relaxing in the hot tub watching the fireflies. My husband loved the Ms. Pac Man game a little too much! :) We travel to the area often and always stay in airbnbs and this has ranked as one of our favorite places to stay."

The neighbor must have been working on his motorcycle which made for a pretty noisy neighborhood but Bryan went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed for a great stay. He even replaced some supplies upon request and helped with local information. Definitely recommend Bryan and the River House!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is right on the river. It was an absolute pleasure to sit on the deck and watch the river go by. Delightful! The birds were fantastic! Bryan was great. Easy to deal with, responsive and had great recommendations for local eats. The master bedroom is gorgeous. The second bedroom is nice, but my friend and I had to flip a coin to see who got the fancier bedroom! Not a problem, but if two couples are sharing the house, one couple will get jealous! Both had soft, yummy beds! It was a hot day and the AC worked well to cool off the place. We ate out, so didn't use the kitchen much, but it had everything we needed for coffee and heating up leftovers. Lots of local parks and hiking trails. Close enough to a variety of restaurants. Something for everyone!"

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely adorable cottage on the river. It’s a hidden gem that lets you unwind from the hustle and bustle of every day life. We enjoyed sitting on the porch listening to nature, enjoying the hot tub and fishing on the river. This Airbnb was perfect for the kids and pup. We were rained out one day and enjoyed board games the host had in the cottage. The cottage is very clean and the view of the river from the master bedroom is amazing.
We had a few issues but in all fairness i didn’t reach out to the host for resolution during our stay. The only kayak we could locate in the shed (as instructed) had no paddles and appeared to be a child size. No other kayaks could be found so we couldn’t kayak at all. We found firewood in the shed but no starter log or chairs to go around any fire pit. We found sticks around the yard and paper to get it going. The first night the air wouldn’t kick on for us but thankfully it was tolerable with the fans on.
Visit the recommended diner. Delicious!"

We explored several of the downtown breweries, Yee-Haw was our favorite and we had great pizza at Rocks! We hiked the White Rock Loop at Buffalo Mountain Park, it’s a hard trail but worth it for the view!
The cottage was very clean with the exception of the hot tub having a bit of dirt in it and a few ants in the kitchen (easily fixed and expected following the rain in a cottage on the river).
There is a nice front yard that was perfect for our mini Aussie to stretch his legs and the gate on the deck/porch was awesome to have him outdoors with us without the worry of wandering off!
Overall it was an amazing weekend, we wished we had booked an extra night!!"

The location is ideal for those seeking a quiet and peaceful escape, while still only 15-20 minutes from Johnson City. We came to hike, so it was also perfectly central to all the goodness that surrounding state and national forests have to offer. We did plenty of cooking and found the kitchen well-equipped. Bryan was kind and communicated appropriately, like when someone would be coming over briefly to service the hot tub. We were sad to leave, but glad to know we found a paradise in Eastern TN to return to again soon."

Stayed a few nights","My fiancé and I just got back from our trip and we already wish we could go back. We absolutely loved staying here. We were traveling all over Tennessee to check out different areas and this was by far our favorite. Being right next to the river was magical, and being able to kayak was the best. The area itself is absolutely beautiful to go for a morning walk by the river. We also loved the little diner down the road and talking with everyone in there (also their delicious food). Thank you again for everything, and making our trip wonderful!"

Stayed one night","We had a great time at this AirBnB. It was clear during our stay that it this house was not a lived-in home because it was just a little devoid of soul – a missing bedside table and lamp here, poor lighting there in the kitchen, a bit randomly placed furniture, etc. However, the real appeal of this home is the river right outside. There's a beautiful view from the hot tub and morning kayaking was just gorgeous for an out-of-towner like me."

We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","We liked this house a lot. It seems like a recent addition/renovation that was put together with a lot of interesting attention to detail and it is still being continually improved. Not the same-old TJ Maxx airbnb decor! Beautiful wide-board hardwood floors and some antique/collectible touches throughout. Very responsive hosting from Daniel. Beautiful spot on the river but be careful about kayaking too far downstream as you might be walking the kayaks back through some stretches which isn't easy. Very big and comfortable bed in the master BR and of course it being a pet-friendly listing is what made it possible for us, so we are grateful for that too."

Stayed a few nights","The location of the cabin far exceeded our expectations. The property was absolutely amazing and spacious, and the river was nothing short of breathtaking. The pictures don’t do this property justice! 10-15 minutes to downtown Johnson City. The cabin was extremely clean and we had everything we could possibly need. Instructions were easy to follow. Bryan was a great host, and this spot has easily become a favorite stay!"

My wife immediately started checking our calendar in the coming months to figure out a return trip. We will be back!! We cannot recommend this property enough. You have to experience it for yourself.

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time at the river cottage! Everything was just as pictured, if not better. The cottage was very well decorated, and you could tell a lot of effort was put in to make it nice. The place was very clean and well-stocked. The bed and linens were very comfortable and clean!
The view of the river from the main bedroom is beautiful! The riverbed is so serene, and it’s a great place to relax. We were just there for a short trip so we didn’t get to enjoy the river itself very much, but it looked very inviting!
The location is great! It’s just a short drive into town. The area was very quiet and felt safe.
I definitely recommend Bryan’s place, and we will likely be back again to visit!"

Stayed a few nights","My goodness… this location is incredible. The house is comfortable and clean but I doubt you’ll spend much time in it. Between the deck, the yard, and the river there’s no reason to go inside unless you’re getting ready to sleep in one of the amazing beds. The sheets and duvet were perfect.
It felt secluded while still being a only a 10-15 min drive to restaurants and stores.
If you’re lucky you might see the little family of otters!! They were so playful and cute."

Stayed one night",Fantastic location on the watauga river. Loved the accommodations. Beds were some of the best I have ever slept on. Close the Johnson city but feels like your way out in the country. Poor internet but the owner says that will be fixed soon. A bit pricey for just 2 but if you had a larger family probably not bad

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at Johnson city! The house was very clean and equipped with all basic necessities. It was comfortable and located in a beautiful area by the river.
We made use of the kayaks that were included with the rental, which made our experience even better!
Also did some fishing in the mornings and evenings. The host was great and very communicative. He provided us with daily information about the river generation hours. He responded to all messages cordially.
We loved the decor as it’s rustic, barn style and it made us feel very comfortable. The views of the house are simply breathtaking! This is the perfect place to disconnect from the daily stress and spend time with your family. We brought our two dogs and went for hikes/waterfalls recommended by Daniel. Daniel was extremely nice and welcoming when we arrived to the property. He made sure the house was well stocked with all needed. We would stay here again and recommend anyone looking for a rental to stay here. Beautiful property and great host! I can continue saying great things because it was simply perfect experience for us! Thank you for everything!"

Stayed with kids",The view of the river that runs along side the cottage was amazing. You will want to spend all your days at it! The cottage is set up very nicely and the view of the Watauga River from the bedroom is great! My teenage son caught his first rainbow trout from the river below. The owners are great and very helpful. Daniel went above and beyond to make sure we had the best stay. We only wish we could have stayed longer!
