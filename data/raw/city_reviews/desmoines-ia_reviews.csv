Stayed one night","This carriage house apartment is the perfect way to experience Des Moines' historic Sherman Hill neighborhood, not far from downtown. Everything was exactly as advertised and check-in was super easy. It's located in a quiet neighborhood a few blocks away from two wonderful micro-breweries... a classic dive bar... and a great market. I look forward to staying here the next time I visit Des Moines!"

Stayed one night","Michael was very communicative when needed, and went above and beyond to accommodate us on our last minute changes. The place was great! It was perfect distance from the concert venue, as it provided a peaceful stay yet short commute to the show. The pictures are accurate and the place was more than enough space for my husband and I. The full kitchenette came in handy too, along with the market suggestion down the street! We will definitely look to rebook if we head to Des Moines again!"

Michael's apartment is clean & cozy with everything I needed for my stay there. This place is top on my list for whenever I need to stop over in Des Moines."

Stayed one night","Michael’s communications via Airbnb were very friendly, nice and hospitable before our arrival. He was extremely generous to accommodate a late checkout for us, which was truly kind and immensely helpful on our long road trip. The unit is designed well and decorated nicely. It has a hip and cool vibe to it. It’s private. It’s an apartment above a garage type building behind the main house with dedicated parking off the alley.
Sadly we think his cleaning team was having an off day, cause the unit was not clean upon our arrival. It’s clear that they made the beds and switched out the towels, but the sinks, toilet, shower, floors, etc looked like they hadn’t actually been cleaned at all. Which was kinda gross. We alerted the host to the issue immediately.
Also both sinks need plumbing help, and leak water from the faucets.
It’s too bad, cause if it had been cleaned properly, it would have been a nice place to stay."

Stayed one night","What a great place to stay. Our accommodations were wonderful - definitely met our expectations; There were a few more steps to get to the upstairs apartment than anticipated, but worked fine for us. Our host, Michael, couldn't have been any more helpful. If you are attending an event at the Hoyt-Sherman Place, this is the ideal place to stay (for a couple). It was walkable to the venue as well as two brew pups and a great local bar (Carl's Place). And also very affordable. I would highly recommend this place...."

Stayed one night","Michael’s place was great and absolutely would recommend to anybody looking for something walkable in downtown Des Moines.
If I have to stretch to find something to mention at all critically, I personally had some trouble getting the AC unit to work the way I intended. I couldn’t figure the damn thing out at all. It wasn’t until morning that my girlfriend pointed out that there was a remote control for it and she had moved it shortly after we had arrived, so mystery solved. Also, when entering the unit you’ll have a fairly steep set of stairs to climb. It didn’t bother me at all, but I could see older guests that wanted to come and go a lot, might have a little trouble there. Keep in mind, I had to DIG to mention those as negatives. Wonderful space, awesome location, and great host. Plus, it is affordable priced and doesn’t hide expense in junk fees."

Stayed one night","We live in the Des Moines metro, but we were invited to the Garden Gate Spring Gala. This organization provides a safe place for exploited women and their children away from the harsh realities of human trafficking.
My wife and I decided that we would make a date night out of the event, and decided that Michael's carriage would be the place we would go to get ready, and also relax after the gala.
Michael was very communicative from the beginning, which was great letting us know our rental was coming up, where a wonderful neighborhood grocery store is, and the amenities he provides.
The communication alone was enough to give Michael a stellar review.
We arrived at the Carriage House so we could get ready for the gala, a what a wonderful place to be. I wrote more, but ran out of characters, so in short stay here and you will not regret it.
Thank you Michael!"

The neighborhood has so much more going on than when I lived there, and being so close to downtown or I-235 to get around is one thing that makes the Sherman Hill area. Definitely recommend staying here if you are going to be spending any time downtown.

Stayed a few nights","Spending the weekend at this location was a tranquil and relaxing experience. It offered a comfortable, secluded, and private space and was located close to a lot of interesting things to do in Des Moines. We experienced some inclement weather during our stay but the tent kept us warm and dry and Melissa was proactive about communicating with us about the weather situation as well as offering a place to shelter in the event of severe weather. We would absolutely book this listing again."

The only downside was it’s pretty close to the main house so not very secluded like it seems. There were also no hiking trails or anything just a small mowed path around the property. Also, the heater turns off in the middle of the night, be weary if you’re staying here in below freezing temperatures!"

The tent had everything we needed, and was very cozy (we turned the heater on overnight and were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it warmed up and how much heat the tent retained!). The hosts provided clear directions and communications beforehand, and it's evident that they have put a lot of effort into making this place feel comfortable and safe. I would definitely recommend this place to others!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a special gift for a dear friend who loves the outdoors. She said she could live there and be perfectly happy! No better review!
I would call this campsite idyllic in every way. The warm fall had waned so the temps were quite a bit cooler but not unbearable for us. We had all our bundling up duds. The heater inside the big tent room really helped a lot! We liked having a tv with lots of options.
We were able to eat our snacks & drinks & the S’mores makings our host provided. LOVED!!
We would have used a microwave but were fine with what we had and did go out to eat at a BBQ place within a mile or two."

Stayed one night","Great upscale camping experience. Bed was comfortable linens were clean and cozy. Warm blankets and pillows on the couch helped add to the ambiance.
Loved the fireside S'mores kit she provided, along with a bottle of wine for our anniversary. It was cooler weather, and the heater in the tent helped keep us comfortable and warm even with strong winds and rain outside.
We enjoyed our time in a natural setting. The composting toilet was different, but it worked for what we needed it for! You can hear traffic, but there's a fan and earplugs in the tent, too if you need them, and with the heater running, it was really no bother. My husband even enjoyed a quick outdoor shower, despite the cool temperature, and commented on how he loved the shower head and that the water was nice and warm!
Overall, it was a great, relaxing stay, just what we needed for some time away, and we would definitely come back again!"

Stayed with kids","We took our two daughters (6 and 3) and had a great time. It feels very secluded without being far away. We struggled to get a fire started due to some damp fire wood, but luckily were close enough to restaurants to bail into town for dinner. The outdoor shower actually has warm water and felt great after a lake visit, and the AC in the tent made it comfortable for sleeping. Our only issue was the campfire - could have used some drier wood/kindling, or should have brought some of our own. Other than that, we had a great time and would go again."

The tent was very clean and comfortable with everything we needed for our stay, including extra bedding for the couch, air conditioning for comfort, a mini fridge for our food, and a solo stove for roasting. We were surrounded by trees for privacy, yet it was just a small walk down a path to get to the site. The outdoor shower provided the necessary privacy, but was a fun and unique experience. The only thing that was less than perfect was the traffic noise, but you are not too far from a big city so that is to be expected. All in all, we would highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed a few nights",We had a fantastic stay in the glamping tent! It was clean and comfortable and feels very private. It was just the relaxing getaway we were hoping for. Delicious coffee in the morning and s’mores over the fire at night! I would highly recommend and we will likely be back for another stay!

Melissa gave very clear directions on how to get there, where to park, and how to access/use supplies provided (which were many). This is the definition of glamping—very clean and orderly, with a binder full of helpful info. Firewood & fire starters provided for the solo stove, a hand towel & hand soap in the outhouse, games, a rack and hangers for clothing, plenty of chairs and tabletops, a nespresso machine with pods and creamer. It seems every little detail was considered. Absolutely perfect—we’re already planning our next stay."

Stayed with kids","What a lovely mother/daughter getaway. I was thrilled to find a glamping option in the Des Moines metro with all the options- outdoor shower (Divine!), private composting toilet, a great firepit area and grill for camp food. The bed was very comfortable and I appreciated the thread count as a bedding snob. We brought an extra air mattress since we had five people, but would have been fine without it. The AC kept the tent very cool, almost chilly :) which made for a great night of sleep. I've referred no less than another 10-15 people to check out the rental. It's no wonder they're booked almost every day of the season. Such a great escape! For ideas- we spent the day at Saylorville lake swimming as well as viewing the bison and elk. There's also a flower farm and putt putt nearby."

She thought of every little detail. King size comfortable bed , very very clean , tv and streaming , games , a mini fridge , nespresso machine , smore supplies and oh , did I mention the bathroom ?? And outdoor shower ?? Very clean too.
The smokeless firepit was awesome and sitting out on the front porch in the morning, drinking coffee. I felt like I was deep in the forest , but we were not. Which was good. We felt very safe. I can’t say enough good things. We will definitely come back ! Do not hesitate to book this Glamping tent. Oh and the directions to get there were spot on."

Stayed one night","I'm going to lead with - it was amazing and I can't wait to go back! We arrived after dark and in the middle of a massive storm, so I didn't have high hopes for a glamping experience, but it was genuinely wonderful. The instructions to get there, where to park, and how to get in were all super easy (even at night in the rain). The tent is beautiful and clean and cozy. We had everything we needed, and listening to the rain was heavenly. In the morning we were able to enjoy a fire and a walk through the trees. I really feel like we need to talk about the outdoor shower though, because it. is. phenomenal. We were a group of three - one experienced ""real"" camper, one experienced glamper, and one ""hotels only please"" non-camper. This experience was top notch for all of us. Highly recommended!"

Stayed one night","This is the perfect getaway location without having to ""rough it"". My granddaughter had recently started asking to go camping and we decided to book the tent for a one night stay on our way to Nebraska as a trial run before doing an actual camping trip with a 3 year old, well this was the absolute best place to try out camping without sacrificing some comforts. The space was super cute and cozy, the firepit area was adorable (the smores kit was such a cute treat), the ac worked very well and the outdoor shower was an awesome experience and there was hot water (not just warm) the bed was comfy and the tv was good to have once the grand baby was ready to put on music videos on YouTube and dance her heart away. The king bed was comfy and the mini fridge came in handy. Dont forget to bring bug spray like the host recommends and a flashlight for night trips to the outhouse. we would definitely love to visit again for longer than one night."

Plenty of wonderful spaces to gather together or retreat to privacy.
Heat in tent was remarkably easy and effective on a chilly night. Tent was close walking distance to the house and yet tucked away out of site.
Since we has the house as well we didn’t really use the toilet or shower at the tent. It was great for sleeping.
Woodsy feel but also really close to the highway. One night we heard simultaneously coyotes howling/barking and motorcycles racing on the highway. Interesting juxtaposition."

Shower had great water pressure! Loved the availability of items for kids from bath toys to high chair etc (we didn’t use any of it as our kids are older but would have loved when they were younger). Would also be a great spot if traveling with pets (we weren’t but it was set up well for it). Availability of twin fold out mattress as well as futon was great for traveling with our children they were comfortable. Only downside is there is foot traffic above you that is loud at times. But was never an issue when sleeping. Sound machine and air purifier fan drown any noise out during sleeping hours."

Inside, everything was organized, clearly labeled, and easy-to-find. The space was just as described, with one bedroom and a cozy living/dining area. The kids' nook had toys, books, coloring activities, games, blocks, legos, and more to entertain my kids in the morning. There was plenty of space to put the twin floor mattress in the living area. Our dog traveled with us, and there were so many supplies available for her--and treats, too. The neighborhood was safe and walkable, with a path to a park/playground just a little ways down the cul-de-sac. The backyard had play structures for the kids. Katy was very flexible with us and extremely helpful when our son had to make an unexpected trip to the nearby Emergency Room. We would ABSOLUTELY stay again--I have never seen such an organized and well-stocked AirBnB! Thank you, Katy!"

The house is on a nice, quiet cul-de-sac surrounded by woods and close to a park. The suite is also very quiet, clean, and welcoming. 10/10 recommend!"

All amenities were listed, we didn’t have trouble finding anything that we needed. Katy’s place was an easy 20 min drive to Paws and Pints which was the reason for our visit.

Stayed one night","This place was absolutely perfection. so many amenities that I wasn't expecting (individual honey packets!! Are you kidding me!). I am not a big ""tap water"" drinker so I was hesitant to try the water when I didn't see a Brita pitcher or water bottles but the tap water was actually really good and tasted filtered. Lastly, be forewarned that you need to walk down a grassy (lumpy) hill to get down to the entrance. It was fine but my knee has been giving me trouble lately so I had to take it slow. Anyhow, awesome place and will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights",Loved my stay at Katy’s little cottage basement! It was very welcoming with all the accent lights left on for me and very clear instructions. It was cozy and extremely clean. Katy thought of all the little details that make a place homey from every kind of blanket to a tea kettle to wee wash cloths for removing one’s makeup. I would not be put off by anyone’s review of her children’s “noise” upstairs. Anything I heard was minimal and nothing outside of what one would hear in even a posh hotel. Highly recommend and hope I’ll have the opportunity to stay again.

You can tell there was a high level of attention to detail and thought in setting up and taking care of the unit. Things like lights and drawers are clearly labeled to make things feel natural. I didn't have my dog with me, but I loved the spot with things like dog treats, a pet bed, towels for wet paws, food and water bowl, and even a blanket to use for dogs who sleep on the bed. Everything was meticulously clean. There was also some snacks out, and helpful books for things like restaurants and hiking in the area. To top it off, I got to see some very fun turkeys outside in the morning! A truly wonderful place to stay!"

Stayed one night","This place sets the gold standard for rentals. I want other AirBnB owners to come to Katy to learn how it's done. I thought the photos and description looked and sounded nice, but the place is even better in person.
The rental was super clean, extremely organized, and fully-stocked. Katy is extremely thoughtful in thinking through everything a guest might need and more- extra bedding, bath supplies, necessities for guests with babies or dogs, etc. Katy is very proactive with communication- emails with check-in instructions, binder of local recommendations, little laminated signs with instructions on how to operate lights, scan a QR code for a video tutorial on how to operate the Roku.
The owners clearly have lots of local pride in Des Moines and Iowa, and it shines through in the decor, books on local points of interest and hiking, etc.
Location is a family-oriented neighborhood with kids playing in the yard, gorgeous mature trees. Feels like staying at a family friend's house."

We also really appreciate that this was a safe space for our cat (she truly enjoyed bird watching).

There were plenty of kids toys appropriate for our kids’ ages, even the 1 year old, and a little nook under the steps that they loved. Everything was extremely clean. Kitchen is well-stocked for cooking. Plenty of extra towels and blankets available. You will hear the family/kids/dog upstairs at times (not an issue for us at all, and the host mentions this in the listing). We’re so glad we stayed here and if we’re in the area we will definitely stay again!"

The kitchen was fully furnished with everything you needed for cooking. They had games, toys, books and puzzles. There were even extras in the bathroom just in case anyone forgets something.
Their neighborhood is super quiet and it was so great to see all the wild turkeys, deer and the little bunny that made It’s home on the patio underneath the grill.
Both Sean and Katy were very helpful and friendly. Their description was thorough and accurate. all of my family felt safe and comfortable. It was a great stay and I would definitely recommend them and would stay there again in the future."

The kids loved seeing the animals in the back yard there were lots of little birds,squirrels, huge turkeys & other large birds. In fact the first things my kiddos noticed were the awesome iowa native wildlife posters in the living room they thought they were fantastic! It was peaceful & a great place to stay! The host was super kind & helpful! I only gave it a 4 stars out of 5 bc the bed in the bedroom was pretty firm & made for an uncomfy sleep for the adults. But the futon & twin floor mattress were very comfy & worked great for the kiddos! Over all great stay & great host!!"

There were a lot of amenities I didn’t use but appreciated like the pack and play, kid’s reading nook, crafts, games, books, local coffee, electric blanket, bath supplies, mosquito repellent, a bbq, and more! That doesn’t even include the amenities I did use! Very pet friendly and aside from some footsteps I actually couldn’t tell there were people living above us. It was also located in a very safe neighborhood. I would recommend this over a hotel, especially if you have pets or need additional/more private space!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a nice stay here in Des Moines. The apartment is comfortable and well equipped. It is a little tricky to get inside because you have to street park until you get inside the apartment to get the gate opener for the adjacent parking, which involves a door code, a lock box, an elevator fob and a door key. But the instructions are clear. Not sure there is anything that can be done to simplify the process. That said, the reserved parking spot is a great bonus.
The listing and pictures are very accurate. Comfortable beds and plenty of towels and linens. You can easily cook in the kitchen. All we did was breakfasts because of the good restaurants within easy walking distance of the apartment.
One thing to note. The apartment is an industrial design with exposed ducts, etc. The two bedrooms are basically open to the main living area in that the walls don’t go all the way to the ceiling in one, and the other has a narrow walkthrough. Fine for a couple, but not private for more."

Stayed a few nights","This place was an amazing pick for my birthday weekend. We loved most everything about it. The hosts gave clear instructions, and the place was easy to find and access.
There was an issue with one of the windows near one of the bedrooms and that made regulating the temperature of the place (it didn’t help that it was February). There was also one morning we went to our car through the back entrance nearest the parking lot, and a homeless person was laying in the entry way. It wasn’t a huge issue, just a little awkward. We also were not able to access the patio because the latch was broken.
Otherwise we loved everything. The decor is modern and rustic, the view was incredible, and it was a 2 minute walk to some of our favorite bars and restaurants. Everything was fully stocked, and we were thankful for that when we realized we’d forgotten a few things. All in all, it was a very positive experience, and I would have given it a 4.5/5 but the app doesn’t recognize half points lol."

However, be aware that this host charges an additional $15/night for each person over 2 people even though this is advertised for 4 people with two king beds. I didn't realize you now are supposed to enter all of the people staying when you first rent the place and it would have automatically added the additional $$. Instead, I found this out on the day of check-in and it caused problems."

The location in the East Village made shopping, eating at restaurants, and visiting some local attractions so easy. We really enjoyed sitting on the balcony, having a drink , and admiring the State Capitol. It is exquisite, and one of the attractions that shouldn't be missed! I contacted Sheila and Kevin a couple of times and they were available immediately and were very helpful. I hope some day I can return to Des Moines. I would love to stay here again!!"

The space was quiet and located above a wonderful restaurant, HoQ, and within a short walking distance of all the shops and restaurants of the East Village. Off-street parking was a plus, as was a very secure entry system in the apartment building. Our only disappointment was that the Des Moines Farmer's Market wasn't in session due to pandemic, but if it had been in session, this apartment would have been in a perfect location to walk to the market!"

Everything is conveniently within walking distance. The bed (including sheets and pillows) and couch was super comfy. The coffee area was my favorite part of each morning and the kitchen table was a perfect spot to get some work done while watching the news. The apartment was well stocked with cleaning and kitchen supplies, making ""staying at home"" for an extended period easy to do. The TV setup was a little wonky, but it was probably partially due to my ignorance re: sling and the rest. All in all, a wonderful stay <3"

Everything in the loft is thoughtfully placed and spotless. The bed we slept in (1 of 2) was quite comfortable, bathroom is large and the kitchen has everything you would need to make simple meals. Sheila was communicative and responsive, and her check-in instructions made arrival and access a breeze. It’s also great that there is a parking spot included.

Completely secure building with parking across the street, which is free after 9 pm if you catch the right spots. Walkable to wonderful restaurants and everything downtown Des Moines has to offer. My only note is the bedroom toward the back of the unit gets a fair amount of street noise. If you are a light sleeper, choose the front bedroom, or bring ear plugs for snoozing. But, honestly, very similiar to what you get in any urban loft space. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dan & his place - awesome host, awesome space, great town! We'll stay again when we come back to Des Moines!"

The only “negative” was that the food places and convenient stores in our immediate vicinity were not open much - which is no fault of Dan’s.

We were able to walk everywhere, and the central location of the condo was quite convenient. The space was very clean, and the layout worked well. The building, itself, could probably use some maintenance, but that's not the host's fault. It was a great stay, but I would advise that the bedroom closest to the street is a bit loud, as it is right over the street and some of the locals do enjoy riding their Harleys late at night. Not a deal breaker, but if you're a light sleeper I'd suggest sleeping in the interior room.
Otherwise, a great stay and Dan was very quick to respond and we had no issues during our stay."

The location is fantastic, right in the heart of downtown, making it super convenient to explore the area. It's close to excellent restaurants and just a short walk to the Saturday Farmers Market. Communication with the owners was excellent, and the lockbox check-in process was seamless. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenient and stylish place to stay in Des Moines. Looking forward to staying here again on my next visit!"

Another problem, no fault of host, big 52 foot Tractor / Trailer rig was on 4th street. right where we were trying to find garage at 1 am. We changed directions after coming around the block and was able to see the dark brown garage doors. Better directions might have helped. The truck blocked the checker board front building, which was what we were looking for.
A few maintenance issues were suggested, nothing major."

I didn’t like the automated messages- I got the check in and the check out messages back to back. And being told I needed to deliver a five star rating before I even had a chance to enter the place was not welcoming. I also didn’t like the inflexibility for check out when I asked to stay another couple of hours - even an hour - I was told no as the cleaner had to come five hours before the next guest checked in. Lastly, the mattress is really soft and not to my liking."

Our 2-year old had plenty of room to run around and the minimalist decor meant there were limited things for her to mess with.

We loved East Village and all of the awesome local shops and boutiques, sculpture park, dinner and Trivia Night at Quinton’s… and it was all a short drive or 15 min walk from the Penthouse.
The space itself is really fantastic. Beautifully appointed condo in a fantastic Art Deco building. Super high ceilings and gorgeous lighting, spacious layout and a pillow soft king size bed — it’s perfect in every way! And the garage parking with remote entry was a really nice touch as well.

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the nicest, cleanest AirBnBs we’ve stayed at. The building is historic, but the unit is thoroughly modern. Communication with the hosts was almost instantaneous. The location puts you steps away from the heart of Des Moines’ nightlife, and the views are expansive. The only caveat would be the same for any place downtown, in that a bit of urban din seeps in (though the train isn’t that close), especially on a Saturday evening. But it wasn’t intrusive, and the building itself is very quiet."

The bed is great, like sleeping on clouds and the bathrobes are so amazingly plushy too. We also found the cloffice a great idea. The location is perfect too in the center of the city, the Sushi place downstairs is really good and you can play ping pong and other games just across the street. Erica and Adessa are great hosts and they reply to your messages promptly. One of the best Airbnbs we've stayed at, we will come back whenever we're in or around Des Moines :)"

Stayed a few nights",Lovely space and comfortable bed. Beautiful neighborhood. Linda and Terry checked in several times to be sure I was comfortable and didn’t need anything. They were very welcoming. One thing to note is that there is a curtain between their kitchen and the private suite downstairs rather than a door. This didn’t bother me as I felt comfortable there and the bathroom and bedroom doors lock. But be aware in case you would not be comfortable with this. I would stay here again with no hesitation and recommend it.

I actively looked for opportunities to chat with her as I quickly sensed that we are kindred souls. I can honestly say that I have never felt more at home on this platform than during my stay with Linda. Again, the hospitality provided, coupled with the lively conversation and thoughtful gestures in the name of being a lovely human being, have me firmly placed in Linda's fan club."

Stayed a few nights","Terry was very nice. I didn't meet Linda in person, but she seemed nice in message. I only had two issues:
1. This is NOT a private unit as described. It's an open basement. There is no locked door between myself and the hosts, which made me uncomfortable.
2. The beds were VERY uncomfortable 😣. I got almost no sleep because the mattress caused me so much back pain. I even had to go get pain medicine and a massage after check out because my back was spasming so bad (I don't lije taking pills).
Linda & Terry, thank you for hosting us. We really do appreciate it. But can you please update your listing to reflect a room for rent, as it's not a private unit. Also, if you have the money, I would recommend replacing the mattresses, or at least adding a topper. Thanks!"

We were greeted with warm smiles and a very welcoming presence. Linda showed us around the house and always made sure that we were kept warm since the Airbnb can be cold. Linda offered us some cabbage soup, which was nice of her. The places in Iowa were 5–10 minutes away from the home, which was convenient. Overall, the listing and amenities matched the description. I would recommend staying here if you're in Iowa."

The room was clean, bed and mattress were great quality, bathroom was super clean, had warm and cold water, and toiletries.
Hosts speak and understand multiple languages including English.
The area is nice and quiet, close to gas station, local market, and lots of food options around.

The Airbnb itself was wonderful and very comfortable! The area was very spacious and clean. The bedroom was great with a cozy bed and a table to eat and do work. The restroom was very clean with fresh towels. In addition to the basic accommodations, this Airbnb had many additional amenities that distinguish it from others, this includes a small entertainment room with a TV and streaming services, access to the laundry room, and a small ""kitchen"" with mini fridge, microwave, and utensils. Lastly, the neighborhood and location of the Airbnb was so convenient! Downtown was only a 5-10 minute drive and access to the interstate was also very close by.
I'd also love to give a special shout out to Terry for being a wonderful host! Terry went above and beyond everyday to ensure I had a comfortable and pleasant stay. He always welcomed and greeted me with a smile. It was so great getting to know Terry throughout my stay with our conversations.
Thank you so much Terry, Linda, and Mylo (their dog) for a wonderful and memorable stay!"

Stayed about a week","Staying at South of Grand was the best decision we ever made in Des Moines. We were on the go most of the time visiting family and Terry/Lind were very sweet and accommodating. Our spaces were clean and comfortable and we felt very safe in the neighborhood. supplies were abundant in the bathroom and kitchenette. I think if you don't get to stay at ""South of Grand"" you'll regret it."

Stayed about a week","We were in Des Moines for an athletic event at the Iowa Events Center. It was an 8 minute drive to the venue.
Our hosts have the perfect setup for easy access and entry, while giving the guests their own space. The fridge and coffee maker setup are perfect for people like us, who get up early, eat a normal breakfast as we would eat at home, and get moving. Having a washer and dryer available was a plus with our longer stay."

Great place- the unit was spacious, clean and comfortable. You can tell that Linda & Terry put a lot of thought into the layout and take pride in maintaining it.
Great location- Greenwood Park is a block away. Multiple restaurants/bars only a few blocks away on Ingersoll. Easy driving access to downtown, the airport and I-235. A dedicated parking spot in the driveway is a plus.
Great overall experience!"

Great water pressure in the shower!! Just about anything you need for the shower - shampoo and conditioner, body wash, hair spray, the list just goes on and on.

The apartment was perfect and everything you could hope for in a “home away from home”. Their location is perfect and the space provided ample room and perfect amenities for our 6 night stay. It was very clean and comfortable. Terry was a gracious host and we enjoyed wine with him a couple of evenings as an enjoyable nightcap. They have a stencil on a wall in the apartment that reads something like “Come as guests, leave as friends”….and it’s true. Now that we’ve found this gem, we will always check for availability when we come back to Des Moines for a visit."

Their house is in a beautiful, tree-filled neighborhood only a ten-minute drive from downtown Des Moines. The place was extremely cozy and clean, with many thoughtful touches such as a clothes steamer and many toiletries. The only quirk to be aware of is that the ceilings are a bit low, which wasn’t an issue for us but might be noticeable if you are very tall. Linda and Terry were very warm and friendly, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks for a pleasant stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is in a perfect location, you can get to anywhere downtown within 5-10 mins! Linda & Terry had left for the weekend but checked in on us a few times to make sure we didn’t need anything and were warm enough. They had extra little heaters in the basement which was great! We love the little touches like the bathroom basket of misc items and the water stocked in the mini fridge & coffee kcups for us.
Only recommendation is this, yes the basement is private but it just that, a basement of a house. Foot steps and conversation from above can easily be heard. There is no door leading down to the basement just a curtain covering the door frame. We are two young girls and would have appreciated a locked door at the opening to the basement, especially because a man we didn’t know and wasn’t reviewed about on air bnb was “house sitting ” while Linda & Terry were gone."

Terry and Linda were traveling when I stopped by, but their friend Donnie was dog sitting and super accommodating and friendly. Yet even from afar, they did their best to resolve some issues I had with the wi-fi.

Linda made sure everything was comfortable and checked in several times to see if we needed anything else (which was impossible since she had already provided everything one could want in an Airbnb). The rooms are pretty spacious and feel completely separate from all the other living spaces in their house. We were able to come in and out with ease and Linda offered the perfect suggestions for entertainment and eateries. You’d be amiss to choose any place other than this. Much love for this couple and the ability to stay in their home.

Loved having the fridge and coffeemaker, which allowed us to save money and time on some meals. Clean, comfortable, quite space. Highly recommend!"

He showed us around and gave us a great recommendation for dinner so we could eat and watch the Packer game. That night, we hung out and enjoyed great privacy in the space. Everything was just as the pictures showed and made a very homey experience. They also answered all messages right away. If we are ever back in the area, my family will check if Linda and Terry's place is available. Great people and location."

Stayed with kids","Our family was only in town for a quick overnight stay. We were able to check in a little earlier than planned! I was needing to have a pack n play for our 2 year old and when I reached out to Jesse whether the house had one, he didn’t hesitate one bit, and had one ordered to arrive at the house the day we were set to arrive. It was beyond accommodating as it was one less big thing I had to pack. That little gesture meant a lot to our family.
Our kids LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the theater room and not for watching movies, but for going from level to level. It was a way for them to get energy out after a drive. The hot tub was a wonderful addition as well. There was space for our family of 7. Our bigger kids enjoyed sleeping in the theater, which gave us ample room to spread out the babies. It was also so nice to see a box fan that our kids used at night to drown out any baby cries. We are keeping this house on our list as we come to Des Moines quite often. Thanks again Jesse!"

Staying at Jesse’s was easy to find, Super Cute and many cool features! Felt at home and the movie room was our sons favorite! My husband had been driving so he hopped in the hot tub for a bit to relax and then we watched a scary movie together in the theater room! Our son loved the space theme room💙
Very cool and would definitely recommend!

The themed bedrooms are so cute, and the smart TVs were perfect for watching our favorite movies before bed. It was 90+ degrees during our stay so we didn’t use the hot tub, but it looked well kept. Highly recommend this place. We will definitely be staying here again!"
