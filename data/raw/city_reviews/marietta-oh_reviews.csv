Stayed with kids","Pros: Erin was very responsive. Quickest response time I’ve had with any host. My son left an item there and she made sure we got it back. She truly went above and beyond for us. The house was so clean! Not one thing was even slightly dirty. It was quite impressive. The neighborhood was very nice and we felt very safe there. There was tons of space. The back yard was fenced in and it was so cute and peaceful out there. There were plenty of towels and supplies. The bathrooms were especially clean and had great water pressure and stayed hot through several of us showering back to back.
Cons: The AC wasn’t working, but she quickly contacted someone to come look at it. It wasn’t able to be fixed immediately but she offered to bring us fans and made sure our stay was discounted. As stated in the description, the house is old so the floors creak a lot upstairs. It didn’t bother most of us but I am a light sleeper so it was difficult to sleep for me while others were up. The street is busy."

Group trip","This is a gorgeous old home in the heart of Marietta in a quiet neighborhood. You can walk almost anywhere in town from this location. Erin was a very responsive host who answered my emails in less than an hour (and usually sooner!) every time. We were there for a small family reunion and some stayed at Erin’s home while other’s stayed at the Lafayette. One of the things we really appreciated was that the kitchen was actually well stocked with silverware, plates, glasses, etc. We were able to order carry out the evening we arrived and not have to worry about having something to eat on and with! (There’s also a working dishwasher, which was very helpful.)
I highly recommend this home and this location."

Group trip",We had a fabulous time at Erin’s player piano home. We felt as if we were right at home as soon as we arrived. Coming back to Ohio from the Carolinas we enjoyed the architecture and detail of the home. We thoroughly enjoyed the Pianola in the evenings once returning from a busy day! The beds offered a comfy and peaceful nights sleep. The home was quite peaceful for a town location. Being close to restaurants and shopping topped off the convenience of the location. Erin was a sweet breath of fresh air and we enjoyed our quickly answered communication with her. We will always book Erin’s player piano home every visit to Marietta!

Stayed about a week","We are so glad we chose to stay at Erin’s beautiful home whilst visiting from the UK for a family wedding in Marietta.
Erin was always responsive to our many questions and went above and beyond to ensure our trip was great from start to finish. The property was the perfect location in a quiet, stunning neighbourhood.
A great space for our group of 5 with everything we could have needed.
Thank you again for your incredible hospitality and we hope to visit again in the future."

A cool house with a big personality, everyone had fun picking which bedroom they wanted. Wish it didn't rain so much over the weekend, we didn't get to spend any time in the backyard or relaxing on the front porch. Thanks again to Erin for being a great host."

Group trip","Excellent Airbnb. And who knew Marrietta was such a nice place to visit? The old downtown is super cool. The architecture everywhere nearby was so historic and interesting. We loved the Levee House Bistro and highly recommend the Scottish salmon, best salmon we have ever had. Back to the ABNB, it was so perfect for our party of three couples. No one had the any dissatisfaction. It really is a perfect place."

We messaged Erin and she responded immediately that the house was not impacted and provided us alternate routes to get there. The instructions to get in the house were easy, and the house was spacious with plenty of room for me and my husband and his elderly parents. Plenty of linens. Nice fenced backyard. Very close to everything in Marietta."

My family decided to meet in Marietta for vacation and we had a wonderful time staying at Erin's charming and spacious home! It was a very easy to find and we got settled in quickly.
It was very clean, comfortable, and inviting to stay there. The house was beautiful with intricate woodworking and details that made us feel like we went back in time. I love antiques and vintage and this house was full of great details. She did a fantastic job with her decorating. We had plenty of room and did not feel like we had to be quiet in order to not disrupt each other. The backyard was private and well fenced which was great for the dog to play in! It was nice to let her off leash safely.
The location was in a pleasant and quiet neighborhood and great for walking and exploring.
We have already discussed coming back next year to stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Enjoy a stay in Historic Downtown Marietta :) I grew up here, this downtown area has always been the “place to be” and it’s within walking distance of many nice things to do/places to eat.
This house is beautiful, nicely laid out with lots of bedrooms and a nice backyard area. My girls loved how it was decorated and we felt very much at home during our stay! There is a park and library right nearby and the local grocery stores are close as well.
Erin was kind and responsive, we didn’t need anything while we were there, the house was very well appointed… but she was also available if we had needed.
If you’re staying at Erin’s make sure to stop into All Pro Nutrition and grab a shake/goodie! It’s one of our favorite spots in town :)"

Stayed a few nights","this place was beautiful, it is by far the best place I've stayed. very beautiful home, everything about this place was amazing, so much nicer than the pictures show. Erin's home was very nice and very clean, it's very easy to get comfortable here, it even has a home gym. The neighborhood is very nice and is walking distance from restaurants and shopping, you can be downtown in just a few minutes. Erin was always very kind and friendly, very accommodating and easy to talk with. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back. a very good experience and I'm 100% satisfied. I can't believe that some people would pay just as much or even more to stay in a hotel, Erin's home is so spacious, you get a full home with a awesome fenced in back yard, all at a very reasonable price. all I can say is I loved it!!
if your ever in the Marietta area you should definitely check this place out.
thanks again Erin for sharing your beautiful home,,.... 😊"

Erin was helpful when we had questions about anything regarding the house. Neighbors were very nice and the neighbor was very safe and great for walking, lots of beautiful homes and churches. We had yo drive to restaurants but had a great experience every we went. The festival was a lot of fun and if go the fireworks show was the best we have ever seen. The house is older and much of the furnishing are as well but that added to the weekend for us."

Stayed with a pet","First of all, this place was stocked with care. Lots of linens, mountains of coffee pods, ample toilet paper and plentiful toiletries! While we didn't cook, I checked out the kitchen and had I wanted to prepare a full meal, all the needed pots and pans were there. We ate take out at the cute dining room table which seated four. There also are two very comfortable bar seats at the kitchen bar.
Second, this is a very dog friendly cottage. One of the porches has a gate up so guests can sit outside with their pup and there are no worries about their dog dashing off the porch in pursuit of a squirrel. There's also a fenced in yard, pet bowls & poop bags, and a crate that probably could house a medium sized dog comfortably.
We walked all around Harmar but enjoyed strolling along the river (which is less than 2 blocks away) the most. It's also easy to cross the bridge to walk around/dine in downtown Marietta!"

The laundry was a huge gift for when the kids got muddy picking apples about 15 minutes away. The location meant we were about a 10 minute walk to the main strip of Marietta (or a 3 minute drive). Busy Bee was an awesome restaurant in walking distance. Just walking along the river was beautiful. We had a really wonderful time at Emily's and hope to come back next fall.

Stayed with kids","Jennifer's house, ""The Upperclassman"" was the perfect place for our family to stay during our trip to Marietta. Impeccably clean! High quality finishes, stylish furnishings, and thoughtful touches throughout. While the home is historic, it has been completely renovated with all the modern conveniences (high end appliances, beautifully tiled showers, on trend high quality lighting and bathroom fixtures). The private fenced -in backyard was quiet and peaceful, a safe space for families of children of all ages. The location of the house makes walkability to the riverfront, shops, restaurants, and outdoor events (farmers market and outdoor live music ) a breeze. We absolutely loved our stay! We hung out in the upper game room quite a bit and found it cozy and comfortable. The TV's were easy to use as they already had basic cable AND were also smart TV's so we could log into our streaming apps as well. We can't wait to come back and stay at the Upperclassman again soon! Highly recommend!"

I just had never used a lock like they have. I assumed that once I punched the code in, I would just need to click the door handle. I think it would be helpful for others if they knew that they had to turn the key lock part first before trying to open the door using the thumb unlock to open the door.
Once we were able to get inside their beautiful home, our accommodations were perfect! We all absolutely loved and thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations at this gorgeous home! We are already planning a trip back to the area when the weather is warmer!"

It felt like we were in our home. Beautiful rooms all up and down the home. Great energy and spirit to the home. Comfortable beds, warm and welcoming kitchen, spacious bathrooms, and the fire pit in the backyard is very relaxing. Although most of the seat cushions are dirty and, some, have mold on the seats, because of the falling leaves mixed with rain of course. However, we were still able to enjoy the outdoor setting in the evening. This home, location, even the businesses and people around the area, made this a great experience for me and my family. Would highly recommend and look forward to one day, soon, visiting and staying here again."

(As a brand new listing that has been recently remodeled, the owners are still putting finishing touches on a couple of rooms.) The location cannot be beat, with easy access to outdoor experiences, historical sites, and local shopping! For nature enthusiasts, there is a bike/walking trail that goes along the river (across the street), and an outdoor adult gym and arboretum are within walking distance. The Ohio Riverboat Museum across the street is also well-worth checking out! It provides an account of the rich history of Marietta and the makings of Ohio River towns. Local shops in Marietta's historic downtown are just a few minutes' drive down the street. What a fantastic find!"

Our dog loved it just as much as we did. The kitchen is awesome, the space overall feels like a second little home away from home. We cannot wait to come back! If the wind agrees we'll definetely be using the bikes in the shed to check out more of Marrietta! Awesome local shops in walking distance and the 740 social I think is what it was called, but it's a restaurant right around the corner. If you like Mussels go there! chip also reccomended another great seafood spot nearby but I can't recall it. Ask him, he's very nice. The foam Garage downstairs had some awesome music over the weekend, not to loud, but not overpowering. Just loud enough to vibe to taylor swift in the hallway! Also almost all of the local shops are are dog friendly so don't be afraid to bring your furry family! Can't wait to go back up!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved this flat! The enclosed shower was terrific, wish I could get one for our home. The kitchen was new and modern. Chip and Marianella have put a lot of thought into this place. It is located in the heart of downtown and is quiet place to stay. One draw back was the mattess, which is a little firm to my liking and the pillows were generic. I was not expecting luxe but a little more comfort. My husband and I actually met Chip and he is a wonderful guy with a lot of information about Marietta and recommendations. He was very responsive when we needed something. Do not let the parking area discourage you. We will definitely book again if it is available."

Stayed about a week","My wife and I stayed one week in this clean and comfortable, uncluttered upstairs apartment. The three rooms were adequate, kitchen was good with basic necessities. The bed is on a low platform, comfortable with a large dresser, closet and quiet fan. Large TV with fine Bose surround sound and comfortable couch and a small writing desk. Enjoyed the shower. Off street parking space, 26 outside steps to apt. The hosts were personable and responsive. The Foam space was not intrusive. The street is one way with an easy walk (on biking/walking trail) to the Point and the Lafayette Hotel, the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers. The town is easily walkable and close by and the Kroger store within a couple of miles."

We detoured along 4th Street when we headed to the riverboat. The architecture of the houses along this street was worth the extra walking time. Since the apartment is on the third floor, this is not the place for you if you have difficulty with steps. Chip and Marianella gave us suggestions of things to do and places to eat. They are very helpful. We will definitely stay again if we are back in Marietta."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great love nest or hang-out pad right downtown. Shower is amazingly luxurious, high-tech touches, marble counter-tops in kitchen, great sound system and TV, comfortable bed and furniture, very nicely decorated. Very walkable location, secure.
You are downtown, so you will hear early morning sounds like dumpster being emptied. Also, there is a large AC unit hanging on the building wall, outside the bedroom, so you will hear the fan running most of the time (didn't bother us at all, not loud, just persistent). During the day, you may hear the sound of children squealing in laughter from the Foam Playroom below.
Parking is on the side of the building, plenty of room off of the street, and the metal stairway up is secure, solid. Other cars will pass by your parked car in order to access the two spaces behind it."

While they describe it as ""downtown"" so that you'll have to deal with some noise, we've not found it to be an issue in either of our stays. You can tell there are people around and the occasional loud pickup goes down the street, but the noise level didn't interfere with work or sleep."

Located right in downtown Marietta, it's just blocks or a short walk along a greenway to just about everything including the nightlife, restaurants, museums, Saturday Farmers Market, collage and other attractions. It would be totally wrong to judge this property by its exterior. It is a modern, thoroughly appointed loft with all the amenities. We were very impressed by how attractively appointed, clean and comfortable our two night stay was. On a summer weekend the urban noise level was no more than a few people enjoying the evening at the small outdoor seating at the Moose Lodge next door."

Stayed one night","Until recently, visiting my hometown has always been a little difficult because there are so few places to stay that are cozy. So finding Chip and Marianella's downtown loft apartment has been the greatest discovery. Downtown Marietta is one of the greatest parts of coming ""home."" It's colorful and thriving, with new businesses emerging all the time. And the loft is located in the heart of it all.
Check-in was a breeze. Chip and Marianella were so warm and welcoming. And the loft is perfect: clean, charming, well-appointed, comfortable. I was only able to spend one night, but have already shared the listing with a couple of close hometown friends who appreciate the historic charm of Marietta but no longer call the town home. Being able to go ""home"" and stay somewhere so lovely makes visiting all the greater. I'll definitely be saving this as a favorite for a future visits, of which there'll now likely be more."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely amazing. What an apartment!! So close to everything in Marietta. C&M were wonderful hosts that we actually got to speak with several times. Great sized living room, large tv, wonderful sound system, built in wall fireplace with different color flames, and large couch. The kitchen was adorable, we admired how up to date all appliances were, excellent coffee maker with coffee AND cream for us to use, fridge that dispenses water and ice and plenty of storage room, separate wine cooler (the host delivered us wine too!), and a little breakfast bar/counter. The room was beautiful decorated, bed was comfortable, you could smell detergent on both the freshly washed sheets and the comforter and I thought that was very comforting myself. The bathroom was gorgeous with a large shower that had several options rain, hand held, mist, you could play music in there. The AC was on the wall and you could make it so wonderfully cool as well. You do have to walk up stairs to get to the apartment but it is no big deal. The bike path runs just by the apartment, and a short short walk to the river. The river is gorgeous as well. The town was bustling with people and so many delicious options. What a gorgeous place with kind and helpful hosts."

If you need a place to stay in Marietta this loft is a must!!!

From check in to check out it was a pleasure. Some places have a check out list of things you need to do that spans 2 pages, this one was so short I forgot to put the towels in the shower, sorry. The apartment is well equipped if you plan on cooking, everything is pretty new and so works well. Towels are super plush, so much so that I need to do some towel shopping for my own home.
The location is right next to the riverfront path, great for walking, running, biking. Our last night here we visited with Chip and Marianella for a few hours and had a great time. Really special people with hearts of gold."

Their place is impressively well put together with modern features that are complimented by cozy touches of home. It’s as centrally located as you could possibly get with many of the town staples just outside the door step. I especially enjoyed my stroll through the Saturday farmers market just a three-minute walk away. A quiet and comfortable stay. I appreciated the attention they paid to cleaning and sanitizing, and presenting everything in a very user friendly fashion. The board games were a nice touch, too. Also! Be sure to ask Chip and Marianella to plug you into the places where the locals hang. All around great experience in a nice loft hosted by cool humans. I’d have stayed another night had they not been booked. You should do it, too :)."

Caroline was a fantastic host and great ambassador for her town. Beautiful fresh cut flowers and the most delicious homemade scones awaited us when we got there. If you’re looking for a boring, modern place, this isn’t it. Its full of life and character. If we’re ever back in Marietta, we know exactly where we are staying."

We've stayed at the Blennerhassett Hotel in the past, but as we have used AirBNBs on our other trips, we thought we'd see what was offered locally. What a wonderful surprise! We've enjoyed exploring Harmar Village in the past, so it was a treat to be able to stay there. As designers, we really appreciate the amazing architecture and interior space of the building. And, having the decor being chock full of historical memorabilia was a super nice touch. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be sure to book on our next trip if it's available."

Bed was comfortable. Livingroom seating was comfortable. Kitchen well equipped. Would definitely stay here again! There were a few opportunities to improve the experience: There is only one night stand in each bedroom. If you and your spouse both need a nightstand for book, CPAP, water, etc., it is challenging. If you are someone who likes a lot of light, bring a small task light or reading light. There is no overhead lighting in the living room, only two small lamps. Great for watching TV. A little too dark to read in the evening. Overall, great experience!"

It was clean, comfortable, quiet with plenty of space. Offstreet parking made us comfortable, leaving a bicycle on the back of our car. Jessie was more than accommodating! We traveled 14 hours to find our way to this Airbnb and she added a night for us at the last minute. Jessie was Incredibly flexible and responsive. We were grateful for the opportunity to stay here and be close enough to friends to visit in Marietta. The beds are incredibly comfortable and we slept very well. The living room is perfect for the end of the day post travel rest that we needed.
I can confidently recommend this Airbnb to any travelers needing a comfortable place to stay."

Each room had Roku TVs and there were some games in the living room, too, so we spent plenty of time lounging around the house as well as going out and exploring. The checkout instructions were included in a checklist which was really helpful when trying to get on the road with two toddlers. Would stay again and definitely recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","My family enjoyed our stay. It was family and toddler-friendly and since the downstairs has hardwood floors and easily wipeable services we didn't have to worry about minor spills that toddlers may have. I preferred the on-street parking to the driveway as the drive is on the side as opposed to in front by the steps and door so it was easier to load and unload from the front (this will make sense once you're there). Jessi left brochures and guides so if you haven't planned anything to do, you can find things while you're there. The house was really cute and welcoming and provided plenty of space for my husband and me to stay with our son and his family. And the beds were so comfortable that we slept amazingly well. I would definitely stay again and the toddler gave it her nod of approval."

Stayed a few nights","This house was the perfect size for our short three day trip to Marietta and much better than a hotel. However, the house is older, so it had some quirks such as squeaky floors, bedroom doors that do not close all the way, a few broken window panes, stiff handle on the front door, etc. Overall, we enjoyed our stay; but, there were a few things we found odd and/or inconvenient. The living room only had one small lamp, making it hard to see if you wanted to read or do something else besides watch TV. There is also only one end table in the living room on the far end of the couch. A small coffee table would be ideal, so the people sitting in the middle of the couch or the opposite end can have a place to put their drinks. The half bathroom upstairs has no outlets, and the outside seating area in the side yard was not guest ready having dirty cushions. Some areas we could tell had not been cleaned in a while. A thick amount of dust on one dresser and a lot of dust and debris by the couch."

Consider Jessi’s Airbnb.
Perfect three bedroom home for a family to stay in. In our case, two sisters driving our Snowbird folks, age 87 and 90 home to Ohio from Florida. Since Covid, we have found Airbnbs much better of accommodations than hotels, when it comes to avoiding cooties.
Highly recommend.

We really enjoyed the vibe of the house and it is by far one of our favorite air bnbs we have stayed at! The house is very clean and welcoming and is in a pretty neighborhood. We also love that we could bring our dogs along too! ❤️ We loved our time there and feel well rested! It’s a gem!

We hated to leave.

Jessi was a fantastic host and has the house set up to be very welcoming and relaxing and had everything we needed!The house was extremely clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed the big sectional couch in the living room which was very comfortable and clean. The front porch is new and was the perfect place to enjoy our morning coffee or evening wind down. The house is in a great location and close to the hospital on a quiet dead end street with very nice neighbors. The bed I slept in was very comfortable. The water pressure in the shower was also good! The entire house has been freshly painted, new tile in the kitcken, the beautiful hardwood floors that run through the first floor bedrooms, living room and dining room have been newly refinished. The carpet upstairs is also new! This was a great house and we cant wait to come back for our next visit!"

Stayed one night","Simple/basic but charming room--it is basically a hotel room set-up, with bedroom + bath + mini-fridge in a quiet but charming neighborhood. At least on the weekend when I rented, it was very affordable for a real b&b deal (as others have mentioned, the owners include a gift card for the delicious and delightful ""Busy Bee"" restaurant around the corner). There are many points of interest and several other good restaurants in the neighborhood, too (I had a delicious eggplant parm at Spagna's, just up the block). Only reasons I gave <5 for anything was that, even though the owners have done good reno work, it is obviously an old building and is missing a few creature comforts and you walk through a slightly creepy hallway to get from the front door to the room. With that said, I'd pay for a simple charming room in a quirky historic neighborhood/building over a boring corporate hotel any day! This is a great find!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This room is in a neat old building that is in an area with a lot of activity. There is an obvious move to revitalize the area, and it is neat to see.
You can walk right out the door, and down to the river! There is a path that follows the river for walking or biking, and if you want to go across the river, the bridge is one block away. There are numerous restaurants one block away, or more across the river. All of them are within walking distance.
Parking is easy right outside on the street, and the neighborhood feels very safe. It is very quiet! Take a walk around - there are some amazing houses right around the corner!
Check-in was easy with the code on the doors, and Larry's instructions were clear.
The room was what I would call hobo-chic. There's no pretense of trying to make it look like a high-end suite with the construction. It is very clean and neat. The decor is very tasteful and comfortable. The bathroom had fantastic lighting, and the water pressure in the shower/tub was great.
In an attempt to be environmentally aware, I'm sure, there are not a lot of extra towels available. I don't blame him because whatever is in the room will have to be washed, used or not, so why be wasteful. However, Larry is quick to respond to your questions and requests, so don't be afraid to ask for more of anything.
He included a $10 gift card for the restaurant around the corner for breakfast. Don't throw that away! The restaurant is wonderful!"

Harmar Village is a safe, historic area with both established and new businesses within easy walking distance. Larry offered helpful suggestions for places to eat - we tried them all and they were great! A nice surprise was a gift card to the Busy Bee where the food is from local sources, the portions are huge and the service great - a must try. It's an easy walk over the bridge to Marietta. We enjoyed walking both neighborhoods, exploring shops and checking out the beautiful architecture and local history. Larry was easy to communicate with and very accommodating. I highly recommend, and would definitely stay again if in the area."

My husband enjoyed the Keurig coffee that was there, and Judy included a helpful information sheet on backing out of her driveway (it's a little curvy and on a hill!). The bed was too soft for our liking, but that is definitely a matter of personal taste! Unfortunately, the apartment was just not as clean as we expected it to be with the ""sparkling clean"" ratings and reviews. There was dust in a number of visible places, smudges on the mirror, some dirt on some of the walls...probably nothing a good spring cleaning wouldn't help with! Overall, we had a pleasant overnight stay, and I hate to leave a less-than-5 star review. But I would have liked to have known to anticipate a less-than-sparkling-clean place as I looked at reviews before booking."

Stayed one night","Judy's place is great. The apt is as nice, and maybe even nicer, than the pix. It's a short drive to downtown Marietta and to a cool Covered Bridges route. I could see it being a great place to stay for a few days to explore the area.
I had asked beforhand if the driveway was large enough for me to turn around since I was pulling a trailer with my car. It turns out the driveway is one way on a hill, and I wouldn't have booked the place if I knew this. Judy was great about helping me leave -first trying to guide me down and then, when that failed, calling her son to lend a hand. She was such a great hostess to go above and beyond like that.
I highly recommend this place."

We love the nice large bathroom and shower that has great pressure and nice hot water. The walk-in closet has great places to unpack luggage and hang clothes. The couch is very comfortable and a little dining table is just the right size for two people. It’s nice to have a full sized fridge. The full size bed was a little soft for me, but the linens are soft and comfy."

Stayed a few nights","This was my 5th AirBnB stay, (If I remember right) and my best. The apartment was absolutely perfect, through & through. The kitchen was stocked with everything, even ice and the cold packs to use in your cooler, coffee, creamer, snacks, water, and so much more. The living room had a very comfy
couch, tv, with DVDs, cable, all you would need to keep you occupied.
The bed was super comfy, slept great. There is a utility room, with an iron & ironing board, and plenty of space to hang your clothes if more long term. The bathroom is wonderful, and well stocked, even a blow dryer, and scales.
There's also a small table with 2 chairs to eat at, in an open concept floor plan. It was super clean, and nicely decorated. It's a little out of town, but just a short drive. I saw more of Marietta than I ever have, being off the main drag. There's no steps to worry about, good even for the elderly. The shower is elderly friendly.
I'd love to stay there anytime I'm in Marietta. A great find."

Stayed one night","This is one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed at and we stayed at many. It is a warm and inviting space. The brown tones and squared off but open space design, plus the arrangement and ease of everything made us feel right at home. A balance of helping us feel grounded and a feeling of space around us after traveling for awhile. Slept so well! Spacious enough to do yoga in the morning. My only regret is that we didn’t have a reason to be there more than one night. It was so cozy. I can see all the thought and love that Judy put in to the creation of this space herself. It kind of reminded me of the IKEA showrooms—I always wondered what it would be like to stay in one of those spaces. For us, it was a bit difficult to find the entrance to driveway at night. Hopefully, that may change. We enjoyed wandering Marietta; and she is 5 minutes away from a very significant Earthworks Mounds. If ever we travel through there again, we will definitely keep RoadRunner’s Haven in mind! And we will let others know! The name suits it well."

stocked kitchen. Not much closet space to hang clothes. We were aware that it was on the third floor. However it was a challenge to get our things to the third floor. Some sort of a dumb waiter or wheeled cart would have been very helpful. It’s clear to see there is still work in progress in the building, but things were cleaned up and put away. The bonus was being downtown where we were able to walk to so many attractions and to the rivers. Our visit was for 3 nights. I would return but will definitely travel lighter."

Group trip","The six of us were in town for a wedding and it was the perfect place. Being in that old historic building was absolutely beautiful. I've always been a history buff and staying in a place and town with such history was awesome. People should remember when booking that this building is old... everything creaks... there's a lot of stairs... so don't book it and cry when you're in an old building. The kitchen and the bathrooms were updated and very nice. The furniture and high celings were charming and the place had such a great open feel. The town was hopping with tons to do within a couple blocks. The little deli downstairs, the Galley restaurant around the corner and the taco place Spanglish right on the river were all awesome. There was a little wine bar by the galley that was a ton of fun with great music as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. we had a blast."

The space itself is stunning and has become our home away from home while visiting family in Marietta. The location is ideal - close to the river, restaurants and shops. We walked everywhere and often walked just for fun. Our group was holding an event at the nearby Galley / Adelphia Room and rented all three of Maxx’s units (the Flat on Front and the Shopping District Apt) and they were all charming, comfy, and beautifully restored. We would highly recommend any of Maxx”s properties to a prospective guest and look forward to future visits with this first-class host."

Group trip","This is a beautiful, newly renovated old ballroom that fits seamlessly into the charming historical environment of downtown Marietta while providing all the modern amenities and comfort you wish for. Step out of the building and you're already within sight of most of the downtown attractions. You also have a market right below you if you need to stock up on any food or drinks for the room. If you're spending any time in Marietta with multiple couples, this becomes a better economic decision than rooms at The Lafayette or The Hackett while still having that high standard of accommodations and convenience of being in the center of a great walking neighborhood. I spend a couple of weekends in Marietta every year and we're already talking about staying here again."

Right downtown walkable to everything we wanted to do. Lots of space for a bigger group which is a nice option instead of a hotel when our family comes to town.
The tv and/or internet was kind of slow and was confusing to figure out (had to get the Roku remote from our bedroom to get it to work in the living room). The couches were huge and crazy comfortable.
It was surprisingly quiet with the building being so old and having other apartments down the hall."

Stayed with kids","The Ballroom is lovely! It is the perfect combination of authentically historic and comfortably convenient. Our group enjoyed daily walks from the ideal downtown location; tasty meals and treats at McKennas (right downstairs!), the Galley, Marietta Brewing Co, and the Busy Bee - all walking distance; homemade meals in the Ballrooms gourmet kitchen, and settling in to the comfy beds looking up at the beautiful antique tin ceiling imagining the folks who’d been in the ballroom hundreds of years before us. The renovated shower is spotless and spacious and we enjoyed the convenience of having the additional powder room at the top of the stairs. The upstairs loft was great fun for our kiddo and our biggest problem is now he wants a loft bedroom back at home.
Maxx is a kind and knowledgeable host who has thought of everything one might need to feel both special and at home. We loved our time in Marietta at the Historic Ballroom and would recommend it to family and friends without reservation."

The beds are very comfy and main bathroom had plenty of towels. The location of the apartment is great to walk around town to shop and eat. The apt made all four of us adults feel at home that after we got done eating we went back to watch the OSU game in the Spacious and comfy living room. We came down to Marietta to see the “Big Bucket” (1 hr drive) and did the “ Valley Gem SternWheeler Boat” tour. Which I would highly recommend.

They gave us so many great recommendations of businesses, restaurants, activities, and more in and around town. They knew we were on the hunt to buy a house, so they helped us by giving us some details about the different parts of town. If we had a question or concern, they were always immediately available by phone, and could be on site in just a couple minutes.
We stayed there over a month. The surrounding neighbors and community welcomed us with open arms. We couldn't have asked for a better start to our lives in Marietta. What a beautiful historic little river city!"

As we were staying longer than 1 week, Toni also came in once per week to do some light cleaming of the property. There were a few problems with one of the heaters, but Toni was very responsive and we usually had these fixed within 30 minutes, so it never affected out experience. Would highly recommend this property"

There’s a large backyard, a nice laundry room complete with laundry supplies, and the shower had awesome water pressure. The beds are comfortable, and the apartment is very well put together. I would definitely stay again."

Everything was very clean and the king bed was quite comfortable. The location is ideal. It is in a quiet area but also very close to a tasty BBQ place. It is also walking distance to a number of other restaurants and taverns, and close enough to the bridge to be able to walk to the other side of Marietta. Toni was also a gracious host and easily in contact with us when need be. We would certainly stay again!"

The kitchen is large, which was great for us since we cooked a Christmas meal without people tripping over each other. And most importantly, the hosts are responsive.

Stayed one night","This home was absolutely stunning from top to bottom. I came in town for a wedding with my 3 kids and MIL. I picked this home because of the bunk beds and option to have a pack n play & highchair for the youngest child (a lot of airbnbs don’t have these as options). Ultimately those were my decision makers! I was part of the bridal party so I needed an early check in, after communicating my needs to James & Daphne they were quick to respond and to help with a solution on getting us checked in early so I could enjoy the day with the bride! All of us had an amazing experience inside and outside (fenced in yard is a MAJOR plus with kids!) If I’m back in the area for a stay I will most certainly look up James & Daphne. Wonderful hosts!"

This house is set up well for families AND adults (if you are not traveling with children it is relaxing and inviting for an adult trip yet safe and laid out well for children)The fenced-in level backyard with a play-set/ swing set was the perfect place for our family to unwind and spend time together. James and Daphne's house is a rare item in Marietta, let alone the Mid Ohio Valley. As a former long time resident of Marietta who has moved out of state and comes back to town from time to time I was THRILLED to see THIS house, in THIS neighborhood, become available as an Airbnb... I have known this house and neighborhood for years and their are few to little houses in Marietta that have this type of neighborhood and modern home layout. James and Daphne were very responsive and professional hosts. We can't wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","The hosts were very accommodating and responsive. The decor was very nice and the master bedroom had a wonderful steam shower.
Unfortunately for the owners the cleaning crew did the bare minimum.... which was not the owners fault and to which they responded immediately and were gracious to discount the stay.
The toilet in the guest bath along with the bathtub had not been cleaned. And I found out later by another lady that was with our group that she had to clean out the microwave... the oven was dirty, and someone had left milk and eggs along with a dirty fridge.
I do feel bad for the owners as I believe they do pay a cleaning service which did them a huge disservice. So with that being said if I knew that it had been properly cleaned I would stay there in a heart beat because it is obvious the owners have worked hard on that place!
The owners were very gracious when one of the elderly ladies tripped on a step and a glued piece came completely off the ledge!"

They were thoughtful of us arriving late, so they left the back porch light on for us. The home was exactly as pictured. The neighborhood was quiet, and definitely had the ""country living"" vibe. The beds were comfy, and the 2 bathrooms came in handy with having 2 pre teens in the group. The kitchen had everything you needed to cook your meals. The living room area was cozy to watch movies snuggled up, although the internet was down, Sarah attempted to get it serviced, but my hotspot kept us afloat. It was a peaceful New Years Eve, as we wanted. It was great to be out the city, in hidden in the country to enjoy each other. There was salt for the stairs due to the snow that arrived on our last day. Sarah was accommodating to a let us check out a little later due to the holiday. She gave suggestion on hidden gems, we'll be back!"
