Stayed a few nights","Donald has a great small place here. it's clean, with a great kitchen, living room, bathroom, even a dog bed. it's a real gem, quiet and small town all the way. it was a little tough to find, it's in the alley behind the house. Rockwood is small, no grocery store, so bring your steak and eggs! That said the kitchen is well stocked, with spices and extras that was super nice to find. If this sounds like you already, go have a great weekend."

Stayed with a pet","Don’s tiny house is more like a modern spacious loft. Husband and I visited with our dogs for a wedding in Delaware. The location was perfect for us, there were lots of places to take dogs on walks and we felt right at home. Don was very responsive and helped us when we had trouble finding the house. We got there late at night after a 10 hour drive and he was so kind and called us to help. The kitchen has everything you need and then some and the bedroom and bathroom upstairs are so cool! We loved our stay and if we are ever back in the area, we hope Don will host us again!"

Stayed a few nights","Donald's, tiny home is more of a loft apartment than a true tiny home which in my opinion makes it even better. It's basically, a garage converted to an ADU and well done at that. There was plenty of room to move about and a nice kitchen. The town is small, peaceful, and everyone we met was very kind and friendly. A great location in the heartland of Ohio."

It had everything I needed and I felt very comfortable. Donald was very easy to work with and accommodating, as I decided to bring along my dog at the last minute. I didn't get a chance to do much walking or exploring since the weather was cold and snowy, but I would definitely choose to stay there again if the need arose. All in all, a great experience!"

Stayed a few nights","A nice place to stay! It was clean and didn’t feel all that small for a tiny home. There is a nice pond/park nearby that we took our dogs for a walk. If the weather wasn’t so cold, our daughter could have played on the equipment there too. We visited the local antique shop and Wildcat pizza - both were good! We spent our afternoon at the Columbus Zoo and it was only 30 min away. Great location for us since we didn’t want to pay big city prices. The only negative thing I would say would be that the bottom floor was chilly because the front door let in a lot of cold air when closed."

Kitchen stocked with all appliances. Quiet neighborhood and a cute balcony to sit outside on the second floor. I had a question and Donald not only answered quickly but also stopped by to make sure I had it figured out. Every room was clean. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. I completely enjoyed my stay. The local Wildcat pizza place has great food!!

Stayed a few nights","I don't think I've ever had as pleasant a stay as I did in Don's AirBNB. The pictures and description are accurate, but really don't do justice to the comfort and luxurious experience of staying in this tiny house. The kitchen is incredible; everything is spotless and shining. It really is a perfect getaway for a quiet weekend or a cozy romantic escape from the world. Richwood is a quiet rural town with some local wineries worth visiting, but largely off the beaten path. Don is a superb host--friendly, helpful, responsive, very easy to contact. He's thought of everything to make the house comfortable--you'll feel so spoiled. Don't miss the chance to enjoy this lush corner of Ohio and Don's outstanding hospitality."

There is every little detail within. It is so well taken care of and immaculately clean. Everything was well maintained. It was perfect and pristine.
The one thing that isn’t mentioned is that this past week we stayed and there was filtered water on the refrigerator. We never know what to expect and brought our water with us. That was a nice surprise!
I wish every place we stayed was as nice as this one. We’d like to visit and stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect! We enjoyed our stay. We have stayed before and plan to again. It is that great. Beats a hotel any day and the price is well worth it. I rarely give reviews, but I know they can be helpful. So if you are looking for something that is clean, comfortable, private, peaceful, beautiful, and priced well, this is it. Thankful this is available. Thank you, Kathy! You are an excellent host. May the Lord bless you with excellent guests and for it to always be a joy to you."

Stayed a few nights","What a sweet little hidden gem! My mom and I booked The Barn VERY last minute when we decided to go to a nearby fair. And I'm so glad we did! The barn is just lovely! It's quiet, peaceful, clean, and minimal in the best way! The kitchenette isn't meant for cooking Thanksgiving dinner (nor should it be!) - it's perfect for storing and preparing a few snacks/leftovers/drinks - exactly what you need on vacation! The upstairs is cozy and spotless. We slept like logs!
Since our trip was so short, we only saw Kathy and John once, but they were as kind as could be! I read another review where someone said bumping into them was like bumping into friends, and I totally get it!
There are goats, chickens, rabbits, and cats on the property, but I PROMISE you the shared spaces do not smell like animals, you don't hear them, and the place is so clean that you could almost forget they're there! Or, if you're like me, you can talk to them like a goober and maybe even pet a goat!"

Photos of the full-size bed, situated directly against a wall on one side, told us in advance one of us would likely sleep on the twin-size “sofa/daybed”—rather than disturb each other getting up during the night. The daybed was comfortable, with linens provided in crates underneath. Wonderful bath towels. The main level kitchenette was bright, clean, and spacious. The half-bath off the kitchenette area is a definite plus! Our experience was ideally private, with no encounters other than goats, rabbits, and chickens—which we sought out."

They have thought of everything for their guests, such as an informative binder that explains how to get on the internet and what is available in the area, nice towels, very clean. The animals are definitely an added bonus for those who want to go see them. Nice of the hosts to share them!

Only thing is in the photos they show a bed and it looks like there is possibly another place for someone to sleep and I would just say plan on sharing the bed. My friend and are thankfully comfortable enough to share a bed with one another but if you are thinking you could sleep on that other bed I would not! Just for sitting. Also if you are chunky like me and get hot easily I would bring a fan. Other than that it was a good stay :) we had a great time visiting!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at this quaint and peaceful farmhouse barn space. The place was very clean and the host answered all of our questions quickly, within minute, which we really appreciated!
The only heads up we would give is to families traveling with a young child that it will require some improvisation. For example, there wasn't a tub, so we did wipe downs with a wet washcloth for our kiddos. And since there wasn't a washer or dryer on site, so diaper accidents or spitups/vomit may also be something worth planning ""worst case scenario"" for. We handwashed a few linen in the sink and airdried it outside and that also worked well. There wasn't a highchair, so we fed baby in our lap. There wasn't a stove, so we had to think through meals and snacks carefully. Our littles loved the rooster crowing and it was a treat seeing the goats being fed!
Absolutely beautiful property, and we would definitely come stay here again next time we pass through.
Thank you, Ashley!"

Kitchen well organized and stocked with some Keurig coffee, snacks and beverages. Janel had an extensive notebook of points of interest and places to dine in the area. We were there to observe the total eclipse, and mainly ate in the cabin, but I did make a stop at 8 Sisters Bakery on way home. The location of the cabin was only a couple of miles from Mount Gilead, and maybe 15 miles from Marion. Several parks in area.
Great porch to relax on, as well as a fire ring out amongst the trees with chairs. Living room is large, two couches and a chair. Huge non-functioning but very interesting stone fireplace on end.
The bedrooms are small, but that comes with the rustic nature of the place. Clean bed linens and towels. Plenty of blankets and pillows.
A great escape and place of solitude from the hectic pace of modern life"

Awesome selection of games to choose from. She even has noise makers in the bedrooms, and fans! (I love a good white noise when I sleep).
The peaceful surroundings with some bird seed and feeder off back was the best! We spent an hour each morning just watching the silly birds. We even got to see deer and chipmunks!!!
Home was impeccable and decorated wonderfully!
Marion is our home town (live in FL now) so we make the trip often. We have now found our home away from home. Thank you Janel for opening up your space for us. I’m glad you went with your vision and created this experience for all to enjoy on Airbnb!

Stayed with kids","Janel’s place was FABULOUS. We hosted our family for Christmas here, and the place came fully decorated. It was so cozy and festive. The cottage feels very secluded and private but also just a couple minutes from amenities and local shops and restaurants in town. We hosted a big family dinner and the kitchen was surprisingly well equipped for an Airbnb. The place reminded us of Airbnb’s from years ago when hosts cared about their guest’s experience. We’re coming back next year."

Stayed with a pet","My husband and i wanted to get away for our 51st wedding anniversary and felt we were very lucky to find this place, It was a wonderful place to get away from it all, and just relax in the beautiful peaceful setting in this very clean , comfortable lovely cottage. We enjoyed visiting nearby, Mount Gilead, and also Marion, Ohio. It was wonderful that at this place they had a large fenced in area for our dogs to play. Also, the cottage was very well equipped, and we found nothing lacking. We have been staying in Airbnb‘s for almost 15 years and this is one of the nicest I think we have ever stayed in. We would love to come back and highly recommend it!
Only one problem with our visit.. we didn’t stay long enough!"

We had a small issue last year and she responded quickly, kindly and generously. She creates a comfortable space where you feel at home and is generously accommodating. The fire pit area is wonderful with comfortable seats and wood provided (so nice !!). The details are everywhere - drink holder stands at the fire, an active bird feeder at the patio door, the encouraging decor, and local honey for sale in the kitchen. Close to the state park- always worth the visit. The cabin is Quiet, peaceful and comfy. We just know our stay will be just great. Highly recommend Janel and Whetstone woods."

We were greeted in the mornings by a momma doe grazing in the yard while her twin fauns did zoomies around her. Janel was so easy to communicate with and provided tons of local information for stores, food, and things to do. We were in town to celebrate my sister’s birthday and Janel went above and beyond to make her day special. We would absolutely recommend this cabin. Especially if you’re looking for a quiet getaway."

The cabin was even nicer than it looks in the photos. The public spaces are big and airy, with lovely decor. With so many windows, it feels as though you're being held in the arms of the woods, in the best way possible! During the day, the forest is filled with Birdsong, and at night you are serenaded by frogs.
Janel was an extremely responsive and helpful host, offering suggestions for local adventures, and providing detailed instructions for getting into the cabin. We were also provided with snacks, which was a really lovely and unexpected touch. (Thank you!)
All in all, an amazing place! I would love to stay here again."

Ten feet out, the land drops down to a dry creekbed then back up to a hill and back down to a meandering creekbed that opens out into a meadow full of giant hosts. It's like something out of a fairy tale. The house is decorated with unique country antiques and books that go with country living. The host bent over backwards to accommodate us. The 2 weekend days following our stay were not filled so she offered them to us for a steep cut."

Walking in, the place resembled her messaging: snacks were provided, bottled water and a few pops were in the fridge, a plethora of games, VERY clean. I had asked if it had AC because the weather was supposed to be hot and she had the placed cooled for us when we got there. Lots of little touches that makes this place and host amazing.
The place was very unique and charming. The outdoor facing into the woods was amazing, plenty to see and hear which was great for my bird loving fiancé and myself. Outdoor fire pit had wood provided for us. Indoors had plenty of space, lots of blankets and very cozy feeling. The three season patio was the highlight of the indoors. No outdoor deck but one was going to be built that my fiancé and I are looking forward to! Make sure you pack some binoculars!"

Stayed with a pet","Nice place in a serene setting.
The cabin is nicely decorated with several places to sit and enjoy the property. The surroundings are quiet and the fenced in front yard was wonderful for our small dogs. We just love dog friendly airbnbs!
Some considerations:
The dedicated work space is a small classic desk with a variety of charging cables. The chair is a wooden stool. We wouldn't say it's truly a space you would be comfortable working remote in all day.
The cabin itself makes creeking noises continuously. It can be quite loud but the owners have provided white noise machines in each bedroom.
The bedrooms do not have doors but instead have curtains. Privacy is limited.
The well water is quite potent to drink or shower in. The owners provide jugs of drinking water.
Overall it was a pleasant trip."

Even in March, the scenery from the back of the home was beautiful, and we were greeted by birds and wildlife all day long. The state park is only a short 10 minute drive and provides good trails. We also loved that Columbus was only an hour away so we could do a quick day trip. Everything was very clean and all basic amenities were provided in case you forgot to pack something.

Janel had decorated it so beautifully for Christmas, that I invited my family over for Holiday photos! It was the perfect place to escape to after a long day, a cozy cottage nestled by the side of a lovely wooded area with many birds and the occasional deer.
The house itself is decorated with adorable antiques, comfortable furniture, warm accent lights, has a collection of dvd's and board games, and is stocked with everything one might need. We even cooked some Thanksgiving recipes using the assortment of kitchen supplies. We lacked nothing.
Janel was extremely responsive and friendly, and she came out on Thanksgiving day to set up outdoor chairs for us and was a delight to visit with.
I enjoyed my stay so much that I reserved some nights for my family members as a Christmas gift.
Even on the coldest day, this house is warm, inviting, cheerful and quiet! Thank you Janel! - Christina"

The kitchen has everything you would need and more. The best part is the sunroom and the camp fire outside. If you forgot to pack towels or other essentials, Janel got you covered. Janel, thank you for being such a super host everything was top notch. If your not already booked we will definitely be back next month for a family reunion."

Stayed with kids","Very quiet and comfortable cabin tucked in the woods. We were only there for one night, got in late and had to leave early, so we didn’t get much time to enjoy the outdoor spaces and we wish we could have! There was a fire pit, and the porch looked so cool! The beds were comfortable and clean, shower was too, and the kitchen was very nice with coffee and popcorn that we partook in :) we may be in the area again this summer and if we are we may plan to stay here again and spend more time."

Coming back to the cabin nestled in the woods, relaxing on the hammock, taking in the sights and sounds, it’s relaxing and rustic in a good way. The cabin is larger than you’d expect and has a really functional kitchen which I enjoyed as I was tired of eating out. Clean and comfortable it’s a really good value!"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy little place in a great location-perfect for a peaceful getaway. Surroundings were beautiful-especially during this time of year. Property wasn't far from good eating/shopping spots. Host was responsive and pleasant to communicate with. The well-mannered pets on the property were equally enjoyed.
The wi-fi seemed a bit sluggish at times and the TV probably needs replaced in the future. The water pressure was a bit on the low side, but it was nice and hot for showers. The sofa bed was considerably less comfortable than the queen in the other room. However, the layout of the space had a comfortable flow and felt roomy. The kitchenette was well equipped with odds and ends. We were provided with adequate privacy and the comforts of home. Our stay was enjoyed and we would happily return if in the area."

It was also really nice to not have to worry about that stuff. She even provided the towels, linens, and toilet paper. I liked not having to pack all the extra bulk. The binder she left was full of helpful info; I loved how she showed the time/distance to the restaurants, that was so helpful. We chose this place because of proximity to the Morrow County Fairgrounds, it was such a great value and absolutely exactly what we needed. It was seriously so perfect!"

The pond with fountain is gorgeous and lights up in different colors at night. The guest house has everything you need and has the comfiest bed ever made since the beginning of time.
There are neat caves, a huge lake, and all sorts of outdoor activities within 20 minutes, and Columbus is about 30 minutes away if you need some 5 star dining.
I would have been just as happy paying twice the price. Trish is a gem of a host."

Group trip","Unfortunately we were a little disappointed with the house. It could be a very nice place with a little maintenance and some upgrades. Needs new fresh linens and a really good deep clean. Living space could be better arranged for comfort. Needs a substantial upgrade to the water treatment. Understanding that well water is sometimes challenging it should not be cloudy. HVAC needs to be modified. One unit for both upstairs and down is not good. Downstairs is an ice box if the upstairs is comfortable.
I really hate leaving a critical review but if someone is paying for a place to stay, it should meet some basic standards. This home did not in more than one way."

Group trip","This huge garage-turned-cabin was clean and quiet, and a great pace for a relaxing reunion of old friends. There are a couple of things to know ahead of time to make your stay the most comfortable, but overall we were happy here. Special mention to the kitchen! It is incredibly well supplied, and I loved cooking with the commercial gas range.
It does take quite some time for the downstairs living area to get warm, and when it is finally up to a comfortable temperature the upstairs is extremely hot. Juggle turning down the furnace before you go to sleep, and back up in the morning - be sure to use the electric fireplace downstairs too, it gets things nice and cozy.
I'm pretty sure the water is from a well; it has small particulates and mild mineral odor. I'm used to this, but some of my friends were turned off by it. We ended up buying some gallons of water for drinking, and everyone was happy."

Stayed with kids","We planned our stay in Mt Gilead because it was a central spot to where we needed to be for two separate events we were going to ohio for. It was beautiful, serene and had a wonderful vibe.
It was a little dusty in places and the sheets did have some stains on them. The water was very hard and I did have to clean the toilets before my family arrived and they did comment on the smell and color of it but it all worked out.
Chris ended up chatting with my dad (and me briefly) for a bit and my dad had a great conversation said he was very kind and helpful. He blew up a basketball and gave us recommendations on a convenience store with fantastic food as well as where the trail in the woods were…the woods and surrounding areas are beautiful and we were able to have a fire under the stars in our last night.
Thank you so much Chris for providing such a beautiful and serene spot where we made some amazing memories."

Plenty of room for kids to play and a good kitchen area for meal preps and dinners, plus a nice trail to hike through the woods. The property is primarily wooded and has a creek. We were all able to take hot showers with no issues and sat at the fire pit every night. The owner had wood available to burn. There was a small TV which worked well but the Wi-Fi was spotty on our other devices. The home came with plenty of towels, rags, cooking and eating utensils, and comfortable bedding. The industrial oven/range was amazing! There were also various outdoor games and a basketball hoop for fun. Overall, we really enjoyed the stay!"

Pantry basics
Plenty of dishes, coffee pots, bakeware linens
Beautiful property and trails
Patio with firepit, outdoor seating
Covered porch with tables, swing, gas grill
High speed internet, Roku TVs
Friendly hosts

Upon our arrival water coming up thru floor in 1st floor bedroom, problem was NOT fixed by the end of our stay-only moved bed, put a large, loud fan on the area, pulled up carpet which made the room very cramped-no discount was offered
Water smell, taste is horrible; had to purchase a lot of bottled water
Appliances, walls, some dishes were dirty; dirty socks found under beds
No darkening shades in bedrooms
Beds were very uncomfortable, yellow pillows, noisy barn doors
Loose, poorly maintained faucets

Cons: The water had a strong metallic/sulfuric sort of smell, particularly for showers. We ended up purchasing bottled water for drinking and making coffee. Upon arrival, we needed to clean some of the pots around the stove and run the dishwasher that had been standing with dirty dishes, some of which were molding."

Group trip","What a wonderful oasis to leave busy spaces behind! It was a great place to just ""be"" for a little while. Some nice adventures within about a half hour (I do recommend Der Dutchman), but there is enough there to enjoy and to do. walk the paths, see the deer scamper away, or just sit on the porch in the evening and hear the woods come alive. Our host was quickly responsive to any questions we had, which was appreciated. As a side note, the nicest gas stove I've ever seen in any rental, I'm sure there is a story there (8 burners, what? :-)"

It is also very spacious. The guys was able to enjoy the pool table and he had some other games on the back porch. The only downsides was it was like 20 mins from the city, one of the showers the water was cold and wouldn't really get hot. (but there where 3 full bathrooms) Overall, it is a very nice cozy home away from home and Chris is very attentive and responsive to any and every need. Definitely recommend and would use him again."

I hosted a 10 person dinner one night for family and we all fit around the kitchen table comfortably. It is a peaceful home out in the country with room for a large family. My son loved the pool table. It was a perfect place to rest but also the perfect gathering for out of town guests too! It was decorated for Christmas which was lovely. We are so thankful to have stayed there.

We were blessed with sunny days, taking an easy outing to Malabar Farm or exploring the on site woods.

The bathroom is very clean and spacious. There are plenty of towels and it's always nice to have a washer and dryer.
We look forward to staying at the barn again and I very much would recommend to anyone wanting a beautiful getaway"

Stayed a few nights","We rented this to get a weekend away from the city for our anniversary. Just wanted to reset and get some peace and quiet and fresh air. We rented 2 nights but due to work we could only make it one night. The loft is beautiful and very well done. Everything is very clean and organized. They also have plenty of extras theyve put in. The views from the back door and kitchen are all farm fields and it was exactly what we wanted.... so we thought.
We got there around noon the second day of our booking. The owner met us and introduced himself. I told him we are here to get away from people and the chaos of the city even if its just for a day. We get in and get settled and open the windows and sit down to enjoy the country when he comes knocking on the door saying we must close all windows because of the pollen. Not thrilled because we came here for that but we closed them all and decided to just sit out back and maybe start a fire but when we went down to do that the owners dog was there barking so we figured we would just go hang out on the deck till he went away. That dog stood by the back deck and anytime we talked or made a noise he would start barking again. So after about 30 min of barking we went inside. So at this point we just want to enjoy some kind of fresh air. We went up to the cupola (room at the very top with 4 windows and enough room for 2 people) to just crack a window and relax. The owner messaged us to close the window I had cracked because of bugs. It is 10pm and the one window we had cracked was facing the field so he must have done a perimeter search to make sure windows were closed. This all happened in the first 10 hours there. So we gave up and just went to bed. Basically between the window nazi and the barking dog it was the exact opposite of what we were going for here. In the ad it says level of interaction was up to us but thats only true if you stay inside with the doors and windows closed at all times and even then you can still hear the dog barking just outside. We came to escape city things like people complaining and dogs constantly barking and that's all we got for the time we were here."

Group trip","Annamarie’s barn conversion loft home was so easy to give 5-stars across the board!
I’ve stayed at plenty of AirBnBs in the past 10 years - this one is definitely one of my favorites.
Her and her husband did an outstanding job on this barn conversion. It was without a doubt an early 2020, COVID-season project that they spent a lot of time bringing together details and curating decor.
I found their barn-home by accident, after procrastination got the best of me and I missed the deadline to book a hotel room for my friends and I at a sponsored hotel for a wedding - this might be the only case where procrastinating has ever worked in my favor.
This AirBnB is a perfect setup for attending weddings/gatherings/events at the Four Seasons venue in Cardington. Door to door, it’s ~13 minutes. This ended up being about half an hour closer than our encouraged hotel that most everyone else attending the wedding for stayed at. It really couldn’t have worked out any better, and everyone was rather jealous of the convenience of our stay.
I had a single ‘loose negative’ (not even really a negative!) point for their barn-home until this morning. I drive a Tesla - I understood that there was no outdoor outlet for charging my car at the barn - and did not expect them! They were not advertised as being available, and I was prepared to drive half an hour or so to reach a Tesla Supercharger. Not the most convenient, but it’s not the hosts job to cater to every single possible situation. This morning in conversation with Annamarie and her husband before we left, they mentioned they’ll be adding an outlet for electric cars and RVs soon as they’ve been very common requests. They are constantly seeking ways to better serve their guests, and it shows.
If I ever find myself staying in this part of Ohio again, Annamarie’s barn-home is at the very top of my list of places to stay."

It is definitely well kept and has plenty of thoughtful details. Our three kids (all under 10) loved climbing up to their ""secret"" place (the cupola). They also loved the games and puzzles in the space, along with seeing the chickens and Mac the dog.
Everything we needed was there. Fully stocked kitchen (with fresh eggs), nice big cozy sectional with plenty of throw blankets, extra bathroom amenities, great spaces to hang around outside (deck/firepit).
We would definitely stay here again!"

My husband, myself, and our 37-year-old daughter were able to enjoy this wonderful place over Christmas of 2021. The decorations were beautiful and the special Christmas lighting made it magical. Annamarie thought of every possible thing we could need and it was already there for us. She even left us a Christmas gift of some local honey which was enjoyed by all the family we were visiting. The beds were very comfortable. And everything was spotlessly clean. There were even butter, eggs, and coffee in the refrigerator when we arrived. I can’t recommend this place enough. And I am very fussy with high standards."

They are helpful when it comes to knowledge of the area, and are quick to respond to questions/concerns if needed. They’ve thought of everything when it comes to hospitality, from decorating for christmas to a completely full kitchen (with fresh eggs!) and cozy blankets. When it’s warmer I’m sure the deck and fire pit will be so amazing to use! Everything was spotless when we arrived, the beds were comfortable, and we felt safe there as a group of 6 girls. We stayed for a friend’s wedding nearby, and wish we would’ve had more time at the barn. We all agreed it’s probably the best Airbnb we’ve stayed at, and between the 6 of us, we’ve had lots of experiences with airbnb locations! You will love this cozy loft with relaxing country views."

It's not too far from Columbus and only about a 10-15 minute drive to some small towns with local restaurants, parks and small attractions. But do you really need to leave?
My family loved the place and are now convinced we need to buy our own property to live the farm life. The boys (1, 3, 6) thought the clubhouse was amazing and were up in down that cupola dozens of times a day. Luckily, Jim and Annamarie didn't offer us one of their kittens, because the boys loved them too. I worked remotely and was able to escape and experience some small-town fun -- mini-golf, gem hunting, local BBQ (Taste of Memphis) and cooked out ourselves.
How did I forget to mention the fresh eggs from their chickens? Nice touch!
We wish we could have stayed longer!"

The house is a rural property in good condition. Water pressure was good, the water was softened and free of objectionable odors and tastes. The bathroom had been recently updated. The paver walk and fire circle are relatively new and nicely done."

Stayed a few nights","I always love coming here. It always feels like coming home, and each year they add something new to enjoy it seems. This year they had a new pave-stone patio and firepit area, which I would have used but it was January so I had to pass. What I really love is how quiet and peaceful it is here. Out in the woods you feel like you are the only one for miles around, with the exception of a few cars passing by about once every half hour. It really is quite remote and private. The bathroom was updated last year I believe, it is VERY clean and everything runs great. I always appreciate the dozen eggs and homemade chocolate chip cookies waiting for me when I arrive! I try not to eat all of them, but every year they're gone by my 3rd day :)
I am already looking forward to coming back in 2025. Thanks for the memories!"

Love her cookies she bakes to welcome you. very clear instructions and always right there if you need anything. firepit was so nice to use over Christmas, lots of room for 8 chairs comfortably by the fire pit, has wood and fire poker, and sticks to roast on in garage. we enjoyed sitting by the fire, drinking hot chocolate, and making smores with the family. House/bedding was clean and smelled good when you walk in."

Stayed a few nights","DeAnns place met our needs. I would say that the ledge of the staircase with no rail was nerve wracking with a baby and a child. I would strongly consider staying somewhere else if you are traveling with someone elderly or a toddler, which I think DeAnn mentions in her description. I also feel like the cleaning list for checkout was a little excessive given the cleaning fee, but that a systemic problem with AirBNB.
DeAnn was incredibly kind and welcoming. Cookies are delicious."

Stayed a few nights","The house felt much cleaner than last time I stayed there, which is appreciated - no spiders! I also appreciated how quickly you came to spray the bees that were attempting to make a home under the deck and above the garage door siding.
Your new brick walkway and firepit patio looks beautiful - very well done, I wish I had the time to use it. I was too tired from hunting all day to do much other than go to bed once I got back!
The new metal roof is a huge plus, and with the rain storms we had, very soothing to fall asleep to.
The main bathroom overhaul is wonderful - it felt so clean and brand new, and the new shower is such an improvement! I loved that I didn't have to duck down for the shower head, since it was installed nice and high.
There were shooting stars, rainbows, a few bucks and plenty of does to watch during my stay. Your pet ducks are very polite, and I enjoyed interacting with them on the way to and from my stand each morning and evening. Always a few quacks to greet me :)
Looking forward to coming back again, I may be back for muzzleloader season!

It is clear that DeAnn values her guests comfort and cleanliness and we really appreciated that. I’m always a little curious about what to expect in regard to mattress and pillow comfort and our bed and pillows were very comfortable and provided great rest for us for our three night stay. Also, DeAnn’s hospitality was second to none. We arrived to freshly baked cookies as well as fresh eggs! We all enjoyed the ducks and sheep right outside our back door every day. Now we want some of our own! DeAnn took us for a farm tour and my kids were able to feed the chickens and lead the alpacas around. It was such a special place and a trip that we won’t soon forget. We loved our stay at DeAnn’s home and plan to visit again on our next trip to the area."

Stayed with kids","Our family of six had a wonderful time at this beautiful Airbnb farm stay. The house was so peaceful, with beautiful country views in every direction. We enjoyed the back deck and new fire pit, the kids ran around the huge yards and enjoyed the frogs in the pond, and we explored the back woods a bit. The house itself was in great shape, the A/C worked really well, and it had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay.
And DeAnn was an incredible host! We wanted to give our city slicker kids (and ourselves!) some exposure to farm animals and light chores. Once a day we tagged along with DeAnn to help feed the newborn lambs, pet the dogs, feed the chickens, and gather eggs. DeAnn was so patient with our kids, answering their questions and accommodating them when they were anxious. Our four year old was especially enamored with the animals, so DeAnn showed her the cattle lot, sheep pasture, etc. She was so kind and generous with her time.
I would highly recommend this place! Whether for a low-key farm stay or just for some R&R at a peaceful, quiet country house. Thanks, DeAnn!!"

My kids - aged 4 and 5 - LOVED bottle feeding the baby lambs and collecting the chicken eggs. We also got to witness a baby cow be born during our stay, which was just so cool, and a once in a lifetime experience for us city folks. :) The adults all commented on how much we learned about farming -- it was truly an educational experience for the full family. The house itself was clean and well-stocked. We enjoyed our stay, and would recommend to others."

For example, I was in need of a tool that I had forgotten at home, and she brought several of them over within 30 minutes. Upon arrival, the house was clean as usual, there were fresh eggs in the refrigerator, and a plate of home-made chocolate chip cookies! The overall ambience of the home is very pleasant, cheerful, and positive. Last year they updated their washer and dryer, so those are brand new and greatly appreciated. There's a charm to this home, and you really have to visit to understand. It's quiet, peaceful, lots of wildlife to observe and enjoy. If you're looking to get away from the business of the daily grind, you may want to give this place a chance. I'm already looking forward to coming back in January (just a few short months away!)
Thanks, DeAnn! Wonderful as always :)"

Upon arrival, our hosts, DeAnn and Joe, warmly welcomed us with butterfly/frog catching nets for our kids and delicious chocolate chip cookies for all.  My parents and our two young kids enjoyed their days exploring and playing around the beautiful, spacious yard and pond, keeping cool in the cozy air conditioned home, touring the farm and helping with chores. The home is set between two pastures, one of which the large flock of sheep had been moved to just before our arrival. Hopefully they enjoyed our company as much as we did theirs! The home is incredibly well equipped. We had everything we needed and more, including a well equipped kitchen for preparing meals, comfy sleeping accommodations and all was neat and clean. The open country setting provided views of amazing sunsets and fabulous star gazing. My husband and I were attending a conference near Columbus and, although it was an hour away, the drive took us on an enjoyable scenic route of beautiful farms, endless fields of corn and soybeans, helping the hour to pass quickly. Though my husband and I were not able to spend much time appreciating the accommodations, it was so nice returning each evening to such a beautiful, peaceful setting and my parents and kids thoroughly enjoyed their fun stay. Thank you DeAnn and Joe!!"

The kids were so happy about it! The farm visit is extra bonus for the stay, we learned SO MUCH about farming! It’s fascinating! The kids get to hold the baby lambs and they were so excited. The house is spotless clean, the wifi is speedy, which is a nice feature for rural areas when reception gets spotty. DeAnn really took a further step thinking of her guests needs! She has pack n play, toddler potty seat, air mattress, lots of board games, first aid kit and some common medicine, really a lot of things I won’t expect from an Airbnb! And have to mention the meat! Man! Make sure you get some meat and eggs! My mother in law can’t stop complimenting the meat and we came back to get more the second day! Really enjoyed some “off time” from the city. Hopefully to come back and visit one day with a better weather 😊"

Stayed with kids","WOW. What an incredible stay. A gorgeous home. Well maintained. You are on a farm. you pull into a long driveway with horses to the left and sheep dog as protectors. You are out in the country. We were welcomed with a dish of cookies, ice cream in the freezer and farm fresh eggs. In addition our visit was during Christmas and there was a lighted tree for us and kids to enjoy. We have done Airbnb before but this was extraordinary. we packed half of our kitchen as we were going to cook holiday dinner for family. However, the kitchen was more equipped then anything I have ever seen. I wouldnt even compare this to a hotel. All beds had sheets pillows blankets and more. They left air mattresses. Towels galore in addition to all bathroom necessities. This was truly a gifted find for us. They even were thoughtful and left us lots of ice. and our last night we used a gifted entrance pass for the upper sandusky light show which was fabulous. If you knew me personally you would understand how thrilled I was as I said on arrival this is too long a drive and after our trip ended i said we are coming back next year. it was like OUR home. You're out in nowhere but its quaint and beautiful. Book it enjoy it"

Stayed with kids","DeAnn is absolutely a super host! The house was perfect for our family with every amenity we needed in an amazing farm setting. Sheep to the East, chickens and horses to the west. And a great pond for swimming in the back yard.
The house was spotless and extremely comfortable. We had everything we needed for a fun family getaway. DeAnn was available right away to answer any questions we had and was the most accommodating host. Very kind and helpful.
We will go back for sure!"

Stayed with kids","My family wanted a little break from all of the noise of life and decided on DeAnn’s place. It was lovely, private, comfortable- had all the cookware and blankets we needed! It was spacious with plenty of room to sleep - it could have easily hosted a large family. The views of the farm and trees in the distance were refreshing. DeAnn took us on a tour of the farm where our 2 year old got to get up close with chickens, horses, cows and dogs (and the cutest puppies!). We watched the sheep run in the fields from the deck of the house. There were cookies on the table and fresh eggs for us to use in the fridge upon our arrival, we enjoyed both!"

Our kids adored getting to go over to the farm and help with the animals, I wish I could get them that enthusiastic about chores at home! The also loved catching tadpoles in the pond and walking through the woods out back. The house itself was just right, everything was clean comfortable, the ice cream maker was the perfect touch of nostalgia to complete the whole experience. We can't wait to go back sometime."

There were fresh baked cookies awaiting our arrival, farm fresh eggs in the fridge. We had pre-ordered some meat that was also left for us. The house was comfortable. The farm was amazing. My kids had a blast feeding baby lambs and chickens, seeing the horses and cows. This is one of the best experiences that I have given to my children. They were begging to go back before we got home."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Good Thyme on the Farm was AMAZING! We have 3 teenagers and it was a great experience for our whole family. DeAnn, our host, was an incredibly kind and welcoming individual. She was so caring and gentle with the animals and she made us feel like a part of the family. Our children were able to play with the animals on the farm and we even got to see three sheep being born! We have stayed numerous Airbnb's all over the world and our family agreed this was up there with one of our favorite experiences. The home was extremely clean, check-in and communication was easy, and we felt like there was a ton to do - including walking in the woods, swimming in the pond, going to the farm, going to town (both Upper Sandusky and Marion), sitting on the back deck listening to the frogs and having a couple of beers, or just sitting inside at night watching a movie on Netflix :) It was a fantastic weekend and we are so grateful for the experience and the memories.
Thanks DeAnn and Joe!!!!"

With the three bedrooms upstairs we had no problems with two kiddos. We spent Christmas here and they left fresh goodies, baked and from the farm! We love to get away and be surrounded by nature and this was just perfect. We cooked nice little meals and never had to leave! we took short hikes on the property with our kiddos and sat on the deck with coffee in the morning. The sunrise/sunset over their property is lovely!
Hosts are so kind and generous and allowed us to meet some really neat animals that my kids can’t stop talking about! Will visit again for sure."

Stayed a few nights","I'm from Massachusetts, grew up in Ohio. I made a trip back home to go to the OSU/Michigan football game (by the way, OSU blew them out 56-27, woot woot) and then a 3 day deer hunting trip on a family farm in Kenton, OH. I came across DeAnn's house on Airbnb and it was perfect. From the minute I asked questions about the house, to booking to leaving, DeAnn was on it. She responded quickly and is a great, friendly person. We even got to meet her daughters, dogs and puppies! DeAnn welcomed us with farm raised eggs for the mornings and a fresh plate of Oatmeal Raisin cookies to die for. We didn't spend much time at the house since we were up and at em by 6 a.m. and got back to the house around 7:30 each night, enough time to watch a good movie on Netflix (Make sure to bring your username and passwords for any app you want to use, like Hulu, Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.). The house was warm, cozie, clean and perfect for what we needed. In the Summer, I could see this being a nice getaway to just simply relax. Go hiking, fishing and wildlife viewing in nearby areas. They live on a farm next door and have plenty of animals to keep younger kids entertained.
By far, highly recommend this place for a country respite!! Thanks again DeAnn!!"

There is a bar/restaurant about 3 minutes from the house. The owners took time to show us around the family farm, which was awesome. Great opportunity to show kids the farm life! They also sell meat from their farm, so make sure to buy a couple steaks to cook while there! I highly recommend this house! We will be back!"

The longer we were there, the more we appreciated the charm of the place, and we also discovered more and more about the history of this fascinating family. The property was lovely, and we took our dogs for walks on the marked trails daily. It felt as though we were walking through a fairyland. We even took the time to drive to the Nature Preserve directly across the river to enjoy more trails. We never saw another soul and had the entire property to ourselves. Tip: The home contains mostly beige carpeting. Bring slippers to change into right inside of the door to avoid introducing mud to the space. We loved the river view with morning coffee and the kitchen table was ideal for games."

The house was well represented from photos on the website. The kitchen was stocked with everything to cook a meal. Living room large with areas to stretch out. Beds comfortable. Our other option when staying in Marion area were 2 hotel rooms which would have been more expensive and would have lost the coziness of a home. I would recommend if anyone staying in the greater Marion area.

Stayed one night","This place was great for hosting our family Christmas Eve dinner. There was plenty of seating with the folding table and chairs for the 9 of us. Having a full kitchen made everything easy. The place was very clean and cosy with plenty of supplies. The location was beautiful, on the river. The kids liked the piano, too! The Wi-Fi worked well for our Skype call with the distant relatives. Only one couple spent the night, but they say they slept well. The house directions were clear and easy to follow. We would definitely return for another family dinner."

Stayed a few nights",The home is very quiet and had the amenities we needed. Communication was very timely and the hosts were able to fix an issue with the keyless entry within minutes. We were very busy during our visit and ate out except for breakfast so really only slept at the house. The WiFi was fast. The grounds are beautiful but it was snowing and very cold so we didn’t explore. The home could use a little TLC but nothing major. The hot water lasts a long time and the house was well stocked with necessities. The location is very convenient for a visit to Marion and the house is far better than the hotels in the immediate vicinity.

Stayed a few nights","Terradise is peace and quite at its best. I have stayed here three times and it’s has always been wonderful. A few things I would recommend. 1. Bring some bird seed for the feeder on the back porch. Hours of fun watching the birds and chipmunks eat. 2. If you like some television during the few hours inside bring a fire stick. The local channels don’t come in to well. 3. Use caution exiting the driveway as some idiots coming around the curve may not see you. 4. Very important to take your time exploring the property paths as you will see something different each time , geese, ducks, ground hogs, turtles, deer, beavers and sooo many different birds. Even if your not into nature this place just change that. Oh and the residence is nice and comfortable."

Stayed with kids","We read many glowing reviews of Terradise on Airbnb. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the overall condition of the property and lack of cleanliness.
The weather was cool and beautiful, but many of the windows don't open and/or don't have screens. Many of the miniblinds do not properly operate. The carpet has many large stains and the house has a musty odor. The mattress in smaller bedroom is quite old and uncomfortable, the headboard was dusty and the baseboards were unclean.
Multiple rooms have paint and or wallpaper peeling. Several cabinets in kitchen are not securely attached.
The outside of the home is not well cared for. The steps to entry are pulling away from porch, the railings and banisters are loose, peeling paint, missing spindles. The gazebo is overgrown and unusable. Outdoor wooden chair had slats missing and exposed nails.
The host was responsive when we discovered a leak under kitchen sink and sent a plumber next morning to repair. David was kind enough to return rx glasses which I left behind.
I'm sure Terradise was once a beautiful home in a scenic location. It's sad to see the lack of maintenance and I'm sorry to say, we would not return."

Great rental especially if you want somewhere to stay with beautiful natural features, but also room to entertain friends during the day. The binoculars were also a great addition to help enjoy the property.
The only note I would leave to other renters is to watch out on the road if you have small kids or pets. The property is located at a bend in the road and locals do not slow down. I recommend pulling in all the way forward in the driveway and then backing up into the parking spaces so that you don't have to reverse out on to the road."

Stayed with kids","I am a travel nurse and spent every weekend here for 12 weeks. Walking into this home I felt like I had gone back in time to my grandma’s house. It was so charming. All the appliances worked, the garbage disposal quit working but that was no big deal to me as I was not cooking. The beds were comfortable, and everything was very clean. There are somethings that need attention. The ceiling paint is peeling off, there is a tile in the bathroom that is broken off, wallpaper is peeling off in some spots but this is all cosmetic. Terrance is amazing to deal with. He is so friendly and quick to help. He even shoveled the driveway for my husband and I during a blizzard. After the weather cleared up my husband even took our 4 year old on an adventure on the beautiful grounds. I would definitely stay again."

The house is very roomy and clean. Everything needed is provided to make the stay there comfortable and relaxing. Our favorite part of our stay was feeding and watching all of the birds through the picture window on the back of the house facing the river. The view through that window is absolutely amazing!
David is a wonderful host and kept in touch to make sure our stay was comfortable. Tyler is a great caretaker and was available for any questions we might have had.
We look forward to many more stays at Terradise on our trips back to Ohio to visit our family!!"

Stayed about a week","This is my second week at Terradise and far from last. That should tell anyone how great this place is. I wish I could tell everyone it was bad so it would be easier getting the dates I need there but I just couldn't do that. I stayed here on the first weekend in March 2020 so read my review from that date, its still as nice if not better. It was a lot warmer outside this time and I was concerned about the AC not being able to cool the house, I like it cool inside. After turning on the AC when I got there it quickly started to get cool inside. When I got up the next morning I was freezing and got up and looked at the thermostat and it was 64 degrees. Didn't worry about the AC cooling the house the rest of the week."

Stayed about a week","Davids place is the best place I have ever stayed at for peace and quiet. I am retired Navy and travel a lot as I dive at several locations. No swimming pools or beaches here but the surroundings more then make up for that. The stream in the back is nice when its warmer as I use to fish in it during the1960-70s when I lived in Marion. Always caught several fish. The pond on the property looks like the only thing in it would be frogs but I took a chance and tried it out and was surprised by catching some nice bass. Of course catch and release only for other people to enjoy it. I saw some deer in the back yard on my first morning along with ducks and geese and soooo many other birds. The yard or should I just say the huge property has flowers every where. The inside of the home is filled with books on nature and Ohio history. I was born and raised in the Marion/Edison area and left in 1972 to join the Navy. I was reading in one of Trellas (original owner) books that she edited I found some of my family history from Edison. My grandfather owned a mill there and was a well known community member from Edison. Teeradise is an older (1952) home that has been well taken care of. Reminded me of staying at my grandparents home when I was a kid in Edison. If your a outdoors person or just love nature you will not find a better place. I have heard that changes are coming that may change how Teeradise is set up, like going away from airbnb and set up for classes on nature. I hope this does not come about. So if your planning to stay here make your reservation SOON."

Stayed a few nights","First, I’m going to talk about the good things about this rental. The hosts, David and Jed, were both very polite and quick to respond to questions. Beds were comfortable. Linens and towels were clean and fresh. Main bathroom and kitchen were clean and hot water worked. Kitchen had refrigerator (w/ice maker), dishwasher, microwave, stove etc. There is a TV but we never used it so can’t tell you more than that. There is WiFi though it tended to be intermittent at night. We also lost it after a severe electrical storm and David helped us reboot it when it would not do so on its own. Now the bad things about the house: This house was probably wonderful in its prime. But time is catching up with it and no one is intervening. The house is covered in mold, pieces of it are falling off, and vegetation is growing over it, the gazebo and the pathways. The worst part though was the smell. The inside of the house smells strongly of mildew. It was horrible. The odor was so strong that everything we took into that house still reeked three days after returning home. Other things that need to be dealt with are old worn carpets and dusty blinds. Now someone might ask “why did we stay if it stank?” Well, good question. One I paid for it. Two, It was where I needed to be. Three, finding a place in Marion, Ohio that would take two dogs (one that looks like a 55 pound white lioness) late on a Thursday night… You get the idea. Then someone might ask did we ask the host to do something about it. What was he going to do? Run out with a can of Lysol. This is not a quick fix situation. I hope someday Terradise is once again a Paradise."

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone needing a nice little home away from home for a few days."

Stayed a few nights","Talk about off the beaten path! If you are a writer and need peace, or birdwatcher and need quiet, or just want to escape, you'll feel right at home. Down to the afghans for warmth and washer and dryer for comfort and ease of keeping your clothes clean, a driveway easy to park in and turn around in, and a very unique ""water closet"" that gave us a few laughs, it was a good place for three friends to stay. I was a tad bummed we couldn't light a fire for warmth or ambiance, but it wasn't the end of the world. Beds are comfortable! And the large bed in the master is actually HUGE! Very wide. And, super comfy! Access was very easy, and the host is very friendly, responded to texts quickly. Just be warned, the internet is a tad spotty and unreliable late at night. Of course, that's no fault of the host at all. Just the charm of rural Ohio!"

Stayed one night","Amazing area, really. Tons of trails and pathways to walk through on the grounds, which have an interesting and rich history.
The house is LOADED with books, most of them revolving around plants, birds, trees, gardening and wildlife. Though I found a philosophy book or two, along with some classic literature.
Very, very clean. Almost felt bad being there in general because it was so well kept.
You may want to bring a Firestick or a laptop if you're the Netflix/Hulu/Youtube type. There is wifi, but no cable.
Also, the house is REALLY quiet, so you may also bring a box-fan for white noise if you're like me and need something droning about to help you sleep.
Overall it was an A+ for my wife, dog and I. Beautiful views from inside the house and around the grounds, super clean and very quiet."

We had the best time kayaking, bird watching, fishing, hot tubbing and just sitting outside enjoying family time! Their home and the surroundings were so beautiful that we found ourselves coming back earlier than planned to enjoy this home and amenities. We will definitely be back!"

Group trip",My team was in town for a shooting competition and needed a place to house our team of 6. Everyone was comfortable and super excited to stay at this incredible place. Our only regret was not getting the chance to enjoy all the outdoor amenities that the host provided. We left the house around 6:30 am everyday and didn't get back until late at night. The spacious outdoor was so nice to come back to and relax to the sound of the river next to us. Would definitely book again when we're back in town for next year's competition.

Beautiful real hardwood floors, huge granite countertop, amazing hot tub, tons of space, open floorplan, peaceful setting but also close to a very cool town. AirBnB sets their review system up so people feel like they sometimes have to hide negative reviews by only saying things like ""great location"" when the actual place isn't very nice... but this place is the real deal. Our family made this the gathering spot for graduation weekend and we're already talking about making it an annual thing. If you're looking for a really nice place in a great setting then rent here with confidence!"

This home was just a short drive from the interstate, yet all the amenities such as grocery stores and coffee were 5 min. away. We had a large trailer and the parking next door was perfectly accommodating. We AirBNB a lot and this was definitely one of our favorites!!"
