Stayed one night","I was looking for a peaceful place to spend an evening while on a road trip.
I just wanted something quiet, simple and a private place that was close to the I70.
This was a great place for me while seeking a quick evening in Topeka.
Kurt's place was perfect!"

Stayed over a week",Kurt's place was perfect for me. I stayed for 5 months while working at a local hospital. It was less than a 5-minute ride to work. It had what I needed to meal prep and take my food to work. Grocery store was a 2-minute ride. There was also a great area to go for a walk that you could walk to also close (5 min ride) to the local zoo park which was also a great place to go for a walk.

Stayed over a week","If you need a place to stay for a month or far less, this is a good spot. The door is immediately met by carpet, be sure to use a sturdy push to get the door open. You’ll be accompanied by a loud bang from the screen door if you don’t gently close it yourself. There was a bit of a pest problem, I don’t think it has anything to do with the Host but more so the town itself. I was bitten by spiders and saw rodents scrambling across the kitchen floor to go underneath the appliances, they even got into the cupboards.
Since I wasn’t notified beforehand, trash goes out on Tuesday if you’re staying for longer than a few days. Loved the shower, loved the comfiness of the bed, loved the fact there’s a washer and drier. A bit of a tight space if you’re taller than 5”6-8. The stay was alright and I’m not saying anything to discourage anyone, just honesty and a fair warning if you do happen to encounter some things mentioned."

Stayed over a week","Kurt was very accommodating and very responsive. He was there when I arrived at his home and was very welcoming, giving me a tour. He, very thoughtfully, came back later that afternoon with a baby gate to keep my little dog (who is completely blind) from falling down the stairs. Later that weekend, I had trouble with the television and he came right over and set everything up. He kept the yard mowed and tidy. Then, he left me to my own devices, which I appreciated. I worked M-F, 8-5 and my weekends were for resting. I loved that there is a W/D on site and a full size refrigerator. I would recommend this property to anyone needing a clean and comfortable place to stay while in Topeka."

Stayed with a pet",We enjoyed our stay as the home is very comfy with much details to the small things to make you feel at home. It had been snowing and the driveway/sidewalk was cleared and was also cleared another time while we were staying. Nice back porch and fenced in yard. Neighborhood was very quiet and nestled away from traffic. We loved the added touch of a snack basket as well as a coffee pot and Keurig combo with multiple hot tea options. The beds and bedding were very comfortable and plenty of space for a larger family to stay and have ample room. The host was very responsive and accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend 10/10.

Stayed with kids","We couldn’t have picked a better place for our family of 5 to stay at while in Topeka. The house is beautiful and very well cared for. All of the beds were incredibly comfortable. The upstairs portion has its own AC so our kids slept comfortably even on very hot nights. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook all of our meals each day. There were toys, books, and games that our kids loved. The bathroom had all of the essentials and plenty of towels. We loved sitting on the back patio each evening and morning. The hosts were always quick to respond with any questions. The neighborhood was beautiful and peaceful. We took walks through it each day. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."

House matched the listing and Adam was very helpful in assisting us as we extended our reservation by a day to accommodate early (full day) arrival. We stay in a lot of AirBnbs, across the country, and this one would rank at the top in terms of comfort and convenience for a great value. We’d be happy to stay here again should we ever find ourselves in Topeka overnight."

Stayed with kids","This home is a gem! Everything is thoughtfully arranged for ease and comfort. My preschooler kept saying, “This place has everything! And it’s so organized!” The latter may be commentary on my housekeeping, but he wasn’t wrong.
We were on a family trip, and it was great to be able to have him upstairs, in the basement, or in the yard while his teenage cousins slept in— the house packs a lot of utility into a compact footprint. The kitchen and bathroom had high-quality versions of everything we needed and many useful, generous extras. Everything was clean and well cared for. Strong wifi and a smart TV provided all the technological comforts of home. The house is on a quiet residential street and convenient to thoroughfares and amenities.
Communication was always very prompt, thorough, and accommodating. I would recommend this stay to anyone!"

The attic playroom was a great space but the stairs are pretty steep so we were sure to keep the door closed as I have small children.

The location is very peaceful, safe, and quiet yet restaurants and services are nearby. The suite is extremely clean, neat, and tidy. The host Carmen provides many thoughtful touches and amenities that were not expected but very much appreciated. This feels like you are staying in someone's home. When we arrived, the air conditioning was already on and the place cool and comfortable on a hot day. My two traveling companions and I all slept like babies in comfort and quiet peace. There's a fantastic pull-through driveway that makes for easy parking when you're tired after a long day on the road, and gets you right back out the next day without any difficulties. We are definitely remembering our stay here and plan to return on our next transcontinental trip!"

This was perfect! Everything was there that we needed. Wifi was strong enough for multiple devices being used at the same time. Kitchen was stocked with every baking/cooking item we needed. Couches, bed, towels, it was all so comfortable too.
We found many safe places to walk/run within a 10 minute drive. Plus, for covid safe entertainment in the area, a historical driving tour with the use of a free app to dive into the history of Topeka. (Nps: Brown to Brown)."

My only complaint was that, if you need the extra cots set up in the kitchen area or if you sleep on the futon, those blinds are not covered by curtains, so sunlight seeps in as soon as the sun comes up, and that can make it hard to sleep. Some thick curtains over all the blinds would really help. Otherwise, the space was great."

Stayed a few nights","This is my second time staying at Carmen’s place! I rated it as “just what I had expected” simply because I already had high expectations! Carmen came through yet again. Simple, yet clean (amazingly clean) place with everything you really need for a comfortable stay.
Nice welcoming touches include baked goods, popcorn, bottled water and chocolate. When you have been traveling for 20+ hours, these touches make a difference!"

Stayed a few nights","My new home away from home! This place and this host were a 10/10 for me. I’ve stayed at dozens of Airbnbs across the world (Canada, US, Spain, Scotland) - this place was hands down my favourite experience; a total gem. It was charming, clean, comfortable, spacious, and situated in a beautiful, quiet, safe neighbourhood. It had everything we needed and more - comfy beds with LOTS of extra linens, bathrobes, fluffy towels, even slippers and flip flops for walking out to the hot tub. It was a PERFECT destination for 2 people (Mom and teenage son) and could have easily accommodated 4-6 people. The 🐰decor was my favourite part, second only to host Candi - wow!! She was not only responsive but also proactive - she sent friendly messages and reminders that she was a text away. The opportunity to stay in such a beautiful, historical home was a joy. Check in, check out and all communication was top notch. Thank you She Shed - we had an amazing time."

The neighborhood felt very safe and was quiet. There were so many thoughtful touches like flip flops and towels for the hot tub, s’more sticks, snacks, chocolates, books, games, tennis rackets, corn hole etc. We loved that we could walk right across the street to the park! The kids enjoyed the playground, tennis courts, playing basketball, and the large grass area. We loved spending the evenings in the backyard having s’mores and soaking in the hot tub! We also really enjoyed our day trips at the Topeka Zoo and the Kansas Children’s Discovery Center which were just down the road from the She Shed. We plan to stay again when we are back in Kansas visiting family! :)"

I love the quaint decor and all the little 'at home' amenities that truly made me feel like I was being hosted by a dear friend. Although I did not have my dog with me, I especially loved the welcoming of pets and rules to keep things clean for all guests. Candi was super kind and accommodating when I asked for flexibility in check in and check out, which I really appreciate. I left this beautiful home so refreshed and peaceful after a wonderful girls weekend away. Thank you for creating such a unique space!"

We ended up with some cold weather, and there were puzzles, books, big TV, plenty of throws to keep us warm, snacks, and and we were all comfortable, including our elderly dog. We were very close to the historic sites we wanted to visit and restaurants, and the park across the street was lovely. Candi really goes the extra mile with the special touches in the kitchen, for artwork, and we loved the bunny theme for Easter time. We didn’t get to take advantage of the hot tub, but we sure will next time we come to visit. We really liked the front porch, and enjoyed reading outdoors on the nice afternoon that we did have. This is arguably the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at."

The She Shed was exactly what I needed. Nestled in a quiet neighborhood, I could walk the dogs safely, and enjoy the fire pit in the backyard. Beautifully restored historic bungalow with such charm and everything you could need (tv, wifi, games, puzzles, hot tub, fire pit, and a kitchen you can feel comfortable cooking in. Thoughtfully styled and decorated and just a few minutes drive from restaurants, art galleries, and shopping. Candi is a caring and responsive host. Definitely keeping the She Shed on my list of places to stay again! 😁❤️"

Stayed one night","The thing that made this not a five star review—and which wasn’t fixable—was the extremely strong artificial Glade plug in scent all over the house. We are allergic to things like this, as are many of you reading this, so be aware. Candi was responsive and we placed the plug ins outside, but the smell with such synthetic scents does not dissipate easily. The place was nice but we had migraines and were nauseous from the smell so it was hard to get a good night’s sleep, which we desperately needed after driving from Denver."

I really appreciate how easy it is to stay at their place - all the little details make it easy to cook, relax, get ready, etc. Quiet neighborhood, spotless clean, good location. They are super responsive and even a little question like ""Is there a crockpot?"" is met with one appearing along with a cookbook. I also asked if it was possible to come a day earlier and while it couldn't be accommodated due to another booking, they proactively reached out to let me know I could check in early the day of my arrival. They go above and beyond. Thank you again! All positives and not a single negative. This is going to be my number one choice whenever I'm in Topeka :)"

Stayed a few nights","We greatly enjoyed our stay at Amy and Aaron's place. It is centrally located to plenty of great restaurants, especially one of our favorites in the area, Circle Coffee Co. Aaron and Amy clearly put loads of effort into transforming this house into a modern and comfortable home where one can enjoy all that Topeka has to offer. When we had an issue during our stay, they quickly came over to address the problem and really showed their desire for their guests to enjoy their experience. We appreciated the kind gestures, flexibility and communication. Check-in and checkout were easy and fast. As stated, the king bed is firm, but we didn't have any issues. I also always like having blackout shades in the bedroom as we're pretty sensitive to light, and this is something that is often overlooked, but there are easy and convenient shades throughout the house. There's even a white noise machine, which is a great touch! We'd love to visit again."

Stayed one night","This was a perfect place to stay while driving home from a road trip out west. The house is super cute, relaxing, and comforting. Everything was spotless and had the perfect blend of being both well designed and comfortable. It's in a quiet, residential neighborhood where I felt entirely safe as a solo woman traveler. The shower was great. The bed was very comfortable. I'm sensitive to both light and smells and am starting to add remarks about that to my reviews...all of the lights I used had nice, warm light, and the house smelled just lightly of apples and spice, not overpowering at all, just a slight cozy hint of fall. A+ all around. Thanks, Amy!
P.S. This is also super convenient from 1-70 without any road noise whatsoever. Would 100% stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","Such an exceptional stay! As the midpoint for our cross country move, we searched Topeka for a space that would allow our two large dogs (whom Lisa left cookies for) and would be able to accommodate a large Uhaul with several other vehicles and be safe.
Lisa and Chad were a dream. They were super responsive and friendly in communication and even sent us info for a fun local event during our stay. Really though, it was their kindness accommodating our almost 1AM arrival, searching endlessly for a set of keys we lost (and mailing them to us), and Chad even went so far as to let us drive through part of his yard because we couldn’t get the Uhaul and trailer turned around.
The space was incredibly clean, cozy, and felt like home. The fridge was fully stocked with an awesome mini bar, and the cabinets had plenty of complimentary snacks (which was a blessing at 1AM when nothing was open). The best stay we’ve had anywhere and it’s clear the experience has been thoughtfully created."

It was like staying at a friends house.
We were fortunate enough to meet Dana (mother-in-law) and Kody (friendly pup). We were even sent home with a rose bush.

Stayed with a pet","The airbnb inside space was very comfortable. The outside space was also lovely, but we had a couple incidents with their two larger dogs being loose. The first time was when we arrived and at least one dog jumped on my car in several places and left scratch marks. Lisa apologized, and told us that the pitbull looking dog was an abused rescue, but that she would keep their dogs in their front yard seperate from us and our dog. The other incident was more frightening as I was outside with my dog on leash to go potty. We were near the airbnb and not near the main house. The two larger dogs came charging at my smaller dog and me from near their house. It was very frightening and I had to yell ""no"" several times for them to stay back to avoid confrontation with my own dog. Lisa appeared soon and called her dogs and apologized profusely. She told me they are getting the rescue into training and a collar of sorts. I wouldn't want anything like this (or worse) to happen to other guests."

The bed was comfortable and we fell asleep instantly. The hosts have thought of everything in case you forgot something, including drinks stocked in the refrigerator. The shower was roomy and water pressure was great. The hot tub was so relaxing and much needed to melt away our stress and aching muscles. There's lights that illuminate the way to the hot tub!

The extra touches they put in the place makes you feel right at home, from the cookies for you when you arrive to the snacks that are available so you don't have to worry about trying to find a grocery store as soon as you get there. Also the recommendations on where to get food and other items. We took there advice for The Sommerset Hall Cafe, talk about some great southern down home cooking. Once again you can't go wrong staying here!!!"

Not only is the location private and quiet, the grounds and property are kept up beautifully. The bed is as comfortable as they come and the kitchen is immaculately stocked with everything you need after a long day of driving! Lisa was so kind and offered us a couple slices of her homemade banana bread, which I’ll be dreaming about for years, I’m sure. Thank you, Lisa and Chad, for yet again another great experience!! Xo"

The reviews did NOT disappoint! Lisa and Chad gave my dog and I a home away from home, and I cannot express how much I appreciated the way they made us feel. They treated my pup as one of their own and even let him out for me when I was at work some days!
If you ever find yourself this way, I recommend you stay here!! You will not be disappointed. It was about 15 minutes away to almost anything you needed while you still got the feel of the rural countryside."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect place to stay if you just need a bed & shower & won't be spending much time in the apartment.
Bring extra blankets just in case. You have NO control over the temp of the apartment. I found out later there is a space heater you can use. The ceiling fan ONLY works at high speed. The person renting the main house controls the temp. If no one is renting the main house, it felt like the A/C or heat is just turned off.
The place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the couch looked new.
The office chair in a review from Feb said it was broken, it is still broken. There is no kitchen sink, the fridge is very small, only 2 plates, no silverware, but there are 4 wine glasses. (the rules say to clean all the dishes you use but with no kitchen sink it does make that a little difficult.)"

Stayed one night","Ryan’s place was very affordable and in a good area. For that I am thankful. Unfortunately he had a couple amenities listed that were not there and his communication was quick, but not helpful.
Heat and A/C are listed amenities, but you have no access to change either. This is a basement Airbnb and whoever is renting the upstairs room gets the say on the temperature as that is where the thermostat is. If no one is staying upstairs, then you don’t get to change it at all.
His smoke detector also did not work even after we tested it many times. This would not have been so bad if he also put a fire extinguisher in the place, but he didn’t. Very unsafe combination.
There was also only one roll of toilet paper which we quickly went through as I had a bit of a runny nose. We had to ration out the TP which is not enjoyable.
Lastly, in our opinion, the place felt thrown together without thought to decor. This is matter of opinion I realize, but that is the feeling we had."

1) The bathroom sink faucet doesn’t have good water stream. Needs replaced or repaired
2) The bed linen was scant and dirty. There should be some good comforter as temp inside was 56. It was too cold or too hot. There was very foul pet odor and throughout the night looks like a dog was pulling some chain.
3) No hangers in closet
4) No water bottles
5) THE STUDY CHAIR WAS BROKEN. I NEARLY LOST MY BALANCE AND WAS ABOUT TO FELL.
6) No spoons or bowls or plates in kitchen area.
7) The Garage door keypad needs replacing. It doesn’t want to work sometimes

It was more of a small inconvenience than a major problem."

Quiet hours are meant to be quiet, stated from 10pm, wasnt till after 3am that the upstairs guests, or what i assume is the roommate finally went quiet. TV didnt work, bed was very small and uncomfortable, bathroom floors were filthy and hadn't appeared to be cleaned in between guests, and floor mats hadnt been washed."

Stayed with kids","""The Loft"" was beautiful, modern, well-appointed, and extremely spacious. The décor was very nice while still being casual and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay. HOWEVER, this is not a 3 Bedroom. This is a ONE Bedroom with additional beds in the main living area (which includes the open kitchen, dining area, living area, game area, and 2 ""bedroom areas""). There are no walls on ""bedrooms"" 2 and 3, so plan accordingly. We stayed over a weekend and while Friday night was quiet, there was some fairly loud music (well, mostly just bass from in the Loft) from somewhere nearby until after midnight Saturday night. We put on some white noise and most of us were able to sleep through it. We would stay here again."

Stayed about a week","The accommodations were exactly as described. The rooms could be as bright as I wanted them. Cooking was convenient with all the necessary equipment. I was even able to grill. The bed was firmer than my preference yet welcoming. There was bad weather during my stay and was grateful to have a clean bright basement to seek shelter in. The steps are at a gradual angle so easy to manage.
I travel to Topeka for work often and will look to secure these accommodations again."

The house appeared to be well maintained and was very clean, putting me right at ease from the moment we arrived. Comfy beds, too!
The neighborhood is quiet and relaxing. I would absolutely recommend this location to anyone traveling to Topeka, and hope to stay again in the future."

The weather was great during our stay so we also took advantage of sitting outside at the back patio area. Highly recommend this cute, clean and cozy house!"

The neighborhood is nothing to write home about and there was a little noise from the neighbors in the middle of the night, but nothing huge. I had to clarify the sleeping arrangements in the second bedroom as I initially thought it was a twin AND a king, but it is a twin that converts. We were able to sleep everyone in our group, and the hosts were very responsive and clear when I reached out ahead of time to clarify. It’s a beautifully redone house!"

Few things to note is that the TV doesn’t have any live cable, you have to have an Amazon account to stream your own shows, movies, documentaries, etc. Another thing to note is the second bedroom (twin) only has a twin mattress that pulls out to a full bed. As listed, there is no King bed in that room.
Overall the stay in this house was wonderful, perfect for a 2 night stay!"

The house was even better than described - it was spotlessly clean, comfortable, and had reliable fast internet that was perfect for my remote work needs.
Christina and Patrick were great hosts - they communicated promptly and were always willing to assist with questions or issues that came up. The location was convenient to get to my family's home in just 10 minutes, and also close to nature trails, parks, restaurants, and shops.
The neighborhood was safe and the neighbors were friendly. For an extended stay, this home provided the perfect accommodations - it truly felt like home. Christina and Patrick have put thought and care into making their home inviting for guests. I recommend the home for anyone looking for a place to stay in the area whether it's for a short or long visit and would gladly stay again!"

It made packing up extra easy! The bed was very comfortable with lovely cotton linens. We really appreciated the many little things in the home that make traveling so much easier: bedside tables and reading lights, handy outlets, hooks for towels and clothes, luggage racks and empty surfaces to put our things on. The varieties of Starbucks coffee and Harney & Sons tea was really a nice touch and we enjoyed them. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","We were visiting family in the Topeka area, and this house was a great little place to stay. It is nicely updated throughout - very cute and clean.
For those with a kid/kids, the one “con” we had was how squeaky the floors were. The bedrooms were right next to each other, as well as the bathroom. My husband is an early riser (but my daughter and I like to sleep until 8am), and so every time my husband got up in the morning, the squeaky floors woke up our 4-year old. If your child is an early-rise or heavy sleeper, you shouldn’t have any issues though. :) Just something to note for parents looking to stay!
In any case, we would definitely come back and stay again. The hosts were great, and the home was quaint and comfortable!"

Stayed with kids","This house is absolutely beautiful. It’s a quiet two bedroom with a very open layout. The kitchen is nestled in the middle and was nice for cooking and keeping and eye on the little one. The dining room table was fantastic (super easy to clean!) and just nice and comfy for family meals. My son and I had so much fun playing in the backyard and watching fireworks (we were here for the 4th of July). The living room has a super comfy couch and two nice relaxing chairs. The bedroom we used for our son had a day bed that we just pulled out to make into a larger bed so he didn’t roll off. The bedrooms had so much natural light but were dark just as you would want at night. The mater bedroom had a ridiculously comfy king size bed with a tv in the room. The ikea cube storage made it easy and simple for clothing storage for the week. Someone said before the floor was loud and squeaky and while he’s older floors tend to be this way the squeak never woke my son or husband up during late night bathroom trips.
Christina and Patrick were quick to answer any questions we had and great communicators.
This house is lovely and we can’t wait to come back and visit."

Stayed one night","The location of the house was great. The house is beautiful inside and out. The larger bedroom had a very comfortable bed but the twin bed was very hard, it felt like a crib type mattress, not comfortable. We encountered a few issues. There were ants on the counter and the back splash. We attempted to have coffee in the morning but the coffee mugs had a chemical taste to them, not sure what they were cleaned with. The floor make very loud creaking sounds which is fine while everyone is awake, but at night they were so loud it woke the other two people up when one was getting up. There were not any instructions about the bedding. I looked through the long list of instructions that I received through the platform and the book but it only indicated what to do with the towels. You are advised to take your towels to the basement basket, which would be fine, but the steps are so steep and once I made it down there, the basket wasn't there. All in all the 1 day stay was pleasant, just a few things that were a little frustrating."

Stayed with kids","Bottom Line up Front: We enjoyed our stay, as painfully short as it was, as we stopped on our way across the country.
We generally look for a few things when looking at accomodations for a fsmily of 4 (includes 2 young kids), and this met our criteria.
1. The neighborhood is beautiful (with fully grown trees) and obviously hosts a lot of families. This is always a positive indicator.
2. There is plenty of entertainment for kids both in the house and nearby. In the house itself, caveat by saying I mean the TVs (kids each claimed one) and the backyard, which is gigantic compared to ours. Hosts also offered a list of suggestions in the local area. While we visited the park, we ran out of time (and energy) otherwise we would have tried the zoo.
3. Finally we found the house a comfortable space, all beds in the bedrooms were cushy for us and the kids, no complaints on the room setups, and we loved the kitchen setup and offerings.
Our hosts were very responsive and gave us everything we needed for a great stay, many thanks to Patrick and Christina for making our trip smooth!"

They have made the house a lovely, modern, comfy place where visitors can come in and feel they are home, and the attention to details have been done in excellence such as the brands of coffee, soap, cleaning and hair products. We will definitely return here on future trips to Topeka!"

There was a very very minor plumbing issue that the owner was VERY responsive to. They fixed it in the matter of minutes. It was a 5-star before…it was a 5+ after. These people are the people you want to work with!!"

Stayed with kids","We loved the house, it is newly updated and they really have considered everything with their stocking of the kitchen, laundry room, and linens-- lots of unexpected extras that made our stay with a family of 5 easy and comfortable.
Beds were comfy, the king bed was great even for side and stomach sleepers. Great pillows, too.
The kitchen was fully stocked, and we got to enjoy cooking and sharing a meal with family we were visiting (the first time 4 generations were together in 10 years!). We cook a lot when we travel and have never had a nicer, better stocked kitchen in an Airbnb, so that's a huge plus in my books!
The hosts were great at communicating, contactless check-in was a breeze, house rules and expectations were clear. It's located in what seems a pretty quiet, family oriented neighborhood walkable to Washburn Park and an easy drive to Gage Park where we went to the holiday Zoo Lights event.
The only caution for future guests is that the varnish smell from the renovations (at the time of our stay) was still pretty noticeable and could be bothersome to anyone sensitive to VOCs. We were able to open windows and run the ceiling fans in the bedrooms to help air it out and it didn't detract from our stay.
We would definitely stay here again!"
