Stayed a few nights",I had a great time visiting with my daughter while staying at Vern and Chris's charming place. The location was perfect for my needs. We were close to the river and were able to enjoy pleasant walks along the river. The space was very well maintained and the home and yard lovely. You can tell a lot of love and care are taken with the home. While on site I was very busy and did not get to interact with my hosts but there was nothing they did not anticipate and provide for a traveler. The location was easy to find and communication through AIRBNB was great. I would stay again and recommend to others.

As mentioned in a few previous reviews, there are times when you can hear the dogs/other noises within the main home, but this was not an issue/deterrent for us.

Stayed a few nights","The cabin room exceeded our expectations! I could immediately tell that Vern and Chris put a lot of thought and care into the place. We stayed in December and it was decorated for the holidays, which was a charming touch. Check-in was seamless with clear instructions. We checked in late and the pathway was lit up and easy to find at night.
The walls are thin and you hear them and their dogs at times, but they were mindful of their volume and they are transparent about it in the listing description.
I appreciated every single detail of the room to make their guests feel at home, and would definitely stay again if in the area!"

Our evening and morning walks by the river were very relaxing. We ordered take-out appetizers from Isabella's restaurant and enjoyed them on the covered patio while sipping a martini and watching Netflix. Vern and Chris were flexible when we wanted to stay an extra night! We'll definitely return when we can stay longer!

Stayed a few nights","A few of my favourite things from my stay….the cozy feel, the fireplace, the lit up outside staircase when I came home after dark, the rain shower head, all the ‘extras’ like coffee, snacks, utensils, labeled light switches and a very comfy mattress. It feels like if your mom set up a spot for you…lots of thought and care went into this space.
The only downside is that any voices, sounds and the dog carry through the walls although Vern and Chris are sensitive to it and clearly try to keep it down.
Thanks for a great place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Very convenient location to Selinsgrove or Susquehanna University. The hosts have thought of everything. The bed and shower are great, and there are thoughtful touches like snacks, bottled water, Keurig & coffee, and toiletries. Minor points: there's no couch to sit on if you're watching TV; their dog, though friendly, is pretty intimidating if you didn't know he was friendly; and natural light is very limited unless you want the blinds on the French doors open to the deck. (There is a very nice skylight, though.) The Saturday night car races were extremely loud, though onbviously the hosts can't control that. Vern and Chris were very friendly and our stay was very comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","What a perfect location to enjoy downtown Selinsgrove and surrounding areas. The loft was very tidy and full of charm with Chris's cute decor. It was nicely stocked with such kind unexpected things like coffee, tea, cups, snacks and cold waters. The bed was very comfortable and it had plenty of clean, soft towels. A lot of attention to detail. It shows how much the owners take pride in offering this space to guests.
A couple things to note if you're staying. This loft is attached to the owner's home and you do have to walk through their outdoor living area to get back and forth to your space. They also have a large German Shepard named Zeus who is cautious about new people. In addition, Vern has his work space under the loft and sometimes has early morning repairs to do which you can hear (and feel) from the loft area. It's to note being an early riser is helpful because the work area underneath may wake you up if you intend to sleep in a bit."

Easy to get to and close to everything, but off the beaten path so that having a relaxing weekend away is possible without sacrificing the convenience of restaurants and shopping close by. We loved our stay. The room was clean and had everything we needed for a weekend away. The bed was comfortable and the fireplace added a nice ambience. We would definitely recommend this home if you are looking for a cozy place to relax."

The place was immaculate, thoughtfully decorated, and the extra touches (snacks, coffee, creamer, utensils, water, shower supplies, etc) show how much pride Vern and Chris take in their place. The bed was super comfortable also. The little town right down the road was great also. I went to the Oyster Bar and enjoyed it a lot. The river is a two minute walk and the views were spectacular. I came here from Pittsburgh on business, but I will be coming back for a little getaway for peace and quiet soon. 10 out of 10!"

I walked down by the river and sat on the deck watching the sunset and flocks of geese heading south.
Many local restaurants for delicious food (BJ’s and Wicked Dog Grille) - also took advantage of the mini frig microwave.
The fireplace made it extra cozy and an abundance of hot water in the well-pressured shower.
I slept well in the very comfortable bed.
This is a very good value for all you get- most of all for me was lots of privacy."

They were easily accessible to anything we needed and had such cute touches in their AirBnB. We were even invited to swim and on the hottest day of the year wished we brought our suits! Lol!
Close to so many great restaurants, we tried BJs and Skeeters and both were excellent. We were sad we missed the local Selinsgrove brewery, Wicked Dog and Kind Cafe but due to limited hours and holiday weekend we may come back to try again!
Bed and TOWELS were so comfy and we are early risers so we didn’t mind the nice skylights, but it does get bright early in the morning, and the deck or various hammocks are perfect for coffee! Highly recommend."

The second floor room had a private entrance, with a deck overlooking cornfields where we relaxed on arrival and again with our take-out breakfast from the Kind Cafe. Our room was decked out with seasonal decor and thoughtful touches - very homey and comfortable. We took a walk through their quiet neighborhood along the river. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and wish we had discovered this years ago! Thanks, Chris and Vern."

Stayed a few nights","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! . I've been coming to Lewiwsburg/Selinsgrove area, annually for 25+ years to visit a very close friend. The Isle of Que is a very cool, quiet and quaint area, actually on a small island. Really, nice, cozy & private studio like accomodation, with vaulted ceiling and small 2nd floor couch/reading area - VERY comfy couch ... all in a very quiet area. If you're looking for solitude and a great spot to get away & relax, Vern & Chris' Cabin on the Que is a sure bet. Super clean, as advertised, new ""everything, large private 2nd floor outside deck overlooking peaceful countryside and cornfields, screened back French door to let evening breeze in, or flip on overhead fan or AC. The only thing that would brighten it up would be some windows, but 2 skylights help with that. Just 2 minute walk to Front St bordering the Susquehanna River, makes for relaxing, lovely walk any time of day. Little to no traffic here, as it's a long dead end road. A 10 minute walk into ""downtown"" Selinsgrove to 2 popular (& favorite) restaurants, or drive if you'd prefer. Quaint Lewisburg 15 or so minutes up Rt 11/15, and plenty of retail shopping minutes away in Shamokin Dam. GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY HERE! Prompt reply to any questions. Very accomodating."

Chris and Vern are very kind and you'll receive a warm welcome. Chris shows you the switches, lights, remote, and etc of the room and the amenities.
You will love their place its absolutely beautiful and sparkling clean. The freshness Bath and Body scent is absolutely amazing.
I forgot to ask what scent was in the bathroom.
Everything you need is there just bring your toothbrush.
We loved the area, very safe and many places to entertain yourselves. Fishing, boating, swimming within a block and additional wonderful areas within 5 to 6 miles .
Many selections of restaurant several blocks away or within a mile or 2 many more restaurants and a very large mall as well.
Our only gripe was we wished we could have stayed longer if I had taken more vacation time off of work then we would have booked longer stay."

For anyone doing a multi-day kayaking trip on the Susquehanna, Rob and Dixie's place on the Ilse of Que is a perfect location to spend the night and certainly beats camping! It is an easy walk into Selinsgrove for dinner, beer, and supplies."

It is ground level and there is another airbnb unit next to you that is separated by a locked door. It still feels really private and cozy though.
The pool area was very nice and clean with ample sitting and lounging space. It goes really deep too on one end which is nice! We really enjoyed having the pool on the last week of summer. Washer and dryer in the bathroom were also a huge bonus!
This is a beautiful area of Pennsylvania with gorgeous views of the river and a nice swinging bench to watch the water. It’s also only a couple minute drive to “main street” with walkable streets and cute stores/restaurants."

The yard is inviting with places to sit & enjoy the beauty (a little too chilly at this time of year… but the potential!) The accommodations were inviting- very comfortable, pleasant and cozy. We sat by the fireplace and read, walked along the river, and explored an antique shop and a thrift store. We did very little cooking, but had we wanted to, the kitchen was clean and well supplied with necessities. The bed was very comfortable. The host was friendly, smiling, and available if we had needed them.
We hope to return in the future. It was a lovely getaway and exactly what we were looking for."

Stayed a few nights","We arrived after the sun set so didn't get a look at the scenery until the next morning when we were greeted with a gorgeous view of the mist rising from the Susquehanna
as the sun was just starting to rise. Later that day had a lovely stroll along the river.
The space consists of the bathroom, bedroom, and a large room that has the kitchen, dining area, and very comfy living room and fireplace. There is a TV with streaming capability, but we chose to put on music, settle back in the very comfortable furniture, and read. We really appreciated the motion-activated light in the hallway that came on as we stepped out of the bedroom for nighttime trips to the bathroom! Other than a short step from the patio to the entry door of the unit, all is on a single level and so should be fine if someone had minor mobility issues. So, yes, it is a lovely, safe, and peaceful place to stay with a kind and hospitable host.
In case some wonder about sound transference between the guest suite and the family's living quarters upstairs, you do hear the odd footstep and the occasional murmur of voices overhead (where Rob and his family live}, but it was not disruptive or bothersome. I am very sensitive to sound and did not find it to be a problem. When outside you do hear a bit of the distant traffic on the highway, but when inside it is very peaceful.
We were there 2 nights and had to be up early and gone most of the day visiting a relative in a nearby town, but could see that the space would be ideal for a longer stay, too. The kitchen has just about anything one would need to prepare meals and there is a washer and dryer in the spacious bathroom. Outside there are several inviting spots to sit and read or chat.
We would absolutely stay again in Rob's lovely spot by the river! It was a treat.
Glenn and Sue"

It had a Keurig AND a french press for coffee! Great stove for cooking! Loved the kids and I got to watch movies with the TV subscriptions. The location cannot be beat! Selinsgrove is just the cutest little town! I loved sitting on the swing by the water. It was so relaxing. Rob met me coming in and opened the lock box for me and helped me check-in. He was a great communicator. I can't recommend this place enough.

The space is expansive with a kitchen, dining area and living room as well as the bed/bath/laundry. Outside there are many options to enjoy the environs.
Communication was perfect, everything was super clean, and all our expectations were met. We hope to be back!"

The location was perfect for a quiet, peaceful respite. We didn't bring our bikes but it would have been a perfect spot for that since the area is rather flat. We did a bit of shopping during our stay and the small shops downtown were interesting especially The Mustard Seed. The most important thing to say about this facility was the hosts. They didn't interfere with with our presence but were right there when we needed assistance with anything. Most grateful."

The apartment is just as pictured with everything you need (home away from home) ; you’ll have views of the river right from the living room; the pool was perfect, the swing areas outside to watch the river were my favorite thing! Down the street from the home is a dairy farm and my daughters loved walking there in the morning and evening to greet that cows! Don’t pass up on this place if your looking for relaxation, comfort and good amenities! Rob, Dixie and Kayla were supper nice, welcoming hosts! Can’t wait to come back my family and I had a real nice time here and you will too!!"

The place is delightful - cozy, clean, well-cared for, quiet and private. As advertised, it is right on the Susquehanna River, a beautiful spot. I can only imagine how lovely this location would be when the weather cooperated, especially in the Spring and Summer. The information sent to us beforehand was completely accurate and made checking in a breeze. Our host Rob was most helpful when we had difficulty with the WIFI, coming over to help us personally. All in all, an excellent choice for that getaway weekend or a longer stay."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed three nights at this apartment for a little mini-getaway and really enjoyed the area and the accommodations. The apartment was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. It is on the lower level of the main house, but I found it very quiet and private. I am sometimes a bit leery of staying in a guest suite rather than a completely separate dwelling, as I really value my privacy when away. However, Rob and his family are very considerate of their guests' privacy. I did not meet Rob while there but knew that he was available if needed, which was a great arrangement. The Isle of Que is a wonderful place to walk along the Susquehanna River and close enough to walk into Selinsgrove as well. All flat walking with lovely views of the river. If you are there in warmer weather, you can take advantage of the river deck and the outside furniture on the covered patio. Selinsgrove has some nice shops and restaurants and you are also not far from Lewisburg, another cute little town. So, overall, a very nice, well-maintained, and well-appointed apartment at a great value in a very unique and lovely location."

Stayed a few nights","This is a very special spot. My husband and I had a phenomenal time staying at Rob's place. It is located right on the Susquehanna River, and we spent every morning watching the sunrise on the deck that is right at the riverbank. IT was very clean and had plenty of towels and sheets. Downtown Selinsgrove is incredibly quaint and filled with lovely people--we recommend The Kind Cafe (the BEST food, get the Honey Bee panini!), the farmers market on Saturday mornings (make sure to get cookies by The Cookie Dude!), The Cottage on Pine (antique shop), Selin's grove Brew (great food), and Isle of Que Brew (great drinks). We also went on some great day hikes to Canyon Vista at World's End State Park and Rickets Glen State Park. Ard's Farm and Market was great for brunch and fall festivities. We are already dreaming about another trip:)"

Our hosts had no problem with our grandchildren visiting. The house was beautiful, very clean, and relaxing. It was also beautifully decorated. The kitchen was well supplied with breakfast items along with some very yummy pastries! There were brochures about area attractions. We took a driving tour of old covered bridges! Margie and Dave’s place is well worth the stay; we would recommend it! It is close to nearby universities, hospitals, beautiful parks, hiking trails, and Clyde Peelings Reptile Land . We would definitely stay there again. Great hosts and very nice Air B&B!"

They were very accommodating and responsive to questions and very kind hosts. The house was lovely and spotless. Our bed was comfy and we slept really well. Loved the extra touches of providing shampoo, conditioner and body wash as well as the other little toiletries, so helpful especially for someone as forgetful as myself. They even left us some breakfast treats from a local café and the kitchen was well equipped for anything else you might like or need. It was a rainy day so it was so nice to be able to use the garage to park my partner’s scooter out of the rain. We had a great stay and wouldn’t hesitate to stay at The Traveler again next time we are in the area. Thank you Margie and Dave for a lovely stay."

Stayed with kids","Although it has been a while since we stayed in an AirBnB, this was by far the best overall experience we've had!
I cannot say enough about the ""little things"" that made this overnight stay stand out ... from the subtle yet effective labels on everything so that there was no confusion or guesswork, to the extremely well thought out snack basket and delicious baked goods. Every thing that could have been needed was provided, and it was obvious the attention to detail and pride in ownership that Margie and Dave have.
My only regret is that we were only staying for a quick overnight. My wife and I are already thinking about other things to do in this area so that we can stay here again for a longer trip.
Thank you Margie and Dave,

Both Marie and Dave are incredibly responsive, kind, and supremely knowledgeable about the area.
Whether you're passing through central PA on a road trip, or visiting family nearby like we were, we cannot imagine a better place to rest and reconnect with a peaceful life on an adorable (and productive!) small farm.

Stayed a few nights","As an experienced Airbnb traveler, there are three things that make a great stay: the amenities you need, inherent charm, and a little something special. Marie’s place checks all the boxes. Marie has thought of everything you need, down to small details like a box of tissues and a lamp on EACH side of the bed, and a trash can in every room. These are small details, but they add up to an easy, comfortable stay. The charm comes from the farm animals (sheep and chickens and kittens-oh my!) and Marie herself, who gives such a warm welcome I felt like we were old friends. Finally, there are just some special touches that Marie provides (including the fresh eggs!!!). Like others, I hit the farm stand before leaving (which at Christmas-time was filled with goodies…my only regret is that I didn’t buy more ginger cookies). I recommend Marie’s Airbnb wholeheartedly and plan to stay there again in the future."

Just overall perfect aesthetics for what you would expect a small PA farm to be. There was even fresh farm eggs and bacon and (seasonal) peaches stocked in the fridge with bread for breakfast in the morning! Amazing. We unfortunately didn’t have the time to make breakfast, but it couldn’t have been a better “Welcome” gesture! We highly recommend and hope to go back when the opportunity arises!
… and don’t forget to sign the guest book! We did because we were in a hurry leaving. :( I guess that’s just another reason to go back!
Thank so much you Marie! It’s really beautiful there. ❤️"

Stayed one night","Dave and Marie were amazing hosts! We loved the fresh eggs, tomatoes, and peaches that they provided. There were also fresh grapes on the arbor behind the house. The farm was beautiful and the view from the hilltop was breathtaking! Bring your sneakers and take a tour of the property to see all of the animals. And don’t forget to look for the mouse house!"

Stayed one night","Dave and Marie were outstanding hosts. They made sure we felt at home as soon as we arrived on the property. They provided fresh eggs, drinks, and farm grown tomatoes. It was very enjoyable to see the farm and the animals. We loved the sheep, ducks, kittens, chickens, and cows. We would definitely return to this location in the future!
ps. Their dog, Lafayette, made the stay even better :)"

Stayed a few nights","Dave and Marie were excellent hosts. The apartment was exactly as it was in the advertisement. Beautifully decorated and very charming. It was nice being in the country and on the farm since that is where I grew up. It was like being home again. The kitchen was well stocked. And everything was neat and clean. The only thing was we did not get the Wi-Fi hooked up, but that could be, our problem. I plan to return in the future. I would highly recommend this place to say for one or two people. It is absolutely charming. And worth the money so much better than being in an hotel."

Stayed a few nights","This was the real deal, and we will love to go back and stay at Marie’s place whenever we are in the area. They have a lovely farm experience, with lots of animals around and fresh vegetables 🥗. We loved walking around the farm at dusk watching the fireflies and seeing all the ducklings. City folk who are looking for a farm experience will find it here.
I have been to a lot of AirBnBs and Marie’s was by far the best-equipped in terms of amenities and extras, which made it so easy to focus on our vacation and family instead of running around to stores trying to pick up any of those little things you forget to take.
Marie and Dave were wonderful hosts and were available to help find local activities and share their lovely accommodations with guests.
We felt right at home and will love to come back in the fall for the pumpkin-patch 🎃.

Windows were full size letting light in. Heating system worked perfectly with two wall units placed at opposite ends that were controlled separately. Hosts were very responsive.

Truly
refreshing farm and country scene.
Take a cup of coffee, sit and savor the quiet morning. This view is a plus for this home. Love the grapes vines!

The place does have a beautiful view, and Simon & Virginia were very thoughtful, leaving snacks and beverages for us to enjoy. Most importantly, they communicated clearly from the time I made the reservation and were very quick to respond to my questions. We were grateful for a good night's rest and an overall great stay."

Thoughtful snacks and water were provided. The bed was very comfortable. The shower/ tub had very good water pressure. We did not use the kitchen, as we only stayed one night. It was very clean.

Even got to spend some time sitting on the patio enjoying the mini goats and the mini horses. They prepared a lovely little basket of treats and left beverages for me as well. And they offer different size pillows for different tastes. Very accommodating. Very thoughtful. The only drawback was the noises coming from upstairs. Other than that, the area is indeed a wonderful place for getting away from it all."

The snacks and drinks left were such a nice touch and we were thankful for the room darkening curtains in the afternoon when the kids took naps. A great price and my husband loved sitting on the patio overlooking the valley. Defiantly will be returning if ever in the area again

We enjoyed the porch, morning and evening, and the quiet was good for the soul! The snacks they offer are a delightful personal touch! And made so that I didn’t need to pack as much. We loved that there was no distraction offered by a tv. The hosts were very responsive and great with communication."

There is no television; however, the inspirational messages more than make up for it. Although we have respect for others and their culture, it was a little over the top for people who do not have the same spiritual/belief system.
Would consider staying here again if the occasion presented itself."

This isn't typically what one imagines for a honeymoon, and it was perfect. All we needed was groceries. The breezes, the views, the quiet, the calm, the cute pony out back... We had great coffee, homemade treats, and snacks upon arrival. It felt like we were visiting family, and you can't fake that. The space was spotless, it's so pretty, the bed was comfy, the water pressure and temperature was great, and we got in the car once during our 4 day stay for takeout at Siam (delicious and large portions, be prepared) and ice cream at The Purple Cow (they have much more than ice cream, too). It was hard to leave, but easy to say we'll be back."

I will also note that Simon and Virginia were the only hosts that specifically mentioned the additional precautions they've taken during the pandemic. Their space is immaculately clean and their careful consideration is apparent. The patio provides a wonderful view, though I would note you'll take in the sights and sounds of a working poultry farm. There is not a TV and the WiFi is best in the living space, but if you're looking for a comfortable, rural experience, I would highly recommend."

Their thoughtfulness also moved me as I checked into the place because they turned on AC and kept the place cool for us prior to our arrival. The bed was so comfortable, and the view outside the entrance is just relaxing and peaceful. About 10-15 minute short drive, several restaurants offered pick-up orders (During COVID-19) and grocery stores as well. If you are for a quiet and relaxing getaway trip from city life, I highly recommend this place."

Even though photos are lovely on-line, they don't capture the whole experience of not only the adorable, well-stocked, extremely clean apartment -- but their property and the surrounding countryside. The private patio offered spectacular views of rolling green hills, mountains and an abundance of nature entertainment! The warmth and hospitality of both Virginia and Simon could not have made our stay any more perfect! The full apartment --with Wi-Fi! - and patio were private, yet Virginia and Simon were very accessible and accomodating to any questions or requests. Recommended is quaint downtown Lewisburg, only 10 minutes away and Bucknell Golf Club in Lewisburg, a maticulously maintained course, worthy of the experienced golfer."

As for the space, super clean and cozy and my mother is a clean freak so if she thinks a place is clean... it’s clean!

There are a lot of religious items (CDs, books, etc) as well as Biblical quotes or other materials on the walls, and really everywhere you looked. We even received a gift bag that included a religious CD and books. If that is not your thing, be prepared in advance to tune it out. I believe that Mr. Bender, who was a gracious host and seems like a kind man, sees his hosting guests as a form of ministry. Be aware also that he does not allow alcohol or smoking, including outside, which is certainly his prerogative."

I rented this Airbnb for my cousin and I as we had a guided fishing trip scheduled. I was wanting the trip to be special and memorable as my cousin and I love to fish and don't get to spend much time together. This cabin helped complete the perfect week.
The area is great, close to town but also isolated just enough to chill out on the back porch and enjoy nature. We could not have chosen a better place to stay. You get more than what you pay for which is a rarity in today's world.
We got very lucky, and I was honored to be a guest of this host.

We mostly stayed on the property, taking full advantage of the beautiful and serene surroundings. My son was in the creek in the easily accessible kayaks every day. It was very close to everything you’d need(shops, restaurants etc) yet felt like you were tucked away in the middle of nowhere which gave the best of both worlds. Would highly recommend and would love to return and stay longer next time!!"

We were able to use the fire pit when it wasn’t storming or too hot. When it was too hot or humid we enjoyed the cozy air conditioned cabin. It seems like you are in a rural area at the cabin but it is just a few miles from Selingsgrove."

My family spent an entire day swimming, kayaking and fishing in the river and having a bonfire. The cottage is equipped with every need possible. Perfect place to rest and reset. Enjoying the daily wildlife of deer, geese, birds, chipmunks and jumping fish made for a great morning coffee entertainment.
The kitchen was fully equipped to cook meals. The owners provide fantastic games for the family to play. Lots of space to relax and unwind.
The local store Heimbach's is a great, I suggest ordering cupcakes. Delicious! A large chain grocery store is about 3 miles away.
For a cute afternoon activity we played putt putt near by at Susquehanna Sports Complex.
The cottage is located nicely near Knobels and Hershey Park. Off the beaten tourist path.
We truly enjoyed our time and plan to back."
