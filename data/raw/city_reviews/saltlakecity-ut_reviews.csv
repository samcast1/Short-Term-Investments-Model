Stayed a few nights",This place is located in a nice quiet neighborhood near walkable restaurants! I was nervous because it was my first solo trip I’ve ever done and I’m glad I chose this location. It’s super safe too! If I ever come back to Utah I would stay here again. The place has everything you need and it’s super clean as well. I greatly recommend this spot for anyone! Thank you for having me!

Stayed a few nights","The truth is all excellent as described, no more no less. The mattress on the bed very good, as well as the pillows, that is rare to find and makes a difference. Thank you.
The only comment is about the bathroom, that the bathtub smelled bad and I think it's the curtain.
Same the apartment I recommend ventilating it earlier.
Everything else is very good!! Clean, full equipment, you don't need any more."

Stayed a few nights",We stayed here 4 nights visiting our son at the University and skiing Park City. Location was great. Apartment is VERY clean and well maintained. We added our son on to our stay and the manager was very agreeable. FYI the sheets for the sofa bed are in the kitchen cabinet by the counter stools. The bathroom is very tiny and there is no space for clothing or luggage. We put our suitcases on the floor under the LR TV. The kitchen was just right for our needs. We cooked breakfast only. It was a little noisy between the person above us and the large construction project across the street. We did not pay to park but found street parking on the side streets. Not sure why parking is an added charge and would hope they just include it in the cost.

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the cleanest AirBnb properties where I have stayed. The bathroom and bedroom are tiny and there is no room for luggage, but for our intended purpose - staying in bed all weekend and watching TV, it was perfect. Be sure to pay the extra $10 a night for the garage space. At least on the weekend, parking on 100 South was not an option (no empty spaces) and we ended up on either 400 East or 500 East. Not terrible, but we wished we'd gotten the garage. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights",This little apartment was perfect for our stay in SLC while visiting family. It's super clean with lots of light and a nice view. It's a great jumping off point for walking the city. I had to leave early and my husband was there. He had to call for help with the washer machine and they(the owner and the maintenance worker) were incredibly responsive and took care of the issue immediately. Not only that....they are just incredibly good people. We really can't recommend Lake City Flats enough. We visit SLC periodically and will definitely stay again. Thanks so much for providing such a perfect home away from home!

Stayed a few nights","This home was very cozy and clean, with lots of natural light through their big windows. Perfect space for 2 people. Spotless clean, not a single speck in sight. Room is very small, not much walk around space or areas to set down items. The bathroom was very modern and cute, definitely small sink with little to no sink space. Bed was definitely comfortable and we slept amazing. Instructions on getting in were clear, but we had a confusing time finding the actual building due to our GPS.
Garages to park are very narrow, so I would plan extra time to find street parking if you have a SUV/Truck. Hosts were very friendly and responsive? and even let us know our unit was ready a few hours earlier than promised. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is quiet and I felt like I was close enough to everything. Even though I didn't use the kitchen much, it had all the essentials. Offstreet parking available for a fee. The apartment is recently renovated and maintained well. Lake City Flats were very responsive and even delivered a hair dryer when I noted there was not one!
Just note that there are no elevators and you'll need to carry luggage up a flight and a half.
This was perfect for me as a solo traveler, but the bedroom and bathroom are super tiny (very little space for storage or to even keep a suitcase open in the room). Would suit more than one person, just keep in mind luggage will probably be in the living room."

We had trouble finding the guest bed linens and the host was super responsive to help us find them.
This place doesn’t have any character, it’s classic cookie cutter Airbnb with bleached white sheets but it does the trick."

Stayed a few nights","The place was as described aesthetically, and is in a great location to get around SLC. However, the extra charge per person was strange for an Air BNB and daily parking rate charge, especially since it wasn't disclosed until AFTER we had booked. The No visitors or Noise was a bit strict and felt strange being told we were being watched and that the neighbors will report any visitors and you could possibly be kicked out in the middle of the night—no locks on any internal doors so limited privacy in the bedroom. The stay was overall a bit stressfull."

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful stay in this apartment. The kitchen/living room area was great. The kitchen was very well appointed including a coffee grinder and machine that makes espresso from pods which were supplied. Internet was screaming fast (like 500 Mbit both up and down). Had a Roku TV in the living room and in the bedroom. The owner is the most responsive AirBnB owner that I've rented from. The bathroom has a very small sink. If my wife was with me, this would have been more difficult to deal with than I'd like. They offer parking for $10/day which is needed if you can't get out of the street parking every day before a ticket would be issued. The parking is in a 1-car garage in an open area of 1-car garages for the building. You get in with a key they provide in a lock-box. There isn't an electric garage door opener which would have made the parking experience better. All in all, a very nice place to stay, in an excellent location."

The building is a little hard to see at night since there are no lights in front of the building. There’s no elevator and you have to walk up 2 flights of stairs to the unit so just be aware of carrying your things! There was lots of free street parking in front as well.
A great stay if you’re visiting SLC!"

The bedroom is so so so comfortable- the mattress is plush, bedding is soft and the tv is in your face (just the way I like it). The living room is done tastefully and the kitchen is spectacularly clean with professional touches. It’s very well equipped. I had my dog with my and out morning walks were grassy and fun! Would 20/10 recommend you stay here if you’re passing through SLC! Also oh, they send a long list of great food recs that were super helpful. We loved publik coffee for its rustic industrial vibe and pretty bird for its hot chicken."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay here! It is a studio apartment with a great view of the mountains - exactly as pictured. We had a short stay so we didn’t use all of the kitchen amenities, but they did seem to have some basics. The place was clean, easy to find, and quiet. They have a very detailed guest book that answered all of our questions and provided recommendations, which we found very helpful. It was close to downtown, but I wouldn’t say it’s walkable, and didn’t feel like a walking city. We rented a car so this was not a problem for us. Note there are no blackout curtains, and there are city lights that come through. We always travel with an eye mask, so I’d recommend this for others if you are sensitive to light. Also, even though we turned off the A/C, there was still a constant humming sound that could be bothersome to some. We weren’t in the room much, so it was fine for us. Overall, it was a great stay!"

This was also close to a conference I was attending so that was a plus as well. There is a large gym and working space on the top floor that I utilized throughout my stay. The in unit washer/dryer was a big plus. Some things I would mention are a few extra things such as a dish-drying rack, dish sponge, extra toilet paper, and extra blankets would have be helpful and added to my stay. Overall, a clean and comfortable place."

Stayed a few nights","my stay was fine for my quick salt lake city trip. here are my pros and cons
cons first any explanations:
- stood outside the door unable to get in for 45 minutes. (but they worked on getting me inside the unit fast)
-the vacuum smelt of urine and the smelled lingered. once i found it i cleaned it myself and it wasn't a bother.
- homeless and transients and those severely affected by mental illness prowl in the area. i had a young man follow me and scream at me that i would be ""getting killed tonight i watch you"". sketch
PROS- building has great safety to get in and out, lot security and i felt safe inside my unit
- an extremely nice bed.
-cute aesthetic
-washer + dryer were clutch!
-felt at home
-the city view is not good, but had some mountain view so it worked out for me
even with the slightly sketch neighborhood, i would stay there again but i'm used to aggressive homeless, as i'm from denver. but i think i would consider this place as an option B or C first."

Stayed one night","Kay's airstream was a clean and comfortable place to stay. Two highlights for me were the EV charger, fast for a home charger, and the ability to stream music through the built in bluetooth speakers in the airstream. Off street parking with plenty of space for one car is a bonus in SLC. The airstream is definitely compact compared to staying in a home, though for 1 or 2 people it is quite comfortable. It was one of the cleanest airbnbs I have stayed in, and the bed was comfortable. The only mild downside to the camper was that the wifi speed was rather low. It was not sufficient for video calls or loading graphic intensive webpages. Possibly due to being in a large metal cylinder. Overall, I was happy with my stay and would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","It is the ideal place if you are going to ski in Brighton or Solitude. The ski bus is very conviently located. It is also a very nice neighborhood. The room is clean and comfy, but it can be a little bit cramped if there are two people. There will be a traffic jam if both people need to pass through the hallway. My wife is complaining that the shower room is cramped, but as a 6' person who is used to hold the shower head while showering, I found it perfectly fine standing straight.
However, it is absolutely fantastic to have a spa tub waiting for you 24 hours. Hot water in the tub 24/7.
The host is also very nice and helpful, respond very quickly, and answer all my questions during my stay. Instructions are also very detailed."

Additionally we had some issues with the door not completely closing and locking however we never felt unsafe or anything like that, like I mentioned previously it was very private and peaceful. Other than that our stay was great and I would 100% book again! Kay and her team were very responsive and always willing to help out, definitely recommend :)"

Temp control was easy and lighting was super cool. Probably pretty standard for an Airstream but just generally a very cool experience at a great price point, what else could you ask for?"

The only complaint I'd have is that the airstream was insanely hot when first entering. During the summer time just be prepared for that, but other seasons I'm sure it's no issue at all. It did cool off fairly quick once the AC got turned on though. I would recommend this AirBNB to anyone!!"

It was one of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had, and that’s coming off a week plus of staying in different Airbnb’s for a national park trip throughout Utah. Everything was as described, super clean and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The hot tub was also super relaxing, clean and easy to use. It’s a a great location between SLC and park city, but very close to cottonwood canyon if you’re looking to ski Brighton/solitude or Alta / snowbird. Don’t be turned off by this being an airstream trailer, it was a huge plus in our opinion, practically brand new and squeaky clean. I would call out that you are parked in (I believe) the owner’s driveway, but they do a good job of making it feel peaceful and private."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for unique, quiet, great host, easy access to skiing on the wasatch front, hot tub, clean, cute as a button, private, did I mention clean?, Uber comfortable bed, calm, peaceful, restorative place….this is it. I Airbnb regularly and I have to say that this is at the top of the list. I am local to the area and just needed a getaway for me and this was great. Sat in the hot tub while snow fell and it was pretty magical. I’m I super snooty when it comes to mattress comfy-ness and I slept like a baby. Kay has everything you need from a fully stocked kitchen (electric water kettle was full and ready to go!) to ear plugs and chocolate by the bed. This is how an experience should be. And how magical to stay in an airstream??? If you want cozy, well appointed, great host interaction, hot tub, and comfy, quiet sleeping, go ahead and stay here. And don’t be a bad guest. Kay has put a lot of effort into making this place great."

We couldn’t get the door to lock, and yet one day when we came home the trailer door was locked and we couldn’t get in with our key. I reached out to Kay and pretty quickly a man came from the main house to unlock the door. He was very rude and seemed incredibly bothered to need to do this. We tried explaining the troubles we were having with the key to him and he was dismissive and walked away telling us we were “crazy if we thought anyone would get in there”. I don’t think it’s unreasonable of us to want to be able to lock the trailer given we had all of our ski gear and other valuables (laptops, etc.) with us."

Stayed a few nights","So often an ad only captures the best parts or sells a better picture than reality - not in this case. It was amazing in the ad but even better in person. Rest assured you will not be let down. The service of the host was better than any hotel, responsiveness was unmatched, the efficiency and ease was so relaxing. The Airstream was more luxurious than my own home. It was the most comfortable sleep. Advice: read the instructions and directions; little things like the hot water, hot tub and tub are easy if you take two seconds to read the guides they provide. There was a lot of foot traffic around the airstream, but the shades are more than enough. The wifi was great and it was so close to the ski slopes."

Had a nice time, Kay was friendly and welcoming. I’d highly recommend for those looking to explore the mountains Southeast of Salt Lake City."

Stayed a few nights","Kay is an excellent host, and I had a fantastic stay. There are three things in particular that made this a 5-star visit:
1. Great Airstream
Airstreams are classic…but can be hit or miss. This is an absolute hit. The trailer is new with modern appointments like multiple TVs, a huge bathroom, and other conveniences. It was perfectly clean and cozy. And to top it off, the hot tub outside offers a great way to relax after a day of skiing.
2. Perfect location
Are you in SLC to ski? The Airstream is half a block from the 972 bus stop, which services Brighton and Solitude. Not only that, but since you’ll get on the bus before two of the big park-and-rides, you’re sure to get a seat.
3. Kay’s friendliness and responsiveness
Without question, Kay is one of the nicest and most responsive Airbnb hosts I’ve ever met. For instance, when a space heater shorted out, she had a replacement within the hour.
This was an all-around perfect visit. I’ll be back for sure."

Kay and her staff were very fast to respond to any questions or issues I had. The only issue was that I lost heat in the airstream one night. Kay’s staff were able to deliver more propane early in the morning however I couldn’t help but wonder why the tank wasn’t full to begin with.
Ultimately their response was generous and I would stay again. They held my luggage for me well beyond my checkout time which was a really nice gesture."

Little things like provided shampoo and conditioner, tea and coffee, a kettle to heat the water, little mints, candies and earplugs next to the bed, or details that put the icing on the metaphorical cake.
The check in instructions are easy and thorough, the hosts are also incredibly responsive to communication in the event it is required.
It just feels very professionally run through and through, and we had a great time.
Last thing! I wasn’t sure whether or not we would be cold in an airstream in the winter, and we were absolutely fine! There is plenty of bedding to go around, the heat works excellent, and if none of those suit you, there’s a bonus space heater.
Great place, would recommend."

The location of the airstream felt very private. The airstream itself was filled with all the amenities you could want. There was even a towel heater in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the controls for everything inside were very intuitive.
A word of warning for tall people. It was a bit difficult for me to use the shower as I could not stand up straight. I suspect this wouldn't be an issue if you were shorter than 6 feet.
Another thing of note is that the door is very difficult to latch you have to pull/push it very hard to get it to click.
Ultimately we really enjoyed staying here and would love to stay again if it weren't for the shower height."

Definitely recommend for anyone that wants to get out of the regular Hotel scene. Even though it's located next to a home, it still felt very private and overall is in a nice area.
The only complaint is the wifi for us at least was spotty. Netflix struggled and would work in and out on our phones in the morning. luckily we didn't really 'need' WiFi but of course nice to have. But honestly I know how to things go with WiFi so it really couldn't just been a bad night for it. Really wasn't enough to deter us from wanting to book again in the future."

The location is easy to get to and from the mountains and the city. The hot tub was welcome after long powder days on the slopes. Lezlee was super responsive any time I had a question, but I didn’t have many!"

Stayed a few nights","This Airstream could not be better located--easy access to both the Big and Little Cottonwood canyons, as well as being in easy reach of Whole Foods, the state liquor store, and a dozen or more dining destinations of varying types (our favorite was the Persian food at Sumac Cafe--fall off the bone tender meat). The Airstream was clean, tidy, well-appointed, and situated as to give privacy. The kitchen in particular had every thoughtful touch, whether dishes, glasses, coffee pods in every conceivable flavor, etc., etc. The hot tub was wonderful. The mountain views were gorgeous. Communication was nearly instantaneous and outstanding. For two people, this couldn't be beat. (Theoretically, there is room for at least two more people. I wouldn't recommend it. Airstream life is cozy.) I doubt there's better value in the valley than Lezlee's place."

Stayed a few nights","I'm so glad I booked this airstream. I was hesitant at first concerned about being cold, small etc. I was blown away by how nice this place is! The heating is beyond excellent, and the airstream is really well designed for space. It has modern finishings, granite counters, wifi, televisions, hot shower, spacious bathroom. It was super cool experience. It was also really nice not to be in a hotel commingling during covid. The private hot tub for my exclusive use after big days skiing was a gift. Very close to LCC, it took me 15 min driving to park at Alta. *Note: you need to make parking reservations ahead of time for Snowbird* Forget the Cliff Lodge, this is the place to stay! I will only book here going forward."

Stayed one night","Such a cool place! The Airstream is located about a 20 minutes drive from downtown Salt Lake. Nice neighborhood. Technically it is on its own street, but it just looks like a driveway off the main road. Be sure to follow the check in procedures to make sure you can easily find the right place.
It was easy to check in, and we didn’t have any in-person interaction which is what we wanted during covid. The airstream is located in the main houses driveway, but there is a privacy screen by the hot tub, and felt perfectly private.
Can’t say enough how cool the Airstream is! Especially the bed which felt amazingly spacious and luxurious. You’ll just have to poke around to figure out how everything works - which was actually a lot of fun.
We liked it so much we stayed twice, on our way to and from our destination. Lezlee and the booking company were very communicative and helpful. Everything felt luxurious and surprisingly spacious, I highly recommend!"

I didn't do any cooking, so can't vouch for the cooking/cookware situation, but appliances are new. The combo washer/dryer actually got the job done, which isn't always the case for those units. The immediate neighborhood isn't pristine, but totally adequate, and you're really close to downtown, so overall, location is pretty darn good."

There’s a great common space area to work from that i was able to utilize that was basically empty. A really great fitness center and the apartment views were unreal. Just out the window the mountains look amazing. Super easy to get to the fairgrounds and easy to get in and out. Really a steal.

It’s right off the freeway so it takes no time to get anywhere in the slc area you would like to go! It is also in the very homeless area of slc. But it’s not really that big of a deal, if you are used to bigger city’s you probably won’t think much off it. The only thing that was a bit funky was the bed. It was a memory foam bed so it was hard sometimes and then hot and also a bit hard on the back but that might have just been my specific experience, because I know a lot of people really love memory foam beds. Everything else was fantastic! And the space is very cute with absolutely everything you need! And very very clean! We will stay again!"

Hot tub was mostly cloudy even before we used it. Though the maintenance people came daily. We used the hot tub on our last day which was nice. There was a parking lot right next to the fence with semi privacy screens.
All in all, would recommend for a couple. Just know that it'll be a tight and cozy squeeze."

The apartment felt safe and secluded and was decorated very cute. We enjoyed the hot tub and it was pretty clean besides having some debris in it. We had everything we needed for our one night stay and the bed and pillows were amazing! My only complaint was that the apartment had a smell in the living room, I never could figure out exactly what it was so maybe it was just due to the age of the home?

The private hot tub definitely topped everything off for us and we loved having Kay be so responsive whenever we needed her! I also want to just add that some air bnb’s have really uncomfortable beds and I get anxious not knowing if I’ll get a good nights rest or not. Bed and bed sheets made me feel like I was on a cloud!

One thing to note if you drive a large vehicle (we drive a Ram 3500 long bed) is that the designated parking space is a very tight turn. Not a problem but something to be prepared for especially if arriving in the dark.

Stayed one night","TRAVELER BEWARE!
In the explanation it never mentions a sofa bed and they show a picture of the same bed with 2 different covers (and from different angles) making it appear that that there are 2 separate beds and it looks like 2 rooms (it’s only 1 room and somehow I missed that but to my defense the images we intentionally put to make people think there are 2 beds and what looks like 2 rooms) We didn’t figure that out until we got there. Also the sofa bed was HORRIBLE, it was slanted and uneven. I can’t believe that we were charged an additional $60 for 2 extra people to sleep on the sofa bed lol. This has been my worst Airbnb experience to date. To their credit, the bbq didn’t work and when I messaged them they were quick to respond and help us get that fixed."

Stayed a few nights",Our stay was amazing! The house is so cute! The location was perfect… really close to everything. The hot tub was a great addition. They have EVERYTHING you’ll need. The only thing I would say is the bathroom is a little small so it would be difficult for more than two people… especially us girls who use a lot of room to get ready. Other than that it was perfect!

Although it was very hot outside, we still were able to enjoy the hot tub both at night and during the day thanks to the plentiful shade in the backyard. The only downside is it wasn’t as quick or easy to walk to places downtown as we initially thought, but that might just be due to Salt Lake being a more spread out downtown area. Having a car is recommended."

Walkable to a pastry shop, Einstein’s Bagels, a wine bar and restaurants. Her home is so comfortable and welcoming. My husband loves the extra touch she puts in - of having a “Utah mint chocolate candy” on the bed for us upon arrival. So easy to communicate with as well. Lorena’s home will be our “go to place” when we visit our daughter in SLC!"

Side note: as we walked this morning to the cafe we passed an elementary school where the kids stopped and pointed at my dog and one yelled ""CORGI!!!"" at the top of her lungs and another asked if he could pet him. So my dog got to be a minor celebrity in her neighborhood!"

The queen-size bed was very comfortable; there was huge closet space and a big dresser too. The living/kitchen area was well-equipped and a great place to relax. And the bathroom is amazing---huge shower and tub. We had access to Lorena's wonderful backyard. Lorena is warm and welcoming and so responsive as a host. We loved her sweet rescue hound and her cat too. The apartment is within walking distances of great restaurants and a grocery store. We were there in the fall, but the ski slopes are only 30 minutes away. I would recommend this place to anyone!"

The bottles of water in the fridge were so appreciated late in the evening after a long day of driving. The bed is super comfy and the fan was a nice touch. My only complaint would be the difficult nature of finding street parking late in the venting after dark. Thank you for the last minute booking and providing a comfortable place to stay.

Stayed with a pet","If you're on the fence about Lorena's space, I would encourage you to stop debating and take the leap! This spot is a downstairs suite in a shared home that shares an entrance. Everything was exactly as described, and Lorena went above and beyond in kindness and hospitality. The space provided a great sized living area, kitchen, bedroom, and a bathroom just across the hall. There was coffee, tea, snacks, cooking utensils, and all the basics you might want or need. Additionally, as you'll read in all the other reviews, Lorena's shower/bathub setup was incredible. Soaking size tub, with jets, walk-in shower! AND bubble bath, bath salts, face wash, shampoo/conditioner options, the works. It was the most relaxing thing to enjoy after a day on the trails or just because. This spot was also dog friendly, in a great and very walkable neighborhood, and excellently priced. Above everything, Lorena was so respectful and accommodated my weird hours as a photographer and early hiker. Book it!"

Stayed with a pet","This studio with a bedroom is lovely cozy place that one enters through stairs down at the back of the house. Windows give it some natural light and the area downstairs with living space and bathroom is private (there is also a laundry room that one can likely request to use if needed). The bathroom is very large and detailed with black and white tiles. While the kitchen is well stocked with pans, coffee maker, toaster, rice cooker, mini fridge … the space is a bit small for much cooking. The lower level, high ceilings and central A/C means it’s cool even on a hot summer day. The location is excellent if you want a quiet, friendly neighborhood that is walkable to a lovely park and commercial area with bookstore, ice cream, bakery and a few restaurants. The spaced worked well for our dog (as long as it doesn’t mind stairs) as the neighborhood is a joy to walk around and the park is nice space with dog area as well as wonderful more natural area."

Didn't get a chance to use the jet streamed bath tub, but had we been there a bit longer we would have. Lorena and her whole fam were super warm and welcoming, and her dogs were lovely.

Stayed with a pet",Lorena sent us good instructions and was quick to reply. She also shared places nearby to eat. We were surprised the bathroom was across the open hallway and not within the suite. It does not have a lock on the door. This will keep us from staying here again. Not easy for unpacking if the driveway is blocked. The neighborhood is quiet.

There are a lot of books to read, if you wish, as well as television and puzzles. I didn't use the jetted tub, but the shower setup is very nice. I'll be looking to see if the place is available next time I'm in Salt Lake City and needing a place to stay."

Stayed one night","The bed is comfy, you have access to the kitchen, and the shower is hot. I liked the off street parking that felt secure. I was in room 2. Room 1 was vacant and room 3 was occupied. The walls are thin. Bring earplugs in case your neighbors are as noisy as mine were. The space and bathroom are clean, but not spotless…you are sharing with other people and they may or may not be conscientious of cleanliness. There is a lock on the bedroom door, thankfully. I noticed that the kitchen has a blender, a nice touch. The pots and pans are pretty scratched, and if you cook there it should be minimal."

Stayed a few nights","Parking was an issue. For a place the host up to 4 people. If all of them have their own cars, then you will have major parking issues. The owner parked in the middle of their driveway so you couldn't even park there if you wanted to. Each of our cars at one point were asked to move from where we parked in the public street. The bathroom still had hair in the bathtub. The bedding had hairs on it and under pillows that were curly and we don't have curly dark hair. There were extra pillows, yet they are very flat but not extra blankets. I like to sleep with heat at 65 with warmth from blankets. The comforter was not warm and there was no extra blankets. The host did bring more down but they were twin size not queen size like the be was. The kitchen widow could really use a blind on it so for those of us that don't want to be seen into. The set up worked well for the space and price. The heat turns on and off and on and off until it get to the heat set."

Due to our host’s phone re-charging and problems with door bells, check-in was nerve-wracking as I couldn’t reach her for almost an hour and she doesn’t give the code out in advance as I e experienced in other stays. With two small children tired after their first plane ride, we were all glad she was home, and she very kindly explained the reasonable phone snafu.
The amenities were sparser than I’ve seen at other places of equal decor and location, but overall, I recommend this spot to anyone traveling to the SLC area. Debora is very kind and her place is a gorgeous gem!"

Stayed one night",Cute little place on the inside!! Little small but worked fine for us. Getting bags inside required a little bit of effort as I had a rolling suitcase and we had to walk through the grass and down a set of stairs. We did hear some movement from the floor above us quite early in the morning as the owners were moving around upstairs. I think they were trying to be quiet and respectful but that’s just how the house is made. The beds were super clean and comfortable! And they left us a little snack treat on the kitchen counter! :) over all great stay for the price we paid :) thank you!

The space was updated, there’s a private entrance, the beds were really comfortable & the home is only about 15/20 mins from the city. Perfect for our weekend!"

Check in was easy and we love how the basement airbnb entrance was right as you walk through the front door. Would definitely recommend this airbnb!

Stayed with kids","Debora and her mother who was supposedly visiting were extremely kind and welcoming. Besides that, the entire experience was a waste of money. We had several issues with our stay. We were moving across the country with all our possessions packed in our vehicle and a 5x8 trailer. Before we booked we asked if it was a safe area and where we could park our trailer. We were told we could park our trailer in the backyard but then we’re requested to just park in front of the house and no assistance was given or offered to park the trailer. We were assured it was a safe neighborhood but many of the houses had bars on the windows and we did not feel comfortable leaving all our possessions out front and upon driving around it didn’t seem it was ever even possible to get to the backyard to park it so we were lied to get the room filled. There was a lot of noise coming from the upstairs and my husband is a disabled veteran with PTSD so it made him uncomfortable to hear all the stomping around, to the point he could not sleep. The beds were not touching the wall and my daughter tried to sit back on the bed and almost fell. We could hear talking upstairs from several people and we didn’t feel like there was any privacy for us to speak over a whisper without being heard by those upstairs. We tried to shut the door to minimize the noise but then there was an unpleasant noise upon doing so, like a whistling wind noise as the air struggled to circulate. We also ended up taking freezing cold showers, probably because of the several people staying upstairs, which is terrible for my husbands injured back. The tub stopper did not work so we couldn’t bathe our daughter. Debora’s husband was irritated and made a comment about my husband going in and out when we were packing up the car and we were doing so an hour and a half before quiet time. Someone also ran down to lock him out one of the times he went outside then lied and said they were making sure it was unlocked for him. The lack of transition strip to the bathroom is a hazard and should be fixed immediately, especially when children are allowed in the rental. My daughter almost busted her face open falling on it, had I not been behind her to catch her, she would have gotten seriously hurt. This place is newly remodeled, but it wasn’t done professionally, which would be fine except for the hazards and lack of privacy. This rental is awkward and cramped, besides the kitchen area which is oversized compared to the rest."
