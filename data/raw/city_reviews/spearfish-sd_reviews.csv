Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stay at a boondocks BlackHills cabin, with solar lights and little else, so we really appreciate Tracey's sweet apartment with hot water and super fast wifi, for a quick clean up and connect. The kitchen has everything you need (cooking in is mainly our style, although there are several restaurants within walking distance). We stay every year, and everything slways goes super smooth (even the stairs, lol). Easy to park, check in, very clean, and communication with Tracy is always excellent. Thanks again for another wonderful downtown historic Spearfish experience. Aloha, Rebecca&Dave"

Stayed with kids","This place was one of my favorite AirBnBs we have ever stayed in. Comfortably appointed and extremely conveniently located. I loved the vaulted ceilings with pressed tin tiles, and the big soft bath towels and cloths. We had a blast teaching our five year old how to play Monopoly with the local edition, and the brewery two blocks away does a great beer flight. I highly recommend this lovely downtown loft."

Stayed with kids","This loft was a cute downtown night on our long trip.
They do not want pets because of the lofts gorgeous original hard wood floors.
Place is spotless and cozy.
The bed is old and losing comfort.
Parking situation is my only true complaint and the property cannot do anything about that. You can’t street park overnight so then your stuck in a parking lot you can’t see by a sketchy motel… did see quite a bit of sketch people at night. And a crotch rocket woke us up from a dead sleep in the middle of the night. Scared my whole family to death. If you want a quiet oasis.. this isn’t it. If you want a weekend down town and plan on going out and staying up this is for you.
The owners are amazing and responsive. The loft is cute and clean!!! Just know what your getting into."

Stayed over a week","The Downtown Loft East was a great location for us to stay at! It was close to our relatives house, restaurants, bars and shops! It was even right on the parade route for the 4th of July as well as the Downtown Friday Nights Event.
Although it did come with a set of knives, a knife sharpener would be a handy thing to have.
If there was something we needed for the loft, we called the number listed and help was minutes away.
Thanks for a wonderful Spearfish experience!"

Easy to enter off the street with 24 steps to your abode (get that workout in each day!).

The place is very cute, well maintained, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with olive oil, salt and pepper. Tracy is a great host with good communication and quickly resolved an issue with the lock system."

Not owners fault but there are lots of drunk college students leaving and walking from the bars. Location otherwise is excellent. If you have any back problems or just need a nice mattress for good rest then this spot might be an issue for you. Other than those things the place is beautiful and very well stocked!

Everything you need (restaurants, coffee, grocery, drinks) is literally a block or two away. The building is a restored historic landmark building and it perfectly balances old charm with new conveniences. It's very secure and very quiet for sleeping.
Only comment to make is that you do need to climb a floor of stairs to get to the apartment in case this is an issue for you. It was not for us but maybe would be for some older visitors."

While there is no designated space, parking for us was quite easy -- we arrived on a Friday afternoon, a spot was available in front of the apartment and due to our time of arrival, we didn't need to move the car after the two hour time limit. The bed was very comfortable and the shades do a great job of blocking out the light. You are in downtown Spearfish (adorable!), overlooking the main street and there is traffic noise. However, the thoughtfully provided fan provides the white noise needed to make sleeping easy. I appreciate the high quality linens for the extra mattress or couch -- my daughter was very comfortable. The photos represent the apartment very accurately. Rugs would go a long way in making the space cozier and there are only two (mismatched) wine glasses."

I would definitely recommend. The only advise I have is that it is on the second floor of the building so you do have to take stairs up to the apartment, so if you or anyone you are staying with has a disability, getting up the stairs might be challenging. But the stairs weren’t an issue. So clean and perfect! Highly recommend!!!!"

Stayed with kids","My family stayed at Tracy's charming loft for one night during our cross-country drive, and it was awesome! The loft is beautiful, stylish, and well considered, and the downtown Spearfish location is great— less than a block away from a wonderful natural food store (Good Earth), a yummy Italian restaurant (Nonna's Kitchen), and a fantastic breakfast/coffee/tea spot (Blackbird Espresso). Our daughter slept on the pull-out sofa, and I was happy to discover it had a much nicer mattress than the average sleeper. We also loved having a bathtub and a comfy king bed. All in all, it was a very enjoyable stay, and I cannot imagine a better spot in Spearfish (though I am sure her other loft is just as lovely). Thanks, Tracy! :)"

Stayed a few nights","ATTENTION: Only stay at this place if you want to be absolutely blown away by an incredibly charming and characteristic apartment overlooking the quaint Main Street Spearfish has to offer. In terms of location, this place is exactly where you want to be: walking distance to cafes, bars, parks, etc. This was a very secured apartment, exceptionally up-to-date & modern while at the same time, rustic with some unique character. The tall ceilings and huge windows gave this 2nd story apartment a great open, airy feeling (don't worry, the beautiful windows had black-out shades if you are wanting some seclusion). Everything was remarkably clean and it felt very comfortable. I honestly don't believe I could ever speak highly enough for this place. If you EVER have the chance to book this place in the Black Hills, DO IT! Thanks again Tracy!"

We booked super last minute and Tracy had everything ready to go within minutes of us booking and only a few hours before our arrival! There was a minor problem with the heat and Tracy was so quick to come and fix it and made sure we had other heat sources at our disposable. We spend quite a bit of time in the Black Hills each year and can honestly say that this is one of the nicest Airbnb options for the area and we would 100% stay again!

I wanted a quiet and comfortable room with private bath. The Rose Room was perfect as it is upstairs facing away from the back garden, so very quiet. It has a large private bathroom with a sink, toilet, tub and shower. Plenty of towels. Big comfy bed and a big couch. There is even a little gas fireplace! No ceiling fan but there is an A/C unit which kept things nice and cool. The host Sonya was awesome! There is no curfew. Bicycles are available (I chose to walk). After my first night I discovered I was the only guest in the house...it was nice walking around in my (provided) bathrobe! I enjoyed using the extremely well-stocked kitchen to make breakfast and dinner. Each room has designated space in the refrigerator. The hot tub was CLEAN and HOT!!

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at this off grid gem. What a unique location and property. I stayed here for two nights with my two kids. We were so comfortable and had plenty of room to enjoy some off grid time. We explored the walking trails and some of the local attractions. We can’t wait to come back!
The property -
Amazing unique construction with so many fun design ideas. You can tell a lot of efforts went into building this one bed cabin. We enjoyed the rocket ship treehouse, visiting the chickens, and exploring the property. Don’t worry about the toilet - it’s super simple and my 4yr old had no problems.
Location -
What a unique location. You feel like your out of town on a farm but your close enough to walk to restaurant or gas station.
Hosts -
The hosts are top notch, very timely responses to questions and always very helpful
We can’t wait to come back
Thank you!"

There is no door and the bathroom walls don’t go up to the ceiling. Also got quite warm inside as rules state AC is not to be run after 3pm"

Choosing an off the grid home that is completely independent and self-sustsinable, we had no idea what to really expect. Well, this home does not disappoint to give you a location to enjoy all of the Black Hills, and every luxury you are used to. The shower is amazing. It is huge with two shower heads, endless hot water, and makes you feel like you are liberated without a shower door. After long days exploring and hiking, we enjoyed taking a dip in the water hole, made bonfires under beautiful stars and even watched a movie.
If you are lucky, you will get to meet the talented and truly amazing, Cappie. Talking to him was one of our highlights. He is so attentive to make sure your stay is comfortable and you have all you need. Plus, he genuinely builds relationships with those around him.
We are amazed with the craftsmanship of the home and every detail put in! It was such a great trip. This place will not disappoint."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great place to stay! It was clean, well-kept, and on a beautiful piece of property that is fairly secluded (though not as much as some of the pictures may suggest). The hosts were very communicative and offered suggestions of events that were happening. The binder of info they provided about the cottage and the town was useful and informative. Overall it was a very pleasant visit!
There is one thing that was enough of a problem to warrant the 4 stars. If you are at all sensitive to noise, the fan on the compost toilet is loud enough that you hear it everywhere in the cabin (at least when I stayed in June 2022). You can even hear it while watching TV. It made it difficult to fall asleep because it is not pleasant. It was a relief when the fridge would kick on and drown out the noise in a more pleasant sound.
Another note is if you do go in the swimming hole, it is shared or right on the border with another property (which I believe they also rent out). That's fine by me but not well represented."

Stayed a few nights","One of the joys of travel is getting to stay in places that you would never otherwise have a chance to try living in, and this location is that to a tee. This place is an experience unlike any I have ever had, from the floor up (literally; even the adobe flooring was a new experience for me!). Not only is the location fun and interesting—Spearfish is the perfect combination of ""small enough to enjoy"" and ""large enough to have some conveniences""—but the building itself is a joy to stay in. It's design is rustic and interesting, but it does not sacrifice in comfort anywhere, from the spacious shower (with ample hot water) to the luxurious bed. If you're anywhere in the area, you owe it to yourself to spend a night or two here and just experience a different way of living."

It had everything we needed, the fireplace kept us nice and warm. Communication was great, very fast replies. The provided local coffee was great as well. Thank you!
It was also cool to learn a little bit about Cappie, and his involvement in the community. We found the Termesphere downtown, and gave the gears a spin. Then had to look it up and learn more about it."

Stayed one night","This place is AMAZING! My fiancée and I were passing through on a cross country drive and stumbled upon Cappie’s place as an option not too far from Deadwood. It’s even better in person than any pictures can do justice. From the start with Cappie personally showing us the grounds and familiarizing us with the straw bale house - to the comfy king size bed and full kitchen, this experience was outstanding. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s over the years and have never been in such a thought provoking and well thought out, intentionally designed space. We will be back - and next time to stay for several days OFF THE GRID! 10/10 recommend - you’ll be a better person after taking a grain of what Cappie shares with you! He knows sustainability and it shows."

Stayed one night","Cappie's place was truly unique and in an incredibly beautiful setting. The details of the house and structure are admirable--it was like a little oasis in Spearfish. We enjoyed hearing Cappie's story behind his work and the amazing property. We sat by the creek in the morning and had coffee, enjoying the peaceful setting, what a relaxing environment."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Cappie's place was a one-of-a-kind experience. We have been interested in strawbale for awhile, so we expected the clean, quiet functionality of the house. The pleasant surprise was the other projects on the property: the cob wood-fired sauna, the water wheel and plunge in the creek, chicken yard, swing, and hammocks. Fun for all! Rachel was very prompt, informative, and welcoming in her pre-visit communications, and Cappie spent a lot of time showing us around and enthusiastically answering our natural building questions. Thanks!"

We enjoyed the total serenity of this location, the hammock hanging slightly over the stream was amazing, the swinging bench by the stream and the entire land layout is wonderful. I would recommend this Air BnB home to anyone who needs a peaceful, scenic spot."

Relax by the creek, take a dip if you're hot, nap in a hammock, sweat in the spa, jump on the trampoline or get in the car and take a short drive to everything from Devils Tower to Mt. Rushmore. With scenic hikes and breathtaking byways all around don't miss out on the perfect combination of beauty and relaxation with this place!"

Cappie was easy to communicate with and gave us information about the house and the nearby area when we checked in. This house is truly unique and a real gem! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful one bedroom home that is fully furnished. It's more than a house that's off the grid it's a work of art. We didn't run out of electricity (we had a lot of devices iPads iPhones etc). Hot water was perfect. When you meet Cappy to check in ask him where the locals eat for excellent restaurants. It's located in the city but you don't feel like your in the city. It's safe. It's close to a lot of major tourist attractions. Spearfish itself is really nice and is very eclectic. We were told to check out spearfish canyon and I am so glad we did. There are all these elements close by and then return to the home to freshen up. Look out the picture window late at night deer always came to visit.
Cappy and his wife are the nicest couple. Once you check in and get the tour they leave so you have privacy they are not helicopter hosts. Its also very clean and organized. I'm really glad I had this experience it's worth it."

Enjoyed watching the turkeys come up from the draw in the evenings as well as the white tail and the late visiting mule deer.

Had a good snow come in but they helped with clearing the snow off the porch and made sure the road was clear to get out. Was given a coupon for a free pizza at their nearby restaurant and tood advantage of that to have dinner with friends. Instructions sent by email and inside the house were clear and easy to understand. Comfortable loveseat in the living area and they provided DirectTV and a firestick so was able to relax with good entertainment in the evenings. Lots of electrical outlets made finding a place to keep electronics charged easy."

Welcome page is provided with great local recommendations - definitely try the pizza place/brewery that the homeowners recommend (and own, I think), it’s delicious! I think my favorite part was waking up to the sound of a rooster crowing and also the pretty black horse in the field that always walked to the fence when you come out. Will definitely be recommending to friends :)"

The cabin was clean and spacious with a full kitchen and the modern washer/dryer was a huge plus. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a place to stay in Spearfish!

Stayed a few nights","We had an excellent stay. The beds are very comfortable, the shower has great water pressure, it was nice and cool for sleeping and has a great deck/view/chairs to sit outside and drink a glass of wine. It was nice to be able to take our dogs with. It was nice to have space to let our dogs run around a bit. They did harass the cows a bit but the cows didnt give them a second look, lol. We did check out the cabin owners brewery, Sawyer Brewery and it was outstanding. I am not a beer drinker but my partner had the beer and liked it. I had the root beer and it was great as well. We had pizza and cheese garlic bread…so good. Leftovers made for great breakfast. Would easily stay here again."

Stayed one night","Myself, my husband and two of his younger brothers (15&19) and our dog stayed here for 1 night on our way from Minnesota to Red Lodge. The cabin was perfect! Beds were comfy, we brought an air mattress so the boys didn't have to share and there was plenty of room in the main area. Couch is comfy, fire stick available for tv viewing, AC kept us nice and cool on a hot day, kitchen is well appointed, we made dinner at the cabin with no issues. Far enough off the highway to feel super private but only a 10 minute drive to the heart of Spearfish. We checked out the Spearfish Canyon Disc golf course and would recommend that for sure, as a non-disc golfer myself it was a really beautiful hike.
Overall we would recommend and stay again!"

The number pad to get in was hard to read until you touched it. Then it lit up. But it registered the number you touched, so you have to hit the right first number before it lights up. I had to take my sunglasses off to see the numbers.
There was house construction (remodeling) going on next door that started at 7:00 am. Fortunately, we were getting up early anyway.
Overall, a great place to stay in Spearfish."

Also had a beauty of a dish washer and refrigerator. I used them during our stay and had no problems with anything. Nice bathroom and shower too. Loved the shower head.
Chad was always available in case we had questions and the service we received was super. I would most definitely recommend staying in one of Chad’s Airbnb’s. We were close to downtown and the City Park is lovely. Nice walking path and could walk into the creek to cool off. If we plan another trip to Spearfish we will rent this bungalow again. Thanks for the great stay."

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay especially if you're wanting to be close to the BHSU campus. The newly remodeled unit was as described. I tend to do a lot of cooking when Im in Spearfish because our kiddo misses home cooked meals which is why we don't stay at hotels. I like to feel at home when staying in an ABnB so the small things matter. The kitchen was well stocked with most of what you'd need except there were no potholders to get food out of the oven and no salt and pepper. I will add though that this is one of the first places Ive stayed that actually had decent cutting knives so that was a PLUS. Also, if you plan to have more than 2 sleepers or like extra pillows bring them as there were only 2. Overall it was a great place to stay and an easy check-in process is always appreciated."

This Airbnb is right on one of main streets but just outside of central part of city in residential area. Entire unit is newly refurbished with high quality appliances and materials. Plenty of space for two people. There are two other units attached to same structure but never even heard others and entry is private. AC unit just really services bedroom so other rooms may get warm when it's really hot--we had no problems.
All in all, a very nice place, good location and at a very good price."

There was a trail behind the place that was perfect for walking them and it was beautiful. The amenities provided were definitely satisfactory, as the towels were the softest I have ever felt. One of the best parts was that there are two bathrooms, and both have showers. Very convenient for getting ready on the morning. While the immediate surrounding area is not the most pretty, it is walking distance to so many restaurants and so many other things. The bed was memory foam, which is not my favorite, but if you enjoy it then it is probably very nice!"

Jackie is a great example of what property owners should model themselves after. Her prompt and kind communication was so refreshing. She provided a notebook with all the info which was helpful. The mattress and furniture were extremely comfortable and the decor was beautiful and minimal. Thanks for sharing and for having such high standards. If ever in the area, I will certainly stay here again. Otherwise, I will tell others about your place. Thanks for giving us the best place to stay in SD"

Stayed one night","What a lovely stay, and this property is super cute!! Jackie gave us clear instructions and made it so easy to find and get in. Despite being basically a one-room cottage, the space was larger than a hotel room, sparkling clean, and beautifully decorated. Location was great too — just a half-mile walk to downtown Spearfish for an amazing dinner at Antuñez! Checkout was a bit early for us (10:00 am), so we headed over to Common Grounds for coffee and unique breakfast sandwiches — a great way to start the day!! The only tip I have for our wonderful host is to please not use fabric softener on the towels (not only does it make them less absorbent, but it's unhealthy for people with chemical and scent sensitivities). We will definitely be back next time we're spending a night or a weekend in Spearfish!!"

While it isn’t a large space, it didn’t feel crowded at all and the bathroom is actually pretty spacious. The couch is very comfortable, as well as the bed (supportive but not hard). There isn’t a kitchen table per se, but there is a little table and two chairs one could use if needed. We didn’t use the kitchen much but it seemed to be pretty well stocked with dishes, cookware and the like if you wanted to cook a meal. The area was quiet and peaceful. We didn’t use the hot tub but it looked cozy and clean. And there was a large grassy yard to walk our pup. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","Jackie was so responsive and friendly! We only stayed 1 night but it was a great stay for that night 🥰 Everything was clean and the hot tub was great 👍 There's a couple of eateries and a brewery right across the street (walking distance), which is amazing. My only wish is that it was communicated in the description that this tiny home is in what seems to be a little tiny home/mobile home community so it's not quite as private as we were expecting from the reviews. The neighbors were quiet but the deck with the hot tub is right next to the tiny home next door so you can hear others talking when you're trying to just rest and relax. While it was a nice stay for being close to town and a 20 minute drive from amazing hikes, we definitely felt the price was pretty steep for what it was. Aside from those couple of things, we were absolutely thrilled with our stay."

There is a private hot tub overlooking a pasture-like area, which we enjoyed greatly. Even though the home is technically in town, it feels secluded with the hot tub facing the greenery, and a privacy wall next to it. We enjoyed a good soak and watched the starry night sky. There's a neat guest book where people have left their notes on what's good to do in the area if you need suggestions. Would definitely stay again!"

We had never stayed in a ""tiny home"" before, so it was probably all to be expected, but the shower was unexpectedly small, to the point I avoided using it more than once. There was also no real seating, other than the bed or bar style dining chairs. Maybe host could consider only having the bed in the loft and a couch downstairs? But overall would recommend, the hot tub was great!"

We were in awe of the proximity of about 20 deer in the area, some of which will get very close to the home! They were so fun to watch from the hot tub on the back porch. The guest book inside is a great guide from past guests with activity and restaurant recommendations! We had never stayed in a tiny home before and had a total blast exploring the area and enjoying the space and hot tub. Jackie has thought of everything and has put so much care into this space. We messaged her once or twice with questions and she got right back to us! Also, the proximity to both I90 and local shops and restaurants is ideal. Do not hesitate to book this Airbnb!!"

Not too far of a drive from all the typical tourist sights in South Dakota, if you are okay with driving. The spearfish canyons were beautiful and I’m so glad we stayed here otherwise I may not have gotten to see them! Overall, this is an amazing place and we will definitely be back."

Stayed with a pet","Really appreciated having this place to stay in Spearfish. Recommend Spearfish Canyon and the Termesphere gallery. As far as the tiny home - great space but WiFi was not reliable enough to work from. Also had a few days with tons of flies - but luckily there are flyswatter’s under the sink.
It was great to wake up and watch the deer play in the yard next to the property, and always appreciate dog friendly spaces!"

At night, you can hear the tires from the semi's on the interstate, but it's quiet, not intrusive."

I'm an interior designer by trade and they did a wonderful job decorating. It was clean and well stocked with everything we needed. The only negative was that the light in the loft area didn't work and the cover wasn't on the socket. Other than that, it was lovely. At the end of our stay we decided a tiny home is not for us but it was a great experience."

Stayed a few nights","WOW! This place is perfect for a couples getaway! All of the comforts and cleanliness of a hotel suite but secluded and quiet in the woods. Also just a five minute drive to downtown shops and restaurants. Lang keeps a very new and clean property and there is even a yoga/meditation platform on the property and an archery range a half mile down the road. You are only 30 minutes from Spearfish Canyon and Black Hills Forest and 1.5 hours away from Badlands, Jewel Cave and Wind Cave. In our opinion, it was well worth a little extra drive time to have absolute quiet and calm in the evenings. Deer in the neighborhood too! A great value. We will be staying here on our next venture up to the Black Hills for sure. Thanks!"

We stayed during a snowstorm and had everything we needed to be shut in for a few days. The driveway and road are gravel and dirt but easily traversed by a regular car. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay by 4 days. Lang was very good to us checking on us regularly to see if we needed anything. Good breakfast items were provided for us and everything was very clean. Cleaning supplies and essentials (toiletpaper, shampoo, trash liners) were readily available."

Every amenity you can think of, and all artfully done. And the incredible exterior -- a fabulous wild game (including deer, eagles, coyotes and turkeys) area is right outside the door. A beautiful ridge (great hiking space) runs just behind the property and the Black Hills National Forest is a short ride up the road. Plus this perfect space (for up to 4 guests, including the bunk beds) is integrated into the geodesic-dome compound of the host's internationally- renowned artistic family. That's the excellent frosting on this really excellent cake. I can't recommend it highly enough! If you're visiting the Black Hills, stay here! You won't be sorry."

Stayed with kids","This location was great! New and clean! The front porch was great to relax and unwind. Super easy walk to Main St. for coffee or dinner. We had a great meal at Steerfish Smoke Steakhouse, I had the Indian Taco and everyone else had steak…great meal! Walk to Leone’s for ice cream for sure!!!
Spent the day chasing waterfalls in Spearfish Canyon, had lunch at the Latchstring on the back patio with great views of the canyon. If you’re in town in July don’t miss the BlackHills Roundup Rodeo in Belle Fourche!
Great AirBNB I would recommend to friends and/or come back if I’m lucky! Hosts were very responsive and friendly. The house has everything you need for a comfortable stay, why stay anywhere else???"

Our group unanimously agreed that Todd and Vickie’s was our favorite of the entire trip - with lots of thoughtful extras, cozy decor, and even cozier beds. I would highly recommend a stay here if you ever find yourself in Spearfish."

The home is spacious and was clean. The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were stocked, and the location was perfect for navigating Spearfish and the surrounding areas. A full kitchen made mealtime a breeze. Local downtown restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance if you prefer not to cook. Easy commuting to grocery, parks, and attractions. We enjoyed the close proximity to the Spearfish creek-side trail and even walking up to the college campus to get some exercise. Todd and Vickie are highly detailed, responsive and took time to answer some additional questions for me. They have a sweet little piece of Spearfish and I know you will enjoy staying here. Looking forward to returning!"

There are four separate bedrooms and two living areas. The place is quiet, and the beds are comfortable with nice sheets so we slept well. The kitchen is fully equipped for preparing meals. There is a k-cup type coffee maker with a nice variety of k-cups and they have several cups stocked. The bathrooms have plenty of soap, shampoo, towels, and a hair dryer. Two bathrooms have very nice walk in showers and one has a fantastic tub, suitable for soaking after a busy day.
The middle floor has a gas fireplace.

The kitchen was gorgeous and beautifully decorated. We appreciated the candles and nice soaps throughout the home. The neighborhood is so cute and the residents were so friendly to us and our children. We walked downtown from the house (about 4 blocks) and enjoyed the restaurants, breweries, and local shops. The highlight for the children was the creek, which is about 2 blocks away. They wanted to go down to the creek and play every day! It’s clear, cool, and perfect for something to do for an hour or so. The hosts of the home were easy to communicate with and the check out procedures were minimal, which was nice since we had a long day’s drive ahead of us when we left. We DEFINITELY would stay here again! Highly recommend!"

Kitchen had everything we needed for the cooking we planned. We took full advantage of the outdoor tables and chairs for our morning coffees.
