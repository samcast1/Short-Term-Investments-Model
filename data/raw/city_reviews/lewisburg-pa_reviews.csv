Stayed a few nights","This cottage is tucked away on a residential street in downtown Lewisburg, but less than 2 blocks from Market Street, which is the hub of activity for restaurants, pubs, shops, movie theatre, and the newly renovated Hufnagel Park. Lovely little cottage has everything you need to relax and/or work, and is a 10 minute (or less) walk to Bucknell University's campus. Plus, the host lives right next door, close if you need her but non-intrusive if you don't."

Stayed a few nights","This was a fabulous little cottage. I was in Lewisburg to do some work for the week at Bucknell University. The location was perfect - just a short walk to the lab, or to the shops, restaurants, and bars of downtown. Bina got me off on the right track with an informative orientation, some tips on Lewisburg's parking-ordinance quirks, and the practicalities (switches, thermostat, etc.) of the cottage. If I need to make another visit to BU, this cottage will be first choice for home-base."

Stayed with kids","I was visiting the area to tour Bucknell. Instead of staying in a hotel somewhere near a strip mall outside of town, I decided to book Bina’s cottage. Her cottage is a perfect example of why I often book with Airbnb. It was nestled in the center of Lewisburg, a charming little town. I got a sense of the town by saying right in a downtown neighborhood. The cottage itself was cute, comfortable, and very clean. Bina is also a very friendly, responsive host. We didn’t actually meet but through email I knew she was right there should I need anything. I didn’t need anything - it was a smooth, perfect Airbnb stay."

A great location, 12 minute walk to Bucknell. Right off Market Street, close to cinema, shops & restaurants. Everything we needed was in the cottage; kitchen was well stocked with everything you could need and everything worked. Lots of extras too; like coffee and filters; dish soap; quality laundry detergent and bathroom products…Nothing was lacking…Although we had brought much of our own, we didn't really need to! Great if you have a pet too as its set back from the street!"

We were in town to visit our daughter at Bucknell, where we find the university campus and town of Lewisburg so walkable that it seems a shame to stay at a hotel where we'd have to drive back and forth. The location of this place is ideal, as it's tucked along a row of lovely houses just off of the main business district. Everything inside was comfortable, clean and appealing. We made good use of the outside space as well on a beautiful fall weekend."

The atmosphere of the cottage is very cozy, quiet, serene, and comfortable. We stayed with our 9 month old and there was plenty of room for him to roll around and play. The back yard was a definite plus too! We appreciated the cottage amenities and quick responses to questions. We have family in the area and will definitely be booking here again in the future! 10/10 highly recommend!!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Bina and Justin’s cottage for a weekend getaway for hiking. But we wanted the comforts of a house and access to restaurants etc. Lewisburg and their cottage was perfect! About an hour away from multiple parks (we hiked at Ricketts Glen and Colonel Denning state parks) and in a small college town with good restaurants and coffee shops, etc, we felt at home immediately. It was great coming back to a clean and comfortable place to relax after a day hiking.
The cottage is charming and spotless clean! Bina was quick in responding to my questions about covid precautions. We felt very safe. The amenities were awesome. The little touches made it feel like coming home - leaving us local coffee and bathroom soaps. They have a communal backyard with chairs and a hammock that we spent some time with wine relaxing. Even though there are houses close by, it was very quiet and calm. And we were literally a block from the small downtown so we walked to restaurants and ice cream etc.
Bina, Justin, and little Aryeh (and their friendly cat) were so kind and welcoming while giving us privacy too. Bina was so responsive. I had absolutely no concerns about booking even during the pandemic. And Bina’s recommendations for places to eat did not disappoint!
Lewisburg is a charming community that emphasizes inclusion and respect which, as an interracial couple traveling in central PA (you never know), was much appreciated. When you visit, we recommend stopping by Amami for coffee and sweet treats, Grams for brunch, Siam for Thai and cocktails, and Brasserie Louis for dinner. All with outdoor dining!
All in all, we highly recommend staying at the Lewisburg cottage!"

Hot tub, fire pit, coffee, a few drinks, candy, many spices and such. All demonstrate Lamar & Amanda's desire to ensure an A+ stay.

The kitchen was clean and well stocked, especially the refrigerator with bottles of water, soda, sparkling water, and more. The yard was huge, and perfect for kids to run around. It is also far away from the main roads so you don’t have to worry about the kids playing. The last wonderful amenity was the hot tub which was very clean and relaxing.

The view of the peaceful farmland, especially from the spacious hot tub alone was worth it! The house itself is cozy and clean, and we loved sitting back and enjoying some Halloween movies in the most comfortable reclining chairs/couch. Beds were wonderful, especially if you like lots of room - the master has a king size mattress. Slept better than I do at home most nights! Downtown Lewisburg is adorable and picturesque - great food and coffee spots and an old movie theater playing old favorites! Great place for a family or some friends to stay and visit the surrounding area! Will likely be back :) Cheers!"

Little pieces of thoughtfulness were spread throughout the house from little candies in the kitchen to the extra toothbrushes that were provided in the bathrooms for use if needed.
Would definitely stay here again if traveling through PA."

Stayed with kids","Our stay was so wonderful. Beautiful property and home, very clean, lots of small extras like a stocked kitchen, drinks and snacks, seasonings, coffee and tea, extra tooth brushes and soaps in case you forget yours. Lots of comfy blankets and pillows. Very kid friendly, baby gate at the top and bottom of steps, 2 pack and plays, high chair, small kids sitting area and books. They reached out half way through our stay to see if we needed anything, so thoughtful. Big wide open sky to watch meteors from the hot tub. Absolutely perfect. It was great to run around the very large property, though we did bring bikes to ride the rail trail right next door but the road next to the house was so busy we didn't want to cross it on bikes with our kids so didn't bike as much as we thought we would."

Stayed a few nights","I normally don’t write reviews, BUT this place was amazing and Amanda and Lamar need to know that.
The pictures are accurate, however do NOT do this place justice.
The house sits on over 60 acres of beautiful land, with wide open views and no obstructions. You could literally look out and see for miles.
The house was beyond spotless. The floor plan is open, but extremely warm.
Anything needed was provided and then some. Soda, coffee pods, water bottles and a candy bowl in the kitchen to start. Plenty of cozy blankets, towels and throw pillows for cozying up in either the hot tub or fire pit.
I needed to talk myself into getting out of the hot tub because if I had my way I would have stayed in it forever- watched the sun set and rise from the hot tub and the sound of silence was amazing.
My husband and I needed to escape reality for a few days; this was exactly what we needed.
Thank you for going above and beyond- your place is amazing and we can’t wait to return

variety of kcups, teas, creamer, honey, disposable coffee cups, etc
foil, plastic wrap, propane for grill
toothbrushes, toothpaste, makeup wipes, flossers, qtips, body wash, shampoo, laundry essentials
ample towels and washcloths both bathrooms, extra towels for the hot tub area
high chairs, pack and play, toys for little ones, books, board games, cards, basketballs for the net outside, football, Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, etc
extra pillows and blankets - incredible blankets and throws to make you feel so cozy

Stayed with kids","Lamar and Amanda's homestead is beautiful, and was a wonderful spot for our families to get together. We had 5 adults and 5 young children staying with us.
When you walk in the front door the kitchen is on the left, the living room is in front of you, and the stairs to the second floor is on the left. There is a lot of open space between the living room and stairs that we utilized for toys for the kids. Upstairs are three bedrooms. The master bedroom has a bathroom connected to it with a shower, and the first bathroom has a bathtub. Outside has a seating area, a hot tub, a firepit area, a gazebo and loads of open space. They have a comfortable 3 season porch, too. We didn't end up using the hot tub or firepit but they look to be in great condition! They supply wood for the firepit. Anytime I reached out to Amanda/Lamar they were VERY quick to respond which was awesome.
The house was very clean when we got there and is decorated very cutely. There are a few kids toys/books available in a bin at the top of the stairs next to a kids chair. They have 2 pack and plays available and 2 highchairs. They also left out 2 baby gates so we could block off the stairs. Very kid friendly!
There were many house flies, but it's a farm - and that's totally normal. There's a fly swatter and the kids loved pointing them out to us. We didn't have any upstairs the whole time.
Overall we had an excellent weekend and will look to come back if the need arises again :)"

Stayed with kids","We had a lovely stay!! The house sits on a well kept farm with gorgeous views. Upon arriving we were immediately impressed by the property:
The house impeccably clean and cozy.
The fridge was stocked with water, pop, and seltzer water.
There was a basket of snacks and a great coffee set up.
The upstairs bedrooms and are beautiful and comfy.
Also, upstairs was a gated playroom for the little ones.
Any family with an infant would have appreciated the optional gates at the top and bottom steps.
Also, did I mention, how clean the floors were?! Again, families with infant/toddlers would appreciate the crawling surfaces being so clean!
There is a sunroom that faces the back property, hot tub, and fire pit. It is a great place to hang at night and a wonderful place for yoga in the morning. Amanda and Lamar messaged me the day of to check on our arrival and to make sure the hot tub would be clean and ready.
There is a sweet path to walk to the water tower. Our kids loved the walk and the view!!
One last thing, I have never been to a more clean Airbnb. Amanda and Lamar’s standards for clean and cozy has raised our standards for Airbnbs from now on. We really wished would could have stayed longer. Thank you!!"

Group trip","It was so nice to have a spot where all 11 of us could stay comfortably. Comfy beds, nice walking trail across the street and beautiful landscaping outside.
We werent accustomed to using heat pumps, so trying to get them to function on the 1st night was frustrating, but when Amanda gave us tips, they worked wonderfully after that. It would have been good to have those tips the 1st night- maybe as part of a welcome binder.
We were celebrating graduation- I wish there were a few nice serving dishes/platters/bowls. Let me be clear- we had what we needed from a utilitarian perspective, but older plastic bowls weren't that nice to use for a nice dinner. Fridge was missing shelf. Kitchen could be updated to match the rest of the house.
Sound was not an issue. If someone wanted go to bed early, sound didn't carry through the house. HUGE plus.
We would stay again, for sure."

The property itself is beautiful too! The surrounding yard is gorgeous and the house is only about 5 minutes from downtown Lewisburg.

Group trip","The owners were easy to work with and entry to home was easy. Allowed me to pay extra for a late checkout. The property was nice overall. It does need some cleaning on the outside - windows, etc. Some odd things in the house here and there. The basement needs an overhaul. It is a bit scary down there. Probably didn't help we all had children of the corn on our minds from the corn fields and coming in later at night in a thunderstorm did not help. The carport though was wonderful to keep us out of the rain for unloading. The vibe may have been different had it not just been me and 3 teenage girls. They did like the massage chair. Cell service on AT&T was not great. But the wifi worked great. There were already cold water bottles in the fridge and other drinks. Ice in ice cube trays to use. The beds were comfortable. And the queen with twin bedroom was perfect for the girls to stay together. The AC units kept the rooms nice and cold. Good water pressure."

We appreciated the little touches like soap and shampoo in each bathroom, the availability of supplies like garbage bags, paper towels, and an abundance of clean towels.
The home inside is beautiful and the beds comfortable. Don’t miss the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of this home and setting. You won’t be disappointed."

The house was enormous and had so many activities that we actually didnt go to one of the games! Between the fire pit, the large yard, ping pong, pool and the massage chair, we had plenty to do during downtime. The kitchen had everything we needed, as did the griling area. We would definitely stay there again!"

Group trip","5 Cousins and their families gathered from five times zones and three continents to say goodbye to a beloved father, grandfather, and Uncle. We found colonial Pines online and it looked like it would meet the needs of our family for the sad weekend.
From the very first contact, Lamar and Amanda were incredibly responsive to our questions and concerns. They made sure we had enough plates and cutlery for a group of our size and the welcome snacks and drinks in the fridge we’re happy surprise. Throughout the weekend they answered questions and brought additional supplies like firewood for the fire pit as needed.
The house is beautiful, the grounds are well-kept, photos are accurate and everything was immaculate when we arrived. I got a lot of credit from the family for finding the perfect place, but Lamar and Amanda made it a huge success. We created new family memories and spent hours around the fire pit at night talking about my uncle. We could not have asked for a better experience and highly recommend this house. Thank you so much!"

Tons of land for the little kids to run around and they couldn’t get into trouble because you could see them (and the entire property) for miles! Lots of places to sit inside and outside! HUGE living, relaxing and entertaining spaces. The house was tastefully decorated with a large entertaining and dining room, multiple family and living rooms, bedrooms for all our kids and for the entire family to get together! High class decor, comfortable beds, extremely clean house! Enormous master bathroom and even a deck off the master bedroom! Little kid chairs, high chair, crib, and pack n play! EVERYTHING PROVIDED and with a family with young kids that means a lot of extras! You could tell they thought of everything! Fire pit stocked with wood was a hit! EVERYONE was HAPPY! My oldest wanted to live here permanently! Would DEFINITELY RETURN! The hosts and owners were KIND, RESPONSIVE, and easily ACCOMMODATING ! They even offered to send us items we left behind! We LOVED it! Ended up staying 4 additional nights we loved it so much! Thanks a million!"

Stayed a few nights","This unique rental in the heart of downtown Lewisburg was ideal for our family celebration of our son's Senior Day for Bucknell Football. Walkable to downtown and campus, the location is ideal! The high ceilings, updated kitchen, and beautiful outdoor courtyard were amazing. The upstairs bedroom configuration is a little weird for couples (two rooms share a Jack & Jill bathroom without locking doors (and an additional swinging door with no lock between 2 of the bedrooms), but we made it work - we only slept up there, as we were too busy enjoying the rest of the house and surrounding area. Overall, we LOVED this unique villa, would definitely stay here again, and will be recommending it for other football player families. Thank you!"

I didn't meet my hosts, but they were very welcoming and friendly. My kids joined me for part of the stay and Kerry had an air mattress ready in case it was needed. The home was pristine, yet homey, with a clean black and white color scheme--with fun touches like the red stair risers and chalkboard paint in the half bath. I don't know how they got the kingsize bed up those narrow stairs, but I'm grateful--wow, what a comfortable bed! Finally, I appreciated the patio with a table and chairs for drinking coffee or just hanging out in the pleasant yard."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time we've stayed at Kerry and Jeremy's well-appointed space! This trip we were able to enjoy more of the living-area and kitchen, making lazy brunches and eating outside on the quiet patio. The kitchen has everything you need if you choose to prepare meals. The bed is ridiculously comfortable, and, much like the kitchen, the bathrooms and bedrooms are well stocked with towels, sheets, and paper products. Bonus points for the chalk wall in the first floor half bath.
Perfect location if you need to do anything at Bucknell. Easy walking distance to campus and all the downtown shops, restaurants, bars. This trip we used the house as our home base going back and forth from Penn State. We're in Lewisburg fairly regularly, but a new stop was Union Cellars - nice wines and beautiful space/outdoor patio overlooking rolling hills.
We also appreciated the kind welcome gift of local wine and our favorite local Purity candy. 10/10! Looking forward to our next stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay and would come back if we were in the area. Our hosts answered all our questions and were able to accommodate an early arrival. The house was clean, and the beds were comfortable. We felt taken care of with all the amenities one would have in their own home. The outdoors was beautiful this time of year with flowers surrounding the perimeter of the property. The Keurig machine (supplied with pods) was a great added touch. Thanks for the great experience."

Stayed a few nights",I had a wonderful stay at Kerry and Jeremy’s place! I’m a local and used my stay for a short getaway and time of work. The location provided me lots of opportunities to take breaks by going for walks to enjoy the beautiful town of Lewisburg. The house was well-stocked with odds and ends that I needed (plastic wrap! Hairdryer! Wine opener!) and was simply and beautifully decorated in such a way to make me feel right at home. So thankful for this little gem of a place and hope to return again next year!

We love having the off street parking. The house looks just like the pictures and has everything you’ll need. I get tired of staying at Airbnbs that leave you needing coffee, detergent, toilet paper, etc. You will not have that issue here! Kerry and Jeremy reached out to check on us, but we needed nothing. I’m sure if we did, they would be quick to respond. The house is clean and adorable. We loved staying here again and we hope to be back again next year!"

I was ready to call it quits on Airbnb as I was so tired of sagging mattresses, cheap silverware, poorly stocked kitchens, etc. Kerry and Jeremy seem to have gone out of their way to make their home so welcoming to guests. They had a bottle of local wine and a box of local chocolates on the island at arrival. Everything was well stocked; beds were comfortable; and the house was immaculate and perfectly decorated. Arrival and checkout were the easiest we’ve ever had. Kerry checked in before and after arrival with us. We never needed anything, but if we did, I’m sure we would have had it addressed immediately. The house is only blocks away from town and the university. We loved strolling the streets, shopping, and even just sitting out in the quiet backyard. We definitely hope to be back. This is the perfect spot for visiting Lewisburg. We absolutely loved it."

Stayed one night","Charming place, looks just like the pictures. Super clean, well-appointed, and comfortable. Nicely located above the garage, with privacy, a relaxing view of the surrounding fields, and a sweet little deck and chairs by the door. We didn't get a chance to use the firepit area, but it looked nice. The whole place is well designed. We were in the area for only one night to visit Bucknell, but I'd happily stay again."

It is immaculate, bright and tranquil and just a short drive to the heart of Lewisburg, where our favorite café
Amami is located. They are excellent hosts and were incredibly responsive. So much better than staying in a basic hotel! We look forward to staying in this gem the next time our travels take us to Lewisburg!"

Stayed a few nights","Its a cute cozy little loft. The bed was wobbly & the matress was hard & uncomfortable. The TV is very small and difficult to see from the bed. The room also smelled a little musty, maybe because it's over top a garage. Not sure. It did look very nice and the shower was very nice. But because of those things I mentioned regarding the bed and the musty smell, I would rate it a 4. Easy improvements would make this a 5 star airbnb."

Stayed one night","We had been traveling for several days, in and out of various hotels/guest rooms. When we stepped into Brandon and Mariah’s place, it immediately felt homey and welcoming. There were fresh flowers on the table! It was very clean (and I have high standards), the bed was comfortable, the shower was great, the bathroom is large enough for 2 people to share. There are many thoughtful touches throughout. It was great to have laundry facilities available to do a quick load of laundry. I recommend this as a quiet, comfortable place to stay; large pretty yard. We were just overnight so I can’t address the options for “things to do in the area” but there is a list, as well as a list of recommended eating places."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Brandon and Mariah's place two nights, in town for the UnPAved gravel bicycle ride. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The space was very clean and welcoming and we liked the decor, but it was smaller than expected. It's basically one room with a kitchenette, table, sofa, and bed, plus a bathroom. We didn't mind the nightly price (or the size), but the $150 cleaning fee seems high for such a space. And, there were a few things that we found awkward - like limited options to store clothes. That said, there were many touches that we liked: fresh flowers, makeup washcloths, Q-tips, honey for our tea, hot water that came fast, a nice ""welcome"" book, and even a ""bathroom trivia"" book on a shelf next to the toilet. The place was quiet and peaceful and we could see lots of stars and night. We also liked how close it is to downtown, where we spent most of our days when not on a bicycle. We didn't get to meet the hosts, but communication with them via Airbnb was friendly"

Stayed a few nights","Nicholas's place was a win from beginning to end. Communication and responsiveness was fantastic and I felt like we got a great deal, price-wise, given the location. I will never forget walking out the front door, going up the street ten steps, and finding myself in a beautiful French bakery. We went both mornings! And on Saturday night, we walked 20-30 steps to Hungry Run Distillery where we bought to-go cocktails and brought them back to enjoy while watching the 82"" TV. Downtown Lewisburg is our kind of town (we got salads to go from Bull Run Tap House, bought some gifts at the mercantile shop, made a couple of trips to the book store, etc etc) and staying at Nichola's is the best way to experience it! I enjoyed talking to Nicholas, but if I was a more private person I never would have met him; he is the kind of host that makes sure you are comfortable without infringing on your space."

It’s less than a 5 minute walk to downtown and 10 minute walk to campus. Ideal for a quick visit. There is a small yard to entertain that would be good for hosting a small BBQ for several students if the owners allow it.

There is a great playground right down the street that our kids enjoyed. One thing to note for parents of small children: there is a very steep indoor staircase that goes down at a narrow point in the hallway that isn't shown in the pictures. Otherwise this place met our needs and we enjoyed our stay!

Everything you could need was there and the host was so friendly and even offered to help me with my bags.
Everything inside was recently renovated - and it was clean. The linens smelled really good, like laundry detergent, which is rare in Airbnbs (may be based on allergies but still).
There's plenty of food options locally and even a washer and dryer inside. It was only me, but the space felt pretty large for an apt from an owners home. The entrance is seperate and you get the great option of 2 door options."

Bookends of the living room and kitchen. Bedrooms and bathroom in the middle (but separate rooms). Nicely decorated. Comfortable beds. Quite.
3. Clean. Overall it felt and looked clean and organized."

Stayed with kids",A true hidden gem accommodation in Lewisburg! We were in town for a swim meet at Bucknell and couldn't find a decent hotel/motel reservation for the June weekend. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this listing on AirBnB! It was so spacious and clean - recently renovated with lots of love poured into the project. We all slept like logs - the beds are firm but quite confortable. Parking was easy and the city is so walkable. Ryan was kind enough to provide us some recommendations for breakfast (highly recommend Grams - they have an online waitlist!) and things to do during our downtime (if you like craft and flea markets head to the Street of Shops). Everything in the apartment feels modern and airy. We hope to return for future events and will always look to book with Ryan. It truly feels like a home away from home!

We loved the apartment and its location to the quaint town of Lewisburg and Bucknell.
The kitchen had everything you needed, the beds were super comfortable, and the living room while super cute-I would have liked a more comfortable chair or a smaller sofa.
The small porch outside was an added plus and I enjoyed some quiet time there after a long drive to Lewisburg.
The decor was fun and the added touch of each room having a before picture was super cool. Ryan put a lot of work into each room and it paid off. Lastly, I love the positive signs throughout the apartment-just made us feel happy during our stay.
I would highly recommend Ryan’s place and would rent again in a heartbeat. Thanks again Ryan!"

He was able to stay with me and get a break from campus, but still walk to class in the morning in just about the same amount of time as it would have taken him from his dorm. But even more than that, Donna's place feels like home. It's pristine, organized, and thoughtfully laid out. Donna is communicative and helpful. I would say this home is our favorite rental in Lewisburg, but it's more than that - it's one of our favorite rentals ANYWHERE. From start to finish - a perfect home, and a perfect host."

The beds were very comfortable and we got some of the best sleep we've gotten in a while. The kitchen as well as the rest of the house was stocked with everything we needed and spacious enough for all of us to work in. Even with six adults in the house there was plenty of room and didn't feel crammed. The neighborhood is very quiet at night and parking was not an issue at all. If you're staying in Lewisburg I highly recommend Donna's place. We're looking forward to visit again soon.

Our stay there was absolute perfection in every way possible. The location is ideal for Bucknell parents- literally across the street from campus in a quiet residential area with unobstructed river views. The interior decor and design is gorgeous- the pictures do not do it justice. It was impeccably clean, with thoughtful details throughout to make the stay extra comfortable. We truly felt at home there- in fact, we felt it was move in ready! Check in and check out were easy, the linens were soft and comfortable, and everything was brand new. This was the best visit to Lewisburg we have ever had, thanks to this gem of a house."

Stayed a few nights","Having a life-long personal attachment to Bucknell University, I also love Lewisburg. So, being at Market & Third St. was dear fun for me, especially today with the great eateries that have evolved along & just off Market (e.g., Siam), & venerable Casa de Pizza still going strong after 50 years (I first visited it in its Year 2!), the Bull Run Tap House, &, right across the street, old Lewisburg Hotel, All-Star Bagels, a great eatery called Grams. The unit itself is spacious and uncluttered, both of those features important for me, and has a front- & corner window view of its Market-St intersection. For me, it was a hot, long weekend in late summer, however. So offer of only tiny pin-hooks on which conveniently to dry towels & wash cloths daily combined poorly w/ limited air-conditioning (2 window units: main central room & 1 of 2 bedrooms) plus 1 ceiling fan. Visitors would also do well to pack their own 3-to-2-prong electric outlet adaptors, and perhaps also own extension cords."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was really nice. Well stocked with all the necessities. The beds were extremely comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean. Very spacious. Parking was easy. Location can’t be beat. There are many bars, restaurants and cafes nearby and the Bucknell campus is a pleasant walk away. And even with the great location downtown it was nice and quiet. Check-in was a breeze. Will stay here again for sure."

Stayed a few nights","This apartment is a flight up stairs and easy to get into with the keypad by the door of the bnb. It is right on Market (main) St in Lewisburg so very convenient. The beds were comfortable as was the living room. The place is very clean and has what one might need for a few days in town. As it is close between other buildings it was a bit darker than we expected, but still quite cozy. 1 1/2 baths was very nice to have. All in all a good spot!"

Stayed a few nights","Very, very nice in many ways! Place is huge with two nice sized bedrooms. Entire second floor of building. Kitchen/linens/towels well appointed. One full bathroom with a large tiled shower plus another half bath. A place that four people can share without tripping over one another. Very relaxing.
Even better is the location. On Market Street in downtown Lewisburg. Great historic vibe all around you. Very walkable and an interesting town. Nice to see that Market Street seems to have survived Covid rather well. Campus Theater just reopened. Beautiful single screen art deco gem. Walk to Bucknell University. Gorgeous campus. Had dinner and drinks at Brasserie Louis. Delicious. Night cap at The Lewisburg Hotel. Breakfast take out from All Star Bagel. Try em all!
Thanks Sharon and Tedd. We will be back!"

Our daughter is graduating from Bucknell, and we are unlikely to travel the 9-10 hours to Lewisburg again. So I guess we can share this place with you! Give it a try - you will be so happy you did!"

It's in a prime location along the Main Street in Lewisburg, PA - so many restaurants and shops within walking distance and only a few blocks from the Street of Shops. Parking was super simple and the contact-less check-in process was quick and easy. The space itself was very nice - a lot of space and so nice to have 1.5 baths + washer/dryer! Would certainly stay here again on my next visit to the area!"

The apartment is spacious / plenty of room to hang out in the kitchen or in the living room - and the beds were comfortable! I wish they had a bigger, comfier sectional couch (the room is plenty big) but it worked. Communication with Sharon was great! It was exactly what we needed after a day at the local wineries. Walked to Elizabeth's for dinner - and that was awesome! Lewisburg really has a nice downtown area!"

Stayed one night","Lovely apt in a great location. Walkable or a short drive to lots. Very comfy beds. The apt in general is very dark. No fault of the hosts, it is a row house right next to another building so doesn't allow for a lot of natural light but it was rather gloomy in the kitchen and bedrooms. The internet was terribly slow. Didn't matter for our visit but if someone needed to work from the apt, it would be a challenge. Overall, it was a very nice stay in a fantastic location. Would rent here again if our son decides to go to Bucknell!"
