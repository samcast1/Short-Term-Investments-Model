Stayed a few nights","My daughter got married at Picks and this was the perfect house for my family for the weekend to relax and get ready for her big day. It was right around the corner so it was extremely convenient to go back and forth to decorate and set up. The house was exceptional and the extra amenities she had were terrific. The house was spotless, the beds comfortable, and the view was spectacular We used the boat dock for our pontoon and it was so convenient. She was flexible on our arrival time and we appreciated her working with us. We would definitely stay here again!!"

Stayed with kids","My family and I had THE BEST weekend at Portage Lakes Paradise! It was our first time staying in this area and we are so grateful we found this home to rent. Plenty of space for our family of four and even a crashing Auntie who came by to enjoy, too!
The kitchen has everything you need and we loved the grill and fire pit. We were able to easily rent a boat at a local marina and dock it at the house.
Loved waking up to coffee on the back porch overlooking the water. Truly felt like a five star vacation. Will rent again and recommend to friends."

Stayed with kids","I can't say enough wonderful things about Amanda's place on Portage Lake. The home was perfect for our family and had ample space to spread out and enjoy the lake and beautiful surroundings. Amanda and Dante were incredibly generous hosts and proactively helped my family navigate some of the questions we may have before arriving - like detailed instructions to make check in seamless and information about the home. This home was a wonderful oasis and ""home base"" while returning back to Ohio to be with family. Very easy to get to CLE, downtown Akron and multiple major areas for shopping, restaurants and entertainment. We wished we would have been able to stay longer and rent a pontoon on the lake. The local ice cream shop around the corner is a MUST TRY! A huge THANK YOU to Amanda and Dante! Cheers!"

Group trip","From check in to check out everything was perfect! The house was beautiful, with “tiny home” vibes but with 3 floors of space. The cutest kitchen and bathrooms ever, plenty of sleeping areas and a really cute and cozy bar area that leads you outside to the the grill area and outdoor couches. AND THE VIEW! You are right on the water and from the backyard space to the upper deck to the living room were water views that I am still obsessing over. Host/hostess were extremely nice and accommodating. Very communicative and just all around wonderful. As long as you as a renter are considerate and mindful of neighbors and ok with stairs this will be the most relaxing stay ever. Will definitely be planning another stay here."

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect for my needs. I actually had an issue at a different airbnb before switching to this one for a business trip and hooooo boi I liked this place soooooo much better. Neighborhood was nice and quiet, nest thermostat for ease of controlling the heat/air. This means in the warmer months you won't just have to rely on a window unit! Comfy beds, stocked kitchen with snacks and utensils, smart tv in the living room downstairs. There's also a pretty eclectic mix of books to read if you're a bibliophile. It just felt cozy and relaxing, maybe it's the carpet floor? If I'm ever back in Akron I'm coming right here."

The house has a lot of strong scents that were all pleasant to me (febreeze, heavily perfumed laundry soap for the towels), but very strong so wanted to share in case you might have sensory needs around scents. Well equipped kitchen and nearby a lot of nice places to check out. Definitely will stay here when we come back to Akron."

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer’s place was beautiful! VERY clean, and we had everything we needed for 2 nights. Parking was easy, felt safe in the neighborhood, and she communicated right away!! Wasn’t on a busy street and everything you would need is very close by. My mom and I traveled 2 hours for a concert in Ohio that ended up being canceled the day of.. but luckily the Airbnb was only a few minutes away from local restaurants and other things to do so we took up one of Jennifer’s suggestions and loved it!! Would definitely stay again!!"

Stayed over a week","My husband and I just had a wonderful month stay in this property. It fit our needs very well and we felt right at home is the cozy and well maintained home.
The neighborhood is good, most neighbors take good care of their yards/exterior, some around the house not as much but were friendly and quiet.
The house has an AC unit upstairs and downstairs which was great for the summer heat. If you will be using both bedrooms during summer months it is worth noting that only one room has an AC unit. If you leave all the doors open it should still cool off the upstairs enough to work ok. We only used one bedroom so it was not an issue for us at all.
I would certainly recommend this property and Jennifer was great to work with."

There’s a plaza with a grocery store/chinese restaurant/dollar store nearby which is great for any stays longer than a week, and while we didn’t have a chance to try most of them out Jennifer left some great recommendations for where to go. There are 2 things about this place to note: the bathroom door doesn’t fully close and the neighbors have really friendly dogs. Neither of these are an issue that should dissuade you from renting this place, but if you have a severe dog allergy/fear that’s something to note"

Stayed with kids","I Loved this home! Jennifer was an amazing Host! Very quick response time & overall no issues & we had a great stay. Home was perfect for our 3 person stay. The home is newly renovated & i absolutely loved the new carpet! Upon entering is the sun room & it was a bit chilly but its closed off from the home by another front door so it does not affect the living room area. Keyless entry was a plus. Super warm, heat controlled by wifi thermostat. Small tv but wasnt a deal breaker. Kitchen is cute & love the gas stove! Basement was available to use washer & dryer & grab extra supplies. Plenty of snacks offered by the host. The upstairs is where the bedrooms & bathroom are located. Bedrooms both were spacious & extra blankets were available. I definitely recommend this place & would definitely stay again."

We enjoyed every space: a kitchen with pots and pans for cooking, a large dining table for our family meals, a backyard patio with an expansive yard to run with the puppy, a large TV with family seating for a movie night. We barely had time to work in a game of pool. The most amazing part of the home was having five private bedrooms with four having individual accessible baths. The home was very clean, too. Our hosts were amazing in providing details about the Akron area as well as explaining how to use some of the house features. The Fairlawn home ranks on our list as one of the best places to stay while visiting family in Akron. We hope to visit again."

The accommodations were very lovely, there was a little bit of food stocked in the house when we arrived, and we even had a friendly 1920’s Goodyear Factory Worker ghost residing in the home! He only made small noises to scare us but overall he was a delight to have within the home. Overall, Jennifer is a wonderful host and I highly recommend staying here if you’re visiting Goodyear Heights or would enjoy a ghost roommate."

Stayed with a pet","Pros:
Easy to check in
Responsive host
Warm house
Quiet street
Easy parking
Laundry
Pet friendly
Extra space heater
Cons:
VERY firm bed
Pillows were flat
No ice melt for icy stairs
Squeaky floors and squeaky bathroom
pocket door. I don’t recommend staying here with two couples, unless you want to be woken up if people get up during the night to use the restroom
Hair in the tub
Dirt on the bathroom floor and in corners
Hair in the bathroom sink/ sticky rings on the bathroom vanity that wasn’t cleaned
Black specks in sugar container
Extra blankets were downstairs in the laundry-not easily accessible in the closet like stated (stairs are very narrow and steep)
Left an item there and would have been an outrageous amount to ship it. Had to disturb my SIL to drive to get it for me."

There were nice added touches, nice bath towels, extra toiletries, snacks in the kitchen, etc. Being from the area myself, I will say that the location itself is decent, it's not ""scary"" in any way but also not in an excellent neighborhood. But there were no incidents to speak of, our kids played outside in the snow with a neighbor, chatted with another neighbor, and overall we felt safe. Jennifer is kind and concerned for her guests, and very good with communication."

Stayed with a pet","We booked this house as we were traveling with two dogs and had a fenced in yard. The house is nearly 100 years old, so expect some creaks and old nuances, but that is part of the charm. The home was quite clean for being as old as it was and nicely decorated. Check in was very easy and Jennifer was in constant communication which made our experience a breeze. The bedrooms were roomy enough with good closet space. Beds were a firm memory foam with a variety of pillows and extra blankets.
The living room and dining room was perfect size for just the two of us. The kitchen was well stocked and we didn't need a thing which was nice. We even baked cookies!
The bathroom was small, but we made it work. It was well stocked and clean with plenty of towels.
The water was always hot, the heat worked perfectly. We really didn't want for anything while we were there.
The yard is a decent size for a dog to run, but beware some gaps/holes in the fence so your dog doesn't slip through.
The neighborhood is quite old, but quiet and close to shopping and food. We had a nice time and plan to say here again next time we're in town!"

Stayed with a pet","We stayed here for a few days with the goal of seeing one more National Park on our list. We loved seeing the Cuyahoga Valley and might return again in the summer or fall when more of the attractions are open.
This rental reminded me of my grandma’s house in a good way! The decor was up-to-date with a calming beach vibe, but the cabinets, countertops, and plaster work are reminiscent of an older time. There were thoughtful touches too, like having USB chargers at the bedside and living area so we didn’t have to hunt for a plug. We loved that we were able to bring our dog along, and the rental was a good value. I wished for just a few more kitchen necessities like a pie pan (for a pot pie) or sauce pan (to reheat a small batch of soup), but we were able to make the meals I brought along to prepare by improvising with the existing kitchen items.
This was my first Air B&B, as we’ve usually used VRBO. With VRBO, it is rare that there is fish soap, hand soap, laundry soap, paper towels, or more than one roll of toilet paper for the duration of the stay, but this home was stocked with all of these items in ample supply. The host also left a basket of treats like tea, microwave popcorn, and granola bars which was also very much appreciated.
Five stars, would definitely consider staying here again if we visit the area in the future."

The fenced yard was perfect for my dog and for relaxing after a long day. The large screened-in front porch was a great bonus!

The backyard was fenced with a 4 foot chain link fence. The mitchen had all the appliances we needed to make breakfast and dinner, and even came with a few snacks! Had it been a bit warmer, the front porch was enclosed and would have been a nice place to sit and have breakfast in the morning. The only problem we had was that being an old house, the floors squeaked, with every step, and this really freaked out my scardy cat dog, who refused to move around the house because of it and just wanted to stay in the living room. Besides for the dogs neurosis though, it was a wonderful stay, and I would recommend this place to anyone who doesnt have a skittish dog in tow."

Great location to area attractions. Jennifer was an amazing host! Her communication was incredible. From answering any questions literally within a minute or two, to just checking in with us through the week. Before we came, I asked her about a coffee maker as we are big coffee drinkers. She surprised us day 1 with a brand new coffee maker for the home. I only bring this up as it shows that Jennifer went/goes above and beyond for her guests. We are frequent travelers to the Akron area, and this was our first time getting an Airbnb in Akron, but I can say without a doubt, we will be rebooking this hone or one of her other homes for all future trips."

House is old and creepy as expected being built in the 20s and they have made the interior really friendly. The only things that weren’t up to par, was the shower didn’t drain quickly, so water builds up in the tub. And one of the door handles to the bedroom is loose and falls off if you pull it the wrong way. Of course these are minor things so overall the stay was worth the trip."

Stayed a few nights","Title: A Stellar Stay in Akron's Northside District
Our recent stay at an Airbnb in the Northside District of Akron was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Airbnb experience we've ever had. From the moment we stepped in, it was clear that this place was something special. The apartment was not just well-appointed, but it exuded a level of bougieness that we hadn't encountered in any of our previous stays. Every single thing we could have possibly wanted or needed away from home was provided.
The hosts deserve a special mention for their exceptional hospitality. They were gracious, kind, and always available when needed without being intrusive. It's rare to find hosts who strike the perfect balance between attentiveness and giving guests their space, but they nailed it.
One of the highlights for us was the secured parking, which gave us peace of mind throughout our stay. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a good night's sleep after days spent exploring the city."

The space is exquisitely decorated with the impeccable tashe of our host quite apparent. The whole living area is pristine and all the appliances high end and brand new. I helped myself to a double Expresso from the Expresso machine and later on had coffee from the regular Keurig machine. Fresh delicious coffee beans were provided by our fantastic hosts. There were snacks on the counter which was a thoughtful touch. The bathrooms were super cozy, with plush bathrobes provided. My wife was super pleased with the Sonos speakers. Connecting to the system was seamless. Both TVs had Roku connectivity. I was able to watch the soccer games with zero issues. This is the best Air bnb we have ever stayed at. Luxury personified."

Two beautiful bedrooms with bathrooms and showers. The master had a walk-in closet. The beds were beyond comfortable. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking anything – included all types of dishes and cutlery. I loved the espresso & Keurig machines – including coffee pods and flavors (and tea). The cabinet was full of snacks. Smart speakers throughout the condo smart TVs in all the rooms. The fireplace also added a cozy elegant feel to the space. And the hosts, Ifjen and Efe, were extremely friendly & responsive. They were also very flexible with our check-out time. I can't recommend this place enough. I’ll definitely book it again next time I'm in town."

Stayed a few nights","Vivonne was a wonderful host and everything was extremely well organized with directions with check in and checkout. Her description was very accurate. I had to come in for a funeral from out of state solo and really didn’t know much about the area. It was less than a mile from all the locations I needed to be at. With such a sad event to attend, I found her spot very comfortable, homey and happy. It felt like sunshine in her rental and gave me really positive , happy and peaceful vibes. I enjoyed sitting on the front porch a lot reading and having a glass of wine in the evenings. It felt very safe. She had excellent doors and locks when I would shut down especially because I was solo - this made me feel more confident and at home .
I must say - that shower had the best water pressure I’ve ever experienced . 😀
Best as she described for a couple or small group or for a solo guest . Thank you Vivonne!
I will definitely rent from you again if I come back into town."

Across the street from the residence is a cute shop filled with products created by Ohio artisans - be sure to check it out before you leave.
The photos and description is as shown and described on the site. I was really amazed how quiet it was in the home even though it was in an area with a fair amount of traffic. All the amenities, especially the shower, were really nice. If you are a yogi, there is a perfect spot to get a great workout. :-)"

I felt like she thought thru every detail. From the art to the the books on the shelves to the to picking nicer linens to having a yoga mat there for us. The location is great. In highland square and it was easy to walk or drive everywhere we needed to go! Truly loved the space and appreciated the host. Will be back again the next time we are in Akron!!"

Vivionne’s place was in the perfect spot for us to stay. She was very communicative about how to check in and out. The house has such a great vibe and charm to it. You can see the history in the architecture of the home. The house was immaculately clean and decorated so well. The bed was very comfortable and our friend slept on the pull out couch which he said was nice. I loved the little touches she added-the vinyl player, akronopoly, the LED lights under tv & bathroom sink. The cozy loft room and spacious kitchen made us feel right at home. We spent our evening and morning on the outdoor patio and people watched, ate pizza from Lee Angelo’s directly across the street, & even the apiary neighbors brought us free honey which was so nice! We really enjoyed our time at this space and in Akron. Thank you!"

We really loved the soulful, retro feel of her place, from the furniture to the lighting and decorations (especially the record player and LPs in the spacious living room!). The location was easy to find, right off a main road, yet was quiet enough for us to get a good night's sleep. We enjoyed our stay there and would come back if we get the chance."

The doors are heavy and when locked feel very secure. My younger sister and I felt safe during our stay. I loved how our hosts provided a guidebook full of recommendations in the area. I am very glad we decided to stay here! I would recommend!"

Everything was clean and the vibe was fantastic. Communication was great. The place was a unique and relaxing space to come back to after a long day of hiking. Close to the park as well. The virtual guide was very helpful and I suggest using it to find fun spots and delicious eats around Akron. Highly recommend! Certainly a gem."

It was in close proximity to many location shops and the main roads to get from one location to the next.

The space smelled lovely upon arrival, there were tons of amenities, and the space has a ton of beautiful, Instagrammable spaces. The bed has has a soft mattress pad, which was softer than I prefer (I love a firm mattress), but I slept like a baby! There are blackout curtains, outlets right next to the bed to make charging your mobile devices easier, plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner, and soap in the shower, and extra toiletries in the medicine cabinet. The guidebook was also very helpful and full of great information. Thanks for a great stay! I couldn't recommend a better place."

Stayed a few nights","This loft is in a great location to enjoy everything the Towpath has to offer. It's a mere 13 miles to Cuyahoga National Park to the north and one mile to the south is the downtown Art's District. Akron is doing a lot to bring art and life to the downtown area, and the towpath is the perfect conduit to head to the heart of the city. I recommend walking the path south to Exchange Street, then head to Main Street. Once on South Main, there are several restaurant options, the ball field, and the relic Peanut Shop. Once you hit North Main, you'll land in a cute shopping district with boutiques and the famous Luigi's restaurant (always a wait). The space itself is open and full of windows. The kitchen offers plenty of room, as does the huge dining table. The office bed is a bit too firm, but doable for a weekend. We loved the eco features in the building."

It did take a minute to figure out the Murphy bed, but no problem once I did. It is a little bit on the heavy side, so it could be an accessibility issue if you need both beds. I did appreciate having the desk as well, myself.
Amazing view and my kiddo who loves the train really enjoyed watching it go by each day. Overall a great stay and will likely come back next time we’re in town."

And the Ohio tow path trail is out your window! I took hour long walks in nature every day because it is so close...surrounded by trees and the babbling river/stream. This place gives a feel of urban and nature wrapped up into one! I'd love to stay again!

I stayed at Dan’s place late October, when the trees at the towpath trailhead were still golden. Those trees are what fill the view through the beautiful windows looking out from the main room. Had a fantastic run on the towpath one day. Dinner downstairs at the brewery with a friend; recommend Lock 15! Dan was friendly and responsive throughout, especially to some specific requests I made. I’m an Akron native, and when I visit again will most definitely look to see if Dans place is available."

He gave some great local recommendations that I was able to add to our itinerary. We had never been to Akron and ended up having the absolute best time by staying at this particular location. We weren’t able to do everything we planned on our weekend away and can’t wait to book his place again. There is an awesome brewery below his place great food and drinks. We took a walk in the park across the street and enjoyed the view and the history it provided. His location looks exactly like the photos! Very clean, quiet, and well decorated. I picked this particular place because my spouse is a builder and I knew he would have loved that the building was once a Rubber Factory. We both agreed that this is our favorite airbnb so far and we can’t wait to visit again."

The enormous wooden table is great for hanging out, eating, or working - and it's beautiful, especially with the view of the canal right out the windows. A few things to be aware of, though: Parking (though free! and specific to the building) is in a partially-paved gravel lot. One of the bedrooms has a bed that converts between a desk and a bed, so you have to pull two knobs out to be able to put it down or up - make sure someone in your family/group feels comfortable doing this. The air conditioning unit can get very loud and it echoes. And there are no paper towels or tissues, so you'll want to plan to bring your own if you plan to be making meals or staying for awhile inside the unit."

A few critiques: the towels and bedding weren't great. There weren't any paper towels, Kleenex, soap, shampoo, or conditioner. I know they're not expected, but just a heads up you'll need to purchase if you're flying and unable to bring like we were."

The brewery downstairs has good beer and great food! we didn't have an issue with late night noise like other reviews said. And we had a 12 month baby, and she slept just fine. It is close to Rt8 which will take you quickly to any store you need. Parking was ample and safe and other residents in the building we very nice. I would definitely stay again!"

A few things kept it from 5 stars for us - no soap in the bathroom, a slow tv and remote, the restaurant below sometimes played music late at night, and the murphy bed in the 2nd bedroom wasn't super comfortable. That being said, it's a really nice space and served us well, not to mention Dan was a wonderful host who made sure we knew if we needed anything to just let him know. Would recommend!"

I stayed with my mom and sister, doubling up on the queen and using the Murphy bed. There was more than enough space in the living area for the 3 of us, and we loved playing games at the long dining table (bring your own games!)
We decided to head north and hike, and the local hiking didn’t disappoint. Also hit up the Nomz restaurant (galley style) and would highly recommend for a lunch."

Downstairs is a fantastic brewpub with excellent food, we were very spoiled with that convenience.
The space is very safe in the door codes are easy to use. Plenty of parking and
Privacy, we did not run into other people, surprisingly, that live in the building, it is a very quiet place.
The beds were very comfortable and the bedding itself felt really nice.

Stan Hywet Hall was an unexpected gem in the area, highly recommend if time allows. Comfortable beds, especially the Murphy bed/desk option. Good size for two, could sleep more people but not a lot of ""comfy"" seating beyond two people. Generous kitchen and dining area, coffee filters, salt and pepper provided and basic cooking items. The Brewery on the first level was a great dining option. Was a little noisy on a Sat night, but the HVAC system provides great white noise, so it was easy drown out for sleeping. We really enjoyed our girl's weekend in Akron and exploring the area."

Great trails in the local metro parks and Cuyahoga National Park is only a short drive away. There are more food and beverage options just a short walk away toward downtown Akron.
The second bedroom is what is referred to as the corner office in the listing. The desk is an interesting Murphy bed that unfolds and keeps the desk surface level so you can go from work to bed and back easily and quickly."

Visit Sarah's Vineyard for a beautiful view of the valley with some great wines and food to boot. We discovered The Mustard Seed for a wonderful brunch. Blue Jazz Cafe was a great treat - both for the dinner and the live music after. Will definately be coming back.

It might be a better space for a couple rather than work colleagues because the walls have an opening make it so you can hear what's happening in the other room very clearly. That said my colleague and I loved it and felt like we were in a home away from home. I would stay there again if I'm ever back in Akron. There's a great park right across the street and it's minutes from downtown Akron. Thanks Dan for a lovely space!

The loft itself is stunningly beautiful with amazing windows and natural light. The great room windows overlook the Little Cuyahoga River and were a delight every day. Dan is a great host; in communication when you need him and he left us alone when we didn't. Over the years we have stayed in many short term rentals. I think Dan's tops the list. Thanks, Dan!"

Stayed a few nights",The pictures for the place only give a glimpse to how amazing the loft is. The view of the historic canal and park is calming and beautiful. It was very easy to drive around the city. I imagine even easier when local construction is completed. Dan is a very welcoming host. He took the time to give a tour and share the history of the building and area. He was immediately available throughout and considerate to ask permission for some maintenance to be done during our stay. I was visiting my daughter and enjoyed the opportunity for her to use the unique office/bedroom. It was a beautiful and quiet place to stay. I would definitely enjoy staying for future visits.

There are wonderful local touches: albums by Akron/Ohio artists are available beside the record player, and art of local landmarks appears throughout. Elisha communicated clearly and was friendly and agreeable. I could not recommend The Nook more highly."

The space was well organized and clean. Kitchen had a variety of amenities and was easy to cook in. Bathroom was very serene with great water pressure. Given that it is a garden suite unit, you are able to hear some sounds from the upstairs dwelling. However, Elisha provides a sound machine as well as ear plugs if you are more sensitive to those type of sound disturbances while sleeping. I utilized the sound machine and had no issue falling or staying asleep (and I am typically sensitive to that). It was conveniently located and was easy to get around Akron. If I ever find myself in Akron, I would be sure to stay here again!"

As the description says, “in colder weather you may also hear the lovely clang or occasional bang of our steam heat boiler.” Unfortunately for us, the banging noise was cause for some very disrupted sleep both nights of our stay. It is alarmingly loud when it goes off. Might be ok for heavy sleepers!"

The high glass bock windows let in natural light and there are lots of ceiling canned lights that are on rheostats so you can control the brightness. The kitchen appliances are new and high quality: a full refrigerator, stove, microwave, good coffee maker. I loved the farmhouse sink with a high-end faucet with lots of power. She had many thoughtful touches such as popcorn and hot chocolate and really nice soaps and hand creams. The apartment is also spotlessly clean and is located in an area that is super convenient to Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens. It is just off W Market street with lots of eateries and a really interesting grocery store, the Mustard Seed, within walking distance. The on-street parking was not a problem as her street gets little traffic. Elisha was a great hostess was extremely responsive to any questions that arose."

This little apartment is beautiful, clean, cozy, spacious and private--plus it is much quieter and offers more space and in-room amenities than any hotel (including all-inclusive resorts) that I have ever stayed in! We never had to meet Elisha personally because the check in process was so easy but she made sure to send all instructions we would need to make ourselves at home so we had nothing to worry about and could focus on enjoying our trip. Between her friendliness and all of the thoughtful amenities available here, it felt as comfortable as staying with a friend but still had the quiet and privacy of a house to yourself--its the best of both worlds when you're traveling!

Stayed a few nights","I simply don't have the right words to describe how impressed I was with this host and her space. This Airbnb was GORGEOUS. From top to bottom Elisha put her heart in to making the space beautiful and cozy. Every detail was so thoughtful, all of the decoration seemed intentional and hand picked by a pro. She paid homage to the beauty of the city by including art from local designers to coffee from the local beloved coffee shop for guests to use during their stay. I feel like no Airbnb will ever compare to this one, everything I forgot to think of, this host thought of for me and prepared for me when she didn't have to. Her, her husband, and her puppy were incredible people and I couldn't be more grateful for this stay. It shocked me how this was so affordable while being so luxury, CLEAN and in the best location at the same time. My friend stopped by to visit during my stay, and as a local, she now hopes to book here for a home away from home get away. THANK YOU ELISHA!"

Stayed one night","This was probably one of the most well-decorated Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in, very comfy yet aesthetic. Pretty safe neighborhood but I was only there for one night. Plenty of food options in the area. My only complaint is that it is a basement apartment and so you could hear people walking around upstairs which wasn’t terrible but at night there were noises (air ducts and plumbing related) that made it hard to sleep. There are earplugs provided but I didn’t use them and maybe that would have solved that issue."

Stayed one night","I cannot say enough about Elisha and her place. It is such a gem. Right in the heart of a walkable and friendly neighborhood. A cute little market with tons of healthy food, even for vegans like me. There’s a coffee shop just down the street, several restaurants and each seems to play live music on various nights throughout the week. There are a few gyms within 10-15 min drive.
Elisha’s place is just as described. It is well stocked, clean, comfortable and every detail thought about. The Wi-Fi worked beautifully, the bed was so comfortable and it was just so cozy. Elisha is extremely responsive, helpful, and kind. I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Location location location! I grew up in Akron, in another neighborhood, but whenever I come back I love to go to Highland Square. It’s a walkable neighborhood, lots of different, interesting folks who live and hang out there, has a creative vibe. I’m a coffee lover so the fact that I could walk less than 5 minutes to Angel Falls in the morning was a joy. Mustard Seed Market is even closer, and has all the natural groceries you might want. There are bars, which I didn’t go to, but they look fun
The Nook itself, the airbnb, is really nicely done—recently renovated with high quality materials, really a pleasant space, and it’s all sparkling clean. While it is technically a below ground space, it doesn’t feel like it; they’ve installed nice windows that are above ground and let light in.
Communication w Elisha and Michael was friendly, helpful, and easy."

Elisha was welcoming, helpful, and responsive. The location was one block from W. Market and there are so many restaurants and stores either an easy walk away or a short drive. Mustard Seed Grocery and Cafe is a mere two blocks! You can't go wrong staying here!"

I’m not much for on street parking in this cold weather but at least there wasn’t snow plows! The Nook is a perfect place to stay for sure but I am not used to the broiler for heat and hot water so that took time to get used to the noise as I was sleeping and would hear it kick in and didn’t know what the noise was!! Definitely recommend this Nook for sure. It was extremely clean and welcoming for sure and the host was awesome!!!! Thanks again for a great week.

Stayed with a pet","Beverly is a fabulous host. She reached out several times before our trip to provide updates and helpful information. Once we go there, we found instructions on the door to help us get in. The house was so well appointed that she needs to offer a master class service to other hosts. It had everything we could ask for and all of it was in great condition. The house was updated and comfortable, she had even prepped for our dogs arrival. The backyard is fully fenced, but due to the snow melt there was mud - no issue for Beverly - she instructed us on how to use the basement rinse off shower and provided a doggy wash station. There is enough room to park two cars safely off street. The neighborhood is very quiet, and the beds are very comfortable, we slept great every night!"

Plenty of soap/shampoo, etc., hair dryer, toiletries, snacks, delicious coffee. Local menus in the house manual. Easy to record TV shows (I really wanted to see Queen Elizabeth’s funeral but we had a busy schedule.) Quiet, tidy neighborhood, and one side of the house overlooks a grassy meadow. The grass back yard is large and fenced. Nearby Stan Hywet Hall house and gardens are beautiful. We were delighted to get to attend it’s annual Sept. car show, included in the affordable entry fee (there’s a Father Day car show, too, we were told.)
Easy access to nearby highways for our travels to Cleveland and Columbus, although locally we drove along the scenic rivers and wished we had time to bike the trails. A large shopping mall and many local and chain restaurants are a few minutes away."

It could definitely use a reno, but Beverly has added really nice touches throughout. In addition to a Keurig stocked with many pods as well as tea, sweetener, and spices, there were snacks and water available when we arrived. Other nice touches were a Brita water filter pitcher, excellent water pressure, water that heated quickly, and motion-controlled lights on the porch. The sofas and beds were comfortable, and our dogs loved running in the backyard. So while there were definitely some drawbacks, Beverly clearly takes a lot of care to appoint everything nicely."

Stayed with a pet","Charming and nviting small house in a great neighborhood near several grocery options and many restaurants.
Beverly has stocked this house with everything you can think of and everything you might have forgotten. Bedrooms were nicely decorated and had comfy beds. Extra pillows and blankets available. The window air conditioners did a good job cooling on hot summers nights. Bathrooms were well supplied with all your wants.
Great fenced in backyard for dogs. Our two enjoyed roaming around the yard and when they didn't want any more sun they came under the carport which has a gate blocking it from the driveway so they were safe and secure. House was beyond pet friendly, with dog toys, dishes a bed and crate and towels for a rainy day. Also treats in a cute jar on top of the refrigerator. The whole house felt very homey with just the right amount of tasteful knickknacks. I've rented many houses over the years and Beverly's is tops in my book. Will definitely rent again when I'm back in the area."

Great location, albeit a bit hard to find using G**gle Maps for some reason (which sends you into a neighborhood across the street - make sure to double check your route once you get into Akron).
Apartment was incredibly clean, open, bright lighting, etc. Bed was comfortable, water pressure was great. Only flag is that there was no laundry soap for the washer - So check to make sure that is either included in the rental or if it's something you need to bring yourself, as we assumed the former.

Stayed a few nights","Host was kind and accommodating. When I read the home description, I thought I was going to share the bathroom with the owner. They have two other rooms for rent and have to share with them as well. The host kept the bathroom clean.
One of the guests had a small child who cried a lot. My room was facing the street so you could hear the cars drive and having older windows the cold breeze was felt.
The home is old and every single step, door opening and stairs are loud.
The room had clean sheets and towels. It is a place for a night or so but not for a vacation.
If noise isn’t a problem for you, this is an affordable place that is clean. Make sure if you stay here in the summer, you pick a room with A/C. The home was very hot but the room had a window unit. The last two days it got cold out and only one night the heat was turned on.
I would stay here again but making sure no kids are staying in the other rooms.
Oh, plenty of space to park.
Thank you for hosting me."

Both Luki and Nate have hosted on my last 15+ stays in Akron and they have been wonderful. If an issue ever arose the solution was promptly found, they have also been flexible when my work schedule meant that my stay had to be extended or adjusted.
On my final stay with them in Akron I was kindly left a care package with a variety of gifts and well wishes, this was a very kind gesture that shows the good character and nature of these hosts.
Once again, I would highly recommend this AirBnB as a nice, safe, cozy place to stay when traveling to the Rubber City!

Great location, good bed and kitchen supplies, clean and complete shared-bathroom, few steps away from bus stop in a friendly neighborhood.
There are about three other people coming in/out in the house, with different and flexible schedules so a shared bathroom might turn inconvenient at some times.
Also, the house is pretty old so the floor is SUPER squeaky, the walls soundproof-less and the windows' glass very thin... so you'll hear everything inside and outside the house - fortunately, the hosts are aware of this and provide white noise machine and ear-plugs."

Stayed a few nights","THIS!!!! Perfect location for my contract at Akron children's hospital. My commute was 6 minutes!! Although I did not get to meet Nate personally during my one week stay, his house manager, Loki, made me very comfortable. I stay in airbnbs on a regular basis and also own one, so I've seen it all! This one makes my top 5 favorite. I'm very cold natured, and the temperature of this home was actually warm enough for me. In other homes I've felt very cold even wearing thick pajamas. I like that each room has their own window air conditioner so each guest can choose how cool they'd like to be. All the other guests here are professionals, and none of them smoke. i did go out and buy a pillow because I'm a pillow snob. NOTE; I believe the house next door is occupied by mentally handicapped men. They sit on the front porch and smoke.They are harmless."

They have thought of everything from shower/bath products to even a First Aid kit in the bathroom! In the kitchen there is a coffee maker, coffee and a nice assortment of tea's, condiments, etc. My bed was very comfortable and I slept well. Bedroom was well equipped with a fan, hangers in the closet, power strips, and even a sound machine! Wi-fi worked well and was easy to access with the posted PW on the night table. Wooden floors throughout and the staircase are a bit noisy & squeaky - I was fine with it, but afraid my walking around would disturb the other guests. Glad I brought my slippers!!!"

The neighborhood is eclectic and safe. Luki is an ideal host. She greeted me when I checked in, gave me a tour, and showed me how to work the many amenities the place has to offer. Response times before, during, and after booking were nearly immediate. The room is spacious and well-appointed, and everything in the house is spotlessly clean.
