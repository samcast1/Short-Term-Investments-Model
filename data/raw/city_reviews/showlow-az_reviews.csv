Stayed a few nights","Thank you, Chuck and Annie, for your hospitality. The cabin was awesome, very clean, and we were very impressed with how detailed it was equipped from the kitchen to the bathroom and laundry. I stayed in another Airbnb, and your cabin by far is the best one. I felt like I was home, and the community was very clean and peaceful.
I highly recommend The Cabbage/cabin"

Group trip","Kathryn was so responsive from the moment we began talking. I had a few questions before checking in, including asking about early check-in. She was more than accommodating to all my requests. She was also very timely and responded quickly. All instructions were clear, and she followed up and checked in on a couple occasions.
The place was beautiful! Many private acres of land in the forest. So many activities, games, and things to do. It was perfect for our large family. We had plenty of space and bedrooms for us all to fit comfortably. We loved the kitchen. It had every utensil imaginable.
We will be back! Next time we are hoping to stay longer and be able to use even more of the amenities.
Highly recommend !"

Stayed one night","Went up to Show Low for a memorial service for a friend and needed a place to stay for the night. This place met our needs. We really only needed a place to sleep as we were busy at the memorial and spending time with family and friends. We also planned and were up and gone very early as we had a long drive back to the valley. This place was perfect. It was relatively easy to find, and very quiet! It was clean, and easy to get in to. My husband and I are private people and having the host on the same property made us a little uncomfortable, but as stated it was only for one night and a place to sleep and the major selling point was it was affordable, which made it worth it."

Stayed one night","This is a cute place perfect for a couple that wants to escape to the mountains and have some alone time. The pictures are misleading because Gerry's place is more charming in person. This is a smaller mobile home, like a time capsule of what a tiny home was in the '60s. Fun and nostalgic! The area is peaceful and quiet, and only a couple minutes back to civilization. Gerry lives next door so is responsive and friendly. We would stay again!
We had all the amenities, linens, hygiene products, coffee, and towels. Plus clear instructions of expectations and recommendations of local restaurants."

The kitchen was well-equipped. The bed was comfortable. And there was plenty of space for my husband and I. It got a little warm in the afternoon the week we were there, but with the windows open and fan running, it was never a problem. Nights were lovely and we even got a distant view through the trees of the Fourth of July fireworks in Show Low. We would happily stay again."

It is parked on the the same lot as the owners live.
It is Very clean, Very private, away from the town, yet Walmart is close by if needed.
It is very conveniently located right next to Show Low lake, where you can fish, boat, swim, camp, or hike the trail around the lake.
. The hosts, were awesome, very kind, helpful, & informative! The price was Perfect!

Stayed over a week","My stay at this Park Model trailer in Show Low was comfortable and my host made an effort to make sure I had the necessities I needed during my stay. I stayed a little over a month and there is lots of storage space that was convenient for all the items brought with me. Air conditioning is not available but the trailer is under some trees which helped it stay cooler, and the additional fans I brought with me helped on the hotter days. There is also a nice outdoor table and chairs with an umbrella so you can enjoy the fresh air and smell of the pines. I slept well in the comfortable bed, and there were adequate but sparse cooking utensils for making simple meals. Since we are in the midst of a pandemic I choose to social distance and wear a mask in public for my safety and the safety of others and do not gather in large groups. However, my host made it clear that she does not abide by these safety guidelines in her daily life, but she was respectful of my request for keeping socially distant. If this is of concern for you regarding where you choose to stay, then this may not be the best choice for your stay in the Show Low area."

Stayed with kids","“Dream Home” - The first words I spoke out loud as I walked into the Modern Black Cabin! Amanda, you have been by far THE BEST host I have ever witnessed! Your home is truly a master piece & I can’t begin to tell you how much my family enjoyed our stay. If you are in the White Mountains area, PLEASE DO YOURSELF AN HONOR & STAY HERE! This home has everything you can think of, especially for kids and toddlers/babies. During our stay, we felt comfortable knowing that Amanda had everything planned out for our stay and every household item you can even think of! I love the Guest Book and the Welcome Binder for the guests! I can’t wait to be back, as I did not want to leave this outstanding home! The host, Amanda, is so nice and very welcoming (even before you arrive, too!) I don’t think I’ll ever get over my “high” of how gorgeous this home was and how well-thought out everything was. Again, 10/10 recommend and can’t wait to visit the Modern Black Cabin soon! Thank you for everything! Yay!"

Traveling with 3 kids 3 and under is no small task, but our hosts were extremely accommodating. They had a pack n play complete with clean sheets. They had a changing pad with a clean cover. Our older boys were comfy and cozy in the bunk room! They enjoyed the many books available in the room as well. There were also a plethora of toys to keep them entertained. The kids also loved the playhouse and swings outside.
We enjoyed eating outside on the deck and used the gas grill available to us. It was such a serene setting to sit out and enjoy the cooler temperatures.
We loved their recommendations for food and activities!
The hosts have truly thought of EVERYTHING you could possibly want or ask for. From dishes and utensils to a coffee maker and condiments to extra sheets and towels to Netflix and more! Would recommend 10/10!"

The design and functionality of the house is perfect. It was a truly enjoyable time. This house is perfect for staying with children. My granddaughters were thrilled to have an airbnb already with toys and activities to entertain them. The cost was unbelievable and so much better than if we had stayed in a resort or high-end hotel. I recommend 100%!!!!!!

Beautiful sunrises and sunsets on the deck, peaceful quiet evenings and dark enough to see the milkyway! We got to see the moon rise which was different from what we see in the city. Barbara and Clark were very generous of their time in providing us a tour of their farm and generous with the information of what they know about homestead living. We initially came out here to stay since we were feeling the area to move and buy property. Can we just say that we found our location?! Concho is a beautiful place of AZ and Barbara and Clark gave us a ton of insights about the town and community. Their place felt super homey and was very clean and comfortable. You will not be disappointed in staying here. If you want to getaway from the noise and have a taste of homesteading and off grid living, this is the place for you! Thank you again Barbara and Clark! Well be neighbors soon! =)"

The Loft is airy with plenty of natural light and the windows and ceiling fans kept the room cool at night. Shower is clean and hot with great water pressure and we loved the soaps and hair care products. The Loft is wonderfully quiet with an occasional distant coyote, goat, dog, or fowl momentarily breaking the silence. There’s no keypad or key, but the door is lockable and boltable from the inside and we felt perfectly safe given the remote location. Hosts were friendly, informative, and didn’t intrude as they went about their daily chores. An excellent value and very private to boot!"

Thank you so much! We will definitely want to do that again sometime."

I will definitely share this experience with others and would stay here again when in the area. My only recommendation is if you are planning on staying a couple days make sure to bring some spices and condiments as there was none. Coming from across country it was items I did not have with me.

Even though the cabin is in a housing community it felt very private! There was a nice little park that we could take our kids too, so that was a nice surprise. This cabin had everything we needed. We cooked most meals in the cabin with ease or used the bbq on the back porch. The beds were very comfortable too! Another plus was her cabin is dog friendly! We all had a great time and I would definitely recommend Sara’s cabin to anyone! It was just perfect! I hope to stay there again in the future. Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was cozy, peaceful and lovely. Everything was wonderful here except a few basic amenities were lacking (Keurig coffee maker was broken and no coffee pot, leak in master bath shower that made it unusable). Most likely not a common trend for this listing because the hosts were very responsive and kind, but it was a bit of a bummer to not have those amenities. Overall it was a great place in a good location and was a great deal cost-wise."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I took a last minute trip up to the mountains to escape the crowded / warmer area and this cabin did not disappoint! From the get go we were impressed with the area and appearance upon arrival. The outside scenery was beautiful and the interior of the cabin surpassed expectations- it was cleaner than most Airbnbs we’ve stayed at and we loved the decor! It was nice to be in a quiet area though we did realize it was more of a residential neighborhood of cabins rather than somewhere far out in the woods, but it was fine. It was only ~6 minutes from Safeway so that was convenient. There was a neighborhood park down the street which would be nice for families. The master bed was very comfy, we didn’t use the bunk beds but they seemed comfy as well and were a double bed on both top and bottom making it nice for families. The cabin had pretty much everything we could need except maybe an ice scraper for the car since it snowed. Prompt communication with Sara. we’ll be back!"

It was impeccably clean and had everything we needed for our stay, with the exception of a corkscrew for our wine, which was easily obtained at the Ace Hardware Store on Deuce of Clubs. Karen left directions for the wi-fi (which was excellent) as well as cookies and breakfast biscotti for us as a welcome. The cabin is spacious and tastefully furnished and the neighborhood turned out to be very peaceful, which we appreciated. There are several lakes close by, Fool Hollow Lake offering picnic ramadas and hiking trails. We stayed for five days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. By the way, although we didn't need or use it, upstairs there is a really special kids' room for two."

Strong wi-fi and on-site aundry. We were just visiting family and it made an easy central hub that was a 5min drive from restaurants and cafes. It’s in a neighborhood with minimal noise (like dogs barking) but nothing intrusive and mostly quiet. The neighborhood is older and rougher, but the lights and gate add a sense of safety.

Stayed one night","What a meticulously decorated little cabin. Lovely and cozy in and out. I stayed for one night while driving through AZ. Slept great. Enjoyed the lovely front porch. Carol was so welcoming, friendly, and accomodating. It's evident that she loves this cabin and wants her guests to love it to. 😊 Google maps was a little confused about how to get me into the neighborhood, so I'd recommend reviewing written directions from Hwy 77, especially if arriving at night."

I cant imagine a better way to end one day and start the next! Truly a tonic for what ails. The only downside to staying there on my way from Abiqui, NM to Tucson was that I had a schedule to keep and had to leave after just one night. I sure hope good fortune will bring me to the area again to rest my head at this lovely place."

Tucked away in a serene setting, the cabin was a perfect blend of comfort, charm, and modern amenities.

Stayed one night","Diana’s little “Bluebird Cabin” is a must-see (and stay at)! It’s truly amazing how she and her husband have created a Route-66 and Coca Cola-themed getaway for two. Their creative attention to detail combined with a gift for hospitality made our stay a memorable one. The space is small but well utilized and we didn’t feel cramped. We used the outdoor griddle to cook scrambled eggs. Diana’s communication was good- she let me know about an alternate street to take as one of their streets were impassable. A twinkie or 2, a delicious muffin, and a gluten-free energy bar for my wife was icing on the cake!"

a work of art & craftsmanship with an extraordinary amount of fun & pleasure added in. The period momentos all around become embedded in the very comfortably appointed cottage. It was a bright & cheery overnight rest stop while passing thru & though it is small, it lacks nothing for comfort & aesthetics.
Thank you Diana, for all the treats, & the yummy banana
muffins for breakfast. We will surely make this stop again when passing thru next time.

Stayed one night","This is the best lodging between Eastern Utah and Tucson. Not everyone has the sensibility to get ambience right, but Diana definitely got it right. Cozy, but well-laid out so that you never feel cramped. In fact, I'd say it felt bigger than the photos allowed. The fridge was big enough for my cooler food. There was enough coffee. Shower water hot, quickly. Cold tap tasted good so I could fill my travel jug. Porch -even though it was blustery, I still chose to sit on the comfortable outdoor chair before sundown to read. The yard is enclosed which feels private and buffers from the wind if its blowing. The porch faces Arizona sunsets, there's a grill if you want it, and night lighting too. Definitely will stay here again when coming through."

There were cool drinks and snacks in the fridge, a variety of instant oatmeal on the shelf, more snacks and a banana in a basket on the table, and a homemade muffin ready for breakfast! That is over and above thoughtfulness.
I’ve already recommended it to friends!
Thank you Diana for creating such a lovely space. ❤️"

Stayed one night","My best friend and I stayed at this lovely cabin for a night after a day at the Petrified Forest National Park.
Diana and Jerry were very accommodating, allowing us to check in between 3pm - 8pm. This was really helpful between the drive and our day at the park as that can sometimes be a little hard to plan time wise. Diana was there to welcome us and immediately made the place comfortable showing us around the cabin and having left snacks there for us to munch on. This space has a lot of great features such as a TV with apps on it, a coloring book, a journal, books, and a cute and private backyard space. The stars were incredible at night!
As my friend and I were checking out, both Diana and Jerry came out to show us a few of their unique possessions that Jerry built himself. It’s pretty cool stuff, and inspiring as two people who love and adore adventurous lifestyles. Anyways, they were super friendly, the place was adorable, and we’d love to visit again. Thanks to the hosts!"

I was grateful that Diana had snacks in the cabin since I had driven several hours to get there and didn't want to head back into town to find food. Diana has thought of everything and provided easy instructions inside the cupboard for accessing wifi and other details. The shower was excellent. I slept well and was able to get some work done before stepping out in the little backyard to watch the sunset and stars. Diana clearly enjoys hosting guests and it was a nice place to stay. I even got kind help from someone in town with my low air in the rental car tires. Made me glad I chose to stay here.

Her cabin was so cozy warm when we arrived after dark on a very cold evening! We easily found her place. She was waiting with a flashlight to guide us in. It was PERFECT! So many things we loved about Bluebird cabin: Toasty warm cabin and reception by Diana, careful/clear instructions on using everything in the cabin, ceramic heater right next to the toilet in the bathroom (what an unexpected pleasure for midnight bathroom trips!), super comfortable bed with flannel sheets, wonderfully delicious homemade muffins, great restaurant recommendations, fully stocked mini kitchen for an easy breakfast, maps/guides for local exploring, completely private, beautiful night sky, great conversation with Diana and her husband when leaving!

One thing that is good to note for those used to a contactless check in is that Diana greets you in the driveway when you arrive. We arrived later than expected, and didn’t realized this as we are used to self check in- we felt so bad for keeping Diana and her husband up so late to check us in but they were so friendly, loving and giving!

Stayed with a pet","Diana is the most wonderful host! She met us upon arrival and was an absolute delight. The unit is beautiful and sparkling clean and the property is quiet and isolated, a great place to get away & relax. In the morning before our departure, Diana brought us ice for our cooler of food and spent some time talking to us. We could have spent all day talking to her, she is so sweet and hospitable & makes the best blueberry muffins! We will certainly be back for another stay soon."

The host even amazing! She met us when we got there, walked us through the property showing us where everything was, suggested many different places to eat and even fun things to do. She made sure that we had everything that we may need and more! She was so cute, made us little treats and had snacks/drinks ready for our stay. Totally worth the price and would definitely visit again!!! If we could give more than 5 stars, we would!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here on a solo trip with plans to visit Petrified Forest National park and do some hiking. This place was just perfect! Diana and Jerry are wonderful people and made me feel right at home. This is a very thoughtfully crafted space, and I loved spending my mornings and evenings on the porch and watching the variety of birds. Diana gave me some great recommendations in the surrounding area, including the West Baldy Trail that I did. What a beautiful and enjoyable hike! My visit to the Petrified Forest (second part of which is the Painted Desert) was fantastic! What a great experience, and not that far. I also explored some of the old Route 66 relics, and made a stop over in Winslow. On my drive back home, I stopped at Woods Canyon Lake to walk the Mogollon Rim. Another recommendation from Diana that was spot on - what beautiful views! I loved the farm fresh eggs and other little surprise treats :). I will definitely stay here again when visiting the area!"

She also took time to talk to us about the beautiful pieces she and her husband had included in the cabin. No detail was forgotten. What was the perfect addition was farm fresh eggs we were able to enjoy along with some pancakes we made on an outdoor griddle.

The cottage itself was very well equipped with not just the essentials but plenty of other creature comforts. Beyond that, the decor around the cottage was beautiful and homey. Lastly, Diana and Jerry were very forthcoming with helping us plan the rest of our trip and shared their advice on what we absolutely had to see in the area.

The cabin itself is very well-adorned and comfortable. My favorite part, though, was the back porch, where at night you could see ALL of the stars! I sat out back with my kindle, reading and stargazing. It was quite magical! Mornings out back were lovely, too, and Diana and Jerry provide nice hefty blankets as well. There were snacks, and even a muffin each morning, which I appreciated as I've been on the road. While chatting with Diana, her enthusiasm for my plans (I went to the Petrified Forest) made me excited to adventure! I also felt quite safe here. I would absolutely recommend this stay to anyone."

Diana and Larry have the PERFECT getaway for a solo traveler or couple. I arrived hours early (I misread the check in time) and was greeted with warm hospitality regardless. Diana was so very helpful with explaining how things worked. With welcoming, lighthearted humor, she gave me a tour of their spectacular accommodations. This Air BNB raises the bar for the ""super host"" experience in my opinion. The ""Wee Cottage"" was private, well thought out, and exactly what I was hoping for. I stayed cozy and warm even while it was snowing!
I cannot think of one aspect of my trip that did not exceed my expectations.
As if all this wasn't enough, the day I was scheduled to depart, it was snowing with a winter storm warning. Diana and Larry offered and encouraged me to extend my stay until it was safer to travel. I appreciate the solace they provided to me during a very difficult time. I cannot wait to visit again!

Stayed one night","My husband and I had an incredible stay here!!! We only stayed here for one night on our way back through Northern Arizona’s national parks, but it was a highlight of our trip. The cottage was extremely cozy and comfortable, and Diana was beyond sweet. She met us as we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed, and generously gave us some food and snacks. It was so nice chatting with her and getting a little tour so we knew where everything was.
The cottage itself was even nicer than pictured, and everything was spotless. It was adorable, particularly the fenced in porch area in the back. I’ve never seen a cuter back deck and especially appreciated the fake truck built into the wall with the Route 66 sign. With its flickering lights, it was so adorable! We made sure to get pictures on it before we left.
I definitely wish we had time in our schedule to stay more than one night because our visit was so peaceful and restorative. I can’t recommend the cottage or Diana enough!"

Stayed one night","Diana's place is brand new, cozy, and meticulous. Felt super safe. Perfection is an understatement. I was pleasantly surprised how close the property was to great food in either Snow Flake or Show Low. My wife and I stayed a night and I skied at Sunrise Park. From the valley (Gilbert) it was a perfect getaway. Arrived early which Diana so kindly allowed. My wife went with Diana and some local friends to a local concert :). I jumped in the car drove to Sunrise Park...a ski resort I had never been to. On the way I rented skis in Pine Top, for next to nothing, then made my way to Sunrise and enjoyed a half day of skiing. The resort is beautiful the drive was a blast. Location was perfect. Diana you will have to put up with us again :). You are about to get discovered."

Stayed one night","Diana and Jerry's place is impeccable. It was built with love and attention to all the details to make your stay as comfortable as possible... AND, they continue to make additions to elevate the experience. The stars at night were beautiful. The fence created a very private space. The bed was very comfortable, which is the most important thing for us. Diana is very well connected in the community and has a wealth of knowledge on a large variety of topics. We could've talked to her for hours about everything and anything. If you have any questions about what to see, what to do, where to eat, etc... Diana will not steer you wrong! Diana loves her Airbnb and is dedicated and passionate in sharing her home with others. You will NOT regret staying here. The only regret you will have it not staying longer! We will definitely be back whenever we are in the area."

Stayed with a pet","Home away from home. The place was amazing and the hospitality was beyond our expectations. The love and care was felt since we booked and even after we left. They were very accommodating to our dog Kal-El. We felt welcomed since day one. And the fact that they made Kal feel
Welcomed was the cherry on top. My only regret was not being able to spend more time at the cabin since we were out and about exploring. Diana and Jerry were super host and went above and beyond. The craftsmanship at the place was amazing and the set up for photos on the backyard was amazing. Kal was honored the be one of the first to take his picture there. We will definitely be back and do some stargazing in spring. We loved everything about this place. By far the best Airbnb that we have stayed at."

Stayed one night","Wee cottage, do not let the name of this gem cause you to not come and enjoy! What an incredible find this was for my husband and I! Not only the cottage, but the awesome owners....Diana & Jerry! (no wonder there are 40+ reviews all a 5 star!!!
Where do I even start to paint the picture of this gem. From the moment you pull into the parking area for the cottage, which is right in front of the cottage you feel welcomed. Diana & Jerry met us and showed us the way. As you walkthrough the gate entrance to the cottage you enter a clean quaint welcoming covered porch. Outside of a bed on the porch, everything you need is right on the covered porch area, love, love this. Through the front door, you walk into a very clean, cozy, fully furnished tiny house.....""wee cottage"". There was coffee, tea, fresh eggs, fun & nutritional snacks, & drinks, along with a fully stocked kitchen area if needed. A comfy bed with quality linens. The shower......we so appreciated the way the shower was done that we even had communication with Jerry to get his ideas on it! Hot water, no worries.....plenty for the two of us even with the brisk weather:)
Diana and Jerry have definitely spent many hours to have this cottage come alive with a desire to use repurposed materials and a fun theme.....absolutely fun & gorgeous.
You will NOT be disappointed. We are already trying to secure additional dates in November at the cottage!!"

Couldn’t have picked a better place to stay for an area that was unknown to us and their knowledge of the area and suggestions for what to see and where to eat were on point. We would 100% stay there again!

We were getting married in snowflake and Diana made sure we knew that she would do everything in her power to make it special for us! It was nice and clean when we came in. Check in was simple. She walked us through all the ins and out of the cottage. She showed us what special and cool things that went on in and out side of the cottage. Plus, she was always willing to answer any questions we had to make our stay more comfortable!
Overall, she treated us with care and became apart of the magic of our wedding day in a time that would be stressful for most. We would definitely recommend and look forward to our next stay in Taylor.
Thank you Diana!"

This “wee cottage” fulfills that! It meets my other 3 “c’s”…clean, comfortable and close. It’s close to many activities, sights, shopping and awesome restaurants. EVERYtime I looked, I found a different design element I hadn’t noticed before! I loved having coffee or wine ..quite honestly I could have spent my whole time there.. on the peaceful porch being divebombed and visited by hummingbirds!!💕❤️🙃. I hope all that are blessed enough to enter the doors of this sanctuary, treat it with the love and respect it was built with."

The master bedroom has the main road by it and there was some traffic noise but I imagine could be noisier during busier months.

I was visiting for work and being able to rest on my days off was wonderful. The bed was divine and so spacious. The bedding kept me warm on those cold nights. I loved having a home away from home, everything was already there for me and as a travel nurse that was the cherry on top. Being able to cook dinners as if I were in my own home was also a plus. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything I could possibly need to cook, bake, eat whatever I felt like making. Towels, toilet paper etc were there in case I needed and made arriving very stress free. Christie was great at communicating and accessing the home was as easy as punching in a few numbers. The area was very nice and safe. Parking was right in front and we never had issues with neighbors. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a nice little getaway to relax. The little details in this home make it all so cozy. The fire place was also a plus! There is even a little patio to relax outside to enjoy the beautiful outdoor scenery. I hope everyone’s stay is just as enjoyable as ours was!"

Group trip","We had a wedding to attend in the area and wanted a place big enough for extended family to stay together. This home was perfect! We had plenty of beds, plenty of bathrooms and plenty of common area space. We really enjoyed the ping-pong and pool table - it was great fun for the family! We even took advantage of the swings on the front porch and the huge hot tub on the back deck. Everything was clean. When we asked a question, we got an immediate response!"

Group trip","From the moment we drove up, the house did not disappoint. Spacious driveway; enough space for five convertibles, large porch overlooking the ninth hole, the great room is, well GREAT. The kitchen was a dream. Only one little thing; we didn’t bring pods because we were unaware the coffee maker was a Keurig. Otherwise, well stocked kitchen!
Everyone raved about the bedrooms, baths, and game room.
We will return here."

Very close to Fools Hollow State Park. 5-7 drive to the grocery store and Planet Fitness. The Hot Tub was a HIT!!! Game room, added touch!!! All bedrooms are spaced out providing privacy, excluding the bunk room, which shares a bathroom with one of the bedrooms. There is plenty of seating and room to hang out. Such a lovely home!!!!! We would rent again, no question."

I had a few questions for Nate and he responded almost instantaneously, it was a relief to know that the host was available at any time. The house is across a very large open golf course and easily accessible to the stores that are a short 8 minute drive. I love the modernity of the house and the multiple primary bedrooms were a plus!

Stayed with kids","We had the pleasure of spending Thanksgiving weekend at this charming Airbnb in Show Low, AZ. As we walked in, we were greeted by a warm ambiance and thoughtful amenities. The cozy living room, and amazing open floor plan made it easy for the family to mingle together. The attention to detail in the decor and furnishings was evident. The kitchen was well-equipped with everything we needed to prepare our Thanksgiving meal. The dining area was spacious, allowing our family to gather around a beautifully set table and enjoy our meal together. The bedrooms were equally impressive, featuring comfortable beds and quality linens that ensured a restful night's sleep. What truly sets this Airbnb apart, however, is the exceptional hospitality of the hosts. From the moment we inquired about the property, they were responsive, accommodating, and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable.
Many thanks to the hosts for making our holiday truly special!"

I was so excited when I saw that it was available for the weekend of our family get together. The home was designed perfectly and really makes a statement when you pull up. Plenty of rooms and beds for everyone and even a private suite above the garage for couple with a small infant. The common area has 3 different dinning surfaces and lots of chairs for large gatherings. We look forward to coming up and staying again."

A community playground was only steps away! The home was very neat and clean and had everything we needed. We also checked out the nearby recreational park that Kierra suggested and were able to do some fishing and just take it the scenery. We will definitely book again in the future!

This cabin has everything you need to cook and eat, just bring the food! The host is very responsive to e-mails. Even brand-new toothbrushes still in the packaging were stocked in the bathrooms! Lastly, there is a really nice private park right around the corner from the cabin. We will book a stay here again."

There was plenty of essentials in the kitchen to cook. The beds are very soft and there were a lot of blankets so if you go in the winter you'll be golden! It's just a short drive to town to grocery shop or sit down at a restaurant. You'll enjoy your time here!

Stayed with kids","This is the first vacation rental we have had that exceeded my expectations. The pictures do not do it justice and the house was more accommodating to a large group than I imagined. It is a well thought out rental. It makes great use of the space, is clean, comfortable and prime location. We enjoyed crawdad hunting each day. The owners were a wealth of information to help us make the best of the area and were very attentive. Their expectations and information were clear and helpful. They had so much available for us to use like tables, chairs, fire sticks and kayaks that we could have left half of what we brought with us at home. They have been very thoughtful as they invested in having a very welcoming, efficient rental. I’m thankful that they accommodated our large group and excited to take my kids and friends back next time. To be honest, I’m very jealous of their amazing Airbnb- it was the perfect place and home for our youth retreat."

The house was so spacious and the kitchen space really allowed for so many of us to be in there cooking at once. I also celebrated my 30th birthday that weekend and it was just beautiful scenery, and such a cozy cabin. We also loved the location because we had a Walmart around the corner as well as a hospital. Cooking tamales and having carne asada at this cabin with my family will definitely be one of my favorite memories. I recommend this home, Rob was attentive and allowed us to stay a couple hours past check out so we could finish watching the World Cup which was an intense game! Thank you Rob, my family and I really enjoyed ourselves!"

Stayed with kids","We had a large group of 4 different families. The house was perfect. Kitchen was large enough to cook for so many people. We had everything we needed and if we forgot anything Walmart was around the corner. I loved that there were extra tables and chairs available for us to all hang out around the fire pit. The backyard is amazing, kids had fun on the trampoline and the National Forest is literally your backyard. The walk to the creek was perfect. The lake was near by which was so much fun, as we got to use the kayaks that were available.
THE ONE THING I APPRECIATED MOST ABOUT THE WHOLE TRIP WAS THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE HOST, ROB. I HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER EXPERIANCE WHEN IT CAME TO STAYING SOMEWHERE THAT WAS NOT HOME.
AS SOMEONE WHO PUT THE TRIP TOGETHER FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IT GOT A LITTLE STRESSFUL AT TIMES, BUT ONE THING I NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT WAS BEING IGNORED IF I HAD ANY QUESTIONS.
REACHING OUT TO ROB IF NEEDED FOR ANYTHING, WAS ALWAYS A QUICK RESPONSE. EVEN BEFORE THE TRIP ROB WAS NICE ENOUGHT TO HELP ME FIND A LOCAL BAKERY FOR A BDAY PARTY.
HE DEFINITLY GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND. WE DEFINITLY WILL HEAD BACK AND STAY AT THIS CABIN AGAIN. THANK YOU."

Stayed a few nights","We have nothing but good words to say about this property!
This was our first family Airbnb trip and we were surprised how great it was.
First, the location of the cabin is excellent! It’s in the woods, with an easy hike to the creek but on the other hand it’s a few minute drive to Walmart, Walgreens and Home Depot which was very helpful. Also it’s about 30-40 minute drive to Pine Top and Greer.
Second, the cabin itself is beautiful! Very comfortable for a few families. Super spacious, large backyard with a swing, BBQ, and a fire pit.
Kids bedrooms and game room is upstairs so both parents and kids have their privacy.
The kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms are fully loaded with everything you need. Also, there are so many extra towels and linens.
The hostesses are very helpful and nice. We loved the s’mores kit that was left especially for us on the table when we entered.
Great experience! We will definitely book again!"

Stayed with kids","Rob’s place was one of our favorite Airbnb experiences ever. It is such a great set up for large families. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials. Which is a big deal when you are feeding a crowd.
The home is spacious and comfortable. It’s a great layout for a large group. We didn’t feel crowded even though there was a lot of us.
The kids loved the pool table and other games in the game room. We all enjoyed exploring the trails through the forest just off the back patio.
Rob is quick to communicate and very accommodating.
We were welcomed with ingredients to make s’mores which was a nice touch.
I can’t recommend this place enough for a large family or group."

Stayed with kids",For anyone who loves the outdoors & wants the “Dream Get Away” with family and friends this is the place to be! Very cozy atmosphere with plenty of space and fully stocked kitchen at your disposal. The bedrooms are fully equipped and bathrooms as well. My family enjoyed hikes in the National Forrest behind the cabin. Foot note it’s a wonderful place for photos. The patio deck & fire pits are the perfect morning and evening coffee relaxation spot lol family loved chilli & s’mores with stories as we named the stars. Checking In & Out was easy with a full garage & driveway to park vehicles. Definitely visiting this cabin again. Don’t hesitate what are you waiting for!

Stayed with kids","We went to this cabin for my husband’s 70th birthday and to celebrate his retirement with the whole family. It was a surprise, he had no idea we were all gathering there for him and it went off without a hitch! Perfect place for a large gathering. Very private and quiet. Everyone had their own rooms, the kitchen and dining were large as well as the living room. We enjoyed the outside fire pit and had drinks in the cool air on the patio each evening. The beautiful tall Christmas tree with sparkling lights on the tree as well as the bannister added to the festivities 🥳 and we took hikes down the trail to a pretty creek nearby. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and anytime we had a question for Rob, he responded quickly, which I appreciated. We will definitely stay here again! Thank you, Rob!"

Group trip","This was the most amazing vacation get away for my family and I. This was the best Airbnb that I have stayed. My family and I loved everything about this cabin. There is a little creek in the back, which you take a little walk to get to and it was perfect doing this in the morning with some coffee. In the backyard of the cabin there was a swing where you can lay down and just take a deep breath and look at the clouds and trees. Another fun item of this cabin was the trampoline which was fun for the kids. There is also a game room area where my family and I pretty much spend a lot of our time in. The two of our favorites was the pool table and the ping pong 🏓. The kitchen was lovely and was well stocked with mugs, utensils, pans, and pots. The front of the cabin was also relaxing and there was a swing to sit on and enjoy the weather with some coffee as well. Lastly, if you love fishing there is the Show Low Lake 5 minutes away from the cabin and we caught a fish! Another lake that was about 20 minute drive was Fools Hollow Lake, which is bigger.
Everything is near by such as Walmart, thrift stores, and restaurants. We went to Walmart to buy groceries and drinks. Rob was amazing and he replies fast for any questions that you may have. We will definitely be returning again for another relaxing vacation."

Stayed a few nights","Family-focused cabin/house near Show Low Lake. It has more the feel of renting a friend’s cabin than a polished AirBnB. The space would be great for kids, and could accommodate a large group easily. Be advised that there are no coffee mugs, glassware or wine glasses in the cabin, just plastic cups. While the cabin backs up to the wilderness, it is not in a remote area but more of a neighborhood, so you do deal with your typical neighborhood noises (dogs, power tools, etc). The owner is very accommodating and communicates very well. Be mindful of Ring cameras around the property, not sure if they are active while renters are there but they are present in all outdoor spaces."

Stayed with kids",Our family of 14 had a great time at this home. Such a short drive to the lake to fish. We enjoyed the crawdad fishing in the creek and the younger kids lived on the hammock swing in the back yard. Next time we will bring a truck to transport the kayaks but we were more into relaxing this trip. We loved the fire pit and enjoyed making s’mores that the homeowner left for us. Maybe a note that the house lacked noise buffering so hard for some to sleep in when there are people awake early and talking. Otherwise perfect weather and a great quiet neighborhood. You really do get to enjoy the pine trees and feel like you’re secluded yet there’s a Walmart just minutes away if you need something. The house has everything you need with plenty of towels (except washcloths so pack your own) our family is looking forward to returning.

The cabin was very clean and in the perfect location. Backed to the forest with a creek in walking distance, a swing, fire pit and trampoline. The kids had a blast outside and the adults has space to relax and enjoy the fresh air on the patio. Definitely making returning to this cabin a yearly thing for our family!"

Stayed with kids","This was one of the best cabin stays we've ever had! The location is unbeatable -- it backs up to the national forest, so you walk out the back door and you're in the woods. A 1500m walk and you're at the river. Or, if the lake is more your speed, it's literally a 2 minute drive away. My kids had a BLAST playing in the playroom and swinging on the swing. For me, waking up in the cool mountain air and sitting with my coffee in front of the big beautiful windows with the smells and stillness of the mountains washing over me was the absolute highlight. We'll definitely be back again!"

Stayed with kids","This cabin is in the most ideal location! The National Forest is right in the backyard, so it’s a quick walk to the creek where you can fish for craw dads. It’s also only a two minute drive to the lake where we went kayaking and paddle boarding. The house is well equipped with everything you need and plenty of clean towels and sheets and tons of beds! The kids had so much fun in the awesome game room too. You feel like you’re in the middle of the National Forest but you still have access to any necessary stores or restaurants. And there’s trash service which is a huge plus! We’ve stayed at cabins without trash service and it gets stinky! The hosts were overly accommodating and helpful in making sure we had the most enjoyable time!"

Stayed with kids","This cabin was the perfect getaway for our family of 6! We were so impressed with the cleanliness and loved the amazing smell of fresh air. A few of our favorite highlights: The game room was a huge hit, our kids never wanted to stop playing. All of the beds were so comfortable and clean. We really enjoyed eating dinner outside on the patio and exploring the forest right behind the cabin. There is a cute little fort in the woods a few steps behind the cabin our kids loved. A quarter mile behind the cabin is a picturesque creek where we had a riot catching crawdads. We also had a great time taking the provided paddle board and kayaks to the lake which is about 1/2 mile away. We have rented quite a few places throughout the country and this was by far our best experience, from the cleanliness, the layout of the house, room to spread out and activities in the surrounding area. We definitely hope to make a trip to this cabin a yearly tradition!"
