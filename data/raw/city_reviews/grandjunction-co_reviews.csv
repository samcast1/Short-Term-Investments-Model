Stayed with a pet",Wonderful home for me and my dog! The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the incredible smell! Ahh it was so nice. The fenced in patio is a great spot to have a cup of coffee. The front yard was more than big enough for my dog to roam around. The mattress is incredible! I slept so well! Kitchen was pristine. Plenty of cookware. We really enjoyed our stay! They even recommended a great spot to go look at wild mustangs! Would love to stay here next time I’m in grand junction. Thank you Chance and Katelyn for a lovely stay!

This location is a quiet and peaceful place to relax in the evenings which was very nice.

The view from the yard alone is worth every penny!

Stayed with a pet","For the most part it is very nice and clean with lots of room. Only a few things that I see, that could improve things. The new loft still had styrofoam/ plastic left in the new oven in the kitchen. So it much just got put in a few days ago. The kitchen is beautiful, but there was no appliances, skillets, no plates or anything to make food for our family ? Just a few glasses and forks, knives & spoons. There was someones McDonald's food that was Left in the bottom of the freezer of the refrigerator too ? Bathroom was very nice and a huge walk-in shower! Just beautiful! Also the living room area which is huge only has a medium size sofa when no other chairs or recliners in it ? So when my Son & his girlfriend visited to watch some Television, we all had to sit together tightly on the couch, so it wasn't particularly comfortable? The Grandmother that was there when we arrived only Saturday morning was so very nice and helpful! A charming woman! This is the quietist Air B & B ever."

Stephen and Mai were incredible hosts. They responded in minutes, greeted us when we arrived, and wished us well when we left.
We can't wait to stay here again! Highly recommend."

The sofa-sleeper was not functional, however, so we simply removed the mattress, and one of us slept on the floor... not a problem, but hopefully, the issue has been addressed. If not, it should be listed as a Queen bed accommodation. Linda was responsive immediately, so kudos to you, Linda, and thank you for trying to remedy the issue!"

Stayed one night","Cute, cozy and the host was really welcoming and friendly. Side note: there’s a „hatch“ between the bedroom and the living room (so it’s basically one big, connected room) which we felt was a cool design choice since there is a wooden installation/frame which still gives you a bit of „space“. Bed and couch were cozy - we would definitely stay here again! :)"

She greeted us when we arrived somewhat late and gave clear instructions. She also gave some awesome recommendations for sights to check out in the area. You'd be foolish to stay somewhere else if this listing is open.

Studio is just as described and felt very comfortable, and Linda is so friendly! Recommended if you’re looking for chill digs in Grand Junction."

Linda allowed our son to play with her dog, and when we ordered pizza delivery, gave them specific instructions to deliver it to the carriage house and they didn’t, she personally delivered it to our front door with a smile on her face.

Stayed with kids","First, I want to say it was a beautiful little studio, and it was kept clean but being questioned about my service dogs and being told that one of my dogs is “unable” to be a service animal ruined the entire experience. As soon as I got down from my car with my pregnant wife and son, after a 12 hour drive, I was immediately met with rude comments about my 2 service dogs (An Australian Shepard & a Pug). As a disabled veteran I need both my pups with me at all times. I was so exhausted from that drive and honestly confused at what she was saying but telling me which dogs are allowed to be service animals was extremely rude and slightly offensive. My dogs are both extremely intelligent, trained and make no noise. Per Airbnb policy she was only allowed to ask what service they provide, but discrediting one of my dogs status as a service animal due to their breed was enough to make my wife and I uncomfortable."

It was exactly what my little family of four needed. The only issue was the neighborhood dogs barking a ton, but that was not the fault of Linda!! It may not be good for folks that sleep very light like I do because the barking woke me up early every morning. Otherwise, Linda was very sweet and Linda’s Place was beautiful and peaceful!! Highly recommend!"

We requested a late check in - which Linda said was no problem, and checked what ages of children she allowed. Linda quickly responded with answers to all the questions we had. On the evening we were meant to arrive, there was a mud slide near Vail which shut the I70 down and made us even later! Linda was soo kind and flexible - nothing phased her! She graciously sent me some great instructions and details about the casita and we found it no problem. It was easy to access - even though it was late and dark, was lovely and clean as well as artistically decorated. We only spent the night and left early the next morning, but it was a just what we needed ! We will certainly be back again and plan on spending some more time exploring the backyard! Thank you Linda !!"

Heidi has also decorated the house with local art, including her own pieces, which was a special and interesting touch! We enjoyed the spacious open kitchen/dining/living area and backyard, as we were traveling with our three kids so it was great for them to have a lot of space to play. Heidi was friendly and communicative and check-in and check out were simple and well described. I would highly recommend this house to anyone!"

We were so comfortable here that we wished we could stay longer. The home is pristinely clean with beautiful Western boho style artistic decor. The layout was perfect for our family! The backyard area is a lovely place to spend time and the fun print on the pavers, macrame swing chairs, and lighting on the patio really added to the fun comfortable vibe. The couch is the most comfortable piece of furniture that I’ve ever sat on. We appreciated the helpful directions that helped us find the home and Heidi was quick to respond to our correspondence. The double head shower in the primary bedroom was dreamy! We are househunting back home and I’m tempted to bring a blueprint of this home because it was the perfect fit for our traveling family! 😊 Thanks for everything!"

The artwork, furniture and design give it a relaxed and impeccably clean feel and the entire property has extremely good energy. Sipping tea in the outdoor swing was a great way to start the day. I truly felt like I was in a resort. It totally exceeded my expectations.
We were two couples just passing through Grand Junction, but It would also be great for a whole family to use this house as a home base while exploring the Grand Junction area. The kitchen is a fabulous place to cook a meal, but there are many great restaurants in town. Taco Party was especially delicious! This is truly one of the best air bnb experiences I’ve had."

The loft is spacious, but has no privacy whatsoever when it comes to the people traveling with you. It's hard to tell from the pictures, but the walls separating the bathroom from the bedroom/living area are just partial walls. And the door to the toilet is slotted, so you can hear Everything that everyone is doing in the entire loft. The bed was also very uncomfortable, but my husband and I are used to a super soft bed. This bed is probably fine for those who like a little more firmness.
The owner communicated everything clearly and promptly."

The jacuzzi was amazing after a long day of hiking. The bed was fine but I wish it had a headboard and some firmer pillows (I’m a side-sleeper), but that’s just nitpicking . Place is just as described and shown in the photos, and in a quiet neighborhood. Note that you’ll need to climb a flight of exterior stairs to enter the apt as it’s on the 2nd floor of their home."

Stayed one night","Loved the funky architecture! Everything was tidy and pleasant. Really enjoyed the Asian decor. Easy to check in and out. Good restaurants nearby. The entire place was open, so if you need privacy from others in your party, this may not work so well. If you enjoy openness, however, this is the place to be!"

If I have the chance to come back to Grand Junction for work or fun, I will 100% try to stay here first. Couldn't be more grateful for this space and hosts!"

Stayed one night","Honestly this is what AirBnb is supposed to be, lovely people opening their homes up for you to come stay in. Everything felt personal, the hot tub was magic and the location in Grand Junction was nice and central but not on a busy street. All too often you find AirBnb is full of professionally organized guest houses that really have little to no personality, this place is one of the originals, where the idea for AirBnb originated. Yes it's got the quirks that come with that but the value for money is hard to deny. Will 100% stay here again."

Stayed one night","This backyard loft is cozy and well prepared. Pamela was prompt in sending check-in/entry instructions. The loft was clean, smelled lovely, had multiple beds, a great bathroom with a large shower to accompany the 2 person jacuzzi bathtub. In addition, the loft had just about everything you could need for commodities and amenities: hygiene products. Coffee, shampoo, conditioner, tea, etc.
Overall I thought this location was well worth the asking price, exceeding the quality of most local hotels and offering a balcony as well. The only minor downside was that the balcony is in the backyard and overlooks a bit of well used space by the owner's family, the view mostly being tools, work in progress, etc. But this was not a drawback for me at all, the interior is wonderful and I am happy to write this review encouraging others to give this spot a try if you're visiting GJ or need a staycation. Located close to downtown to enjoy the bar scene when the warmer weather is in swing."

The tea cart/light kitchen is as advertised - small fridge for leftovers, snacks and a few drinks, nice selection of coffee and tea, Keurig, toaster, microwave. It is not set up for cooking meals - which the Host specifically says in the property description. I'm repeating that in my review, because I missed that when we booked. It was not an issue because we were there for a long weekend and the set up is plenty for a light breakfast of yogurt/fruit/toast or to make a sandwich for a hike. The host graciously has a tub for dirty dishes and takes them to be washed. We enjoyed the short walk to the many downtown restaurants. We recommend making reservations before you arrive for your first night's dinner. It's in a quiet neighborhood and has many personal touches to make it feel comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","One of the best Air bnb’s we’ve ever stayed at . It had everything and more .
Location fantastic in a safe pretty neighbourhood a short walk to the historic town centre with shops, restaurants, greenery. A very short drive to a golf course .
Wonderfully decorated , cute spaces and all the amenities . The second sunlit floor porch with barbecue a great place to sit . I loved the layout with Cozy bed ,sitting area, large bathroom with jacuzzi and separate shower and toilet . The kitchenette dining area cute and practical . I loved the different lighting and whimsical decorating with notes to help yourself to treats, bath products etc . Exceptionally clean . You never have to leave it . We were a couple but this place could easily accommodate a small family with the daybed and toddler bed .
Can’t wait to return and stay longer"

Stayed over a week","Pamela and John were absolutely amazing hosts, who went above and beyond with every aspect of hosting!! We very much enjoyed our 19-day stay at their lovely, relaxing and extremely well-stocked place, thanks to their incredible kindness, generosity and unparalleled hospitality.
Pamela and John were so friendly and considerate, checking in via messages to see if we needed anything, and so nice to chat with in person whenever our paths crossed. They generously gave us welcome gifts of chocolates, plus special ""reverse osmosis"" filtered water and even gave us fresh zucchini muffins before we left! They provided so many wonderful, practical and thoughtful extras throughout the house, with the kitchenette including a jar of delicious biscotti, a large variety of coffee K cups and herbal teas, creamers, bottled water, instant oats and popcorn in the kitchen. There were even more fantastic extras in the bathroom, with a range of at least six bath salts available for the jacuzzi -- the star of the bathroom, complete with mood lighting! -- and a big selection of body washes, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, moisturizers and a wide range of useful toiletries.
The suite was very clean, spacious, airy and light; well designed with a circular layout; and charmingly furnished with Japanese themed decorations, plus pretty lights, quaint knick-knacks and colorful paintings and prints. It was very conveniently located, close to Main Street and all its shops and restaurants.
The kitchenette was compact but well stocked and very easy to use, with coffee maker, mini fridge, microwave, toaster, knife set and a full range of plates, bowls, mugs, cups, glasses, paper cups and plastic utensils. Pamela and John were so kind as to provide a container for dirty dishes, which they offered to wash if needed, and supply refills of ""reverse osmosis"" filtered water.
There were several bedding options, with a comfy queen bed, big day bed and a small child sized bed available. We enjoyed relaxing on the sofa, which could recline and had foldout foot rests, to watch TV (Samsung with Netflix and other streaming services).
The swamp cooler system and ceiling fan efficiently kept the suite cool during hot days, and the wifi was good, allowing us easily to work remotely, and strong especially near the small table in the living room.
It was very handy to have a washer and a dryer, both of which worked well, and a storage area that could be used for luggage or bikes.
The deck was a great place to sit and relax outside, with comfy seating, an umbrella providing shade and a grill.
We really appreciated that Pamela and John allowed us to use their driveway during our stay, parking their own cars off the sidewalk, just another sign of their generosity. We're so glad to have been able to stay at their unique, special and peaceful place. We would love to stay again if in the area and are so grateful to Pamela and John for every single wonderful thing they did to make our stay so fantastic!"

The bathroom and the Jacuzzi tub was every girls dream come true! She has so many lotions and bubble baths to choose from -she thought of everything in case you ran out too… Like Band-Aids and dental floss! I cannot recommend this place enough and if we are ever in Grand Junction again we will definitely be staying here. Also thank you guys for allowing us to plug in our electric car overnight!!

Walking distance to all kinds of shops, eating, coffee, breweries. Safe neighborhood, w great neighbors. Sienna/Trevor were great hosts and happy to share their knowledge of locals trails for cycling, hiking, off roading etc which were just a short drive away. Nice perk was lots of tv apps available, didn’t have to sign into our own accts. Home was nicely updated yet kept some of the original charm. The kitchen is beautiful w ample coffee to start your day.
Plenty of off street parking. They have a lockable shed available for a mountain bike. The welcome book is the best I have ever seen, all sorts of helpful info. We’ll definitely book again when in the area! Tk you Sienna & Trevor!"

Stayed with a pet","What a nice respite this beautiful cottage was for us! Our 'new' house in GJ was a mess of noise and dust, and we had to get away from it. We love old houses, but also a modern aesthetic and amenities and Sienna's place had it all. The vintage sense of the house was retained, but everything modernized. Gorgeous black kitchen was a pleasure to cook in. Creaky wood floors may bother some, but not us; we enjoyed them. Decor was MidMod and overall comfortable. Beds were so comfy and soft yet just firm enough for our 'old' backs. We needed a couple more towels and they responded almost instantly and dropped them off. The outside lighting and top-down shades in the living room were appreciated for safety and privacy. Black black-out shades in the bedrooms helped hugely for a daytime napper like me. Our dog loved the backyard and sniffing around all the landscaping to explore, and exercise. Bathroom functioned well. A great value also and we'll be back if we need a home-away-from-home again."

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect spot for our family to relax and unwind during our fabulous Colorado vacation. Sunny+chic has a great location— close to parks, restaurants, the Science Museum for our granddaughter, fun downtown attractions, etc. The decor is updated with lots of designer touches. The kitchen is a chef’s dream— beautiful gas range, nice cookware, with every spice you might need. (And the spices are fresh, not the 8 year old stale stuff hidden in the back of some kitchen cabinets).
Our favorite part of the house was the spacious and nicely landscaped back yard. We had a pretty wood fire every night in the fire pit and we cooked up some pretty tasty s’mores. Wonderful family time for lots of memories."

It's also a decent walk to the amphitheater and close to all the hiking in the area. The kitchen includes most everything you'd need, including a wide variety of spices. The back yard is lovely with a firepit and firewood and a grill. The yard is fully fenced, but the neighbor does have a large dog that was outside most of the time. So keep that in mind if you're bringing pets or curious small children. It wasn't a big issue for us - our border collie just paid much more attention to the dog on the other side of the fence than playing with us."

Stayed with a pet",This was a very nice/comfortable place to stay. The backyard was great for our dog to get some time off-leash. The location is fabulous for walking all around downtown and visiting the cool restaurants and shops. We luckily happened to be there during the annual Christmas float parade and it was so much fun to take the 5 min. walk down to the main street and see all the unique Christmas floats. What I really liked about the place was how it was heated. Normally I dread going into cold climates in the winter because the heaters dry out my skin so badly. This place had some very cool old-fashioned heaters that produced a nice warmth in the whole house without the dry air that the usual heaters produce. That was a very nice plus.

The open plan format of the main living space and kitchen made the place feel very spacious and bright and we loved the ""chic"" decor. Bedrooms had plenty of storage space and beds were very comfortable. Great kitchen with all the essential appliances, supplies etc. that you need. Plus, the house is in a great location, close to Main Street with shops and restaurants close by. We would definitely stay again."

I joke that it takes ten minutes to get to anywhere in Grand Junction, and that really is true with the location of the house. The backyard is a dog owner's dream. Room to run and be a dog. A few walkable parks for the pups. Check in and out were very smooth. I really appreciated the hosts acknowledge the cleaning fee exists and really do not ask for you to do much housekeeping on your way out. I also love that they know dogs are going to get on the bed, get on the furniture, so just put a sheet down. So refreshing."

I have been to expensive places, places with pools, and places with great views, but this one was something special. The host's kindness stood out, the interior design was beautiful, and the sauna was fantastic! Also, being able to feed the horses nearby was a highlight, especially for our 2-year-old who loves animals. The open view was incredible, and two adult men slept comfortably on the two sofa beds without any complaints. There were not many blackout drapes and there were a lot of windows, so the sunlight came in early and woke the men up, which meant I did not have to wake them up myself. This was the best Airbnb during our trip. The welcome gift was also amazing! We will definitely come back."

Stayed with kids","Keith and Marnie's place is wonderful! My small family of 3 spent Thanksgiving there. The weather didn't cooperate with our plans to mountain bike (although we did get some biking in on Thanksgiving morning - I highly recommend Fruita for some awesome trails!!). But despite the cold, snowy weather, there was plenty to do inside with games, streaming, the dry sauna, and venturing outside to pet Roxy and Roscoe (the best horses ever!). We also did a day trip to Moab for some shopping and sightseeing. The house itself is cozy and inviting. The kitchen is well equipped and the farm fresh eggs, mandarins and local IPA were a special touch. Marnie was wonderful when we arrived, showing us around and introducing us to the animals. She made us feel right at home. Such a warm and welcoming home and host. Thank you for a wonderful stay, and we will come back when it's warmer to truly enjoy the trails."

Stayed one night","Run, don't walk, to schedule your reservation at this perfect little gem. The location is just as described, and although you are on a shared property (with what I imagine is the owner) you have total seclusion and privacy the whole time. The renovation on this barn is modern, thoughtful, and perfectly clean. Plus, at every turn you encounter tiny little touches like a kitchen with extra appliances/condiments/treats, a bathroom with dispensers for all the self care products you would need. Access and directions were easy and clear. The barrel sauna was such a wonderful way to start the day on our way out of town. One of the cooler places we've stayed at, this property really encapsulates what can be so unique and wonderful about Air B&Bs when done right."

It has wonderful views of the mountains, and the back patio is very private with lots of wild flowers and birds to watch. We found a couple of welcoming beverages in the fridge along with a lovely card, that was such a nice touch and made us feel welcome and appreciated. WiFi was very spotty, but since we did not need to work during our stay, it was not an issue and encouraged us to find other forms of entertainment, including some board games that we found in one of the kitchen drawers. Overall, we had a great time."

The exterior of their home is equipped with everything you need to star gaze, connect with nature, or relax.
The interior of the home has so much style and great features, so one of the days we stayed inside and enjoyed the space. Remember you are amongst nature, so we did encounter lots of crickets which if they get inside it’s rough because the house is so quiet it can disrupt your sleep ( They are loud) We made sure to keep the doors shut when not entering or exiting, but they somehow managed to get in.
We would definitely stay again!!"

Stayed with kids","I would be shocked if this place ever gets less than 5 stars. As a fellow host, I was impressed and motivated to make our place better after staying here. The place is perfect. It feels new and modern while also feeling warm and homey at the same time. Our family of four (two small kids) had no problem sharing the space (we brought a blow up mattress for our kids but they would've been fine in the main living area) and we regretted that we were only there for one night. There was something for everyone here. From the private space to the animals to the amazing scenery, we were all blown away. The outdoor shower and sauna were lovely perks and the place just kept giving more surprises, like feeding the horses, hammocks, fresh eggs from the chickens, and a fire pit. The bed was comfortable, kitchen fully stocked, fireplace functional, and tons of natural light. On top of that, Marnie was quick to respond to messages and a joy to communicate with. We would love to come back."

They put up a Christmas tree for while we spent the holidays there and they left little goodies for us.
On the property too they have farm animals which was such a delight for us and being able to interact with them! We received farm fresh eggs from the chickens. Talk about perks!
Waking up in the mornings was truly peaceful and the evenings were equally as great with the ability to see the stars. I could go on and on about how great this place is. Definitely recommend staying here for a one of a kind experience! Would definitely stay again."

There are so many small details all over the house that just make you really appreciate the time and effort they put into it. You’re close enough to some really good restaurants, and mountains that are just breathtaking. I really hope to visit again I can’t say enough good things about the place and the people that run it.

The only reason it was not a 5 star stay is because the hot tub was filthy. We chose this rental over another that was closer to our in-town friends, FOR the hot tub, and it looked like it was full of lake water, algae and all. I reached out about cleaning it, and we received a response telling us where chemicals were stored that we could use. We did that, however it didn’t help clear the water. In future, I will double check that an amenity like that is actually clean and functioning.
All in all, we really enjoyed our stay."

It’s not too big and the basement space worked great for us. We walked to the main commercial area where there is lots going on in this up and coming town. It’s really close to Colorado National Monument with its distinct color and rock formations, so if you do one thing while visiting, the monument is it. Would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Family of 6 visiting over 4th of July - what a great location! Central to most everything, walkable to old Main, restaurants, etc. Everything was as advertised - including the bikes and hot tub. Kevin and his co-host sent recommendations that were very helpful, they were both quick to respond to messages. Twin beds are in the basement which worked out great having 2 teenagers with us that could have their own bathroom and space away.
We had an issue with the AC for 1 day where the house was hot overnight. Kevin had a repair man out the same night and again the next day to resolve the issue - even on the holiday. We recognize this wasn’t anyone’s fault - just unfortunate timing.
Our only complaints are minor - no coffee/tea supplied so bring your own, and no curtains in the bedrooms - with sunset being at 9:30pm and sunrise before 6am, our kids had a hard time getting to sleep and then woke up super early. That may be personal preference - we prefer curtains to block the light."

Room for us all to spread out and really enjoy the space! The front porch was a favorite spot but so was the amazing backyard that included a grill, a hot tub, and even a one of a kind special COlorado Bike inspired art piece! Additionally, having 6 bikes and access to a 2 car garage was above and beyond. The location was amazing with it’s walkability or scooter - ability 🛴 if you so choose! Lots to do downtown and in the surrounding area. The proximity to CMU campus is great too. The neighborhood was quaint and quiet. Kevin and his business partner were responsive and attentive when the need arose. Even his landscaper was great and asked if it was to early to start mowing! We will definitely recommend staying with them and look forward to staying again in the future!"

Stayed with kids",Beautifully renovated home with unique touches. We found the photos of the home before the updates and were in love with the parts of the house the owners kept. The floor plan was ideal for us. Two large bedrooms on the main floor opposite of each other (great for privacy/noise as we had an infant) and a large bedroom in the basement that had plenty of space and light. The bathrooms was nicely done with plenty of natural light. We also made use of the laundry room. The kitchen was perfectly stocked with spices and cooking items. This home was ideal for the 6 of us traveling into town for a wedding. The backyard/hot tub was fantastic for us to relax in the evening and host a little bonfire. There was a great coffee shop (mountain air roasters) just down the road that we walked to on the nice cool mornings. Definitely one of the best Airbnbs that we’ve had the pleasure of staying at. Highly recommend.

And the master bed is completely private. The hot tub was amazing and all the finishes were top quality/not cheap. The yard was completely fenced in (shared with another property of theirs). Perfect location next to downtown. Highly recommend.

It was so beautiful decorated on top of everything else! We will absolutely be staying again! Our visit was everything we wanted and more!! Thank you Allie!!"

After a long day of baseball it was great to unwind in the hot tub and then after dinner we all would hop on the bikes and take a cruise around town. Allie’s place is super cute and has some great amenities. We loved seeing how the house had be renovated and were fans of the how she mixed in many upgrades while restoring a lot of the older features of the house! We would definitely stay here again and look forward to the next time we can make memories at 1259 Rood.

This meant that we were able to hear everything that was happening in the main house and I'm sure that meant they could hear everything in our unit. We never figured out how to work the TV...it had a firestick, but would not let us see any of the apps or let us login with our account. Other than that the stay was fine...we had an issue with the door, but it was handled immediately."

That said, it's nothing that will affect your stay negatively.

Stayed one night","A key reason I chose this place, in addition to it being highly rated, was the grassy inviting setting in airbnb photo. While I usually stay with friends when I visit Grand Junction, I had a quick one night trip I needed to make. I wanted to host friends instead of them hosting me... and have wine and snacks on the grassy ssetting In reality, there was no grass, the setting was rocks, and it was hot. In response, Lalita said they had had problems with the grass so instead had the yard 'professionally xeriscaped'. Well, there was alot of rock.There were no plants which i thought xeriscaped might include some drought tolerant plants. I also couldnt get in the door, i put in last 4 of my phone number and while I heard the 'whir' of the lock, the bolt which I could see between the doors, did not move. I tried a few times, waiting in between for the mechanism to reset ( I contacted Lalita she said push on the door) I left to visit friends.) Came back couple hours later and lock worked."

The unit itself - while it has the basics (thank you!), the layout is not utilitarian - there is a converted closet that harbors kitchen counter, hot plate, some kitchen cabinets that have your necessary utensils, etc.; for coffee snobs, there is coffee, but its Folgers packets. But the kitchen microwave, toaster oven and large sink shared with large washer/dryer is accessed through the bathroom containing a toilet and shower. The large sink must be shared as a bathroom sink. Akward, but we appreciated the other elements and that it is completely private from the main unit. The drive way was not available, sluffed from the street through the gate. Foam bed. Even so, we enjoyed and appreciated our stay."

The back patio was amazing to be at with the warmer weather. The yard is big and open with a cute little peace sign in the rocks. I loved that little feature. It was very quiet, you could not hear the other tenants in the house. Lalita was very responsive and amazing to work with! You can feel all the work and love they have put into the space. We can not wait until our next trip down there. We may even rent out the whole house!"

This is also a duplex so someone could be staying next to you. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and this is a great place."

Stayed one night","We stopped here on our way back home from a Utah road trip. This is a good value and close access to the freeway.
There was a patio with table and chairs to sit outside, and is 420 friendly. The room was very clean and directions plus access was super easy. The space was colorful, open and airy. Bed was comfortable, and the heating was nice and cozy. It was perfect for the quick overnight stay. The kitchen set up had a toaster, fridge and nice big counter space, but the sink was in a separate location, so kind of funky and a little more difficult if you actually wanted to create meals while staying here. The laundry room (where the sink was) did not have the washer and dryer available for guests; that was unfortunate as we would have liked to wash some of our things. I would choose this nice space over a motel in town and that was our mindset. Thank you for the nice, convenient stay."

My friend had some assignments to do during our stay and the table areas were a nice touch. This is a great place for two people, we fit perfectly in the bed and lounged on the couch. The Rocku TV was nice to keep us entertained at night(:
Clean space, plenty of room to get ready, eat food, and relax. the outdoor table was a must to be outside and enjoy fresh air (and smoke!)
We didn’t cook as there wasn’t a regular stove just the cook top inductor but the microwave was great for our meal choices and snacks. Some cooking spray or condiments would’ve been nice to keep in the kitchen for guests though for guests who did wanna cook and feel at home(:
Overall a great space, good price, private, close to downtown Grand Junction (which we recommend for food options) and Palisade (have to try local Peach Salsa)!
What a great weekend. Thanks for being a part of it & hosting us! Would recommend to anyone in the area."

Stayed one night",A cozy little spot! My husband stayed one night on his way through town. He was specifically excited about the little heater in the bathroom bc it made the toilet seat warm. 😂 finishing touches get an A+

Stayed with kids","Other than a user error (my fault) our stay was seamless. It was quiet and mostly what I expected. The value is great and was close to lots of places. My only criticisms would be the need for small updates and repairs, and the fact that the kitchen is in two places, and the bathroom sink is the same sink as the kitchen sink. I imagine it was too hard to add more plumbing to add another. But it didn’t negatively effect our stay at all. Water was hot, WiFi was awesome, will stay here again!"

Stayed about a week",Lalita and Chris were excellent hosts. The studio was clean and had everything we needed during our stay. There was plenty of room for 2 people to stay and we didn't feel crowded. Lalita and Chris were easy to get a hold of and quick to respond to any questions and concerns that we had.
