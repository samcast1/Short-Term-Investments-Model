Group trip","Our stay was great! The kitchen open to the main living space was perfect for staying together.. while 1 to 3 worked in the kitchen, we could stay in the conversation in the living room. Our 18mo grandchild loved the room to run & engage with us all. The roomy 8-place dining table suited us great. The furnishings were so cute and modern. The colorful pillows and throws made it very homey. We had 5 people stay overnight even tho there was a 4th empty bed. They all slept well. This home was a 10 min drive from our daughter's house so we were already familiar with the area. Close to Maple St but far enough off, we didn't hear traffic noise. Frankie was quick to respond to several messages I sent him prior to our stay about kitchen supplies and how to enter. :) The kitchen was well stocked with all the utensils & pots & pans & dinnerware that we needed. Many empty cupboards but it had everything we needed. We brought our own salt, pepper, and ketchup and other foods. Thanks Frankie!! :)"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely lovely apartment! Location is perfect if you want to explore the Old Market. My husband’s high school friend flew in for a visit and this space was a great place for them to hang out for a guys weekend. Check in and parking instructions were very clear. Kristen was super responsive and even checked in during some bad weather to make sure everyone was ok.
The only thing to note is that the sleeping space is tight for two adults not sleeping in the same space. The bedroom is great, plenty of room, but the other sleeping space is pretty tight for an adult. Would be perfect for a kids sleeping space. I read the same comment in other reviews but I didn’t catch that until after the visit. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","For a girls weekend in Omaha for a concert, this apartment was exactly what we needed. It was in a safe area with lots of options for food, art galleries and local boutiques. We loved having the parking garage and only used the car once as everything we needed was in easy walking distance. The apartment was well appointed and comfortable. My only heads up would be for those sleeping in the twin beds in the loft area...low clearance. I am 5ft 7in and I couldn't stand upright. No issue for us as we literally were only up there to sleep but wanted to mention in case a whole group of tall people were staying :) Would definitely stay here again and have recommended to a couple of friends! Great weekend with a lovely place to stay!"

Group trip","Kristen was wonderful to work with and was committed to ensuring our stay/weekend was good. There was a cleaning snafu prior to our arrival but Kristen responded immediately and made things right. The space itself is clean and well appointed. The location was perfect for our event at CHI Health center and parking garage next door convenient. Appreciated the breakfast and later checkout. One thing to know however is the room is advertised as sleeping up to 8, but there are only beds for 4 (2 twins, 1 queen); air mattresses, futon/pull out couch is needed to sleep 8 and we didn't realize this before. Space is very cramped with more than 4/5 adults."

Stayed a few nights","We traveled from Memphis to Omaha for a family reunion/picnic. Since I needed to cook food for the event, I decided to do it in the condo instead of bringing it from home. Kristen had plenty of pots and pans, and we picked up ingredients at a nearby grocery store. She even had several spices and seasonings. The condo was perfect for my husband, me and our 26-year-old son. We had plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable. The location is within walking distance of plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping. We loved exploring the nearby park area with the slides and swings. We drove to Council Bluffs twice to enjoy ice cream from Christy Cream. Yum! We were fortunate to enjoy a baseball game at Schwab Stadium. Also, we liked having parking privileges at the attached garage. We felt safe, and our car stayed nice and cool. Plus, it was so convenient when bringing in our groceries. The next time we're in Omaha, we'll definitely book this condo again!"

With just 2 of us, we had more than enough room. The floor plan is very open, no part of the space is completely closed off other than the washroom, so noise does carry - which was not a problem for us, but worth knowing. Great location in Omaha's Old Market - convenient for shopping, dining, and getting into and out of town. Definitely recommended!"

My husband, sister, and I (all busy professionals) wanted to coordinate a trip to attend our niece's graduation from Creighton, and Dan's property stood out as a perfect home base. From booking to checkout, every detail of our experience was convenient, thoughtful, and timely. We had considered booking a hotel suite but wanted to make the most of our short time together. Dan's place was cozy, thoughtfully designed, and perfectly suited for hangouts over coffee, meeting family in town during the day, and evening re-cap sessions. Every trip is unique, of course, but if you're a couple or small group, Dan's Blue Oasis could be an ideal home away from home in Omaha for you too."

The location is great. Easy to get to. Easy to drop off/pick up with Uber and walking distance to a large grocery store."

Stayed one night","Good location in Omaha, very quiet and actually larger than a “tiny house”. Good use of the space and don’t be afraid, the bed upstairs is not an air mattress. My only complaint? For the price I paid, I would hope to have a shower curtain liner that isn’t discolored, gross and old. Other than that, everything was good! I would still recommend, but I would also recommend for the host to buy a new liner from the store. They’re less than $10!"

Stayed with kids","My family would stay in this home again. Overall it is well kept, the neighborhood is nice, and it is very close to the zoo and other attractions. We felt safe in the neighborhood and the off-street parking was nice. The owner communicates well and quickly. Now - I am an overly critical person, but here are the things that I noticed:
1. The main problem was the cleanliness of the floor. It is a very nice LVT floor and was swept well but left a black film on our feet and socks. This isn't the first place I have stayed in with that issue for the floors. These are great floors you just have to pay attention to cleaning in a different way. I messaged the owner and he promptly replied and offered to drop off a Swiffer and cleaning pads that evening and to have the cleaning crew stop by the next morning while we were at the zoo.
2. The mini-split heat system doesn't seem to keep up with even the small size of the residence. The back bedroom and front area stay pretty cold. There is a baseboard heater mounted to the ceiling in the bedroom, but it got the ceiling so hot it made my wife nervous and we turned it off. It didn't really help anyway. Note: it was 29-30 degrees overnight so it was on the chilly side.
3. Be careful with the baseboard heater near the toilet, it gets hot and you could be surprised touching your leg to it when using the restroom.
4. The spiral staircase is really neat. There is some loose hardware that needs attention. The owner mentioned he would attend to it prior to the next tenant.
5. The floor pan in the shower is a little soft and has a crack in it.
6. The ceiling fan has an ""Oscillate"" switch. Don't switch it on as the fan is zip tied in place.
The washer and dryer are really nice as are the cabinets and other appliances. Paint and drywall was in excellent condition and the kids really enjoyed the loft which has a nice, sturdy, safe railing. The electronic locks were nice and in good shape and as I said the neighborhood and the exterior of the home are in nice shape.
I know the review sounds harsh, but I like to point out things that I would like to know. Overall the place is in nice shape. This air BNB is still better than probably any local hotel room and up there with many other places I have rented. Each place always has quirks and this owner seemed very attentive to needs and making sure things were cleaned/repaired. As I said to him, many times you don't know something is wrong or needing fixed unless/until someone tells you.
Don't be afraid to rent from this owner. We will look this place back up next time we take the kids to the zoo."

Remember that the loft is a loft, so standing up up there isn't really a thing if you're tall. However, it's cozy for reading a few pages before turning in, and a good sleep. We didn't use the kitchen much, but it was laid out well and appeared to be well equipped. We'll keep it in mind for future trips through town. 👍"

The spiral stairs make for an easy climb to bed (much better than many locations with ladders). The kitchen is surprisingly spacious if you're doing any kind of cooking. The showerhead is the ceiling so you've got plenty of room in the shower. All controls for lights, fans, AC are all intuitively located. That hammock was a great place to kick back at the end of the day. I will absolutely come back to Reuben's place the next time I'm in Omaha. It has to be one of the very best deals in town for an overnight stay with all the amenities you'd ever need and then some."

Stayed one night",Such a pleasant quick visit for me. Flight arrived late and needed a quiet place to rest. This was perfect. Everything was tidy and nice. Only feedback I have to make it even better would be to work on the bathroom door a little. I felt so badly opening the door as it stuck a little bit since it’s old. I was worried I was disturbing the bedroom adjacent to it. Thanks for a great stay!

Stayed with a pet","What a wonderful week we had at Kat’s place. The entire home was exactly what we were expecting and her excellent communication and kindness were an added touch.
The location was a short walk to the Old Market and great bars and restaurants. The neighborhood was quiet and had a pride of ownership at the homes next door and across the street!
The home was very clean. The linens were abundant. The optional beverages was a treat. The backyard was a lovely and comfortable space and quite large. Ohhh that primary bathroom and closet were so very perfect! The kitchen was adjacent to the living space and made the open concept so nice for family. The extra high ceilings were an architectural bonus. The beds were very nice and the bathrooms were amazing!
But the highlights were definitely the rooftop patio and the creative decor and artwork that adorned so many walls. It was a boutique hotel environment that we loved.
We will be back each and every time I visit Omaha with my family!"

Stayed a few nights","If you get a chance to stay here you must! You feel like you are in a boutique hotel. Everything you’d need is there so you’d never have to leave but you’re a short walk from Little Bohemia (cute and good food). Old Market is a walk or quick 5 minute Uber. The rooms were the perfect size, had great amenities and the primary bathroom should be in a magazine felt very private. Impeccably clean including the yard and rooftop. If you run out of drinks they have some there for purchase. I can go on. It’s worth the money."

And there were so many lovely plants—it did feel like being in a little jungle even on a very cold Omaha stay. There was helpful signage just where we needed it, and a lovely stocked bar we didn’t use but appreciated just the same. Showers were hot, beds were comfy, and linens were clean. The location is great—near the main drag and terrific restaurants in Benson but dark and quiet for a good night’s sleep. Hosts were helpful and quick to respond to the lone question we had. Would stay here again for sure."

Stayed a few nights","Brandon was such a caring and responsive host! He thought of everything, down to a fully stocked bar from which you can buy bottles of wine, botanical gin, club soda. There are many wonderful bars within walking distance (including one that sells wholesale liquor), but sometimes you just want to veg out. The record player would have been awesome (it's an antique and wasn't currently operating) but even just looking through the records was fun (anybody who has a Fleet Foxes record is good people). The beds were super comfy, the kitchen was clean and pretty. I hadn't even noticed in the pictures all the plants (hence, ""Jungle-O Bungalow) but they were so beautiful. The bathroom vanity is a gorgeous deep green, the tile work was so pretty. The front porch seems like it would be a lot of fun in the summer months! I'm from Omaha, but had a friend visiting from out of town, and we both LOVED it. Not only was the house awesome but it's a ten minute walk to Benson! Brandon rocks"

I would definitely stay again :)

Brandon has gone out of his way to make his guests feel welcome and cared for by making extra amenities available to his guests that you don't find in other homes.

Stayed a few nights","The care and intention that's been put into Brandon's home in this quiet neighborhood is evident from the moment you set foot inside the inviting plant-filled porch just outside the front door. I had a much needed restful stay here during an extremely stressful period while I was in the process of moving between homes. Comfortable bedding, chic furnishings, a well-stocked kitchen, private driveway, and plenty of thoughtfully offered extra toiletries should you need something that you may have forgotten. Clear and friendly instructions and notes are posted in various spots around the house to help guide you. This is far more than merely a place to stay and a bed. Brandon has thought of so many extra touches and details that a traveler might find of use, and his sense of decor and love of plants makes the space feel so calming. I would highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting Omaha that wants peace and quiet while still centrally located in the city."

It was perfect. Beyond perfect. Brandon has all the little touches through the home that make for a comfortable, restful, and homey stay. From the cocktail cabinet (which I didn’t partake in, but I think is brilliant), to the toiletries, to the simple but clear instructions for check-out…everything’s been thought of. And so clean! I have a simple scale of, “am I comfortable taking a shower here?”. Needless to say, it was clean enough to shower. And the caulking around the tub is bright white - we all know that takes commitment.
The neighborhood was so quiet at night. But also very close to restaurants.
I can’t recommend this property enough."

Bonus, there are lots of local & yummy eats nearby. We recommend an ice from Coneflower Creamery. Next time we visit Omaha we are definitely booking the jungle bungalow."

We also used the location to shoot some promotional videos, since the lighting was so fantastic (in the sunroom especially). That particular room is definitely a highlight for warmer month stays. We both really enjoyed all the beautiful plants and art, too. Everything was clearly marked and easy to find. The small backyard was perfect to walk out into as I sipped my morning coffee. The bar area was cute and very well-stocked! It was a very thoughtful and well-designed space to relax in.

We certainly felt at home and comfortable. The bed are cozy, slept great. The kitchen is quite functional, had everything we needed to prepare meals. The overall vibe here was calm, chill, and relaxed. The plants were incredibly inspirational! Just a beautiful bonus to this home. Decor is crisp and clean. Brandon had back up bathroom/medicine cabinet supplies if needed. He had an option to purchase booze if you wanted. Great human. Neighborhood felt safe. Perfect spot for my husband, one year old, and myself to call home for a few days. We will definitely stay here again this summer when we plan another trip with family."

They really thought of everything in! The beds were comfy and the plants were beautiful all around. I wish the weather would have been warmer so we could have enjoyed the cozy sun porch! Even though we didn’t use it, I appreciated the mini bar options as well.
We’re already planning our trip again for next year!"

the kitchen was well stocked with just about everything you would need to cook any kind of meal. The beds were very comfortable and they living area was great for TV watching and visiting.
We will definitely be returning to this home in the future :-)"

Stayed one night","An amazing home in a great neighborhood! We had a wonderful stay at Brandon's beautifully decorated and comfortable home. We were able to find the house very easily and park in the driveway without difficulty. There were a few steps to get into the covered porch and the check in process was simple and easy. Brandon has a very helpful remote that turns on all the lights for you when you walk in and we were greeted with a beautiful living room and lots of beautiful plants. The bedrooms were both very cute and we appreciated the extra lock on the door for extra peace of mind. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets were soft and the room was quiet. The bathroom was pristine and Brandon had very kindly left some supplies for travelers who might have forgotten something (tooth paste, tylenol, toothbrushes, tampons) which was so sweet and thoughtful! We did not use the kitchen much but there was a brita filter in the fridge and plenty of dishware. We wish we could have stayed longer!"

He also put together the most thoughtful pocket hanger of individually wrapped medicines and toiletries in case you found yourself in need of: ibuprofen (which I did), antacids, cough drops, toothbrushes, toothpaste, tampons and many more things you may find yourself in need of but didn’t think to bring. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again when in Omaha."

the shower was awesome, and pretty advanced with a little screen showing the temp of the water, but could not turn on the body jets simultaneously.
The toilet was very fancy, so was the sink, but would splash at full pressure.
The pillow were our least favorite part. Very firm and puffy, felt kind of like a hard balloon, Neck was sore the next few days. Overall a nice stay. But a little pricey after fees"

Stayed one night","Positive things first: the apartment is just as cute and cozy as described in the listing. The host explained check-in procedures clearly and accurately. While the immediately adjacent neighborhood is just ok, you’re only a mile away from Aksarben and all its restaurants and bars. And the basement had heated floors, which was a nice perk.
Unfortunately, a few bad points really drug down our stay. We were really looking forward to using the hot tub, it was a 50° night, so perfect weather. But when we arrived, the tub was set to 80° and didn’t get above about 90° before we went to bed. And since this is a basement studio apartment, there’s a different AirB&B rental above you, which was occupied during our stay. The guests above us weren’t terribly obnoxious, but we could hear every footstep and conversation and joke. And they got up to leave at 5:30am, quite loudly. We likely won’t be staying here again."

There was enough towels! Everything was so clean. The hot tub was wonderful! One of the Jets need to work a little harder than the other one but that’s alright!

The beds are comfortable, the kitchen was stocked well enough for us to prep meals, and the space worked fine for our group of 5. It is an older home with steep steps going upstairs or downstairs, so something to be aware of for elderly or small children, but there are two bedrooms on the main floor so you don't have to go upstairs or downstairs if you don't want to."

The A/C unit in the upper level was extremely loud and located right by the head of the beds. We ended up turning it off at night and luckily the weather was mild for us.
I brought k-cups with me, but the coffee maker wasn’t actually a keurig. But you could make single servings with the ground coffee provided, and it wasn’t a big deal at all.
Jessica checked in with us multiple times during our stay and was very thoughtful after some severe weather hit the area.
Would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I love older homes and neighborhoods. Jessica’s place is on a street with historic homes and close to hip restaurants in a popular district. We sat out on the back deck of the house in the evening.
The house itself had everything we needed and was nicely decorated. The main bathroom was beautifully renovated and the beds were especially comfy. We watched Hulu and prepared some meals in the kitchen. It was great being able to park in the garage.
Jessica was organized, friendly and helpful. We were able to get in as soon as the house was ready.
A couple cautions…be careful backing out onto the street as it is difficult to see cars coming. And bring mosquito spray. We would definitely stay again."

The furniture is comfortable and clean.
The kitchen was a little on the small side, but was very functionable. 2 good size cabinets for your own items. Stove and fridge were very clean and ready for use.
The beds were some of the most comfortable ones I have encountered on Air BnB. The linens and towels were soft and on the new side. The bathrooms were clean and also had plenty of storage.
The stairs were on the steep side, but that is to be expected in the age of the home.
We were there on an extremely HOT weekend, and the air conditioner kept up just fine, along with the 2 window units upstairs.
This location is with in 3-4 miles of about everything downtown, and has a nice walking neighborhood.
I would definitely recommend this home and would book again when in the area."

Stayed with kids","We stayed at this listing as a good halfway point between our extended family members for a brief visit. I think this is definitely one of the most affordable airbnb houses I’ve stayed at in some time, but that didn’t sacrifice the value. The weather was a little too hot to make our dinner excursions walkable, but I thought the location was pretty great minus a cranky neighbor who made it clear more than once that our presence wasn’t welcome, but that’s no fault of the owner. Jessica was very responsive, and we really appreciated the amenities she provided. It was easy for someone to retreat upstairs or in the basement for extra quiet and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful as well. We were surprised how fast the window AC unit upstairs cooled that portion of the house (everything else was centra AC.) The kitchen is stocked with everything we needed to care for two small kids, and we appreciated the Starbucks coffee in the morning! We would stay here again."

Main floor bathroom is a little cramped. The basement bedroom has a nice ample bathroom. Overall, it is a nice house and well furnished and supplied.

The house itself was excellent, and the layout was lovely. Our kids got a kick out of the attic and the basement (very few basements where we live in AZ). We appreciated all of the little touches that were provided and would be happy to stay again on our next visit.
My only suggestion would be to put a little table and maybe a couple of chairs on the front porch so people can enjoy coffee, wine, etc. in the front area if they would like to."

The large dining table was also nice to enjoy meals and conversation. Beds were super comfy and the two bathrooms worked well for our group.

Stayed a few nights",Great experience. The space was lovely and just as advertised. When the weather was awful and we got snowed out of our plans Jessica allowed us to check in early so we could get changed out of our wet snowy clothes and warm up. Great location and a great host.

Stayed about a week","Excellent host! Needed a place for family to stay while loved one had surgery and recovery at UNMC. Wanted room for everyone to have their own space and this house had it. Family is from town and a bit nervous being in Omaha but they felt comfortable, safe, easy access to UNMC and welcomed . It was PERFECT! Jessica was wonderful to work with, when recovery needed a few extra days to do an extension. Thank you, Jessica, for taking such good care for my family. We will stay again…juts hopefully for vacation and not medical! :)"

But they went above and beyond as there was a freak ice storm and we got stuck on a hill near the house. And Matt came to help us out when AAA refused! We were thrilled beyond measure at their hospitality and willingness to make us feel safe during our stay. HIGHLY recommend!! They deserve 1000 stars!"

Group trip","Everything was great! Jessica provided a welcome basket, card, and a very well put together binder that had recommendations of where to eat, visit, as well as other important information. My group consisted of five individuals and we all had more than enough space. The location was perfect as it is located near a main street but also nestled away to where you are away from the street noise and sound. I'll definitely stay there again if we have a big group again! Also the basement bed where I stayed was super comfortable. Also to be noted if you're a coffee drinker, Jessica supplied some Caribou and Starbucks coffee for the drip coffee maker as well as to-go cups, more than enough of a variety of creamers and flavored pump syrups. For those staying in the basement, it can be a bit chilly (as expected for a basement)but Jessica also provided a space heater that provided adequate heat for the space. As far as decor goes, just as described and depicted in the pictures!"

Everything smells amazing there and they provide extra amenities such as soaps, snacks, coffee etc. They communicated very well with me and my families needs. As well as asked if we needed anything during our stay. They provide a binder full of things you can do while you stay in Omaha with lots of recommendations. Then if you find the guest book you can read about all the other guests stays! This place is so beautiful and there’s lots of privacy even though it’s close to a main road. I highly recommend this home to anyone who wants to visit. I’ve stayed at a few air bnbs in Omaha (my family lives there) and this is the best communication I’ve ever received from a host. These two are great at what they do!"

Stayed a few nights","The little house is just as posted: cute and darling. The entry process was the easiest we've encountered. Questions were promptly answered, and the difficulties we non-tech-savvy ""elders"" faced with the entertainment system were quickly and personally solved. We appreciated the opportunity for a face to face interaction with Cindy and had an enjoyable visit with her.
One aspect that caught our attention is that two luggage racks are provided - hosts often forget that guests need a place to put their bags.
It is so quiet, it's hard to believe it's just a block off a busy street.
All in all, we had a lovely time and can attribute a good part of that to John & Cindy's superior hosting."

The place was very clean; the bed was super comfortable, and Cindy was quick to respond to any questions I had. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable. The location is very accessible and easy to travel to and from all over the city. Highly recommend and hope to return!"

Stayed with kids","John and Cindy’s cottage was great for our short weekend trip to Omaha to visit family and the zoo with our almost 3 year old. The single bedroom was just wide enough for us to fit our narrow toddler travel cot next to the bed, and we appreciated the extra space of the living room and kitchen area while traveling with our toddler. Great, cozy space for a small family or a couple. We most appreciated Cindy’s kindness and thoughtfulness - leaving lights on for a late check in, booster seat, toddler gate to block the stairs, etc. and her great and quick communication. Wouldn’t hesitate to book again or recommend to others."

Cons: Only one - the mattress is very uncomfortable. We were planning to stay 10 days, we only stayed two nights and this was after I bought my own foam topper for night 2. We then had to move to a different Airbnb. John and Cindy gave us a full refund which was very kind. However, I cannot in good faith to my fellow travelers give this place all 5 stars even though there is NOTHING else to mention. Even though the space is welcoming and comfortable, the mattress is old and frankly atrocious."

Stayed a few nights",This place is perfect for any small get away! My fiancé came up so we could do take engagement pictures and I could show her around where we will be living and it was just great for what we needed! They had a list of recommendations on where to go and we’re very kind people! I highly recommend this cozy cottage!

Stayed a few nights","My best friend Susan and I stayed at John & Cindy’s Airbnb for a quick, clean two night stay. Upon arriving we met John & Cindy on the front lawn of the Airbnb. They maintained a respectful distance due to the pandemic but also provided us a warm and friendly welcome. Prior to arriving we did maintain communication with Cindy who had continued to be a great, hospitable host throughout our stay. Overall, the Airbnb itself exceeded our expectations. From the decor, to the spacious living room, the photos do not do the Airbnb justice. It’s honestly a really beautifully decorated, cozy, clean stay. Plus, the hosts are extremely kind, considerate, and hospitable. I even left my jean jacked and Cindy contacted me to assist me with getting the jacket back to me. This Airbnb truly goes above and beyond expectations and I would definitely recommended anyone coming to Omaha to stay here for an overall wonderful experience."

Stayed with kids",This was my second time booking one of Johnny’s houses and it was exactly as described. We brought our three young kids to Omaha for an extended weekend. Location was central to all things! It was nice to have the pool as an option and the back deck is amazing.
