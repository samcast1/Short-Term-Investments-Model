There are signs indoors related to what the firewood & smores cost but some of the items are free for Airbnb guests. Overall would love to stay here again it was a very peaceful gateaway!"

Stayed one night","I chose to stay at the Getaway when in town visiting the North Cascades NP and I could not have been happier with my choice. This airbnb is, by far, one of the nicest places I have stayed. The location was absolute perfection, secluded and peaceful yet not too far from town where there were several food options available. The hosts go above and beyond to supply everything you could possibly need to enjoy your stay here, including all campfire amenities. Extremely well thought out and put together. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope to return again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely gorgeous cute place and spectacular views. I small toaster would have been nice. Also think at the price range/Coffee, water, smore kit and some wood etc should be included and not a separate list of extra costs as this is part of cabin experience (especially if you’re from Canada = can’t bring wood) and nothing really around so it’s not like you have options.. lots of other attention to details tho and would definitely recommend if you look to disconnect quickly from civilization. Lovely place!"

Place was clean, with shower and heater, pretty quiet, instructions are understandable, lots of kitchen supplies. Seems like they do care about their guests. So I would advice to visit after all"

Stayed one night","We had the most amazing stay at Getaway Cabin. Communication with the host was great, extremely responsive and instructions were given accurately. Every information we needed were given and check in process was extremely easy. I couldn’t say enough good things about this stay. The cabin was everything we needed and more. We felt safe and at peace. The cabin was pristine, modern and squeaky clean. There was even s’mores kit, water, tea, hot chocolate, coffee that are available for purchase and firewood that we used for a nice bonfire at night. The little kitchen has everything you’ll need to cook a meal from pans, utensils to cutleries. It was nice to disconnect and reconnect with nature. We felt recharged and felt really good after our stay. I couldn’t recommend this place enough to people who would like experience the beautiful cabin and disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city for a bit. We will definitely be back! Thank you so much Getaway Cabin!"

Stayed one night","This is my first time staying at the Mount Vernon location and it was the perfect time with the Tulip Festival going on which is only a 20 minutes drive away.
In comparison to the one I stayed at in southern Washington (drive through Portland and back up north into Washington) the bathroom door swings outward rather than inward giving the bathroom a little more space which was a plus.
Location, sleep, pictures are all just as listed. I’ll be staying with TheGetaway again for sure."

Stayed with a pet","Nice place to do a getaway. Very comfortable place to stay in wilderness with all facilities. A bit expensive to what it is in terms of size. It's not a cabin but very well designed truck with everything you need. Best is that they allow pets. No activity place nearby to my knowledge, the forest is not very dense so doesn't give great views from the window.
Overall great place for a glamping experience."

Be aware that the complimentary items in the listing (e.g., firewood, coffee) actually have an additional price/charge attached--based on item menu located inside the cabin. Also, while we generally experienced quiet during our stay, there were a few hours one evening when noise from a neighboring group could be heard from inside the cabin. That being said, it's a beautiful and convenient location."

I didn’t want to leave, and I stared out the window of my little cabin for hours, this was a very peaceful and safe place for me to process my emotions and I am so grateful for the people who thought up and helped make this space. I will be returning as soon as possible. Thank you so much.🖤🌲"

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful cabin, such a wonderful experience in these adorable, well-equipped tiny homes that were well spaced out for privacy.
Although, the only problems were the outdated advertising with what is included in your booking such as complimentary firewood and smores...that actually weren't complimentary as we found out when we saw the listed prices in the cabin. It was also disappointing that they didn't bother to answer the questions we asked, I don't know if it was just automated messages we were receiving for our welcome and not a real person (likely).
Other than that, it was a wonderful escape and we do want to come back again. And we really appreciate the extra touches for our dog."

Cabin is well equipped with daily essentials and also has provision for camp fire along with its instruction. Bedsheet and linen were clean and well maintained. Bathroom were clean with all the required necessities - towels, soaps etc.
Good part is it has both AC and Heater. Service staff were prompt, helpful and amicable.
We will definitely visit again. Thanks."

What I appreciated the most was the small details (s’mores kit, firewood, hot chocolate, deck of cards, analog speaker, lamp!). They really thought of everything for you to unplug and ‘getaway’! Also super responsive team. Would book again. :)"

Stayed a few nights","It was a beautiful getaway! The place looks exactly like the pictures and felt very private. While there were other cabins around, trees obscured your view of them so you felt like you had the whole forest to yourself! The hide-away was a little hard to find the first time (it was in the third ring of cabins) but after an initial search, it was simple and easy to get to. It definitely fits the category of tiny home, which was great in promoting the feeling of escape. It has everything you need for a great get-away. It even came with a phone time-out box to aid in disconnecting. Cabin was well stocked with what you needed and we were even able to cook a full meal! It had everything you needed to feel comfy and at home in the woods. Mornings were spent eating breakfast outside, enjoying the sun and scenery. Overall, great place to stay and would recommend it for anyone hoping to escape the ""real world"" for a few days!"

Stayed with a pet","Overall, I loved it. The space and amenities were great. It was awesome to know how dog-friendly and inviting it was. There was a wire ""leash"" you could use outside for your dog and they provided treats (which my dog loved) and poop bags.
Few things I'd tell others: Be mindful of reception. I have g.oogleFI and my service wasn't affected much. You might have neighbors. The cabin I got was decently away from the other one so it wasn't bad. If you have a dog, they'll be able to see each other. The cabin you get and its view may be very different from what's on their photos. I was content with mine because there was a huge tree in front and provided the feeling of being surrounded by nature. Though based off the images, I was expecting more of an open view. Few food options around without driving 20-30min so prepare accordingly.
It was great escape and would definitely be open to visiting again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great concept for “glamping”. We prefer day hikes that are technical and afterwords a comfortable bed and hot shower is just what we needed. The small space is perfect for two, with the ability to use the height of the shelving to tuck away our gear and keep the space less cluttered. The bed and bedding was comfortable to recover for the next days adventures.
One thing about this location, do not expect a scalding hot shower. It is warm, not cold, but not a steam shower. Again, this was not an issue for us, just informing.
Due to the burn ban, we had to grill on propane and the skillet inside. We had all the necessary kitchen utensils for prep and eating. The little packets of olive oil was such a nice touch.
Looking forward to finding more of these across the US and stay in for our next hiking vacation."

Stayed over a week","This was our second awesome stay with Brad & Eileen and will not be the last!
The location is 'in the country', but a very easy central location to tulips, Mt Vernon, Conway, La Conner, Bellingham, Anacortes etc.
Nestled in the Skagit Valley, there are fields on all sides, with mountains surrounding, the vistas are amazing. The studio is filled with light from windows on three sides, but the shades are totally adjustable up and down to sleep. One can watch sunrise out the kitchenette window, then sunset in the opposite window, or both from the outside deck. It is georgous.
Depending on the season, there are snow geese, multiple varieties of ducks, bald eagles and other wildlife all over. In the summer, there are wild blackberries to pick along the roadsides. Being 'in the country', there are crops in the fields, or farmers preparing for planting or harvest (at enough distance to enjoy watching, not to disturb the peace of the surroundings).
Thank you for a wonderful visit!"

This location can’t be beat if you’re a fan, like me and my husband, of bird and nature photography. It’s well appointed with everything you might need to make for a fantastic experience. If you find you didn’t bring warm enough clothing, they have you covered with hats, clothes, boots, you name it. We spent New Year’s Eve here and it was quiet, peaceful and the sunrise as well as the sunset was wonderful. And you have an amazing view of Mt. Baker from the kitchen window! And their cat is as friendly and welcoming as Brad and Eileen. Note: I’ve shared this listing with numerous friends only with the understanding that they don’t dare stay here when we want it! 😁"

The views are endless with fields for days to the west and Mount Baker across the fields to the northeast is a gorgeous view to wake up to. The studio was warm and comfortable, very inviting and felt like home. We enjoyed exploring the area with its numerous farm stands and gorgeous parks for hiking. Brad & Eileen were super responsive to messages and also offer the use of their Level 2 charger if you drive electric, this was definitely an added bonus. We’d certainly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in quite a few rentals over the past 6months, but this space tops them all. It has views, comfort and relaxation, nearby activities/shopping/food, and wonderful hosts!
You can view Mt Baker through the window while in bed, and it is stunning. The bed itself is one of the comfiest I’ve slept in. The unit setup is practical, with all necessities at hand, but there are also many personal touches to make you feel at home.
Nearby are ample outdoor activities if you enjoy hiking or biking. In less than 5 minutes you can drive to the Skagit Wildlife Recreation area, which is an easy walk filled with nature and mountain views. I can do it justice with words, but just know it’s worth it. Also close by is a neat shop/cafe, Snow Goose Produce, and the charming town of La Connor. I could spend weeks here and never get bored.
While the unit is extremely private, I also had the pleasure of getting to know Brad and Eileen and their sweet pup, Hugo. They are such warm and welcoming hosts and I look forward to visiting with them again!"

It's a good idea to bring some food with you otherwise you have to drive into LA Conner or Mt Vernon which aren't that far but far enough that you can't go out real quick to grab some food because there isn't much around there. Communication with hosts was quick and they provided detailed instructions for checking in etc. I would definitely go back for another getaway.

And access/entry to the studio was contactless and easy, and felt like it was its own separate enough space, that felt almost like it’s own private getaway. Brad and Eileen are excellent hosts. They ensured we had plenty of privacy and places to enjoy the beautiful outdoors on their property.

I'm an avid cyclist, and the riding opportunities from Brad and Eileen's are fabulous. The 15 mile ride to La Conner had almost no cars to fret over. I just keep coming back."

The space is not really conducive to full on cooking but that's not really a problem as there are so many brewpubs, bakeries, and restaurants in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Didn’t want to leave this peaceful, bright, comfortable home with great hosts! The setting is beautiful and away from the (quiet) road, feeling secluded. I needed a quiet space with no distractions and was very happy to only hear sounds of nature and distant farming. Plenty of birds to watch from the big windows overlooking fields/garden. Really appreciated the private balcony with chairs/table to eat outside in sun or shade during the record-breaking heatwave. It was great to know my hosts were next door if needed, ready and willing to help, providing electric fans and checking all was well via Airbnb messages - excellent communication - and I was blessed with privacy! Best balance! The large studio space was homely, beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. Many interesting objects, art, books, games, and a file of useful info. I found the kitchenette to have all I needed for basic cooking and a beautiful view of Mount Baker. Great shower with quality products provided. Wondered if I would miss having a bathroom sink but it was not an issue at all. I really appreciate good quality bedding, towels etc and had more than I needed to feel at home. Thank you so much for thinking of the details!"

Stayed a few nights",Barb and Eileen's studio is tranquil and in the most beautiful location. The well appointed space has big windows all around that look out on the lush Skagit farmlands with a straight shot to Mount Baker. I would love to be there when the snow geese visit the region! Our stay coincided with unprecedented heatwave which was a challenging without AC but the open screened windows and fan helped immensely.

Brad and Eileen were very respectful of our space, and had prepared our room to be very clean and welcoming prior to our arrival. We did catch the tail end of a “heat wave” that was rolling through, but it cooled off nicely with windows open and a fan going once the sun went down. Plenty to do within a short drive of here, as well as board games and TV in the studio space. Lovely place, and we would love to stay again next time we are in town!"

Stayed a few nights","Let me see, where should I start! Mountain View is an incredible, peaceful, enjoyable, relaxing place to spend your time away from home. Every morning we awakened and looked out the inviting windows and watched the rabbits hopping around on the grass, birds flitting everywhere full of song. Two mornings we caught sight of the duck family, mom and six little ducklings, as they swam in the canal that wanders by. I looked out one afternoon when we’d popped in to regroup and there was a bald eagle in the field!
The room itself is very well appointed having everything to make your stay comfortable. The decorating is very tasteful and inviting, the bed comfortable, the kitchenette conveniently stocked.
The location is great. You can be to freeway and several towns in just minutes. Ideal!
And Brad and Eileen are warm, welcoming and pleasant to visit with should you get the chance.
We look forward to returning."

Stayed about a week","We were taking the NOLS Wilderness First Responder course across the highway in Conway and were so lucky to find this pastoral oasis that we could retreat to every lunch and evenings. The birdsongs were spectacular every morning as the mist rose from the fields below the splendor of Mt Baker. Warm, inviting, and calm welcomed us home every day to catch up on studying, enjoy a meal by the culvert, or walk into town for a tasty burger at the Conway Pub. Take a run along the river, a paddle in the waterways, and meander around this verdant gem of land, the Skagit Valley. We stayed for 10 days and were ready to stay longer, great hosts, kitchen supplies, and a very comfy bed!"

Stayed a few nights","Brad and Eileen's place is wonderful and one of our all time favorites at this point. It is very peaceful and calming, a great place to get away from the hustle of our daily lives. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings with birds chirping, ducks in the fields, and we even got to see a spectacular migration of snow geese. I am not exaggerating when I say we saw miles of them flying across the sunset horizon. We couldn't believe how many there were and how long it went.
The studio itself is beautifully appointed, super clean, and very comfortable. And with views out every window. We said we'd put these finishes in our own home. Brad and Eileen were available to answer any questions we had, but left us in peace otherwise. And it is a very short distance to everything we wanted to check out; the Tulip Festival in Mount Vernon, Anacortes, and super cute La Conner. We'd definitely come back even if just to relax and get away from it all."

Stayed a few nights","A winter birding and quiet retreat paradise! I'm a novice birder...and with the views of the valley from the studio, I saw so many birds just from the windows. I counted 12 species within the first hour of waking, including water birds because of the slough just on the edge of the property. It was a true delight to have a flock of thousands of snow geese fly over the studio nearly every morning and evening and land in the field across the way. There are also several nature preserves and hiking spots just within 10 miles of the property. If you are in need of quiet, solitude (or a coupled get-a-way), this is quite the spot. I didn't want to leave.
To note: it is a kitchenette, without stove. I managed to prepare simple meals for a few days stay just fine with the microwave."

It's bright, clean and quite comfortable (especially the bed!) and well equipped with everything I needed. There's no stove, but there's a microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker and hot pot, a sink with a great mountain view, great linens and a comfortable sofa. Access is easy with a keypad, there's parking available and Eileen was quick to respond to queries. There's a packet of local information provided that's very helpful. It's quiet and comfortable. I highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Valley."

Stayed a few nights","Thank you so much Marie and Alex for hosting us!
My partner and I stayed for two nights for our anniversary and felt immediately like we had just arrived in heaven. The property and location of the unit is perfect in that it feels extremely private as there is nothing for miles in front of it. The hot tub was divine, especially during the rain. The goats were so sweet and friendly and we watched them for hours. Trixie is the sweetest cat I have ever met and she immediately climbed into my lap and fell asleep. If you are a cat lover, you will be pleasantly surprised.
The unit is a short drive into a cute little town with everything you need. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked and there were plenty of extra linens. The bed in the loft was extremely comfortable. One note is that the staircase up the loft is extremely steep. We left a light on to prevent any mishaps during the night.
We will for sure be returning. Thank you for leaving us tea and a bottle of wine!"

The large wall of windows that look out from the living room faces the goat enclosure. There were several very young goats frolicking about. It was essentially Goat TV. We spent a good amount of time just watching the baby goats bouncing around. It was surprisingly entertaining.

The hosts had some great recommendations for food and activities that we really enjoyed - adrift for dinner, and mount erie for sunset. The wifi was good for 2 of us to work remotely. Maybe our favorite part - the barn cat Trixie who would hang out with us on the deck. She was the sweetest cat we have ever met.

They were very responsive and allowed us to receive packages a few times during our stay, even getting a package that ended up in their mailbox and delivering it to our door within minutes of finding out it was in the mailbox. We enjoyed evenings in the hot tub while watching the beautiful sunset and the funny antics of the goats. The inside space was lovely and the outdoor space made the trip!"

You have a wonderful view over the fields to the mountains in the distance.
In the apartment you will find everything you need. The kitchen is very well equipped.
Surroundings are very quiet, so you can sleep excellently and explore the surroundings during the day.
Seattle or Vancouver can also be reached for a day trip.
Once we plan a trip to the Seattle area, we will surely be back."

Stayed one night","The Granary was a wonderful anchor point for anyone wanting to explore Skagit county. It is only a short drive from Mount Vernon and a 14 minute drive to La Conner. Both towns have boutique shops, restaurants, and other activities to try out. Also, this is just minutes away from a wide number of trails and parks for you find a stroll through nature or curiously investigate some tide pools.
The Granary is comfortable, airy, and spacious for two people. It was quiet and relaxing. The sunset overlooking farmland and the mountains in the distance was stunning from the porch (or even the hot tub). While we didn't use the kitchen, it was well equipped for people who like to prepare their own food.
Marie and Alex were incredibly communicative and helpful in their responses. I highly recommend this as a retreat to the countryside."

Stayed a few nights","There is a peaceful view across farm fields to the coastal hills. This unit sits at the back of the property near the barn, so it's quiet, and pleasantly dark. Everyone mentions the cat... she is an absolute love and will climb all over you if allowed. The goats add a touch of comic relief.
Compared to other Air BnB places we have stayed, this one has a very nice kitchen. There are spices, pots and pans, cooking knives and utensils - everything you need for this kind of stay.
The loft is pleasant, and the upstairs windows continue the view to the west very nicely. The bed is very comfortable. But if you're someone who makes a lot of trips to the bathroom in the night, it's not the most convenient to climb down the ladder.
We enjoyed the little hot tub, even in the rain. They keep it at 102, but as they point out it heats up very quickly to 104. The jets don't do much, but its a good hot soak.
Really nice hosts, and we loved it!"

The privacy was wonderful, just us and the goats and view of the horizon over beautiful farmland. The loft bed was fun to climb up to and also has a beautiful view in the morning. It does get hot at night because heat rises, so I would recommend using the fan next to the bed and/or turning off the heat. Shower is spacious and nice. We really enjoyed the thoughtfully curated assortment of furniture and decorations. Perfect place for my sister and I to enjoy a glass of wine at night and use as a hopping off point to Deception Pass and Bellingham."

Stayed a few nights","Marie and Alex have curated a truly wonderful space to relax and unwind, and it was a joy to spend our wedding weekend at their place. The view is amazing, the decor was beautiful, and their communication made everything relaxing and simple for us. 10/10 would recommend. The best parts? The goats, hot tub, them being openly LGBTQ friendly and Trixie the barn cat. I’d stay again just to come cuddle Trixie!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at the Granary! It was the perfect home base for our adventures in the San Juan Islands and surrounding area. It is located about 30 minutes from the Anacortes ferry terminal and close to great food options in the Skagit Valley. The tiny home was well decorated and had all the amenities that we needed for our trip. After a long day exploring the area, we enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub under a clear night sky – it was truly restorative! We had fun feeding the goats and playing with the resident cat Trixie, who were both really friendly! Thank you Alex & Marie for sharing your space with us. We can't wait to be back!"

We ate oysters in Edison, then had a fire at Deception Pass State Park.

The interior was extremely clean and well appointed — a good mix of modern and heritage touches. Wifi was solid, and I had decent cell phone reception (T-Mobile). The kitchen was stocked with essential equipment and tools, so it was easy to cook meals. I think the property has a couple of rentable spaces but I didn’t notice anyone else while there, so it felt pretty private. Would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I chose this place based off the previous reviews and they were spot on. This place was awesome, had everything we could need, and was spotless when we arrived. It has a full kitchen setup with anything you could need, even down to the spices and chopsticks! It also has a very big fridge that can hold a lot of food if you are needing to cook there. The bathroom was large and fully stocked with amazing smelling shampoo/conditioner/ and body lotion and comfy robes that fit curvy girls very well. The living room was set up beautifully and the couch was super comfy. The loft upstairs was a dream! The bed was very comfy and had felt like it had a memory foam topper on it. There is a window above the sliding doors that is perfectly aligned with the bed, so the view in the morning was amazing and probably my favorite part. They back deck has some rocking chairs that made watching the sunset perfect. The hot tub was awesome as well once the sun went down and it got chilly. The goats and the barn cat Trixie were an added bonus and so much fun to interact with. The hosts were also very good and quick with communication. Whether it be getting us an iron and steamer upon request or giving us recommendations for a place to get great seafood. They were awesome hosts! All in all we loved the Granary and our experience with the grounds. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely be staying here again."

It was also pretty quiet except for the distant sounds of the road and the goats nearby. The goats were fun to watch and the barn cat is very friendly. There are also some great farms nearby for those looking for fresh produce.

I wish they didn't only leave plastic ware. It's not expensive (better for the environment) to just supply a pair of real silverware. Not a fan of not having control of the heat but she provided a variety of blankets, mini heaters and fans so it wasn't really bad.
I would stay again and recommend."

The location is great, still in Mount Vernon, but in a quiet, residential neighborhood.
Communication with the hostess was excellent, and both she and her husband were very prompt in helping us out when we needed them.
Something that ought to be mentioned on the website, but isn't, is the fact that one needs to navigate three fairly high steps between the living room (with kitchenette) and the bedroom/ bathroom, and that there is no rail to hold onto. It would not be the right place for people with mobility issues."

Yost really went above and beyond to make sure that I was taking care of, if I needed anything extra, communicated quickly, and were kind, helpful especially in unique circumstances. I have a lot of trust in them, and they really helped when I was coming from a big event with lots of supplies, busy schedule, limited capacity/extra stress, they made my time there so much easier.
The location is perfect with the easy side entrance in a quiet cul-de-sac with great nature lives in the neighborhood, which was quiet and peaceful. It was such a great value, I was almost surprised, and they accommodated me when I asked for an adjustment on my time there, and we’re really fair with pricing when they could have accepted more money, which makes a big difference for me. i just trust people who don’t just take the more money because They can, like a lot of profit-based operations. I had a faux paw I felt bad about and they were so gracious/understanding. Highly recommend :)"

Just what we needed for a quick overnight stay. Appreciated the binder with all the details of the cozy casita and local recommendations and the water bottles for us in the fridge upon our arrival was a nice touch. Azucena was a great host!"

Azucena’s place was not only a great deal in price but their casita was just perfect for an overnight stay. The hosts were extremely helpful and responsive with any questions I had. Also very friendly and flexible too! We loved their space and the vibe it shared made us feel right at home. 😊 Would definitely stay here again next time we’re up in that area.

Azucena was a great communicator throughout the entire stay and even after our stay she was kind enough to answer some of my question about items we had left behind. The place itself was very clean. The bedsheets and all linens were clean. The bathroom was spotless. The place smelled very pleasant. It was nicely decorated. The details were appreciated like a few water bottles in the fridge. A white noise machine in the bedroom. A binder with all the details of the cozy casita as well as local recommendations. The neighborhood was beautiful. We highly recommend staying here if you are in the area!

Christine was helpful with her communication and was very timely with responses. It was helpful to read comments and recommendations from other guests in the guest book and there were helpful resources. We would definitely book this space next we visit because of the three bedrooms with comfortable and quiet rooms and a fully equipped kitchen.

Very relaxing stay and the host did a great job communicating. They even found us a pumpkin festival at a local nursery to check out. The region has tons of agricultural highlights to check out. La Conner is a short drive as well."

It is attached to the host’s main home, but we never ran into the family (if privacy is your thing) but knew we could contact them if we were interested in doing things like riding bikes or using the fire pit. Their little farm was so cute and had an amazing view of the mountains! We enjoyed petting the cats and watching the ducks/chickens/guineas run around. We chose this Airbnb to have a place to stay while we could make a day trip out to North Cascades National Park - it was approximately a 1 hour drive to the park from this Airbnb, which was perfect for spending the whole day at the park and then coming back to clean up and rest. We enjoyed our stay!"

What you see in the pictures is what you see in person, even better! It brought me and my boyfriend so much comfort when we first entered the place. And it was so nice/made the stays so much better when we spoke to Julienne and her husband about the place, their animals, nearby locals, etc. They were the most kindhearted people I ever met.
If you ever plan/thinking about staying in this place, don't think twice please go to this airbnb! so much fun staying here with your friends, yourself and or partner."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, 5 minutes to a very quaint downtown area. Rental was clean, but bedding was disappointing, the sheets and pillowcases had a strong musty smell and the bed did not have a blanket, only sheets and a quilted bed spread that under normal circumstances I would have turned down to sleep but in this case I had to use it as a blanket and found it uncomfortable. That was our only disappointment though...it really was a nice stay for the two of us and we would stay again."

Stayed a few nights",the place was nice and clean and appreciated the amenities provided. the off-street parking in that area appeared to be a bonus. the only warning was to watch your toes in the one bedroom. the frame sticks out a bit farther than the bed and the corner posts were toe cathchers. Would recommend this place. Mt Vernon was a nice little area.

I had all of the amenities I needed plus things you would never get in a hotel. The train nearby was loud during the day (because…it’s a train) but I could not hear it at all while sleeping. The bed was extremely comfortable and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again."

We enjoyed the location and the great patio. Although it was very hot outside, the patio and the house stayed quite cool. We only turned on the A/C very briefly a couple of times and it cooled quickly inside.
They do supply some breakfast items like yogurt, nutrigrain type bars, and instant oatmeal. Also some good coffee, tea bags and half and half. The house seems very new and clean. Chairs were comfy and TV worked great.
We would stay here again in the future!

Stayed a few nights","Our stay and Susan & Jim's was exceptional. Everything was perfect!
The apartment is cute and immaculate. It was literally spotless and everything you might have forgotten was available. Susan and Jim even left snacks which was greatly appreciated!
The bed was literally the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, as were the pillows. The furnishings are comfortable and beautiful.
There is off street parking right in front of your doorstep. I felt very comfortable leaving my car with my kayak on top outside unlocked. The neighborhood is quiet and quite lovely and very peaceful.
There are basic TV channels available and strong WiFi.
Because the hosts live above the apartment, you will hear human and dog foot steps . (no barking at all). I happen to love dogs and found the footsteps endearing.
If you are a light sleeper and want to sleep in, earplugs might be helpful. (I noticed even earplugs were available for guest use in the bathroom. They thought of everything!).
This was the nicest AirBnB I have stayed in and I highly recommend it if you're a thoughtful guest who would appreciate all the personal touches put into this lovely place.
I would definitely stay again if I am in the area."

My little girl kept saying, “are we going back to our Airbnb.” So sweet. It was a lovely place to spend time.
If you are sensitive sleepers, it might be good for you to bring a sound machine because you can sometimes hear walking upstairs in the am.

Stayed a few nights","This was a great place for our family group of 3 people. The house is spacious and well-appointed. The house was clean and the yard was green and blooming. This was a good home base for exploring the Skagit Valley and Bellingham. I feel it's worth noting that the bathroom is on a different level than the bedrooms. There are plenty of lights you can turn on to light your way at night, but it might be challenging for someone with vision or mobility issues. However, this wasn't a problem for me and I would definitely stay here again."

The place is a little boring. As a starting point around the islands, but fine. Towards Seattle, another good outlet.
The honking of the trains is really not nice. Feeling like freight trains are just getting started in the evening. But after a few days you get used to it. For a long time. 😅
But at the end, the owners can't help it. The train in the US has probably hardly evolved since the 70s."

There were robes for each bedroom. The kitchen was large and light. The whole house was light and decorated comfortably. There was a convenience store at the end of the road. The towels were fluffy and there were plenty. They had nice shower gel and shampoo and conditioner and a great sink and kitchen utensils. The bedrooms were a bit bright with blinds. All the windows had beautiful blinds. There was a train occasionally but the neighbourhood was quite and sweet. They had a nice deck and picnic table and yard not fully fenced but cute for my kids to play with me. It was easy entry and exit. I hope to stay again in a place great for my kids.

Stayed a few nights","Nice little area, a little hot in the summer so you’ll be using the portable AC unit they have. We had a problem with the sound on the TV and the owners came over right away to fix it. Really friendly people. Cool stay."

Stayed a few nights","The house was very clean and nicely decorated. The quick access to the interstate was great for exploring the area. Loved the view of the mountains and sunset each evening. Personal preference, but would have liked curtains in the kitchen as sometimes we felt on display."

Stayed with kids","Super rad house with lots of windows. One room at windows all around, it was great. Blinds blocked out the sunshine in the morning very well letting us sleep in. Loved staying here and will more than likely return again next summer. Very close to downtown too!!"

Stayed a few nights",Fantastic place to stay! We had plans of visiting San Juan Islands and this was a great alternative as it was very easy to get to the ferry terminal. Jane's place is the best AirBnB I have ever stayed - hands down! She had wonderful amenities from the comfy beds and sofa to the breakfast fixings to the bottle of wine to the very large TV! I would recommend staying here and I would definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","Very clean and comfortable place to call home away from home. Newly renovated. A little high tech, smart home so us “seniors” had to learn how to use the tv, but Jane and Duncan were super responsive to our requests for help. Their hospitality went above and beyond, providing eggs, bread, butter and yogurt for breakfast fixings. Excellent place to stay! Highly recommended."

Stayed one night","really enjoyed my stay Hill Cottage and hope to have another visit. Conveniently located near I-5, you do not hear the sound of traffic at all, though you may hear a distant train horn in the early morning, which I thought was cool! Quiet residential neighborhood, not far from downtown and local restaurants, shops, etc. Really appreciated the host keeping me up to date and providing easy to understand instructions on how to access house, internet, TV, etc. Nice deck/s, Simple and minimalist decorations, a thumbs up on that!"

Stayed a few nights","Great house - clean, comfortable and quiet! It had everything we needed for our weekend stay. The television is enormous and the couch comfy, if you decide you want to watch a couple movies and the outdoor space would be a great place to hang out if it didn't rain all weekend. : ) We slept well and appreciated the house's aesthetic. Thanks!"
