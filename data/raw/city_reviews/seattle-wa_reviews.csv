Stayed a few nights",I loved that it was close to a lot of restaurants. There was lots to do in the area but if you’re not a walker I recommend using the bird or lime scooters. It’s WWAAAAAYYYYY cheaper than getting an Uber. The place was great but if you do like a dark setting in the morning it’s probably not it. The windows are huge with white blinds. I personally loved the windows but not the bright natural light in the mornings especially having some drinks or staying up late that pervious night. Overall my best friend and I had a great time and will do it all over again.

You can not beat location, walking distance to everything; we walked to MoPop, space needle, Pikes Market , aquarium and excellent restaurants. Phuong is a wonderful host! We had a great time and would definitely come back! Thank you Phuong!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved the location, and of course the cool Seattle air! We were a close walk to most everything. In unit washer/dryer was great to have so we could return home with clean clothes in our luggage. Lots of books to read.
We enjoyed the guest journal of things to do and see! Very helpful. We love to sleep with the windows slightly ajar. We had plenty of blankets to stay warm while slept. The late night sounds (sirens, garbage trucks, and early morning seagulls) were only slightly distracting. We could have opted to keep the windows closed, but liked them slightly open while sleeping, better."

Stayed a few nights","If you plan to come to Seattle, please book here! Phuong made my first trip to Seattle nothing but pleasant. Instructions were provided clearly prior to check-in and the host was very responsive through the process. Phuong makes sure to provide you with what you need. Location is perfectly in the middle of the city and everything was within walking distance, allowing us to walk and explore the area freely without straying too far from the space provided. My girlfriend and I loved staying here and we will be sure to book again with Phuong the next time we are in Seattle!"

Stayed a few nights","We recently had the pleasure of staying at Phuong's place, and it was truly a fantastic experience. The property lived up to its description! From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the cozy atmosphere. The rooftop was amazing – can't wait to return in the summer months so we can spend more time up there.
The location was unbeatable, within walking distance from all the key attractions we wanted to explore in Seattle. Everything was conveniently close!
We plan on coming back to Seattle and will definitely try to reserve Phuong's place when we return. Book it! You won't be disappointed. FIVE STARS!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This studio was lovely and clean. Free parking was a great bonus! We were close to everything. Phuong was a great host. Furnishings and decor were very nice, and the building inside was clean and secure. The only drawback to the location was that the studio overlooked the alley below. A light sleeper might have trouble at night with noise in the alley. Some nearby establishments had trash and recycling cans out there, and trucks came by often to collect. Everything else about the location was great!"

The apartment was very comfortable -nice kitchen- and stylish, with a great cityscape view. We'd wake up each morning and duck down to Macrina's for coffee and a pastry. Very helpful host.
Remarkably walkable we strolled to the Space Needle, museums, the Seattle Underground tour, shopping, Pikes Place, and even the international district.
Looking forward to a return visit."

The places in the main downtown are within walking distance, so I enjoyed the city sightseeing without using public transportation. Especially the wing at the bar on the first floor of the building is delicious. I hope you try it!"

It has everything you need for a short or long stay, including a kitchen that seemed well stocked even though we didn't prepare any meals. Our only complaint was that the windows face a noisy alley, so keep that in mind if you're looking for someplace quieter."

Easily walkable to the Pike Place Market and International District and the best part is that there is a parking spot! Everything about check-in and check-out is pretty straight forward and simple. He even had AC! It was unseasonably hot the day we went so it was definitely a plus.

I enjoyed the location: I walked to Whole Food and Target- the Space Needle could be seen from the condo window. Pike Place Market was down the street. There was night life; boutiques and restaurants were feet away. Ocean and Mountain Views helped me transition from my cruise and, the port was only about 10 minutes away— in traffic."

Stayed a few nights","The location is great! Not too far from everything, great restaurants within a <5 minute walk, and relatively easy to find! Phuong was very communicative.
I will say though, maybe we were at a bad angle or we're just too short, but we could only see the very top of the space needle, unlike the pictures we saw showed. The alleyway to enter/exit the garage is very suspicious with people loitering in there pretty frequently.
The space is very cozy and they have almost all the streaming apps! We're not firm bed people, so the bed wasn't our favorite.
Overall, the walkablility of the location and the free parking are the best parts! Not sure it's worth our money, but not everything can be everyone's cup of tea. :)"

Phuong takes such amazing care of this rental and we could immediately see that they take pride in being quick to return any communication or questions. We kicked off a week and a half road trip by staying here and watching a couple baseball games. Knowing how big Seattle was, and having driven our own car (a Honda Civic), the extremely secure in-building parking and entry/exit of the building itself alleviated any concerns I might have had about driving my personal vehicle. You absolutely can't beat the price when it comes to this amazing location paired with the previously mentioned parking arrangement. Ridiculously close to everything along the water, the Seattle Center, and so many other things I can't even list them all; walking distance is an understatement! My wife and I absolutely recommend this spot and will with a doubt be staying here again next summer. Thank you for helping us kick off our road trip on such an amazingly bright note. See you again soon!! - Loryl and Mary -"

Stayed a few nights","This apartment was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. It was walking distance from both Pike Place market as well as the Space Needle. There are tons of restaurants and things to do in the area. The building itself is very secure and is super neat! We loved seeing the historical pictures on the wall of the lobby. The apartment itself is very small but the space works really well for two people. The only issue we had was that there was no air conditioning and it happened to be extremely hot in Seattle when we were there. There were fans and windows, but we were still hotter than we would have liked.
Phuong was also extremely communicative and provided quick responses and recommendations for the area. We had no issues getting in the building or parking, and you can tell she really put a lot of thought into decorating and making the apartment nice for guests."

Parking is tight (as she mentions in the listing) but we only had a car for part of our trip. There is plenty of transit stations and lots to do within walking distance. Parking in the city can be tricky once you leave the building so avoid a rental car if you can. The location is ideal for many of the tourist spots.

Stayed a few nights","Phuong texted us in advance lots of good instructions for getting to the space, parking and entering. It seems like a lot, but/and all very very useful and appreciated.
The location is perfect. The space is comfortable enough to chill inside, tho it’s location again is perfect, so you’re going to want to walk just a few blocks to get food, see sights and just immerse yourself in downtown Seattle.
I let Phuong know the unit could use a deep deep cleaning. It could also use some upgrades like nice glasses/dishes and a few more, current magazines, but the price and location and communication were all spot on, so we agree we would stay here again.
Highly recommend Roquette for good (also expensive) drinks really close and just south of the front entrance of the apartment, Limoncello for delicious pizza and salad and Bangrok Market for absolutely amazing Thai just a few blocks away.
Phuong’s place is just a short walk to Pike’s Place” (about two blocks away) and also the space needle."

The ONLY problem we had was a heavy-footed and constantly moving upstairs neighbor.

Having parking was amazing. The parking spot is very compact, but we were able to fit my crossover SUV. Anything larger definitely wouldn’t fit. There were a lot of food options and plenty of bars/pubs. It was a short walk to Pike’s Place and we could see the the very top of the space needle from our room. We will definitely stay again if we ever return to Seattle."

Stayed about a week",Phuong’s place was great-the space is well organized with everything you could need and very comfortable. The location couldn’t be better for getting around on foot or by car. Lots of great food and things to do nearby. Parking is a must have if you bring a car. It wasn’t a problem for us but be aware that garbage is picked up between 10-10:30 pm so if you go to sleep early and the windows are open you will want earplugs.

We did find that the floor was sticky in our Airbnb so I’m not sure if maybe the incorrect cleaner was used or if they weren’t mopped but that wasn’t too big of an issue for us. There was some makeup on a towel hanging on the back of the door when we arrived as if it was left by a previous renter as well so we left that towel alone. Overall the stay was enjoyable and we would stay here again in the future. I do think the water heater may need some maintenance since it’s an old building 🥶

Positives: perfect location. Easy access. Great communication.
Negative: loud (but earplugs provided thankfully - nice touch!), bed sheets too small for the bed, shower was cold one morning and is a short shower head (if that matters to you). And there is no view, which didn’t matter to us because we were out during the days.
We would stay again for this type of trip."

Stayed a few nights","Our two night stay was fine, and about as expected. The building is centrally located in downtown, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. It's easy to get in and out as needed. The space definitely seemed smaller than the pictures, which clearly show the best possible version of the rooms. We didn't have an issue accommodating to the place. This is essentially a hotel suite with the bedroom separate, more than a vacation home. The beds were decent, but not great, and the small kitchen was only stocked with the bare minimum. You wouldn't want to go there expecting to really cook anything. There were no ice trays in the freezer, for example. The bathroom had a picture hanging on a stained wall that said ""So Fresh and So Clean"" which was certainly ironic. The lack of parking also adds to the overall expense of the stay, so definitely something to keep in mind. Ours was $90 in a secure lot from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning."

Stayed one night","Mine is in a great location and easy to get around the city. We had a challenge with the key code when we arrived with the building door. We finally were able to get it to work. Inside Mine could use a little extra cleaning here and there.
Our biggest challenge was the key code the next morning. There were four of us staying at Mine. Three of us left to go get coffee, and when we returned the key code did not work on the outside door or apartment door. We had to call the 4th person staying with us to come down and let us in. And the 4th person had to leave something in the apartment door so not to be locked out of the apartment.
We contacted Mine through Airbnb and did not receive a response until after we had checked out."

Location was GREAT.
Short walk from the Light Rail (caught from the airport) and an even shorter walk from Pikes!
So many great restaurants, coffee shops, shops, and sights to see! Great location for all forms of public transportation. Which are all safe and CHEAP. Even caught the Rail to a Mariners game and space needle.
The staff was very kind. The Man at the front was a sweetheart! Always checking in on us as we came and went. Asking if we needed anything. We got there earlier than check out but he kindly offered to hold our bags in a safe spot so we could explore while waiting.
Honestly, Im going back. Theres so much more I want to explore in seattle and At Mine is a MUST STAY. Well priced, great location, kind staff, and SAFE AREA.
Grateful for this place. I will recommend to anyone headed to Seattle City."

We needed to be close to Pike Place and The Symphony and all of the “must see” of Seattle and boy did this deliver. And at a competitive price of a Four Seasons. PLUS a private bedroom and a solid little kitchen (yes we cooked a steak and it was great). Our host was fantastic. Texting and ensuring we had everything we needed and was incredibly gracious with a late check out to accommodate our symphony tickets. I loved being able to go and grab coffee and then enjoy the morning with my daughter in the space. Quiet, secure, a very friendly and attentive front desk as well. Would stay again in a heartbeat!"

It ended up being a better deal, the place was perfect with a pull out In the living room for the kids and it was a block to Pikes Market and a short walk to T-Mobile Stadium . The room was just like the pictures.. decorated very nicely.. very good vibes .. the check in was so easy, I got a text with info right away and they even checked in later and made sure we were settled and had what we needed .

Stayed one night","This little apt at the Oxford was perfect for us 3
The master bed was very comfy
My son says the bed in the coach was comfy for a sofa bed it was a memory foam mattress.
The only thing was noise from the drunk peeps at 2:00am from Sonya’s bar across the street but it didn’t really last since we were out drinking too lol.
You got to go to the speakeasy in the alley “Bath tub gin “ very old school vibe.
Thanks again for the stay:))"

Stayed a few nights","Thank you At Mine rentals!
I stayed in one of At Mine's updated and stylish 1-BR apartments in the Oxford building, an attractive 1920s(?) era building located at the southern edge of Belltown neighborhood in downtown Seattle. A very appealing neighborhood to stay in: fun stuff in all directions, and close to three rail lines plus buses. The location and amenities made it the perfect spot for my visit, and the price was very competitive (cheaper than other options without sacrificing quality).
The rental is as advertised--it looks like the pictures. Large and somewhat luxurious bathroom with full size bathtub; high quality towels and bedding; spacious kitchen; high ceilings.
Staff was responsive and helpful. They stored my luggage the whole day after my checkout, which allowed me to explore the city more freely on my last day in town.
My verdict: visit Seattle, and stay with At Mine rentals. I highly recommend."

I'd describe it as plush rather than firm. Pillows were great too! Everything was clean, bathroom, living room, kitchen. There were enough towels too. The apartment has baseboard heaters and they work great. Pikes Place Market is walkable distance and theres lots to do nearby. You can either walk, use electric scooters/bikes, or UBER. Would recommend and stay here again :)"

Stayed one night","Amazing value for the price! I booked here last minute because I needed a place to stay in downtown Seattle for a spontaneous trip. I picked it because it was the most affordable, so I was very surprised to enter the property and be met with such high quality. Upon arriving, I had to enter a code to access both the building and the unit, which made me feel safe. There is a vending machine with snacks in the lobby! They provided us with very clear instructions on how to access our unit and we had no problems at all getting in quickly and safely. The unit was very clean and much more spacious than I expected, it had a fully stocked kitchen with lots of coffee ingredients and everything you could need! There is a TV and nice seating and lights in the living room. Even a table to eat or relax at. The bedroom was cozy and the bathroom was fully stocked with many soaps/lotions/towels/etc. I truly have no complaints. Staff were extremely quick to respond and very sweet and helpful!"

I was happily surprised that was not only a beautiful, clean and well-stocked apartment, but that it was one block away from Pike Place! I absolutely loved the area! And the host was very proactive about providing us with accurate information and parking recommendations. One small thing, is that Sunday night/Monday morning must’ve been garbage day, so in the middle of the night we were awaken by the loud trucks. If you plan on staying Sunday-Monday, just be sure to bring earplugs or use the provided white-noise machine. But even with that small issue, I will definitely be back!"

As mentioned in the listing, the soundproofing isn't great and we woke up multiple times during the night due to noises from the unit above or the street. The host did attempt to mitigate this with earplugs and white noise, but they don't help much.
Overall, really satisfied and we can see ourselves returning to this place again!"

Stayed a few nights","Look no further for your Seattle getaway – this place is an absolute gem! If you're visiting Pike Place Market or catching a game, you couldn't ask for a better location. Situated just blocks away from the bustling market but despite its proximity to the lively streets, the unit tucked away at the back of the building offers a serene retreat, ensuring a peaceful stay. The space is not only beautifully decorated but also incredibly spacious – a rarity in this vibrant neighborhood. Perfect for a couple or small family.
While the updated kitchen boasts all the amenities for whipping up a meal, with so many fantastic restaurants nearby, you'll likely find yourself in Seattle's culinary delights. Check-in was a breeze, thanks to the attentive host who's always just a message away, they're readily available either in person or through Airbnb. The building's elevator is a perk, plus, the street-accessible stairway adds an extra layer of convenience.
I can't recommend this place enough!"

However if you plan on going into the city I wouldn’t recommend this area to somebody without a car. It costs about $13 to take an Uber to the Angle light rail station ($20+ to go to the SeaTac light rail stop) and then it’s quite a long commute into the city - for me it was almost an hour. I had read other reviews that made the city sound more accessible, again if you don’t have a car this isn’t the case."

Stayed one night","Paul and his wife were great host! The communication was great & very friendly! I appreciate Paul's wife introducing herself and asking how are stay was!
Location : The location is pushed back area with beautiful views and the water. Took about 20-30 minutes to Seattle depending on traffic & close to restaurants and other parks!
Parking: was nice to be in the drive way on the gravel! Appreciate my car not having to be in the street!
Inside : Their home is beautiful, clean, & quiet. You have a room/bathroom/ living space to choose from, along with a nice porch to enjoy your coffee on!
Bed was nice, fans provided, & lots of blankets! (love to feel cozy)
Thanks again for the lovely stay, would recommend for short stay!"

Stayed one night","this is a room with private bath, but the hosts are so generous and so you feel as if you have a whole half house. But know that it does not include private kitchen, coffee, mini fridge type things.
For me it was just what this burnt out educator needed. I felt like I was sleeping at my best friend's parents house. It was very cozy. I am grateful."

Stayed one night","I needed a place before my early rotation and this place was so peaceful, the view was beautiful it made me not want to leave my room hahah!! Paul was very friendly and introduced himself to me before I left. Also their suggestion to take the metered cab was awesome, ($21) Be careful about ubering back it’s about $35-40 and the train isn’t close. I would totally come back here again in the summer and hopefully explore the neighborhood when it isn’t raining cause it’s SO pretty and very peaceful :)"

Stayed one night","Paul's residence is beautiful and so is the neighborhood. The bedroom was exceptionally clean, as was the lovely bathroom down the hall.15-20 min. to airport- $26-30.00
We didn't receive door code, and when our taxi arrived there were no lights on and it was raining so it was unclear which door was his in the dark. We had a lot of luggage, which got wet. I never actually met Paul or his wife, as they had guests last night and this morning.
The house could not have been more clean and the bed very comfortable. They have clearly put a lot of effort into having a top tier rental! I would definitely return!
The door code issue is on Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","Paul’s place was great for our needs (flying into SEA-TAC and then exploring seattle for a day before heading on a national parks road trip). The space was clean and private, and the area is right around Puget Sound, making it very peaceful and great for a hike! The view of Mt Rainier from the property is not necessarily what is shown in photos but a quick drive down to the Marine View Park provides a stunning view of Mt Rainier and Puget Sound, and the sunset/sunrise from the room is beautiful. Getting into the property was easy and water was left in our room in addition to some drinks and granola bars. My one suggestion for Paul is to please provide a water cooler or area for people to fill up their water bottles before leaving for the day in the same area as the coffee/dining room. Not having this was a bit stressful. Thanks! Would definitely stay here again"

When I entered the house, I was very amazed when I entered the house and saw the exquisite interior decoration.All the furniture is exquisite and vintage, and my room has two windows with a view of the sunset and the sea.The use of rules and tips is also very detailed.But because I don't know what the word “swive” means, Pual said that he needed to buy a new one to fix it.I'm very sorry."

I did have some issues with check-in (AirBNB error did not send me the access code) but Paul was very responsive and extremely sweet and helpful by coming out to greet me, teaching me how to use the access code pad, and up to the room. The room is upstairs close to the private bathroom which were both large and clean. He said I could use the refrigerator but when I came back from dinner someone was in there with the door closed and didn’t want to disturb them so I did not use it. The back deck is very nice and quiet but there is no real view of the bay or mountains like the pictures show. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, safe, and nice to walk around although it is very hilly. His front garden is beautiful with many kinds of flowers."

The bedroom was clean & comfortable and the private bathroom was roomy with a bath area and a dressing area with a sink in each area. The host also provide a nice living room and dining room for relaxing and eating.
The only drawbacks were there was no television in the bedroom and the Wi-Fi was not strong enough to stream a movie and scroll the internet at the same time. Despite that, if I need overnight accommodations in the Seattle area, I will be looking up this place again. I felt really comfortable and safe, without all the hotel/motel hassles. Thank-you for a wonderful, restful, place to spend the night."

Nestled in the heart of Queen Anne, within walking distance of all the local shops, restaurants and the beautiful Kerry park vantage point, with its views of the Seattle skyline and Mt Rainier beyond. It’s central location in the city also allows you to get to all of the other wonderful neighborhoods relatively quickly. Will definitely book with David again in the future!"

The apartment is around the corner from an excellent coffee shop, a couple blocks from an awesome viewing area for downtown Seattle and the bay, and directly up the Queen Anne hill (oh boy, is Seattle hilly!) from a bunch of restaurants, bars, shops and transportation. It was easy to go south or north from our perch near the top of Queen Anne. I would recommend David's place to friends and would stay there again the next time I'm visiting Seattle."

Stayed a few nights",David’s place was absolutely amazing. It was better than I expected and the photos definitely don’t do it justice. It’s so nice and spacious! David was the most pleasant Airbnb host I’ve had as someone who’s an avid traveler. He was not only willing but clearly wanting to make my stay comfortable and pleasant. He absolutely went above and beyond one night when I needed help with charging my electric car. I’d recommend this place to anyone that I know staying in Seattle and I will most likely stay here again next time I’m here.

We were able to walk (with great views the whole way) down to the Elliot Bay trail, which took us straight to Belltown where our family lives. Walking back up was a bit arduous, but entirely doable for those with ambition or San Francisco hill experience. Would definitely stay here again!"

We didn’t get a chance to open it but it was a delightful touch to have. The neighborhood was absolutely stunning to walk around. David’s place was great for a weekend getaway. Most of our Lyft rides were $10-$12 to get to downtown.

Everything is where you’d expect it, and the space is very well organized. The Queen Anne neighborhood is wonderful, and David’s place is in one of the most walkable parts of QA. The only caveat at all that I should note is that there are two sets of stairs that one must negotiate to get to the apartment, and there is in additional set of stairs inside the apartment to get to the bedroom. These stairs are not rickety or unusually steep, but they might be a concern if you have trouble with stairs. But overall, the place is quite comfortable and quiet."

David is very friendly and responsive. However, with the house manual on the kitchen counter you would not even need to reach out with questions -- all of them are answered already.

Queen Anne is my favorite neighborhood of Seattle. The only issue was they are building condo’s across the street and the workers started at 7a to 5 or 6pm. Street parking is tight but David had a parking pass for us. At times we had to park a block or two away which is common in Queen Anne and no big deal. I feel we should have been advised of the construction/parking prior to our booking but it really wasn’t bad and we were out most of the time. Fantastic weather and a gorgeous city view off of Highland drive, 2 blocks away from the apartment. We’d come back."

Stayed a few nights","David's place is a cozy, two-level spot in the Queen Anne neighborhood. It's easily walkable to several coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants. The unit does have multiple stairs so that could definitely be an issue for some. The bed was super comfortable, the shower pressure was excellent and the place was clean. If you're looking for a modern, chic apartment, this isn't it; however, if you're looking for a comfortable, clean place to stay with all amenities and a friendly host, this is it. The tub was excellent! The bed was super comfortable. As a few reviewers mentioned, there is construction going on across the street and it starts at 6:45 am. The portable A/C unit cools off the upstairs but also blocks most of the noise. This was a good place to stay for value, convenience and rest. Thanks, Dave!"

Stayed a few nights","David’s apartment was conveniently located for a short trip to Seattle. He was a thoughtful host - the kitchen and bathroom were extremely well stocked, there were lots of snacks, and the bed had lots of extra blankets for the nighttime cold! We loved the little outdoor deck to eat breakfast and the view from the bedroom. The fact that it was just a few blocks from Kerry park was also a cherry on top for good views of the city on our way in and out of the Airbnb!"

The apartment was spacious and really clean in an adorable neighborhood. It's just minutes from a little park with stunning views of downtown, and it's close enough to walk to the Space Needle/Seattle Center (about 20-25 minutes). The only thing that could be improved was the mattress (a bit lumpy) but nothing else aside from that. I would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",Great little place to stay. You have your own private entry. The outside steps are frágil and couple of them feel as if they turn when you step on them. So be carful. The kitchen is nicely stocked and David even provide some drinks to enjoy. Thank you for the bottle of wine such a lovely welcoming. If you have a car it can be hard to find parking. But over all it’s a great comfy place and David is a great host checking in on you to make sure things are well. Would stay here again.

David was a great host! He provided information well before check-in and was very responsive by phone/Airbnb messages before and during our stay. He was also very flexible with check-in and check-out time, which we really appreciated. We had a car, so he provided us with a parking tag and even knocked on our door to warn us when we needed to move our car for tree trimming! We had a great stay and would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely private apt in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood. David was communicative and self check-in was easy, especially since we had a late flight arrival. Apt was clean and provided the essentials and greeted with a bottle of red wine and snacks. We didn't have a car and relied on Ubers, Lime bikes, and our legs. David provides a parking permit pass if you have a car. Laundry is in a separate room outside the apt. Neighborhood is full of beautiful houses, a stone's throw to Kerry Park with skyline views, and walkable to great cafes (Koda, Moonrise, Fiore), ice cream , and grocery/drug stores. Not in our host's control, but there is construction of a new condo across the street and we heard light construction (like stones repeatedly dropped in a dumpster) most mornings by 6 am or a bit before -- we were from East Coast, so were awake by then and not too bothered. We would stay if we visited again."

David reached out well in advance with all the necessary details, providing options for a self or guided check-in. We self checked-in seamlessly and parked right around the corner using the provided guest neighborhood parking pass - so thoughtful. We arrived late and hungry to find the kitchen stocked with snacks, wine and cheese. Loved the walkable distance to downtown while being a quick drive to neat neighborhoods.
Overall great value for a couple's getaway weekend. We'll be back."

Stayed a few nights","David's place can't be beat if you are looking to stay in Seattle. Easy check in with a keypad, convenient parking, and snacks and wine were waiting for us on arrival which was a nice treat. David and John were friendly and communication was quick and easy.
There is a cozy coffee shop just a two minute walk away and even more great places within a five minute walk.
The neighborhood is quiet and friendly and I don't think we went outside once without someone saying hello.
The bed and shower were top notch and you have a view of the Space Needle right out the bedroom window.
We came to seattle in part to enjoy the fall foliage and we spent our mornings on the patio drinking our coffee and tea with a front row seat to those fall colors.
This was a wonderful place to stay and I can't say a single bad thing about it. This will be our home base again the next time we visit Seattle."

The place is a 6-8 min walk to the nearest bus stop that will take you to the downtown area, and it's super close to Kerry Park (10-15 min walk), where you'll get a splendid panoramic view of the whole city!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed at David's place for two months and it was a great stay. He was incredibly response to all my questions and helped quickly whenever I needed it. The location is incredibly convenient to neighborhood amenities and has easy access to the downtown area, as well as Ballard, Fremont, and Green Lake. The deck is beautiful and smells like waffle cones from Molly Moon's ice cream. The sheets and towels are soft and the bed is very comfortable—not too soft, but not too firm either. As the pictures show, there's a lot of decor and household amenities (like cookbooks) in the space. I felt like I was staying in someone's home, rather than a guest space. That was cozy, but also meant more to clean and because some pieces of decor were broken when I arrived, I was extra nervous about anything potentially fragile. Overall, it was a wonderful place to stay."

Being on the top of Queen Anne makes for great views and a chance to crack the window to really feel the Seattle weather (which coming from a sunny high desert was a refreshing change). I spent a few weeks here in January and walking the 3 blocks to Kerry park, overlooking downtown and the Sound as the skies cleared after days of rain was amazing. Pizza at Via Tribunali is excellent and a 100 feet or so away. The central shopping and dining district is walking distance. And easy bus routes to downtown. Definitely recommend"

Easy 8-10 minute Uber ride down to the action around Pikes market and even closer to Seattle Center. (easy walk down the hills, we didn’t attempt walking up!) enjoyed our stay and the quiet neighborhood and deck."

Stayed a few nights","This air bnb is in a nice, quiet, & safe area. Kerry Park is down the street & a nice place to get a good view of the water/space needle. Walkable to a few coffee shops/restaurants & right down the street from the bus stop. You get the entire floor to yourself with a private entrance, but there are stairs that lead up to the host's area that can cause noise to travel between the floors. We weren't too bothered by their noise & they respected their noise level in the morning & in the evenings. The bed and pillows are so comfortable! If you're worried about privacy, you're fine. The hosts never came down, not even to retrieve their packages I left for them on the stair landing. If we were to visit Seattle again, we would come back."

Ralph is one of the best hosts I've ever met. He makes sure everything is very clear to you, he answers all your questions and is incredibly kind. You won't really regret staying here.
The location is very good! Close to Kerry park with an amazing view of Seattle and very close to bus stops to downtown. The neighborhood is very quiet. I walked with my husband around 1 am and found it safe to us.
We stayed 3 days and had everything needed to be very comfortable. Autumn just started and we were put a heater in the room, it definitely helped a lot to sleep. It also has a fan and air for the hot days.
It's completely private, we go in and out on our own. We were able to park at the door.
We would definitely stay here again every time we visit Seattle."

There are plenty of eateries and stores just around the corner and the neighborhood is very walkable and clean. It is quite accessible by public transit as the bus is only a few minutes away. The western-themed bedroom and bathroom was a nice touch, with amenities appropriate for a short stay.
Kerry Park, which is only a couple of blocks away, offers great views of the city. The hilly streets are conducive to exercise on vacation. And to top it all off, a friendly neighborhood cat lives down the street and likes to greet pedestrians."

The property was very tasteful done, very comfortable and incredible detail paid to so many little things which made it a better stay than a five star hotel.
I happened to meet Ralph a couple times while I was moving about and he’s a good human being.
In addition to being responsive to changes in my travel schedule, just chatting with him was a pleasure.
It was an extraordinary stay that is indelibly etched in my heart and memory."

Ralph left a great list of recommendations which was greatly appreciated. There is construction right now across the street, which Ralph kindly flagged for me as soon as I booked and honestly I only heard a bit of noise on my last morning. Other than that I slept like a baby on the comfortable bed. The location is an absolute gem with an amazing view of Seattle from Kerry Park less than a 5 mins walk away. Seattle Centre is a short walk down the hill. Having the ability to park and leave the car for a few days was nice. I walked everywhere which was great on the way down but remember that you have to come back via a steep uphill incline. Wear comfy shoes. I had a wonderful stay at Ralph’s and I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We thought it was a great place. Comfortable bed. Room included a heater so we had more control over the temperature. However, if you visit in the winter when it snows, be aware that the nearby bus stop is NOT available because the city reduces the bus routes during snow emergencies. We had to walk several blocks on very hilly streets with icy sidewalks to get to a bus stop. Even with a car, several of the streets were still blocked or very slick (we saw several cars backing down hills)."

They thought if everything to make one’s stay pleasurable. The bedroom has two desks and as many lamps as you could dream of. Their is a clean bathroom as well as a little kitchenette and washer/dryer. Ample room for hanging clothing or dresser space. A short walk to multiple restaurants, grocers and novelty shopping."

Stayed a few nights","Ralph’s AirBnB is a spacious room at one end of a hallway, with a bathroom at the other end. It was private for us, because Ralph was gone during our stay. Otherwise, it does feel like you’re living in someone else’s house, and someone might walk down the stairs at any moment. (You might want to bring a bathrobe for the ‘trek’ down the hall to the bathroom). That said, for us, it felt like we had an entire apartment for ourselves, rather than just a room. It had everything you need for a comfortable stay, minus a full kitchen. We had breakfast ‘in’ one morning, and it worked out fine in the room.
The neighborhood is quiet, with good amenities within walking distance. That said, there is currently construction under way for a new apartment building across the street, which the room overlooks. Work starts at 7:30 am and ends at 5 pm. If you stay over the weekend, you won’t have a problem, but during the day on a weekday, it is very noisy. At night, though, it is quiet, and we slept well in a comfy bed.
Check in was very easy, and Ralph is very responsive. All in all, this is a good choice for the price. I would recommend staying here, with a word of caution about the construction."

Stayed a few nights","The description of the arrangement as a ""COVID safe private apartment sealed off from 2 upstairs floors"" is not accurate. The stairways up and down from the ""private"" area are not sealed by anything except some symbolic obstacles. I could clearly hear everything going on in what I assume was the kitchen at the top of the stairs, and on occasion smell what the hosts were cooking.
Also, at least 3 times during my stay, the hosts had to enter the ""private"" floor to gather something from another room, and the two times when I was there to see it, they weren't wearing masks. So if you're sensitive about COVID risk and don't want to be in a space where strangers are breathing, this is not the listing for you.
However, everything else about my stay was absolutely delightful. I've rarely found an Airbnb so well appointed and thoughtfully furnished. The room was nicer than my own bedroom at home, and I was completely comfortable there. The location was easy to get to and near great restaurants and a park with amazing views of the city. An easy 5 stars if it weren't for the misleading listing text."

Stayed a few nights","My husband & I had such a wonderful time staying at Ralph’s apartment on Queen Anne Hill. Ralph & his wife are both so kind and Ralph was highly responsive! His apartment was clean, comfortable and best of all - close proximity to so much! My favorite being Kerry Park. My husband and I walked to Kerry Park every morning and every night during our stay to start & end our days and it was just the loveliest cherry on top of our first trip to Seattle! We couldn’t have done that had we not been staying just a couple of streets over! There’s also a really great pizza place- Via Tribunali, Donut place-Top Pot Donuts (seriously yummy!!) and coffee shop-Caffe Fiore literally right next door!! Oh can’t forget the ice cream and cupcakes for my sweets lovers! We didn’t get to try the cupcakes but I’m sure they’re just as great as the ice cream from Molly Moon’s! Besides having all of these great places nearby, Ralph’s place has all the amenities you could need for your trip. Bonus- A parking spot in a place that is extremely difficult to find parking (if you’re renting or driving in). Lastly- the price- this is what first grabbed my attention and ultimately made me decide on it. But the comfy bed and the cozy space and nearby experiences & grubs is what’s got me so happy I decided to book Ralph’s! Thanks Ralph for sharing your gem of a spot within Seattle with us!"

Clean, spacious, well equipped, with a really comfortable bed (and extra pillows/blankets), a cold fridge and a roomy closet. Ralph left super clear info/instructions, and the location is amazing; just a few minutes from Kerry Park with its gorgeous view over the whole city and Elliot Bay. The whole area is lovely - a great place to stay. It's got a very local, villagey feel. I met Ralph's neighbours the day I arrived and we chatted lots throughout the week, and people in the local area will get into easy, friendly conversation with you."

Stayed a few nights","In all possible ways, staying at Ralph’s Airbnb was an amazing decision for us.
LOCATION:
- convenient located near a bus stop!
- 5-10 minute walk from Trader Joe’s
ROOM:
- decor is old western, very cute!
- 2 of everything for each person: tables, chairs, bedside stamp with a lamp & outlet.
- AC is 10/10 during hot summer days
- overlooks the street, but trees provide privacy.
BATHROOM:
- very clean and plush bath mats
- separate from room, will have to walk down a hallway
- shower temperature range is good
A word of advice for those considering staying here:
- located in Queen Anne, for those unfamiliar, you’ll be trekking up multiple hills and workout those calves if you place too much trust in google maps. Take the bus, or the long way around.
- as it’s located in a quiet neighborhood, it’s great for 2 friends or a solo traveler, but if traveling in a louder/ larger group, you may want to consider another area.
Ralph and his wife are both incredibly kind and provide amazing recommendations if it’s your first time in the area. I hope you enjoy your time in Seattle just as much as I did!"

Stayed a few nights","Ralph's place was the perfect spot while visiting my brother in the Queen Anne area of Seattle! I definitely recommend it to anyone. It is in an accessible location close to cute coffee and pastry shops, with your own entrance, a nice private room and bathroom with access to a kitchenette and washer/dryer. Traveling on my own, it's nice to know you are in a safe neighborhood even when arriving back late and knowing someone else is around in the home but also having my own space. Everything was super clean, fresh smelling and cheery, and I was glad to be able to wash my clothes mid-trip like I was in my own home. It was very nice to be able to park a car in their driveway too. Ralph was very available to answer any questions and as a nice bonus even installed a new AC unit during the heatwave (most homes in the area don't have AC because of the temperate climate). I'll definitely book again if I'm back in that area."

Location is at the top of a big hill so just down the street is Kerry Park with one of the most amazing views of downtown Seattle you'll find (and free!). Suggest looking up bus times for the Queen Anne hill so you don't have to trek up the whole way if you've enjoyed downtown a lot and are tired. Still, a bit further along Queen Anne are some great places for food, cafe-sitting, and shopping so you don't even have to go down the hill if you don't feel like it. Great place and lovely people hosting it."

The bedroom and bathroom are on their own floor making the stay feel very private. The bed was very comfortable and the room cozy with lots of natural light. Our favorite part was the location - near downtown seattle, located at the top of a hill, two blocks from Kerry park with great views of seattle. There is much to explore just around their home ! Would recommend this stay to others and would stay again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","GREAT LOCATION! If location is the main thing to you then this place is WONDERFUL!
CHECK IN: A bit confusing. Not only could we not get host to answer our concerns about getting in late, we also couldn't figure out where to park once we got there. The #1 spot had a number, but it was not visible in the dark. Headlights didn't shine high enough to see it and it was the same color as the wood. Took about 15 minutes to find the #1 and get parked. Then we had to figure out the two key boxes. We did get in... obviously, but it wasn't what I would call smooth.
NOT SUPER COMFORTABLE: The rule of ""no shoes"" was very understandable with sand from the beach being everywhere. However, the floors were all hard. Even the Living room rug was not soft to the feet. We were a family of 4 and there were really only two places to sit comfortably. Nice looking place, but not what I'd call cozy at all.
AMENITIES: Lots of them! Free samples everywhere were a very nice touch!

I slept better on the bed than I do in my own. I was pleasantly surprised to get to use a weighted blanket and will probably end up getting one for myself!
We tried 4 of the restaurants on the beach within 5-6 minute walk for each. Great food and very friendly staff everywhere we went.
It was a short drive into Seattle, Easy to get to, but we did uber there to avoid parking.
If you like people watching, this is the perfect place. Sitting on the balcony and relaxing watching the beach was fantastic. It can get a little busy, especially since weather was nice, but traffic pretty much stopped after dark.
Overall fantastic experience, I would definitely book again!"

Stayed a few nights","Look no further, stop your search, and just book here. This is, hands down, one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in. The linens are very soft, bed is like an oversized pillow, kitchen fully stocked, nice sized tv, and most of all ... a balcony a stone's throw from water and 5hr sunsets. What else could you want? Oh, there are dozens of restaurants and things to do within a 5min walk. My girlfriend and I relaxed in the patio for hours watching the beach and passersby. The only thing is can get loud during busy/summer times, and you can hear the cars (esp the hot rods) when they go by. But locally they've imposed curfews now and by 12-1am or so on most nights it's a ghost town and you can quite literally hear the ocean from the couch inside. This isn't a ""get away from the world"" spot until it's really late, but it's definitely a happening, clean, fun, centrally located and sunset filled spot. Michael was awesome as well. Just book!"

After a night the radiator did enough to keep the bedroom warm, but the rest of the home remained chilly and for a visit in December it wasn’t ideal. All other essentials were present and the view was nice. Alki in the late fall is calm and this was a solid place to stay for a few evenings."

Stayed a few nights","Michael was very responsive and attentive to details, he checked in a couple times to make sure I was enjoying the stay. The place was easy to check in, very clean and had all the essentials such as shampoo, body wash, earplugs, deodorant and even some wine and energy drinks. This is rare for Airbnbs so I really appreciated the thoughtfulness put into adding little quality of life items into the rental.
Alki is a great area that feels very neighborhoody and safe to be in, even at night. It's also a short 15-minute drive to Downtown Seattle which is great if you want to do things in the city and come back to a nice peaceful stay.
I have no complaints and would easily stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Michael, What a treat to stay in your place! Low key, we were a bit nervous when we arrived late Friday night when cars across the street were playing loud music. But, once we got inside, we couldn’t hear them at all! 😁 Great windows! With all of the extra care to detail, we could tell that Michael truly cares for his guests. The apartment was very clean & spacious. The ambiance made us feel like we were guests in our own home. We totally appreciated the extra value to the romantic setting at the table with wine, the welcoming bedroom, and the choice beverages in the fridge. I totally loved that this dude provides recycling opportunities for almost anything.
You can’t beat the beach view out the front window!! The balcony was a great place to chill. Loved that a sand beach was directly across the street and lots of great food choices were just steps away! If you wanna do a getaway in WA this is definitely the place!! We don’t feel like we missed anything at all by not staying in a hotel suite downtown!
Thanks a million Michael!"

Stayed one night","I frequent a LOT of Air BnBs—this one is the best I have visited!
A fully-functioning loft garage apartment with a Murphy bed. Mattress and pillows were amazing. Plenty of blankets and lighting fixtures. A ceiling fan!!!! The kitchen had ALL of the amenities——ALL!!! A recycling bin was provided. TV had actual channels—not the subscription TV you usually get. Marvelous bathroom and lots of windows and light. It’s quiet and secluded and private. The space has been well-designed and furnished with your comfort and relaxation in mind. The owners obviously love their place.
Walk down to the main road and turn left to get to a nice spot of beach. Be advised that these are not sand beaches; nonetheless, the views are great. Not too many amenities within walking distance, but if you have a ride, it’s a short distance to Safeway, restaurants, and the West Seattle water taxi which takes you downtown to Pier 50, which is walkable to the Pike Market."

Stayed one night","We cannot say enough good things about this Airbnb. My fiancé and I have been long distance for 1.5 years, so we’ve been to our fair share of airbnbs. I wanted to use this trip to to celebrate his new job and birthday a few days prior. Firstly, we were greeted by the host upon arrival. He was friendly and pointed out the two entrances we could use to access the backyard. The backward was absolutely charming. I initially booked this listing because of the quaint kitchen thinking it’d be great for a small dinner or breakfast in the morning. Although we didn’t get to use it, it was well stocked with teas, coffee and even microwaveable snacks in the freezer. That’s a first! The neighborhood was beautiful and within walking distance to the beach. It felt safe and had convenient street parking and/or a equally convenient parking spot. One of the best, if not the best Airbnb we’ve booked. TLDR: charming, private, convenient, well stocked, and walking distance to beach."

Stayed one night","This unit is among the top ten AirBnBs I have stayed in. I recommend it to everyone except those who cannot do stairs. The neighborhood is West Seattle, which you need to know; I like West Seattle very much for the orientation to nature, but you aren’t as conveniently located to downtown — just check out a map. The place is around the corner from the host’s house. On the first floor is a washer and dryer, which is a bonus. You then head up to the living area. It looks like real people use it regularly, and it would be a terrific in law suite. There is a full kitchen with equipment. There is a dining nook. The sleeping arrangement is a Murphy bed more on the soft side (but quality, not mushy or old). The hosts were easy to work with. The parking is not difficult."

The kitchen had everything needed for full meals, and the office space and laundry are big bonuses. Moveable furniture to suit your layout preferences. Surrounding area offered a lovely walk in the woods, beautiful views, and a short drive to nightlife (West Seattle style). Very kind, accommodating hosts. Stay here to feel like you have a home in the PNW treetops."

The Murphy bed was very comfortable, the room had a lot of natural light, was quiet, and very nicely appointed. Very good use of a small but very adequate space. I would definitely return to this special cottage."

Stayed a few nights","We have stayed at Kathy's place several times now, and it continues to be our VERY favorite place to stay. As noted in my prior reviews, the space is creatively optimized and extremely cozy. More importantly (to us), it's QUIET. And yet, you can literally walk out the door, around the block (100 or so steps), and be looking out over the Sound at the Olympic mountains. INCREDIBLE. Everything is clean, well-organized and thought-through, and just where it should be. Oh - and here's an anecdote, to give you an idea of how thoughtful and considerate the hosts are: we stayed the weekend before Thanksgiving, and their turkey was in the freezer in the garage underneath the unit. They called me, and left several messages (I was at a conference, and didn't notice), and waited until I contacted them back, before they came over to enter the garage and retrieve it - just because they didn't want to ""intrude"" (even though I wasn't even there!). Needless to say, SUPER nice and thoughtful people!!! Can't wait to stay here again. :-)"

Stayed one night","This was my second stay, a brief one on my way through Seattle and right after I had stayed forseveral days a couple of weeks before. Kathy's place is excellent for a couple or a solo traveler. The place is a converted garage and the design is very well done. A portion of the 1st level provides the entrance as well as the washer/dryer. Older folks might want to know that there is a flight of stairs to get to the main space, which reminded me of being in the trees. Kathy's place is the most well-stocked AirBNB that I have reserved, the kitchen has almost every utensil and cooking pot/pan that one might need for their stay. And the same goes for the bath. There is small patio area of which I didn't take advantage but I assume that it could be used to enjoy the night air. The beach and hike/bike lane is a short walk from the house and West Seattle is a wonderful place that reminded me of Austin TX back in the ninties. (I haven't lived in Austin since the ninties, so I'm not sure whether it is the same or not.) With GPS, the apartment is easy-to-find and having the West Seattle Bridge closing meant a little congestion late in the afternoon in one spot, but overall I enjoyed exploring the streets of West Seattle. There are tons of restarants, grocery stores and exercise opportunities, as well as a great view of downtown Seattle along the north shoreline. I didn't expect that things would get quiet as early as they did, but it was nice that there was little commotion to interefere with sleep as early as 8:00pm. I throughly enjoyed my two stays and wouldn't hesitate to book it again if I am in the area!"

It's comfortable, clean, and decorated and outfitted with many thoughtful touches. The washer and dryer were especially welcome to us after two weeks on the road. The Murphy bed was easy to set up, and was very comfortable. We slept so well. Other people have mentioned La Rustica restaurant, and we enjoyed it, too. We got take out dinners two nights in a row, and everything was delicious. It's just a block away - an easy walk. We took the water taxi to downtown Seattle every day, and it was very easy. There was plenty of street parking near the water taxi. It was a convenient way to get downtown, and the ride on the harbor was fun, too. I would love to come back when I visit Seattle again."

The water is seriously one block away with nice walking trails, views to die for and areas to sit and just soak up those spectacular views. Very peaceful and quite with quick 1 block walking access to an awesome restaurant (La Rustica-Italian-truly the best Italian food we’ve ever had! Also with views of the sound/mountains) , short drive/walk to a grocery store and other restaurants. The bed is a Murphy bed, but it was super easy to pull down and very, very comfortable.

The Murphy bed was a chinch to set up every night and stocked well with clean linens. One nice surprise was the washer and dryer, while stated in the description, I did not see a picture and thought it was lacking or an inconvenience to use. But indeed, it in the unit and a great bonus for us! Check in could not have been easier. The location was great, we took walks every night and felt safe to be out after dark. The proximity to water was a wonderful treat! Just across the street from a park to view the sound, we enjoyed it immensely. Great experience.

The living room was very cozy, but if there's a larger group with kids I can see that extra room being a plus. Beds were comfy. Overall we felt the place was tidy but it could be cleaner, ie. our linens had pet hair. But I believe the place accommodates pets. A no frills type of place that would be good to use as a base while exploring Seattle."

Highly recommended. There was nice bedding on the beds, but only a small blanket on the couch. If someone plans on sleeping on the couch I would just bring an extra blanket."

There is plenty of space to park and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Definitely the place where we will stay next time we visit Seattle."

Backyard is absolutely beautiful and we had what we needed for our short stay! The only (but large to us) complaint is that the master bed was incredibly hard and uncomfortable. I would not sleep on it again. Maybe a mattress topper would help going forward :) otherwise a very nice place!

Stayed a few nights","Great little place tucked away from the city. Not too far, about 15-20 mins from pike place and other touristy areas by car. The place had very open spaces and was comfortable overall. The kitchenette worked for us in terms of making breakfast daily - but if you plan to cook quite a bit, it might be tricky. The backyard is beautiful, matches the picture and description well. Ample parking space in the driveway. There’s so much nearby in shoreline to do if you prefer to stay local as well. We loved the mix of the city and what the suburban area had to offer. Only thing is that any movement upstairs can easily be heard in the unit so keep that in mind - didn’t bother us though.
Thanks Panya, we look forward to returning again!"

I was able to leave him out there for a few hours while we were away, I was given a cord to charge my vehicle and I was assisted in setting up some streaming services. The home felt inviting and we never were left stranded by our host. The neighborhood was also quite walkable, though there aren’t many places to eat or grab a coffee within earshot. Despite that, I’d highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful, sparkling, comfortable escape from the city of your daily Seattle wanders."

Panya was super accommodating for our needs and went over and beyond our requirements. Pleasantly surprised by the rearrangement and upgraded kitchen setup since our last visit. We love having a wonderful space for our family that allows hosting our Frenchies as well. I don't want to boast too much as I'm afraid we won't be able to stay again due to popularity. 😎
There is some noise from the upstairs since it's a basement unit, but it's not over the top and should be expected. Non issue for us and we look forward to visiting again the next time we find ourselves over on the westside!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my second stay at Panya and Shulin’s AirBNB. I really love the location. It is close to where I need to go for work, any grocery I may need, and plenty of restaurants. The thing I really appreciate is how quiet the back yard is even though it’s several blocks from highway 99 (which has tons of great amenities), the tall pine trees and fenced private backyard make it so quiet and peaceful. No road noise at all.
As it was last time, the apartment is private, very clean and very large. There were 3 of us this time and plenty of room for all of us to have private areas/rooms to sleep. There is plenty of natural light as well as other lighting to use after dark.
We continued to enjoy the movie projection room with plenty of apps to choose from and the ability to sign on to apps with your own user data, if wanted. Panya and Shulin are very responsive to any issues or questions. They were super fast to help with sound issue we caused on the sound bar when we pushed a wrong button."

My family loved the movie room. The kids picked out a movie on Disney+ so we were able to enjoy a family movie night. We really appreciated the clear instructions for turning on the projector, sound, and apple TV.
The location was quiet and convenient for where we wanted to be.
It snowed over our last night and Panya shoveled the walk early after sending me a message so we wouldn't be concerned if we saw a person outside. Very thoughtful!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful stay at Panya’s place. It is well located for everywhere I needed to go in Shoreline and North Seattle for work. The location is close to the freeway and easy to access. Check in was a breeze and Panya was very quick to answer with any questions I had prior to my stay. The space is clean, spacious and perfect for work or play. My guest and I really enjoyed the projector screen movie room which had access to plenty of streaming platforms and I had no problem signing on to my own account for my own saved shows and movies. The sound system is wonderful. Seriously like being in a movie theater. There are printed out step-by-step instructions on how to work the entertainment system. The kitchenette was perfect for me to make coffee and store refrigerated stuff I brought with me. I ate out most evening meals and there are so many good restaurants in Shoreline (Scott’s can’t be beat for a steakhouse), Richmond Beach, and Montlake Terrace. There are multiple different grocery stores close by including a Costco.
I was thankful to have a dedicated work space to finish my paperwork each day. There is a laundry room, although I didn’t use it. The bathroom was spacious and had a nice tub/shower combo. The bedrooms had wall heaters that warmed up the rooms very fast. The backyard is clean and large and fully fenced in so nice if you have a dog. There are two friendly kitties wandering around and cute chickens in front. The neighborhood is quite and has walking trails that are easily accessed as is Richmond Beach. I think the apartment is very well priced for the size and amenities. I will absolutely stay again if it is available when I come over for work or play in the future. Thank you!"

The beds were also very comfortable! It was a quick and easy 15-20 minute drive from everywhere we wanted to visit in the area.

The projector was awesome and we really enjoyed playing games/watching shows on it. Hosts were very communicative and accommodating of an early check-in request. Noise wasn’t really an issue considering the Airbnb is at the bottom level of their home. All in all it was a great experience!"

Laundry mashing and dryer are handy for multiple days staying. Very nice backyard and occasional surprising visit from cute kitties. Internet is fast. We have everything we needed. Did I mention it located close to the Costco and if you don’t wanna drive to downtown the Rapid bus is less than 0.3 miles away. Highly recommended.

Even though there is no AC, the lower level stayed cool during warmer summer days. We feel safe and secure on the property, the backyard is clean and well landscaped, and our dog enjoyed the yard. The hosts are very respectful of our space and privacy, which we appreciated as well. We look forward to coming back again!"

Parking is easy, and access very easy. Our rooms were comfortable with a nice kitchenette and small fridge freezer to help if you want to cook while staying here. There is a nice shower, 1 bathroom. We did not meet our host personally, but she is readily available over messenger. We loved our stay and would happily stay here again at a future date. Thank you!"

Stayed over a week","Lovely spot in a nice neighborhood! We enjoyed our stay with our dog for two weeks here. Space is large enough, the theater room is very fun to have for evenings in. Kitchen is pretty limited but no surprises there. One can definitely make do with the mini fridge, microwave, toaster oven, and dual burner.
Host was accommodating and quick to respond, I think we only ran into her once in person. The neighbors are also very friendly, we enjoyed walking our dog around. We also LOVED having the hot pot and kbbq place at the end of the street, and the Cuban sandwich shop make for easy eating out in walking distance.
Location is about 25 min from downtown, so a bit out of the way if you’re looking to spend lots of time in Seattle, but the easy access to 99 and I5 make all travel pretty simple."
