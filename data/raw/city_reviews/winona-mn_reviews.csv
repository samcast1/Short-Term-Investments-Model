Stayed a few nights","This was my first Air BnB experience. Check-in, building access, and unit access were all clearly and accurately explained by the host.
The unit was clean, comfortable, and had just about everything we could want.
The Exchange is walkable to area coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and a neat little public open space where are musicians performed each night we were there (for FREE!).
I remember seeing something in the descriptions stating there might be noise from the street or possibly upstairs. We were on the second floor and did not experience any noise issues at all.
Great spot.
Great stay.
Well prepared space.

Did not appreciate the response from owner. This showed me that I should always take pictures because owners think the cleaners never make mistakes or slack. Overall nice building, nice bed. Most important I was able to cook a meal.. Only thing missing was IRON!"

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful stay!! We loved our time at the Exchange.
My husband and I decided to take a mid-week escape and drive down from the Twin Cities to Winona to hike and visit with friends + family. We've stayed at different hotels and BnB's in Winona over the years, but the Exchange is the best of them all by far.
Finding the Exchange was very easy and smooth, just on 4th street close to downtown near the levee park. Access was simple - the electronic door codes worked first time, every time. Building was quiet and secure, with super beautiful historic details inside.
The unit itself is gorgeous! The windows are huge and let in so much light, especially because it's a corner unit, with great sunsets and views of the bluff. You feel like you're perched above the street in a really peaceful way. Beautiful floor and finishings throughout. Seriously comfortable bed!!!!
We will definitely be staying again. What an asset to Winona! If you can book this building for your stay - do it!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed the beautiful ""Cozy Casita."" It honestly exceeded our expectations. It was not only clean and comfortable, but generously stocked with all that we needed. Because I knew we'd be cooking most of our means, I brought along my good frying pan and my knives, but I need not have. The kitchen was beautifully supplied and the same can be said of the bathrooms and linen closets. Just bring yourselves! Also, I want to note that the house is nicely located by the lake, as advertised. There are biking and walking trails, and there is a place to rent, quite inexpensively, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards. All of this is just steps from the front door."

We love the area. We were up visiting our son at the Univ of Lacrosse. Quick easy ride across the bridge into Minn. Our family is very outdoorsy and the hiking in the drift less region and walkable paths around the lake were magnificent.
I wish we could have stayed longer."

Stayed a few nights","Mary’s place is warm and inviting, the spaces and items clean and of good quality and condition.
The space is perfect for 2-3 adults. The only interesting thing to note is the bathroom has two doors, one attached to one of the bedrooms and the other that opens into a small vanity area and then kitchen. This door, however, is quite skinny and while not necessarily an issue, it’s worth noting in case anyone requires a wider accommodation due to disability or similar reasons.
The beds are comfortable and the rooms cooled by ceiling fan and window a/c unit, which are powerful enough to cool the main shared space off the bedrooms in late August.
The location is wonderful, just steps from Lake Park and Lake Winona, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet, close to grocery stores, restaurants, Target, etc.
We enjoyed our weekend stay and found Mary very attentive and responsive. We would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to someone who is traveling to the area."

Everything you could need is within walking distance from pubs, restaurants, movie theater, grocery store, and coffee shops. During the day, we ventured to wineries along the Mississippi and in the evening, we enjoyed walking around town. The airbnb was gorgeous! So meticulously designed with great thought and felt like we were at home. I love historical architecture and this property did not disappoint with the exposed brick and beams. The double sided fireplace was a nice touch. Everything was lovely, we really enjoyed our stay."

Adam was so helpful and patient with me, I am new at online dealings and he always responded right away. The home is within short walking distance’s to many things. Has everything in the home to make your stay enjoyable. We especially loved the patio. We would recommend this home with 5 stars and more."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Adam’s place on Jackson. The environment was pleasant & relaxing, minimalist, spacious interior with artistic decor and homey comfort. The kitchen was stocked with all we needed & having the stellar Co-op for groceries right across the street made shopping for provisions a treat. Adam sent a list of favorite places to dine which enhanced our stay. The Blue Heron coffee shop next door is a gem. We enjoyed that morning ritual, and walking along the river at Levee Park. The location was great for us as we attended the Boats & Bluegrass music fest 3 miles away—enjoying luxurious digs over camping! Communication from Adam was the best. He even sent a picture of my shoes I left behind found under the coffee table & promptly shipped them back to me. Top notch service & stellar property! Thank you Adam."

Stayed with a pet","We’d give Adam’s place 10 stars if we could. It is just as beautiful as pictured, well- furnished, comfortable beds and quality linens, completely stocked kitchen, interior and exterior space. The location is perfect for anyone wanting downtown Winona, a block to the Levee Park and flyway Trail, a half block to an excellent co-op, a block to a movie theater, and near to other downtown points of interest. Though Adam mentions the downtown noise and provides brown noise machines for his guest’s comfort, we were not bothered. It’s a challenge to make a home both loft like and cozy. Adam achieved this superbly. A gentleman walking up the street asked how we liked it, saying he’d heard it’s the best airbnb in Winona. We agree."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second of Adam's units that we have stayed at in Winona. This is the most beautiful airbnb we have stayed at. It's as described, but the photos can't do it justice. It's spacious and uncluttered. Adam clearly cares about the unit and gives thought to the furniture and decor and to the comfort of his guests. The last time we were here it was the middle of winter and we really didn't explore the town. This time the weather was superb and we really enjoyed exploring the exceptional architecture and the scenic beauty. A great introduction in season is the Winona Tour Boat. The captain shares so much information and history of the area. The Minnesota Marine Art Museum is a must see. We are looking forward to enjoying more of Winona, and we will most definitely be staying at one of Adam's units."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved staying in this beautiful space! The pictures don't do it justice - the inside is gorgeous. The building is immaculate with every detail paid special attention. It was incredibly clean, well taken care of, and you can tell the owners took pride in restoring it. The exposed brick was amazing! The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals, which we did often. Every morning was spent having coffee on the back deck, even in the rain since it was partially covered. Noise was never an issue for us. There was just enough to do within walking distance, but we also were able to relax inside on our one rainy day. Walking to the downtown was extremely convenient with almost anything you'd need close by (a co-op grocery, restaurants, movie theater, ice cream, coffee, etc.). Blooming Grounds Coffee Shop was just a few blocks away, & we spent several afternoons there with books & coffee. Thanks, Adam, for sharing your home with us! Can't wait to come back!"

This is great spot for a larger group, plenty of room to spread out. Many restaurants and shops in an easy walking distance. If you are not noise sensitive and want to be downtown Winona in a cool building , this place fits the bill."

Stayed with a pet","The space was great—well appointed, clean, and comfortable. Host was very responsive. We would happily stay here again. For others planning to stay here, a couple minor points to mention. First, the bar across the street can get a little loud at night with patrons hanging out on the back patio. Second, while it is a dog friendly unit, you do have to walk your dog a block or two away from the property for potty breaks (host does not allow them to do their business anywhere on the property). This was really only a pain because it was so cold during our stay. Overall, would absolutely recommend, and hope we can make it back in the summer sometime!"

No parking sign in front of the house on both sides of the street, but cars still parked there all day/night long. Turns out (after a $15 parking ticket) the no parking only applies to ONE spot next to the alley. We stayed in the winter and the yellow curb was covered with snow. Thank you Adam!"

Only minor things I would say to be aware of is that the sounds from outside can be heard fairly easily inside the house, but the bedroom we stayed in had a white noise machine which was nice and helpful. Also there is not a designated parking space for the house, but Adam was very helpful and descriptive about letting us know where we were able to park. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again."

Group trip","We loved our stay! This is a beautiful home with the most stunning views of the Mississippi! I cooked Thanksgiving dinner and although it's always tough to cook in a strange kitchen, things went quite well. I did have to bring some specialty items from home like a zester and lemon juicer, most of the things I needed were here. One thing I wish I had brought was an instant read thermometer. The kitchen has one, but it's pretty small, more for steak than a turkey.
The primary suite was large and gracious. We made use of the living room and family room fireplaces. It was nice to have access to a large garage to put our cars in. The downstairs is very roomy and has 3 bedrooms and an office. I do wish there was one more full bathroom, but it was fine with only 4-6 people staying this trip.
They are dealing with some water issues, but I'm confident things will get taken care of. They worked hard to get it ready for our stay, and I appreciate that. We would definitely stay again."

As with any stay had some minor issues, but Scott was very responsive, and nothing that detracted from enjoying our stay.
Love staying in this area! So many great places to go hiking. Just minutes away from Winona, for food and supplies, also some nice coffee shops (Blue Heron and Blooming Grounds are excellent!).

Group trip","Eleven of us held our Third Annual Active Women's Retreat at Scott's AirBNB. The home was so very comfortable with gorgeous views of the fall colors, the Mississippi River, and the night skies. We were close to multiple state parks and trails for hiking and biking as well as a bit of touristy things to do in the nearby cities and towns. The gathering rooms were large enough to accommodate all of us, but there were also several quiet nooks for alone time to read and relax. There were enough beds for all of us to have our except for two. There was ample space in the kitchen for meal prep and serving with all of the necessary amenities. We highly recommend this home for larger groups and would happily stay here again."

Group trip","5-star rental! Our group of 8 had plenty of room, whether it was cooking in the kitchen or sleeping arrangements, the home was spacious and big enough for a large group to enjoy. The view from the deck was beautiful, and the lower patio firepit was perfect for relaxing in the evening. We enjoyed the gaming tables and bar area in the basement, hopefully future visitors will enjoy some of the beverages we left behind. Most time was spent in the kitchen, and the little sunroom off the kitchen was a great coffee spot in the morning. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, cooking utensils, and misc items that you never seem to remember to bring with but somehow always end up needing. I think our group most enjoyed the stereo/speaker system that goes throughout the house, as it was great to be able to plug in a phone and listen to some tunes while cooking and hanging out. Easy/clear instructions from host made it a great stay.
We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely book again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a true gathering house. The open lay-out has the kitchen and eating area opening up to a spacious family room; however, there is a separate living room and formal dining room so that your group is not stuck together all the time in one living area. In addition the walk-out ground level has another family room/game room type space with a bar. Kitchen was well supplied. We needed nothing. Beds were comfortable and linens/towels were hotel-grade. And Scott added a few extras which made us feel welcome. As noted in all the reviews - the main feature is the oversized deck giving you a panoramic view of the Mississippi River. When not exploring Winona, we spent all our time on that deck. And by the way. Winona is a great place to spend a few days."

Stayed with kids","Excellent location with breathtaking views from every room on the main floor. Plenty of space for multiple families, although there are only 2 showers. Excellent communication with the owners; they had instructions and pointers for everything from check in to the fact that cell service can be spotty. Fully stocked kitchen, patio furniture, firewood, etc. to make the experience great. We had an issue with the A/C but I think it was just bad luck that we were the there the first time of the season the system was needed. Overall a good experience and fun weekend.
It did fall short of a five star experience for a few reasons. It's certainly hard to overlook the fact it was 85 degrees in the house when we arrived and the A/C was not capable of cooling the main floor below 78 until we had a night dip into the low 50s. Not many windows open, and you really don't want them open at night because there are loud trains that come through what seems like once an hour. If you don't like very firm mattresses you'd better bring some sort of pad with you. Definitely bring your own pillow, none are great. There is no range hood so the kitchen will get very smokey if any sort of pan frying is done. The grill was not functional, bring your own.
We paid $600 per night for 2 weekend nights...I think we kind of envisioned this large lavish estate with really impressive amenities. The view is nothing short of spectacular but the house itself is basically like taking an average middle class home and multiplying the space by 3."

This place is perfect for a place to sleep - it’s more than I expected at an affordable cost. I’d much rather stay here than at an overpriced hotel! The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and the space was very clean. I hope to stay here again - I hear it gets booked often."

Stayed about a week","I always look for Adams listings when staying in Winona. They are all so tastefully decorated, spotless and comfortable. This unit in particular had a great view of downtown Winona and you could see Sugarloaf from both bedrooms! I loved the large historic windows in the bedroom and the beautiful bookcases throughout the unit. I felt like I was living in a place you see in magazines! This is a very convenient location if not the best location for food and coffee. The only downside of this place is the amount of stairs but Adam clearly points this out in the listing. If stairs will bother you in anyway, or you plan to buy lots of groceries for the kitchen, this might not be your place. I definitely feel like I stayed in shape while I indulged all week in Winona, so it was a benefit for me! I would stay here again, and I wish I could transport the unit to Seattle so I could live there all the time!"

As someone who is a light sleeper I didn't have any issues with the light traffic noise, perhaps in the summer there would be more people out and about being loud on the street late at night but since it was December it was pretty quiet. I appreciated the white noise machine, although we didn't need it.

We come up to visit my daughter, who is attending Winona State, and we're already looking for an excuse to plan our next trip to stay at one of Adam's rentals. They are absolutely beautiful, have everything you need, and are within walking distance of just about anything (or even a bike ride away). There are lots of things to do nearby, but you may not even want to leave the comfort of these units. This unit is up several staircases - if stairs aren't your thing, I wouldn't recommend it, but it was a nice workout for us (the great thing is, Adam has many other units that are ground level). I wish I could stay here forever."

The outdoor stairs are likely tricky for some, but well worth it.

Stayed a few nights","This beautiful loft apartment was better than a lot of the apartments I've stayed at in large cities like New York and Chicago, and it had a much better price tag than you'll find in the bigger cities. Much easier to get around a place the size of Winona, too with plenty of stuff to see and do. If you like the thought of staying in some big city special apartments you might want to try this place; you'll feel like your spending time in a big city without the larger price tag and a much easier and friendlier city like Winona to navigate around."

The bedrooms are spacious and the host provided excellent and thorough instructions. We didn't have any occasion to contact him because he was so thorough! We loved the location - right downtown and next door to a cafe, close to other good restaurants. It was also quieter than we expected, which we appreciated; apparently, downtown Winona isn't too crazy on weekend evenings, at least in the summer. We never heard any intrusive street noise, even though the place is on a main thoroughfare. Would definitely rent from him again."

The high ceilings and large windows in the bedrooms made the suite feel open and airy. In the loft area is an office space that would be ideal for someone traveling for business or a writer. If you plan to use the kitchen for cooking, be aware that the kitchen only has coffee, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Adam was a wonderful host as he responded quickly, gave great recommendations, and was very pleasant. We highly recommend Suite 7 and would love to return."

Stayed a few nights","I traveled to Winona with a college friend for a girls get-away weekend. We were very happy with this unit. Extremely clean, updated beautifully (we loved the bathroom tiles!), and a great location (loved the coffee shop right on the block for my morning latte!). Beds were comfortable and had nice linens, shower was hot with good water pressure!
The unit really is right off a main drag with shops, restaurants and bars. There was a little noise from the bar patio near us in the evenings, but it wasn't super distracting and didn't stop me from falling asleep or anything. It was a manageable trade-off for being able to walk to things so easily when we wanted to.
Adam gave us a great tip on hiking in the area and was super pleasant when we ran into him on the last day of our stay.
I would stay at this property again and recommend it to friends who travel in the area."

Don’t miss out on the fantastic Japanese cuisine restaurant downstairs run by a warm and welcoming Chinese family. (Literally the BEST fried rice I’ve ever eaten!) The apartment was clean and attractive. Host Adam was accommodating and easy to communicate with. Everyone in my stay was able to climb the 60 steps up and down to this 3rd floor loft many times. Advice for future tenants: Before booking this space, consider the mobility of everyone in your party and comfort with many, many stairs. Great stay!"

There was some street noise, which we were warned about and it is a college city downtown, so to be expected. While there is no separate dining table for, we used the island and all worked out well. Thankful for the good wifi -I did get a lot of work done- and the nice tv as well.

My hosts were charming, gracious and had everything needed for breakfast as an early riser before restaurants opened. Loved the coffee, selection of teas, bagels, local peanut butter, and fresh fruit. Within walking distance was Country Bluffs Co-op, and Mid-Town Grocery Store. Other groceries were available at Hy-Vee & Aldi's a short bus ride away.
Restaurants were within walking distance or a short bus ride. Loved the Blue Heron & Anacabi's Little Kitchen
The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets if needed. Dinette in kitchen was perfect for laptop use. Efficiency kitchen had a microwave, toaster oven & hot plate.
Loved that the library and bus stop were 1.5 blocks away & the Winona County History Center was 3 blocks away. Also museums & walks along Mississippi River & Lake Winona. Will definitely be back!"

They left food for breakfast, eggs and english muffins and fruit, 1/2 and 1/2, etc. so we didn't need to go out in the morning, very helpful. The bathroom is a nice size - window but no fan. Our only minor concern was the bed is more of a futon bed and we are older with arthritic joins and so we need a softer bed and we added padding for us to be completely comfortable.
It was very quiet, even with windows open all night. Easy parking and unloading, it is located on the second floor so has lots of great light, plenty of windows. These folks anticipated most of our needs and their place is convenient and easy. We would come back."

In the room, you got everything you need to enjoy your stay plus a lot of foods/snacks.
If you have a heavy suitcase, be prepared to carry to 2nd floor through steep staircase. Yes, Steve assisted my wife’s suitcase.

Very convenient to WSU.
The apartment was super clean, and the hosts provided cereal, eggs, English muffins, milk, and bananas for breakfast. As others have mentioned, the stairs are somewhat steep (it’s an older home with quirky charm) if that’s an issue for you. There is one small parking spot near the entrance, but street parking was also available.

There is great attention to detail in this apartment with a welcome basket and lots of home-like comforts. Milk, English muffins and eggs were provided by the host, as well as a large variety of teas and coffees. Steve and Nan went above and beyond our host expectations by giving us champagne when they found out that we were newly-weds and donuts from the famous local bakery when they found out that we had never been to Winona before. Very thoughtful. Very kind.
Despite having several large local Universities, Winona seemed like a quiet sleepy town nestled amongst the bluffs on the mighty Mississippi. We were only Winona for a brief weekend getaway, but it was a lovely experience. We would like to come to this part of Minnesota again and would like to stay again at the Treetops suite on 7th street."

The neighborhood seems safe though so it wasn't a big deal. Steve and Nan really do a great job with the minor details, such as breakfast provided and coffee. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed over a week","DEFINITELY OUR FIRST OPTION when returning to Winona. The whole experience felt ""welcoming,"" and all aspects of the rental really allowed us to just enjoy our extended stay.
Location was great -- lovely residential neighborhood; rental home is literally steps to WSU campus, and within a few minutes walk to lots of fun spots, including the big park at Lake Winona with bandshell and sports fields and boat house and walking path that's several miles around lake.
House was very clean and well-equipped-- comfy bed, large bathroom, and just cozy.
But best feature is really the hosts -- they put great emphasis on guests' comfortable and enjoyment.
NOTE: steep stairway to the 1 BR unit we rented upstairs -- potential problem for older person or one with impaired mobility."

Everything was clean and in good working order. The building felt very well kept and safe. There is an extensive book collection for the readers. The noise from the neighboring beer garden could be heard in the apartment, but if was not overwhelming and it was over by 8:00. It certainly was not an issue for us. The two minor inconveniences were no dining table or bathroom counter space.Neither of those would stop us from renting this apartment again if we were staying in Winona."

I was, unfortunately, only there for one night. And it was very quiet; no outside noise on the Sunday night I was there.
For anyone concerned about the steps, there are 32 steps (well lit at night) to the top of the building, 4 steps down when you enter the building, then another 24 steps up to the apartment door for both #6 and #7 (they're across the hall from each other). Between the steps are hallways. The inside steps and hallways are carpeted. I did not find all of the steps hard but I also didn't make multiple trips in and out of the apartment.
I highly recommend booking with Adam!"

Great location, and even though there was a carnival going on, parking wasn't too difficult. We also got to watch the fireworks right from our bedroom windows. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting, and if we're ever in the Winona are again we would love to stay again. Communication was also great, and they were very accommodating to allow us a slightly early check in :)"

It's a beautiful apartment in a great location. Easy to walk to everything downtown with lots of shops, restaurants, and coffee places located nearby. This space is considered a penthouse so there are a lot of stairs. It would not be good for someone who has difficulty with stairs. We will definitely be staying here again."

It is right around the corner from a cute coffee shop and walking distance to nearby restaurants… and a nice paved walking path along/across the Mississippi River. We visited WSU, a 5 minute drive away and also hiked nearby Sugarloaf Bluff.
Adam could not have been a better host! From start to finish, he was very communicative, quick to respond and offered nearby recommendations. We highly recommend!"

This unit is spacious and has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and feel just like home. We encountered yet another MN snowfall during our stay and it was so pretty especially at night with the lights leading up to the top units. It’s close to everything- coop grocery store, bowling alley, movie theater, lots of choices for restaurants. We came to town for a college tour at MSU which is super close. Adam is quick to reply with any questions/locale suggestions. His properties have become our “go to” while visiting the Winona area. We will certainly be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a hidden gem in Winona. It is such a unique place. The room is like new, and immaculately clean. It is perfect for one or two people. Yushi was always quick to respond and was very friendly and helpful. She was very proactive in having the snow shoveled and plowed even though I was the only one in the whole place. It was peaceful and quiet. There is a Roku TV with endless channels. There is a ground-level window providing light but there are also blackout curtains so it was extremely dark even in the morning while I was sleeping. There is an individual hotel-like air unit that I was able to control and so the room was very comfortable temperature-wise. There is no kitchen and most of the furniture is of the ""micro-room"" type but for me it was perfect and the value for the price couldn't be beat in Winona. I will stay again."

This was my second different room at this place, and this one was exactify what I was looking for.
It is a snug room for two-- that is super clean and filled with a couple nice little fun surprises (I don't want to spoil anything for you).
The staircase/lobby area is decorated with a lot of cool Winona/Video and is a lot of fun checking out.
The location is perfect and although all 3 of the other room were occupied, it was extremely quiet. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a more unique stay."

Only reservation I would extend would be to anyone who has issues with stairs as the steps to the upstairs (where the main and 2nd bedroom were) are very narrow & steep and could be hard for some one with issues going up and down stairs. There is a 3rd bedroom downstairs with a singe bed if your party only has one person who would have trouble.

Wish we could have stayed longer, it was a perfect relaxing getaway."

The house had everything we needed from entertainment to laundry, and even oatmeal packets for breakfast (great for the kids) and treats/supplies for our dog. The fully fenced-in backyard is great for playing and running around. It was easy to feel comfortable and at home, and communicating with Megan was easy and prompt. Even despite an error on my end, Megan was friendly, flexible, and accommodating. You won't be disappointed."

Stayed with a pet","Such a lovely, quaint, comfortable place to stay. My little family of four plus our dog were in Winona to celebrate my sister’s doctorate graduation, her baby shower, and my birthday.
Megan’s bungalow is a gem and suited us perfectly. It was a wonderful home base to come back to after all of our various days of celebration. Sitting back on a comfy couch, with a drink in my hand and unwinding from the day felt just like home.
Our dog, Ivan, loved the yard and the neighboring pups, he made friends with the huskies, and also the next door collie. He even scored a dog cookie from her mama.
The closeness of the lakes was wonderful for dog walking, and our kids (10 and 13) even went off on their own to play at the play structures for a few hours. We were able to walk to campus for the graduation ceremony.
We would definitely stay here again! Only thing we didn’t love were the ridiculous stairs, but they certainly bring character to the home!
Megan (and Steve) are amazing hosts!"

Stayed with a pet","You can’t beat the location. Easily situated between the small lake and the WSU campus, it’s easy to find but far enough away to where you don’t have to deal with the college crowd. As someone living in the cities, the backyard was huge. Lily (dog) loved staring out the living room window, and there was plenty of room for her. Megan was fantastic… responsive, flexible, and attentive.
The stairs are treacherous, but not terrible. The kitchen is wide open with plenty of space to cook. It’s a great place for 1-2 people, IMO.
The only word of caution I’ll say is that there aren’t many dog-friendly places in Winona so in the winter it would be difficult to have a dog if you’re the type to bring your dog with you to breweries or coffee shops.
Without a doubt though, I will be coming back to this place whenever I need to go to Winona."

Stayed one night","We had a great stay. The location was perfect, near the University, the lake and the restaurants and church downtown. We could get everywhere in just a few minutes. The house is spacious, sunny, lots of rooms with cute decor and places to sit and put things. The upstairs queen bedroom was so pretty and sunny and had a view to the lake and bluffs. We had a great movie and game night in the cozy living room. The TV was really nice and we could log in to our own Streaming services. The driveway was convenient for parking. We made tea and hot chocolate Megan provided and there was filtered water in the fridge. There were lots of nice things available, such as condiments in the kitchen, throw blankets in the living room and toiletries in the bathroom. We felt really comfortable and welcome.
Cons: the house is a historic home and it is sweetly remodeled, but the floors are uneven and the stair to the upstairs is steep, so you have to be very careful going up and down."

We had four guests that stayed and we were all comfortable. I will say this is probably not the best space for two couples as there is only one queen sized bed. The bean bag chair does fold into a bed but it’s tough for two people to fit comfortably. All in all we enjoyed our stay and Megan was very quick to respond when needed!

This was my first time staying at one of Adam's properties, but certainly won't be the last! it was pristine from floor to ceilings, it was loaded with amenities from coffee to bubble bath and everything in between! it was beautiful beyond words, but so cozy, I felt right at home. the stairs ARE quite a hike, as stated in the description, so pack accordingly, but it is SO worth it when you get inside this breathtaking space! Adam was beyond helpful and responsive from reservation to checkout and really assured my stay was as comfortable as possible. location could not be better! close to downtown, but in a quiet residential neighborhood. never once had any disturbances or distractions from traffic, neighbors or other typical neighborhood sounds. I would 10/10 recommend to any and everyone!"

Close to everything you could possibly want or need, but still in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood, for maximum relaxation. host was extremely responsive and gave clear and easy to follow instructions on check in, check out, things to check out locally etc. 20/10 would recommend this property and any others he has to offer!"

There was a great reading chair in the office with good lighting. a large bedroom. We were warned to expect a hike up stairs to reach the 3rd floor so we dealt with that. If you are reading this, be prepared. the kitchen appliances seemed very new, the bathroom looked like it was recently tiled - spotless. The apartment is on a main street, but it is not noisy, and it is within walking distance of the downtown where we found a great restaurant - The Nosh with a fine dining vibe and eclectic menu of tasty dishes. Highly recommend it. We wondered why there isn't a king size bed in the bedroom since there is so much space there. Oh well, still comfortable. We can recommend this apartment for your visit to Winona - a very pleasant city to visit. State Parks nearby plus a nice winery, Elmaro, just across the border in Wisconsin."

We are a lark/night owl couple and this apartment with the office was perfect for us. We also enjoyed the deck. Adam has created a lovely, comfortable and classy home away from home.
Our primary reason for our visit was/is the Minnesota Marine Art Museum, a real local treasure. Now that we have discovered this apartment I expect we will be getting down here more often.

Location is great, only four or five blocks’ walk to Bloedow’s for great baked goods. Easy to walk anywhere downtown, and we used the dedicated parking space for our rental car.
Be aware that this is on the top floor, so three flights of stairs might be a concern for someone not able or used to walking stairs regularly. We had no problems with the stairs ourselves. They are well lit and carpeted."

Adan was kind enough to refund our money even though it was past check in time on our arrival day. It was a kind and generous gesture on his part and wasn't necessary but he did it anyway. We will definitely go back because we will always support hosts who are so gracious and thoughtful.

Adam was easy to get along with and I'm sure he would help me right away if I needed help, but I didn't. I am looking forward to seeing some of his other rentals when I come back to Winona. I highly recommend this place. The third floor thing might be difficult for someone with mobility issues, however, Adam has other places that would be great for people with that issue. This place worked out perfect for me though."

It was as if I was the first person to ever stay there. Everything was as described. It is in a great location with an easy walk to downtown, campus, a grocery store, and bakery. This is rare in Winona as all the hotels are out by the highway. Staying here gave the ability to experience Winona more like a local. Having gone to college in Winona, this is exactly what I wanted. Checkout was very easy as well. No long list of house chores, just be respectful and clean up after yourself."

This penthouse place is not only attractively designed, but very comfortable and fully appointed with all we needed and much more. Everything worked well, and we were even able to get an Amazon delivery easily. The soaking tub, movie watching setup, rooftop deck and separate office (yoga/exercise room) were especially welcome perks. It was just what we needed for a restful, restorative stay in the quiet cool town where I went to college. Host Adam was consistently prompt, responsive and positive when we had to make changes to our original plans. We couldn't ask for anything better! We'll keep looking for this host whenever we come back to the area."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here a couple of weeks ago and came back again. I just love the calm feel that helps me get some work done, but then it's just blocks away from great food, a brewery and the river walk when it's time to have fun. There's often live music downtown which is a bonus. Definitely a great place to work and play."

Stayed one night","Adam's space is a hidden gem in the region. Prompt communication. Easy check-in.
The neighborhood is quiet enough to unwind, yet its proximity to Winona's historic downtown made it easy for me to take a leisurely 10-minute walk to get sushi.
Spacious doesn't do the suite justice; it felt palatial as a single traveler and would be very comfy for a couple or small group.
The bathroom is a true jewel with its standalone tub and tiled shower. Be mindful of water usage if you take advantage of both: my bath became lukewarm as it filled the tub, but the complimentary bath salts more than made up for it.
If you have trouble with stairs or mobility needs, this space might not be the best. Other than that, I'd say if you need a place to stay anywhere near the coulee region to book Adam's listing as soon as it's available. You won't regret it!"

Stayed one night","My husband described this apartment as “the best apartment I have ever stayed in, with the highest ceilings, multiple reading nooks and dimmable lights to adjust”. I describe this apartment as one that I wish I could stay in for a month because I think I would write my first novel in its inspiration. Would def stay many more times."

Stayed a few nights","This was a wonderful place to stay! Very well laid out, and has everything you could need, loved the little touches. Must take a bath in the luxury tub - bath salts provided. I'm VERY picky about beds, and this one was super comfortable, including the sheets (already ordered some of my own!). The private deck provides a great view. Loved the reading nooks. The penthouse is on the top floor, up 44 steps, but it's not bad especially since there's great, relaxing music playing in the hallway. Nice off-street parking spot. Was a bit warm with only AC in 2 rooms, but I managed. Great place, highly recommend!!!"
