Both the living room and dining room where large enough for all 7 of us to sit together.🙂 I was making the wedding cake for my nephew's wedding and was looking for a house with a big kitchen. This house did not disappoint. All the counter space was great!! The beds were comfortable. It was nice to have a garage to park in because it was hot while we were there. Kathy was very responsive any time we wanted to communicate with her. We would definitely stay here again if we needed a house big enough for all the family.

The home was in a lovely and quiet neighborhood. It was very easy to find. The home was spotless and appeared to be a fresh remodel. Very welcoming and comfy.
We would highly recommend staying with Kathy."

Group trip","My family and I all came from different states to Texarkana for a funeral. While it was not a joyous occasion, we loved having The Mockingbird as our base while in town. I would definitely stay here again! It is such a beautiful, cozy place and we felt right at home. The white noise machines in the bedrooms were a thoughtful touch! The neighborhood and complex were quiet and located near lots of great restaurants, shopping, and easy interstate access. We thoroughly enjoyed a dinner at Ironwood Grill - something for everyone there! For those concerned, there was no lingering pet smell or pet hair in the home. If I could recommend one thing, it would be to provide more sofa (or oversized chair) seating in the living room, as it only comfortably seats four adults. Thanks for a great stay!"

Comfortable beds & pillows. There was body wash, shampoo, & conditioner for us to use. Lots of towels available. Nice to have a washing machine & dryer! It was a plus to have a pack n play for our 9 month old to play in while we packed up. PLUS, they have Usborne Books & a puzzle which was great for our kiddos. Highly recommend to anyone staying in the area!"

The townhouse was spotless minus a couple of small stains on the sofa. Plenty of room to walk around and felt safe. The towels were a big highlight very comfy and thick. The downstairs doesn’t get as much air flow but the upstairs air conditioning worked well. This u it does have stairs but they were manageable. I would stay here again if our travels are heading that way!!!"

I had a couple of questions, and she got back to me immediately and went above and beyond the call. The house is beautiful, spacious and very, very clean. Pristine, in fact. Huge TV! really great for kicking back and watching a movie after a long drive. Loved all the pine trees, and the bed was super comfortable. Great view out the bedroom window. Beautiful property."

Stayed one night","Leigh's place was so peaceful! We loved that it was a hobby farm and that there were horses, goats and pigs back by the main house. Leigh was very friendly and said we could come see the animals. We had a little bit of trouble getting in but Leigh was prompt in giving us an alternative code to get in. We were in in no time! The place was clean and attention was paid to every detail. The bed was comfortable - bathroom and kitchen were clean. We had everything we needed. It was quiet and we slept like rocks after two weeks of travel - we needed that! The only thing missing was the dishwasher pod and they needed a new scrubby for doing dishes - but other than that - we loved the place! We would highly recommend Leigh's place!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is a true gem. We loved so much staying at this lovely farmhouse. The farmhouse is so cozy and well decorated that you feel at home right away. Everything is brand new and pristine clean. Leigh put a lot of love to create a beautiful place to spend some days in a peaceful environment. Everything you need to feel like home was there : bbq, coffee maker, dishwasher, laundry room, king size bed. Not to mention a lot of warm attentions like coffee pods, hair conditionner for example.
The place is dog friendly which was definitely a plus for us staying with a pet.
Leigh was very caring and responsive all time. Self check-in was super easy.
Probably our best Airbnb since 10 years.
Thank you so much for hosting us during this week."

I had a couple questions while there and she was immediately responsive, even at a very early hour.

When you walk thru the door the vaulted ceilings just take your breath away. The internet speed was like none other pinging above 90mbs anytime I checked it!!!

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Jamie's Airbnb was a delightful experience, marked by the serene, magnolia-style charm of her countryside property. The setting was private and tranquil. Jamie's warmth and friendliness were evident from the outset. She provided clear instructions for the house and recommended a fantastic local restaurant, Benchmark, which became a highlight of our trip!
The unique opportunity to interact with Jamie's animals - goats, horses, and potbelly pigs - added a special touch to our stay. Each animal was a joy to be around, and we enjoyed a great conversation. The accommodation itself was comfortable, beautifully decorated, and impeccably clean. Jamie's thoughtful hospitality, combined with the peaceful surroundings and delightful animal encounters, made our stay at her Airbnb a truly memorable one. Great choice if you’re visiting Texarkana!"

We did not arrive to the house until after 9 PM so it was dark, and getting into the house was easy, just as per the instructions she had provided. We only used 2 of the 3 rooms but the beds were comfortable. I had to do some work so the desk and chair provided for this were perfect for what I needed, allowing the family to get some rest while I did that (versus a hotel). We checked-out by 9 AM or so the next day, so while we did not spend a lot of time there, our stay was very comfortable, and if in the area again, I would return to the property."

Room to comfortably sleep 5 (6 if they share the full sized bed) for less than the price of 1 hotel suite. With that hotel room, you wouldn't get the plush living room, high end kitchen, and even a garage to keep you out of the weather while moving in. Even though Jessica was out of town during our stay, she was still remarkably responsive and amenable. Do yourself a favor and book this house, you won't regret it."

The house was very clean, nicely decorated and had everything we needed for our stay. Fresh oversized towels, soft crisp linens and super comfy throws. Cold AC, central Heat & fireplace. Washer and Dryer was full sized and clean. A grill on the back porch and we were able to park our large SUV in the garage. It felt cozy ☺️
Thank you again Jessica for being an outstanding host."

When I saw this location I was already stunned! The home was absolutely gorgeous, and the location was perfect. Upon leaving, my husband even said “If we could find jobs out here, I’d try to buy the house and live there!”
David & Christy we’re super responsive and flexible. We needed to arrive earlier than our check in to get ready for the wedding that was on the same day, and they graciously allowed it.
We loved everything about our stay, and would definitely stay again if ever in the area!!

Stayed a few nights","Christy and David's place is a diamond ""Made in the Shade"". The house is beautiful, decorated with really good taste. Everything is well thought out and everytime we needed something, it was there. The place is very quiet and the view is amazing.
Christy and David are very warm, friendly and welcoming people.
Just a little warning though, once you'll get there, you won't want to leave the house and specially the swing on the porch. A place you can easily want to call home.
We'll come back for sure and we really recommend ""Made in The Shade""."

Stayed one night","I’ve stayed in a lot of AirB&Bs and this was at the top of my experiences. Not a single thing is overloooked!! The photos absolutely do not do this place justice!!! This is a charming home with a stunning pasture and pond out back. Every single detail has been thought of and then some. From a personal note with snacks and water waiting for us on arrival, to the linen spray and breast mints by the bed, David and Christy are the ultimate hosts. We were only passing through, but I would love to come back and spend more time here. Time definitely slows down the minute you walk in the door. There is a wonderful sectional for relaxing and the sheets were divine. We loved our stay."

Inside has a basket of toys, a pack-n-play, highchair, toddler tub and potty.
The back yard is huge. When we were rained out the next morning the covered porch and carport was an amazing covered play area.
The host family was very attentive and responded at lightning speed.
Will absolutely stay here again.
*side note: the bed in the first bedroom is made of clouds. Literally pulled back the bedding to see the brand of pillow top."

Stayed with a pet","I stayed here for 14 days. I gave Simon’s place 3 stars because there were a few problems and only one got fixed. First, there was no ac for 4 days and I had to threaten him that I was going to leave and get a refund before it got fixed. Also, whenever I took out the filter it was disgustingly filthy. Next, the shower is cold, maybe lukewarm which never got fixed (because I wouldn’t take off of work to be there during the day), but it seems like this has been an ongoing issue that still is not fixed. On top of everything, the electricity went out for a day (I’m guessing because the bill wasn’t paid) because when I told him it somehow turned back on. Something else I never mentioned was that the washer and dryer wasn’t very good. The washer didn’t properly drain so the clothes were soaked which took hours to dry clothes, so if you need to wash clothes just be mindful of that. There is no maintenance in this house and everything is cheaply fixed. I wouldn’t pay $1800 to stay here again."

Everything was in working order except the outlet by coffee machine but that was an easy fix by moving it to the other counter. Back yard was a good size our dog ran around it a few times to stretch his legs after many hours of travel. I was happy to find a doggie food bowl under the sink. We only stayed one night but the house fit our needs well.

Stayed with a pet","To many, this could be a stylish, comfortable and nice place. It is all subjective.
For us, the space is larger than expected, stylish with decor and coordination. There is one bed in the bedroom, suitable for 2 people. The 2 sofa can be turned into short Fulton beds (but bring your own pillow, sheets and blankets to use them). Simon has everything you need to cook (pot/pan), wash clothes, or make coffee (k cups, non dairy creamer and sugar provided). With leaves and pollens outside, he should make it a rule to leave shoes at the door.
The duplex has many marks on the wall, door and baseboards, perhaps from tenants who didn’t respect other people’s property. Although attempted to vacuum in the common area, there were pollens and soil/dust by the sofa and the more obstructed area. The floor wasn’t mopped properly, and both the floor and the counters (including the nightstands) were sticky.
Get a better housekeeper and it should still be a comfortable and nice place."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at this place for 4 nights. The place looks exactly like the pictures.
Pros:
- good location. Walmart is literally 2 minutes away(driving)
-The place is super tidy and looks just the pictures
-The bed is extremely comfy
-host is very responsive
-For the price, it is an amazing deal.
Cons:
- Has a little bit of a animal smell (it is pet friendly so perhaps that is why)
- The countertops were sticky and seems like were not wiped down.
-The floors were sticky. I had to use my flipflops to move around the house. I would not recommend walking barefoot unless it gets cleaned.
-The hottest water that comes out of the shower is warm, i usually prefer water to be a little higher in temp but it was not that bad.
Conclusion:
-for the price , it is very good.
Would i come back here?
I would if the floors and countertops gets wiped after every guest!
This is my honest review. Thank you Simon for letting me rent out your home for a week!"

Stayed a few nights","This space was absolutely perfect for what I needed! I’ve stayed at a different unit of theirs before and both were wonderful! I saw some reviews mentioning the backyard which I didn’t need for my stay but I checked it out and the grass was mowed and would have been perfect if I had a pet with me! I also saw a review about the thermostat and water in the shower which both worked absolutely fine but you have to hold down the up or down on the thermostat until it blinks and then you are able to change it, it’s not locked! The bathtub is just backwards, cold is hot and hot is cold but it functions perfectly if you treat the temperature that way!
Again it was a perfect stay! Especially for the price it’s better than any hotel in the area and at a far more affordable price!"

Stayed with a pet","This home was clean, easy to access, and in a decent area. If you just need a safe place to stay for a night its ok, but not great. It is summer time and although the information left inside the house said that we could control the AC from the thermostat, but it was locked at 73 degrees. Also, there was no hot water in the shower. The kitchen and bathroom sink both had very hot water, but the shower did not. Not even warm. Just cold. The handle would not turn all the way over to the hot water side, almost as if it was somehow altered to not allow a hot shower. The listing for this home also stated that it was pet friendly and has a private back yard. This was true, but there was no back door that led into the back yard. You had to exit the home through the main door and then enter the fenced in yard which had not been mowed so we were worried about snakes."

Stayed with a pet","Simon was very kind and responsive. The place had some dog hair, but what can you expect staying in a pet friendly spot. It was clean otherwise and smelled clean. It seemed to have all the amenities you could need.
The backyard was completely overgrown and unusable. I contacted Simon who responded immediately and stated there was an issue with his lawn service and it was cancelled last minute before I came. It happens, but it was inconvenient since my two dogs needed to run before our road trip. It was why I rented this particular spot. I will say Simon refunded me $20 without asking. I also found a dog park very close by. I think it should be noted that the backyard is accessed through the house side fence, not through the house.
Overall the place worked for an overnight stay. I think my issue was not a frequent one."

Stayed with a pet","I stopped by this home w/ my pup just for one night and was very happy I did. The driveway is perfect for easy loading/unloading and the house was neat and tidy, just like the pictures.
I was surprised no one had really mentioned the yard so I'll add some details for fellow outdoor lovers and dog parents. The yard is indeed completely fenced in, you enter through the driveway, it is not connected to an indoor entryway. There's a paved patio area with a small table and then you walk down a couple of stairs (which are sturdy but a high rise) - where there is a very lumpy, but fenced in yard. My sniffing dog enjoyed the space, she immediately had her head in a hole, I'm not sure who lives in there, but I just put a stick over it to deter her. :)
I slept very comfortably in the master bedroom where there's an L-desk and a shelving/wardrobe use for longer stays. The bathroom was clean and the towels were plentiful.
Laundry machines are there- but it is BYO Soap. Overall I was pleased."

Stayed with a pet","We really appreciated that Simon let us check in a little early between our ring times at the dog show so that we could unload while it was still light out. The duplex was very roomy and inviting. I did have trouble trying to get a message through the Airb&b site as I’m technically challenged and my phone wouldn’t pull up on my phone when I was there. I’m sure Simon thought I was a crazy person when I decided to just go outside and ring the doorbell and talk to it. I hope he got the message sooner than later as on Sunday we noticed that the pipes under the kitchen was leaking quite badly. We did what we could to mitigate any damage. For us, it was a bonus as there is a Catholic Church right across the street. We were able to attend Saturday Mass and actually enjoyed the 7am church bells. Our little fur babies enjoyed having space to run around after spending most of the day in a crate at the dog show. Thank you very much Simon."

Unfortunately there were a few things that should have been replaced . I stayed there two nights and there were no tissue, they failed to give us a whole roll to start with, also the main issue was the shower. NO HOT WATER. This was a major issue because it’s not summer and besides I like hot water to shower so that’s a big thing. Please fix before other people rent out this unit. Other than that everything went smoothly. With The washer you have to restart it a couple times bc it stops. Nice stay, great location and decent price. I’ll stay again once they fix the water and get more tissue!"

So if you want a nice cozy clean and pretty place to stay Simons is it. I never had a problem with neighbors. The only negative I'd have to say is I'm a claen person so i usually take my own cover and clean the place when i get there and before i leave. The cleaning fee has gone up it seems. This time it was as much as the rental. So for one night this time was costly for 14 hrs. Ill stay again."

Stayed one night","Honestly one of the nice guest houses I’ve been in. And to a point where I didn’t feel like I was walking on egg shells. Every item was selected to match the decor. But I think they understand, their guest come from all over the country. The bed was comfy. They didn’t have a dedicated desk, instead they had a mobile end table. And several seats. There were 2 TVs. Didn’t turn any on as I was tired from driving. I say the coolest accessory they had was on both night stands. It was a standing surge protector with standard outlets and USB-C ports. It’s little things that matter, and they nailed it with this guest house."

Stayed a few nights","If you need a place to stay in the Texarkana area, this is where you want to be! Skip the hotel and save your time looking at other airbnbs, just go ahead and book Sherena's place. It is way worth it.
The location is fantastic. The place itself is in a calm and quiet area, but you are easily 5-10 minutes from the freeway, shopping, grocery, and anything else you could need.
Before I ever got to the airbnb, Sherena provided clear check-in directions and was easy to communicate with. When I got to the place, I was BEYOND happy with it. It was clean, cute, modern, and super spacious. Sherena goes above and beyond as a host (even providing water bottles and coffee extras at the coffee bar!).
There are plenty of chargers and outlets available, which saved my butt traveling from out of state and not having the brick for my phone charger.
All in all, I highly recommend Sherena and her place! A++, I would ABSOLUTELY stay here again!!"

I am an avid traveler, stateside and globally. I have stayed in Airbnb homes all over this country and all over Europe and the Asian Pacific - I know great when I experience it.
This place is great!
When I say this place is great - I mean, it was perfect!
Sherena's Airbnb, Twice as Nice, is better than a 5 ⭐ hotel!!
The area is pleasantly quiet and peaceful. This guest home is conveniently located to fuel, restaurants and other sites within just a couple of miles of Interstate-30.
I prefer Airbnb homes over hotels; always. This one is tops- no other way to put it. There's not a hotel in the 4 states area there that could tip this place!
I promise you will NOT be disappointed!
Sherena is kind and helpful, completely on top of everything, and definitely knows what she's doing in the world of hospitality management!
5+ stars from me! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Stayed one night","would 100% recommen staying here, for the price I think it's unbeatable, especially on airbnb, I've paid way more for way worse. the location is safe and out of the way, so me and my fully packed car were safe from potential robberies, and the inside was immaculate, I was so pleasantly surprised I can't recommend this place enough."

Stayed one night",Enjoyed our stay for our anniversary visit to Texarkana for a dinner & live music in the area. All very convenient to guest house location. Decor is top notch. Sherena recommended a local restaurant we would have never discovered that was spot on for special occasions. Extra touches were provided that were personal & thoughtful on our arrival. Would love staying there again if in area.

Stayed one night","We used Sherena’s place to get a jump start on a long cross-country trip from North Texas to Rochester, NY, with a fully loaded car. We needed secure, off-road parking. The neighborhood was perfect. Everything was just as described. It was quiet and comfortable. The bed was so great, I plan to order one like it.
The guest house is adjacent to the hosts’ home. They were very responsive.
The property backs up to a wooded area. We spotted a young wild cat making its way across the back of the property in the morning.
We were happy to find a place that allowed a single night’s stay. It was a bonus that there were no stairs involved. We were very comfortable."

We had little dogs with us and loved having a nice grassy yard to walk them in. They had plenty of chairs to sit in while we were waiting on the pups to finish their business. The home smells clean and fresh and we made sure we put britches on our kids, so there were no accidents.
We felt very safe and the neighborhood was nice and quiet.
We found a delightful restaurant call the Twisted Fork a short distance from Grace Haven. A must to eat at!!
Overall this was the most relaxed I have been in months!"

Stayed with kids","This is the 3rd time I've stayed at Grace Haven, but the 1st time as the main renter. I've found the home pleasant each time! it is always clean and smells nice throughout. It looks the way it is depicted on the listing and is even more spacious than you are expecting! The amount of kitchen supplies is amazing and perfect for any meal you may want to cook! Communication with the hosts is equally as pleasant! Upon arrival, the evening before Thanksgiving day, we had a small hiccup and contacted them about it immediately. A few minutes later, we received a response saying someone would be there in 15 minutes! Their housekeeper arrived to help us since they live a good distance away. She was the sweetest for coming over so late in the evening before a holiday! Even my toddler loved her! I highly suggest this home if you're in the area! You'll have plenty of room and won't have to worry about a thing with such helpful hosts! I'm sure we will be back 😊"

Stayed with kids",The house overall was very nice. It’s quite big and the pictures they have on their listing doesn’t really show that so I was pretty happy with the overall size of the property. We met Roy and he seemed nice and asked us to turn on the sprinklers Periodically during our 2 week stay. Also the master bedroom was very comfortable and our son seem to like the guest bed. We did notice one of the beds in the house looked like it had a broken mattress but not sure if that was the case since we didn’t use that room. The internet 🛜 wasn’t as strong as I wanted it to be. Both my husband and I work from home and need a strong signal and a lot of the times our laptops would disconnect. Screen mirroring was a hassle. Due to the WiFi signal the tv wouldn’t want to connect to it sometimes and sometimes it did. Also their is only one tv in the house. But that wasn’t a big deal. Overall very comfortable stay.

The neighborhood is relatively quiet, but the house is located close to a Main Street with a lot of traffic so it is dangerous to let the dogs run off leash without a fully fenced yard. I wish the picture or description would have noted that. The house itself is big and spacious, very clean and the bed is comfortable."

The hosts really thought of everything and there was even a selection of free movies to watch. The house was m clean apart from the main bedroom which was only because the cleaner had an emergency and didn’t let them know they wouldn’t be coming. No one’s fault. There were plenty of other beds to choose from so it wasn’t a big deal. Thanks for a lovely stay and would highly recommend!

Stayed one night","This was a wonderful home. So comfortable and roomy. We were on our way back home and it was just an overnight. We didn't use any of the appliances, but they all looked to be in great working condition.
The bedrooms are large and well appointed with high end linens. Slept very comfortably. Each has a remote control fan which was great too.
The kitchen is large and would be great to cook large meals for family or whatever you choose to do. It was very clean and had natural light. There are several local eateries and coffee shop within a couple of miles of the home.
There's a breakfast nook area as well as a more formal dining room. I really like that as we are a smaller family and I like the less formal setting. The formal was beautifully done.
All bathrooms were sparkling clean and well supplied. Great hot water and fluffy towels.
The yard is beautiful although it was dark when we arrived. Had we stayed longer, I know we would have thoroughly enjoyed that space too. Neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.
Great hosts were attentive and welcoming. They communicated well and were gracious to host us without much notice. Really appreciate their hospitality. I will definitely rent again when in the area."

Light in kitchen only worked occasionally making kitchen very dark and stove hood light didn’t work. No extras like sugar for coffee.

The shower in the master and the bathtub in the guest bathroom needs some attention. The faucet in the kitchen and the faucet in the master that is closer to the toilet is loose.

Group trip","Very affordable and high value for the amount of space and a good and safe location, but furnishing are dated and we found it difficult to feel comfortable. The house is in need of a deep cleaning but was not cluttered and was acceptable. Overall, I would still recommend."

Stayed a few nights","When you open the front door you immediately feel at home! Every room smells delightful ! Kyle’s house is very spacious, open and roomy! Every room in the house is large and spacious . The backyard was inviting , relaxing, and great for grilling and hanging out! I personally enjoyed the backyard and patio the most! We had a small incident with the grill in the backyard and messaged Kyle ONLY to let him know and he responded immediately and told us he was bringing a new grill. Even though we told him he didn’t have to do that he came right over with a new grill and new full bottle of propane. He was a pleasure to meet in person and very friendly. The neighbors are friendly too and really nice! I would highly recommend staying at Kyles house and we would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed with kids","Overall a nice place to stay, good area, convenient Walmart grocery nearby. We were in town for a softball tournament and the fields were close, also some touristy type stuff within 20 minutes. However, there were a few minor inconveniences. For example, there weren’t enough towels although there were signs saying extras were located under cabinets, closets, etc. but we couldn’t find any. With 2 adults and 3 kids, we had to wash towels twice during our 4 day stay. The cookware and utensils were difficult to locate at first as items were placed in random cabinets and drawers. Once I did my first load of dishes and started putting things away, I was able to locate additional items and we ended up having enough for what we needed. The large, fenced in backyard was a big plus for letting the kids play while grilling on the patio. I will echo a previous reviewer and say the master sink closest to the shower has a clog, but the large bathtub was nice and convenient for bathing little ones."

Pros: Hosts were friendly and answered any questions I had quickly. House is large and spacious, was great for our family! It’s pet friendly so our dog and my in laws dog were able to join us.
Cons: The cleanliness was below what I was expecting after reading the reviews. I’m not sure if we got an off week but it was clear just a quick surface clean was done. Floors and baseboards were dirty, and the counter in the main bathroom was dirty behind the decor. Food was left in the freezer and dishes and cups were sparse.
Overall the house met our needs. Thanks!"

Group trip","This place seems like it was a little bit older, which in and of itself is fine. However, this place seemed a bit rundown. There was wallpaper peeling in the guest bath along with various stains on the walls, tub and tile. One of the sinks in the master drained very slowly, seems clogged. There was a terrible smell coming from the kitchen disposal like something was rotting in it.
There were also some small issues that were inconvenient. For example, we weren’t provided with the WiFi network name and there were many potential options. Combine that with the fact that the WiFi password printed on the sheet was not the same as the one on the fridge and we had to spend a bit finding the right combo.
There was food left in the fridge, but there was no indication if it was meant for us to use, if it belonged to the host or if had been left by previous guests.
This place has potential. It’s spacious and has a nice backyard. With some minor improvements it would be really nice. However, when I compare it to other Airbnbs I’ve stayed in, it just doesn’t measure up."

Stayed one night",I loved this little place - a cabin in the woods. It was peaceful and very secluded. I felt safe and secure and slept like a baby. I love the privacy and the private drive onto the property. It was very easy to find and it was so cozy and quaint and cute. It was like a little dollhouse. I would definitely stay there again. I also like that it was on the first floor and there were no stairs to climb. Chris had it stocked with toilet paper and with coffee which was a definite plus and the mini split kept it cool inside and the bed was extremely comfortable. I love the mirror in the bathroom because I could get really close to it and put on my makeup and I love the small table on the bed for reading my book while in bed. the light was great too and I felt that I was at home. I forgot to bring my pillow from home however Chris had very comfortable pillows so I didn't miss mine. Thank you for having such a special place. I will come back again.

The small casita/ tiny home listing was like stepping into a western movie: all wood interior, with all one needed for a short stay. Separate from the beautiful stucco house in front , it offered complete privacy
Cotton sheets and non chemical cleaning products checked my box!

Stayed a few nights","Chris and his wife have really made a beautiful country style home to stay in. The moment I got there, it felt very peaceful. The city is right outside their property, but they are surrounded by lots of huge trees. I felt like I was in the woods. Every morning the birds go crazy sining. There is a really nice place to park. They have enough security to provide safety, but not overwhelming to where you feel spied on. There is a cute path to walk into the cabin. Everything was on point with the country theme. The dishes, lights, bedding, and the huge claw footed tub. The water is hot and stayed hot. It is cozy and everything was clean. Tons of natural light during the day. The best part is meeting their sweet dog Birdie. The location is super close to Walmart and food places. The hospital is even 5 minutes away. Several awesome flea markets 2 to 5 minutes away. Through the whole process Chris was super responsive. I hope I get to stay again sometime. Thank y'all!"

Would be happy to book if I’m in the area again! This little home is surrounded by what feels like a peaceful and beautiful surrounding forest. On top of the simplicity and rural nature of the stay, one of the main things that drew me to Chris’s place is that healthy cleaning products were used. It’s tough to find an Airbnb that doesn’t use toxic products and it’s obvious him and his wife have put in a lot of care and thought in crafting the space to make it so much more than that."

Climate control worked great, hot water worked perfectly, and everyone was comfortable. The kitchen was spacious, two dining rooms to choose from, one big enough to seat 8 people for dnd comfortably. The host was extremely helpful and responsive. 5 out of 5 for the house."

Group trip","We love staying in the Pecan House. This was our second time staying there, and it is a great place for our family gatherings. We love the fireplaces, really helped keep the house warm during the 20-degree nights. There was ample space for seating in the two dining rooms, and bedrooms offered plenty of space for us to sleep, with comfy beds. We did not have to ask for anything, and the host has always been very responsive during previous stays. My family always requests that we have our holiday gatherings at the Pecan House now! Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful, historic home with us. We will be back."

Stayed a few nights","Pecan Properties is exceptional!! What a beautiful and well appointed historic home in Texarkana! The owners have left no stone unturned in considering the comfort of their guests. Our family is a return guest stay to Pecan Properties and we would not imagine choosing any other host in this area. They are consistent! The home is stately yet has a homey feel. There was plenty of room for our family of eight. We hosted our Thanksgiving dinner in the home. Not that it was their job to provide the extra amenities but literally nuisanced things that I forgot and ran to the store to get, I later saw in a cabinet - ex. nutmeg. There is even a nutcracker in the kitchen drawer!! The details are unmatched, but the service will overwhelm you even more. Not only was the house responsive, but the supporting team is right there in the city and they go the extra mile to ensure the comfort of the guests as well. #GoldStandard Thank you for an amazing stay! See you next time."

This home provided a wonderful space for us to gather for meals and in the living space to visit and talk. The 5 bedrooms were spacious and comfortable - giving private space as well. The bathrooms were great also. Loved the front porch with rocking chairs. The location was good in that our events were all close by. The host was very responsive and quick to answer any questions we had.
If you have a large group/family, I highly recommend this home!"

Group trip","Our family brought this house back to life after it had been condemned by the city in 1980. We owned it and LIVED ALL OVER IT AND FILLED IT WITH LOVE for about 10 years when we sold it. It could not have been more special to spend another weekend in it after a few decades between our last time in it. The new owners have done a beautiful job with it! It could not be more beautiful nor a more perfect venue for our weekend. Great accommodations and very responsive hosts. On a scale of 1-5, it gets a full 10 stars! Beautiful, clean, easy instructions, very accessible hosts…I could go on for days! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! I might have to concede that my emotional attachment could be at play in this review, but to whatever extent that is possible, I would still have to say that we have rented other homes in other cities and have not been as happy overall as with this experience. Book your next Texarkana trip soon and stay at 1321 Pecan St on the Arkansas side and see for yourself!"

Absolutely breathtaking! Hosts were amazing and are very responsive and helpful. They even include recommendations for everything you can think of. The kids had a blast exploring and opening every door to see what was behind it haha! The layout of the house is intriguing and I would love to learn more about this house and it’s history. If we ever come back down to Texarkana, this is the house we will definitely try and book! Oh! And the hosts have a journal where you can write a little something about your stay as well and people can read! Thank you so much for hosting our family and we will be back!!"

It’s very well maintained and decorated, and there were so many extra amenities like the coffee bar in the cute pantry, dishes, plates, utensils, spices, and some condiments, to name a few. Everything we needed to cook Christmas dinner was there! We enjoyed it so much and had perfect communication before, during, and after. We stayed during a very cold weather snap, and we were provided tips on what to do. Fireplaces worked well along with central heat.
James answered all our questions quickly and was super friendly and professional. He has multiple homes in the area and his care and attention to detail are evident in many ways. We were all impressed not only with the house but with his management of it.
We only slept in the master. The bed was very comfortable, with plenty of extra pillows and blankets provided. We also watched the tv’s using Netflix. Can’t say enough good things about this place! Loved it! Would stay again!"

Everything was so neat and clean. the master bedroom that my husband and I stayed in was to die for really nice comfortable bed we didn’t even want to get up in the morning. also really nice rooms for my kiddos each equipped with flatscreens and several entertainment platforms ie: Hulu, Netflix, Roku etc… The house had a washer /dryer which was so convenient traveling with little ones. the kitchen had everything you would ever need and more. James was very responsive and accommodating to anything we asked or needed. I can’t even explain all the greatness in this one message but I HIGHLY recommend this place.

I sent him a note and he immediately reported to the power company and shared back the ETA with me. But THEN...he went the extra mile and had flashlights brought over for us. Even inside of what was clearly out of his control, James was amazing every step of the way. Can't wait to return."

Stayed with kids","A beautiful house from the early 1900s, with all the common amenities. We came during the cooler months and took advantage of the gas fireplace. There is an amazing wraparound front porch with plenty of seats along with two amazing rocking chairs.
The bedrooms were good size and had all the needed items, to accommodate our needs. We were attending an event and there was even an iron to press our clothes.
The kitchen was stocked with more than the typical Airbnb, which any chef would be satisfied. They even have a super cool pantry with a coffee maker, which actually included coffee and filters.
The house is near restaurants and breweries, most things aren’t more than a mile away. We really enjoyed Johnny B’s for breakfast and the libations with live music on Saturday night at Redbone Magic Brewing.
We would stay here again and hope to in the near future."

The rooms are spacious with a beautiful backyard my kids liked to play in. The location is close to plentiful fantastic sites in Texarkana, like the Hot Springs we visited. The downtown area close by was also an amazing place to walk around and experience life in Texarkana. We definitely enjoyed the restaurants with delicious foods to try there, too."

Veery prompt responding and coming right over to light the fireplace because my skills aren’t up to pare. I loved sitting in the dining room every morning reading the news on my iPad with the fire going. My son wants this home to be our vacation spot each year. I can’t say enough about the beauty of this home. I was ready to move in myself. Lol. I’ll definitely be back. 5 stars doesn’t rate high enough. James deserves a 10."

Stayed one night","James’ gracious home was a wonderful oasis to stay in after a long day on the road. It felt a bit like entering another era — immersing ourselves in all the cool details of a full and well-lived existence. We loved the antiques, the old books, the many idiosyncratic parts of a century-old house full of nooks and unique features. Our girls explored all the parts and then holed up in their favorite bedroom together. The beds were so comfortable, the shower delightful, the towels thick. We enjoyed having take-out at the beautiful dining room table and admired the well-stocked modern kitchen with all the amenities. I wished we could have stayed another couple of days just to soak it all in (or get to cook in the fabulous kitchen!). Unlike some other AirBnb’s, which are cute but not really lived in, this house has *amazing* personality and a fascinating long story to tell.
For those visitors who like to run, we thought the nearby neighborhood was also interesting, near enough to a creek trail for a good longish jog. In the morning we got to drive through Texarkana’s charming downtown and then had coffee and danishes at Brewster’s. We hope to be back!!
Thank you, James, for your lovely hospitality."

The Dogwood in the front yard was in full bloom and all the Japanese Maples were lovely. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you would need. There were even condiments in the frig. We would definitely stay here again. The coffee maker is a Mr Coffee, no Keurig. The light switch to the front dining room is by the front door (it took us a while to find it) and coffee mugs to the left of the frig. Just be aware that the neighborhood is in transition. There are real nice homes like this one and some that are run down. But we felt safe and would return in the future."

Stayed a few nights","The home was not just beautiful, and extremely welcoming and comfortable, but fascinating. It was like a movie set, with genuine southern charm, all the amenities I could have asked for, and a quiet, easy access location. I'll definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","This amazing historic home is filled with treasures. Every piece of furniture is perfectly proportioned for the rooms. The decor is coordinated for the style of the home.
Our visit was in the middle of a winter storm, and the host made sure we had everything we needed to comfortable. He was immediately responsive to every question and request.
This is my new favorite place to stay in Texarkana."

Stayed one night","I couldn't have asked for a better place. The home was beautiful and comfortable at the same time. There were unexpected and very thoughtful amenities to make our stay feel like home away from home. James is great at accommodating as well as communicating. Whether using this home or another, we will use James again when the opportunity arises."
