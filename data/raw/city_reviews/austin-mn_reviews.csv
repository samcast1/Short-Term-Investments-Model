Stayed one night","The renovated church was a beautiful place to stay and had everything we needed for a very comfortable overnight. It was also VERY clean, which was so appreciated! Sheryl was super nice and offered to help us with anything we needed. We would definitely stay again if we found ourselves back in the area. Just for clarification, there was some sort of basement unit (apartment, maybe) that seemed to be occupied, as we could hear a toilet flushing, some dishes clanking and a voice. There was also a camera inside."

Stayed a few nights","This place was awe inspiring. More impressive in person than even the photos can show. Sheryl has done wonders with the transformation of this old church. But it is not just all show, very comfortable bed and couches, great kitchen, great bath and shower and many amenities we didn’t expect such as wireless chargers, adjustable bed and wonderful sound system. All in all this was one of the best airbnbs we have visited, we really loved it."

Lots of history makes the building interesting, and everything in the place is top quality. It is close to Austin and Rochester. It is very quiet and comfortable. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Minnesota."

The house is roomy, beautiful, and comfortable to live in. There were many thoughtful “extras”, like the cold water in the refrigerator after our long day of travel, snacks in the bedrooms, toys, books and puzzles. And the hosts provided us with necessary items for the baby—pack n play, booster seat, and baby toys. Thanks will for making this home available to us!"

Group trip",Home was a fun place to stay with great decor! Easy to find and instructions were clear. Fridge didn’t have waters in it like we were told so we ran out and grabbed our own. No extra toilet paper but host was very responsive on that and got it to us right away. Lots of cobwebs and a little dusty but felt pretty clean overall. Beds were very comfy and bathrooms were nice and accommodating to our group. We appreciated the reasonable rate. This place provided private space for multiple family members but also cozy gathering areas for us to visit.

Stayed a few nights","I hosted a girls' weekend at Brie's home. We loved the decor - a combination of antique and contemporary. We had fun with the older items, some of which reminded us of our homes growing up. The home was within an easy walking distance to downtown Austin, where we visited the Spam Museum and a wonderful independent book store. We also ate at the Downtown Grill. The home was clean and well supplied. We especially appreciated some of the small touches, such as sound machines and fans in each bedroom. Communication was great and the host responded very quickly every time. And with 4 of us staying there the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend Brie's home as a place to stay if you are in Ausitn!"

We typically travel with sound machines for our kids, but had only brought 1 along. I loved the added touch of having sound machines, fans and power strips with USB ports in every room! I would definitely recommend Brie’s place!"

Group trip","This house was a fun and creative place to be for the weekend. Plenty of room for the 8 of us to sleep and relax. The front porch swing was great ☺️. There were little touches that made it stand out from many other homes where we have stayed: water bottles in each room with a snack and mints; and hot beverage station with coffee, tea and amenities provided. The antique decor was well done!
My only minor complaint was that the thermostat was locked (understandable) and set too cool during the day and we couldn’t adjust it. I know it was to make sure the upstairs stays cool for the night, but it was a little chilly in mid day."

They love to hang out on the grounds, walk around with the animals, and hold the cats. I spend time in the kitchen or the deck, relax with coffee, cook, read, and just enjoy the peace and quiet. There are fantastic things around for short day trips -- Mystery Cave, SPAM museum, the Bison Drive -- or just hang here and play a family game, do art, and enjoy time together.
And the host Ann is just lovely. She is very responsive and helpful, and the house is set up with everything you need. Just bring your groceries and personal stuff and you are ready to relax :)"

Plus there are miniature horses and a llama to say hello to! Our dog loved the yard and the bed was super comfy. All around great stay, thank you, Ann!!"

Group trip","We had a great stay. The host was a great communicator and proactively reached out prior to and during our stay. This is a very old farmhouse with a Nordic theme. The decor and trinkets to look at in the house were endless. We appreciated the bottled water. The house was comfortable and was extremely well furnished with necessities. The heating worked very well. Guests should be aware that the stairs to the upper level are very steep, but that is to be expected in a farmhouse that is over 100 years old. Access to the house requires driving on about 2 miles of gravel road."

Outside you have the whole farm to yourself with lots of animals to play with and places to explore. I am 81 years old and totally loved this place.

Group trip","Large, lived-in, farmhouse right off
I-90. Lots of kitties, goats, horses and a llama. Big kitchen, perfect for our group. The three bedrooms upstairs are not private. You walk through the first to get to the second and through the first and second to get to the third. The downstairs bedroom is wonderful. Snacks and bottled water were plentiful and a welcoming touch. The house is chock-full of stuff. My only ""complaint"" would be the mothball smell. For the price and the description, I thought it would be more upscale, but I don't regret choosing the farm for our stay."

It's an old farmhouse- well-maintained, immaculately clean, and completely unpretentious. There's a real television with real local stations, no smart tv needed. Inside is comfortable, outside is spectacular. The kitchen was well-stocked, perfectly designed, with a deck overlooking the ponies. Amenities were plentiful, more than I needed. Hand-made quilts, vintage wine glasses, friendly goats- my pups and I were in heaven. Best night's sleep I've had in months. Thank you, Ann."

The beds are comfortable so you can get some good rest. The master bedroom has an alcove for a youngster to sleep which I liked.
The kitchen is well equipped for making meals and plently of utensils and dishes. That is good for my family of 7.
The bathroom shower is good where most places I have stayed dont have good water pressure.
The horses, llama and cats/kittens and goats were such a treat to interact with. The kids enjoyed feeding the animals and playing on the swing outside.
Wifi worked well around the space.
The host, Ann, was great with communication and made sure we had everything we needed. She even had some snacks on the kitchen island for the kids. Such a nice touch.
Another great experience, Hopefully we can make another trip here in the future."

The house itself is a beautiful older design and Ann has done a fantastic job making it comfortable and welcoming.

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Ann's place was great! The location was just what we needed and we appreciated the ability to bring a pet. Ann's description of her place is spot on and I found most of the other reviews to be accurate as well. Everything you need for an overnight stay is there. All you will need to bring in is clothes and maybe personal items, although Ann does supply most of the items you will need to freshen up(towels, washcloths, soap, lotion, etc). Snacks, bottled water, coffee/tea are provided. We didn't have a chance to meet Ann d/t both of our overnight stays being brief(late check-in and early check-out), but she was easy to reach and very pleasant to communicate with. Check-in was simple. The beds were comfortable, and the comforters and blankets were numerous and warm. The location was just as described. Easy access to major roads but still quiet. The only thing I would echo from another review is that if someone is traveling with a ""busy"" toddler this might be a more difficult home to be in d/t the number of memorabilia and breakable items within easy reach. If we are traveling this way again, I would definitely consider this an easy choice for another stay."

Ann was very responsive to my messages and questions. there's plenty of amenities in case you forget anything. there were plenty of books and little toys to keep them busy inside in the evening. there's a little kid/toddler bed in the master room which is nice for those that might be a little scared sleeping in a new place.
you can tell there's a lot of history in the house which I find fascinating and the Scandinavian decor is nice. i loved the hand painted houses in the dining area."

The kids enjoy the farm immensely. There was a swing out back, a play area and ride on toys available. We bought some apples and carrots to feed the llama and horses with approval by the owner.

The house is clean and fully stocked, as well as very pretty, and totally welcoming. The animals are a rare and extraordinary bonus. There are lots of interesting books and games, as well as cozy spots to read. We can't wait to visit again in September!"

Our daughter enjoyed playing with the toys that were provided and counting all the Norwegian gnomes! We said hi to the beautiful animals and enjoyed some extras like Keurig coffee. Having a kitchen gave us some respite from take-out and hotel living in a cross-country trip. Thanks!

Stayed with kids","My toddler son and I had a fantastic time at the Nordic Horse farm. It was really like an Airbnb Stay and Experience combined, since Ann and her son gave us tours of their other two farms nearby, and my son got to sit on one of the ponies and pet all kinds of animals. This stay really felt like what Airbnb was originally, a stay at someone else's home - it felt like we were staying at grandma's house for the weekend. There were lots of toys for my son to play with, an ample kitchen and bedrooms. The home is older (as described in the listing) and charming with lots of knick knacks so if you're searching for a modern stay this may not be the right place for you."

My family and I were looking for something a little different for Spring Break this year - and we found it here. We were able to experience the farm, the animals, dirt roads and a house built by Norwegian immigrants 150 years ago.
Ann was an outstanding host - easy to reach, prompt to respond, and very knowledgeable . The house has a very functional layout for five guests (3 kids and 2 adults). It was clean and had all the needed amenities. The Scandinavian books and art was a welcome bonus.
I would definitively consider staying again if the opportunity arose. Tusen takk!"

The house is decorated with lots of Scandinavian art, which can feel a bit cluttered.
Ann provides water and snacks, which is very nice. We found the water in the house to smell like sulfur, so we stuck to bottled water.
If you love animals and want a unique experience for a great value, the Nordic Horse is the place for you."

The tour even included feeding the friendly llama and horses. We wished we would have had the time to talk with Ann a little longer. The home itself was very clean, cozy, and stocked with anything you may need. There is a large vegetable garden in front of the house that you're able to pick fresh veggies out of. Our second day we had planned to drive out to a state park to go hiking, but we were just as content to stay on the farm with the kids for part of the afternoon. The kids loved feeding the horses hay, feeding the llama apples, and playing with the barn cats. They were pleasantly surprised to find a new born litter of kittens in the barn. Overall, I would absolutely recommend staying here. My guests and I would stay again in a heartbeat. The farmhouse is cozy and comfortable, the farm animals are an entertaining addition, and Ann is a wonderful and gracious host."

Stayed with a pet",Angel was friendly and provided clear instructions. Checking in was easy and the place was spotless. It was obvious that she put a lot of thought and care into making the space family / kid friendly. My child appreciated the stuff in the children's room. The bedding was oh-SO comfy and we slept well.

Due to some unfortunate personal issues, I had to cut my stay short and Carly was so understanding and kind! Her words will be held close to my heart for some time. I would absolutely stay again. The house was beautiful with a great view of the lake. This was my first time ever in Albert Lea and Carly's place made my stay enjoyable! The pig theme was SO cute! Absolutely adorable. Loved having the rules on the fridge as a reminder and the little map was so helpful too! The shower was heavenly and I really enjoyed the driveway being so large for multiple vehicles. Having a washer and dryer on site was so helpful and the two tvs made the comfort factor go up tenfold! Everything was homey. The kitchen was perfect and we utilized it to make delicious meals and snacks. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone traveling and searching for a home away from home from an incredible host."

Stayed one night","Was in town for my 81 year old mother's class reunion. Eaton's place has history, the building the apartment is in, used to be a theater and a furniture store years ago. This place is huge, kitchen is awesome, HUGE dining area. It did sleep 7 but the second bedroom has 4 beds in it but has shelving to use to put things on. The only draw back was the floors were VERY creaky. EVERY step there was a creak except in the kitchen, but again, this building is very old. The traffic was very loud, every car or truck that went by was heard. But other than that, this place is great. There was no where to eat on the main street, you had to drive to DQ around the corner or into the town of Austin to eat. Went to the SPAM museum will we were there, that was a hoot!!!"

Coffee was provided which was much appreciated! There's a local pizza place & bar a block away which was very good! Dollar General is half a mile away if you need groceries & the kitchen is well equipped. Looking forward to coming back here"

Group trip","Grew up in BP, so we appreciated having a place in town to stay.
While 218 isn’t that busy, there is enough truck traffic on it to wake you up if you’re in sleeping in the main room. Ditto goes for the nearby train tracks!
FYI: the layout is a bit weird, likely due to the age of the building."

I had a business trip with a company within walking distance but would have had to stay 15 minutes or more away. Since I also brought my family for a little vacation, his place made it possible for them to travel wherever during the day while I worked. Since there are a few neighboring towns we went for food and activities at night.
Eaton's place was spacious for our kids to move around and not feel cooped up, they loved the triple bunk and the toys and games to play with. Would highly recommend this place to anybody traveling to this area and not wanting a cramped hotel room."

One was at 10 PM at night and the other was midday at some point, so it wasn't bad at all. The host had some earplugs there which were very helpful, sometimes semi trucks will go by on the highway and can be somewhat loud but with your plugs and it's not a big deal. And I'm a very sensitive sleeper or should I say light sleeper. I also was traveling with children who would be awakened easily but they were not awakened with earplugs in. We slept very well, 10 hours one day :-) there are some fun things to do around the area as well, but overall the space was very nice very clean very large! The kitchen is beautiful and large, the refrigerator is large, everything is very updated and new and functional. There's a very nice curate coffee pot, convection oven, comfortable couches with a large television, the Wi-Fi was fast, and he has games and movies as well . There's a Jacuzzi tub and really nice large master bath . And a very large kitchen and dining area ."

The AirBnB was perfectly located and easy to access from the various venues of the family gathering. The space is located on a busy street, and Eaton is thoughtful enough to provide earplugs if the noise gets to be too much."

Stayed a few nights","I found Brie to be an excellent communicator, the home was as described, but I would have preferred more privacy/spacing between the bedrooms! Given the age of the home, I now realize it was appropriate for that day and age. I would have preferred to have had a TV in my own room, as I didn’t feel comfortable sitting in the living room. It appeared that two of the other guests were male, so I didn’t feel entirely safe/comfortable!
I would have preferred that the host live on site, for a higher safety/comfort level.
The downstairs bath was particularly nicely decorated, but you had to go through the kitchen to gain access. I think I wasn’t prepared for the lack of privacy/noise level, coughing/talking on the phone/foot steps on stairs and hallway were more disconcerting than I had anticipated! The home/bath were in spotless. Towels provided, but could have use some hand towels too! Parking on the street, although told ahead of time, wasn’t the best situation.
I got what I paid for!"

It was very very dark and difficult to find the rooms that we are supposed to be in. The outlets don’t work in both of the rooms that we are in. The house is old and furnitures have dents in them. In each room, there’re many interesting artwork. I wish there is more light in the bathroom."

We appreciated the filtered water in the fridge and everything was easy to find! The only downfalls are the stairs from the upstairs unit were right by our heads while sleeping, so we awoke to the other guests (very loudly) leaving at 7am. And the front door lock does not seem secure. We'd stay there again when visiting family nearby in a heartbeat!"

The space was inviting and clean. It made for a relaxing visit.
Also, It snowed while we were there, and I noticed the drive/walk was shoveled before we left that morning. The heater worked great, too. We would absolutely return to this hidden gem in Albert Lea."

Priscilla has gone out of her way to make this home a memorable experience for her guests. The decor is very pretty and well-coordinated and all of the comforts of home plus more are provided. The house (duplex) is very well equipped and includes sweet niceties like breakfast snacks, Keurig coffee, adequate closets, big towels, comfy sheets and covers, real pillows, a comfortable living room, beautiful rugs, a guidebook of the area, and . . . that view! The neighbors are friendly and the walk around the lake is so relaxing and pretty. There was little to no noise from the upstairs guest and the separate entrance for them made this feel like a single dwelling. This was exactly what we needed -- comfortable, private, well-appointed and clean. I hope to plan my next trip to Mayo Clinic in Rochester with a return through Albert Lea just for this experience."

The view is amazing - none of the photos of the home do it justice at how beautiful it is! The amenities are plentiful, beds comfortable, and the home is spacious. It’s worth noting that there is not a ladder or steps off the dock so swimming right outside the house can be challenging but there is a beach just two miles away, easily accessible by car, bike, or foot. We loved exploring the underestimated gem that is Albert Lea, and Priscilla’s home was the perfect landing spot for our trip. We’ll be back!"

Stayed with kids","The place was beautiful, neat, clean and very welcoming. Snacks and beverages were provided upon arrival...that was very sweet. She did notify us beforehand that the water may not be suitable for swimming due to the increase of algae, which she was right. Although, we did take her suggestion to visit Boat House rental and it was absolutely fun and affordable!! ($5/rental kayak, canoe). Rode around the lake with public scooters. Not much good fishing but we did catch a few by the Fountain area by the mermaid statue.
The home itself was very relaxing. Alot of light through the big windows and open floor plan. Decor was simple a cute! Btw, bed and blankets are so comfortable but gets a bit hot at night because it starts to get too warm under those comfy blankets. AC is steadily set at a comfortable degree throughout the whole stay.
Kitchen and bathroom was stocked. (Bring your own toothpaste and your own food to cook) Alot of great places to eat around here as well.
Priscilla was on point with her services. Communication and instructions were A+ and she was very accommodating. Excellent host. I would highly recommend."

There was a large dining table to eat or play games on. There was plenty of seating for using the living room. Our biggest issue was the height of some of the seating areas was quite low and as seniors that becomes an issue for us. The kitchen was well stocked with glassware, plates, dishes and even storage containers which we usually find lacking at other airbnbs. Cooking utensils were a bit lacking, but we didn't do much of cooking. A good spatula would have come in handy tho. This house was a beautiful house in its day."

I don't know if it was on purpose or by accident, but my house mates were also artisans at the same show and it was great having good & relaxing conversation with (now) new friends in the evenings (after the show set up Friday night & after show Saturday night).

Stayed one night",We got in late and left early so we really just needed a place to stay and this place offers all you’d need for a night! Lots of living space and kitchen space to use if needed and nicely designed private room! The bed could be more comfortable but honestly you can’t beat the price and the location when driving across the country! I’d stay again if we are ever passing through.

Brie herself was/is an extremely nice person and host. I’ve already booked my 2nd week, and anytime I’m in Austin or Albert Lea, I plan to stay here if it’s available."

Stayed one night",Brie and Kimmie are very kind and communicative hosts. They gave me a hair dryer at 10pm at night. I arrived at the house at 11:00pm and there’s no lights on. It was very dark and difficult to find the rooms that we are supposed to be in. The outlets don’t work in both of the rooms that we are in. It is a very spacious house with 4-5 bedrooms with interesting art work all over the house. The bed is comfortable and cozy in my room. But it is very dimly lit in the bathroom.

The kitchen was so incredibly equipped for cooking, and my room and bed was so pleasing and cozy. There were so many thoughtful touches and resources for enjoying your stay in Austin, and in Brie’s home. This is by far one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve had the pleasure to be a guest in. I’d go back to Austin, MN just to stay in this gorgeous home again, and to experience the cuteness of a quaint Midwest town."
