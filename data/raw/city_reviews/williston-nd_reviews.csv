Stayed a few nights","Kelly’s place is hands down THE BEST Airbnb experience we have ever had.
The location was perfect. Just a few blocks from downtown. If it wasn’t freezing out (we’re Floridians) we could have totally made the walk to local restaurants and shops. It is also a very nice, quiet neighborhood.
Her home supplied us with everything we could have possibility thought of. Fresh sheets, towels, full dish & silverware sets, crib for our baby, etc. It was all remarkably clean - the whole house!
Check-in process was easy and there were zero communication issues with Kelly or other hosts. She always quickly responded!
We would stay here a million times over! Can’t wait to return❤️"

Stayed one night","615 at Kelley’s was an amazing quite restful stay with a great location downtown and a fitness center a block away. Neighborhood was quite and very family friendly. Kelly’s home very beautiful and nicely decorated. Kitchen was well organized and stocked with everything you need to cook a great home cooked meal with your own groceries of course. Upstairs attic is very spacious and comfortable aswell as private, if you have kids a great playroom with toys and a beautiful doll house. Bathroom in attic has a big tub to bath. Patio was beautifully light up and a great escape from the mesquites while still enjoying the cool night breeze. Highly recommend if hotels make you uncomfortable. Kelly was very responsive and able to be flexible on arrival and staying an extra night. Much appreciated. Truly worth every penny. Will definitely be returning. Kelly’s place is just amazing! You won’t be disappointed."

Stayed with kids","This home is beautiful! It is bright, well decorated, and incredibly spacious. The front porch is the perfect place to relax and step into the quiet. The hosts are so quick to respond and incredibly accommodating, they worked with us to get in prior to check in time so we could attend a big family function. The location is awesome.
However, she does note this is her primary residence, what isn't noted is that the fridge is so full of her stuff that you can't put anything in it and the house is full of personal things (including closets and dressers). There isn't anywhere to put your own things, as all surfaces are decorated or covered. There was even a loofah in the shower. It was very awkward and I truly felt like I was staying in someone's home, so we were never able to feel fully comfortable while we were there, because we didn't know what we could touch and use and what we couldn't.
Again, amazing host and home!"

Stayed a few nights",It was a gorgeous house and clean. We were not prepared to not have any space for our own things though. The owners clothes were on the drawers. The bathroom was full her personal belongings. The kitchen had no space for our groceries. I’ve stayed at several Airbnbs and this was a new and awkward experience for us. The tenant in the basement was a bit awkward as well since it’s an older house and every step is heard throughout the house. I can only imagine that our noises were probably obnoxious to them.

She had many things for children (high chair, crib, toys) and it’s nice that baby can sleep on the top floor for naps etc without being bothered. Great for our young family of 5 but couple have been comfortable with a few more even."

Stayed a few nights",An HGTV home in the heart of Williston's historic district! I was dreaming about the tub the whole 4 hour drive! The home is even more beautiful than the photos. My mom and I enjoyed the coziness of home while feeling like we were living in a magazine spread! A lovely neighborhood to walk around in too. If you're wanting some room to spread out this is a lovely abode! :)

Stayed about a week","First, Kellys home is lovely. The furnishings are comfortable and stylish, the sun room was delightful. The bed is so comfy! The location is perfect, close to Williston State College and downtown. Communication with Kelly/Jo was very prompt. There were a few bumps that I wasn't expecting such as no closet, dresser or hangers in the main bedroom, the dishwasher was broken, there was very little room in the refrigerator and for me- maybe not others the tenant in the basement threw me off just a bit as I could hear her so I assume she could hear me. Would I recommend Kelly's home? Yes, I believe she is going to address these few things to make her next guest's stay better. Enjoy!"

She never returned a phone call they’re only 2 towels in the entire apartment no hand towels, towels, washcloth just one towel for each bathroom. The faucet in one bathroom was so loose on the sink. It moved all over. The worst part was unable to get a hold of Amelia at check in time. Supposedly she was traveling and out of service and that cost us a three hour delay, being able to get into our room and after a long day on the road, that’s not what you want"

To be fair, I didn't even make it in the room as my Mom is 80 and couldn't do the stairs (steep stairs as well) which were not in the listing. The surroundings were questionable...alot of smoking right outside the main door etc. Not a place I would feel comfortable at myself but would be a good deal for some. Devin was extremely helpful and gave me a full refund so I could find something elsewhere as we had been driving for two days in a snow storm. I would also like to add that everyone I came in contact with was very friendly. Although this didn't work out for myself, I can see where it would be a good deal for some."

Would’ve have gave 5 stars all the way but the place is missing some items needed to cook a full meal with. Needs a few more pots and pans. Coffee pot was hotel size so we bought a nice BUNN and left it for others to use. Also bought a strainer we left for further use. Needs a cutting board and dish strainer also. I didn’t relay this to Amelia or I’m sure she would’ve fixed us up. We just made it work. Great place tho and I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Amelia

Our vacation plans went south because of a medical emergency and the host was incredibly flexible and kind in accommodating us with an extra night to stay. We will be back for sure.

The living room is comfortable and very inviting for conversations , even if you are assigned in the kitchen you can still hear and be in conversation. It is closed to Restaurants and groceries. It is 1.5 to 3.5 hours drive going to North and South Dakota National Park. Elasha is great in communicating via BNB messages, text and phone call. You will feel at ease and comfortable that she will answer if you have queries. I recommend Elasha’s place."

There are 6 spacious bedrooms, plenty of room to spread out and lots of spaces to come together and enjoy your time. It was exceptionally clean and welcoming. The hosts communicated quickly and we never had any issues. If you are looking for a treat away from home this is the place. 5 minutes from anything you could need in town and located in a beautiful family friendly neighborhood on a cul-de-sac. We look forward to our return next year."

Stayed over a week","We were visiting our son who just had a baby. Kelly’s place was in the perfect spot. It was more spacious and comfortable than I expected. Everything we needed to stay there comfortably was there. The WiFi and televisions were perfect for the mornings we spent home. Everything was clean and decorated beautifully. There is plenty of space, drawers and hangers to unpack and get comfortable.
We also really enjoyed how warm and comfortable she keeps the place. Jo was our communication and she could not have been better. She answered every question I had very quickly , often just in minutes.
I would stay there again.

If we could’ve stayed longer we definitely would have. No matter which level you stay on it’s 100% worth it.

On our way in, on the first day, she brought a big bag of ice…totally welcome, considering it was Scorching hot! Keep it up Denise, it’s people like you that add value to others!!! E"
