Only concern that we had was we didn't feel safe or comfortable due to other people that were staying kept leaving the backdoor unlocked and anyone could walk in and out as they pleased. Contacted Host and they responded immediately to my concerns. It was addressed but didn't stop happening. Would stay again and appreciate the price. Safety concerns this trip is the only thing keeping our stay from being a 5 star."

This is a shared space with one bathroom on the main floor to share, but I had no problems and never ran into anyone. They kept it very clean. Felt like staying at a hotel. He also made it easy to check in, had a key to lock my belongings in my room, and was very responsive. Would def stay again."

Stayed about a week","The location is great. I loved having access to the whole house in addition to my private room. Super spacious downstairs, kitchen and dining room. I didn’t need all of the space but can now look at bringing my family with me when I visit my parents home in Columbus.
WiFi was super helpful, two bathrooms (one upstairs and one downstairs) was helpful when all four rooms were occupied.
Really well done- two thumbs up!
Oh- and I lost my key late one night. The host responded quickly and guided me to a spare key! The customer service is over the top. I discovered a washer and dryer too. Next time!
Definitely worth reserving if you are looking for a private place to stay while visiting Columbus, Indiana."

Stayed one night","Older home in the heart of Columbus, IN. Lots to like about these accommodations. Bedroom #3 is around 15' x 20', hardwood floors with carpet rug/runners. There are 4 bedrooms total all of which appear available for occupancy. Host lives off-site at the time of this review. Conscientious host. Excellent communication, responsive, yet respectful of privacy. Ease in check-in with keypad which should allow guests to check-in anytime. Exceptional value.
There's a bit of confusing information in earlier reviews; hopefully, this may help to clarify a couple of things.
All bedrooms upstairs. There are two separate staircases leading up to a landing with one continuing upstairs. About 20 total (10 on either lower set, ~10 upper). One of those lower staircases is a bit narrow; however, the one facing the front door to the home is easier to navigate. If you can comfortably climb a typical staircase, you should be able to access your bedroom rather easily.
Super fast internet: 100 Mbps. Two (2) full bathrooms, one upstairs, one down. There is no need to go downstairs should one need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Shared living room downstairs is rooms with ample seating for comfort. Ping pong table in what was once a dining room. Thought I remember seeing some boxes games for guest use.
Refrigerator available (used for some water); however, I don't know about cooking options.
It's an older home with some character. Clean, simple. Dark curtains to block light. Ample motion-sensored night lighting for ease in moving around after dark both up and downstairs. The floors do creak a bit upstairs, light sleepers may wish to take notice. The door to my bedroom snagged a bit at the top making it difficult to open without the potential of disturbing other guests by making excess noise. Door to another bedroom had a similar issue which I discovered when awakened briefly during the night. Hopefully, host can plane those down for a smoother closure. Should my travels bring me through Columbus, IN again, I'd book again. Happy and safe travels!!"

Stayed a few nights","Super friendly and responsive host! Definitely a budget option. I would’ve been pleased, for the cost, but there were a couple things that made me uncomfortable during my stay. If you decide to stay here, I recommend asking the host if they’ve gotten a space heater or two yet. If not, I would not recommend staying here during cold months. I also recommend bringing ear plugs because there is an Airbnb directly above the bed, meaning every little movement upstairs can be heard very loudly. This is not the hosts fault, and it’s not a deal breaker. Just come prepared with ear plugs :)
Otherwise, the place was neat, and as described. Clean, lots of amenities, lots of space. Bathroom was very clean. The host checked in almost daily to see if I needed anything, which was appreciated. Overall, I would stay here again if the temperature situation was remedied, and if I brought ear buds."

It was a great find, great price, super friendly hosts. So clean and located centrally. Easy drive or walk to downtown and to retail on both East and west side of Columbus.
Clear easy directions and checkin instructions. Very responsive hosts.
We did forget some boxes we were supposed to take to recycle for my parents (80 and 90 years old) and felt awful about it.

A great escape for a girl's trip and about 20 minutes from Columbus, Indiana. She has practically everything furnished in the place that you would normally have in your own home. People, this place is the best place to rent if you are traveling or just need a home away from home for a short vacation. If Rhonda the host of this property had other ones to rent I would only rent from her. Thanks for everything."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our quick getaway. The property was exactly as described. We had some internet issues, but we expected that ahead of time based on the listing. Everything was clean and helpfully labeled. The pool was fenced in and kept covered. What stood out most to me was that it seemed pretty kid/family friendly. The outlets had covers on them, the pool was fenced in and had a cover, there were board games and kids’ movies available. The pool isn’t deep either which is nice and there are some pool toys available. We had our 16 month old with us so we loved that. Check in and out instructions were clear, Miss Rhonda was friendly and came down to introduce herself and chat for a minute, and we had lots of visits from friendly farm cat Sookie. They even had treats ready in case you wanted to spoil any of the furry visitors- we totally did. This place was exactly what we were looking for and we’ll definitely come stay again sometime!!"

Host was courteous, responsive, and extremely easy to work with. The bed was comfortable, plenty of blankets and towels, and she even had a ton of extras in case you forgot anything. We felt right at home. We will be staying with Rhonda again!"

Stayed a few nights","Rhonda is an AMAZING hostess! From the whimsical ""rules"" book to the labels on all switches so you know what goes to what; from the clean, cozy environment to the little thoughtful touches like snacks, she has done a great job of making you feel truly ""at home""!
Plenty of blankets, pillows, kitchen stocked with plenty of cooking and serving dishes-- just can't say enough! There is a huge tv with a dvd player-- worked great for us to watch a marriage series we brought along. We had planned to go hiking at Brown County but the weather didn't cooperate-- I couldn't think of a better place to hang out!
Cracker Barrel in Seymour is just 15ish minutes away, an easy drive. Rhonda's place was easy to get to. The dog and cat visited us as we were bringing things in but weren't a nuisance at all. We live on a mini-farm so we appreciated their being friendly and allowing a little petting! :)
I highly recommend staying here and would plan to again if we are ever down this way!"

Was the perfect 4 day get away for my husband and I to just relax and decompress. Rhonda is a A++ hostess. Her attention to all the details, large and small made this such a warm, welcoming experience. She has definitely set the bar high. We can't wait to come back during the summer to enjoy the pool. We enjoyed sitting out and enjoying the past few warm fall evenings. Loved the friendly little Kitties that welcomed us every morning out on the patio. I would highly recommend to anyone, you will not be disappointed."

Pool was beautiful and very clean. Animal lovers will enjoy the cats and the one dog that is on the adjoining property. Rhonda, the host of this property is very nice and will help with anything you need if you contact her. Will definitely come back here to stay again.

We had room to spread out and finish our preparations for our moms celebration of life on Saturday. We kept discovering all the little touches that helped us relax and also helped us in our preparations. Walkable neighborhood just a few blocks from where hubby and I started our married life many years ago. We didnt choose the house because of its theme, but the theme was well done without being overbearing. Would definitely stay here again! ONLY thing to fix would maybe be some oil on the door hinges, they were squeaky . Thanks for making a challenging weekend much easier! Definitely a five star stay!"

We had the opportunity to get away for the weekend for our anniversary and decided to stay at the Sport House in Columbus, IN. It’s located in a quiet area off a main road with plenty to see, eat, and do nearby. The house is gorgeous with plenty of rooms and space for the whole family all decorated for popular sports teams. We loved the huge sectional and television in the living room with plenty of games and streaming services to enjoy together. The concession stand to eat was very cleverly set up in addition to the kitchen being stocked with plates, glasses, and light snacks, and the bathtub with jets made all the walking we did in Brown County well worth it. The beds were extremely comfortable and the fenced in backyard was a great bonus. An overall very comfortable, happy, and safe stay- they have thought of everything with guests in mind! We recommend anyone staying in this area strongly consider staying with this wonderful host in an amazing house!!"

There was a little lag in communication before checking in, but once I got there, I was very pleased with everything. They really thought of including everything for you - I had packed some seemingly extra items (lighters, a flashlight, first aid kit) and they already had those. It truly was grown-up camping, without needing to set up a tent or share a bathroom/showers with strangers! The roads to the site are gravel, so drive carefully. You're only 20 minutes or so away from Brown County State Park, my husband I spent an afternoon hiking, and the next day enjoying the sounds of the rain from within our cozy cabin. We will definitely be back!"

Even with using the tick spray that they offered and our own we were still covered in them the second our shoes touched the gravel. Some ticks make sense. But to have coating objects outside makes it a little concerning. The last day of our stay we noticed sawdust material on the phone and light switches and watched little bugs pop in and out of the wall. Overall I’m sure that others stays are great. And we just got a one off fluke experience.

Stayed one night","So much better in person! I was continuously blown away by their thoughtfulness (s’mores and campfire kit, informative signs, other amenities). I would 100% stay again because of this. I found the nature trail with the dog potty station in front and it was a beautiful hike with so many flowers. Extremely dog friendly if I had brought mine. I could tell that they thought of every single scenario and need that each guest would have out there.
The perfect getaway from city life and the reset that I needed. With that nature view from the huge window and the light rain noises, I was able to have a great rest.
Brown County State Park was only 18 mins away, Little Nashville was under 30. I had a blast exploring all the shops."

Stayed a few nights",Just as the pictures show. The little smores kit was so cute and I loved the privacy. We had a little friendly raccoon come visit every night but as soon as we made noise and chased him away it was fine. The firepit and chairs nestled right against the woods was perfect for us to relax and connect. Everything was immaculate but I do recommend spraying because we had those big black ants everywhere but of course it's expected because you are in the wood. We Definitely recommend 👌

Stayed a few nights","5 stars for the Getaway house. 1 star for non-responsive hosts. The Getaway house was perfect, just as shown in photos. Very clean, cozy, beautiful surroundings. Recommend it to anyone wanting a restful and relaxing couple days off the grid. The problem was the hosts don’t respond. We arrived 20min early (240p) for a 3pm check-in. We notified the hosts and asked if we could go into the house a few minutes early (there was no one staying in or cleaning the house). No response. We messaged through the app and texted the phone number listed. No response. We called the number listed. No response. Finally at 305p (5min after check in) we called the main AirBnB line, who tried to contact the hosts. Finally at 330p - 30min after check in - we received two different codes to access the house, which was confusing. Bottom line - definitely stay in the house because it’s awesome but don’t expect the hosts to help you."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed in a Getaway cabin for two nights. Wish we could of stayed longer! My first thought when we got inside the cabin was how clean everything was. I really loved all the extra touches(teas, coffee, bug spray, smores kit, ect.) put into the making the cabin welcoming. The veiw out of the large window was my absolute favorite aspect of the stay. The property was so beautiful as well, really appreciated how far apart each cabin was spaced. There was plenty of dry wood also provided which make our stay that much more relaxing. We will definitely be booking our next weekend away here! Thank you"

The road sign is difficult to see and, initially, I was concerned as there is a property in front that is very ""junkyard"", but once past that, the area that the cabins are in is secluded, beautiful, peaceful and wonderful. Highly recommend!a"

I am however very happy I did not get a spot that required steps to even get to the cabin. I have mobility issues (but I don’t require a full ADA style cabin) and while I am ok with stairs they did not have handrails. So if you have mobility issues make sure to let them know."

Stayed with a pet","The Getaway comes equipped with everything you need and then some! Great care was taken to anticipate needs and meet them. The home was cozy and well-appointed and maximized the outdoor space. We loved the big window and the encouragement to break away from devices to truly disconnect. Our only complaint: the bed was a bit too firm for our liking so we tossed and turned a lot (that’s just a matter of personal preference, though). I’d love an option to select a unit by mattress firmness in future. Also, the ticks were already an issue in early April. Not at all Getaway’s fault, obviously, but be aware and check yourselves and your dogs often!"

Stayed a few nights","For the price of nearly $450 for two nights…… I am fairly disappointed. The listing didn’t say anything about the extra costs for the amenities mentioned in the listing (firewood, boxed water, hot chocolate, s’mores, etc). The stove was still oily from the last guest spraying Pam all over. There were dirty smudges on the bathroom door. The exterior door have oily fingerprints on it. The places is about 120sqft. I don’t think I am expecting unreasonable cleaning standards between guests.
The bed was clean and the place was cute. Definitely wouldn’t do it again for the price."

Stayed with a pet","My significant other and I originally had plans for a different cabin however the cabin we reserved was just not what we were wanting. We found Getaways listing and made a last minute reservation. Getaway was very accommodating and quickly confirmed our reservation. This little camper was pretty perfect for a cozy weekend in nature. Our dogs loved the area and we had plenty of trails and walks to try out. We enjoyed all the amenities it had to offer! The beds do get really hot at night so we had to make sure we set the air on the right temp but other than that, we had a great stay. Our pups even got a special treat. Lastly there were other campers within our view however everyone was very respectful and kept to themselves!"

Stayed with a pet","This is definitely the place to go to to literally 'Getaway' ! It's a tiny cabin tucked into a wooded community of other tiny cabins! The only noise you hear is other guests driving to or from their own cabin! The great outdoors is your living room with nature as your TV!! This is the definition of simple living! The tiny cabin really helps you grow closer with your significant other because there's no room to have any ""space"" lol. My husband and I loved the simplicity of this stay and will be back very frequently!"

I read all of the books provided; even bought one. the space was larger then I expected so I was comfortable with just me. the shower had hot water and good pressure; shampoo conditioner and body wash mounted right inside. I'm a tall plus size woman and the shower head wasn't too low and I was able to shower without being cramped. bathroom wasn't too small either. I love all the storage so not to be cluttered. the outside fit pit and chairs were nice. there was a fire ban when I attended but everything for a fire was provided including a smore kit. Bed was comfortable. Outside was very quiet everyone was respectful of each other privacy. check in was super easy and all cabins were clearly marked and there was a posted map right at the gate just to check before entering. overall was a great experince."

There was a burn ban when we stayed, but the fire pit with lawn chairs would have been a great place to relax by.

Stayed with a pet","We overall really enjoyed our stay. I will say, the cabins were much closer together than expected. Especially in a winter month when there are no leaves on the trees, you can easily see your neighbors. Cabins are quite close to the street and each other. But once you’re inside it still feels private because the big window faces the woods. The cabin is very clean and the design is lovely. It is very small but cozy. Note: There is a county fire ban that looks like it will stay in place until April 12 from what I’ve read online. We were not allowed to have any kind of campfire at all, which was a big disappointment. But obviously not their fault. I think overall this cabin is better for one night than for 2, especially with not being able to make any camp fire. There is a nice hiking trail on the property. Brown County state park trails about 30 mins away."

Something about being in nature is just good for the soul. These cabins are the best airbnb I’ve ever rented. In the description, it says “The cabin has everything that you need & nothing that you don’t need”, and that’s exactly what you’ll find. Getting away from technology and playing cards and being in nature is so healthy. What an iconic idea, we are already booking our next trip. We’re planning on traveling around the country as Getaway has Cabins in many places. Thank you, truly."

If you step outside the cabin there is no privacy meaning no privacy at the fire pit. We could see at least 4 other cabins and their occupants when outside. From our big window we could see another cabin and their fire pit and vehicle and could see them turning on and off lights in their cabin at night (we did visit in a winter month so if the trees were full there would likely be less visibility). This did not affect our enjoyment much and we would definitely visit again but we were a little surprised when we arrived because of the pictures in the listing."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay was incredible. The second we walked in, we knew we’d found a spot we’ll return to again and again. The setting and views are incredible, of course, but the amenities are exceptionally thoughtful. We had our dogs with us, and bowls, treats, etc. were provided for our stay; there was even a tie-out attached to the picnic table so they could roam a bit without being off-leash. We had an incredible time.
One note I’ll add for future guests is that the address provided leads you to a sign that says “staff only,” and there are a number of no-trespassing signs associated with a house on the same road. I’m still not quite sure what the setup is there but it made finding the spot initially a little confusing."

Both of us use a C-pap and the way the bed is set up against the end wall it isn't easy to set up the machine for the person sleeping against the wall. Will definitely consider renting from them again.

Not getaways fault just a disclaimer for fellow pet owners to consider. It was every time they went outside we found ticks on her. Other than that place has all you need and is fun. It is very small if small ain’t your thing and cramped then don’t do this one. Otherwise a great time we really enjoyed ourselfs."

But other than that the cabin was well worth it. Didnt like that they are so close together that i can see all of our neighbors but at least we cant look in eachothers windows. The drive in was pretty treacherous and would probably be very difficult for smaller cars, especially in the rain. Overall great experience and only 20mins away from Nashville. Lots of conflicting information about weather the firewood and smores are complimentary. Please make it clear somewhere on the booking site."

The whole set up is super cozy and has everything needed for a true cabin in the forest getaway. We cooked all of our meals on the electric stove inside since it was so cold (got to 0F at one point). The heater and hot water tank did a tremendous job at keeping us warm and happy the entire weekend. 10/10 place to stay, and looking forward to exploring their other locations too."

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I came here for our 1 year anniversary and it was PERFECT. We love hiking and being in a private setting, and this was perfect. We brought our Golden Retriever, and Getaway was so accommodating. They left little dog bowls and doggie bags, which was so thoughtful. We walked the nature path at the back of the property and we loved it! We also hit some trails and shops in Brown County and it was a short 20 minute drive to downtown Nashville.
We even struggled with some snow, getting out of the drive, and their staff was already onsite and came up to offer us traction mats. They were around and available, but not too much in our space.
10/10 would recommend for a private, serene setting."

Stayed a few nights","This location is very beautiful and peaceful. Clean, modern, and well built.
There was some strange confusion though about provisions (fire wood, coffee, s'mores, etc) inside and at the location. The listing says some things are included, like fire wood and s'mores for example, but when you enter the cabin you will find a list of items that will cost extra. Fire wood and s'mores are on this list. (Unless this is changed by the time you are reading this. which hopefully it is.) That said, I haven't gotten a bill for the items I used, and when I messaged the host they didn't answer my question about if they were included or not. Hopefully this confusion is cleared up before your stay."

Stayed one night","I absolutely LOVED staying here with Getaway. In fact, I loved it so much that I actually booked another night. The team was super responsive and helpful in getting me another night and reimbursing me so I wasn't paying a cleaning fee twice. This tiny house looked EXACTLY like the pictures and the woods were even more stunning in person. They even have a private walking trail, which is nice (though it's made of chunky rocks, not gravel, so bring good shoes). The amenities were great. The only downsides were that they mean it when they say there is a small hot water tank. I only had hot water for about 5 minutes both times I took a shower. The only other thing to warn about (which this is in no way Getaway's fault) is that the property is surrounded by a bunch of private property where people hunt, so you will hear occasional gunshots. Overall however, I had an amazing time and this place was the exact amount of peaceful and loveliness that I needed. Thank you, Getaway."

If I had to name one thing but no big deal. We are looking to stay here again when visiting family is the bedrooms face a bar & grill so it can get loud at night. Especially Saturday night. But my toddler was still able to fall asleep.
This place is great! And we have recommended it to all of our family when they go back home to visit. Thanks Tony!!"

Tony is super communicative and an amazing host. We ran into some hiccups with the thermostat and he was quick to support and reached out to housekeeping and maintenance to troubleshoot.
We were able to cook with the provided bowls, pans, and ample refrigerator space. Oil, Salt, and Pepper were provided as well. My kids and I loved the marble bar height counter and ate most of our meals there. We used the large table for board games on our night in.
Great restaurants in the area! Creole, Thai, Asian, and Pizza.
Love staying here and love this beautiful home. My partner and I have jokingly started referring to this place as our vacation home! Thanks Tony!!"

Mattresses were very comfortable. Across the street from 4th street bar but noise wasn’t a problem. Beautiful balcony. We will definitely stay here again when visiting Columbus.

Both bedrooms have great natural light.
I used the table in one of the bedrooms to get a lot of work done.
The deck is a nice outdoor space
The location is within blocks of many of the architectural landmarks, and is just a block from the visitors center for the architectural tour. It's also within blocks of bars and restaurants.
Tony provided clear directions and responded quickly to my questions.
I would love to stay here again."

Stayed about a week","Tony’s place was great. Everything felt clean and there was lots of room to put your stuff away. The photos don’t do it justice. My only concern going into this reservation was needing internet for working remotely, but Tony gave me all of the specifications before hand and ensured me it would be more than enough. Sure enough, it was more than I needed. The dedicated parking for the Suite is a huge bonus, and the “noisy bar” that people mention in the reviews didn’t bother us much at all. They seem to quiet down at a reasonable time.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would be happy to stay here again if we needed a place in Columbus again."

We did not cook, but the kitchen was well equipped and would have had everything we needed. The patio space was super nice and comfy. We actually spent our entire evening out there. I would stay again and 100% recommend for anyone looking for a spot in Columbus or visiting Nashville(only 20minutes away). This was the perfect spot for our 40 year girlfriends reunion! Thank You Tony!

Stayed a few nights","modern and spacious, well maintained. kitchen is open, skylight is nice. Downtown location very convenient, great park (Mill Race) nearby and coffee shops.
wish I had known:
* windows do not have screens, note if you like fresh air during spring or fall
* it is somewhat noisy, which is understandable consequence of being downtown. Commercial trash pick up happens 3:30-5:00A Tues and Fri morning, it is loud and off and on for over an hour
* three bars on street. you will hear people talking and arguing, bars are not super loud, but people can be loud on street outside. generally only hear noise when in the bedrooms, not living room.
* rooftop deck is well furnished and spacious. However, it faces a parking lot and there is a building generator across the parking lot that runs 24/7, may not be to everyone's liking on the deck.
* internet is slow, 50 mps download speed. challenging for remote work and not viable if video needed
* both coffee shops are closed on Sunday"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely place to stay in Columbus. Absolutely massive, brand new interior and yet in a historic building, nice combo! My only issues were that there wasn't really bathroom amenities (no shampoo and just one thing of body wash to share between two bathrooms), which was minor, and that the AC didn't really reach the bedrooms, which may be a bigger deal if you run hot at night. The fans in the rooms help but it was still markedly hotter in the bedrooms than in the rest of the apartment, which was blissfully cool. Still, you can't beat the location and space, would recommend."

Check in and check out process was super easy without any issues. The area felt very safe and the buildings are nice and updated. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. The apartment was beautiful and functional. The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking utensils including pots/pans/cooking sheets/etc. The couches were super comfortable and so were both of the beds! Tons of space, I was surprised at the square footage, the pictures didn't do it justice. The back deck was so nice and the furniture was perfect. The only con was Friday night, the bar located across the street was pretty loud, until it closed at midnight. But, this would not stop me from staying here again. We will definitely stay again if we return to the area. I would highly recommend Tony's place to anyone who is needing a rental in or around Columbus!"

Tony's place ranks as one of the absolute best places we have stayed in. It was pristine in cleanliness, spacious , comfy beds, and a beautiful kitchen. We loved everything about his place. The Ulrich building is refurbished and one of the oldest buildings in Columbus but it was so modern and fresh inside of Tony's place. Tony was very responsive to a few questions we had. We highly recommend taking the city tour of the town. They have an app to guide you to see all the historical buildings. We also recommend the restaurant across the street (4th Street Bar and Grill) . Overall 5+ star experience."

Stayed one night",Tony’s place is beautifully decorated and very clean. The apartment was just as described. Upscale spacious apartment! There were a couple of streets that were blocked off due to a prom parade making it difficult to find our way to the apartment. Tony was very responsive and jumped on a quick call to help. The area seems to be very safe. A church is located right next door. There were several restaurants to choose from that were walking distance away. We were there for a softball tournament. The apartment was only 6 minutes away from the softball field located in Columbus. The only issues that we had were getting to the apartment with the prom parade which wasn’t the fault of the host. It was also very loud at night because of the 4th street bar and grill that was right across the street. This did not bother us at all because I have older children and we were so tired that we slept very well. My oldest daughter said this was her favorite air bnb that we have ever stayed at!!

i gave 4 stars for location because it’s right across the street from 4th st bar & grill, which closes at midnight, and in such a quiet town it’s a gamble whether there will be noisy people outside. there are surprisingly a lot of teenagers doing joy rides around the town in the middle of the night. this is nothing to do with the apartment itself, which was amazing, but just something to note if you plan to have an early night."

Upon arrival the church next door had a gathering for the homeless in the area which was alarming at first and there were people parked in one of our spots. We had to have a discussion with them to clear up the assigned parking areas so that was a quick issue that had to be cleared up but after that it was an amazing place to stay. The bar next door has a loud nightlife but if you are to late like we are it’s fine! You might invest in blackout curtains as well as it is the brightest bedrooms ever! It seemed like daylight all night with the outside lights. Overall the space is extremely clean, in a great area for nightlife which is what we were there for, and a large space to hang out in with amazing extra amenities!! Thank you very much for sharing your space!"

Even though I'm a lifelong Hoosier, never made it to downtown Columbus. It is Hallmark-movie-esque with brick-lined sidewalks, quaint shoppes, friendly folks, and fun little restaurants a stroll away. We came during the holidays, so trees were lit and we were treated to a festive fireworks show.
The short drive to Nashville and Premium Outlet Mall, with the 4th Street Bar right across the street, makes this place ideal for holiday shopping and recovery!
Highly recommend."

Lil’ Grand was clean, comfy and had everything I needed to make my stay enjoyable. My host, Lisa was great. Can’t wait to coordinate with my girlfriends our weekend. I will definitely be rebooking this property in the near future."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic stay in Columbus at Lil' Grand. The house was easy to find, with great off-street parking. Lisa and Chad were communicative and very helpful, with easy, detailed check-in instructions, and lots of local ideas and recommendations. Lil' Grand was very grand, and adorable in every way - the house was spotless, thoughtfully decorated, and was equipped with all the necessary utensils and amenities. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we had no issues or problems during our stay. We are sure our travels will take us back to Columbus many times in the future, and we would not hesitate to book another stay at Lil' Grand!"

My only caution is that it is in a noisy area - there is a bar located downstairs, which I heard at night and noisy traffic at late hours. I’m normally a deep sleeper, but woke up multiple times on both nights of my stay."

Stayed a few nights","What a gem! Even nicer than described, very spacious, clean, quiet, incredible view of Columbus’ finest architectural assets, First Christian Church, Bartholomew County Courthouse, and more. You don’t have to be a Columbus native to appreciate the views! The location is within walking distance of everything we wanted to do while we were there, nearby churches, the Library, & Irwin Gardens. If you have time, walk to Zaharakos, just a block away, you won’t regret it! This space is close to everything downtown, it's a great way to see the amazing architecture of the city. Parking was easy, & nearby the building entrance. The living room overlooks the 4th Street Bar & Grill, always something going on, but quiet unless you decide to open the windows to add to the ambiance. The bedroom is private & comfortable!
Tony was an excellent Host! He provided all of the necessary information prior to our stay, great communication, very friendly, and helpful!
We will definitely be back!"

At check-in the place was really clean (floors, bathroom, kitchen, drawers) and we were supplied with a new vacuum machine, swiffer wetjet and many other supplies as well as tons of extra white new towels and 2 full bedding sets with extra pillow cases. All appliances are new and higher quality than you would expect from an airbnb/rental place. The kitchen is particularly curated and has a high end oven and other professional appliances and doesn't lack equipment at all (we had everything we needed for 3 months). There is a walk in closet and both bathrooms and the kitchen have dedicated closet/pantry space. The mattress and sleeping area are really comfortable with blackout curtains. There is a dedicated mailbox and internal parcel holder so getting packages was really easy. The host has been really fast and available in answering our questions. Overall I really recommend this place."

Jamie was a very attentive host and was so helpful, accommodating, and responded quickly. I asked if there was an iron and she had one in the laundry room by the time we arrived the next day.

The house has everything you need, and the hosts left hand soap, shampoo, conditioner and body soap in both bathrooms—which rarely do we find in other rentals homes. They also had a first aid kit with band aids (which we needed to use). Also, the kitchen is well equipped to include spices and condiments. We ordered Walmart grocery delivery and had a BBQ one night and then cooked a Sunday brunch. They even had an indoor griddle that we used for pancakes! The most important part of the amenities was the basket of toddler toys that was a game changer for our 2 year old granddaughter. Plus books and games that all of us played every day and evening—unplugged family time! We also used the outdoor fire place which is beautiful. Hands down, the BEST rental we’ve had thru Airbnb!

Stayed a few nights","Some girlfriends and I had a short weekend getaway and this home was a nice respite to return to. Close to the outlet mall and Nashville, IN which were places we visited. Michael’s instructions about getting into the home was clear and the process was flawless. There was a manual with helpful information as well and Michael was proactive with giving contact information if we had any issues (which we didn’t). The home was comfortable and had everything we needed. One of us drank coffee and she appreciated the kurig with pods (although she brought her own). The bedrooms allowed us each to have our own space. There was complete privacy in the back and having the sun stream in through the kitchen and living room was cozy on a chilly day. The property sits close to an air field but the small plane traffic was not bothersome. The guests in the front bedrooms had to contend with some street traffic but they were able to fall asleep quickly enough after a full day of excursions. Great stay"

Stayed with kids","Michael’s place was absolutely home away from home!! Our party consisted of 6 adults and a 4 year old. There was something for everyone. My husband enjoyed using the grill (and we enjoyed that he did too). The master bath was lovely. The open kitchen-dining-living area allowed us to share conversation easily. All of the beds provided a great night’s sleep. The upstairs bonus room was our granddaughter’s favorite place to be! She expended much time and energy going up and down the stairs and was delighted to do so!!
The many things that you take for granted at home were there, which also made it especially comfy and welcoming. There were plenty of linens and pillows. We used the sewing kit and the hot water bottle. The crock pot was a welcome sight. There was also that one drawer in the kitchen with a tape measure, matches, scissors, pencil sharpener and other odds and ends. (We used that too!!)
We will definitely look for Michael’s place in the future!!"

She fell in love with the teddy bear and wanted to bring him home with us. The upstairs playroom was very convenient as it allowed the early risers to keep her occupied without disturbing those who wanted a little more sleep time.
The provided supplies in the large, well stocked kitchen were much appreciated and utilized.
Our host was great at communicating throughout the process and provided us with timely updates and responses to our questions leading up to an easy check-in.
We highly recommend this home and wish we could have stayed longer."

Though my drive to work was 35 min away, it was totally worth it to be at such a great home. The grandparents came with and had the master bedroom and bath...so they had their own space. Our 3 kids wanted to move in forever! Beds were comfy and we loved the extra blankets, great heating and cooling. Plenty of room for having a couple of family guests over for dinner. There was an extra toddler bed and pack n' play for our 3 and 1 yr old. I am so glad we ended up at this beautiful home and will definitely book again if we can!"

Only negative. The third bedroom had a daybed/trundle bed setup. Great for kids, but our group was middle to old age. Not very comfortable. I think two twin beds would have worked so well for our group.
We were aware of this set up going in to our weekend, but all other aspects of the house were perfect, so we made do."

Stayed a few nights","Micheal's place was nothing short of amazing. We loved making cappuccino/latte coffees every morning and enjoying each other's company in the large, open kitchen/living area space. The beds were SO comfortable. The communication with Michael and his daughter (who helps manage the home) was easy and helpful. This place made us feel right at home. I've described it as feeling like you're staying at your aunt and uncle's house and they're just out of town. We truly felt right at home and peaceful for a few days. I absolutely recommend this place, and will be back if/when I need to stay near Columbus again. It was also 8-12 minutes to anything you could want and need - perfect location. It was also extremely clean; this was the happiest I've been with cleanliness in any airBNB I've ever stayed. 100% recommend -- thank you, Micheal + family!"

His place was PERFECT for us.
First of all it was very close to where we needed to be (within walking distance).
Secondly it was very comfortable and clean. Making it feel like a home away from home atmosphere.
We are hoping to come again in a few months.
PS: It was wonderful to have things available that we had forgotten ( hand lotion, coffee creamer)
Saving us an early morning run to the store. 😀"

Stayed a few nights","This is our second stay with Jay and just like the first time, it was an amazing place! Super clean, an abundance of extra linens, pillows, and towels. The place is very convenient to anywhere in Columbus, as well as close to the highways. We will definitely be staying with Jay whenever we come back to Columbus!"

Stayed a few nights","A great studio apartment close to downtown shops, restaurants, and businesses, practically across the street from the Columbus Visitors Center. It feels very roomy and has all the stuff one or two people would need for a couple of days. The unit is on the first floor with only a few steps to negotiate and parking is close by. Dr. Christopher was quick to respond to my questions and was great to work with."
