Stayed with kids","We loved our stay here! Our host, Stephanie, was awesome! I appreciated her quick response time, friendly nature, and willingness to share her knowledge of the local landscape.
The house itself was perfect for our family. The location was exactly what we were looking for. It was within easy walking or driving distance from most attractions on the Outer Banks. There is so much to do in this area, and the beaches are clean and gorgeous. The breeze that blew across the sound was incredibly relaxing and rejuvenating. When we wanted to be inside, the central air worked great to keep us cooler. The house was spotlessly clean, and we appreciated the full kitchen so much because my kids and I both have food allergies, and we preferred to make most of our meals ourselves.
The house felt incredibly private despite being closer to the road than I had imagined. It was not loud at all! I slept like a baby and the rest of my family did too! I highly recommend this property! Thanks Stephanie!!!"

Stayed with kids","This sweet house was perfect for our two kiddos, ages 6 & 8. They loved fishing and crabbing off the private dock every chance they got. Early morning sunrise was incredible and very peaceful.
Kayaking, sunsets on the dock and the breeze off the water were wonderful. The tavern next door provided live music on the Friday we stayed! Very close to the wright memorial and bike paths that are fun too!
Stephanie was super responsive and helpful. We had everything we needed.
The drive to the beach side is about 5-7 minutes. This house is best for folks looking for a sound side experience, as a beach day does entail a notable drive across 158.
If you are in search of luxury and privacy, this is not your house. While we had everything we needed, and felt very comfortable, the house is on a major road where the traffic is frequent and the house is just as described “little”.
Cannot stress enough, where the front of the house is noisy and busy, the backyard feels like another world."

Stayed a few nights","Such a wonderful little house for our stay in North Carolina. It’s in such a perfect location. Not in the busy area but so close to everything there is that you would ever need while being there. No drive to any place ever took more than 15 minutes.
If you stay make sure you visit Steamers for dinner. Pricey but you won’t regret it one bit.
As for the house and land it is absolutely beautiful out back. They have everything in the back to relax and watch sun rise up. Did some fishing off the Pier and caught 2 puppy drum. Pretty sure with the right kind of bait you could hammer down on some fish. They are constantly jumping.
In the House it is extremely clean. That close to the water and we didn’t even see a fly in the house. Fly swatter available if you do find one. Had some snacks in a bowl in case we were hungry when we arrived. Creamers In the fridge and a stocked cabinet of salt sugar etc. The AC unit will freeze you out, if you let it, at 70 degree. Perfect perfect perfect.
Stephanie is very very responsive to any messages sent. Within minutes we had replies to anything we sent to her."

Stayed a few nights","I cannot express enough how much we loved this home. Usually, we choose oceanfront homes; but, decided to change things a bit this year. It was the best decision. We enjoyed this home so much. My kids loved fishing, crabbing and kayaking. The view is better than any picture can show. We had everything we needed to make meals. The home was extremely clean. Stephanie was amazing. She answered questions immediately and gave us great suggestions while we were there. I highly recommend this home and can’t wait to visit again."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely a wonderful property to stay at!! Stephanie does an exceptional job of providing practically everything you would need and much more than we expected. The location is beautiful. My son had a blast using the crab pots provided to catch some blue crabs, which seemed to be plentiful close to the dock. Even though there is a bar located next door, we heard no noise from them other than occasional voices when we were sitting out on the dock. Also, we normally live in a very quiet location, so I was worried about the road noise since the road is busy, but we ran the fans that Stephanie provides and had absolutely no problem sleeping. We were all sad to leave such a great property!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful cozy spot with a dock, kayaks, outside sitting area with fire place, and the sound just begging you to use the kayaks or sit by the water. Enjoyed seeing several muskrats and of course the chorus of birds. The beach is literally 1.5 miles away and they let you use boogie boards, sand toys, and chairs. Not having to bring them was very nice. Also, a couple of the supplied games were really fun. Loved it!"

We didn't get to do any fishing, but sitting out on the backyard dock, on the river, was pure joy! Stephanie is very easy to communicate with and went out of her way to provide some very special touches. We would recommend Stephanie's cottage to anyone looking for a getaway."

The house is nicely appointed with everything you might possibly need. It was comfortable, cozy and clean. The dock provided a lovely space for watching wildlife and sunrises. We didn't have time to kayak but will on our next visit. Lots of restaurants, shopping and public beach access just a short drive away. You can definitely feel the love and care Stephanie has invested in this little house. Looking forward to.our next trip."

Stayed a few nights","Such a cute cottage. Stephanie was great and great with communicating timely. We had such a good time even with some rain. Crabbing was super fun and we even caught a few fish. It is very shallow and a lot of grass, so experienced fishing might be helpful. This home is on a very busy road as mentioned, but we got used to it and pretended like we were the only ones in the world on our own private dock! A great weekend get away!"

Nice little offerings from the host (toiletries, basic first aid, stocked kitchen, etc.) Only ""complaint"" would be not knowing a bar was right next door prior to booking. Only heard the live music being played one night, and a noise machine in the house helped muffle it"

We will definitely be asking to stay again when we return to OBX.

Stephanie and Gary have thought of everything to help make this stay perfect.

Stayed with kids","This property is truly a gem! It is an older house but has been maintained well. The house is exactly as described and pictured. I appreciated the detailed description of the property and pictures. It is on a busy road which we knew prior to booking but honestly when inside the house or in the backyard we didn’t really notice the traffic noise. We enjoyed the included kayaks and this alone saved us money, kayak rentals can get expensive. The convenience of having them available anytime was also a nice perk! The house is very clean. The beds and couch were all very comfy. The house has has everything you need to feel right at home. We did not have to purchase any extra supplies for cooking or cleaning which is not usually the case when staying in a rental. Stephanie was very informative about restaurants and activities in the area and made it clear that she was available should we need her for anything."

The shed includes a sun umbrella and life jackets. The location is very close to the beach, restaurants, etc. The cabin is right along a main road, so there was some traffic noise when outside. Overall we were very happy with our stay!"

The house is located on a busy road but we never heard anything and one of us was a light sleeper. It was a 20 minute walk to the beach and the Wright Bros monument was on the way. Great food in walking distance and there is even a bar next door. Stephanie was super responsive to our inquiries and offered helpful suggestions. This place is a gem and we would stay again given the opportunity."

They have gone above and beyond with hospitality and extra items. Literally just bring your clothes and groceries.
If you plan to fish here, you won’t have much luck.
Also, parking can be tricky, don’t park on the right side of the house. Parking is tight but you can manage to get in and out.

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie is a great host, she communicated well and suggested places to see and do. Her place is very nicely located only a couple minutes drive to the main area of food/activities. She has a dock and kayaks to use in the Sound water right in the back yard. The place is immaculately clean and the space is well thought out, there is plenty of room for two people and I'm sure 2 small children with their parents would be just fine there as well. One reviewer had mentioned creaky floors...yes they are creaky but for just the two of us we didn't really mind them but could see where some people may find them noisy. The house is located along a busy road so for people who are light sleepers, you should bring ear plugs or use the noise machine that Stephanie provides. The road traffic isn't bad between 10pm and 5am. She also has an outdoor shower for those days at the beach playing in the sand. The inside shower is on the small side but was fine for my wife and I for a couple days. Remember that this is an older house and the space has been used very well to have all the amenities she offers. If you have any questions before reserving, I'm sure Stephanie would be glad to answer them for you."

We took evening kayak rides to visit the many otters hanging out in the bay. As described in the listing, you can certainly hear the traffic on the road but the waterfront is so active with jumping fish and hunting ospreys that you quickly learn to tune out the noise of the human world.

This didn't disrupt any sleep, but there is the sound of cars, and the dock is very visible from road while most of the well-kept little yard was pretty hidden. Bar next door wasn't open during our stay, so no idea what that impact might have been...overall, nice little spot with plenty around."

It’s perfectly located yet out of the hustle and bustle near the beach. It was a quick maybe 3-4 minute drive to the beach, right near the Wright Brothers memorial. After a long day at the beach or exploring all that OBX has to offer, it was nice to enjoy the back yard and sound and go kayaking, or just take in the beautiful surroundings. The outdoor shower is perfect too after just coming back from the beach. Stephanie really went above and beyond with the little extra touches around the house. She had wonderful communication the entire time as well! I highly recommend booking Stephanie’s home when visiting the outer banks!"

Stayed a few nights","A lovely cottage and convenient location with gorgeous views of the inlet, especially as the sun went down.
Stephanie was a very responsive host with lots of recommendations for activities in the area. Plenty of towels (both bath and beach) and some additional amenities for the beach was a great addition to help make sure we had everything we needed for our beach excursions.
While we didn’t do any crabbing, we did enjoy access to the kayaks during our stay.
The floors are pretty creaky, so if you’re traveling with others and are a light sleeper, you might want to pack some ear plugs. Once one person was up and moving, everyone was awake."

Stayed with kids","The first thing you need to know is that this house is on a very busy road that stays busy all night. I was able to hear traffic noises while I was going to sleep. There is also not an easy place to park next to this house on the busy road. I was told to parallel park in the yard. This makes getting in and out difficult. The busy road also feels intrusive when trying to kayak and enjoy the water view from the dock. The beach access is about a 5-10 minute drive away. One of the other reviews indicated that it is a walk to the beach. This is not the case. I can say that the bed is comfortable, and there is a well equipped kitchen and a nice outdoor shower. My son and I had a good time overall."

We had our e-bikes with us and easily got around up and down the coast. The charm of the interior decoration and the feel of being much larger than it is left us wanting to move in! Loved sitting out on the front porch with morning coffee or evening snacks. Close to many great restaurants and ice cream. Avalon pier was a beautiful place to walk. In the midst of all the huge condo type locations, this is the most perfect little spot in the outer banks!"

We were able to see all the Lighthouses, Jockey's Ridge, Wright Brothers memorial, Jennette's Pier, the NC Aquarium and Lost Colony play on Roanoke with ease. There are two beach access' about a 3 minute walk from the house, with one being at a fishing pier with parking. The house itself very intimate, comfortable, well stocked with a full kitchen and gas range/oven. Perfect for a couple who wants to balance cooking and eating out. A lot of natural light and an open ceiling plan kept the house nice and cool in the ~100 heat index we had through the week. The natural wood walls were always nice to look at. The host Amy is quick to respond and very nice. She shared restaurant ideas and kept in contact the whole week. It rained quite a few nights so we couldn't sit out on the lovely porch. Highly recommended for a couples Outer Banks getaway."

Overall, so well designed and outfitted, and just across the street from the beach, a great bar, and next door to a good restaurant and oyster bar. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANY COUPLE (or small family) THAT LIKES TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE BEACH, A GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND COOK, AND EASY ACCESS TO ALL THE OTHER AMENITIES LIKE COFFEE SHOPS, RESTAURANTS AND BARS/BREWERIES."

The decor is *beautiful* and professionally designed. The space is excellently equipped with lovely soaps and great kitchen tools, spices, etc. We loved being across the street from Avalon Pier. What a fun spot that is! You can also see a sliver of ocean and sunrise from the kitchen window and one of the bedroom windows. We loved the atmosphere of the space. It was a cold time of year when we stayed, and it was chilly inside despite the heating unit. So, I recommend packing the rt clothing. If you are traveling with another couple, note that the doors on the bathroom and bedroom are glass and transparent. So, privacy is limited in the small but wonderfully cozy, sweet space."

Stayed a few nights","The Octopus Garden is the most delightful little cottage! Perfect for a romantic getaway for two - since it was just the two of us, we used the twin bedroom as a sitting room while we were writing. I’ve visited OBX for many years and this is my new favorite place to stay. For my wife, she’s only ever stayed in OBX a few times, first visit staying at The Octopus Garden. We stayed at a hotel for her second visit, and it just didn’t compare - so when we saw the cottage available during a 3-day weekend for us (we’re teachers), we just had to go! So it has become a special place for both of us. 😄
Amy is a spectacular host. I let her know we would be getting in late after work, so she left a light on for us, and she checked in to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay and was clear and kind in all of her communication.
Overall, the cottage is just as wonderful Amy is. The cottage is cozy, quaint, well taken care of, and decorated beautifully. The kitchen has great appliances and is stocked with some necessities already, same goes with the amazing bathroom. Seriously, even on this second visit, we still marvel at the bathroom despite having experienced it before. The smoothed stones create a delightful texture, and they are not slippery in the shower at all. I think my only wish for the cottage would be to add grab bars in the shower - with my cerebral palsy, my muscles are affected, which in turn affects my balance. So having a grab bar, rather than me leaning against the wall, would be helpful. Otherwise, the cottage is lovely and we can’t wait to return as soon as possible!"

Stayed a few nights","This quaint cottage is everything it says it is and more. Quaint and cozy, and a perfect spot for 2 or 3. It is located across the street from the beach, with easy and quick access to the ocean. No direct ocean view, but the front patio is perfect for enjoying the beach vibe. Well equipped, and when we couldnt find a cork screw, Amy was quick to deliver one in person! Communication is top notch, and the location is perfect to explore OBX to both the north and south. Comfy beds, great shower, and all the amenities you need when away from home - including a TV that allowed us to watch our favorite NFL team on Sunday Night Football. The one thing to be aware of is that privacy is a bit lacking in the cottage, as the bed and bathroom doors are glass and open up into the living area. The single bedroom does have a curtain to pull across the door, and the bathroom door has a bit of a cover over the door, but an open window into the living area (great for watching TV while brushing you teeth, however!) This was in no way an issue for us two friends traveling together, but if you do need 100% privacy in those locations, this is something you may want to know. I would not hesitate to recommend this cottage to a couple, close friends, or small family."

Stayed a few nights","If you are debating on booking this cottage - do yourself a favor and go for it! I can't say enough about what a special place this is. I traveled to the coast with my parents, and we had such a memorable time here.
We loved the decor - during the whole time we kept finding new decorations or a new dish or glass that we had not spotted before and we found so charming. The kitchen is just beautiful - and so well appointed, you really have everything you need to cook. We really enjoyed the front deck, we ate all our meals outside, enjoying the fresh sea air, and watching people drive or bike by. We found the beds to be very comfortable, and the linens and towels were a great quality.
The cottage is right across the street from the beach, and very close to public beach access. You can hear the waves at night from the beach house. Amy has supplied everything you could need to enjoy the beach, chairs, umbrella, boogies boards, and a cart to carry everything in. We took the chairs to the beach in the evening, and relaxed watching the water. There is an outdoor shower so you can wash sand off when you return.
Amy is hands down the nicest host I have encountered on Airbnb She responds to messages very quickly, was able to be very flexible with our group, and her warmth and genuine kindness was evident in all my communications with her.
I cannot recommend Amy and the Octopus Garden enough - we would love to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","Amy's beach cottage is nothing short of magnificent. It's cozy, perfect for a week on the Outer Banks. This is our second time staying here, with another upcoming next year. The towels and linens and bathroom are perfect, the bed is excellent, Amy had coffee and all the cooking utensils, the internet and cable TV are great, her communication is flawless, and she's pleasant and sweet natured -- you can see that she loves the Outer Banks and takes great pride in her cottage. My wife and I took a short walk across the street for a walk on the beach and the Avalon Pier, we had dinner at Awful Arthurs -- the prime rib on Fridays, with mac and cheese, lobster and crab bisque and oysters are all amazing. We loved Kill Devil Diner a few miles south on Virgina Dare Road and of course the ride to Hatteras is spectacular."

Stayed a few nights","This beautiful Cottage is the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. Amy has put together a unique and artistic cottage that will make your OBX experience unlike any you’ve ever had, it’s truly exceptional, from the sparkling cleanliness to the excellent beds and kitchen, to the linens and coffee maker and toiletries to the outdoor shower. It’s a 1 minute walk to the fishing pier — which is a must for the views and arcade and bar (one of which is open to the sky) — Awful Arthur’s Oyster Bar is also a minute across from the pier. The location is perfect for day trips from Duck to Hatteras with plenty of shops and restaurants, and if you’re looking to take a walk with coffee for a sunrise over the sea, it’s right across the street. Perfect. Amy is amiable and sincere, her communication is fast and flawless. Octopus Garden is simply excellent on any measure."

Often you stay somewhere and don't have what you need to cook a meal.. not so at Amy's... ex. a great set of knives, strainers, all the right cookware. The place is more adorable than in the pics.. in a convenient spot to walk to restaurants, the pier, etc... and Amy was super accommodating and accessible. I'll look forward to staying there again!!!"

Stayed a few nights","I treated my fiancée to a 3-day trip to OBX (as she had never been before), so we celebrated her late birthday and our early anniversary. Travelers, if you are a couple (with or without a child or friend who can stay in the twin bed separate room), this cottage is for you! My fiancée and I adore this cottage and were so sad to leave. It felt like staying at a friend’s house, with thoughtful things like coffee and tea there already, and some basics in the fridge like a filtered water pitcher, coffee creamer and butter, then clean and fresh sheets and towels too - everything was clean and cozy. The location is also great, right in Kill Devil Hills on beach road. It’s just a quick 5 minute walk up the road, through the public access pass, and then you’re by the ocean. The house is well-furnished, and while I may not be the biggest fan of leather couches, overall the cottage is very comfortable and cozy. Amy is just a superstar, readily available when we had questions and compliments, and she made the check-in and check-out processes simple and easy. We already want to stay again, it’s just that lovely. Many thanks to Amy and the locals of OBX for being so friendly and amazing!!"

The value you get for your money is incredible. 2 minutes walking distance to the beach, outdoor shower, tons of options around for food and drink, and you even get to look out on the ocean from the deck. As a bonus, you get tasteful decor with lots of hardwood, and although we didn’t use it much, a really well designed and functioning kitchen. We like to visit Kill Devil Hills every couple of years or so and we will be seeking this place out for our next trip."

Cozy, close to the beach and perfect location to drive to some of the best attractions and scenery in OBX. Perfect for a couple (or a couple with a kid) to take time off the busy day life and enjoy time at the deck watching the sunset with a good bbq. The cottage had a cabin feel with very thoughtful details that made you feel at home. Hair dryer, shampoo, nail remover, hair spray, olive oil, were just a few of all the unexpected items available to use in the cottage. Amy was an awesome host, very responsive, understanding and even warned us about the bad weather ahead of time. Already decided to make it an annual retreat! Can’t wait to come back."

There were plenty of touches throughout the cottage that prove Amy has put thought in to what her guests need and want in a vacation rental. Check in/out was a breeze. We had some issues with a recent Airbnb rental and my husband was hesitant not to stay in a hotel but this vacation renewed our faith in choosing to use Airbnb.

Stayed a few nights","My favorite place to visit EVER. Amy is extremely sweet and accommodating. The cottage will leave you with a memorable feeling and energy that is so special. Amenities are endless. If your a big TV watcher on vacation don’t stay here the tv is very small and this place is more for experiences rather than tv. Also, it’s intimate. It’s cozy so if you come with a spouse or friend, you’ll either get very comfortable and become stronger (get to know each other better) OR you might be uncomfortable because it’s small. This was one of the first trips I made with my fiancé and we come back every year now. This is an unforgettable place. Also, close to EVERYTHING. And the best part is it’s literally 30 steps to the beach. Which is a must for me when traveling to the beach. Driving to the beach to find parking is a huge no from me. Thank you Amy!!!! You are a wonderful host."

Stayed a few nights","When you stay at the Octopuses Garden you will have the opportunity to experience staying in an exceptional AIRBNB! Amy goes above and beyond in providing a clean, beautiful and truly comfortable place to relax and unwind! On the front deck there are very comfortable rocking chairs to be used when enjoying your morning coffee while the ocean breezes clear your mind and prepare you for a day of fun at the beach. The beach access is right across the street. The kitchen has everything one would need to cook a terrific meal at the beach and the dishes, silverware and cooking utensils are top notch!
There is a great full refrigerator and gas stove. Amy provides paper products, sheets, bath towels, trash bags, toilet paper, bath soap, shampoo......and many other items you may need but forget to bring (nail polish remover) to make your vacation as comfortable and easy as possible! Thank you Amy for being a Truly Excellent Hostess!!"

Stayed a few nights","The location and the character can’t be beat. The beach is just one minute away and you can even catch a glimpse of it from the kitchen window. The home is small but full of character and was plenty of space for the two of us for three days. The home is airy with plenty of windows and the beach breeze meant we rarely needed ac when home. The airiness follows throughout the house with glass doors that lead to an intimate space but limited privacy, great for staying with those you’re close to."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Amy’s place the first week of June. The house is absolutely perfect for two people, more than enough of space, very comfortable and sparkling clean. Great location right across the street from the public beach access. Beach cart and other supplies included. Small tv in sitting area, but we certainly weren’t there to watch tv all day. I will say privacy is very limited in the house - very open and airy- so make sure you are traveling with someone you don’t mind sharing intimate parts of the day with. I went with my husband so it was no issue at all. There is a small extra bedroom so if you have a young child, this house would also be a good fit for a family of three. Going to OBX in the midst of coronavirus turned out to be fine. Everything was generally open, masks were worn by majority especially in grocery stores. It appeared most rentals in the area were occupied and businesses were operating fairly normally while keeping in line with the state capacity requirements. Overall, you will not regret staying at this beautiful house. We will definitely be back next year."

It had everything and all of the amenities you could hope for and was very comfortable. It was like a 2nd home. If you are lucky enough to stay here you'll make it your permanent vacation spot. Thank you so much for the wonderful hospitality

The cottage was ready early on the day of our arrival and Amy was gracious enough to let us check-in early. We also loved how close we were to the beach access. I definitely plan to come back!

Anything you could need is already there. With a fully furnished kitchen and a beautifully designed bathroom, we felt so comfortable being at the cottage for our week stay. Amy thought of everything - there are even outlets in corners of the room where you’d be sitting relaxing and might need to charge your devices (even though you should be enjoying the beach!). If this place is available, I definitely recommend staying here for a getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","I just got back from a short solo trip to OBX and stayed at the ""Octopus's garden - cottage"" and it was absolutely PERFECT. Obviously we all have our unique preferences and this place mapped to mine perfectly. It was such a great space - a cute A-frame style cottage that had clearly undergone a complete and very tasteful and thoughtful renovation. The space has very modern style amenities with an old school cottage feel e.g., the HVAC is a mini-split type system that works so well, I never once had to adjust the temperature from where it was set when I first walked in (and it's a high quality Trane so no fooling around in case you feel like being chilly).
You enter the space into the A-frame section and it immediately feels airy and open. The space is basically ""open ceilings"" and it's amazing how much bigger it looks and feels over the quoted size of 500 sq. ft. And while it stands under the shadow of one of those brand new Beach Rental Behemoths and is located on the beach road, the space is amazingly private and intimate. So much so that it's easy to forget how perfectly located it is to everything.
I didn't end up preparing any gourmet meals, which was a real shame since the kitchen is equipped with a full size Blomberg fridge and a beautiful Bertazzoni range and there's actually enough counter space to prep and cook and still set a place or two to eat. But the real bonus for me was an honest to goodness coffee maker. There's an amazing little coffee shop on Helga called ""Ashley's Parlour"" and the owner roasts on-site. Sitting on the front porch drinking a freshly brewed cup of locally roasted beans is the perfect start to the day.
The bathroom is equipped with a rather large and inviting shower that showcases the same beautifully tiled floor as the rest of the bathroom. There's also plenty of counter space for toiletries and a nice big sink for washing up and tooth brushing.
The bedroom is a nice size - just big enough, and there's a small dresser and a wardrobe for some storage as well as nightstands on both sides - and a handy power strip on one of the nightstands complete with built-in USB slots.
There's also another small sitting room/bedroom to boot, which I don't think I even stepped foot into.
And of course, there's a big porch, an outdoor shower, plenty of parking, and beach stuff for use as well.
No one ever wants to leave the beach and the last day is always sad, but after basically finding my ideal home away from home, it was especially tough."

Stayed a few nights","The cottage is perfect for a couple, or a couple with a child. Right across from the beach and a beach access. The beach access is great: it does not have a parking lot, so the beach across from the cottage is not as crowded as it is further down the road at the access's that do have parking lots. The cottage itself is beautifully renovated: the kitchen and bathroom are completely modern, but fit in well with the old fashioned charm the skeleton of the cottage provides. The porch is great, you can see the water from there or from the kitchen while you cook. If you are looking to stay in a real beach cottage with modern touches, rather than a 3 story condo building, then you can't go wrong here. My husband and I stocked up on groceries once and never left the beach road again after that!"

The amenities were endless including but not limited to; shampoo, conditioner, lotion, lavender pillow sleep spray, Garlic lemon lime oil etc. to cook with, an awesome coffee machine, a huge sink, and a comfy bed. Not to mention, Amy is so kind and a wonderful person. We wish we could have stayed a whole week longer. We are 100% coming back next summer and every summer to come! Best air b n b ever!

Stayed a few nights","Sure, the more contemporary built beach houses are big and beautiful but they lack a nostalgia and charm that The Octopus' Garden has in spades. The perfect space for a couple's getaway, it may be small but it is open and airy and tastefully decorated. The bathroom is beautiful (the beach rock tiled floor!) though the sliding french style door with sheer curtain could be a bit of a surprise for some. We were a short walk from the public beach access as well as the Avalon pier- both we took advantage of daily. Delicious food is right down the street at Awful Arthur's or a short drive (in the off season) away. Amy is an amazing host and we enjoyed our time immensely. Should we find our way back to the OBX we will definitely book again."

Stayed with kids","Very pleasant stay. The homeowners were great at communicating and easy to reach. Very clean. Close to beach. Good price. Would recommend to a couple or small family like ours (we have two little ones ages 3 and 11 months.) the only things to note (these are not a big deal to me but trying to be detailed)- because it is the first floor of a home- 1.) you don’t have your own control over the temp inside, so I had to text them about it being too hot for us and they quickly adjusted for us and checked to make sure we felt comfortable 2.) you will hear some footsteps upstairs (they were not loud) 3.) you have your own front porch and back porch but the front faces their driveway/road and back is in their yard so not super secluded if that’s what you’re looking for. Would definitely come back. My 3 year old already asked if we can go back to our “new home”."

Stayed a few nights","This place was exactly what we needed for the two of us! Very, very clean. Comfortable bed...we did not need to use the futon, but linens, and instructions, are provided if you do. Lauren has creatively turned this space into a very comfortable apartment. Wonderful storage areas for our personal stuff, plenty of towels, bathroom supplies, and toiletries. Very nice food prep area with fabulous deep sink. We honestly did not miss a stove. We used a crock pot for three meals and did not have to spend time cooking after being on the beach! We also had a butane hot plate we were able to use outside if we needed to. We only ate one meal out in 4 days/ nights. We planned meals ahead and brought a few kitchen items from home to add to what Lauren already supplies. There is table service for 4 provided. Coffee supplies and pods are provided, also a drip pot (bring your own coffee) and we used both. Full sized refrigerator with ice cube trays. This is a lovely, quiet neighborhood on the west side of the highway. So close to everything you might want to do. Parking for beach access was never a problem as there are three very close areas. This was just what we needed for our last minute beach get away!"

She is thoughtful, thorough, and available for communication if needed, though we had no problems. We were delighted by the complimentary wine bottle! Access to laundry allowed us to dry towels quickly. Coffee machine and kcups were a huge plus for me. Microwave, fridge, utensils and dishes are available if you’re looking to save money and eat in. We enjoyed the outdoor seating as well. It was just what we needed."

It's a very private space that is close to most anything you could want yet being off the main road. This is a hidden gem among the listings and I could not recommend it more highly. I will look to see if this home is available prior to looking for anything else again in the future."

Self-check in was easy and communication was clear.
The place is located in a quiet little neighborhood, but a quick ride or walk to the beach, grocery store, restaurants, etc. Best of both worlds. Take a walk down to the nearby community pier to watch the sunset over the water. Amazing!
Would definitely recommend staying here and would come back ourselves when in the area again. Thanks for a great stay, Nick and Jessie!"

There was a plethora of restaurants, coffee shops, local stores and a movie theater within walking distance. You also can’t beat being able to walk out the back door and be on the beach or watching the sunrise over the ocean while lying in bed. In addition, the kitchen has everything you could possibly need and my kids loved the Xbox, especially since the weather didn’t cooperate for us. Thanks for sharing your lovely house!"

Stayed a few nights","I loved this place and location. I have to mention there was an issue with the windows. We were not able to open them, and that was important to us. The owner offered to give us a total refund, which we declined. The windows we were told are planned to be fixed/replaced by early spring. Having said that, I gave this AIRBNB a five. The house felt like a cottage but with an updated open kitchen. A front and back deck so you could watch the sun rise and feel the sun set.
Washer/dryer worked great. Bathrooms were very nice, and one had a jacuzzi tub. To me, the location was amazing and we sat on the deck each night and enjoyed the sound of the waves. It is right on the beach and there is a private short walkway (10 feet?) to the beach."

For a foodie, the kitchen is fully appointed for creating any masterful feast you can imagine. Local produce and seafood, tuna, crab, even live lobster from Maine just down the road. Hurricane Idalia was no match for the solid construction and made the experience more akin to sailing on a high class ship with the porch as the bow.
Jennifer was always instantly in contact and her place is a must stay on the magical Outer Banks!"

Stayed with kids","Adequate, not great. Fantastic location, not great accommodation. Home needs maintenance (mold growing on air vents, wobbly furniture, leaking patio hose bib, master bedroom window painted shut, loose stair tread, struggling air conditioning, terrible water pressure, etc).
No instructions on how to use TV remotes, and all had dead batteries which we had to replace ourselves.
Generally short on 'included' amenities: host left 'a starter amount' of toilet paper, liquid hand soap (1/3 full), laundry detergent, DW detergent pods, but nowhere near enough for a week. We had to replace all of that during our stay. No kitchen trash bags.
The biggest problem we had was that the internet failed on day 2 of our week (eventually found the neighbor's construction had caused an issue). Instead of dealing with this herself, our host gave us a number to call. It took 6 troubleshooting calls and 1 onsite visit, over 3 days that we had to manage ourselves as our own tech support. Not helpful."

There was an internet outage prior to our arrival, she made sure her internet provider came out to fix the issue. We also left some items in the home, I contacted her after we were well on our way home and she went out of her way to ensure we received them. The kitchen is so well equipped which was immensely helpful for meal times. We brought bikes and were able to bike to restaurants, stores and coffee shops. The home's neighborhood is centrally located with a 5-10 minute drive to grocery stores, movie theatres, and Target. Most of the home including the master bedroom had a fantastic ocean view. Overall my family loved our stay and we enthusiastically recommend this beach home!"

We loved being able to walk right out on the beach and we liked the nearby restaurants, shopping and even the brand new Target!

But, the house itself is the main attraction as is located right on the beach and next to the pier. The house was clean and very comfortable. The kitchen was the most stocked of any I have seen in an AirBnB. I didn't cook, but I definitely should have! The beds were comfortable and it would be a great place to come back with a larger group.
I would definitely recommend this beach house to anyone looking for a beach-front home on OBX!

Upon arriving, there was an issue with the smart lock and Todd came within minutes to open the unit, quickly reset the lock, and provide us with helpful welcome information and tips. The location was perfect! Nearby is a walking path along the sound where morning walks and nightly sunset viewing is a must! I actually enjoyed the peacefulness of being on the sound side versus the beach. Although, the beach was still only a quick two to three minute drive away where sunrise viewing was equally enjoyable. The unit was clean, quiet, and comfortable! We especially enjoyed sitting on the front porch and ending our days on the very comfy couch. If you enjoy a good sound system and large tv experience you will love it here. I highly recommend Todd’s place and look forward to staying again in the future."

Whether you're coming to just cocoon and get away, to explore the Outer Banks, or to experience hang gliding at the home of flight, this place is great.

We did a lot of day trips to fish out of Oregon Inlet, visit friends in Wanchese and Mateo (super charming historic fishing towns about 30 minutes away), and checked out Hatteras (90 minutes away along the most beautiful road...must do!). Evenings we enjoyed spreading out the large sectional couch watching fishing shows on the gigantic TV with the most incredible sound system. Todd is an excellent host, very responsive and friendly. He texted us prior to 4 that the home was ready for check-in which I thought was nice. We can' wait to come back. Really felt like home away from home."

You could walk to the bay, it was a very short drive to the beach, and there were so many amazing restaurants and things to do within 5-10 minutes of the house. The beach chairs and outdoor shower were an added bonus. Todd was extremely helpful and responsive - he came to replace the smoke detector batteries within an hour of messaging him! This was an amazing find and we would definitely rent this place again!"

Todd's place is very clean and modern with many thoughtful little details (e.g., baby gate, k-cups, kitchen utensils, shampoo/conditioner/body soap & lotion). Location was great too. Weather was amazing so we spent most of our time outside, but I'd have no complaints staying in on a rainy day with the giant TV, surround sound speakers, cozy blankets, and board games. We did not meet Todd but check-in and check-out instructions were straightforward and he was very quick to respond to any questions we had. Thanks for a wonderful time!"

Great location, awesome accommodations, and so many added touches that made our stay feel luxurious. The kitchen was well stocked, they had a toaster, a coffee maker and a Keurig (and coffee filters! Yay!), and shampoo and conditioner in the showers. Good brands, too. The tvs are easy to navigate and the place is so tastefully decorated you’ll want to redesign your personal home after staying here.
The only thing I would say is that if you don’t like firm beds, this may not be the Airbnb for you. If you do, don’t hesitate to book this trip."

It’s very dark once the sun goes down unless people have their porch light on. If you wanna go for a walk after dinner or check out the bay at night, I’d bring flashlights or head lamps. 🙂

The entire house is brand new, it is so clean it was basically sparkling. It smells good and clean and it is decorated like out of a magazine!
The beds are memory foam and very comfortable! Im tell y’all, the linens- sheets, pillows, comforters and throw blankets were on ridiculous! Honestly, the towels are unreal! and we really loved that there were real plants throughout the unit. There were games and cards available.
The porch is sooooo nice and my favorite part! There are six chairs and it was just so nice to sit out on and listen to some music!
Todd was readily available via messaging and check in and check out instructions were provided and literally the most detailed and helpful!
NOT TO MENTION, if you walk down to the end of the street towards the water (sound) there is this little tiny beach, where the water comes up to the road, where we fished a little and there is a ROPE SWING!!!! We watched the sunset and sat on the swing! It was so fun and a perfect photo op!
It was absolutely PERFECT! We will be staying here again, without a doubt!"

Whether you're staying for a few nights or the whole week, the house is super wel equipped with everything you need to enjoy the beach - towels, chairs, umbrellas. Inside the linens were spotless and the beds were super comfortable; they even had memory foam pillows.
Colin and Carrie were responsive to any questions we had or if we needed recommendations. They made sure we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay.
The house is in a beautiful quiet neighborhood with its own pool, so if the trip to the beach sounds too taxing, just take a dip there."

We had a hard time leaving the Airbnb to do much of anything around town and the weather didn’t help but we were glad we had this place to enjoy our time in. The views were amazing and I’m sure if it were not overcast the sunset/sunrise would have been amazing here. I am really allergic to mold/dust and although none of this was visible to the eye my allergies did act up at night even though I had taken my medication. So that could just be me but just something to note. I would still 110% recommend!

Stayed a few nights","I must say first and foremost Carrie was absolutely great in responding to my messages both prior to us arriving and during our stay. Although check-in was not until 4pm Friday afternoon Carrie informed me the house was ready at 8:59 am that morning and we were cleared to check in whenever we arrived in town. This was so great because we drove from Northern Virginia and arrived in Outer Banks at 1pm so after lunch we were able to go straight to the house instead of killing time before check-in.
The House - The house was so cozy and although it was our first time staying there, we felt like we were at home the first night. The house was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. Unfortunately, the weather turned very cold and windy with both rain and light snow flurries while we stayed so we didn't get to enjoy the deck overlooking the water as we planned but it definitely made for some great sleeping weather. I highly recommend this house and we will be back!!!"

The house is very clean and very well equipped with everything you need in the kitchen, games for the whole family, and even soaps, shampoo etc in the bathroom - such a great detail. The most amazing part is the deck right by the water with stunning sunset, sunrise, and night sky views. It comes with a picnic table for outdoor family dinners and is large enough to comfortably roll out a yoga mat (or two). Our kids loved the community pool access, which is close to the house. It's an easy drive to the beaches, shops, and restaurants. Carrie and Colin are great and very responsive. Highly recommend this little slice of heaven on the OBX."

I am used to having to take everything to the Outer Banks but the house was equipped with everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable. The folks in Colington Harbor were all so friendly. The small private beach is perfect for small kids and the pool was nice. If you want to go to the ocean, the day use area is easy to get to.

Is there anything better than waking up the the sunrise and the sound of waves crashing on the shore? Nope. The property is THAT close to the ocean and you don't need to worry about privacy due to a dune partially blocking anyone that may be looking in.

Steve is friendly and communicated as soon as we booked and with any questions I had. Gave great instructions, never any confusion. Easy check-in and check out. Another plus is that him and his wife are small business owners not a big reality company, I love that I could support a family/small business!! I would definitely return and recommend to others."

Stayed one night","Perfect for our 1 night stay in Kill Devil Hills. Situated in a nice, quiet neighborhood, the apartment itself is fine with the bedroom cozy and clean. The bed is listed as a queen so not questioning that but it seemed slightly smaller than a standard queen to us. An adjacent room gives space for use of the microwave, fridge and coffee maker. Provided 'to go' coffee cups, wine glasses and some plastic knives and forks were welcome.
The outside area gives this space its edge over other properties - a very pleasant place to sit with chairs provided and a canopy above to provide shade - you basically have the whole backyard to yourself.
Gia, the host, is great - lots of communication, useful resources of things to do and discounts for local restaurants. The flexibility on check in for our stay was also very welcome.
Good place to stay if in the area."

We loved watching the birds and squirrels and the occasional visit from one of the resident cats. The space was clean and exactly as described. We have family in the area so we didn't need a full home/kitchen. Communication with the hosts was also excellent. We would recommend this location and/or stay again. Thanks!

Great location, very clean, everything worked well, and we were very comfortable in the space. A perfect spot for two looking for a weekend getaway. The host provided us great info on the local eateries and activities that made our stay extra special. She went the extra mile to communicate with us and accommodate us. She even gave us a gift certificate for a discount at a local bar/restaurant we liked a lot and ended up hanging out at for awhile - a perfect little date night. We also rented a golf cart from the host which was SO MUCH FUN!! It came with a cooler which was perfect for getting to and from the beach and made parking a breeze. Was it necessary? Probably not. But driving around in a cute little buggy near the beach was such a fun and retro experience we will remember. Overall, a great time with the help of a great host."

Stayed a few nights","Dancing Pines is set in a lovely location - literally 5 minutes drive to the beach and all the stores and restaurants you need for a stay in KDH. The communication was quick and check in a breeze . They also provide lots of tips about the area and things to do while you are there .
The neighborhood is quiet and the backyard looks lovely . As we were only there for 2 nights we didn’t get to enjoy the outside space as we were at the beach the entire time !
Thank you for yet another wonderful time in OBX!"

Anne was a wonderful hostess. The weather did not cooperate with us during our stay. It rained heavily both days that we were there, and she greeted us with two huge umbrellas when we arrived and made them available to us during our stay. She also offered suggestions for places to visit that made our first trip to the Outer Banks even more memorable."

The indoor pool was perfect for stormy/rainy days, while the outdoor pool and splash pad kept our family entertained when they didn’t want to get sandy. Eddie’s place was spotless with a great kitchen for cooking our meals—we didn’t leave once after we arrived. Eddie responded to all of our needs and messages in less than 5 minutes each time as well . We are already looking forward to booking this exact condo again the next time we come to the outer banks!"

The rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms were spacious with quality finishes and furnishings. Host was very responsive to inquiries and request.
Our end of March trip time was ideal in reduced crowds and fortunately wonderful weather. Not an issue for us, however, should you have children suggest checking on the pool status being seasonally open or closed. The quick and easy access to the beach as well as the fourth-floor western views to sunsets and the Wright Brothers National Memorial were great. Would definitely consider staying at this location again!

The covered parking is a great for load in/out. I would love to stay at Eddie's again."

Stayed with kids","Lynn’s place was great! We loved our stay here. I was looking for a place to stay with my 7 year old on an impromptu trip to the OBX, and this fit the bill perfectly.
This Airbnb is small, just a room, a closet, and a bathroom, but it had everything we needed and was the perfect size for the two of us. The mini fridge, microwave, and little table outside allowed us to save our money and eat in for most meals. I’m not much of a coffee drinker, but the little coffee cart was well stocked with pods for the coffee maker, sweeteners, and even little salt and pepper packets, which came in handy when I forgot to bring any myself. The room was very clean, quiet, and the bed was comfortable. The pool was the perfect size for us, very clean, and so nice to have as an option on the days my kiddo wasn’t feeling the beach. We ran into the hosts a couple of times in passing and they were kind and welcoming and very respectful of our privacy. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again in the future!"

Bathroom has a full tub/shower and is likewise in excellent condition with plenty of space. Main room is a little tight but fine for 2 people and right near the beach. If you don't need a lot of walking around room and just need a very clean and comfortable place to stay for two, this is the place. Very nice detailed instructions and tips in a binder. Well-priced for a room this nice and this close to the beach. Lynn was very responsive and communicated well. Hope to stay there again sometime."

We actually worked part of the week remotely there and the Wifi worked great. Lynn and her husband are so welcoming and we will try to book with them next time we come to OBX. Highly recommend.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had such an amazing time staying at Lynn's!
It is a perfect location with a short walk to the beach, where you can hear the waves crashing when you are having your morning coffee on the outdoor table.
The pool and all the items they supply like chairs and umbrellas were perfect and helped us pack lightly!
Lynn and Tom are so sweet and kind and truly love their guest! They provide a ""what to do"" with all sorts of tips with what's great at what restaurant and where you can find the best happy hour.
It was a seamless process and we had such a great vacation!

Stayed one night","Clean as a whistle but very small room and bed. I am 5'2' and my feet hung over. Great location but this room is okay for 1 person. The pool was very small but clean and hot inside the gate with no breeze or air circulating. The beach is narrow due to erosion and mother nature which results into wall to wall people. So set up your chairs early to get a spot or drive down to Nags Head beaches.
Art's for breakfast...Josephines for a nice dinner Or Max's Italian as well."

You’re a block from the beach, adjacent to a prime beach entrance. It’s also right in the middle of the Outer Banks so It’s great for getting around to everything you want to do. Had the cutest girly beach theme! We could have done with a couple extra square feet but everything else makes up for it. Lynn was great with quickly responding to our questions as well! We also loved getting to meet Cleo the bird and enjoyed hearing her greet us when coming back to the house. 10/10 stay!"

All the conveniences packed into the room - microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker (in the closet), private bathroom. Plenty of places outside on the deck and by the pool to relax. Close enough to the beach you can veg in the pool and hear the pounding surf just down the street. Can’t say enough great things about the pool and outdoor shower area. Super private, super clean - I felt like I had my own peaceful grotto. The pool saved my trip since the beaches were closed to swimming all weekend. Thanks for a great place to stay in the OBX!"

Keurig coffee pot with coffee and choices of sweetener and cream. Extra towels and toiletries. And much more. The pool area was incredible. We enjoyed an evening swim after playing volleyball with a full moon lighting the sky. We enjoyed our morning coffee and listened to music poolside before taking another swim before getting ready to leave. I wish we had more time to spend there! Totally relaxed and chill space.

I kinda felt like I could hear everything in the their room and they could hear me. Entrance was on the side of their porch. It was too small for me and my husband.

It was close to the beach as well. Really the only issue was the lack of privacy and the extreme paper thin walls...and the sketchy fact that you could not lock the place and the people in the main house had access to it at any time. Sadly it was not able to be a romantic or private place due to those factors. If you don't mind that then I would recommend this place to anyone, but if you are really looking for a quiet and secluded place, you might be better elseware."

Stayed a few nights",The location is amazing. A couple of blocks from the beach and close enough to the main roads to make it easy to get around but no noise from the road.

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect little room if you are just looking to spend time on the beach. The beach access is amazing, you're just steps away! You will have to eat out, but there are plenty of great places in walking distance and the room was such great value, we didn't mind spending a little extra. Tommy and Lynn were great. Super quick to respond and accommodating. Even though the room is very close quarters with their own living space, we were able to go pretty unnoticed and it felt private."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect vacation spot! Not only is the location perfect, but the hosts went above and beyond to make our stay personal and relaxing. I had told Lynn that I had booked our trip for an anniversary, and we arrived to a bottle of wine and a ""happy anniversary"" message on the bedside table! The amenities included like private deck, grill, beach chairs/umbrella, bathroom products, etc, really made our stay so much more comfortable. When we checked out we were even given a sea shell plant decoration to take home! I've stayed at many Airbnb's, but this one is the best I've been to. The hospitality is unmatched!"

Stayed with kids","Lynn was a wonderful host and the little shell-a-holic spot she's created for guests is clean, comfortable, and the perfect little place of respit just a 3 minute walk from the beach. Lynn was quick to respond to any inquiries and even helped me with a technical snafu on my end. Loved the little chill out spot in the corner of the porch. We could see the sunrise from there. Thanks again, Lynn, for a great stay in the Outer Banks!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was the perfect little ""hole in the wall"". Such a cute spot for a couple or even a solo beach goer (like me!). You're less than a 5 minute walk to the beach access directly across the street. Walk down to Goombays for some great seafood after a long day at the beach or drive 5 minutes to Awlful Arthur's for my favorite steamer baskets. The room had everything I needed, a mini-fridge (with a small freezer), a microwave and even a Keurig. The bathroom was stocked with extra towels and small toiletries for her guests. Lynn really goes above and beyond to make sure everything turns out great on your trip and that you're enjoying your stay! She's a quick communicator which is perfect. I'll gladly be back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Lynn’s place is perfect, beautifully decorated in a beach theme. Located just a few footsteps from the ocean. Private deck to enjoy the evening air and off street parking. I enjoyed my time there and wished I had stayed longer. Also her shell collection is such a treat to look at. I could just imagine the stories behind them all and if you do get a chance to speak to Lynne and Tom , they are both great hosts. Hope to visit again soon."
