He left nice and clear instructions for checking in and out. The facilities were nice, clean and orderly. I can comfortably recommend Farzan's place to stay!"

Stayed about a week","My stay was very good. The owner is very helpful and helps customers solve their problems. He also helped me store a lot of bulky luggage, which made me feel warm as one without a car. Overall, I think this apartment is really a good choice.
The only thing that needs to be improved is that each room should be equipped with a independent lock, which can give customers more peace of mind."

Stayed a few nights",Farzan's is a Home away from home! Quality hosting and quality comfort. I arrived with just a backpack and missed nothing during the stay bc all the essentials already existed (as they should). Some airbnb stays are bare minimal photos may look good but flimsy and void of silverware for example. Farzan's was the opposite. Pleasant stay from Beginning to End.

Stayed one night","Grateful for the best one night stay ever! The room was so spacious, provided ample space to do my morning yoga routine. Huge plus was the WiFi, with several important virtual meetings I had no problem with connectivity. I adored the fully equipped kitchen where I easily prepared my dinner on a large work surface and cooked on a mammoth gas range. The host, Farzan, unlike any other, remained attentive, and assured I stayed cozy. Not listed and completely unexpected the host offered some of the best coffee I have ever had. It was a delightful touch that added an extra level of warmth and hospitality to my experience. Many thanks indeed!"

Bonuses of note included outbound bandwidth >150mbps, and <3min to the train straight to the convention center. I tried the family biz Chinese place around the corner and it was delish. Also, there's a Bay Cycle docking station just across from the train platform. Lyft to the airport was quick & easy. Thanks, Farzan!"

This is one of those places that take you back to the good old days of Airbnb where you feel warmly welcomed as a guest in a friend's home rather than a contactless ""hotel"" experience. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The home is super close to public transportation, so it was very easy to get around the city. I'd be happy to stay at Farzan's place again the next time I'm in San Jose :)"

I would recommend his place to anyone visiting the region, no matter how long or short your stay. Book quickly to avoid disappointment as his rooms get fully booked every night I've been there!"

Made us feel right at home — even though it was just one night - it really did feel like a little home. Would 100% recommend and will book his place again when driving through. Bedroom was nice and clean, bathroom was clean, easy parking on the street, nice backyard, modern kitchen. Really great spot! Thanks Farzan!"

Stayed one night","We had a fantastic overnight stay at Farzan's place! I booked this spot only a few days in advance because we were coming to the Taylor Swift concert from Berkeley and decided we didn't want to deal with concert parking/traffic. Farzan was very quick to respond and his place was PERFECT for our needs. When we arrived we realized we forgot to bring bread (we'd planned to make sandwiches to bring to the concert) and Farzan very graciously offered us some of his bread. His house is just a few minutes walk from the train stop, which took us directly to Levi's Stadium. It was excellent value and I highly recommend Farzan's house for anyone who has an event at Levi's Stadium or a flight out of the San Jose airport. It's a convenient location and Farzan is a wonderful host!"

Estee’s Airbnb felt warm and the house’s interior was homey and chic. Everything was very clean and the bathroom smelled so nice. There was so many supplies for us to use. A bunch of snacks were also offered, there was even Chick fil A sauce in the fridge! Would definitely recommend and stay again. Estee was a wonderful host."

we asked for a late check out, she did approve a late check out at 1PM we asked for an extra hour she refused, and contacted airbnb resolution center and they started to send us messages non stop regarding the matter, because she couldn't give us an extra hour? you make your guests feel uncomfortable for $300. how greedy and unprofessional this host is."

Stayed a few nights","Overall very nice stay!
Pros:
Estee was extremely nice and responsive and even helped me get back some stuff I left behind (twice!), and she let me check in/out on my own time (with enough advance notice).
It’s a great area to stay in, close to major freeways and grocery stores and restaurants but the place itself is contained in a cute little neighborhood that feels secluded from the busy outside world. You get a big driveway all to yourself, and it seemed like there was someone in the other half of the duplex but we didn’t notice them at all.
Cons:
There were lots of live plants inside & outside which was pretty but unfortunately it meant we had a small bug & spider issue. Shake out the blankets from storage before using! It was manageable though.
The tv was confusing and kept saying we needed to install other stuff for it to work. Also it’s fitted with an Amazon tv but we couldn’t find the remote so we ended up stuck with House Hunters 24/7 lol.
TLDR: Still a great place!!!"

The host had snacks and beverages ready at check in which was next level and unexpected. The shower was relaxing and spacious. Decor in the space is also very cute which is always nice to make it feel even more like home (and unlike a stuffy hotel room). Very clean and easy to find everything. The hallway closet being stocked with everything from bandaids to last minute Covid tests blew me away and made me HAVE to leave a review.

Not as pet friendly as I expected so I did have to remove the ant bait on the floors, put all the breakable vases and a cute statue up higher off the coffee tables and the hairy cacti plant up higher away from my dogs. Took me only 5 minutes to dog-proof our surroundings."

The interior decor is cozy with a unique mix of bohemian chic and modern flare with glass, fur, marble, and stained glass throughout. The kitchen is well equipped with stainless steel appliances. The gracious host provides fresh ground coffee, and a variety of delicious snacks and beverages for guests to enjoy. The bedroom is spacious and cozy, and well stocked with blankets, pillows and throws. The mattress is simply divine, I fell asleep immediately each night. The walk-in shower is not to be missed! The sitting area in the backyard is enclosed by a fence and was a perfect area to relax and for my two small dogs to play and lounge around. There is a gas station nearby with easy access to the freeway, plus a Safeway and several restaurants that are walking distance from the residence. Santa Clara University is also walkable if it's not a hot day. I walked my pups alone every evening and felt safe in the neighborhood. Estee was kind, courteous and responded to questions promptly. I truly enjoyed my stay and plan to rebook again the next time I visit the Bay Area. A+"

First of all, she turned the lamps on in the living room since we were arriving in the evening, and there was a cozy inviting glow as soon as we walked in. She also left an amazing and diverse array of snacks for us. The shower was huge and beautifully tiled and had full-size toiletries which was so nice. The living room was very stylish and there were magazines to read while you relax. There was also cable TV which is a rare amenity these days! AC worked great. Kitchen was very well-equipped and would work for someone who wanted to do some serious cooking. The front patio is unbelievably beautiful with lovely lush California landscaping — lots of roses and cacti. Feels very homey and clean and cozy.

Estee was a wonderful and thoughtful host and as an added bonus, the snacks that were waiting for us when we got there after a very long drive were so appreciated!"

The house was clean and exactly as advertised. Estee left delicious snacks on the dining room table and in the fridge. She was also fine with us bringing our three dogs along, which isn’t always the case. We’d absolutely stay here again!!"

We spent a lot of time in the very cute and functional backyard. Location not far from the highway and near the airport cannot be beat, and there was surprisingly no noise intrusion. The unit was clean, and very well-stocked with lots of thoughtful touches that were not bargain basement, which was MUCH appreciated. The kitchen had everything we could hope for, including a real rice cooker. And, there were SNACKS!"

She supplied snacks and beverages, so we didn't have to immediately go to the store when we arrived. She had fresh ground coffee, locally made, waiting for us when we arrived! And an amazing array of tea to choose from. The house is exactly like the pictures represent. Very clean and welcoming. Towels were plush and not worn out. You are supplied with extra linens, bath towels, paper towels, etc. so no need to feel like you may run out of anything. The house is close to the airport, but we hardly heard anything. Very quiet and safe neighborhood. The best part was having coffee in the morning in the private courtyard, surrounded by fragrant roses! The house is pet friendly and well situated for walks to parks. We will rent this house again when we come back to San Jose!"

I highly enjoyed sitting out on the back porch, enjoying the fresh air and spectacular rose bushes in full bloom. Her place was also kiddo proof, which as a mom, I greatly appreciated, even though I was solo for this trip!!
The bed was super comfortable, the shower was warm and the place felt so incredibly welcoming. I was envious of the decorations and how charming the house was. I was sad I was only staying there a short time, but when I am back in the area, would absolutely stay here again."

Minimal noise from the airport which did not bother us. There is plenty of room to park and the duplex itself is super charming, bright and cheery! Spotless kitchen and bathroom with huge shower and excellent water pressure! The bed mattress is somewhat firm, and not my usual, but by the 3rd night I was used to it, and must admit my muscles felt better! There was a very nice selection of breakfast goodies and snacks left for us. We would definitely stay again and in fact have made another reservation because we do need a pied-à-terre in this area. Thank you!"

That said, Estee is a wonderful host and no matter at what time you arrive, she has something for you to snack on. Bathroom amenities, kitchen supplies, and even the fist aid kit are all on point. Comfortable bed and blackout curtains, plus a cute living room area in case you just want to chill and a cute desk if you want to work. Second time staying but won't certainly be the last."

The living room had everything I needed to veg out and watch a little TV at the end of the day- plus there were snacks! What a treat.
The bed was cozy with crisp bedding, the bathroom had a wonderful rainfall shower head and big fluffy towels, and the kitchen was clean and bright. There was even a little private patio in the back to drink my fresh coffee (provided!) in the sun in the morning.
I loved this place, and hope to stay here whenever I am in San Jose... I would love to keep it a secret since it was so great, but I will tell my friends and family about this gem.

Stayed over a week","Estee's place is wonderful! My roommate and I did a long-stay at this Airbnb during our fall quarter at Santa Clara University. If any other students are interested in doing the same, this is a great place to live. Ideal commenting distance to campus, already furnished, well-kept and clean, perfect for two people, and very homey. Not to mention Estee is a wonderful host. She is beyond friendly, very helpful, and a great communicator. When we got to the Airbnb she kindly had the entire home stocked with supplies and food, plus the home was spotless. The kitchen has all the cooking supplies that you could ask for, even a pasta maker which we definitely took advantage of. The back patio is not only great for sitting out and relaxing, but is also a perfect place to lay out a yoga mat and do a workout. In the back patio there is also a washer and dryer, which at first I though was odd that is was outside, but never proved to be an issue in sunny California. The bedroom is a perfect size. The both beds are comfortable (this includes the queen and trundle) and the closest space is endless (two large closets). The living room is cozy and fabulously decorated, Estee's interior design skills are amazing. Overall this place was absolutely perfect! My roommate and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend!"

The place is sparkling clean, beautiful and tasteful. At first we were worried about quality of cleanness because of COVID. But the moment we arrived, the doubts were gone. Our host Estee, kept the whole place just as clean and safe as possible. She provided hand sanitizers (also portable ones for you to use outside) basically in every corner of the apt.
Also the neighborhood is safe, quite that we barely hear any noise.
Estee went beyond her way to help us navigate through our stay, and she prepared a variety of snacks, food and beverages for us during stay. She is very friendly, considerate and caring for guests. We’ll definitely stay again next time we visit the Bay Area!"

Stayed a few nights","I chose this home just to treat myself for Mother’s Day weekend. And boy was I pampered!
The home was far better than the pictures showed. Fully stocked kitchen, snacks, fridge full of goodies, bathroom with every amenity imaginable. I was in need for nothing!
My boyfriend and I made some great meals. The bed was so comfortable. I had the best sleep in forever!
Beautifully decorated and very welcoming. Even brochures on all the hot spots in the Bay Area.
My only issue was not being able to stay longer. I would return in a heartbeat!!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay in Estee's home was great. There were so many personal touches that we weren't expecting which made things even better than expected. Communication was great, didn't have to wait for instructions on how to check-in. Estee provided a range of snacks and drinks which was so nice! The space itself was perfect for our stay with our 1.5 year old puppy. There was a nice back patio area where we hung out one of the nights. The location was great, close to a lot of different parts of SJ as well as Campbell. Overall, great stay and would highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","This property is a really fantastic choice. If I could give it 6 stars I would. Estee is an incredible hostess... attentive, available, and goes the extra mile to make you feel welcomed. When you arrive there are all types of yummy snacks, water, cokes, beers, and other extras that are not typically part of the Airbnb experience. The property is adorable, clean, warm, and extra comfortable. The pillow and bed are also very comfortable. All in all the best Airbnb experience that I've had and would highly recommend this property for anyone's trip San Jose."

The house had everything we needed for an extended stay + more! Estee was very hospitable and went above and beyond to provide us with snacks/local coffee upon arrival and freshly baked croissants several times during our stay! You can tell she truly cares about her guests! Would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","My gf said the best Airbnb she has ever stayed at...and I have to agree.
Estee was always quick with the responses and right when we entered we were just in awe. There was fully stocked snacks, drinks, and a few pastries waiting for us which is something we never would of expected.
We are already thinking of things we would want for our future home. The amenities are amazing. There was a coffee machine, a Dyson vacuum, Dyson heater, and even a juicer!
The location is also great. Felt like a quaint little neighborhood and with personal parking I felt like it was easy to just go out and come back without having to worry about parking. Lots of great food all around within 10 to 15 min or less depending what you prefer and I would highly suggest this place for a great vacation if you in the area. Would book again in a heartbeat!"

Estee always responds quickly if there is ever any questions. The refrigerator was stocked with drinks and everything to make a healthy breakfast and also a little basket full of goodies on the table, not to mention, the day of our stay, Estee bought us fresh pastries and cookies from a local bakery! If I could give more than 5 ⭐️ for my stay, I would! Thank you again Estee!"

Clean, spacious, very stylish, conveniently located (close to hwy 880 and all the businesses along the Alameda, yet still very quiet and peaceful), and equipped with all sorts of thoughtful touches and nice surprises. We especially loved the private outdoor space, modern kitchen, and open layout. This was the first time my partner and I attempted any sort of vacation since the start of COVID (however short and local this was!), and I felt very comfortable and safe here. Check-in was easy and communications were quick and warm. I’d return in a heartbeat and highly recommend booking with Estee"

Stayed about a week","Estee's place was just a delight and a wonderful place to stay. I really enjoyed the decorative touches and care put into making the place feel like a home. I've never had a place that had a fully stocked fridge with fruits, veggies, different drinks, cookies, and basically everything you could ask for ready to go. It was completely unexpected and that just shows how thoughtful Estee is when it comes to taking care of her guests. She also stocked the bathroom with top quality bath shampoo/wash, etc. The neighborhood is wonderful to walk around and very close to downtown San Jose. I thoroughly enjoyed staying at her place and would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in town."

The place was super clean, beautifully decorated, and the bed was comfy! I loved the desk in the bedroom because I was able to use it to get some work done. This was just the perfect spot for a quick business trip and nearby Hayes Mansion where my meetings were being held. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","I was able to book this beautiful bungalow at the last minute. I wanted a private space that I could relax in and this fit the bill perfectly. Maria was very clear on the check in procedure and was accommodating, since my flight didn’t get in until late. When you walk into the gate for the space, there is a patio with a chair and beautiful plants. Upon entering the room, I was greeted with the pleasant smell of cinnamon. The big room had a microwave, fridge, washer and dryer(not sure if it’s for guest use though) a small table, with 2 chairs and a fireplace wall unit. There was disposable dishes, bottled water, a keurig with pods, a toaster. The full size bathroom was nicely decorated, very clean and had all that could be needed. There was a bathtub. The bedroom was nice, a comfortable bed with clean linens, a sitting chair, a desk with a chair and the TV. I absolutely loved staying here, it was relaxing and private, clean, comfortable, cozy. 100/10 recommend!! Thank you Maria!!"

Stayed about a week","We had a great, long-ish stay here (about 10 days). The lack of a kitchen makes that length of stay a little challenging, but for short stays poses no issues. There are plenty of places to eat nearby. The neighborhood is clean, safe, and quiet. Upon arrival we found the place to be spotlessly clean and exactly as described and shown in the photos. It’s very tastefully decorated and relatively comfortable. For couples there’s no comfy place to sit together to watch TV (which wasn’t really an issue for us). I’d rate the bed as just “ok.” It’s supportive, but, for our preferences, the thick foam topper was too marshmallowy. It was great having access the washer/dryer. The mini-split unit in the bedroom did a good job of keeping that room comfortable, and the heater in the other room works well. The bathroom is small but very clean and the shower is great.
Overall we enjoyed our time staying here and would recommend it to solo travelers and couples who don’t need to prepare food."

A very chill & relaxing space. Entry room is spacious, with a small table for sitting, dining, or working; coffee, water heater, small fridge, microwave & other amenities as shown in the photos. Bathroom off to one side (a step up) - super clean and felt luxurious. Bedroom off to the other side, and as others noted, the bed was exceptionally comfortable - like a supportive cloud! :) If anything, a small two-seater somewhere could be a lovely addition, but the bed was so cozy we were so happy to chill there. We felt so refreshed after our one night, and would absolutely return should the need arise.
Maria is such a warm and fabulous host - super responsive, thoughtful & helpful throughout our short time. We felt extremely welcome & relaxed during our stay. Thank you so much, Maria!"

While I did struggle for a moment to figure out how to run the shower, the bathroom is sparkling clean. I have already booked another night next month for my weekend in the South Bay."

The property was well equipped with all the necessary amenities, including a private driveway for parking, a private entrance through a gate and keypad door, and a comfortable living room. The highlight of my stay was the warm shower and cozy bed, complete with multiple blankets and plenty of towels.
I slept like a baby every night.
The host was also very kind and accommodating. Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Airbnb exactly as described and met my expectations based on all the other reviews. Great sleep, good bed, solid location away from noise.
For those more noise sensitive, I'm an extremely light sleeper and need to use earplugs every night. To my surprise the semi-nearby freeway, light rail along it, and occasional airplane heading towards SJC could barely be heard in the bedroom and effectively disappeared with the earplugs in. I had some initial concerns about dogs mentioned in other reviews, but I communicated this to Maria and did not hear a peep from them during the night or morning hours.
As someone who has to be a bit picky about where I can sleep, I'd extremely recommend this airbnb if it works for your travel itinerary!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was very cozy. The TV had Netflix, YouTube & many other apps. The bed was very soft & comfortable. There was a heater that you could turn on & it quickly made the room feel warm & toasty. The space was definitely more than enough for me to enjoy as a solo traveler.
Be aware that sometimes the gate won’t latch from the outside. I tried my best to push it to make sure it did when I would leave because I was afraid it would swing open while I was gone but it is a very sturdy gate that stayed shut even when it didn’t latch from the outside.
Also, I was not aware there was a dog on the other side of the fence. Don’t get me wrong, I love dogs but everytime I would leave or arrive, the dog barked & the last thing I wanted to do was wake up/disturb any of the neighbors or Maria & her family but of course, the dog was doing what they were supposed to do :)
All in all, I had a great stay."

However, we noticed that both days while we were away, someone came into the space while we were gone. We had put the trash can in front of the door that led from the space into the main house and when we came back it had been moved. This was unsettling and uncomfortable. Based off the listing we thought we would have an entire guest suite to ourselves, considering it was said to be completely private. Also, something to note that isn’t shown in the photos, there is a large washer/dryer set in the living area."

Stayed with kids","I absolutely loved our stay here! The place is clean, beautiful and at a great location. It is small and cozy but just the perfect feel. It’s very nicely decorated and the host left some disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer and all-purpose cleaner ready for us in case we needed them. It was a completely separate entrance from the host’s home so it was perfect for a late night check-in. I’d love to stay here again next time I come to the area."

Flora provided a helpful binder about the surrounding area and listed her favorite go-to spots for food. There were also pamphlets that had menus for restaurants which were a nice addition. I was out traveling all day during my stay but always looked forward to returning to a comfortable place to sleep. I'd book this place again in the future if I find myself needing a place in San Jose.

The home is also close to Japantown and Downtown SJ; we had so much fun adventuring out on our free time. There’s no designated parking space so I was initially worried about parking but we were always able to find parking in front of the home. As it is still cold at night, the heater was a lifesaver when we were staying in. It was everything we needed for the weekend and I’d love to book with Flora again if we’re ever in SJ!"

Flora was a responsive friendly host. It was ok. Quiet! Other than chickens at the back window in the morning. My concern was safety in parking and the neighborhood itself. There is an outreach center literally across the street. You have to park on one side of the street one night and the other the next for street sweeping. Very limited parking means you will walk a long ways. It was raining and I had to pull luggage down the street. I would not stay there again.

Stayed one night","Flora's Place is just as listed. She has put in a lot of work to maintain the Airbnb's there. The backyard landscape is lovely. Inside and outside of her casita has just the right touch of updates, while still keeping plenty of character. It felt very comfortable. The bed was so great too. The location couldn't have been better for my late arrival and early departure. She was also a very pleasant host."

Enjoyed relaxing in the garden area too. Very quiet in the evenings, and never heard any of the other guests in the other tiny homes on the property.
Worked great for my event at the university and felt comfortable staying here as a solo traveller. Will definitely stay with Flore again next time I’m in town."

Flora's accommodation was perfect, but also in such a great location. I thought San Pedro Square Market would be a total tourist trap, but we had a great meal there and were only a short walk from the accommodation! We'd 100% recommend staying here if you have the chance."

We were arriving late from lake Tahoe and she was very accommodating of our late check in. If you're a single woman staying here, I would not recommend walking around outside alone after sunset- the neighborhood feels less safe at night. Flora's place was very clean, she's done a great job with this airbnb. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","First and foremost, I have to start off by thanking Flora for her kindness and generosity. She let us check in early due to our out of the box circumstance. This kind act was very much appreciated and valued. We would have had to kill so much time sitting around for many hours if she had not been so gracious and willing to work with us. The casita was beautiful and perfect for what we needed for our stay. If we had more time on this trip, we would have loved to stay there longer bc it was so quaint and lovely. All the cacti and decor was just perfect to create a calming and relaxing atmosphere which is just what we needed after a long travel day. When we arrived, she had a beautiful ambiance of rainfall going on a speaker. Everything we could have needed for our stay was easily found and accessible for us. Our place was clean and easy to locate. We would definitely stay at Flora’s casita again in the future if we find ourselves in this area!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is what AirBnB is all about. Thoughtful layout, secure location, very quiet and exactly what I needed for business travel. I stayed for four days and it is ideal for the business traveler or couple. It has a comfy bed and a nice desk chair that allowed me to work with ease while there.
I loved the thoughtful art, books, and tasteful decor. The backyard plaza is also inviting and private. Besides the early and pleasant 'cluck cluck' of chickens and the occasional airplane, the place was super quiet and peaceful.
As an added bonus i discovered the impressive coffee/espresso maker that was better than most of the coffee places i visited while here.
The neighborhood is safe, but parking can be a little tricky. It is street parking, but i never had to park more than few car lengths from the property.
Flora'a place had everything I needed and nothing i didn't. As a superhost myself, it was so great to her keeping the spirit of AirBnB alive. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",The room itself was cozy but I was really upset at the fact that after a long day and night of traveling I was startled waking up to loud banging at before 8am on a Saturday literally on the adjoining room. I thought someone was bagging on the door. When I reached out to the host I got no response about the situation. I also found a used condom wrapper on top of the shower stall. Grossed me out.

There are a few inconveniences that kept it from being perfect (no outlet in the bathroom, thin walls) but overall would be happy to stay here again! Comfortable and clean, great value. :)"

Stayed a few nights","Annie’s place was a great stay for me and my friend’s weekend trip to San Jose. You get exactly what you pay for, and the space was the perfect size for 2 people. A single queen bed, full bath, sizable closet, TV (with streaming services), and the mini fridge/microwave was a lifesaver.
The room did get quite warm during the day, and the AC is not in unit rather central to the home. When asked Annie was able to turn it up. Upon arriving check in was easy, the room was clean, just some left behind trash and missing a few toiletries.
There was one night we were locked out of our room due to an issue with the keypad, and couldn’t get a hold of the host so we had to find an alternative place to stay for the night. We were let in the next morning, and Annie offered us a refund for the night missed.
All in all we really enjoyed our stay here, and would recommend it to others looking for a small affordable place."

Stayed one night","This is a nice room and a great location to stay in San Jose. However, some issues were that the handle in the shower was fixed to not go more than halfway, so the water was not very warm. In addition, there is no hand soap/shampoo or washcloths for washing hands, so be prepared to bring your own! The dog barks occasionally, but it’s not too bothersome. Other than that, I had a decent weekend stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was very nice and clean, and was exactly what I was looking for with a private room and bath. Unfortunately there were a few things that really affected my stay: first being the lack of hand soap in the bathroom (there was only a bottle of diluted hand sanitizer that had an odor, probably because they didn’t wash their hands before refilling it). Second is their dog consistently barks throughout the day AND NIGHT (once consistently from 3:00-3:20am). Lastly was the fact that they pinned their shower handle to not go over halfway for the temperature setting so I hope you like cold showers! But besides that it’s a nice room just keep those things in mind."

Stayed a few nights","The space was basically what it was described to be. Slightly less of an in-law's quarters than just a room with a door that led to the back yard but it worked for our purposes. The space was not as clean as we had hoped but it looked like the bathroom had simply not been cleaned since the last guest. We did ask for the host to clean more but they did not address all of the concerns. Otherwise the bed was comfortable which was a plus and it was nice to have access to the TV. My suggestion to anyone coming would be to bring your own washcloths and hand towels because only bath towels are provided. The price was good for the space, I just wish it had been cleaner."

The shampoo bottle was empty, and the hairdryer included in the amenities was missing. Bath towels are provided but not washcloths or hand towels. The temperature of the room was a bit warm, and the barking dog either in the house or the other guest house made for difficult sleeping conditions. This room may not be suitable for light sleepers. All in all, it was a nice place, although you may want to bring your own amenities to truly enjoy your stay."

Stayed a few nights","Annie's place is great if you're looking for just a short night stay and aren't too sensitive to noise. It has all you need, comfortable memory foam bed, tv, fridge, microwave. It is also located close to many restaurants and stores. Although these things were great I would like to add that the location isn't necessarily as advertised, be advised that the entrance is in the backyard (as advertised) but it isn't a separate unit like the description leads you to think. The room is actually connected to their own home on the bottom floor and there is another room right next to it which I think is being used for Airbnb as well. Because of this, you can hear everything from upstairs and from the room next door. It was difficult to sleep and noise (foot steps, vacuum, talking, cooking, etc) could be heard throughout the day Again, if you don't care about the noise then this would be a good place for you because of the simplicity and convenience this place has to offer."

I couldn't sleep throughout the night, but they were kind enough to extend my check out time. Again nice private room, and great location. Just need some noise cancelling options. Thank you!"

As advertised the room has its own very nice modern bathroom and private entrance. Self check in was super easy and instructions clear and timely. There is off street parking in the driveway in the front of the home. A microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer and iron are available in the room. (No coffee maker) You will need to provide your own shampoo, conditioner and soap. I had to text for a towel (there wasn’t one in the room when I arrived) and the response was immediate. I was quickly delivered a single bath towel, no hand towel or washcloth, so if you like to use a wash cloth you may want to bring one with you. The bed was very comfortable and an extra blanket was available in the closet. Fast WiFi. Room was more spacious than I expected. Back yard area to get to the room could use a little TLC, but hey I’m not sleeping out there. I will definitely stay here again if available on my next visit. Great stay. Thanks Annie!"

Stayed with kids","This treehouse made my 4 y/o and my dreams came true. Such an adorable place that was so different from any place else. It has all the basic amenities you need.
Puneet is friendly and responsive. I didn't realize how close the treehouse was to her home but it's ok, it was still very private. The view of the silicon valley was beautiful both during the day and night. There's not much to do on site. We roam the area a bit.
If you're a light sleeper, the branches may be disturbing if it's windy. Bring ear plugs. It got cold at night and hot during the day easily.
There's no actual lock for the door. Someone like me who even locks their own bedroom doors, I was a bit concerned. All in all, it was a nice stay and a wonderful experience. I'd recommend it and my son is already wanting to return."

The design of the treehouse was special, given there were huge branches of the living tree growing through the kitchen area. I appreciated all of the amble seating and a huge benefit was the full bathroom with plumbing. The place was clean and quaint. I liked the exterior deck but didn't get to use it much bc it was cold during our time there.
Our visit was during a very rainy, cold, and windy weekend so it was quite loud throughout our stay which could be bothersome to light sleepers.
Overall a fun and memorable experience!"

Stayed with kids","From my own personal experience, we had an okay stay. Let’s me make this clear, I understand that this is a treehouse experience for that you cannot control Mother Nature. However, we had a terrible experience. We booked this place thinking not much of the stormy weather because we booked maybe a month ago?. We were excited about this place. But due to weather conditions, with gust wind at 58mph, it shook the treehouse. For that, we weren’t getting any sleep so we left at 2:30am. Definitely was not worth it.
BUT, the host didn’t greet me with a message of thanks for booking, we struggled a bit to find light switch especially in pitch darkness & host did respond past the 1hr response time, one heater was not working, & no response/acknowledgement when we said we left at 2:30am or even updates on upcoming weather conditions.
For the price, $400+ definitely not worth it especially for one night for the little time we stayed.
Treehouse needs some interior designing but beautiful view."

Cons - no sheets? I did not understand why there were no sheets, and since we were only staying a night and tired I did not reach out about it. We just wrapped ourselves in the blankets as a burritos
For ~400$ per night, I expected attention to the cleanliness & definitely sheets without having to ask for them"

Stayed one night","What a gem! Great getaway on a weekend or just a long day after work. It’s treehouse on steroids. Very functional kitchen, 2 beds (be careful if you are tall), hot water, fridge, and getting to fall asleep with the sounds of crickets, cicadas and owls, plus occasionally raccoons fighting lol. It’s the closest you can experience nature while still being close to the city. Host is very responsive, directions are incredibly clear, except the wifi SSID wasn’t the same as the instructions stated but it was not hard to figure out. I’d say add the location of the light switches to the driveway lamps and the Christmas lights (they are beautiful but took me a bit!). I just wish it wasn’t so cloudy when I stayed cuz the stargazing would be amazing as there are minimal light pollution here.
Notes to those who are allergic to pollens tho: take your meds before. I was having a reaction so bad that it almost triggered my asthma. But it’s not the hosts fault. Just a little tip for future occupants."

Pros:
Host thought of and provided many additional amenities like AC, welcome gift, heaters, very stocked kitchen
Great outdoor seating options
Has running water & good hot water
Comfy beds
Cons:
Tight and short space for tall people
Need to be agile to get up into the beds
You can’t stand up straight in the shower if you’re over 5’5
The finishes aren’t great- bugs, spider webs, etc. which is somewhat expected in a treehouse but could have been cleaner"

My biggest surprise was the restroom and the size of the rooms. The bath/shower is small, I’m 5’6” and I had to hunch over a bit, but it was nice to have running hot water inside a treehouse!

A genuine labour of love and fascinating piece of engineering, but also very comfortable. There were even more amenities than expected when essentially staying in a tree!
Getting used to all the sounds of wildlife and the tree creaking takes a little getting used to, but we quickly found that the beauty of our surroundings outweighed that challenge.
All in all, a real diamond in the rough and i haven't seen much else on AirBnb that compares. Book this place now!"

Puneet was very responsive and gracious. We are so happy we stayed — we fell asleep counting stars and woke up to the sound of chirping birds. Really magical.

Stayed one night","The treehouse is much cuter in person. The space is organized and used well. The comforters were warm. There were snacks, coffee, pods, hot chocolate, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and bath towels available. It’s peaceful and beautiful there. It overlooks the city which is beautiful to see all the lights at night. We were able to watch a movie on the television. There were a few games there, but we didn’t play them. The bathroom had very good water pressure. Four of us women took showers, one after another, and still had plenty of hot water. I would say the only concern was one of the women felt she could slip on the ladder and suggested that something slip-proof be put on it. It was very relaxing and unique."

Stayed a few nights",You may think a treehouse isn’t a very glamorous place to spend your honeymoon and you would be right. It’s not glamorous. It’s pretty rustic. But it was so quaint and quite lovely. The view was spectacular. You have to be a bit agile to get in and out of the loft. And the spiral staircase was a little scary the first time up. But I quickly got the hang of it and had a wonderful time. We ventured out to the coast each day to different seaside towns.

Stayed one night","When you say treehouse - this goes way beyond. Leave the kids out of it for a second, the adults love it too. I set up a night for my teenage daughter and twin 10 year olds to surprise them for my 15 year olds bday. I had invited a couple of her friends as well. Everyone loved the location which is btw stunning with breathtaking views of the sunset over the valley, but also the fact that they could go up info a lofted treehouse with 2 BR 1 BA with a living room and kitchen (kitchenettes don’t have stoves but this one does!). Quirky, cute and unique - outfitted with the fun and extraordinary “never to forget” night:). I want to come back without my kids just for the quiet and the views:) We loved waking to the beautiful birds chirping:)"

Stayed with kids","This is a super cool and unique treehouse, even neater than I expected! And such a fun experience for my kids! Puneet even messaged us before arriving to ask if we wanted to pick another date to stay because it was rainy and windy, which we thought was so kind of her. But, we were on a ""coast trip"" and only had one day in the area so we had to do it that night. It was very cold in the bay and because the treehouse doesn't have heat, we used the 4 space heaters Puneet provided. It was still very chilly, we couldn't get the temperature inside above 58 at night. I still give it 5 stars because Puneet can't control the weather and she was so flexible. If the weather had been nice, I couldn't recommend this place more! What kid (and adult for that matter) doesn't want to spend the night in a real treehouse?!"

It's not posh or luxurious, but clean and comfortable and a little rustic which adds to the charm. The views from the loft are amazing, especially at night. It was a little chilly in the evening, even with the 3 space heaters provided--so you may want to bring some extra blankets. Our 2 yo and 5 yo loved nearby Happy Hollow Park & Zoo. We would definitely recommend this treehouse. Such a unique and memorable experience!"

Our family of 4 (children aged 7 and 3.5) spent much of our time naming all the things we were doing in a tree (""I'm brushing my teeth in a tree! I'm eating oatmeal in a tree!"") and lounging in the cozy sleeping loft reading from the full Magic Treehouse book series. We were there in the heavy rains of Jan 2023, and appreciated Puneet's full transparency about what it would be like to stay under those conditions. We were up for the adventure and had a fantastic time. It created very fond family memories that we talk about on the daily!!"

I didn’t know all the bedrooms are in up stairs. I did have a very hard time to get up and down. But it didn’t stop me to sleep up there !
We had wonderful time to celebrate my birthday there.
We had cakes and pizzas. We talked and also watched some TV.
I felt my dream came true.

Stayed a few nights","“The nest” was so incredibly cute! The decor inside matched the theme of birds quite well. The view was also amazing. Since I came during winter, most of the leaves had fallen, but I got a great view of the South Bay instead.
Paneet’s place was clean, and it had everything I needed, including complimentary snacks and drinks, 3 space heaters to keep the place warm in the winter, and plenty of pillows and blankets. The shower worked very well. I was very comfortable.
The surrounding area is very quiet and great for walking especially in the morning. Just be careful of cars as there are no sidewalks.
The only thing I wasn’t used to was not really hearing from Paneet. She was responsive when I asked her a question, but other than that, she didn’t message me to hear if I got in ok or to give any checkout procedures, which I was used to from previous Airbnb hosts. However, it wasn’t a big deal since I didn’t have any problems with the place.
It makes for a lovely staycation!"

We did take a few pics outside, which did feel a little odd since it’s right in front of their home. But, once we got inside, we stayed inside the rest of the night! It felt very private. The beds were clean and comfortable. It has all your basic necessities! I love that she also included disposable utensils and plates! There’s enough light and plugs everywhere. We did go during winter time, so it was pretty chilly even with the space heaters! So just make sure you bundle up and bring extra blankets just in case the comforters are not enough. Maybe someday me and my husband will have to come back without the kids. Haha"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Puneet's tree house was a magical once-in-a-lifetime experience with a panoramic view of San Jose. We sat in the tree top watching the beautiful subset over the San Jose Bay Area. At the same time the house is remarkably large, it has two bedrooms which appear to have somewhat Queen-bed size, and a common sitting area below it. It we well-built with fingerprints of an (decidedly semi-)professional tree house architect on it. All the extras and details make it magical and cozy.
We only had one non-magical incident in it, when on Saturday morning at 11m there were suddenly gardener with leaf blowers below. That definitely took out part of magic on that day."

My twin 10 years old daughters and us, the grownups were absolutely amazed at how comfortable the treehouse was, how much they fit in there and had every amenity possible. It is very well thought out. The TWO queen beds were extremely comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked and we really appreciated the complimentary snacks and drinks. There was a coffee maker, a microwave, a stove, all utensils and cups and plates. Everything you might need. There were 3 heaters and it did get cold in the night so they came in handy. The bathroom size was surprising - I did not expect it to be as big as it is. The shower was lovely. We had to keep reminding ourselves we were in a treehouse! It's an amazing place - I already told everyone at our kids' school and in our offices about it - it is definitely an experience to be had. Thank you, Puneet for a memorable experience."

It was everything you need with a shower, bathroom, microwave, fridge and the bottles of water/soda were a nice touch. The lofts upstairs was a fun space to spend the evening talking, reading and looking out the window at the incredible view. My son loved it so much he was teary eyed when he had to go home.

This is our second time here and the first time we were here my kids did not stop talking about it to some degree until a year later when we came back. And now, you guessed it - they have not stopped talking about this trip either.
It is a magical wonderland dream of a treehouse that has a thousand nooks and crannies and cubby holes and hidden little places with twinkle lights that you won’t even see until you have been there at least 5 times.
So, yes - we are going back. And back. And back..."

Stayed one night","The sunset over Silicon Valley is M-A-G-I-C! Highly recommended for a romantic getaway or a weekend stay with elementary school kids. The space is not huge but highly functional, with kitchenette, bathroom etc. The staircase is narrow and storage space is limited so duffle bags work better than suitcases. The treehouse features large windows so the morning lights may wake you up, and the open lofts offer somewhat limited privacy. If you enjoy sleeping on a boat or camping/glamping you will love the experience for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Such a unique experience! Glamping on a whole new level! Ordering delivery to a treehouse was an item on my bucket list I didn’t know existed! Furnishings are mini-sized, like in an RV. It was a surprise for our girls and the reaction I got when we pulled up the driveway and they saw the treehouse was awesome! The beds are foam, so you may want to consider bringing a foam mat to put on top for a better night sleep. Lovely attention to detail in the decorations and snacks. The history of the treehouse is hung in the bedroom. Curtains are sheer, so if you are staying in summer you may consider bringing a sleeping mask. We can’t wait to go back!!"

Stayed over a week","when I checked into Ann's place, my first initial thought was that it looked clean, but when I started to unpack, I noticed that the floor was not cleaned, and the door jams were very dusty, corner walls had cobwebs. the drawers at the foot of the bed with extra pillows had not been cleaned for a very long time, and the pillows had dust and dead bugs on them. The kitchen stove was not cleaned well . I contacted Ann, showed her pictures, and her response was that the place was cleaned and that what I was showing her were minimal issues.
The kitchen did not have enough pots and / or serving utensils. there was no dish rack, drying towels, cleaning supplies, the sponge in the kitchen was old. There was only street parking and it was hard to find a space close to the house and your parking on a hill. The heater was controlled by the main house. There was a door in the bathroom that connects to the main house, and you can sometimes hear people talking. It's not worth the price"

As soon as we walked in there was a foul smell coming from the garbage disposal. I messaged the host who took a while to respond and they simple told me it was odd and to run the water. There was absolutely no cleaning supplies so I could try and spray something in there. This place was dirty. The oven, fridge, stained walls and dust build up every where. The window was disgusting. It also had the bare minimum in kitchen supplies. We ended up leaving early. Do yourself a favor and stay some where else."

Stayed a few nights","Ann's place was great! For transparency, it is a garage converted into a living space, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom, though it was literally perfect. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots and pans as well as an abundance of spices and cooking basics. The full-sized fridge and gas stove was an amazing touch and considerate, as most hosts I've seen only include mini-sized fridges when they mention a full-sized kitchen. Everything was thoughtfully put together--there was even a Keurig with two different types of coffee pods to use! Because the bathroom shares a wall with another living space and the quiet time started a little early, we did have to be a bit conscious of noise but if you're using the Airbnb to travel during the day then it won't be a big problem at all. The check-in was very smooth as well. Only bit worth mentioning is that you have to park on the street, which we were a little unlucky with for the last two nights and had to park a little far. Otherwise, amazing stay in SJ!"

I learned the hard way not to use the portable heater & microwave at the same time *smh* Totally my fault.
I sent a message to Ann and she replied almost immediately that she would be home to reset the fuse box as it’s located inside the home. I thought that was beyond sweet & super generous considering how it was NYE and she was most likely out enjoying herself. Not to mention the quiet neighborhood & soft bed made for a very peaceful night.
Thank you Ann!! Good way to start off the New Year! 😊"

I felt fur , like Kat fur or something like that. And when I removed the towel from my face the inside was dirty with what looked like cat hairs. I left it on the counter so you guys can see.
I literally only came here to sleep.
I had that fur all over my face and stick to my lips and all."

Stayed a few nights","This AirBnB was a really good stay and the space is super cute! It is much smaller than it looked in the pictures and the walls were thin enough to hear our neighbors full conversations. It not a spot if you are looking to hang out in your AirBnB for extended lengths of time. The parking was difficult and we often parked several blocks away during our stay and choosing the right street to park on is a definite must.
Lastly, the amenities were less than I’ve come to expect with AirBnB stays lately, there was a random bottle of shampoo in the shower but no body wash or soap. There was also random food and condiments in the fridge but nothing cohesive and a decently amount of kitchen utensils, but everything seemed like items left from past stays. The washer and dryer was a bonus, especially since we were there for a hockey tournament.
Overall, I would say this was a good stay for its price especially if you are flying solo. I would stay here again but would come more prepared."

You can heard the cars going by in the neighborhood (not a lot, but audible), the neighbor upstairs walking around, the adjacent unit using the shower / doing laundry, and in the morning, children playing outside from the elementary school across the street. I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, so once I fell asleep it didn't post an issue, but I'd keep this in mind and bring a pair of ear plugs if you are on the lighter sleeper side of things."

Heater worked great when it got cold at night. Quiet downstairs area. We couldn’t find who had the laundry sitting all day and night so we weren’t able to wash our clothes unfortunately."

Stayed a few nights","This was a lovely place to stay for a long weekend! It was very clean, cool vibe, and the host is very responsive. The only downsides were that the walls are very thin. You can hear the neighbors’ conversations with 100% clarity through the wall, so if you go to bed early or are a light sleeper this might not be for you. We were there for a concert and getting back late, so it wasn’t a huge issue for us but definitely worth noting. Additionally, the proximity of the neighborhood to downtown and other cool restaurants was awesome, but the area is a little rough. As two women, we were comfortable walking around in the daytime but definitely would recommend taking Ubers or Lyfts at night. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again!"

I really like that it felt secure and cozy in the back of the house away from everyone else. We had events at the SAP center and its about a half hour walk to get there. I will say that in the downtown San Jose area in general there is a lot of homeless and to make sure to walk with a group or take an Uber at night if you are uncomfortable. Clifton was a great host and the space was exactly as advertised. Thanks for making our trip so much better!

If we had known that the place was the size of an average walk in closet, we would have book somewhere else. The photos are very misleading. The only thing I can says is that the place was clean."

There was a keurig available but the pod holder was pretty gunked up with something. There was clean linen and towels so that was nice.

You could hear the downstairs unit next to you and then upstairs you heard everywhere they walked. The quiet hours are after 10pm and the ppl upstairs were in heels dancing or walking around at 3am.

Stayed one night","I gave 5 stars for everything. I do want to provide some notes on my experience that I feel would be useful:
1) the walls are thin so I could hear next door conversations extremely clearly from the bedroom (I believe I did see previous reviews state such). After 10pm I no longer heard any conversations so it wasn't a problem once it got near time to sleep.
2) there was occasional dog parking from neighboring house. I was initially worried it would get out of hand but never did. At night time, didn't hear a peep from the dog.
3) the unit is on the bottom floor so footsteps from top are audible. Once it hit night time it was never a problem
4) I was a bit bummed I couldn't fill up the tub (not allowed due to overflow) so standing shower only.
5) I went to an event and got back home at 10pm and ended up not finding parking nearby, street parking was full at night (this was just one night I experienced but should be expected since everyone is back home). During the day, I was able to easily park in the front.
The following overrides all of the above:
6) super awesome price and no crazy cleaning markup cost. I think the owner takes into account everything and prices it very well IMO.
7) place is extremely clean, modern and trendy. It is compact cozy spot and is how I imagined from the pics it would be.
8) convenient check in process. I didn't have to communicate at all with the owner because everything was streamlined. Internet password comes in email and door opens and locks via August app. Easy come and easy go.
9) great location for my needs. 10mins to all the spots I needed to go to.
Conclusion: when I need a place, I want one to myself and just need the primary things of... cleanliness, easy access and a place where I can get a full nights sleep which I got. Mission accomplished."

If you’re looking for somewhere in San Jose that is both attractive and close to everything this may be one of your best bets!"

Was in need of some cool air at one point but stayed cool for most part. Also just a reminder, if you order food the deliverer is most likely going to have a hard time dropping it off correctly. Spent 10 minutes cluelessly walking around outside until we found our food left at the house next door. But overall, loved the place and how private it was. Would love to stay there again!"

We loved the layout and design but it was also extremely functional. Clifton was an amazing host and got back to us immediately. We used an app to gain entrance and it was super easy. The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved the huge walk in closet with a dresser as I love to completely unpack. We rode our electric bikes all around downtown and a bit on the Guadalupe river trail. Would recommend the San Pedro Square Market downtown t eat. It’s got a cool vibe and lots of choices. We would definitely recommend staying at one of Cliftons places as it is Airbnb done right!

Stayed one night","I will begin this review by saying I don’t think it’s Clifton’s fault. He was polite and responsive. The apartment was lovely and beautifully decorated.
However, and a BIG one, the place is on a bottom floor (basement like) and adjacent to another rented unit. The walls are incredibly thin and we could hear every sound from the neighbors. Which is fine if they’re nice neighbors. However, when you have neighbors who throw a party, blast music, shout constant expletives, and bang who knows what furniture until well past 3AM, and then decide to recap the evening at 8AM, it’s nothing short of a hellhole. Clifton was responsive but couldn’t do anything and we ended up not sleeping most of the night.
I don’t know that you’d have a poor experience given they were temporary residents, but it could be a roll of the dice."
