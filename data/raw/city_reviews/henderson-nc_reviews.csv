Stayed with kids","This place is stunning! Our family had the best time. We were in the area for a wedding and this was a beautiful, peaceful and cozy lake house with an amazing view to escape the chaos. The house has everything you need : plenty of linens, washer/dryer, iron, traditional ground coffee maker, ice maker in the freezer, water spout in the fridge, pack n play, full size baby crib+mattress, sound machine and the most cozy screened porch. All the beds are so comfortable. Amanda was a great host and quick to respond. It was clean and inviting from the first time we opened the door. We will definitely be back again."

Stayed a few nights","The house was just as described (btw the ceiling height is unbelievable). The kitchen was decently equipped and the amenities offered helped make us feel at home. I appreciated having Google home to help control the thermostat and be able to see the view of the camera on the front porch. David was an extremely responsive host all the times I reached out.
Again, the house itself was exactly what I expected. It is such a shame that issues outside the homeowner's control caused such problems for me. There were cars across the intersection with loud music/bass going beginning in the evening hours of my first full day there and then continued throughout on the second full day there. Thankfully the Henderson PD was always willing to drive by which helped to pause the noise for a while."

Stayed with a pet","All our expectations were exceeded. We had everything we needed plus a lot more. The house is great! It is clean, cozy and the property is beautiful. We really enjoyed the kayaks and fishing off the dock. Kerr Lake is really beautiful and more quiet than most lakes. We are dog people and love taking our pup wherever we go and he loved it here. He could freely roam from the deck to the fenced yard where he could do his zoomies. Big plus that a crate was available so we did not have to pack one. The kitchen is well appointed to allow for cooking all kinds of meals. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return soon."

Bedrooms are very comfortable. We slept like rocks every night. The kitchen is very well stocked with everything you’ll need (minus food). We swam in the lake every day and night - the stars were incredible. We rented a boat from Steele Creek and parked it at the dock which was so convenient. Best Airbnb experience ever. We will be back!"

Stayed with a pet","I think that this was probably the most pet friendly house we’ve ever stayed in! The dogs had the freedom to be on the deck and go to the fenced in yard without us having to worry about them getting loose or running off to who knows where!
The house was fantastic to stay in with a well stocked kitchen and comfortable beds and furniture! It was a short easy walk to the boat dock and we loved the fire pit stocked with dry wood! S’mores for the grandkids were a hit. Our stay was so enjoyable that the only bad thing I can think of is that it went by way too fast! We’ll definitely be back at the Great Escape!"

Our fur babies were greeted with a treat from Kim and really enjoyed exploring the property. It was nice to not worry about anything because everything was available for us. Thank you so much for allowing us to use your beautiful home. We plan on returning next year.

A lot of homes claim to be pet friendly, but this home truly welcomes your pets as members of the family. The short walk down to the lake is well maintained. The swimming area was quiet despite being adjacent to a boat launch. Our family looks forward to a week long lake stay every year, and this home truly went beyond expectation. I highly recommend this home to anyone looking to enjoy a worry and stress free lake vacation."

Kim was very responsive, the house was immaculate, and they even left dog treats, a water bowl, several leash options and toys for your four legged travelers. My kids had a blast on the kayaks, we loved the gas firepit and the porch was a wonderful place to star gaze at night. This definitely was a Great Escape!"

Group trip","Even better than we expected. Not sure where to start. The house (and wrap around porch) is adorable and well maintained. Large front yard for family games. Amazing back yard with screened in porch, unscreened deck area with sitting area, grill, table…PLUS a lower fire pit area. Nice marked (lighted) path down to the water. When we arrived we were surprised to find everything already stocked (Spices, condiments, toiletries in every bathroom, paper products, bug spray, sunscreen, towels (bath, lake and dog)…you name it!) We even walked in to a bottle of wine and dog treat for our pup as well as s’mores and inflatable tubes ready to go. The porch was perfectly gated for the dog and the crate provided even fit our 115 lb mastiff puppy. The house/dock is on a lovely and quiet cove where we spent 90% of our time floating and fishing. 100% would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","This is an absolutely beautiful and well-maintained home. The host included so many thoughtful amenities, including a stocked kitchen with every utensil we needed for the many nights of meals we cooked. The deck is fantastic - large enough to comfortably accommodate a crowd for dinner. We enjoyed the fire pit every night and the complimentary s'mores ingredients were a lovely extra we did not expect! It is an easy walk down to the lake and the dock, we rented a boat for several days and docked it at the house, making it very easy to enjoy the water. We also had an infant, which normally would be a struggle, but the house was full of unique and thoughtful amenities for babies too, including a play gate, baby gates at each stair and a pack'n'play. The hosts were great, communicated frequently, answered our many questions and clearly take great pride in their home. We are 100% coming back!"

We love having our fur family join us on vacations and this house/property are perfect for that! The house was very clean and had all amenities you could ask for. There were ample paper products, soap, spices, firewood, etc. Kim thought of everything! We enjoyed the fire feature on the deck in the mornings and the sunsets/firepit in the evenings. Midday, we sat on the deck under the umbrella, swam in the lake and took the canoe out on the water. We rented a pontoon boat from nearby Steele Creek Marina to explore a larger section of the lake. The front of the property is a large open area where we were able to play Frizbee and fetch with our dogs.
We look forward to visiting this haven on Kerr Lake again!"

Stayed with kids","Kim’s place is truly one of our favorite rental experiences yet. They thought of everything, from turning on the porch lights for our arrival to stocking the pantry with s’mores and sticks, everything we could have needed to enjoy this property was in place and ready to go. The property is set back in a little cove protected from the main lake, and the kids had a blast swimming and floating around, looking for seashells and exploring the wooded shore. We rented a pontoon from nearby Steele Creek Marina and explored the lake’s many little nooks and sandy beaches. The dock is located down a well-maintained path through the Corps land, and the house comes with a handy tow cart that we used to drag down rafts, life jackets, and coolers—they thought of everything. We will definitely be keeping an eye on this property for a return trip!"

Night time was so incredibly quiet and the sky was so clear I saw a few shooting stars.
The reservoir is stocked with trout and using the gear included I caught one and had an unexpected tasty snack!
I wish I had had the time to take the kayak out.
It was immaculately clean and had plenty of necessities in the kitchen including salt, sugar, spices, butter, mustard, coffee, etc, etc, etc.
The master bed was very comfortable.
I have no complaints except that I didn't stay long enough."

Stayed with a pet","Ron has gone above and beyond to share this little slice of heaven with the world! We went to a wedding in Oxford and stayed at Ron’s home and we loved it so much we stayed an extra night! It is peaceful, EXTREMELY well stocked with anything you might need, and just downright gorgeous. It is also extremely private if you are traveling for a romantic getaway or with a dog! Ron is incredibly nice and accommodating. We can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed with a pet","Driving up to the lake cabin you immediately feel positive energy, the weeks stress melts away and the relaxation begins.
The view of the lake should be on a post card. The house is beautiful, charming and well stocked with anything you might need. The fishing poles were a pleasant surprise.
There is room for everyone both indoor and outside.
Ron is a wonderfully attentive , responsive host who is just a call away. He checked on us and texted local events that we should check out.
Ron’s home is the perfect relaxation spot. We will definitely come back."

Stayed with a pet","We loved this little hideaway on Fox Pond in Henderson. The cabin has a wonderful rustic feel, with walls and ceilings adorned with pine (we think it is pine) shiplap. The flooring, a faux wood tile, was perfect for our dogs, one of whom is getting up in age and needs grip to get up and go.The residence is tastefully decorated with antiques, including a really cool vintage wood stove. The home features state-of-the-art appliances and all the comforts that helps one feel at home, including a well-stocked kitchen and laundry room. The home sits on the banks of body of water that seems more than a pond, with the scale of a small lake or a reservoir. Sip your morning coffee from the front porch while enjoying a serene view of the lake, which is teeming with beautiful water fowl, including blue herons, ducks, and geese. We went on wonderful walks each morning around the lake on a well groomed trail in the midst of a pine and hardwood forest. We highly recommend Ron's Fox Pond retreat if you need a family friendly quiet retreat."

We wish we could stay longer. If you want to get away from town, but still be close, this is a super option. The wildlife is abundant. Turkeys, deer, geese, herons, ducks, woodchucks, turtles & more, fireflies at night. Overall a very pleasant stay."

This area really doesn’t have that much as far as scenic places to stay, the pickings are slim. However, this was such a quaint and perfect day for what we needed! It was super clean, and exactly as described! We were very comfortable, felt safe, and if we had to go to this area again, would definitely want to stay once more! That highly recommend, if you’re visiting the area for any reason! Especially instead of a hotel! She was great at communicating if we needed anything, andfelt like the accommodations were five star!"

Appliances are brand new and of high end. Technically, all you need is your toothbrush and the food you like. Wonderful place, very convenient to the lakes around, which we were boating on. Plenty of parking for a boat or camper and several cars. Great BBQ grill is gas charged, cleaned and ready to fire up. Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. We had a perfect weekend and will be back next year.
The only thing we would add, is the fire pit in the back yard, for kids to do Smores or to have a comfy camp fire:)). Hope to see it next time.
Other than that, thank you Sybil for a great hospitality standard.
Definitely recommend!!!"

Craig was very accommodating when I noticed that I had booked the wrong date. We were able to change the reservation within a couple hours which was very much appreciated. The house itself was easy to check into and was spotless. We were even able to check in earlier than anticipated! The beds were were comfortable and the pillows were surprisingly nice. There is also plenty of space to park if you're traveling in a group. I was surprised that their were streaming services available on the TV or guest use. The internet was fast and the house is within driving distance of everything you would want to do in Henderson NC. Overall, if I returned to the area I would absolutely return to the house."

We tried to rent paddle boards and find a captain to take us out on to the lake but were unsuccessful. We enjoyed playing games, watching movies and sitting by the fire pit."

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect place to spend a week with our family! The house has a wonderful layout for cooking and playing board games together. Between two families, we are a crew with kids aged 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. They all especially enjoyed the loft and the games in the basement! The house was clean and comfy and well stocked with everything we needed, from lots of linens to extra lifejackets. We had a great time making smores and kayaking on the lake. Rob and Michael were very responsive whenever we had questions, and also provided a fantasic guest book for us to peruse and prepare before we got there. We may have just found our new family summer tradition!"

It was clean, beautifully decorated, and easy to access. The cove that leads out to the lake is easy to find with convenient access to the nearest boat ramp. We look forward to another visit in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely, clean home way out in the country. A great property for a family getaway, girlfriend retreat. Good speed for internet. TV set up was nice. Fun games in basement.
Property is not conducive to a work retreat due to the dining room chairs (only two and benches) and for long work sessions it doesn't work. Elderly people should be aware there is a small grade and stairs from parking lot into home. It is a short walk to the lake.
Bring bug spray - you are in the edge of the woods."

We enjoyed the peace and quiet away from home. We played games, watched movies, grilled out, made a fire, roasted s’mores, and took our boat out on the lake. The kids got adventurous and enjoyed exploring in the nearby woods.
The house is freshly updated and very clean and you can tell the hosts worked hard to make it comfortable. We knew being at the lake would mean we would need to bring and cook most of our meals. The kitchen was perfect for that, had all that we needed and made it easy to prepare dinner. We also went out to eat a few times; the local Mexican restaurant is very tasty and has a fun environment. If you’re looking for a quiet, cozy, and clean place to retreat, this is a perfect place for that!"

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful time at Cypress Cove! The house was small, but perfect for my husband, myself and our 2-year-old. The view from the living room is beautiful, even better from the dock. Especially at sundown.
Everything was clearly laid out in their house manual and instructions and it wasn't overly complicated. The house is well-supplied with utensils, dishes, Tupperware, baking and cooking pans.
Beth even left us a bag of popcorn and some chocolates, which we enjoyed during movie night, after our son went to sleep!
The walk down to the water is a bit far, but nothing too difficult. Just a few minute walk at most. The water is pretty shallow at the dock, and even for a ways out. It was nice for us because our son could walk around in the water.
I will say, if you are afraid of fish, it might not be the best place. There are tons of small fish that poke and nibble at your legs and feet when you're near the dock. Not so much far out in the water, lol.
Overall, a great trip! :)"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Cypress Cove Cottage @ Kerr Lake was very enjoyable. The surroundings were beautiful. Great lake access. We brought our kayaks and could easily put them in at the shoreline if we were so inclined. There were beautiful sunsets and lots of wildlife. Seriously, there were deer, blue birds, osprey, great blue herons and a massive great horned owl that started hunting in the back yard at dusk. It was hot for our stay so we took some drives in the country. We went into Oxford, NC a couple of times and ate at Strong Arm Bakery and Harvest Restaurant - very good for lunch. The cottage was as advertised - charming 50's cottage. Great screened in porch on the back with wonderful views. It felt very private. Good ac and fans everywhere. Comfortable living room furniture and well-appointed kitchen. The cleanest vacation rental we have ever been in in all our years of travel. The bathrooms are small but get the job done. Would recommend for a couple's getaway!"

House was immaculate and had everything we needed to make ourselves right at home. Beds were comfortable, kitchen was well-stocked with all of the essentials. We enjoyed the views of the lake and the local birds (lots of blue birds on the property and saw my first summer tanager on the nature trail) and other wildlife (saw a few deer feeding at the wood line) as we relaxed on the porch with coffee in the early morning."

After spending a long day on the water, it was so nice to come and crash in the comfy reclining couch and watch the sunset over the water. Beth is such a responsive and kind host, a nasty storm came through and knocked power out in the area and Beth offered to bring us flashlights and candles and provided us updates on the power returning. The storm also bent the dock umbrella over and they had it replaced within our stay. We cannot wait to come back next summer!"

Stayed a few nights","She was extremely responsive and flexible. Added a day last minute when I decided to leave earlier for the trip, and we got in around 2 AM. Wonderful decorating touch, the beds were very comfortable. Woke a few hours later and happy to find a Keurig waiting for me. When I walked outside, again she decorates wonderfully and found an amazing view and the lake right there. She had a nice book of suggestions, and even though I have been to this area many times I tried a restaurant for breakfast she had listed and it was very good. I came down for a wedding and met up with friends who also drove down for the wedding; during the meal everyone was complaining about how dirty the hotel was. They paid more per night to stay than I had at Scott's. Another great thing about the location of the place is as you pull out of her place, take a right, it is a short drive to I 85 which connects you to everything. All in all I will definitely stay here again; I loved it."

The unit is exactly as it appears in the photos, and the lakeside location is easy to access. What made this stay special is that Scott has thought of *everything.* She's labeled the appliances and light switches, with perfectly placed and well-written instructions on how to use them. A book at the entrance provides instructions on using the apartment and local sites and food. She left out s'mores fixins and there are pre-bundled loads of firewood and marshmallow skewers all located easily and intuitively. (The s'mores were delicious btw!) The shower was clean and lots of toiletries were available in case we forgot something. My friend and I -- and our dogs! -- appreciated the beauty and serenity of Angler's Den and have every intention of booking there again. Thank you for everything, Scott!"

they really think of everything to make you feel better than home.
we didn't wanted to leave, the view was amazing 😍 we enjoyed everything the paddle boat, BBQ, sunsets, had everyday breakfast outside enjoying the view.
we burn wood 🪵 and marshmallows at night.
the owners live in the second floor,
but they give you full privacy at all times.
we really enjoyed our stay ❤️ don't think about it too much ! and booked 🙌 won't regret it.

Stayed with a pet",Our stay was exactly what we wanted and needed. Honestly it exceeded our expectations. The place was beautiful and very special. No matter if we wanted to be inside or outside both were perfect 😁 Definitely a win win no matter what. We were ready to come back after only being there for 30 minutes. The special details went on and on… we received a welcome to the house card. Then on my birthday they left a bottle of wine on the porch with a card. Seriously they went above and beyond

Stayed with a pet",I can’t say enough good things about this place. It’s absolutely beautiful and so relaxing. Scott is a great host and so friendly. Everything we needed was provided! We came for a wedding shower we were helping with and I had no issues with doing all my cooking prep. The kitchen is stocked nicely and the foodi air fryer oven works perfectly. We will be back often! Our little Lainey doodle felt right at home and enjoyed playing on the waterfront and the big backyard area.

The hosts themselves were friendly but non-intrusive. Very easy to talk with and shoot the breeze!
The actual place itself was very inviting and well-put together. Custom made furniture that I haven't seen before to be honest.
Nothing out of place.....................and everything you need and more.
All high quality and well-designed.
I have stayed in hundreds of houses, airbnbs, vrbos, hotels..........and I can honestly say this place was at the top.
Book this place before the world finds out about it!!"

I have been staying in other people's homes for more than a decade with AirBnB and this was by far a rare bad experience of misinformation and one excuse after another. This host answered my direct, pre-booking, question about heavy use of air-freshers in the house with a bald-faced lie. She sent me a welcome message with an invalid cell phone number and a claim of driveway parking which in fact was not available without a special request. Even my final message, letting the host know that I couldn't bear to stay the second pre-paid night due to noxious smells in the house, was answered with a long explanation of how it was all my fault. Thankfully, I found a last minute booking for another room nearby in Youngsville and I had a wonderful stay there."

Stayed one night","The attention to detail was impressive. Anything that you could've possibly needed because you forgot were available, right down to not just one, but two toothbrushes. Tiniesha was also very flexible and accommodated me even though my plans were a little off from the norm. I would recommend this place, especially to anyone traveling along I-85 as a place to rest."

Stayed one night","A good place to rest your head for a night for an appropriate price. The cancelation flexibility is much appreciated. It seems it is a new place and was clean and safe; a work in progress with furnishing but it seems more was being added currently. Not by fault of the host, but the walls are very thin so even a full phone conversation can be heard, and the neighborhood kids/wildlife were loud until around 11pm. I wouldn't recommend for the light sleeper, nor to someone with back problems due to the bed - it's not terrible just thin, and we slept decently. I was there volunteering in the community overnight and it worked just fine for our one night. Tiniesha seems polite and responsive, we did not see her but were texted the instructions on how to enter when we were physically at the door so I assume her doorbell camera is how she knows you have arrived. We did not spend time in the common area but the fridge had plenty of space for a small takeout box we kept overnight. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Tiniesha's home was immaculately clean, and there was a large shared space with a comfy couch, some activities, and a nice kitchen. Getting in was easy and our room was definitely worth the price we paid. Plenty of nice, clean towels and the bathroom was spotless.
I stayed here while taking a class at Vance-Granville Community College and this was an affordable, super-convenient option only 5 minutes from campus. about 10 minutes to a Wal-Mart and good selection of fast food in Henderson. We ate dinner at Mazatlan Mexican Restaurant nearby and I'd definitely recommend that place too.
If I visit the Henderson area again I will definitely come back."

Stayed one night","Tiniesha's place was great, if you're looking to stay a long time or just passing thru her house is a great choice. She was super flexible about me checking in late since I was driving from super far away and everything was exactly how it is in the pictures. I had everything I needed to nap, take a shower and head to my next destination, so I will definitely stay here again if I plan to drive to the Carolinas again."

The bathroom was my favorite part. It's beautiful. The shower pressure is a dream. It looks even better in person than it does in the pictures.

Stayed a few nights","Lake Leisure is the perfect name for this location. It looks brand new on the inside and it is so well done. The view was breathtaking. The layout of the home and the yard leading to the lake felt like we were secluded, with our own sanctuary, even with neighbors close by. I always feel like there is safety in numbers, so it was the best of both worlds. We felt like we had the whole lake to ourselves but knew that if we happened to need anything we were not alone.
Vanessa has thought of everything. It absolutely felt like a home away from home. I love all little helpful notes and the notebook she made for guests was so convenient and helpful. We want to come back again and again. I highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at this lake house was great! The house is beautiful inside and out, and true to the pictures on the website. We loved the view of the lake and took a lot of family photos. We had plenty of room for our family of 8. The bedrooms are very roomy, and the beds are very comfortable. There are a lot of pots and pans for cooking and plates, cups, etc. If you have a lengthier stay, I recommend buying laundry & dishwashing pods/detergent, as well as a small bottle of dishwashing liquid for washing dishes manually. There is a Walmart about 10 minutes away, which is convenient. The house is at the end of a road, so there is plenty of privacy, but it is not secluded, as there are other houses nearby. For guests’ safety, there is a motion-activated camera in front of the house, which records all video and audio outside of the screen door. Amanda was a great hostess and responded quickly to questions. I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay again!"
