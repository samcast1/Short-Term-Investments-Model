Stayed a few nights",The location as wonderful and the place was very cute and comfortable. I feel like the communication could’ve been a bit clearer as we advised the host we would be likely arriving at 6 am and they initially said we could arrange our stay to pay for the extra day and when we arrived that morning they wouldn’t let us check in until 10:15 am. We had to sit in our car in front for 2 hours after traveling all night. Other than that the place was well worth the price and very comfortable

They were both fantastic salt of the earth people and even brought us a hot breakfast the next morning. You won’t be disappointed to stay amongst blackberries and blueberries, friendly dogs, and the birds to wake you in the morning we loved it. And a wind chime to put you to sleep!!!!"

Stayed one night","We should've booked a longer stay!
One, passing-through night at this idyllic country location is just not enough. Do yourself a favour and sample the real world - the original escape from whatever ails you in a quick-paced, modern environment - at Alma and Jason's Fresh Fruits Farm for a few nights or more.
Alma's and Jason's descriptions of 'FFF' are accurate and faithful, but they're also understated - try describing peace, tranquillity, normality and exceedingly tasty omelette in your average Air BnB ad. We loved our single night stay here, wish we'd stayed longer.
Incidentally, McComb is a lovely and quaint wee town that offers more then you'd imagine; also wished we'd had more time to take it in.
Thanks, A&J
Best wishes, Kenny & Patti (Glasgow, Scotland)"

It's rustic, so if the outside coming in doesn't bother you, it was a cute place. We got there after dark, so it was a little hard to find even with the instructions provided; we accidentally missed the turnoff to the drive and had to circle back."

Alma works hard to ensure her guests feel welcome and enjoy their stay. I am short and a little immobile and had a little difficulty climbing into the tall bed, but everything else was good. The cottage is rustic, but clean, comfortable and well stocked. It is true to the description and the pictures. Don’t hesitate to book this home! Thank you for sharing your farm with us!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a most peaceful and beautiful location. Very private and well off the road and away from traffic noise. At night (when it’s clear obviously), the stars are vibrant and visible. Even the “tiny” ones. If that’s your thing. But, who doesn’t like looking at God’s magnificent solar system, right? I spend most of my nights sitting outside in the back of my truck staring at the sky. (Chairs work too 😉)
Breakfast is hand made and hot upon delivery. None of that “heat it up out of the box” stuff. Very filling and tasty.
Ms. Alma is always quick to respond with any questions, if you have any, and makes sure that the initial check in is most pleasant and easy accessible.
This my second time staying, and surely not my last. A true sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle, nosy big city life."

Stayed a few nights","This was absolutely the most peaceful and quiet place I have stayed. To include my own home. Far enough off the road that you could not hear traffic going by. It is very secluded from others, yet such wide open space that you can just feel the nature.
There was a hot breakfast waiting on me when I woke up. A ham and cheese omelet with hash browns and biscuits. My favorite. I felt at home.
Unfortunately, my trip wasn’t for vacation this go around, but I have definitely found a new “go to” location when I am home visiting family in the area.
If you are looking for a quiet get-away from all of the hustle and bustle and just need to clear your mind, or just passing through and need some rest in a very comfortable bed before the next hitch of the trip, this IS the place."

We loved sitting on the swing looking out over the beautiful field with black-eyed Susans in the foreground and grand trees in the distance. Then having breakfast on the screened in porch. She made some of the most delightful blueberry muffins that I've had. We had a nice little visit with her when she delivered them. It was a place I would go again and I pray that your blueberry crop does better next year."

The cabin is small (brought to mind our days of travel in our Airstream). We had everything that we needed. Perfect place to wind down. Be advised that the bed is standard size, so if you need something larger, this could be an issue. We plan to visit again during harvest time."

Stayed one night","I was several hours away from home doing some consulting work at a paper mill, and got word that they would need me another (unexpected) day. My reservations from nights before were now booked, and I had nowhere to stay. I found Alma's place on AirBnB and contacted her. This was late in the day, but she helped me out and made it work for me. I got there after dark and left before daylight, so unfortunately I never even got to see the farm. The farm house is awesome though and was perfect for me. I had zero issues with anything. The wall mounted A/C in the room was awesome because it made that perfect fan/compressor combo sound that reminded me of staying with my grandma when I was a kid. Slept like a baby :)"

Stayed a few nights","This is a must see place. If you come in May and June we are told the blueberries are ready to pick. The farm was beautiful, peaceful, full of birds and nature. If you are looking for a place to recharge, this is a must stay place. The cottage was just the right size having everything we needed and then some. The porch swing is where we spent the mornings drinking our coffee and where we spent the evenings just taking it all in. Mrs. Alma and Mr. Jason were awesome and even cooked us breakfast with fresh blueberry muffins. If you're in the area i wouldn't hesitate, just book and enjoy. Just simply amazing."

About an hour from the Trace, quiet, picture perfect and close to places to shop/eat. Alma and Jason made sure we had everything we needed plus more... Although I don't expect to ever be in this area again, if I was I would not hesitate to stay here."

Stayed a few nights","Alma and Jason are the perfect host, and the home is perfect for a romantic, scenic, relaxing and healthy vacation. You will enjoy walking the private path and enjoying the vegetation, or picnicking on the lush grounds.
The property and their private guest house sits on 65 acres of beautiful pastures, trees, and blueberries. On the property there are honeycombs that produce honey.
Breakfast was amazing. The omelette was prepared using fresh eggs from their chickens with homemade jam. The blueberry muffins as you can imagine came from their farm.
If you like farm to table, peace and tranquillity, and nature you will have to book a stay."

If you are looking for a quiet & romantic getaway this is the place! There is a chaise available for a small child but not ideal for a family with more than 1 kiddo. We enjoyed eating dinner on the covered patio & watching the rain storm on the swing. The breakfast was incredible. Can't beat farm fresh food! We were so thankful for a sweet Christian couple to enjoy! Humble, kind, Godly people who are eager to love on others."

The living room area is spacious with comfortable sofas and lounging chairs. Also the residence has a front and back porch or deck that you can sit out on. I would definitely rather stay there over any hotels in that surrounding area.

Stayed with a pet","The peace and solitude this cabin provides is beyond comparison! The photos of the property don’t do it justice. It’s absolutely gorgeous, and they’ve thought of every detail to make it as comfy as possible. The bed and all the furniture is really comfortable, they provide a giant ice maker downstairs, there are multiple options for relaxing outside (2 porch swings, a hammock, a picnic table, a giant deck, a kids swing, a game area, and a fire pit. My favorite part of the property was the screened in giant porch! So relaxing and you don’t have to worry about mosquitos! Our dog had an even better vacation than we did! She loved wading in the water and with no neighbors nearby, she was able to be leash-free a good part of the time (she sticks by us). This was the most truly relaxing vacation I’ve ever taken!! No traffic noise, no hustle and bustle, and no people! Total perfection! We hope to make this a vacation spot several times a year."

Stayed a few nights","Overall loved our stay! We loved being able to use the kayaks and explore down the river. The water was super low so sometimes we had to get out and walk but it was still really cool to see everything that would usually be under water. Only two main cons for us was that we didn’t expect the neighbors to be so close with having plain view of each other and it could’ve been a little cleaner. Mainly just dust, hair, etc. Nothing that would make us not want to come back but would appreciate more attention to small details."

The bed was also very comfortable. The only thing, I was disappointed about, was not being able to enjoy the river but that's Mother Nature. I loved watching the squirrels in the morning and we got to see a deer. We’d definitely recommend it and hope to come back ourselves. Thanks for sharing your beautiful retreat!"

A morning on the screened porch with a cup of coffee was so peaceful. The property felt really secluded, but it didn't take long to get to a store if you needed. We were traveling with a toddler and he loved the place - the outdoor tub was a hit! And we felt really safe wading into the river with him - actually it was kind of ideal - the current was easy, you can just lounge in a camp chair and cool off with your feet in, and he was able to splash around and enjoy the water. We would return in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","The Blue Heron Cabin is magic. Its petite and cozy inside and so spacious and private outside. I loved being able to still be outside on the screened in porch when the bugs came out or the sky opened in a thunderstorm. The outdoor shower was lovely and refreshing. It was great to disconnect from the outside world, and there was so much to fill time with should you need it. A dvd collection that took me way back in the best way possible, lawn games and table games, and a record player with some great records. So many places to nap and read (the hammock was my favorite), write, watercolor, whatever you felt inspired to do. And then there's the river to sit in, swim in, float in, watch flow whatever your heart fancies. I feel so refreshed and filled up after just a few days away. On my next visit I'll remember to bring my water sandals, an inner tube to float on in the river and a few of my favorite records. Book now you wont regret it! Thanks Scott and Alice for hosting me!"

Though our stay was short we spent one entire day exploring up river in the kayaks that were provided and then enjoyed a pleasurable float back down to the cabin.
We also enjoyed having our evening meals on the screened in porch. Though not quite as secluded as we would have hoped it was still an enjoyable adventure and somewhere we would like to return to with our family."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing location, and a great place to escape the city and enjoy nature. The cabin was comfortable and had everything that was needed.
I did have problems the first day/evening due to the neighbors dog. The dog was at the cabin when we arrived, it is the neighbor across the rivers dog. The dog is people friendly (no manners though and jumps on you nonstop) however, it is not dog friendly and attacked my service dog I had with me. To stop a fight I had to put my dog back in the car and wait over an hour for the neighbors to calm their dog back. The dog returned three times the first day/evening and would circle the cabin barking if anyone moved. This meant we were not able to enjoy the river or the grounds at all in our only non-rainy day we were there. For the price it was disappointing.
I understand it’s not the owners fault and out of their control but for being advertised as dog friendly it was not for my stay. I would think twice about bringing a dog."

We were concerned because it was going to be below freezing both nights we were there, but the house stayed cozy and warm! The bedroom is very small but with blackout curtains and hotel-quality comforter and sheets, we got terrific sleep. Can’t wait to visit again when it’s a little warmer for kayaking.

I read a book in the hammock and finished it on the porch.
Also, we arrived in the dark during an intense fog episode. Their directions were clear. And the fact that their gate was painted a beautiful bright red made it easy to see where to turn, even with comprised visibility. The charm and functionality of the red fence is inline with the other aesthetic choices they have made for their lovely property.

Stayed with kids","Overall, this is a lovely property and beautiful location - we had a nice time with our infant daughter on her first trip. The place is well-decorated and very private. I would note that the bedroom is extremely small compared to how it seems in photos (approximately 2 feet of space on one side of the bed, no space on the others) -- we did not expect just how small it was and so we had to have our infant sleep in another room, which was not ideal.
There were a few issues that I raised for the hosts which were not addressed during our stay. The most significant of these was a major bug problem in the kitchen -- throughout the drawers, cabinets, and countertops. We had to throw away a significant amount of food. Unfortunately, the outdoor lights did not work on the porch or on the lower level, which limited our use of those areas in the evening. I raised these issues to the host as they arose via Airbnb message and they said that they would address them for future guests.
After the stay, I received an intimidating phone call from the host in an attempt to take communication off-platform. Ultimately, they provided a partial refund to account for the bug problem."

Stayed a few nights","The Blue Heron is truly a special place. My friends and I went for three nights and we were so relaxed and happy to be there. It's quiet, the river is gorgeous, and the house is adorable and had everything we needed. It is a tiny but mighty house! And Alice and Scott were so responsive to even the tiniest questions. We were sad to leave and will be back."

Stayed with a pet","Blue Heron Cabin is pretty awesome. Tucked away in the woods and about 30 steps from the rivers edge. Our dog loved running and swimming in the water. Rivers pretty shallow right in front of the house. We kayaked (4 kayaks for you to use) upstream a little ways and found some deeper spots. Cabins got pretty much everything you need (ie pots, pans, salt & pepper, gas grill etc). No Wi-Fi and pretty much zero Verizon coverage (AT&T service worked ok). Which was fine. It’s nice to disconnect a bit. Bedroom is tiny and bunk beds are really not comfortable for adults. But the couch is comfy and so was the outdoor furniture on the screened in porch. This place was great and we’d definitely go back. We had 4 adult guests (any more than that and it would be way too crammed)."

The river is steps away, and perfect for exploring. Dogs are welcome, and there are tie- downs available if you worry about having an off leash pooch. Kids will love the large swing, and everyone loves a good rest in the hammock. Lots of options with an outdoor & indoor shower, as well as an outdoor & indoor tub. The water pressure is heavenly! We will certainly return to use the fire pit in the fall. We were sad to leave after our three night stay & are looking forward to returning."

Stayed with a pet","This was a perfect weekend getaway! It was relaxing and it was great to just unwind from everyday life. Cabin is just as pictured inside and out. It was squeaky clean upon arrival and even though it accepts dogs, you would never know a dog was there (granted our dog came with us). Since it was last minute booking I was glad they accepted dogs. I don’t know who had more fun if the dog or the kids. We spent our days outside, the river was low so the kids got to play in it, we used the kayak and fished a little.
The cabin has EVERYTHING you would need. I suggest bringing food/snacks before arriving that way you don’t have to leave the cabin at all. There is no wifi, which we didn’t mind, and one dvd player (bring dvd movies if you have kids).
It fit our family of 4 perfectly. We will definitely come back!"

Stayed with a pet","This is absolutely the perfect getaway spot! Couldn't have asked for a better home base, or nicer hosts. The cabin is close enough to civilization to be able to drive to the grocery store and check out the cute antique shops and boutiques in downtown Summit, but far enough away that you hear nothing but birdsong and the gentle river breeze when you're sitting out on the front porch in the morning. At night there's a lovely dark sky for doing a little stargazing on clear nights. We booked the cabin with the intention of going kayaking on the river and building fires in the firepit each night, but to be honest, the cabin was so cozy that we ended up spending all of our ""at home"" moments relaxing either in the comfy living room or on the gorgeous, breezy screened in porch. There are ample hiking and fishing spots within an hour's drive of the cabin, and we loved adventuring out to Percy E Quin State Park and to the Natchez Trace for some adventuring. The cabin kitchen is so nicely appointed that we abandoned all plans for outdoor grilling and made good use of the cast iron pans indoors on the stove. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's actually a pleasure doing the dishes after dinner in that gorgeous farmhouse sink, too. It was a little too cold to try the outdoor shower or the outdoor tub, but those are two fabulous touches that probably come in super handy during the summer with dirty pups or kids after an awesome day playing out in the yard. There are also plenty of indoor and outdoor games to keep kids or restless adults entertained, too. Alice and Scott have truly thought of everything. We were sad to leave, but hope to be able to come back again soon!"

At night the cabin looked magical with the lights on, like something out of a magazine or movie, photos do not do it justice. There was tons to do, darts, ping pong, cornhole, everything was easy to find. Everything was very convenient, there was a hose right next to the kayaks to spray our feet off & an outdoor shower. Kayaking down the river was my favourite bit, besides a couple houses along the river there was no sign of mankind. And we did see a blue heron!"

They loved swimming in the river and exploring the property! The large decks are great and the hosts did a good job of providing essentials. I do feel the property could use some TLC. The amenities that are advertised left something to be desired. We found cornhole bags but no boards. There were 3 kayaks that were kept upside right so they were full of water and very dirty, and there was only 1 paddle. The dart board and charcoal grill are on their last leg. I love that they had some extras, just wish they were in better shape. Otherwise, we had a wonderful stay!"

Stayed with kids","My daughter and I had a great time here just relaxing and enjoying nature. We would not have seen a single person, except there was work being done on the lot next door. The property is very well kept. The grass was freshly cut. I appreciated the child's life vest and large floaties. We were able to just walk around in the river as it was very shallow. The porch is just amazing to sit outside and relax. I appreciated the cozy mugs and plethora of coffee available!
I was slightly disappointed with the way the games were stored. We had to dig around to find things and there were lots of equipment types of things laying around, like pipes on the ground. We couldn't find the cornhole game in the picture. The full-size bed was very squeaky, lamps were wobbly, and the hammock was coming apart. It didn't ruin the trip or anything- we enjoyed the other swings available. Just a few little updates would make this perfect like the pictures."

Stayed with kids","My family and I came for a few days during my kids’ fall break.
The outside grounds of this cabin are very peaceful and relaxing. We had a very fun time spending time together. However, the cabin could benefit from just a little more TLC. Several pieces of furniture need to be repaired/replaced. The hammock outside was starting to become unwoven in the middle. The bed in the bedroom squeaks every time you move a tiny fraction of your body. I believe this could be fixed easily with a different frame.
Pros: Kayaks are provided by the owners. Also several different floaties for little ones. Linens/blankets and bathing products provided are very nice. Nice river for kids to play it with railing to step down into. Lots and lots of fun games and books are provided.
Cons: Cabin was not as clean as we would have liked. The hot water in the bathroom shower does not get very hot and does not last long enough for more than one person to shower. Bathroom had a strange smell the whole time we were there."

We’ve stayed at several cabins in and around area and by far this is one of our favorites. Everything you need or would want is all in one place and such a quick escape from where we live. Water was lovely, dog friendly, family comfortable and just too darn cute. Property is beautiful and well maintained. Floating on the river was dreamy.
Ice maker is a game changer and so appreciated so you don’t have to haul or run to store. So is the outdoor shower!
Loved the hibachi!
Directions are spot in, easy to find and gravel road is well maintained. Even arriving after dark you wouldn’t have a hard time identifying the fence or address. It’s a hop, skip and a jump to gas/convenience store or to Summit. Town has everything you would need.
Love the options in and around area to explore.
Do not look any further. If you love fun in the sun, splashing in and on the river, relaxing or just unplugging and getting back to nature this is the place."

They kept us up to date on everything and checked in on us while we were there to ensure everything was what was expected. Cell service (Verizon) was not the greatest but we knew prior to leaving that we may not have reception. Only thing the cabin didn’t offer was a tv, as we both need sound to sleep. But a small flatscreen tv and antenna that we had on hand came in perfect. As far as our pup she loved it and the screened in porch was perfect to just sit out for hours. Once we got there we never left! Looking forward for a return trip in a few months"

The cabin itself is really cozy and we love that we can bring our pup with us. Thanks again, Alice & Scott!"

You can tell that a lot of love and thought went into making this space really stand out. We felt right at home and couldn’t stop talking to everyone we encountered while in town about how nice it is. This is a space where you want to come and stay for a while. It is just outside of town allowing you to feel like you are in the country but close enough that a trip to town was not a burden. I highly recommend this country retreat! Stacey is a wonderful hostess and made sure that we had everything we needed!
P.S. Bring tennis shoes so you can enjoy the tennis court!"

The cabin smelled so good when we walked in the first night and as so clean. The cabin was equipped with everything that we needed for our stay.

Stayed a few nights","My sister and I can't say enough nice things about this property. It was beautiful, peaceful, comfortable, and exactly the weekend-in-the-country escape we were looking for. It was an easy drive to the Homochitto Forest, which was quite lovely, and it was an even easier drive to McComb, where we bought groceries and then utilized the well-stocked kitchen's pots, pans, and spices. The owners on property were extremely accommodating and left us on our own except when we needed assistance, and their super friendly cat and dog were a delight. If you have the opportunity, I absolutely recommend staying in this airbnb."

Stayed one night","Where to start! What a lucky find this was for us! We're on a roadtrip from New Orleans and found this beautiful spot to stay for a night. Kendra responded immediately to our last minute booking and proved clear directions and instructions. We arrived and were greeted by the beautiful, friendly Blaze and sweetest little Cookie the kitten! They were the cherry on the top for us at this place!
The cabin far exceeded our expectations. Kendra has thought of everything! Comfy beds, spotlessly clean and so spacious for 4 of us (travelling with adult kids).
We had the best relaxing evening sat on the porch with a glass of wine, reading our books and enjoying the beautiful views and peaceful surroundings.
The only downfall was that we couldn't stay for longer!
Thank you, Kendra and family, for an absolutely beautiful stay. We will be back for longer, on our next visit from the UK."

The water, small sand bar, and small paddle boat was not as pleasing as the photos. It was just a pond and the water was murky and had sand around it. Not something I would want to swim in or even use the paddle boat.
There was a covered area and chairs with a small place for a private fire so that part was nice.
It’s quiet and relaxing at this property!"

The steps outside could use railings and the shower could use a slip resistant mat or something along those lines. My son, DIL, and my 15-month-old grandson staid for about a week and there was no child-proof anyway and no booster seat. But, it was still an enjoyable stay and the host was very nice. I would definitely recommend the place, but people with babies should take along some outlet covers, a booster seat, a wash tub and things along those lines."

Well, your search is over. A winding gravel driveway leads to your slice of rural heaven: an immaculate cabin complete with modern creature comforts: a generous coffee bar, Wi-Fi, Netflix. But we escaped from the modern world. We cooked Sabbath dinner & shared it on the wide back porch. Posed for family photos by the sandy swimming hole. Taught the children to fly kites in the open pasture. Go. And reset your clock to Mississippi Front Porch Time."

Although she does live on the property you have ample privacy, but she's close if you need anything. We would highly recommend staying here to anyone! Such a great property and an even better host!"

If you find yourself in the area and want a peaceful and relaxing place to base your SW Mississippi itinerary from... this is a perfect option. Comfortable roomy cabin, well appointed and quiet. Beautiful grounds, trees, deck lights. Rained a good amount the week I stayed and the rain on the tin roof was fun. A friendly outside dog to come say hello when you come and go each day. Good place and good value."

We felt so comfortable and well cared for at her cabin as she continued to check on us after we evacuated from Louisiana due to the hurricane. Ms Kendra provided us with a beautiful spotless and tranquil place to stay and made us feel like old friends. She adds all the extra touches and goes above and beyond to show that she cares for those who stay at her home. We highly recommend her as a hostess and an incredibly kind person. Our sincere thanks !

We thoroughly enjoyed the space. From the super comfortable bed to the little touches in the kitchen (like every spice you could need), they anticipated and provided everything you could think of. (Including a dynamite DVD collection!)
The property was quiet, easy to find, and the pond was a perfect retreat on a hot day.
We were desperate for an oasis and so lucky we found such a beautiful place hosted by such friendly people. We can not wait to return!"

I drove down from Chicago to visit my daughter. We were able to sit and enjoy the peace and quiet of the porch, we baked cookies, watched a movie, and felt completely comfortable in the cabin. If I had a question, she responded instantly. The cabin is spotless and full of everything you’ll need! She left snacks and bottled water and information for fun things to do in the area. There was plenty of parking for both our trucks. We had every amenity we could have hoped for. Kendra and Kendal have done a wonderful job of making a sweet place to stay for your “home away from home!” You won’t regret a trip to this cabin! Go enjoy yourself...they make it a perfect spot to stay!"

For the winter, there is central heat and a space heater in the living room. The bed is very comfortable, and the linens are crisp! The bathroom is spacious and has a shower with great water pressure. There’s also a washer and dryer that are very handy. The location is just secluded enough and is really quiet and peaceful. There is a small pond with a swing hung by it you can enjoy in the sunshine.
All in all, this cabin has all the right touches for comfort and relaxation. After just one day, it feels like “home!” I will absolutely be back and already cherish my time on Firefly Lane."

Stayed a few nights","1905 Cabin was everything we hoped for & more! It was a tree-house retreat. Beautiful surroundings, wide open spaces to hike, private & included just the right balance of being off the grid that we were looking for. The outdoor shower & jetted bath tub were some of our favorite amenities. The grounds are so well-cared for. The time & love that this family puts into their property can be see in all the little details. Stone Hedge was a super cool feature! The views from the back deck over the bottom were breathtaking-taking! There’s charm at every turn.
We hiked, visited the chicken coop, found different places to watch the sunset, picnicked, grilled & enjoyed bubble baths under the stars. We were very fortunate to meet one of the owners & learn some of the farm’s story. There are so many details that you will discover as you explore. Follow all of Ainsley’s instructions about what to bring & you will have the most amazing experience! We will be returning very soon!"

Communication with the hosts is superb. The digital guidebook provided answers to every question you have about to your whole visit from check in to check out.
The cabin is very livable- good furniture and bed, spaces for every need: functional kitchen, dining space, relaxing space, work space, and very comfortable bed. The outdoor space is even better; they’ve created so many amenities: huge multi-level deck with lots of seating, a jetted tub, an outdoor shower, a fire pit…something to use and enjoy in any season.
We started planning our next visit within the first hour of arriving. Great spot, great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect get away!!!! Very intimate and a good space for two people. It’s does sleep more, but we visited during the warmer months and the up stairs loft has no AC and was too hot for anyone to sleep.
There were a lot of spiders on the outside of the Cabin and surrounding area to include the the windows, so we couldn’t open the windows if we wanted. But that’s to be expected in the woods.
The grounds are AMAZING. So beautiful and the deck is great. There’s places to do any outside fire and to spend a lot of time outdoors. The speakers in the house were one of our favorite adds. You can listen to music through the whole cabin. Loved it! We will definitely be back."

Collecting fresh eggs for my breakfast was especially nice and if you enjoy foraging, you'll find many different kinds of mushrooms and berries. The house is very cozy, spacious, and plenty of seating inside and outside. A rocking chair would be the only thing I'd add to this AirBnB."

We ended up leaving early our last night due to the power going out. Staying in a pitch black cabin that’s over 100 years old was not my type of fun. 👻. Other then that the stay was very nice!

Stayed a few nights","This rustic farmhouse took us back in time and was a neat way to celebrate my husband’s 75th birthday. We spent several days relaxing on the deck and the porch, swinging in the hammock and enjoying the trees and birds and deer. We walked the property and soaked in the outdoor spa tub, explored Percy Quin State Park and bought milk and cheesecake at Mauthe’s Progress Milk Barn. One day we drove over to the Lynard Skynard Memorial and were amazed by the number of young people stopping by who weren’t even born when the band’s plane crashed. We dipped our toes in the Bogue Chitto and ate catfish and shrimp at Stogner’s. Ainsley was very quick to respond when we had questions, self check-in was easy, check-out instructions were clear. The place was clean and quiet, with no neighbors in sight, whimsically decorated—-a real country getaway."

After a little while of letting the air in and letting the AC run, the house was a very comfortable temperature. The grounds were perfectly green, stonehedge was very well maintained, the trails through the woods were well worn and easily navigable. It’s the PERFECT place for a weekend getaway outside of city life, if you need a reminder of how beautiful nature can be. Very thankful for this trip, will absolutely be visiting again!"

Stayed with a pet","Fantastic area to get away and cozy farmhouse to relax in! The reviews and description are exactly right on. This place was perfect.
My husband, son, and two pups stayed four nights. Our goal was to RELAX and this far exceeded our goals. Felt secluded and private~ just enough. But also basic amenities are within a short drive. We cooked all our meals here, and the kitchen is great. Wifi and phone service (Verizon) worked fine, not always super fast but enough and just as described in the listing. The TV was kinda slow, but perfect for my son at night before bed. You can sign in to your Netflix, etc. And we honestly wanted to be disconnected so none of these were concerns for us.
Take the time to visit Mauthe's Dairy, the cheesecake and chocolate milk were very memorable for my husband's birthday. Delicious!
We visited at a very hot time, so we kept our hikes short, but the little amount we did were very enjoyable. Loved visiting the chicken coop and the tree nursery is very cool to hike around! We hope to visit again at a time when it's less than 100 degrees so we can spend more time exploring outdoors and doing campfires. Beautiful landscape and scenery all around the cabin and farm. We were able to stay very cool hanging out in the awesome outdoor bathtub~we wore swimsuits and there were bubbles available, it made for a very fun way for the family to keep cool on a record breaking hot day. The back deck is amazing! We grilled and enjoyed the hammock and there are many seating options for coffee/drinks/hanging out in the shade. The front porch is so quaint, and very cozy during a thunderstorm. Although we never got to use the firepit, we really enjoyed moon & stargazing from the seating there. I'm sure I'm leaving something else great out, but everyone enjoyed our stay here very much, dogs too!"

The deck is really amazing and the property was fun to explore. We mostly hung around the house and deck, chatting and reading under the high tree canopy. At sunset, we fired up the grill and opened a couple bottles of wine. The location is pretty isolated, so plan your meals ahead and bring what you'll need to prepare them. The peace and quiet are worth the effort."

Stayed a few nights","The Fortenberry Farm experience is absolutely breathtaking! My husband and I stayed in the 1905 Cabin for a honeymoon weekend getaway and never wanted to leave. Outside we would just stand there listening to the sound of the breeze moving through the meadows, song birds, echoes of farm animals and the crackling of our fire. We felt like we had jumped into a Beatrix Potter novel. We didn’t see any other visitors and we explored the whole farm so it felt like we had the place to ourselves. Ainsley and her family were very attentive to our questions and we couldn’t critique a single detail. Wifi and reception worked perfectly, we even got to watch Netflix on the tv. There is a speaker system that you can hook your phone up to and play music throughout the house and deck. At night we soaked in the hot tub on the deck and there were fireflies everywhere. I could go on and on but in summation it’s magical and we will be returning ASAP!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I were only able to get away Thanksgiving week this year so we wanted somewhere private and secluded. Just somewhere to get out in the wilderness and disconnect from society for a few days. Ainsley’s place was exactly what we were looking for. Plenty of space to walk and explore, an outdoor fire pit and indoor fireplace, as well as a beautiful outdoor deck area to just hang out and BBQ or relax in the hot tub. There are plenty of dead sticks and tinder to pick from the property to make your own fires without having to haul a bunch of firewood. My wife enjoyed the deck hammock overlooking the garden Stonehenge and was able to read a large portion of her 800 page novel. One thing to consider going in - since this is a rural area - the internet is not the greatest - not that my wife and I were complaining. If you have children, you may want to bring some movies to watch on the Blu-Ray player. Sunset for us was about 5pm so we entertained ourselves by playing cards and reading and relaxing by the indoor fire. There are a selection of novels and board games to choose from as well. All and all, just a very peaceful, quiet vacation which was much needed.
PS - bring your flashlights. At night, I was able to spot several deer on the property!"

Stayed a few nights","This rustic cabin is located on beautiful property. The outside has a relaxing deck with a nice hot tub which is clean & comfortable. The back deck is a perfect spot to enjoy a cup of morning coffee.
The cabin is decorated in a variety of rustic, island, steam punk, & vintage decor. The kitchen has a coffee pot, pots, pans but I suggest cleaning them before. There is a microwave, stove & refrigerator that is clean & new. Bring your own food, coffee, condiments & even bottled water as none are provided. The bathroom has a wonderful shower but bring your own toiletries including a blow dryer. (None was provided even though it was stated.). The downstairs bedroom has a queen bed & two single beds are upstairs. They are in fair condition but clean.
There were several house rules & a list of check out request I felt were annoying & unnecessary. Read the list before you book. The night before check out I was sent a list of request that I needed to do before I left such as strip the beds & take out the trash, wash dishes, clean the bbq pit, throw the ashes in the woods, etc. Of course I clean up after myself but if I'm stripping beds & taking out trash, what is the $88 cleaning fee for? We were there 2 nights so there wasn't much to clean. It was difficult to relax when I was given a list of request that had to be done, as well as a reminder to leave on time.
I was sent an update & charged $96 when I left after letting her know a head of time we would have an additional guest. Be sure you know, 2 guest is the price quoted in the ad & $50 more for each additional guest per night. Cameras are mounted outside & checked to verify number of guest."

Stayed a few nights",We stayed at the 1905 cabin for a getaway birthday trip for my boyfriend. We live in Wisconsin so it was a bit of a drive but when we stepped foot in the cabin we were awe struck by the lovely decorations and atmosphere. We spent many hours exploring the area but we also spent a lot of time on the deck enjoying the hot tub and views. The cabin had everything we needed to enjoy our stay with extra amenities. The house manual really helped guide us with our stay since we are not familiar with the area. Overall it is an amazing getaway with beautiful charm from the fast paced life the cities offer. We will definitely be staying again!

The lack of connectivity didn't detract from our stay at all. The cabin is cozy and we brought games and art supplies to pass the time. When we got a small break in the weather, we took advantage of the trails on the property. The walk was really beautiful. The goats and chickens were a really nice encounter.

Stayed a few nights","The cabin and property are amazing! I cannot express just how wonderful of a stay we had, and pictures are not able to show the true splendor of the place. The cabin is lovelier and roomier than I imagined. A few things are as rustic and basic as I had expected, but the artwork and rugs and special touches all over the place make for such an incredible vibe. The property, with all the plants and trees and hills, is absolutely stunning. We went on several hikes, covering different areas and seeing new things each time. We stayed 6 nights and only left twice. Once to go to McComb for groceries and to get takeout from Wilson BBQ & Soulfood Express (HIGHLY recommend), and once to spend the afternoon at Red Bluff (also HIGHLY recommend). We each borrowed a walking stick from the porch, and they really came in cutch for the more difficult parts of the descent and climb. The loft, with its comfy futon couch and front facing windows, is a remarkably nice spot to enjoy in the afternoon. There was an abundance of easily collectible and dry firewood on the ground, and the fireplace in the dining room and the firepit outside were set up with everything else. There were even a couple of nice rocking camping-type folding chairs in the bedroom closet that we thankfully used around the fire pit. And the hot tub! Not only is it very nice and clean and large, its place out on the deck in total privacy makes for a surreal experience at night. Winter was a perfect time to stay at 1905 Cabin, but I look forward to going back in the Spring to see if it the grounds can possibly be any more beautiful. My partner and I are the always-prepared type, and it served us well as always. I recommend bringing a hatchet or small ax for firewood and a utility lighter, extra towels, easy slip-on shoes for walks out on the porch and deck, and full-size mugs if one drinks coffee. We did not use the grill, but there were several left-behind bags of charcoal. I can’t believe I almost passed on renting the place because of the double bed. It was a little firmer than my preference, but coziness of it actually really suited the romantic nature of the place."

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED staying here and wished we'd stayed longer. The cabin was so cute and just secluded enough. The views were amazing and my boyfriend couldn't stay out of the hot tub. Ainsley and her team were incredibly attentive, offering quick responses whenever I sent any messages. The cabin its-self was very well decorated and cozy, even with the colder weather outside. The kitchen was beautiful and had everything we needed for meals. We especially loved using the fireplace which we were able to run using sticks and fallen branches we found around the property. The only thing to consider, and i'm sure this is stated in the listing, is that the largest bed is a double size which can be uncomfortable but not enough that I wouldn't stay here again. Ainsley's place is a great getaway from NOLA and we will definitely be back if she'll have us!"

Stayed a few nights","The pictures don't do this place justice. It is just the coolest - chock full of folk art, rustic beauty, and unique reclaimed pieces. Perfect spot to surprise my husband with a relaxing birthday weekend getaway. You can chill in the hammock, soak in the hot tub, or explore the grounds -- the rope swing is not to be missed!
Tips for fellow travelers: Bring coffee. Also booze, if you plan to imbibe: Nearby Tylertown appears to dry, so there's no picking up a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Be sure also to pack an extra pair of flip-flops or other slip-on footwear. The hosts don't allow shoes inside, which is fine, but we found that we were constantly fetching shoes back and forth from the front porch to the back deck. Trust me, you will appreciate having some simple footwear you can just keep by the back door to slip on and off as you come in and out from the deck (which is itself one of this property's best features). The host provides fuzzy slippers, which is a nice touch, but I didn't want to wear them outside.
All in all, this was a wonderful experience. We loved our stay at the 1905 Cabin so much that we already have plans to return every year -- or whenever we feel the need to get away from it all and recharge our batteries."

The back deck and hot tub were our favorite place to relax, as well as the hammock. We will certainly book this space again in the future!"

But the real star here is the property itself. The cabin, rope swing, and Stonehedge are really charming, and we saw a lot of deer on our exploration of the property. And the back deck is incredible for grilling out, relaxing in the hot tub, or just some early morning reading. Hope to be back soon!"

The entire place is designed with love and creativity. I can't wait to come back. Side Note: The first night the power went around around the whole area (NOT the fault of the hosts) but unfortunately there were no working flash lights (all the batteries were dead) or candles and they were not able to bring any to me. That was quite the adventure! However - the rest of the stay was perfect and lovely. Highly Recommended!"

It has all off the home necessities that anyone would need such as kitchen essentials and this made out stay even that much more comfortable. We cooked our favorite meals, took hikes on the property, swung on the giant tree swing and reset ourselves during this retreat. I’m so thankful for this experience and hope to return.

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at the 1905 Cabin! More than anything, we appreciated the remoteness of the location—while easily accessible from New Orleans, the actual cabin is far enough removed from other people that there are no curtains on the windows (except the blackout ones in the bedroom, which helped us sleep in). It was a bit drafty inside until we figured out the gas heater, but the hosts were responsive and the temperature wasn’t an issue after that. If you’re planning to cook in the kitchen, you may want to bring your own seasonings, dish towels, and paper plates, as those amenities were a bit spare, but the brand-new appliances were great!"

We it was mere friends thats enjoyed this beauty, but one thing thats certain is we absolytely loved it, and provided we are fortunate enough we shall return!
I have been back in Nola near 3 years and haven't found tgat special place to do spiritual retreats, but this is it! Alone time with Fod and his wonders can be found at the 1905 Cabin.

Stayed a few nights","This cottage is completely charming in every way! From the scent of gardenias blooming by the porch steps to the delightful vintage fixtures throughout, we felt enchanted by the house. The owner's have lovingly restored the building adding modern conveniences while retaining all of the architectural details of a 100 year old house. Their fantastic primitive art collection adds considerably to the interior ambiance. If you put the co-ordinates given into your GPS, you will be directed right to the entrance. The house seems completely isolated from any outside noise. You are sharing the space with only the small wildlife of the area, and two friendly neighboring dogs who playfully make the rounds in the morning. The only disappointment was that the 2nd bedroom, with twin beds, was located in an un-airconditioned attic bedroom. This will likely not be an issue for any guests staying in cool weather, but it was too warm for us to use during late May."

Stayed a few nights","I was at the 1905 cabin this past weekend to celebrate my 30th birthday with two of my best friends. We needed a low-key place to catch up and relax, but feel like we were still on a vacation. This place was beyond perfect, stocked with anything we could have needed, and everything we had questions about were answered almost immediately. The weather got really severe (we now know there was a confirmed tornado in the location) and the power went out, but the hosts met us with a bag full of emergency supplies and even offered to let us stay at their home if we needed to. We ended up staying at the cabin and riding it out, but we still had one of the best weekends! I highly recommend this cabin to anyone looking for a getaway of any kind. I don't doubt that we will be back in the future."

Being able to wake up in the morning and just sit outside and watch the cows grazing was just... peaceful. The inside of the house was clean and spacious, considering its a one-bedroom house. All appliances are new or at least appear to be. My favorite part of the house was the built-in sound system though... especially after I finally figured out how to connect it to my phone to play music. If I ever need a place to stay in that area again, I'll definitely try to book there."

Loved the wrap around porch overlooking a field of cows and wooded area. What i was most impressed with was the cleanliness of the place and comfort of the king size bed. I also loved that there were no synthetic fragrances, plugins, scented candles or anything like that. Its a perfect place for anyone with a chemical sensitivity or just sensitive to smells.
The host is quick to respond and very helpful."

Thomas is a good host and the stay in his pool house as well as the area was pretty nice. If you're attending an event at Oak Hill Estate like we were it's only 17 mins from the venue. I would reccomend his place if you're looking for a nice stay in the area for you and your family.

Stayed with kids","Thomas was responsive, kind, & accomodating (e.g. blowup mattress requested). My husband also shared that Thomas appeared nice & respectful over the phone when he talked to him the night of our expected check-in. However, the home did not meet my family's expectations in-person. We had a flight delay & my husband attempted to check-in at night while the kids & I were still visiting family. He did not feel it was a safe location for our Black family, as the beauty of the pool and lakeside view from the pics were not seen as he drove towards the home. Perhaps it is hidden behind the trees. Unfortunately, the area was very eerie, dark, and forest-like. & the landscape (trees, bushes, grass) appeared unkept where there was also a wrecker-truck near the home which didn't help with the asthetics. This home was not viewed in the daytime nor the inside of the home. We decided it was safer for our family, which included an infant and 6-yr old, to inconveniently spend the extra costs for a Hotel"

It is in the middle of nowhere, which for me was so wonderful. The creek was beautiful, the porches were perfect for sitting. Everything was just great.
If you have Xfinity Phone service it will not work out here. This is not a place to come and do work or school work. The Wi-Fi does well in keeping the tv going if you want it going, but it is not a strong connection for much else in my opinion.
This was not a problem for me. I actually enjoyed being disconnected.

Stayed a few nights","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the cabin! My partner and I enjoyed the seclusion and the fact that we only had to leave for groceries. The farm was beautiful and we were able to go to the chicken coop for our breakfast eggs. I will say, however, my issues only happened once we left. I put my partner in charge of leaving the keys in the lock box (probably a mistake) but he assured me he did. Instead, he left them in the door which was something we did not realize until after our check out. Payment was attempted to be collected for lost keys and small glass found in the garbage disposal. I know we did not break anything or use the garbage disposal, so I had asked them to adjust the request and I would be happy to pay for a cleaning fee for my pup we brought. I had spoken with the host prior to arrival saying I was bringing a dog and we agreed on a $100 fee, but I was not going to pay for lost keys ($25) and a broken jar ($25). I received no response and I assume a bad review."

I live near Chicago so I'm not used to the country life anymore so this brought it back, we stayed 4 nights and it's what I needed to bring me back to my roots, I'm from Louisiana and miss home a lot. The electricity went out and I panicked, I thought I did something, the host told me it happens in the country often. But, she was very responsive & it was only off for like 20 mins.

A hot tub on a screened in front porch, games that bring families together in the barn next door and a creek within walking distance. Oh and the man made fire pit area was great for s’mores. My family and I needed to disconnect and reconnect and it definitely helped us do that! We will be returning for a longer stay. Thank you Ainsley."

The cleanliness was over the top. ( thank you for that detail). It was so relaxing. Husband and I enjoyed the creek, porches and game room, which was a great bonus. It was like staying home away from home, we did not do without. Amenities were perfect. We enjoyed cooking, hiking, relaxing and watching TV. It was so nice to do absolutely nothing and not feel guilty about it. We left the cabin clean like we found it both inside and out. We will definitely be back more than once a year. It is now our go to place for relaxing. The cleanliness of the cabin is worth mentioning again- we were very very very pleased with that.
Thank you so much for such a nice place!!

All of the people in charge of the property were super responsive to any needs or concerns and very kind!
As someone who cleans airbnbs I was impressed with the cleanliness. It has that just cleaned smell when you walk in. The beds are comfortable! The art is beautiful to look at. Ideal for a painter or writer looking to get some things done.
I will definitely be coming again."

This peaceful secluded cabin was just what we needed, the beautiful surroundings, sounds of nature, relaxing hot tub,little to no cell service!!! It was amazing, the laughter, the conversations this place brought to me and my wife sharing our anniversary of 11 years was truly one for the books. I will most definitely recommend this place to anyone trying to just reconnect, we have already shared this location with family and friends. Get out of the busy city and out in the real country. Ainsley does a wonderful job of explaining this location and what to expect… just a extra note fill the hot tube about an hour before you are ready to relax , lol it provided a good two hour laugh and conversation for me and the wife . Me being ready to jump in excited as can be to site in the tub for an hour waiting for it to fill!!! Haha we had a blast! A must stay !!"

There’s not much to do around in town unless you drive a ways down, but I believe it is well worth it. Me and my husband loved this getaway and didn’t want to leave.

Ainsley and crew are fantastic to work with. Quickly respond if needed for anything. We really have nothing negative to say other than it rained daily so we chose not to explore the property.
If you want peace and quiet, stargazing and lots of nature you need to plan this Airbnb into your travels.

We have an 8 month Cane Corso and a 6 year old Frenchie - we appreciate the accommodations - just make sure you have that pet fee added before paying
Our dogs loved it lots to explore without seeing anyone!! Everyone in town was friendly
The drive was beautiful
My husband and I had a blast 💥 in the game room and he learned I was a professional ping pong player !! Yes that right!!
We would stay there again and book longer !!
I don’t want to say book it because I want it ( but secretly between you and me… it’s a diamond 💎)"

Stayed a few nights","This is a GREAT place to stay. It is close to both Tylertown and McComb, and just down the street from Paradise Ranch- but when you are relaxing on the porch it is like you are a million miles from civilization. Inside has all the amenities one could want with internet, TV, beautiful decor, washer/dryer access, a fully functional kitchen, two bedrooms and two baths. The beautiful little creek is perfect for wading and rock hunting. The property is landscaped with plants native to Mississippi, and you can enjoy them all from the comfort of the breezy front porch - or screened in porch - or back patio - or side deck... a full 360 of outdoor views! There is a grill for outdoor cooking, a porch swing, and a large recreation area in the barn area out back that includes seating, corn hole boards, and other yard games. There is even a firepit with rustic seating for those chilly evenings."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I are expecting our 1st babygirl in about 3 weeks so we searched for a close relaxing get away and found Love Creek Cabin. It was the perfect babymoon. We enjoyed the day sitting at the creek with our dogs (they had a blast), evenings sitting in the covered porch, movie nights and more fun in the game barn! It truly was one of the most relaxing trips we have taken, just what we needed!
10/10!"

The house feels so homey, and the decorations are pretty stinkin' cute. It rained most of the time I was out there, but the screened in patio came in clutch. Would recommend. 10 out of 10 Ronald McDonald's."

With Ainsley's approval, we brought our dog who loved to play in the creek right nearby the house! The house was very comfortable, and we spent most of our time in the screened in porch enjoying being outdoors. Would certainly recommend!"

We plan to return for our next weekend getaway. Would highly recommend!

Despite the fact that we were there in freezing temperatures and grey skies, the charm and natural beauty of this place was still quite obvious! The owner went above and beyond to help us when our power went out due to the ice storm, assisting us to another of her cabins, which was a wonderful display of local folk art. We had such a nice time, even during the extreme weather, that we have already rebooked for a week in April! Love this place and the folks who run it."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was really great! We were looking for something close by and was secluded. We brought groceries, bicycles, and books. The best part was the multiple porches. Most meals were eaten outside. We walked through the woods around the property our first day then used the grill. Next day, we went to the dairy farm nearby for homemade cheesecake (so good!) then for a bike ride. The roads are quite hilly and challenging, but it was a nice and scenic ride. The closest liquor/grocery store was over 20 minutes away so I was thankful we came prepared. Our last day, we hiked, used the firepit for a campfire and star gazed. The space was clean and charming. Loved the pink dishes. Also enjoyed ping-pong. I hope to return some day soon!"

We were so drawn to the creek that we never got to enjoy the trails. The property was beautiful, quiet, and peaceful. We admired the hummingbirds, a pair of hawks, an armadillo (named Andy), Gus the lizard and his numerous girlfriends as well as various tracks along the creek . The game barn was a cool place to hang out as was the screened in porch. It was a much needed restorative trip. The host helped make my Mother's Day all the more wonderful!"
