Whitney was very responsive and provided lots of helpful information."

The chicken theme throughout made us smile and was very well done!"

Stayed one night","We had a really nice stay here. Comfortable bed, very clean, easy entrance. Super cute chicken theme. I wish we could give 4.5 stars instead of whole numbers: the hot water ran out pretty quickly for our showers, and the pillows were quite flat (which I suppose some folks might love but we found pretty uncomfy). Something for tall folks to note: the shower ceiling is pretty short, someone over 5’9” would probably struggle a bit."

It was in very close proximity to all of the must see places that Colorado Springs/ manitou springs has to offer! Whitney was super clear in her directions on how to find the property and her recommendations for places to eat were great! We tried several of her recommendations and were not once disappointed. Such a great little place in the heart of CO springs. Thank you, Whitney!"

Parking was handy and Safeway is just a one-minute drive away. I went up to write and hike and it was a good little spot for that. Good heat (it snowed while I was there). Good hot water. Nice shower. Good wi-fi let me work and stream whatever I wanted. The only quirk was a somewhat low bathroom ceiling (I am 5'11"" tall) but it was workable. An overall a good choice for the mission I was on!"

Stayed a few nights","I love Whitney’s place the most of all my trip (14 days with 5 Airbnb stays)! Chicken Coop is very cool and clean and cozy property with just everything you need for your stay. Plus, Whitney must be an artist because she decorated her place very nice and decorative. Parking is also super convenient with a private parking right in front of the cottage. A big yard with table and chairs for morning coffee and sunset relaxation is a real value.
The location is also great, close to some best sightseeings in Colorado Springs (Garden of the Gods, Manitou Springs) with quite and beautiful neighborhoods.
One more plus is Whitney and her husband are super helpful and responsive. They’re quick to fix things when needed and provided lots of useful guides for dining, sightseeings, etc.
I would 100% recommend you all to book this place when visiting Colorado Springs for I’ll surely book again if we come back. Thanks Whitney for hosting us!"

I absolutely fell in love with the chicken coop. From the location, private entrance, decor, amenities, and quick response from the host. (I had a small operator error initially).
They had the best reading nook with books and post cards. The bathroom was amazing and had access to bath products and other accessories. I feel as if a lot of thought and love went into the chicken coop. Even the coffee cups were cute and fun! I would definitely request a repeat stay if I ever get the chance to return to Colorado.

The location is a big plus, you're a short drive from Garden of the Gods and a convenient distance away from Manitou Springs + Pike's Peak. We were only there for a couple of days but Whitney's place allowed us to seize the day and check off some of the destinations on our bucket list.
Most importantly, we came back ""home"" to a beautiful/relaxing place. Will book again for sure."

My favorite feature had to be the little reading nook. I took a bit of time to read through ""Weird Colorado"" and plan out other stops for our trip.

Whitney was full of excellent suggestions about local activities and food, and gave very clear instructions about how to get to the house. We asked for some extra items beyond what would be expected, and Whitney was still quick to oblige. We’ll definitely recommend the place to friends and hopefully be back ourselves. Do note that if you have a long vehicle, you’ll probably need to park on the side street. Our CR-V + hitch mount bike rack was a challenge to get in & out of the little alley parking spot (but we always did it!)."

Stayed a few nights","Brian and Whitney’s Chicken Coop was an extremely nice and quaint stay. Our first day arriving, we got to meet Brian and he was very nice welcoming us to the Coop as he was finishing up a couple of things! We also had unexpected visitors on the other side of the fence, some deer! Very relaxing and peaceful to sit outside in the mornings on the adirondack chairs with coffee in hand. So many stores and restaurants in the area that are 100% walkable! We did have an issue with the ceiling fan and Keurig being a little dirty but Whitney did send someone at the earliest convenience possible and went above and beyond to make it right! She is great at communicating and gives very fast responses! Only issue I had that isn’t their fault, it’s that I am 6ft tall and I just needed to duck under the restroom doorframe to get in as well as for the shower, but it did not take away from the experience! Highly recommend this stay if available!"

Stayed a few nights","The Chicken Coop was a great time. Bit tricky to find since it’s hidden in the alley, but once you find it you’ll never forget how to get back. The parking space was a nice perk. So close to Manitou Springs and Pike’s Peak. Had so much fun there. Highly recommend this place for a couple’s get away. Whitney was very good at communicating with us and recommended some great places to eat nearby."

Stayed one night","Property was just as the listing said. It was cute and quaint. Note that as the listing describes, the parking is tight and the bathroom is small. There is also NOT a TV. We missed seeing that as not being an amenity. During my shower, the hot water went out after about 10 minutes, but heated up quickly for my husband to take a hot shower. I'm assuming its a small water heater. It was very clean and decorated very cute and the essentials for a short stay. It was comfortable and served our purpose for a one night stay. Communication was excellent."

Stayed one night","The Colorado Rockies are incredible to visit and view, especially from a quaint, homey place like the iconic Chicken Coop--a tiny house that boasts more room than one might assume. a spacious main room with kitchenette, and a fun corner nook for card playing or eating breakfast. The bathroom is a little tight for those of us over 6-ft tall, but workable. And Whitney was super helpful with A TON of local tips and info for our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Overall really enjoyed our stay, the place was clean and the bed was comfortable. I'm not sure if this is mentioned anywhere but the only thing I would bring up is that the tallest point in the bathroom is about 6'5 inches and slopes down to about 5'6 inches to the other side. I am tall at 6'4 so the bathroom and shower was less than ideal. I could manage but I did have to duck the entire time I was in the bathroom. If you are not over 6 feet tall this should not be an issue. Thankfully everything else was great and the location was right in the middle of pretty much everything you would want to do in Colorado Springs."

The parking is a little tight (I have a full size truck), but not hard to get in to the spot. It is right next to the entrance. Very private. The place was very clean when we got there, and there were some little touches that make your stay memorable. It is super close to the places we wanted to go, and still not far at all from other things we found to do. Overall, it is a great place to stay, and great hosts. Whitney is great at giving you instructions on how to get in, also she sent a lot of recommendations on good places to eat, and things to do."

Stayed one night","Me and my daughter made a quick stop at ""the coop"" on our way to Breck. We LOVED it! it was so quaint but at the same time so homey and had everything we needed for a nights stay. It was very clean and smelled fresh. We loved the postcards! The bed is really soft, which my daughter loved, im more of a firm girl but we both slept great! The shower gets good and hot but the water pressure is a little soft, so ladies just go a lite on the condition :) The area outdoors was really nice as well! We were so close to main street where you could eat and shop all day! We even got to see wildlife! The only warning i would give is about the parking, its tight!...if u drive a full size truck or something in comparison, i was able to get into area provided but it was a job, Whitney did offer other parking but wanted truck close and honestly it was the neighbors horse trailer across the street that made it difficult to get in&out of spot. Over all we loved and would definitely stay again!"

Had some trouble getting in the front door when we first arrived (apparently needed a separate front door code, which was accidentally not sent) and once our apt code stopped working. BUT - hosts have a 24 hour response and they immediately got back to us, so we didn't need to wait.
Would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","When I first got there the place looked great at first sight. As I was scoping the place, I noticed the throw blanket did not smell clean, the stove was stained, & the restroom had an odd smell - enough to have to keep the window open. The restroom seemed fine, until the smell wouldn’t fade, the toilet felt wobbly, & the shower spilled water unless the shower curtain was tucked in, which only made it that much smaller and slippery. There is no curtain on balcony door, which allows others to look straight into the airbnb. The heater did not work. I had so much trouble keeping it on. I even put it on 80F to see if it would turn on & still no luck. It snowed while I stayed there, so this was not appreciated. Having to use a 3rd party to get the check in felt so unnecessary because why, after having to pay so much money, should I have to verify my identity. Other than that, location is GREAT, parking was always available, & lots of nice restaurants around."

Stayed a few nights","Although very close to downtown COS and walkable to restaurants, our stay was unpleasant. I was never sent the check-in instructions and had to call customer support once we arrived in COS and be transferred to an associate who was finally able to ""check us in"". The heater in the house did not work our entire stay. We walked into a very cold house and the heater clicked all night and eventually turned on ONCE but quick working again. The house did not have any extra blankets - only the sheets/comforter on the one bed - so we had to bundle up with extra clothes to stay warm for two nights. The bathroom tub was dirty and full of hair. Pots and pans were dirty with old food. The outlets in the entry way, bathroom, and upstairs bedroom near the bed did not work. The neighbors were incredibly loud and got into a fight around midnight our second night there. They were screaming, slamming internal and external doors, and moving furniture around for multiple hours in the middle of the night."

Stayed a few nights","Exactly like the pictures and reviews even down to the low ceiling you may hit your head or shoulder on. It’s a cute small place however the window in the door to the balcony needs a curtain as does the window across from the bed. Even though it’s on the second floor you can still see through the unit. Neighborhood is quiet and very close to restaurants. Abandoned house was kinda creepy. The level the bed is on doesn’t cool down well even with the ac on so if you’re a hot sleeper you will definitely notice it, if not there is two fans provided.
The bad….
Initial checkin was seamless and the unit looked exactly like the pictures however upon inspection of the bathroom, the tub had a balled up towel with pubic hairs and was still wet. There was also mens soap and dirty foot prints and more pubes inside the tub. It clearly wasnt cleaned and someone had just used it. I messaged Hoste around 630pm when we checked in and he apologized for the issue and said he would inform the right people however he offered only the apology and no solutions or compensation. After the dirty tub the integrity of the entire apartment was at question because how is the only tub in this small unit missed ? Once we advised him we were uncomfortable with the tub he advised he would reimburse us for any cleaning supplies we would have gotten to clean his tub. He would have even had the cleaners drop off supplies incase we didn’t want to buy them. I politely asked him to have the cleaners clean the tub then since they were going to drop off the cleaning supplies. He said ok and advised they could come after 330pm. Our stay was only 2night 3 days."

It was perfect for two people, although I would not recommend it if you are taller than 5’6 as the loft ceiling with the bed in it is about 5’5 and must be physically able to walk up a VERY narrow spiral staircase, it is not the easiest. Easy check in and access, the laundry is located in the basement of the building, not in the portion we were staying in. But overall, a wonderful Airbnb."

Stayed one night","Beautiful building in a great location; however, we ran into a few issues regarding cleanliness of the unit and a hostile couch that crumbled beneath us when my wife and I sat on it upon arrival. I will say, HOSTE was quick to rectify our troubles and refund us. Of note, the stove eyes were not cleaned and the fans stored in the closet were packed with dust. Understanding it is Colorado, so weather is generally comfortable, the loft remained quite hot as the A/C did not circulate properly in this area of the unit. For this reason, we attempted to make use of the fans provided, but these were packed with dust which coated the loft when we turned them on. The stairs to the loft are also quite narrow, so keep this in mind when booking if you chance to be over 150 lbs. Additionally, there were no blinds on the patio door, so anyone from the street could peer into the main living area (thus privacy was a concern considering the centrality of the unit to downtown). Altogether, the unit is artistically designed, but much work needs to be done for this to be a top-notch stay for any traveller."

I only got refunded the cleaning fee of 75.00$ couldn't use the tub or the living space, the owner is diffinitely greedy and lacks any communication over any of theses matters. I've never written a bad review before because usually when I spend decent money for what looks like a decent place I get a decent if not awesome experience... this one was a bust sorry phillip fire your hr rep."

This space has great potential with a little more effort by the cleaning crew. Be advised that the loft bedroom is not easy to navigate.

The kitchen is well stocked with pots,pans, plates, bowls, and utensils! We made several meals and never had an issue with the kitchen not having something we needed.
The only thing I would say is this is not a good place someone who is uncomfortable with small stairs. The spiral stairs going up to the loft are cute but are kind of scary to walk on because they are thin and very steep.
Overall we loved our stay and would recommend it!"

Stayed about a week",location is great and the room was clean but there where some faults. The shower curtain barely covers the shower so it's hard to not get water out of the tub. The stairs are pretty tight and it shakes and moves as you go up and down it. Also the couch is sunk in and is kinda uncomfortable and small. Other then that the rest of the place was very nice and pleasant. the location itself is worth the stay.

Stayed a few nights","Having stayed at Philips place before, I was looking forward to it! I’m sure it was just a hiccup but the initial listing and the listing after you booked rules change for whatever reason. Before paying it states you can smoke outside as long as your 10ft away from the door or window. After I paid it changed to you’re unable to smoke at all. I messaged Philip to see what’s going on and was told that I’m not able to at all but I felt a little misled. On top of that, there was a couple dirty towels on the entertainment system but I’m sure that’s an outlier as I’ve stayed with Philip before and the cleaning was immaculate the first time."

Stayed a few nights",Let’s start off by saying the home was beautiful an had a great style throughout. It was equipped with all the necessities as for things you might of forgotten which was nice. The location was great due to garden of the gods being not even 10 minutes away and in a very quiet neighborhood. I will say that although the style was good I wish the house would have been cleaner. I do appreciate that the host let us check in earlier and we landed earlier but the vent elation system wasn’t cleaned and that was dust accumulated within time. Our allergies acted up due to that and only in the house. Some outlets worked others didn’t. Overall the cleanliness just seemed not up to part or what I had expected I should say because that’s why a cleaning fee is charged right? I feel like overall everyone is right about the stairs being DANGEROUS. Every step seemed like either it needed tightening on the screws or like it was about to just give in. Overall I think the location is nice. The house was beautiful but I’d probably stay in a hotel if ever in Colorado Springs due to the expections on cleanliness and health safety.

Stayed a few nights","As others have said, sleeping up in the loft got pretty warm; the a/c is below the loft, so even with a fan going full blast upstairs, I got too warm to sleep several times. The shower leaves a lot to be desired; technically, yes, I got showered, but the showerhead is short and the shower curtain pole really needs to be much bigger/wider than the tub... it's impossible to take a shower without standing on the curtain, and without the shower curtain clinging to you from all sides. The listing claimed ""mountain views,"" but the only way to see the mountains was to be on the patio, and get a tiny glimpse of the top of one in between the trees next door. This is really a super cute place, so it's kind of a shame that it's overall pretty inconvenient. The spiral stairs are a bit frightening in the middle of the night, and if carrying anything at all. Again, really cute place, but needs some definite improvements."

Stayed a few nights","Great location. Very central. Loved proximity to downtown restaurants and mountain biking in Red Rock, Garden of Gods, Cheyenne Mountain State Park. I was traveling with my son and it suited our needs well. I gave 4/5 for cleanliness because the shower curtain hadn't been washed for a while. It's one of those lovely clawfoot bathtub/showers but they had shower curtains going around the tub on the outside and first time I showered water dripped down and got the whole bathroom floor wet. I pulled the shower curtain into the tub to avoid this but realized it was quite dirty and pulling the shower curtains in, there was a higher likelihood of them touching me. Also, I could deal with not having a dishwasher, but there was no dish rack either. I had to put utensils, bowls, dishes into a plastic bin to drip dry and later did some cloth drying before putting them away. Yes, the upstairs loft can be quite warm when it gets 80+ even with AC on, but once the sun goes down cool circulating air from open windows plus the fan upstairs makes it tolerable. All in all we did enjoy our stay."

Stayed a few nights","This apartment was much smaller than expected. The loft bed area was not tall enough to stand up straight and there was very little room on either side of of the bed. I actually broke my foot the 2nd day from kicking the bottom corner of the bed, so I couldn’t even hike on our hiking vacation. Now I get to wear a boot for 2 months. There is no place to change in the bedroom and no counter space in the bathroom. The stairs are tiny so if you need to go in the middle of the night, it’s treacherous to say the least. The owners were good communicators, but we would have preferred a simple hotel room to this tiny apartment. We would definitely not go back."

Stayed a few nights","This house worked fine for what we needed, but it was tight even for 2 people. The couch bed needs to be replaced. I wouldn’t rent this if you or anyone else has mobility issues - seniors, kiddos, or otherwise - the “stairway” to the loft was super narrow & impossible to walk up or down in the dark. This is a great home base, but not a place you should plan to relax/hang out in. Hosts were lovely and super responsive & we felt very safe. Never heard any neighbor or road noise, either. Best nearby restaurant we found was Dos Santos. Don’t bother at Shugas - they don’t seem to want to serve out of towners ;). Central location was great."

We mostly ate out; however, in the early morning it was nice to have a cup of tea or coffee with a warm danish. The bed was firm and very comfortable and, although we did not need it, it was nice to notice that it was all handicapped accessible. The cottage is located in the heart of the historic North End district and there is a beautiful 1929 Episcopal church just behind the cottage. Everything is within walking distance.

The space between the main house and the Airbnb cottage forms a private parking courtyard. Your car is visible from the room. It feels secure and peaceful.
The room was spotless and showed great attention to details that make for a comfortable stay: wifi, coffee, snacks, coat hangers, luggage stands, comfortable bed, plenty of towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash. Everything was there. Everything worked.

Stayed a few nights","I appreciated the details at the Camden suite. Everything was great! Very clean and if you are someone that needs shower rails or a a small stool to sit during while you shower, this is the place for you.
Also, if you are forget like me for shampoo, conditioner, and soap, make up remover wipes, if you need some water, but forgot to bring some with you, or plates for your leftovers, Tina has them.
Tina's thoughtfulness really helps you feel at home.
I loved the Camden suite so much! I definitely want to come back :)"

Check-in was a breeze, the place was comfortable and close to everything: Good food, entertainment, hiking, etc.! The unit boasted of beautiful natural light and one of my favorite parts was the warm bath robes to snuggle into after the shower. Tina supplied snacks, water, coffee, and provided top notch toiletries. We would definitely stay here again!"

The Camden felt luxurious - we were enamored with the attention to detail, from the light fixtures to the bathroom amenities, to the coffee nook with everything we needed to make simple meals.
Tina and Josh were exceptional in their communication, and were wonderfully helpful when we forgot our phone charging cable. A fantastic place to stay! We hope to come back again!"

The Camden Suite is cute and well-arranged with many practical touches that are helpful and useful while staying there. The many windows afford the opportunity for much natural light during the day, but there are also blinds and curtains for privacy and to completely block out light at night. The bed has one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on. The location near downtown is just perfect for accessing all parts of CO Springs, and the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. The locking mechanism for the suite is secure and easy to use. It was also very helpful to use the available off-street parking space for my rental car; the size is best for small to mid-size vehicles. Tina is very responsive to any needs or questions. I look forward to staying here again on a return trip in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","There is not a better place to stay in Colorado Springs with everything you want. The location is a very short walk to downtown located just a block or two from Colorado College in a historic district. The spot is surrounded by other historic homes, churches, and small businesses. You can easily make your way to hip and cool restaurants, shops, and bars in a few minutes. Moreover, you are less than a 30 minute drive to any of the surrounding tourist attractions. It's very centrally located
The visible amenities are amazing. It's lovely space with a large dining room table, a spacious bed, a large bathroom, and lots of antique furniture. The windows come with both translucent blinds and shades to give you both privacy and whatever amount of light you need. Moreover, it feels very open and comfortable. There is also a massive television on the wall if you want to sit back and relax in front of the TV.
What truly takes this location to the next level are the hidden extra features and excellent details. The Internet is very fast and worked wonderfully for the work we needed to accomplish. There are also abundant power outlets and more than enough spots to plug-in all your devices. The room also had dishes, coffee, a microwave, fridge with freezer, snacks, water, and every other little item to make your visit perfect. Returning every evening to our reserved parking spot was a wonderful convenience. I also loved that the doors had a code for entry, making it convenient and simple to leave and return.
The location itself is very serene and quiet. While the front location of the main home is on a very busy street, you actually slip down a back alley to get to the cottage and parking. There are other guest rooms nearby but we never heard them other than a friendly greeting in passing. We never felt crowded or disturbed. The alley itself has no traffic and sits behind a very beautiful church. It's not only quite private, it feels very safe.
Overall, the cottage is really a perfect location with amazing amenities in a beautiful setting. This would absolutely be our first choice if we return to Colorado Springs. It was easy, comfortable, and exactly everything you want when traveling."

Great location. Walking distance to downtown. It’s safe and the nearby streets are nice for walking.
The owner is very responsive. Easy checking in and out.
Only thing to keep in mind when booking is the thermostat is preset because it’s shared with adjoining cottage.
Will definitely be back!"

Stayed about a week","This place was lovely! The location was perfect for my stay and the space comfortably accommodated myself and my partner. Tina was super helpful and responsive to my messages.
I have only one criticism that is more of a personal discovery so not something to hold against the hosts. I just thought I would share it as a heads up.
The listing clearly states that the thermostat is shared with the connected unit (duplex) so that the host controls the thermostat. I didn't have any issues with having the temp increased. Tina always responded quickly to my requests. With that said, it could be a bit inconvenient for me at times. For example, if I didn't return until late in the evening I wasn't comfortable messaging on a weekday at 11pm to ask about the thermostat. So I would wait until the next day. (The heating blanket was awesome though!)
If that doesn't bother you, then definitely book this unit! I enjoyed my week-long stay."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I can’t express enough how both our host, Tina, and her Camden Cottage Suite is like a dream!
The cottage is cozy, spotlessly clean, and beautiful in every direction and is reflective of how an amazing and warm person Tina is.
Tina was very understanding, patient, and accommodating to all our questions and requests which was very much appreciated as we got caught in the middle of Hurricane Sally and had to make a few modifications to our travel plans which made all the difference and was helpful in our trip being a success. We give Tina and her family our heartfelt thanks!
Tina’s level of care and thoughtfulness is apparent throughout the home from the comfortable bedding, a very thorough local information guidebook that she personally made, and ensuring a pleasantly well-stocked cottage with items and many amenities that aren’t typically offered at many BnBs which made our stay absolutely lovely and restful.
Our stay at the Camden Cottage Suite was the highlight of our trip. We felt so welcomed and comfortable. We will definitely book and highly recommend staying at The Camden Cottage Suite when visiting Colorado Springs!"

LOTS of light from numerous windows, all with easy pull blinds. . Host provided a large notebook with thorough instructions for everything from the locks to the TV remotes. Also a TON of info on what to do in Colorado Springs. Even a walking map to downtown. Extras included extra towels, plenty of soaps, shampoos, & lotions, Keurig with an assortment of coffees, a wide variety of teas, a variety of sweeteners & sugar, creamers and waters in the fridge, to go cups & covers, iron & board, even an electric blanket (my wife loved that). Dorm size microwave & fridge/freezer. Wi-fi had good signal. Extra large flat-screen on the wall included Apple TV. Bed was firm but comfortable, as was the bedding & numerous pillows. Location was easy to access, in the alley behind a big house a few blocks N of downtown. Communication was great. EVERY note I sent was returned within an hour. Tina even emailed me to warn me of a parade downtown Saturday and told me which way to get around it. We not only would stay here again, we ARE staying here again in 3 weeks when we are back in Colorado Springs. One more thing to note. There were power strips on both sides of the bed, and by the big dining room table, so plenty of places to charge."

My only drawback was receiving a $7 charge for getting makeup on the white washcloths. Tina provides a black makeup washcloth, but as someone with sensitive skin, I can’t risk using a black washcloth that may be hiding stains, etc. (I wash the same makeup out of my white washcloths at home- would never have intentionally ruined hers.) Wasn't so much of an issue- just wanted anyone else with sensitive skin to be aware!
If this won’t be an issue for you then definitely stay at Tina’s!"

Beautifully furnished, comfortable bed, plenty of wall outlets, mini fridge/freezer, microwave, and Keurig with everything you need. She has Apple TV and a big TV in the room. We had no issues setting up our Netflix and Hulu accounts on it. Tina left an awesome Welcome binder in our room with a ton of great ideas. The cottage is maybe 20 minutes from Manitou Springs and Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. Only an hour south of Denver. We had an excellent stay and would definitely stay again if we come back to Colorado Springs! (Side note: she keeps the room at 73 degrees, and provides a small fan and a heating blanket. We like our house cold, but we had no issues! We turned the fan on and sometimes opened the windows and it was perfect 👌🏻)"

Sure makes a difference when you book an Airbnb to feel more like home. I'm not handicapped but I noticed this place is set up for ADA accessibility. They've gone the extra mile to make this comfortable for those in need from the ramp to the handles in the shower. I should note, the weekend we were there it was unseasonably hot and the house is temperature controlled. It was warmer than we wanted to be comfortable but the windows that surround the house would create a great breeze throughout the room in cooler temps. Overall, great place."

Got to talk to Debra for a little bit, and she was incredibly welcoming and gave us great recommendations. Also this is probably one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in, I won't even lie.

It was beautiful and comfortable and felt like a little home on wheels. I went when it snowed and the views were awesome with the snow on the ground, like a winter wonderland. I’ll have to come again when it’s warmer and enjoy the campfire next time!!! I would highly recommend staying here, Debbie and Terry were very accommodating and helpful, they are good people and I enjoyed speaking with them during my time there!!

Stayed with a pet","My partner, pup, and I adored this little RV! We live in Colorado but were looking for a little weekend getaway. Black Forest is simply charming. And stunning. And Debra and Terry’s property is amazing. We walked our pup each morning, explored the acres behind the RV, and enjoyed seeing the projects they have going on. Debra and Terry were INCREDIBLY kind and accommodating. I appreciated that they gave us recommendations when we asked and wanted to hear about our day, but also gave us space to enjoy the getaway. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

The camper is about 20 minutes from most things in Colorado Springs.
This is a great place for a couple or maybe 3 but keep in mind the camper is small and cozy. Most nights are cool and you can just open the windows, but there is air-conditioning.
I highly recommend this place if you just want a quiet getaway to reconnect with yourself and nature."

Stayed with kids","this was a really cute camper van, a bit smaller than expected but is very cozy and has so many furnishings! we were here for a day and were able to explore some parts of the black forest. we were pleasantly surprised by some of the thoughtful touches (s'mores, goat petting, etc!)
the only big problem we had was with the heating. the heating doesn't reach all the way to the bed area even at the highest setting, and it turned off in the middle of the night and it was freezing in the van. during the morning, the bed remained at a medium temperature between the heater and the outdoor temp, which was too cold to hang out. since our heads are right by the windows which don't do much for heat retention, we woke up with a head cold after the evening. we were under all the blankets but it still got super cold, so I would not recommend staying after the night temp drops below freezing!"

Stayed with kids","Debra and Terry’s property is a gem of a glamping escape just outside of Colorado Springs. It was just the right size for me and my 8 year old granddaughter.
The vintage trailer is so charming and decorated beautifully inside and out.
The well-apportioned kitchen has all the amenities for a quick meal. The fridge is just the right size to hold drinks, eggs or leftovers from a day exploring the town. A small table inside is the perfect size for a dinner for two.
There is a small toilet inside the trailer and a large shared bathroom, with tub and shower, just inside the main house, which is several yards down the path from the trailer.
The bed is very comfortable and the space is sparkling clean.
Debra and Terry provide a portable fire pit for s’mores or enjoying an evening outside under the stars.
The property is huge with lots of space for walks and visits with the resident goats and sheep. There are also a few great hiking trails just up the road.
Exploring Colorado Springs is convenient. The trailer is 30 minutes drive to Manitou Springs, Garden of the Gods, Pike’s Peak Railroad or Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.
After a day exploring, this cute trailer was a perfect respite in the quiet forest.
I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Debra and Terry are on-call if you need a fan or to borrow a bike or want to chat. Unfortunately, they were also there sometimes when I really needed some personal space. Note that the trailer is situated right next to the homeowners house and garage, so that there is no private outdoor area anywhere around the trailer. Inside the trailer is cute and the bed is comfy. Hopefully the ac will be working for you if you need it. I hope you have the option to use curtains/shades/blinds on every single window by the time you stay there. Please ask Debra if you can play with the adorable puppies outside if the weather is nice :)"

Debra and Terry were so kind and gracious. Their property is gorgeous! (Go walk it all!) their animals were so fun and the drive to all the sights (which Debra has thoughtfully bindered all together) was perfect! We could go and explore the mountains and cities/towns and then come back to cozy comfort. Buy some groceries and cook on the stove or in the crockpot and enjoy camping 1965 style. Sit by a bonfire and look at the stars through the incredible trees. Go pet the goats/sheep (and maybe even some puppies if you’re lucky!) Children are welcome here and will have a blast!

The accommodations in the home (where the bathroom and shower area are located) were quite surprisingly cluttered and smelled of fresh litters of puppies. Not to say it's a bad thing, but important to note if you're allergic to animals. The hosts were very kind and accommodating to my requests, and also very understanding when I had to leave early due to some personal emergencies. Wishing you all the best, and can't wait to have a vintage trailer of my own! They are so cute!"

The sheep and goats were a fun thing to watch for our son. They have 7 acres of land to explore. We had a very nice crockpot dinner thanks to the amenities in the camper! After a great time explorin the Manitou caves and Garden of the Gods which was a 40min drive, we had a very restful, cozy and comfortable sleep.

Being that it is an older duplex, don't be surprised by squeaky floors or doors that don't quite shut. Also, being downtown and across from the police center, you'll occasionally hear sirens and trains going by. We used this home as our base to go hiking nearby at the Garden of the Gods and Seven Falls which worked out well."

Anytime we simply just needed a little assistance - she was responsive quickly, EVERY time.
(We loved the back yard too!)
The amenities were so advanced and up to date.
Loved the shower and the choice of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Smelled really good, not cheap feeling.
My wife is trying to find something that smells like the products used in the store as we speak (lol)!
The choice of seasonings and cooking utensils/dishes/coffee/teas were great! You can even grill if you'd like!
We really enjoyed our time and missed the place on the way out the door (lol)!
Kaitlyn is a professional and efficient host; and my family and I appreciate her and the entire team.

The house is a perfect place to come back to after a day of adventuring. We cannot say enough great things about this house, the hosts, and the experience. We will 1000% be coming back!!!"

Absolutely spotless and very tastefully decorated, felt open and airy, even with its smaller size. Just a note, the bathroom is very cute, but also very compact, if you are a larger person, it would be challenging. We loved it and would come back if ever in the area again!"

Stayed with a pet","We had a lovely, relaxing weekend at The Little House at RRCOS! Check in was easy with the keypad and they were extremely responsive anytime we messaged. Unfortunately, the weather put a damper on our plans, but fortunately the Little House was the perfect place to cozy up for a weekend and watch the snow fall on the absolutely beautiful view from their backyard. The location is super easy to get to, and really convenient to get to Downtown Colorado Springs or Old Colorado City. One thing to note is that the bathroom is very small. While Josh and Wendy do note that in their listing, the pictures didn’t quite do it justice for me. If you are a large person or have mobility issues, it may not be the right house for you, as there is very little room to maneuver and using the toilet might be a challenge. Otherwise, I would highly recommend if you are looking for a great place outside Colorado Springs, there is no way you would find a more peaceful spot!"

We grilled steaks our final night, and sat by the fireplace our final night and it was just unbelievable. We even saw some mule deer later in the night which was awesome. The living room was cozy with the indoor fireplace. The house was extremely clean and updated. I would recommend this airbnb to friends and family any day of the week. Thank you Josh and Wendy."

Stayed about a week","Our stay at the Red Rocks Open Space Little House was perfect! The house is cozy, very clean, and artfully decorated. If you’re not an outdoorsy person, you can view the red rocks and mountains from the living and dining areas. For us, the deck was the place to be! Amazing views of the red rocks and surrounding mountains, the ever changing weather, and so many birds! You hear them and see them often. Two of our favorites were the black-billed magpie and the Bullock’s oriole. Both stunning birds that we don’t have at our home on the east coast. In the evening, the fire table adds a magical element to moon and star gazing.
The house is located in a quiet neighborhood off Hwy 24. You can hear traffic noise but it’s not super loud. We visited over Memorial Day so there were many more cars on the road. The Little House is minutes from quaint and eccentric Manitou Springs and minutes from Garden of the Gods and so many other CO Springs destinations.
Josh & Wendy are terrific. Many stars!"

It’s a great location—It’s so conveniently located in the middle of everything CO Springs has to offer for tourists. The place was clean, sleeping areas comfortable.

The interior was clean, thoughtfully decorated, and exactly what I needed. They were so accommodating with my needs for an iron and ironing board. They went out of their way to purchase one for me to use.
What can I say? Absolutely lovely people and memorable stay. I highly recommend Josh and Wendy’s little house and I plan on being back soon.

The hosts were very thoughtful & even left a personalized card and sparkling cider since we were celebrating our anniversary. We would definitely stay here again!!

The only issue was the master bedroom air was broken so we did have to open the window some to cool the room down.

All fresh and clean (sparkling clean!) amenities: huge comfy bed, large bathroom with deluxe shower and tub, and spacious, comfy living room. (The pictures do not do it justice.)

We hiked, explored, and returned to a well stocked kitchen to cook our meals. We watched football on the cozy couch with the fireplace warming us up. The bathroom? Gracious, that bathroom.

It was private & woody enough to satisfy the cabin feel but only twenty minutes from food & fun. The fully equipped kitchen would have easily been perfect had we decided to stay in. All of the amenities were considered from toothbrushes, sanitary napkins and hygiene items like soap & shampoo to even an umbrella & shovel. We played games & lounged fireside watching Netflix on the couch. It truly was an amazing, peaceful weekend."

There's a soaking tub, heated floors, patio with heater, ceiling fans for relaxation. The kitchen comes with a lot of necessities for most meals! A lot of natural light throughout the day and no city light during the night so you'll see a bunch of stars. Although the cabin is on a lot with surrounding cabins, we still felt some sort of peace and privacy as the other guests were quiet and hardly seen. If you decide to go into town there are well known stores within 15 minutes."

Everything you need is within 15-20 mins of driving distance so you are still in the peacful atmosphere of nature. The house was immaculate, and I must say the heated floors was the best thing they could have done to this cabin, it was such an appreciated thing when it was down to 4 degrees one night. If you get to be around when it anows it was like a wonderland. The deer that roam the property are so relaxed and beautiful and seem to be there everyday. And if you get the chance to, you have to ask the story of this beautiful property, it's truly an amazing piece of history. We will be back for another one of Debras BNB's."

Stayed one night",Exceeded expectations!!! One of favorite Airbnbs that we stayed at. Great location- about 20 minutes from the Academy! The claw foot tub was a highlight. We wish we could have stayed longer.

Stayed one night","My girlfriend and I were blown away by Debra's place. The modern interior was gorgeous (especially the gorgeous bathroom!) and the outdoorsy exterior gave a great cozy and homey feel. Would 100% recommend, everything is as advertised and then some! Oh and I didn't even mention the bluetooth speaker built-in to the shower :)"

Stayed about a week","We loved staying here! My husband & I traveled here for our honeymoon, and it was in the middle of almost everything! We really enjoyed being able to travel everywhere , but also relax if need be. These women have created the perfect little getaway! This little home allows you to rest and relax, but also have fun by traveling to nearby big cities!"

Stayed one night","Literally everything about this place was perfect. I’ve never stayed in a more perfect air bnb— secluded from the town, but not far at all!! This made for the best trip. Debra was wonderful at communicating and things were just so simple! 10/10 will be staying here next time!!!"
