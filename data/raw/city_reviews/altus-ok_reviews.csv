The property is absolutely beautiful and serene. Robert and Jeri are such wonderful hosts, always quick to respond to any questions we had. Robert even took us on a tour of the property with his precious pup, Sophie, where we learned the history of the land. The cabin was private, well kept and had anything you could possible need for your stay. We would love to come back in the future!"

Cabin was very clean and had everything we needed. Beautiful, peaceful location. Lots of deer and heard wild turkeys, but couldn't see them. Great for star gazing!
Robert took me on a tour of the property and gave a little history. Very interesting."

Stayed with a pet","Our son wanted to go to Oklahoma for his birthday. We decided to go to the mountains and we were not disappointed. Robert and his wife, Jeri, were amazing. We arrived late but Robert took his time to talk with us and give us recommendations for places to eat and visit the next day. He gave us the most amazing tour of the property. My husband and I are archaeologists. Robert allowed us to completely geek out. It was his birthday and he still spent several hours with us telling us the history of his family and the area.
The accommodations were just as promised. It was so peaceful and quiet. There are so many things to do in the area that even with 3 days we couldn't do it all. Everyone we met was just so nice and hospitable. It was one of the friendliest places we've ever been.
We visited on Easter weekend and were able to have an Easter Egg hunt on the property of the cabin. It was such an amazing time spending it together and meeting new people. We can't wait to go back!"

Robert and d his wife are great hosts and we love being able to stay at the cabin and take advantage of the hiking and trails on the beautiful property. The location is also very close to the state park so plenty more to explore of Quartz Mountain area. The cabin is cozy and has everything needed. We will be back again!

It's tucked away from the few tourists who come to Altus, dead silent at night, the lake is within walking distance, hiking is encouraged on the property, and it's cheaper than most places surprisingly. Robert and his wife are quiet and lovely people as well!"

The area is beautiful and we always enjoy cooking breakfast and hiking the property, then coming back to the cabin for a nice dinner in the cozy cabin. This is definitely one of the places to stay if you enjoy a peaceful, scenic getaway plus a lot of history with the property to boot."

Stayed a few nights","This place was absolutely amazing! It was the perfect place and weekend for my husband and I to just get away from our busy lives and the hustle and bustle of the city. We hiked and climbed and took in everything around us. It was so nice to just unplug in such a breathtakingly beautiful place. I think we saw close to 20 deer as well while we were there. Robert was also such an amazing host. He took us on a tour of his property sharing all the rich history of his family and the land there. His hospitality made the trip more of an experience over just a trip, if that makes sense. Even recommended where to go for lunch in town that did not disappoint. Best chicken salad sandwiches ever! Such a great weekend all the way around! We loved every second of our time there and plan to come back each year for our anniversary."

We were given a tour of the property and my little girls loved every bit of it. We hiked and fished near by our cabin which was an absolute blast! The view of the stars was also a highlight of our trip. The Quartz state park is just a stones throw down the road and also offer hiking trails and scenic views. I highly recommend staying at this cozy little cabin off the beaten path! We will definitely be coming back in the near future.

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is “our” spot to go for a romantic, peaceful retreat to get away from everything and everyone located in beautiful surroundings that refresh and renew our spirits each time we go. We always get out and drive around the mountains and sometimes visit the nearby lake or the pond on the property. We are nature lovers. The rustic feel of the cabin only intensifies the effects. Robert is the best host bar none, and any particular kitchen item that I have requested, he has delivered quickly. This time, we had an awesome new mattress to sleep on!! The best Airbnb hosts and getaway experience ever in our books.

If anything is needed during any of our visits, all we did was message him and within minutes, we were supplied with the item. During our last visit, our truck became stuck due to heavy rains and Robert was there to help without being asked for help. I call that good old-fashioned courtesy and being an attentive host. We highly recommend Robert & the cabin if you are looking for a peaceful getaway situated in beautiful surroundings."

We didn't get to enjoy the fire pit because of the rain but the place is so0o cozy we just relaxed and enjoyed the rain while looking at the gorgeous quartz/granite-made mountain. Robert gave us a tour on our first day and learned a lot about the place. We loved waking up to a beautiful mountain and green scenery. The place is just a few minutes from Quartz Mountain State Park. We had everything we needed especially in the kitchen from plates to silverware and cooking utensils. We will definitely come back sometime.

Stayed a few nights",Roberts cabin exceeded our expectations. We were hesitant about such a remote location but the remoteness was the real value. Robert was there when we arrived and took us on a tour of the property and provided fascinating history. We had a great relaxing vacation biking and walking on his property. My daughter and her boyfriend fished and explored to their hearts content. The cabin is small but perfect for our tastes. It was clean and well furnished. Robert provided excellent service picking up the garbage and asking if we needed anything. We look forward to another stay there.

It’s not far from Quartz Mountain Park, the lake, and gorgeous mountain scenery. The cabin was bigger than it appears in the photos, and although the kitchen space is a little on the small side, I managed to cook just about anything we wanted. The grill was fantastic, and were the hosts. Very responsive & extremely helpful. A very memorable visit."

We very much enjoyed the tour Robert gave us of the property the first evening with lots of history provided. We enjoyed walking the trail for fishing at one of several ponds on the property and caught/released so many fish (catfish, blue gill, bass). We were within minutes of Quartz Mountain State Park as well where you could also fish with a fishing license at the lake. The property is beautiful with several sightings of wildlife including deer, armadillo, lizards, turkey, a raccoon. Robert was an amazing host and very accommodating. We hope to return in the future for more fun."

It was a nice weekend get away from the city. Quiet and peaceful, we also got to see some deers and hear some coyotes at night time to enhance our cabin experience"

My family had plenty of private sleeping and bath spaces, with a large table for eating together. Great wi-fi when I needed it, but found myself outdoors most of the time as it was just beautiful and walkable. I especially appreciated the way the closets were labeled. I didn't have to search for anything, and with a really well-equipped kitchen, I won't bring as much the next time. There was plenty of room for two dog crates, and a doggie box with towels and old sheets for easy clean-up and furniture protection. The location is dusty, so those simple additions made it so easy to manage my dogs from outside to inside. They were in ""doggie heaven"" the whole time. Thanks for a great stay in beautiful SW Oklahoma. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","As many others have said this place is pretty remote but that is exactly what we were looking for. It's a great place to be able to spend the day hiking/exploring the Wichita Wildlife Refuge, which is just about a 10-15 minute drive away, then come back to relax in peace and quiet. Just be sure to bring food and snacks with you, the kitchen will have just about anything you need to prepare a meal. It also was refreshing to stay somewhere that the host seemed to have a genuine interest in making you feel at home! I've stayed many places lately that you can tell the property owner has numerous locations or is a very large company and you have no idea who you're actually communicating with. Not the case here; the owners are local and not far away, they're very responsive! The space actually feels bigger inside than it looks outside, it was very comfortable! We visit this area often and I will definitely be keeping this location on my list as a favorite for a launching point!"

Stayed with a pet","Clarkhaus is a clean, cozy and peaceful place to spend a few days out in wide open spaces. From the front porch there is a beautiful view of the Wichita mountains which are just a short drive from the house.
The house is very clean and well stocked with all of the necessities one might need while away from home. The beds are so comfy. The hosts make sure there are plenty of towels, sheets, bedding (they even have optional electric heating blankets in each bedroom). There are extras like books, games, toys, along with maps and field guides to the wildlife and nature of the area. Our group of 6 adults and two dogs fit perfectly in the house and enjoyed driving over to explore and hike in the nearby mountains. Thank you, Chris and Claire for a wonderful experience. This was our family’s second time to stay there, but hopefully not the last!"

We cooked all our meals in the house, and the kitchen was functional, with a full set of cooking supplies. It is a short and scenic ride into the wildlife refuge.
The hosts were quick to respond and provided clear and concise directions. It is obvious that this is a beloved property. We felt grateful for the opportunity to stay at such a unique and special house."

Stayed with a pet","Clarkhaus was a little dream holiday for us! Previous reviews speak to its loveliness but it was even better than I anticipated. My partner, pup, and I truly enjoyed our time here. Although we wish we could’ve stayed longer, 3-4 days is an ideal amount to explore!
My favorite Airbnbs are ones of genuine hospitality, people-to-people connection, and experiencing a little slice of someone else’s life! Chris & Claire’s place is all of that! It’s a real home on land full of history, decorated with local art, and so much evidence of hard work and love put in. Shelly was very warm and welcoming and responsive! She made us feel cared for from the start. The house was so well-maintained, clean, with everything you could need! We brought enough food for the duration and cooked each day. After hikes in the mornings, we read in the rocking chairs or on the porch. In the evenings, it was sunsets and shooting stars (we saw many!)
The Wichita Mountains are close and the Refuge was amazing for hikes and views (loved Elk Mountain trail!). We saw Bison, elk, river otters, road runners, collared lizards! We also recommend Great Plains State Park nearby (you can swim in the lake aka Tom Steed reservoir) and the kid-friendly, interactive Museum of the Great Plains (in Lawton) for other activities. There was a whole prairie dog town outside the parking lot!
Our city dog, Gussie, enjoyed being safely off-leash, hearing the coyotes yip and howl and chasing grasshoppers. We didn’t encounter any snakes but she did find a scorpion and tarantula (nothing harmful or to be afraid of - wildlife is cool!) We just made sure to keep an eye on where she stuck her nose! We were grateful she could come along and hike with us, too. There weren’t many people because of heat wave restrictions but that ended up being nice, honestly!
We can’t wait to return! If you love nature, being away from hurried life, and feeling sweet solitude, here’s the place. Thank y’all!"

But when I woke up a short while later, both my adult dogs were asleep on top of the bed too, and even the puppy was snoring away in her kennel. I just wish we could have had more time to spend here.

Stayed with kids","We hadn’t done an Air BnB before and had heard horror stories of some experiences, of course, but Clarkhaus’ owners and property blew those fears out of the water - absolutely 5 stars all around. It was our 12th anniversary and we celebrated with our two kids and our pup, Molly. Shelly, Chris and Claire have the property set up so it was not only perfect for my husband and I but for our kids and dog. My youngest had toys galore to play with and my oldest had Netflix and board games. Molly was super comfortable and loved exploring outside (though she also slept a lot because we took her on a lot of hikes lol).
Super close to the Refuge, by the way - perfect for hiking and exploring.
Thanks y’all! You are so amazing!"

Hands-down, this is the cleanest, most comfortable, most well-appointed rental we have visited. The hosts have thought of everything. The house is a LONG ways from a store, but is outfitted so well that we've never had to make the trip. The Wichita Mountains are a beautiful area for hikes or picnics, and while we enjoy strolling around Medicine Part, we really love coming ""home"" to sit on the bench and watch the sunset. The scenery and the solitude are incredible, the kitchen has all the pots, pans and appliances you need, and the beds are supremely comfortable. We'll be back!"

Stayed over a week","The Clarkhaus brought comfortable living in a very dynamic country setting. Its not often I get to see stars on the horizon as bright as the ones above, but out here they all shined.
Working out of town was the reason for our stay, and instead of a cramped hotel room for a couple weeks I searched for a nice house to crash at, and man did I hit the jackpot! House is in spectacular shape! Very welcoming, easy to get to and easy to enjoy. Even getting snowed in for a couple days wasn't so bad since it was so easy to feel at home!
The hosts were above and beyond helpful as we had to get into town quickly and figure out how long we needed to stay. I reserved the first couple nights to get an idea of how long the work would be, then our hosts bent over backwards to accommodate. I really cannot say thank you enough. I look forward to staying again if I'm ever in this neck of the woods again."

Stayed with kids","Stop what your doing and just go book this place, seriously. The pictures don’t even do it justice. We actually booked another night after we were already there because I just could not get enough of this house and the views.
When we were looking at places to stay near the refuge, everything in Medicine park was right on top of each other, and nothing seemed to offer the vibe you really want when you come to the wilderness. Then I stumbled across Clarkhaus. It is situated on the opposite side of the refuge from Medicine Park and offers the private solitude that we were seeking. You have no neighbors. Just you as wilderness and an amazing view. The sunrises and sunsets are nothing short of amazing.
It is only a short 20 min drive to the refuge which made it even more ideal.
You do need to come prepared because closest stores are basically in Lawton which is a good 45mins.
The house itself has been updated and is decorated beautifully. There was even a spare single bed mattress in the closest that we used for extra sleep space for our girls that didn’t want to share a bed. The house is also well stocked on mostly everything. Laundry soap, dish soap, seasonings, ziplocks, tinfoil. Also tons of maps and literature on the history of the mountains and the refuge.
Wildlife around the house- it’s there. You are right smack in the middle of nowhere. In the 3 days we stayed we saw lizards, spiders, snakes, a box turtle, a extremely large toad(we named him Thomas, I’m pretty sure he lives in the flowers by the front porch), a cat, cows, a coyote right by the house, hundreds of flying grasshoppers & other flying insects. Billions of mosquitos. Seriously. Pack bug spray. They have some there, but pack more. Like 100 deet more cause them suckers will bite you on your face(the only spot you didn’t spray) 😆
The house also have board games, colors and other toys for children.
This is probably one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed at. They executed it in every aspect. So, yeah. Book the house. You won’t regret it."

Claire and Chris were great hosts and responded to all inquiries (yes, you can park you car in the detached garage if there is a storm). The proximity to hiking and mountain biking trails in/around the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge and Medicine Park made adventure easy. The home provided a relaxing and welcoming environment (and quiet!) after days of biking and hiking. While we enjoyed all of the amenities, it was nice to simply enjoy a cup of coffee at the kitchen bar and look out at the land.
But really, you are 45 minutes away from everything- there is no RaceTrack or QT at the corner. Come provisioned and enjoy the simple things!"

The sunset and sunrise views are fabulous. I noticed monarchs overnighting in the bodark trees and scissor-tailed flycatchers on the property as well. Nighthawks and a kingfisher across the road.

Group trip","We stayed at Clarkhous with 3 young adult children and had a great family time. It is super clean and well-stocked, as other reviews have said. It also seems so much bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside! Be aware that it is isolated (which was just what we wanted - that ""get away from it all"" feeling). Plan on a 20-45 minute drive to the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge or area towns. No gas stations super close by, so watch your gas level. Two of the bedrooms are smaller, which is fine for sleeping. The space is in the living areas and master bedroom. The owners were always quick to respond and communicated clearly. Security access is easy to navigate and instructions are clear. It's clear a lot of thought has gone into what a traveling guest might need. Ocasionally the water pressure was a bit weak, but again, I would expect that in a country home with 5 people trying to shower! Highly recommend if you are looking for open country and wide spaces!"

The house is clean and has everything you need to cook and make yourself at home. The space was plenty big for all of us, and we all slept very comfortably. We appreciated the grill. The kids toys, board games, and books were a fun surprise, too! Our favorite part of this house is the location. The house sits at a dead end right next to the Wichita mountains. It is so serene, silent, and peaceful. Our kids loved getting to run and explore in the yard without anyone else being nearby. The drive into the refuge took about 20-25 minutes. It was really nice to stay so close to the refuge and all of its amazing hikes. We will definitely be staying here again!"

Stayed with kids","Not even sure where to start. Before I start boring anyone with this long review, let me say Chris and Claire have to be the best Airbnb hosts there are in the business.  Their thoughtfulness, heart and love for this home is beyond anything we've experienced with any other stay.
We were at Clarkhaus for the coldest weather in 115 years for Oklahoma.  The temperatures dipped to well below zero, snow fell, pipes froze, power went out, you name it.  But Chris and Claire never skipped a beat.  Chris literally spent an entire day defrosting the pipes while making sure it wouldn't happen again during our stay.  They even offered our family a place to stay at their personal home if the pipes did not defrost.
Then Oklahoma started it's rolling blackouts because the grid was getting overwhelmed from the frigid temperatures.  Out of nowhere, Clark had the generator cranked up, connected and we had power.  I cannot say how impressed we are and how we almost feel like we've become friends/family through this stay. 
If you're looking for a home near The Wichita Mountains, Medicine Park, Quartz Mountains, etc, Clarkhaus is your place to stay.  Don't even think about it. Just book it.  The pictures do no justice of the views you'll get.  The home is also well equipped with everything you need, as well as great literature for the nearby areas.  We cannot wait to come back!"

The scenery is unbelievable and provides much needed solace.

We look forward to our next trip and stay."

Stayed a few nights","A stay at Clarkhaus in the winter provides airtight comfort and an opportunity to experience the stark beauty of the foothills of the Wichita Mountains.
We had stayed at Clarkhaus and in the area before, but never during the winter. Both of us are averse to the cold so we travel in the winter with some trepidation. Will our lodging be comfortable or will we spend our time huddling and cursing the cold?
Clarkhaus sits on a rise without natural wind breaks. The temperature dropped low one night and the wind was so strong we could hear it outside. Inside the temperature was moderate and comfortable. The house is airtight and was a wonderful place to take a Christmas trip. No cold drafts or places in the house that wouldn't warm up.
All of the good things you read about Clarkhaus and Chris and Claire here are true. No need to be repetitive. You can believe what you read. We also had the opportunity to meet and spend some time with the nearest neighbors who are just delightful people and were happy to share with us their history and experience of living life in the foothills of the Wichitas.
Consider a winter visit to Clarkhaus and experience the terrain with the winter positioning of the sun. It's like being a part of a panorama with its shifting colors and shadows. It's a great trip with a great place to stay."

Chris & Claire gave very clear instructions for our stay and they had any amenity we needed already available in the house. We came for our anniversary and upon our arrival we found that they had left us a note with a bottle of wine and delicious blueberry muffins. Shortly after we got there Chris came over to cut firewood so we could have a small fire at night. The house was immaculately clean. Our dogs loved having the space in the yard to run around. It was a quick drive to the wildlife refuge where we hiked everyday. My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer! I would definitely recommend Clarkhaus and hope to visit again in the future.

Stayed a few nights","Hands down one of the most incredible, thoughtfully curated spaces we have ever rented. This quaint ranch home is secluded, peaceful, and scenic. The moment we stepped foot inside, we were both gasping at how apparent it was that Chris and Claire have invested so much heart and soul into the space. It is updated, remodeled, and styled to cater to the ranch theme with gorgeous decor and stunning woodwork throughout. We were traveling for our anniversary and were SHOCKED when we found muffins and a bottle of wine with a thoughtful card in the kitchen. Plus, fresh flowers. It was such a nice surprise and again, so thoughtful. We ate the muffins for breakfast every day and they were delish. Also, I am very OCD about cleanliness. I couldn't have felt more in my element. The house was 110% spotless. You can tell they thoroughly clean the house after each stay. The owners are also very detail oriented and supply all renters with a detailed booklet that provides information on the history of the home, what to do in an emergency, local entertainment, etc. We were blown away by the scenic walk right outside the front door that led to a pasture and a beautiful rustic barn with a bench overlooking the mountains. At night, the stars were gorgeous and the silence was so relaxing... we just sat on the couch and enjoyed it! In the mornings, we made a cup of coffee and rocked on the wooden chairs on the front porch. We also felt super safe because the driveway is gated! Plus, the drive to medicine park wasn't far at all - I think 38 minutes. WORTH IT. Trust me! I could rave on and on... this Airbnb is the best in all the area. Hands down. No competition! We SO enjoyed it, and plan to go back!! I've recommended it to all my friends - because the were asking right and left ""where is this!?"" when I posted on social. 10/10 stay!!"

The house is under fifteen minutes from the west entrance of the wildlife preserve, and has all of the maps and guidebooks you need to make the most of your visit. We tend to visit new places and don't often return repeatedly to a spot, but we will continue coming back to the Clarkhaus."

Stayed a few nights","If you want big skies, open space and no noise and distraction of city or town life, you should spend a few days at Clarkhaus.
Clarkhaus sits on an open rise at the foot of the Wichita Mountains. It is starkly beautiful and forty miles from civilization as most people know it. You can see thousands of stars in the nighttime sky, hear the lowing of cattle and the yapping of coyotes, and feel the persistent plains wind.
This 1948 farm house has been completely remodeled with an engineer's eye for detail and a homemaker's sense of comfort. It is immaculately maintained and features all the amenities one wants or needs. Direct written instructions for practically everything about the house, its use, and appliances are provided.
The hosts, Claire and Chris, are responsive but unobtrusive. If you have a few minutes, they are happy to share their experiences of living out here on the prairie. They are knowledgeable, trustworthy, and responsible keepers of this place
The first evening of our stay at Clarkhaus, we sat in rocking chairs in the front yard and watched the strawberry moon rise over the mountains without a care in the world. Just what we wanted.
A fabulous five star plus experience."

Stayed a few nights","Husband and I were looking for a peaceful place to get away for a few days while still practicing social distancing, but also close enough to Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge so we could explore the area. We found in the Clarkhouse what we were looking for and so much more! I will start with the location: If you want to explore beautiful South-West Oklahoma, the house is a just few scenic miles away to the Wildlife Refuge, Quartz Mountain and Medicine Park, just to name a few. Then you come back home to this serene location with absolutely no people around you, and you just want to sit on the front porch or on the wooded bench to zip a glass of wine while savoring the peaceful view and sounds of nature. We loved walking by the old chicken house that is located in the property and waiting for the beautiful sunset there, while hearing the cows, birds and coyotes. You have 15 acres for yourself to enjoy!
Let us talk about the inside of the house: this house is IMPECABLE! Every area is absolutely spotless and the hosts just thought about every little detail to make your stay comfortable. Kitchen is fully equipped and includes all the basics like coffee, tea and all sort of condiments. Keurig machine was a great plus with really good coffee options! We only got to use the master bedroom (the bed was delicious!) and it is a big bedroom with its own bathroom (great shower and good water flow). All bathrooms have soap, shampoo and conditioner dispensers. Plenty of good towels in all the bathrooms.
The house has a comfy living room with TV and there are speakers all around the house so we were able to play our old country music and enjoy ourselves. There are also good books all around the house, so If you are a reader just relax in one of the reclining chairs and read away! There are so many thoughtful details in every corner of this house that I was blown away! This is the type of place you just come and not worry about anything. Just relax and enjoy. But bring all your food and gas because this is a remote location (which is what makes it so perfect) and you will need to drive 45 minutes for provisions.
Last but not least, host communication was fantastic. Claire contacted us a few days in advance to make sure we had the right directions to avoid getting lost. She was checking on us the day of the trip as well and also during our stay to make sure we were doing okay. She and her husband were doing some yard work when we arrived to the property to we were able to meet briefly. They are really nice people and we wished we could have visited with them a little bit more.
We will definitely be back and I am already planning a girlfriends hiking trip since this house will be perfect for a women retreat!"

Stayed a few nights","Clarkhaus is the perfect place for a getaway to the Wichita Mountains/Ft. Sill area. This farmhouse has been completely remodeled, and was absolutely spotless. The location is perfect for a quiet retreat, near the end of a dead-end road on the boundary of the Wildlife Refuge. The kitchen is well-equipped, with new appliances and everything you need to cook a meal. The living room is comfortable, with a tv, roku and music system that are easy to figure out. The bathrooms are modern and nicely appointed. The hosts made getting in and out a breeze, and provide maps and guide books to help you pick your hike in the Wildlife Refuge. The only downside (which was the opposite for us) is that the house is quite a ways from Medicine Park and Lawton (45 minutes), so you need to fill the gas tank and buy your groceries before you arrive. The scenery around the house is wonderful - you can see pasture land up close, with the westernmost peaks of the Wichita Mountains on the horizon to the east. We just got in a quick two-day trip, but we would love to come back and spend a week!"

Stayed a few nights","The farmhouse stay was lovely, remote, and clean with peaceful views. A great location for those interested in visiting the Wichita Mountains refuge since the farm is just a short drive to the West entrance. If you’re interested in good insider tips for hiking or exploring, maps are provided and Chris can give great tips. We had a snafu with the WiFi, which was a frustration on both our part and the hosts; but they extended themselves to try to resolve the issue. It is clear Chris and Claire are goodhearted people and they put a lot of thought and care into the farmhouse, so when you come, know that it is like an extension of their own home rather than a hotel. Bring your own food, water, boots for walking around in those tall grasses, and flashlights for taking your pups out at night. And don’t forget to stop on the porch and look up at the stars."

Group trip","We have a yearly tradition of taking a cabin trip with all of our best friends every January. We switched up the normal location and decided to go to the Wichitas this year.
This was very honestly such a nice place! The amenities were amazing. The kitchen was stocked up with any appliance we could ask for. The WiFi was always cranking away at high speeds, which is super useful in an area where cell reception is scant. The house was incredibly clean and impeccably decorated, and the stereo set-up sounded amazing.
The hosts were kind and even left us a batch of freshly made blueberry muffins to greet us. It's great to have such comfortable and inviting interior furnishings, but if you go outside at night, there's so little light pollution that we noticed stars we'd never seen before.
The Wichitas are a fantastic place to visit, and this particular spot has everything you need to enjoy a lovely stay in one of Oklahoma's most beautiful areas."

We were up there for my Daughters graduation from Ft Sill. It’s only about 39 mins from the base. What is great about it is we could pick our Daughter up and get away from Lawton and go experience God’s country. Great views, walks, etc. The house is located near the wild life refuge, so we could also take the scenic route from the house to Ft Sill. I would highly recommend this property. Our hosts were the best and made us feel at home. Thanks again, btw, your homemade blueberry muffins were AMAZING. :)"

Group trip","""Everyone knows this can happen. People travel and they find places they like so much they think they've risen to their best selves just by being there."" - opening lines of Improvement, by Joan Silber. We liked Clarkhaus so much, we now feel proprietary about it! We feel so privileged so have been there for a few short days. It was the perfect location, allowing us to be near family yet have our own space. And what a space! So clean. So luxurious (those bath towels are fabulous.) The cool, calm colors of the interior work perfectly. Loved the sketches of the fuzzy Belted Galloways - and Claire even brought them over to meet us! My husband was so pleased to have Chris's guidance about the local terrain and he can't wait to return for more boulder-climbing. Above and beyond our expectations, especially when the water heater quit late in the evening and our hosts responded- and fixed it - within minutes."

Stayed a few nights","The bunkhouse was AWESOME and I will definitely be back. It had the feeling of home, especially with the cats. There was one cat that was like the Walmart greeter, we named him Garfield. The whole stay was so nice. This was a family stay to see one of my granddaughters' dance in a nearby town. The triple bunk top bunk was taken down and place in a separate area just outside the curtain of the other bunks. This was PERFECT! I really hope they keep it that way. This gave the kids the sense of having their own space, my son and his wife were able to have the bedroom to their selves and I slept on the bed just outside the kids room. I LOVED IT! It is on a working farm and they have animals. My grandchildren were fascinated. I would sit on the porch in the morning with my coffee and just enjoy. While we were there, a storm rolled in and the tin roof over the porch...AWWWW! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof!!!! Annette's place is the BEST! Tonyia and family"

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed the Welcome Committee of two friendly kittens. Very close to Altus but out of town enough to feel secluded. The bunkhouse stays very quiet- great insulation! The only reason I gave four stars on clean was some dirt and dust in the corners- behind doors and beside bed. There’s a broom there and I swept it up without issue. I know they had plumbing problems before we arrived and all was handled so likely they were focused on other items. It didn’t distract from how great the rest of the room was! Wish it could have put four and a half stars.
Very friendly and chatty.
Will love to stay again when visiting Altus."

I enjoyed seeing her farm animals and cats outside. I appreciated having a bathtub to soak in, with good hot water. I also appreciated that she stocked the refrigerator with various condiments and butter. The weather outside was scorching (110 degrees) and the air-conditioning worked well - it was easily adjustable to our comfort level. If we return to the area, I'd love to stay at the bunkhouse again."

It is a country living area so of course there are insects every where, however seems like they sprayed around there pretty good because even though we saw insects they only got halfway across the floor before they died. And the kitty cats outside are really great at catching the ones that are outside. Lol we enjoyed watching the cats catch insects. The host are friendly and nearby if in case you need anything.

Rachel is the real star of this place. She is responsive attentive, and quick to recommend local eateries. This place was a 40 min drive from Medicine Park which is a must do for families and solo travelers. Her home was just the place my wife and I needed while traveling with our dog and cat. My cat is a fussy traveler and even he approved! This places gets his paw of approval. A must stay when coming to Altus!"

The kitchen was not suited for cooking as there was a lack of cooking utensils and cookware. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area, so that didn't pose a problem for us.
We would stay there again in the future."

Her response was, “just add the additional day to your reservation and I’ll accept it.” We were in the house and settled within the hour. She remained responsive through our entire stay. Anytime I had a question she was prompt and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."

Group trip",I came to Altus from Houston to have my mom's headstone installed at her grave. I reached out to Rachel for a personal request and she honored it without hesitation. she responded to all my messages in a timely manner and made sure I made it to town safely. The house is very cute but the ceilings are low if you have a family of giants like myself. my kids are 6'4 and 6'5 and had to duck under the doorways and ceiling fans. but this was a great place to stay for a quick trip!

But she did her best to help us and even explained it was out at her personal home as well.

The furniture is a little sparse. Basically just the essentials. Since we didn’t spend much time there during the day it wasn’t a big deal.
The interior doors wouldn’t close all the way (didn’t try forcing them) but that didn’t matter to us.
Overall a good value and we’d stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Overall this worked well for our needs. And the price would be hard to beat. Me and family stayed for 5 nights and Rachel was really responsive to questions and messages. If it was just me I would stay there again but if I was bringing my kids again I probably wouldn't.
I mentioned these items to Rachel already, so hopefully some of them will be resolved for the next family staying here.
1. The large tv is a hazard for small children. It was was not secured and the TV stand was barely large enough to hold it. The TV should be secured somehow. We had to work to keep kids away from it.
2. There are slightly raised nails on the threshold to the kitchen that my baby girl scraped her foot on twice. No serious injury thankfully.
3. Some room darkening curtains would be nice for bedrooms. The mini blinds provide privacy but also let in too much light if you want your kids (and your self) to sleep past sunrise). We bought some from Walmart to use for the week and it was worth it.
4. I don't know if this typical in Altus but the mosquitoes got really bad inside the house. We never left the doors open. We all got tons of bites and my son had some really bad ones. We were glad to leave the house when it was time.
5. There were no clear instructions provided for getting rid of trash and other cleaning procedures.
Nit-picky stuff.
1. The tall weeds in the front lawn was not an issue but made a bad first impression
2. Also there was debris in the front yard and driveway which also hurt the curb appeal
Again, hard to compete with the price. But I hope the host will consider improving some of things above."

Stayed one night","Overall, this home was a great stay for the value. It offered our family extra space and a kitchen for less then the cost of a hotel. They also allowed us to bring our pet which is a huge bonus.
I’m not sure that I would list the home for 6 people. It is just two queen/full beds and two regular couches for sleeping. The kitchen table is not big enough to fit 6 and there isn’t enough dishes for 6 people and most of the cooking pans were a bit small for making bigger meals. I would recommend bringing some basic kitchen supplies with you if you will be staying for an extended time.
I would still recommend this as a spot for people to stay in Altus. The host is very helpful and responsive to messages."

I do believe I need to make more lists I ran back to my house too often for forgotten items. Please look closely at what is furnish on the Amenities I’m finding more and more ARBNB are not always stocking shower supplies. One way to use hotel samples.

This was my first ever stay in an Airbnb and Abby's place made it a wonderful experience. The house is beautifully furnished and has all the comforts of home. For me checking in and out was easier than a hotel. I hope to stay at Abby's again when I return to Altus."

Abby was wonderful to work with. Great communication and very accommodating to request for flexible check in.
The home was immaculate upon arrival and was perfect for three adults and three small children.
Definitely will use again if available when family or friends come to visit.
On a scale of 1-10 would give it an 11!!!"

The house was spacious and came with everything we needed and Abby was super responsive and friendly, providing all details needed ahead of time. Our only request if we stay here in the future would be to have it cleaned a little better. There were several dead bugs found on window ledges and throughout the house. Also we’d love for the window covers to not be see through. We covered windows with sheets and towels to help with people seeing in at night. Other than these two items, our stay was perfect."

There were several suggestions for restaurants and things to do and we found our new favorite breakfast taco place. Which is hard to do when you are talking about people who have been coming to Altus since 1943.
They became my new heroes when I saw the family size pan, wok and multiple cookie sheets. The fully stocked kitchen made this our new go to rental for all family visits.
Can't wait to start here again!"

Home is clean and pleasant with cowboy decor. Rooms are all spacious. Beds are comfortable. Very nice linens and towels. Shower is handicap accessible. A car port protected my vehicle since we arrived during a rainstorm.
LOVED the fireplace scene playing on the living room TV when we arrived. Plenty of kitchen tools if we had had time to cook. Bottled water in fridge and coffee for the coffeemaker.
We just needed to spend the night and did not have much time, but really felt at home.

If you are looking for home away from home in Western Oklahoma, this is the absolute place to stay."

Stayed with kids",I really enjoyed my stay here. Came to visit my nieces and nephews. The backyard was a plus for me because of that! The beds were so comfy (I like memory foam though) and the house was very inviting and had everything I needed to take care of my little family! I felt very safe there and the interior was decorated very cute! My only suggestion would be to get a bigger couch in there. I have a feeling it's a newer Aibnb so maybe it's on their list. Even without the bigger couch there was seating for us all. Would have liked to lay on the couch and relaxed to watch TV or snuggle with kids. :) Wonderful place though! I'd stay again hands down!

The beds were super comfortable, plenty of towels and bathroom essentials! Loved that we didn’t have to run out for a cup of coffee, upon waking up😀 everything we needed was in the well stocked kitchen. Definitely plan to return again next year!"

Stayed over a week","The beds were comfortable and there was a constant supply of hot water for 3 guests. The home’s main heating system wasn’t working with negative temperatures outside in December. Called Rose and she had someone at the house to fix the problem. Cleanliness was an issue, but nothing I couldn’t take care of myself. Mark and Rose had plenty of cleaning supplies and a vacuum on site (not sure if dishwasher was in proper working order, because we had to wash the dishes by hand before using). The location was excellent and close to EVERYTHING in Altus. We spent 90% of our time at my son’s home on the Airforce base which was 12 mins away. Would have liked a list of house instructions on how to turn on the gas fireplace with a lighter and specifically where to put our full trash bags (we finally found the outdoor garbage cans after a few days of searching)."

The house is spacious, with three queen size beds a covered patio outside and a carport for your car. The neighborhood is older but well kept up and nice. You see families walking and joggers early in the morning. If we find we need to come out to Altus again we will definitely stay here again."

Group trip","The price for this home was very reasonable. After reading all of the great reviews, we thought this would be perfect for our stay while visiting my hometown a short distance from Altus. I cannot give a good review on cleanliness because there were several things in the home that needed attention and we even had to clean some things ourselves. (I have addressed this with the owner) I will say that the bedding was clean and smelled nice. The beds in 2 of the rooms cover the air conditioning vent on the floor so this keeps the bedrooms from cooling down and we had to leave the bedroom door open to get cool air to circulate. There are no window treatments on the bedroom windows…..the windows are up high but in the morning the sun comes shining through so it makes it hard to sleep in much past sunrise."

The house is a classic from the 70's - complete with pink tile bathrooms and wood paneling. We got a kick out of it. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable - we slept great. The house was a great bargain with lots of room and very clean - which is what is most important. We highly recommend staying here on your next visit to Altus."

Being in the home instead of a hotel allowed me to host and cook dinner for his friends as well as our family, which my airman really appreciated - as did I. So nice meeting the people in his new life. It was a short 20-25 min drive to the beautiful Quartz Mountain - highly recommend visiting that state park if you have time! Mark was an excellent host, and a very good communicator. Highly recommend!"

Group trip","Came for Grammy’s family reunion in Granite. Place was a surprisingly short drive from Granite. Basic double-wide trailer with great big wrap around front porch! Too hot for the dock but that’s just Oklahoma in July!
Nice and peaceful! Kitchen is better stocked than most! Bed linens where great. Towels fluffy and soft. Big bath tub in the master was a plus. Took a cool dip after being in the late July Oklahoma heat all day.
Tons of games and for my big family this was so awesome!
Played games and watched the VCR movies. I loved it! Just like when they were all little. 🥲. (Except with wine and Jameson!). My #6 of 6 leaves for Texas A & M in a week. 😥
Talked all night and got to bed at 4 am! …..we were a little late for Sunday Church of Christ. Oops! God forgives me, right?
All in all, great experience and a lifelong family memory!
Thanks to our host! She responded immediately to any and all questions.

Sheila went above and beyond, last minute to get me in as soon as possible. She was such a blessing to our family. The house is beautiful and spacious! Very clean! Backyard and patio is huge.

Stayed a few nights","Wow. Sheila is incredibly responsive & gracious. Her craftsman home has charming original details & is comfortable in every way. AC, 3 big bedrooms (one w/ a king bed) and an additional half bath. The beds were COMFORTABLE with fluffy pillows. A wonderful rocking chair front porch, a back porch with a grill by the garden & easy parking. The kitchen was exceptionally well equipped with everything needed to cook at home. It’s on the main road but still very quiet; an easy stroll to groceries and quaint shops. Having a 24-hour convenience store so close by was nice. Originally, we were to be staying in Vernon, TX but our place got double booked (only discovered after flying across the country and were headed there in our rental car). Everything around there was booked and we were in a pickle. We messaged Shelia. She was prompt to accommodate our needs and even left us some cookies! Well worth the 30 minute drive from Vernon to have such a rejuvenating place to gather & unwind."
