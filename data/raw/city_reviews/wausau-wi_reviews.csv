Stayed a few nights",Daniel was great to work with. We asked to stay at the last minute and he couldn’t have been more communicative and welcoming. We loved his place and are already planning to return. It’s spotless and he’s made it so cozy and comfortable. The bed was cozy and he has thought of everything to make ones stay lovely

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay and very kindly friend. Take into account that the apartment is upstairs and there are a few stairs to get in, in case you are carrying suitcases or anything big. Besides that, we would say it’s one of the best places to stay in Wausau for two people."

Stayed a few nights","Daniel’s spot is comfy in all ways: on your eyes, on your bum, and on your wallet!
Immediately upon entering the unit I was impressed by the amount and variety of well-kept houseplants.
Furniture is all clean, comfy, and stylish. The living room and bedroom windows welcome in beautiful light in the mornings. The kitchen is adequately stocked with basic equipment, dishware, and cleaning supplies. Native bathroom products of *all* scents are provided. Such a sweet touch!
Being able to sit in front of the large TV (and not have to worry about logging into my own Netflix account!) was a great comfort after a long day.
Daniel was very communicative and ensured we were enjoying our stay. The recommended restaurants and cafes are 10/10, too!
Next time I travel to Wausau I’ll definitely try to book Daniel’s again."

Stayed one night","Daniel was an amazing host! He was very friendly, responsive, and went above and beyond. He said if you need anything please let me know, I'm happy to help and you could tell he was genuine. The place is super cute, very clean and had everything that we needed. We didn't spend much time there as we came for a quick night with plans, but it was so cozy I wished I could have enjoyed the apartment more. He had nice little welcome info along with suggestions on places to eat, drink and play. There was great parking, super cute little yard with the private entrance in the back. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends."

Stayed a few nights",I stumbled across this perfect basement apartment when I was daydreaming about a cozy place to relax and take in nature’s fall colors. I booked it for my long weekend without having a plan and couldn’t have been happier. The apartment was just what I needed to feel comfortable while the quiet neighborhood is tucked back in some beautiful trees with trails near by. I couldn’t have asked for a better escape for the weekend and truly appreciated the time and care that Tim and Alise have put into this place. I highly recommend staying here and have already shared the listing with friends. And I wouldn’t be surprised if I tried to take advantage of the place again in the future. It was just what I needed. :)

So close to Granite Peak + restaurants (lots of recommendations for food and activities in the welcome book). They were very proactive about the parking situation with expected snow which we really appreciated. They also shoveled the sidewalk/guest driveway for us which was very sweet. Sherry and Dean go above and beyond. Will definitely be back the next time we’re in town to ski!"

Everything was SO clean and well organized, including easy-to-find items like an extra blanket. The host was communicative and very easy to work with! She was flexible with our very late arrival and offered to send a forgotten item to us (totally unexpected and so kind)!
It's a touch more spacious than the photos display, but I would say two people is the max :) The area was quiet and it was really easy to find and check-in. If we're ever back in Wausau for a night or two, this will be our spot!
Lots of stuff nearby, too!! We ended up getting breakfast at Tucknee Coffee. Breakfast snobs, we were nervous. It was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this little nook!"

The space was more than enough for my party of 10 people. I’d say the only thing that I found a bit too much of a hassle to do was having to access the garage through the inside of the house. I wish there was a passcode provided for the garage so that we didn’t have to constantly send a person out to go inside the house just to go through the door that leads to the garage to press a button to open it. Other than that, I was satisfied with my stay."

Group trip","Our family Ski weekend was great and having Benjamin’s comfortable home to come back to at the end of the day made it better. The kitchen was well stocked with all of the right pots, pans and etcetera. We all had plenty of space in our bedrooms and the dining space was big enough to fit all of us. The house was close to good dining, breweries and Rib Mountain."

We will always carry these memories made during this trip because of this house and how well it accommodated my family. Ben was extremely nice and also was flexible in letting us in a day early due to the Arctic winter storm. I’d definitely be booking again. The house had everything we needed and more!

Stayed with a pet","Our family recently made a trip north to Wausau WI and were fortunate enough to use the 1611 home for our vacation, we were pleased to say the least.
This is only the second time we used a large vacation home for a trip, but we found the location and the creature comforts perfect for a large group. The home has numerous TVs perfect for when you have 20 somethings along with the - group and it’s supported by a strong Wi-Fi system that allows multiple users to connect even while gaming!
The hosts were excellent at checking in to make sure everything was OK, and we had no problem checking into and out of the property. We can’t recommend this location strongly enough, if you are in need of a large home in the area and want something centrally located and comfortable, look no further!"

The only thing we did notice was that we had to stagger our shower times a good bit because we ran out of hot water, but that’s to be expected with a party of 11. Otherwise, the house was incredibly spacious and immaculately clean. Definitely recommend and we will be staying here again when we visit family."

We came equipped with dishes to cook the meal just in case but were able to use lots in the kitchen as well. The dishwasher wasn't working, but we were able to split up the washing up. The house had different gathering spaces, so we could break off into smaller groups as we wished but gather for game playing as well. All in all, a very nice stay.!"

She reached out to see if I would need anything and was willing to go to the store to pick it up and put it in the apartment for me. Anytime I had a question she answered very quickly if not right away. I would highly recommend staying at her place and would stay there again. Her place is right off a main road, and I thought the traffic might be an issue, but it never was as I am a light sleeper. If you rent her place you will be extremely happy that you did."

It felt like a home away from home and our host was very hospitable from the start. Maddie was very proactive and responsive to messages throughout our stay. The location was very private, peaceful, and intimate. The views of the lake were beautiful to wake up to and look at throughout the day. We really enjoyed the small town vibe surrounding us and there were plenty of stores and places near our apartment to pick up any essentials for our stay. There were also great local stores, restaurants, activities, and outdoor activities for us to explore during our stay. I wish we were able to stay for a few more days, but the memories made will last a lifetime! If you want a private peaceful place to stay for relaxation I couldn’t recommend Maddie’s place more. I hope to one day return to this wonderful stay and create more memories. Thanks Maddie!"

We skiied at Granite Peak during the day, but enjoyed morning coffee curled up in cozy chairs in the sun room overlooking the lake and warmed up by the fireplace in the evenings. It's an idyllic spot - close (10-15 min) to Wausau, skiing, state parks, but removed enough to provide a tranquil home base.
Maddie was very responsive to questions and the house was spotless. I'd highly recommend this house. We're considering going back in the summer when we can use the kayaks to explore the lovely lake."

The fireplace was great & all appliances & heat worked great! Loved the neighborhood . We had a bit of rainy weather so the the fireplace was especially nice after a day of hiking & exploring. JSYK, for those with allergies like me, there were several air fresheners spread around the home. We simple moved them to the basement & it was warm enough to open the windows & air things out. I'm sure Pete would have removed them had I inquired beforehand. While we were there, there was someone living above the garage, although we had no direct contact, there was work activity going on in the parking area just outside the bedroom in the mornings which initially made for some accidental & awkward moments getting dressed & showered .hence the blackout curtains. We just rolled with it. Pete was available & responded promptly to any ques we had."

Stayed with kids","My family spent a long weekend, plus a few days, at The Hidden Cove Cottage to could ski Granite Peak. As soon as we saw the lights on the Slopes as we pulled into the driveway, we knew we chose a good spot! From the outside, the Cottage appeared basic and small, but that initial appearance is deceiving! Thanks to a well laid-out floor plan, the space lives much larger than it actually is. Despite the simplicity of the external architecture (which matches the surrounding neighborhood), the contrasting black and white modern décor inside brings a sense of elegance and prestige. The Kitchen is appointed with all of the tools and equipment necessary to prepare every meal...all in like-new condition. The towels, linens, and bedding (mattresses/pillows) were all high-quality, clean, and comfortable (well above what most hosts supply).
Finally, Pete! He was in almost daily contact, ensuring we had all we needed...and he kept us stocked with wood for the fireplace. We will be back!"

We were able to walk to some parks and the house was close enough to drive to everything we needed. We look forward to staying again in the future! Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","This was a great little house with more amenities than I realized in a quiet, quaint neighborhood. The drive to it is nice, and it’s tucked into a residential area so it feels very comfortable. Other fantastic things about this stay were the clean bedding, fairly clean, and other unexpected things like supplies for baking, tea and coffee, and just an overall warm feeling to the house. The shower is roomy and thankfully tall for my 6’6” boyfriend, and the water pressure and temperature were amazing - better than a hotel! The beds weren’t the most comfortable, and there is a mildewy smell to the home, but there is a large enough bed for a tall person and a candle and room spray make the smell livable. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives. I would definitely stay here again! 😄"

Within walking distance of Wausau sights, activities, & restaurants, so we did not have to look for parking to attend the art fair (September). We were delighted to find Minocqua Brewing presidential beer (Biden Beer and Kamala Stout) around the corner at Downtown Grocery, to the amusement and enjoyment of our families. I highly recommend Jeff and his lodging(s)."

With the bedroom having a sink/counter, that made it slick for us both to get ready in the morning. The spacious common area was pleasant to be in and just right for us. Jeff was also very responsive and accommodating to questions I had. The location near major streets and not far from highway entrances was also handy for arrival/departure and for our Mosinee outing. I would definitely stay here again!"

The neighborhood is very quiet. The heated bathroom floors are wonderful. The mini library sitting room is cozy. Although we did not bring our dogs, its obvious that this is a dog friendly place. The price is reasonable, it’s the additional fees that increase the expense. We had to leave very early so we didn’t clean since we had paid for cleaning. Next trip we will compare with other apps for a lower service fee. Taxes are unavoidable. Overall we had a great stay!"

In a neighborhood with many houses close together but it was quiet and we rarely saw anyone walking around or driving past. What a nice surprise that both bathrooms had heated tile floors! There were a few finishes in the home that could have been completed such as trim pieces and adding a lock on main bathroom pocket door but overall this didn't affect our stay. The host had great attention to detail and everything was comfortable and cozy. Would definitely stay again.

They were all very clear and informative and answered all of my questions. When we got to the house, the place was warmed up and felt like home! We loved the simple designs and bright lighting (although there were a few many unknown switches). Everything was provided as described in the listing and we were very well accommodated as we had everything we needed in the house.

Also, Mai left bottles of water and snacks at the place for us. We will try to stay at Mai’s again the next time we’re in Wausau! Great stay!! :)"

Stayed with kids","I grew up in tomahawk but moved away after high school. My husband and 2 kiddos (2.5yr and 11 weeks) came out for a friends wedding and to visit family. If anyone in your family is a light sleeper you may want to find another home. We didn’t mind that the house is older and had very squeaky floors, thankfully our kids are deep sleepers. We stayed for 1 week total and would definitely stay again. I do recommend for the host to provide more towels! We didn’t ask for more because it wasn’t a deal breaker but we each only had 1 towel for the entire stay. I’m sure Mai or Xao would have provided more had we asked. We didn’t get in until 11:45pm and had easy access to the home. There was 1 bottle of water in the fridge and again, although not a deal breaker I may recommend more water be provided, only because it was too late for us to leave/stop with the kiddos.
Overall we would definitely stay again and I believe Mai and her family are truly great host who care about their airbnb business ☺️"

When I message him he never makes me feel like anything is a bother. He even let us check in an hour early on the day we got there!
Thank you again for making our stay amazing. Even though both times haven’t been for the happiest of reasons I’m happy we didn’t have to stress over anything having to do with our stay."

We enjoyed a walk in the park close by (which was suggested by Jesse’s guide book) and felt right at home in the space. It had everything we needed and is such a clever and creative use of space above the garage. Beautifully crafted space with just enough room for us all to enjoy. Major bonus that it’s pet friendly (with a fenced backyard) and separated from the house! Our dogs loved the peace and quiet of the separate loft and backyard access. Much better than a noisy hotel. Thanks again Jesse for a great stay!

It is close to restaurants and shopping areas. We don't stay at hotels with our dog because she feels compelled to alert us to every squeak in the floor or door closing. We don't rest and I'm sure the rest of the guests aren't thrilled either. At Jesse's place our pooch was quiet as a mouse and we slept great. We would be delighted to stay there again.

Only a few blocks from Monks Botanical Garden, which was a nice surprise. The loft was spacious. Jesse was fantastic and very accommodating as our schedule changed, all around a good experience!

Stayed with a pet","We were in town for 3 nights for a wedding but we brought our dogs so the wedding party hotel was not an option.
Everything was easy and clean. We had 4 adults for 2 nights plus 2 dogs. The fenced in yard was fantastic as our little one likes to get the zoomies.
We had everything we needed. We didn't cook there but there were supplies. Plenty of blankets. We had a parking spot in the garage. If we needed anything, they were super easy to communicate with.
We left a dog toy and they let us know which we're very happy for. It was an old one but our youngest dog loves it a lot so we were able to go back for it.
We would definitely stay here again.
Even with 4 adults and the pull out couch in use, we managed to have plenty of space to move around each other."

The girls had so much fun running in the safety of his fenced in backyard. We had a picnic at Marathon Park and walked along the river. Chopstix had great bourbon chicken for a quick meal to go. The Great Dane let us bring our dogs on the patio while we sampled their brews and menu. I definitely wish we could have stayed longer. As soon as we walked into the loft it felt like home. Definitely would stay again whenever we come back!

It was missing a few kitchen basics like seizors, zip lock bags, cutting board and oven backing pan. And it only had salt and pepper which is fine, I was glad I brought my own olive oil.
Otherwise it was a good place. I never got to meet the owners who lived next door, so, I hallo from them would have been nice. But may be they were respecting my privacy."

I was only there to crash for one night's sleep while in town for the whitewater park, but it would have been a perfect spot for a longer stay. Close to town, nice, quiet neighborhood, plenty of space, comfortable bed. The only thing that was a slight issue for me is that I think someone might have had a pet cat or dog in the apartment not too long before my stay, and I am quite allergic. I knew this was a possibility going in though -- it is advertised as a pet friendly place, which I think is great (many places don't welcome furry friends). Allergy meds worked well and I got a good night's sleep."

Stayed a few nights","The loft was alright. Definitely get your bang for your buck and it was very clean and had all the basic essentials. However, the “private hot tub” wasn’t very private it was located next to the back porch on the far side of the owners house so we had to walk through the unshoveled path to the hot tub which is about 50 ft from the loft. Also the shower was disappointing… water pressure too high, too small for my bf of 6’3 to fit properly, and only mens body wash & sauve shampoo and conditioner (which I won’t use). Someone parks in the garage right underneath the bed in the loft and it’s a loud garage door…"

The hosts thought of everything we might possibly need/want during our stay and had it on-hand there, easily accessible! All of the amenities here were just what we were looking for, and it truly was a weekend full of rest, relaxation, and quality family time together while visiting my mother-in-law. She was impressed too! And we slept so well on the memory-foam mattresses and super-soft bedding in the rooms on the main level (didn't need to utilize the bed or futons downstairs but loved that the home had multiple options for sleeping arrangements). You have a beautiful home here and we'll 100% be looking to stay here again anytime we visit Wausau! THANK YOU!!!!!!"

Was able to run to Duck island. One of my hangouts as a teen back in the late 70’s. It was a great space to decompress after busy days saying goodbye to my dad. Lots of places to sleep, perfect amenities, super clean. Close to groceries, great coffee, and restaurants. Thank you 😊"

After travelling for 4 hours with a toddler, it was kind of a hassle to have to deal with an incorrect door code. Luckily the back door was unlocked for some reason so we were able to get in without waiting the hour that it took the host to respond. It would be helpful if checkout instructions were printed instead of sent via the app because I'm not always on my phone and don't really want to be receiving another message during my trip."

They had a leash, dog dish, dog food if you forgot yours, poop scooper, dog bags, and even a basket with toys in! Just amazing! We walked 4 miles each day and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful and there is a park, Schofield Park, almost 2 blocks away which we walked to! The park runs alongside the Wisconsin River! Pretty area! Both were very responsive with any questions and check in was simple! We loved that we could open the door up from the kitchen and let our dog out into the fenced in backyard and not have to go outside of the house at all! There is a patio table and chairs to sit at outside and there is a grill, but we did not use it at all! We definitely will be back, very nice place! Thank you!"

It is an older home but they have made it feel a bit more updated, especially the bathroom that was pristine. Quiet walkable neighborhood. Great fenced in back yard for our dog. Cozy bed with a luxury feel and lots of towels! The kitchen literally had everything but the food! Loved sitting out back on the patio area. We did not use the garage but we would if there had been bad weather or snow. Much better than a hotel! Great hosts. Next time we will bring a peppy toy to share. :)"

Stayed a few nights","Family members gathered in Wausau for a stay including Mother’s Day weekend. Some stayed with our grand-daughter and her family who live in Wausau, and the rest of us stayed at Gary’s Airbnb. The airbnb was a very short walk from our grand-daughter’s, scoring very high for convenience. My husband and I slept in an amazingly comfortable king bed on the main level, while the others stayed upstairs (also very comfortable beds). They raved about the rooms, especially the beautiful master bedroom suite and bathroom. I did not go upstairs myself because of an ankle issue and the fact that the steps seemed too challenging for me, despite the sturdy handrails. Other, younger members of the family had no problems, dashing up and down. Gary mentioned the steps so we were not taken by surprise. The house was very well kept up, rooms were large, furniture was comfortable, décor thoughtfully chosen, the kitchen well-equipped, and the porch great for hanging out. We will happily return."

I loved that it had 4 bathrooms! I also loved that pets were not allowed. I love animals so much and wish I didn’t have severe allergies but unfortunately for me that is not the case. It is very hard for me to find a place to stay that doesn’t allow pets these days so I end up having really bad allergies and can’t really enjoy my time away from home. This placed allowed me to enjoy my time away and feel like I was right at home.
The home owners also left a gift baskets full of snacks that my kids loved! If I were to stay in Wausau again I would definitely hope this home was available and I would definitely book it again."

Group trip","A few days before our trip Carlos sent a message regarding check-in and instructions. When the date came this made it extremely easy to find the house, get in, then settle in according to house rules. We saw there was an attached garage which we thought would be very useful being it was winter when we took our trip. I messaged Carlos about using it and I got an immediate response. We were able to pull into a clean empty garage so we could unload our luggage inside. This was very handy throughout the trip. When booking this house the things that stuck out most were the location and the cleanliness, both of which made the trip very enjoyable. The location of the home advertised that it was a short drive to Granite Peak which was true and even on a snow day the drive was short and easy. Not only was it close to the ski hill but other places such as, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. We had a 5 star stay at this cozy home in Wausau WI, and I would absolutely recommend this to others!"

Stayed with kids","Clean, comfortable, and very good deal. It was my parents’ first stay at an Airbnb and they kept saying, “why would anyone book a hotel if you can do this!” Would definitely recommend this place. Beds were wonderful, welcome snacks were delicious, and the location was excellent for accessing downtown. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Our family loved Carlos' place! He thought of everything - it accommodated our needs so well... AND it felt just like home! We came home at the end of a long day and looked forward to relaxing. Having bathrooms on each floor was a bonus and the fenced in back yard was great for the kids to play with no worries. Location is convenient for getting around anywhere in the Wausau and surrounding area as it is right off the main expressway. The neighborhood is quiet and well kept. We didn't need to use the basement, but it looked great for work and fun. I highly recommend this place and would absolutely stay there again. Thanks Carlos!"

Stayed with kids",My family of 6 loved this location for a snowboard weekend at Granite Peak. The lake was frozen and the kids enjoyed walking around and seeing vehicles and ice fisherman on the ice.

Stayed with kids",The home was very clean and cozy. The decor really fit with the lake house theme. My wife and kids very much enjoyed fishing off the dock for sunfish and perch. You can't beat the lake view from the back porch and living room.

Stayed with kids",Extremely clean and well stocked. Local host was very quick to respond to questions. Would love to have kayaks or canoes available. Lake not suitable for swimming due to algae and seaweed but good for fishing. Enjoyed the county fair rodeo near by and Rib Mountain State Park.

Group trip","The cottage was just what we need for a weekend ski trip. It’s located <10mins away from Granite Peak so it was easy to get there and back.
The Evolve team was easy to reach. I accidentally booked the stay for 4 guests but I reached out via email and we were able to add a 5th guest no problem. Later on I asked to add 2 more guests but the request was denied because the cottage only sleeps 6 people. I mentioned the 7th person had no problem sleeping on the couch for 2 nights but the request was still denied. While I understand I booked a place that said “sleeps 6”, it seemed to me like a request they could easily accomodate to add one more person given they would just take the couch.
Even still, we had a nice stay and can’t really complain. The Evolve team was responsive so our friends were able to make a reservation elsewhere."

Group trip","Such a pretty home with such a pretty view! Booked for a bday ski trip with friends and it was perfect. It was only 15 minutes away from Granite peak and right in the middle of just about everything you could’ve needed. The book filled with instructions and Restraunt recommendations was so nice, as well as the little book you get to sign at the end of your stay. Water heater had broke last minute before check in, Host communicated everything and was so nice, was updated all the way through. Loved staying here would recommend and do it again!"
