Stayed a few nights","So, it was a cold two nights in Buffalo. The heating system wasn't working (at all) and even though the host offered up a space heater -- it was still freezing cold. The thermostat was hidden in the bedroom, and when I complained about the cold they said to turn it up -- but it was broken. I replaced the batteries, and it still didn't work. Basic maintenance would have avoided this problem. The living room floor is covered in carpets and was very dusty, and I woke up sneezing both days. The moment I left, the sneezing stopped. And then the couch in the living room! You could feel the steel coils through the cushions, making it a unusable. There are gaps in the windows where a large air conditions sits. I've been in a lot of airbnb's lately, and this was the first to really disappoint."

Stayed a few nights","Such a gorgeous quaint space. Every area has been treated with love so there’s something beautiful to look at everywhere. Ms Tamera does her thing with art 👌🏾 just so divine . There’s a Gorgeous tree out front for nature lovers and I even got to see some beautiful birds up close. The bed is very comfortable, and there were no issues. Everything was a breeze. I left there even more inspired 😊✨ ."

Stayed over a week","I was in Buffalo for work and stayed at Tamera’s place for 6 months. The place felt like a home away from home. Whether you are in Buffalo for a couple of days or an extended period of time, I can’t recommend a better place than Tamera’s! No issues whatsoever. The apartment is pristine and very clean. Tamera is a very attentive and detail oriented host. Very responsive to any requests should you have any. But you won’t, because there will be nothing you would need! Tamera’s place has it all! Would definitely stay again when in Buffalo!"

Stayed a few nights","It was EASY to find and to access, which is wonderful because I booked this for my college age son to stay here for a swim meet. I was a bit concerned that he might have a hard time finding the place and getting in. Super easy for him. Had everything he needed - including a bathtub for an ice bath - and even the street parking was easy for him.
Thank you for everything!"

Stayed about a week","Our stay in Tamera's charming second floor flat was delightful; it had all the amenities that a traveling couple would desire, i.e., a well equipped kitchen, comfortable bedroom, excellent air conditioning (including ceiling fans) which cooled the entire space, combined dining room/living room which was perfect for having our meals, and streaming our videos in the evening hours.
The location, in a neighborhood a wee bit funky, with colorful characters roaming the streets, was just also about 4 blocks from Kleinhans Music Hall, and a short drive to the Elmwood District, a very pleasant area for shopping and dining. While I had not previously spent much time in that part of Buffalo, we were very impressed with the beauty of the houses, etc. It was also very convenient to the highways, making trips north, as well as that to and from the airport, easy and expeditious.
I found our week-long stay to be relaxing and restorative. Tamera, whom we met on day 7, was similarly delightful."

Stayed over a week","Tamera's place is absolutely everything you could want from an airbnb. Clean, cozy, comfortable and had everything I needed for my month-long stay. The bed was super comfortable, shower was amazing, and the kitchen was definitely mighty! It was great having the washer and dryer available and Tamera was wonderful at making sure I had everything I needed.
My only cons would be that it got a little loud at night with cars and motorcycles on the street and the door was kinda loud. I felt bad leaving in the morning because I didn't want to wake the downstairs apartment but there really isn't a quiet way to leave. The stairs are a little steep and makes it hard to move in and out.
I really loved staying here and Tamera was the best host! Definitely recommend."

This is a lovely airbnb. I stayed here for three months and had a great experience. The apartment is clean and well furnished. Having access to the washer and dryer in the basement was a huge plus as well. Tamera was always responsive and communicative for the few issues that did arise. On a final note the apartment is only a 10-15 minute walk from a place called The Melting Point which has the absolute best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had. I would happily stay here again if I come back to Buffalo."

It’s in a great location, within walking distance to grocery stores and coffee shops. It’s a short walk to the main Allentown strip which has tons of restaurants, bars, and shops. There’s also a bus stop a block away that takes you to downtown and near the waterfront. The apartment itself has everything you’ll need for a stay, with the kitchen and bathroom filled with all of the essentials. The air conditioners and ceiling fans were awesome to have, and the laundry in the basement was a great plus for a week-long stay. The Wifi was reliable and fast, which was very important since both my husband and I were working remotely. Tamera was a fabulous host. She was friendly, but also very respectful of our privacy. She checked in with us to invite us out from time to time or make us aware of events that were happening in the area. This was a great experience and we would definitely make sure to stay here again next time that we’re in Buffalo!"

The whole place is really thoughtfully put together so you can feel totally at home, and this is one of my favorite buffalo neighborhoods. The apartment layout is unusual, but it makes the place feel more spacious than its actual size. It's fully decorated, so none of that sterile generic airbnb feel, but all the clean crispness you want. The kitchen is small but literally had every little thing I could think of which made everything easy, I cooked dinner every night I was there. The bike path along the river and outer harbor is just down the street, and it's walking distance from so many cute parts of Buffalo, so many beautiful historic homes. You won't regret staying here, it's absolutely lovely."

There’s so much detail you just don’t get from the pictures, and to be how it all comes together in one spot , the cohesiveness, is a huge part of the experience . The second you step in the door,
You are just absolutely delighted. It has a great vibe, and you just want to drop your stuff and start checking it all out up close .
The hosts are the flat out most friendly , responsive people you’ll ever come across, which adds to the ambience of the place and overall experience . I’m local , and I’ll be back for sure. I literally live a couple
Blocks away, and that says Everything about how special this place is. It’s a wonderful and unique addition to Buffalo, from two absolutely lovely people."

The look on my husband’s face when we entered the space was priceless! (He didn’t know where we were staying) we quickly had to meet friends for dinner and we couldn’t wait to get back and explore the place more and check out all the details! I think we looked around until the minute we closed the door behind us! I recommend this spot to any and everyone!

The only missing info from the pictures and description from accessibility standpoint would be it’s an upstairs apartment. But that does not take away from the overall experience of the space, its location. I’ll definitely keep it on my list of spaces to check its availability if I’m in town again. Hope they bring this look to more spaces."

Stayed one night","The 2D Spot was perfect for our night away! We came to town for a Sabres/Leaf’s game and the apartment was only a few minutes from the border and 10 minutes away from the Keybank Centre. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful if that is what you are looking for. The space has street parking only but I felt at ease leaving my car overnight given how quiet the neighborhood was.
The space itself was amazing. The photos do not do the artwork justice! Every little detail was thought of. It was a very cool space and highly recommend.
Stephen and Habiba are excellent hosts. Communication was clear and always very responsive! I accidentally broke a glass upon our arrival and wanted to let them know. They were easy going about the accident and put me at ease as I was quite embarrassed. All of the check in/out were clear and easy to understand.
I cannot say enough good things about the space and our hosts. I would definitely rebook in the future!"

Only thing, my wife is 5’11 and felt like a giant in the place and the shower is not enjoyable if you have any type of claustrophobia. If you didn’t get the chance, look up the place on TikTok and watch the artist complete the project!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved our stay at this Airbnb! It was so much fun admiring the quirky 2D spot. Habiba and Stephen were incredibly sweet and accommodating as usual. The spotlessly clean, all black and white space in a safe and quiet neighborhood near downtown Buffalo made our stay even more enjoyable. Convenient parking right in front of the house was a plus. This marked our second stay with Habiba and Stephen, and they never disappoint. Proximity ensures quick responses to our questions and seamless assistance with any requests. The addition of a coffee machine with a fantastic selection of roasts was a delightful surprise, adding a cozy touch. Checking in was a breeze thanks to self check in keypad entry. What sets this Airbnb apart is not just the cleanliness but the attention to detail, including top-line toiletries that elevate the experience. The rooms' minimal yet beautiful design remains a personal favorite. Needless to say, we'll keep coming back – it's become our go-to choice in Buffalo!"

Area was nice and quiet and accessible to lots of local cafes and restaurants. The place is not meant for luxury but comfort and it did the job!

The place was like the pictures. To the eye, the neighborhood was a a bit run down; but the street was quiet, the people were nice and it felt safe and walkable. A 30 minute walk allowed us to explore several other areas; so the location was great. In the shadow of the Peace Bridge, which made going over into Canada convenient."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, the place was fine. It was clean and we had control of the thermostat so we could adjust the temperature. Unfortunately, there was very little hot water in the chilly Buffalo winter. This discouraged us so much that we sometimes skipped showering. Another downside was the overhead light in the living room was clearly broken and hanging crookedly. To be fair, we did not contact the host about these problems because we were only here for a few days. Before our trip, I messaged the host asking for recommendations of things to do in the area. He named a tourism website and directed me to research for myself. This was nice, but I was hoping for a more personal touch. Overall the place was warm and comfortable, the kitchen was well-equipped with pans and dishes, and the beds and sofa were very nice. If you're looking for a reasonably priced home base and you're otherwise planning to spend the day out and about, especially in summer, this could be a good option"

I would not feel comfortable walking/jogging in this neighborhood however I did find a park about 10 - 15 minutes away, Delaware Park. It was easy to get to and a nice place to jog around the lake."

Stayed a few nights","I recently stayed at Ward and Sandra's Airbnb, and I can confidently say it was by far my best Airbnb experience to date. From the moment we arrived, Ward and Sandra went above and beyond to ensure my partner, brother and his wife felt completely at home. Their warm welcome and genuine hospitality set the tone for a fantastic stay. The space was beautifully decorated, impeccably clean, and equipped with all the amenities one could possibly need. The cozy atmosphere made it a perfect retreat after our busy days exploring the area and my marathon race!
What truly stood out was Ward and Sandra's attentiveness and willingness to accommodate our needs. They were always available to answer questions, provide recommendations, and assist with anything we required. Truly, superhosts!
Overall, Ward and Sandra's Airbnb exceeded all our expectations. I highly recommend their place to anyone looking for a top-notch stay. Thank you, for making our trip so special – we can't wait to return!"

Stayed one night","This was one of the most surprising and unique stays I have had in all my years of travelling (so far).
What had initially sparked my interest in the former Temple was the architecture, the restoration efforts, and history of it. This interest was soon consumed by information the hosts shared with me about the function of the building now. It is a family home and research & development centre for an important mental health & nutrition initiative.
Please take some time to look into Vitamin Greens and what their initiatives aim to solution for. Especially if you are interested in, live or practice holistic health. I learned so much!
Our hosts were warm & welcoming. An incredible treat to stay in such a magnificent historical building. Our unit was bright, impeccably clean, very unique & soothingly peaceful. All of the mod cons & the most comfortable bed. Walking distance to all that you’d want. It’s a pity we weren’t staying longer! You could easy work remotely from here. We will return!"

We loved the fireplace and bathroom and the sinks in the kitchen . Everything was so clean and exactly as advertised. Ward and Sandra were super helpful and responsive. I found the research project fascinating that the funds from the stay supports .
I am a big believer in letting your food be your medicine and how important it is to take care of our own ‘temples ‘ . I would definitely recommend staying in this impressive place which is also located in a great neighbourhood. Much gratitude and appreciation to the ideal hosts !"

Easy to heat up the room/loft and bed was comfortable . One annoying factor was noisy footsteps in the morning ( from around 7 am ) directly above the loft .
Lots of good information regarding the city and things to do. eat and see and there was plenty of evidence of the other significant project Vitamin Greens , within the building .
We would stay there again when we are next in Buffalo ."

I entered the Temple upon our arrival and just sat there for 30 minutes, observing the windows, cowed by their timemline and significance and enjoying the quiet and gradeur. The underlying purpose of this AirBnb made the stay extraordinary, and the price did not align with the experience. In other words - so well worth the cost. Such accessible, intelligent hosts welcoming you to an historic structure in a city full of art, music, food and very friendly people - you can't ask for more. We're coming back!"

- Easy access to the Airbnb & easy instructions.
- Its a very unique layout and has everything you need.
- For the ladies there’s a Dyson Blow Dryer/Diffuser which was so amazing because I forgot my diffuser :).
- the basketball court 10/10
Cons:
- the sofa bed is not the most comfortable
- the window that separates the kitchen & bathroom has a frost to it but still see through.
- when showering the water tends to accumulate and go into toilet area so you have to use the tool to sweep the water, constantly
Definitely recommend this Airbnb to people who are couples!"

The research represented by Vitamin Greens is endorsed by NASA. The research team is an open and inclusive community, and they welcome you to join if you're interested.

Top of the line appliances and dyson hairdryer. Only complaint was the shower area. The floor was unlevel and the water ran the opposite direction of where the drains were located and under a small section of wall where water ran into the kitchen where a drain extended under the wall. We had to use the floor squeegee with one person pushing the water towards the drain side while the other showered to eliminate water running past the toilet and into the kitchen from the shower nearest the toilet. Otherwise, fantastic experience!"

The kids loved playing basketball in the basement and exploring all of the secret passageways. Waking up in the morning and having coffee in the synagogue sanctuary with new friends was the highlight of our trip.

Stayed with a pet","This was the most unique Airbnb we've ever stayed at (in a good way). The entire place is a marble wonder, and all the appliances are high tech (Samsung), including an induction stove top. Although it isn't the largest square footage, the ceilings are so tall that you never feel cramped. The unit gives a ""spa"" feel with a double shower. The building used to be a temple, and there is NASA research on plants going on in the building (super cool). Ward and Sandra were super attentive and excellent hosts. The bed was super comfortable, and there even was a huge standing desk that we worked on. Also, the area had local shops and vegan restaurants within 10 min. driving distance. A quick note that there is not a microwave in the unit. If you're looking for an airbnb unit that is more than a cookie cutter unit, look no further. Staying at Ward and Sandra's place was a pleasure and we would love to come back."

Stayed one night","This is an incredible, unique stay!! It’s worth stopping by just to see this beautiful place and relax there for a night — let alone the excellent location within ~20 min walk to tons of shops and restaurants.
Ward and Sandra responded to messages quickly and kindly. These are the kind of hosts you hope you’ll run into and get to spend some time with — folks who clearly care about the place you’re staying deeply.
The unit itself was INCREDIBLE! The sleek marble and modern appliances were so cool. I mean, a Dyson hair dryer?! Plus the provided toiletries smelled amazing and were actually high quality — not the cheap watery stuff you might be use to.
Staying for just one night was amazing, but I’m hoping to come out for a longer stay sometime soon, because this place has everything you could need or want for a long-term stay. Laundry facilities and high-quality products, a dishwasher, high-end workout equipment, I could go on forever.

Stayed one night","This loft is EXACTLY the reason you want an Airbnb and not a hotel. It’s so wonderfully unique and stylish, Airbnb would be wise to feature it in an upcoming commercial. We kept discovering small and large surprises in the common areas: coffee and tea on a piano in the morning, a networked printer that let us print out the parking pass we got that day, a two net basketball court, an exercise area overlooking rows of pews inside of a gorgeous former temple? Check, and wow.
One thing that may not be totally clear from the photos is the quality of work and products that Ward and Sandra put into this: thick, luxurious towels in the shower, incredible bed linens, high end German shower fixtures, a Japanese toilet that does everything but give you advice on your diet, and stunning white marble surrounding you.
Ward and Sandra are also incredibly responsive hosts, giving personal advice on restaurants and some of the local colleges we were visiting. Look no further, this listing is a gem."

The hosts were extremely communicative and reached out often to make sure everything was well. The only concern I had was unfortunately not within their control—due to the structure of the home and its age, the walls are very thin and you can hear the other tenants easily. I could hear phones ringing, footsteps, vacuuming, and at one point could even hear conversations. This was hard for me as I tend to be a light sleeper and a lot of the noise was in the bedroom. Other than that, I had a great stay and enjoyed the apartment, its cleanliness, and attention to detail."

The apartment was SUPER close to downtown Buffalo - very walkable to great food, bars, breweries, and grocery stores in the area. The house was in a nice, quiet neighborhood, had plenty of parking, all of the amenities that you could want for in an apartment, and was very clean! The home smelled great when we walked in - the shower was SOO refreshing after a long 8 hour drive! And the bed was GREAT to jump into after a long day of exploring the city. Niagara Falls was about a 25 minute drive from the house as well. Finding a better location to visit Buffalo/Niagara would be tough to beat! When we return to Buffalo, we will definitely book here again! Krzysztof and Agnieszka were SUPER responsive, and also proactive in their communication."

There is everything you’d need to cook or make a cup of coffee/tea. The bed is SO COMFY!! The office is my favorite room with so much natural light during the day.
The best part is everywhere we drove was only a few mins away. Niagara Falls was under 30 mins. We even took a day trip to Toronto and it was only 2 hours away. If I ever go to Buffalo again, I’ll be sure to book this place.
I can’t say enough positive things about this place and if anything isn’t up to par they are quick to make it right and very responsive on the app. Highly, highly recommend. Just book it already!"

The kitchen is well equipped, and there are thoughtful extras throughout the unit. The off-street parking is a big plus, and the neighborhood was quiet. While the apartment itself is charming, the hallway and the parking area are still a work in progress. The laundry is in the basement and is free, but shared with the other occupants of the building.

My favorite amenities were the INCREDIBLY comfortable king mattress and the multi-nozzle shower. This is a first-floor apartment in a very old house full of character. It is important to note that while we did hear neighbors walking around upstairs, it was mainly during our waking hours, which was manageable. Nights were wonderfully quiet, considering we were in the heart of the city. Easy walk to such favorites as Gabriel's Gate and the Founding Fathers pub. Super modern on the inside while retaining its originality. Heating/AC was responsive, shower pressure and WiFi excellent. Also a nice Roku setup and lots of Keurig offerings. I'd stay again!"

We would suggest bringing your own pillows as they are very limited but everything else is great."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved staying here and it was one of the highlights of our trip. We honestly liked the decor/styling a lot better than our house! haha and we asked for some details on the specific mattress and diffusers they used because it was so amazing. The space is extremely well decorated and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook, and then some. We would have been happy with just the bedroom, bathroom and kitchen - so the super cute living room and sunroom just felt like a bonus. It was really cold in Buffalo when we visited so we couldn't wait to come back each day and get cozy at the apartment. Not one negative thing to say, one of the nicest places we've stayed at."

Coffee, tea and even filtered water cold in the fridge. Kitchen supplies, blankets, and games were all available, too. The photographs of Buffalo, NY on the wall were original and taken by the owner which made it feel so cozy. The communication was great and detailed. 100% worth the cost. It’s on the quiet part of the street but still very central to downtown activities."

Stayed a few nights","This was, hands-down, the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Let me tell you why. First, the description is exceptionally accurate. All of the photos are current, not trying to hide anything, or misrepresent anything. I can’t begin to describe to you the level of detail the owners paid attention to when creating this space. They thought of everything. There is glassware for every type of drink, a first aid kit, they even have scissors and stationary in the desk at the workspace. All the appliances are high end and brand new. The decor is attractive, yet very comfortable. The bed is so comfortable that I slept far longer than I should have. There are toiletries and supplies in the bathroom. The spice cabinet in the kitchen actually has spices in it. Things are labeled. There is enough of everything. Check in was super simple and very clear. I even extended my stay for a fourth night. The apartment is very well located for access to downtown, and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. There is one within a few steps of the Airbnb. The owners also gave excellent recommendations for restaurants and activities. I doubt that I will be back in Buffalo, because passport business brought me here. However, there is no question that if I were to visit again, I would come straight back to this apartment. I could go on about this place, but I think you get the idea. I should also clarify that I do not know the owners, and I rarely leave more than a few sentences and reviews. As soon as I walked in and took a look at the place, I thought “I can’t wait to write a review about how awesome this is.“"

This apartment is located in the historic Allentown area of downtown Buffalo and the building that it resides in is from the 1800s and is very well kept and beautiful. The neighborhood was quiet and had restaurants and shops within walking distance.
Krzysztof was great with communication, recommendations and very helpful when we had questions about our stay. Thank you so much, Krzysztof! We would love to return to your place on our next trip to Buffalo!"

The apartment itself was modern and clean, with what looked like new appliances (although there was no need to cook) and a spa-like shower that has perfect water pressure. The bed was very comfortable to sleep in and the temperature in the building was ideal.
The owners seem to really pay attention to the details - from the interesting books available on the shelf to the Keurig with coffee options. Lovely stay that I plan to do again very soon."

Stayed a few nights","Dianne's apartment is just as described in the listing. It's in a great location, with easy walks to restaurants, shops, and the Farmer's Market. The neighborhood is great. The inside of the apartment is totally comfortable, clean, and well-appointed. We enjoyed eating in the dining room and sitting on the sofa for evening chit-chats. There is parking on the street and behind the house, though the driveway is a little narrow. The porch is a typical Buffalo porch -- enough room to seat several people and hide out from the rain while watching people walk their dogs on a chilly, autumn evening. All in all, we had a great stay."

Our bedroom window was next to the room/kitchen where they were drinking and playing drinking shot games. They were loud !
We were ok until 10 pm, but the party went a tad bit longer than we thought. We ended up sleeping on the floor in the living room.

Stayed with kids","Our stay was during a major blizzard. The “storm of the century” they called it! Before the weather hit, Dianne sent a friendly suggestion to stock up on food in case we were snowed in, which ended up being the case. As the community endured the major event, Diane checked in on us daily to make sure we were safe and warm. Thankfully, we never lost power (unlike many in the neighborhood and surrounding areas). The home was cozy and comfortable and we had the “White Christmas” we were hoping for. We made a snowman in the back.
As our departure date approached, Dianne was super flexible and let us extend our stay until the travel ban was lifted. We actually ended up extending our stay a second time because we were so comfortable in her home. The furnishings were lovely. The home was clean with plenty of towels and linens. And space to come together as a family. There aren’t words to describe how amazing Dianne was. Although we never met in person, we grew a bond by the time we left."

Stayed with a pet","We seriously want to live in this house! Honestly, we really can't say enough great things about it and about Dianne. The house felt very safe, updated, and clean. The weather was a bit warm the week we were there and the AC worked perfectly. The kitchen is beautiful and includes all of the comforts of home. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is a nice size with plenty of towels and lots of places to hang wet towels and clothes. The internet and TV also worked flawlessly for our entire family. But as great as the house is, the location is even better! A quick walk to awesome food, multiple coffee shops, cocktails, and of course shopping on Elmwood. It's also really close to Delaware Park, the Zoo, and the museums... not to mention a quick skip and a jump to Canalside and Allentown!
We feel like Dianne really thought of everything with this house down to the littlest details. After 3 long years of being away from Buffalo, my family and I had a great stay in the heart of Elmwood Village. Would (and will) book again. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Mary’s place was perfect for our weekend stay. We were a group 3 and there was plenty of space for us. The unit is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and location wise it was perfect as it was so close to many of the popular US stores such as Target, Walden Galleria (Primark, Cheesecake Factory), etc —literally a 5-7 min drive!
The unit was easy to find (as Mary left clear instructions) and equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay including dishes, utensils, coffee maker, a huge fridge as well as a washer and dryer (a rarity on Airbnb)! It was clean, the beds were comfortable and we loved that there was a TV in both rooms in addition to the living room with plenty of subscriptions to choose from (Pluto, Netflix, etc).
Highly recommend and I will not hesitate to stay here again when I visit Buffalo. Thanks, Mary!"

We didn't have good weather (lots of rain) but in more pleasant weather, I imagine we would not have needed a car much at all (we ARE big walkers though). Elmwood Village, AKG Art Museum, Buffalo History Museum and Forest Lawn cemetery are all very close by.
The building, itself, is quite old (with lots of character), but it's worth noting that, because of that, creaky floorboards and sometimes noisy co-tenants can make it a bit hard to sleep :)
That said, Ron was a gracious host and we enjoyed our time in Buffalo. Thanks Ron!"

The kitchen was also nicely appointed with a Keurig coffee machine, creamer in the refrigerator, and dishes and utensils. We found that the small shower, which had been commented on in other reviews, met our needs perfectly and we liked its ledges for the placement of miscellaneous items such as shampoo, etc. While there is a narrow stairway to access the apartment, the two landings really make a helpful difference when carrying luggage. The property is in a beautiful area of Buffalo and near the Elmwood Village area. It took about 20 minutes to walk to the Lexington Co-op which is a small neighborhood grocery store on Elmwood Avenue which has ready-made sandwiches, soups, etc. We also enjoyed the nearby Aquacates Mexican Bar & Grill restaurant, also on Elmwood."

The house is old, and the rooms could use another coat of paint, but everything was extremely clean, spacious, decorated but not overly so, and every amenity you can think of was provided. The bed was very comfortable; there were plenty of towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo, and dishwasher soap. There was a/c if needed; and the kitchen had plenty of utensils. I saw Ron twice, once coming in and once going out, and he was anxious to make sure that I had everything I needed. The parking lot was out back, and it felt safe to park there. All in all it was a great place to stay."

Finally Sunday Christmas day, power was restored around noon. My guest and I walked to a family members home to spend xmas. the next morning, the day I was supposed to leave, I was informed by the owner that another person had rented for the 26th. I had asked the host if my son could walk back, clean out the fridge, pack up our belongings and store them until a travel ban was lifted He was accommodating, for which we were thankful"

Wonderful hot water pressure, large fridge for drinks and restaurant leftovers, off street parking.. We were even excited to see a little fan (it’s exactly like the one we keep next to our bed at home). The bed was super comfy and there was plenty of space for unpacking/relaxing. When we make it back to Buffalo, we will definitely be staying with Ron again. He was so quick to respond when we reached out. I almost forgot about the location. The studio is on a charming street that is centrally located. 20 minute drive to the falls, 10 minutes from the airport, I never paid over $10 for an Uber into Buffalo. Be sure to check out the brunch at Betty’s, the Beef of Weck at Sideline’s Sports & Grill, the Stuffed Peppers at Bada Bings and the Salmon Benedict at Eggsperince (walking distance, around the corner)."

Easier to enter from street than off -street parking lot, though latter is closer to building entrance. No cleaning fee - policy is to leave suite as you found it. Check out is 10 am."

It's spotlessly clean and lovely. The kitchen was delightful, the bed comfortable, the deck is great to sit out on with a beverage and relax.
The decor is really fun and comfortable. Charming little touches everywhere you look.
Plentiful hot water for showering, which is a big plus to me.
I can see this as perfect for a romantic get away, or a nice place to relax to get away from stress.
I hope to be back next year."

Stayed a few nights","Great stay! Spacious studio on top floor of large home was very quiet. Pictures don't quite do it justice--it isn't a single room--there is a separate kitchen and work nook with 3-prong outlet in addition to very large living/bedroom. Easy to leave my car in the driveway space and walk to the Metro or bus, and if you love walking like I do, walkable to Delaware Park, Elmwood Ave, and Allentown. I appreciated the clean and well-stocked kitchen and loved the outdoor porch. As other reviewers noted, extremely narrow shower stall. Was there six nights, got to chat with Ron a few times and otherwise came and went."

Stayed a few nights","The moment I walked into Ron’s place I instantly felt right at home and so comfortable. It’s a great location if you are wanting to explore Buffalo and even get a little bit of the cozy side of the city. Ron was extremely helpful when giving recommendations on places that were must see in the area, and just all around a great host. The only thing we found to be a little challenging was the size of the shower. My boyfriend is 6’2 and about 200 lbs, so he’s a pretty big guy, and he had some trouble moving around in the shower. Personally, I had no issues with the shower (I am 5’4 and 115 pounds). The only reason I say this is to let anyone know, that’s my boyfriends same size, to plan accordingly. This is by NO means a reason to not stay here. Don’t pass up this great opportunity to make memories in Buffalo while also being extremely affordable!"

We like to take public transportation and the location of Ron's place was perfect for our first day in Buffalo. The house is located in a lovely area with older homes and lots of trees. Both Delaware and Elmwood Streets, a short walk from our B&B, had busses to take us to Downtown Buffalo, including Canalside by the river. We also had drinks at the Curtiss Hotel, an historical landmark downtown. We took the time to drive to the Griffis Sculpture Garden, a 45 minute drive from Buffalo, but worth the drive. We also suggest visiting the Frank Lloyd Wright house and gardens. All in all, it was a positive trip and comfortable home."

I appreciated having plenty of closet space to organise ourselves for the stay rather than live out of a suitcase. The only thing that threw me off were the floors as they made me feel like I was just off a rollercoaster at times, but you get used to the grooves after a while :) It’s part of the charm and completely normal for a home in this neighbourhood. I ended up laughing about it by the time we left - only mentioning this in case if someone with low vision or imbalance issues may want to reconsider."

There were a few things holding back on a 5 star rating; there was no salt for the ice on the front stairs. This was a bit dangerous but Felipe did have salt delivered but it was two days of icy front stairs. There was an iron, but no ironing board. This was a bummer as we had a formal occasion. Parking is difficult but they kindly allowed us to use the driveway. Parking on the street was available.

Street parking was easy and typically available right in front of the house. Host was very quick to respond to questions. We did not have any issues, but I feel like if we did, they would have been quickly addressed. We would highly recommend this property and will hopefully stay here again on our next trip to Buffalo!

We didn’t have much time to explore the area, but we did go to the nearby zoo. Though we drove, it was indeed in walking distance. And as advertised, it was only about a 30 minute drive to Niagara Falls. I would definitely recommend this place and will try to stay here again if I ever go back."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is bright and large. Unfortunately, it is directly on the street. It is therefore relatively noisy at night due to traffic. The beds - at least the big and especially the sofa bed - are not so super comfortable.
it was a pity that, for example, there were no pads for the coffee machine. Since there are different coffee machines in almost all AirBnB, you can't be equipped for 1 or 2 nights on a round trip for everyone. The kitchen furnishings are a bit scarce.
Everything else is great."

The location was key, we walked to the Buffalo zoo and to a local coffee shop every morning. A quick 25 minute drive to Niagara Falls and 5 minutes from downtown Buffalo. Highly recommend. Thanks for the great stay!"

Stayed with kids","We very much enjoyed our stay in Filipe's lovely home! Each summer we stay in a different Buffalo neighborhood, and while we enjoyed the vibe of Elmwood Village (where we stayed last year), I preferred staying in Parkside this year. The homes are beautiful and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. And there's plenty within walking distance, without seeming busy or loud. We walked to Hertel one evening (about a 20-minute walk) and spent time at Jam (a 5-min walk away) a couple mornings for breakfast. And of course we visited the zoo and park. The apartment is also close to the 198 and 33 so it was easy to get out of the city if needed. And finally, we're Frank Lloyd Wright superfans so we loved staying so close to the Martin house. Filipe's home is clean and modern, which was a welcome change from the creaky old Airbnb we stayed in last year. We would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in Buffalo!"

We had a very long drive (6 hours) to get to Buffalo, we ended up getting to Buffalo a little earlier than expected, but Filipe was kind enough to let us check in to the house when we arrived. He was very accommodating. Everything was very close to the house and easy to get to. The zoo is just blocks away, as is many great restaurants. We were in town for my son's college graduation, and the weekend ended up being perfect. Thank you again, Filipe, for a wonderful stay!!!!"

The house was private and historical on a lovely and quiet neighborhood street. The house was clean and the comfort of the bed exceeded expectations, rivaling any hotel. Coffee, light refreshments and banana bread in the fridge made us feel like we were staying with family. We will gladly rebook this spot any time we return to Buffalo."

The neighborhood was absolutely adorable with its Victorian styled houses! The place is walking distance to restaurants.
The only down side was that the room had a funky odor that persisted throughout our stay. However, I spoke to Thomas and he was unaware of the problem and apologized for the smell. He is very approachable and he was receptive to the feedback!!
Thank you Thomas for a lovely stay!"

The bathroom is small but with everything you need and the shower is strong and the water is hot. Good air conditioning of the house. I was snowing and thomas cleared the way and even removed the snow from the vehicle. Free parking at the entrance to the house.
As a negative point to say that little kitchenware (plates, glasses, cutlery) and pans in very bad condition.
And most importantly, the dust. The bathroom and kitchen are clean but there is a lot of dust accumulated all around the house. It needs a thorough general maintenance cleaning. My husband and son are allergic and happened regularly."

Thoughtful details included a fresh bucket of ice in the freezer, 4 delicious homemade muffins and some other taste treats.

The apartment is nicely laid out with a quiet bedroom and comfortable living area complete with big screen tv. The kitchen also contains anything you might need (e.g. spices, oil, etc.) if you decide to cook a meal. Thomas very thoughtfully left us some homemade banana bread, as well as coffee, bread, fruit, snacks and soda. We really appreciated the treats after our drive, as well as the coffee and banana bread the next morning. The parking spot in front of the house was very handy. The location in Elmwood Village is convenient, with lots of restaurants nearby. Thomas is a great communicator who made sure we had everything we needed. We look forward to staying here again."

Allentown is a really cool area and the neighborhood was very welcoming. We also visited Niagara Falls, which was a beautiful site. Lots of great food options nearby and nice places to eat. That being said, my only critique would be to stock the bathroom with 2-ply TP rather than single-ply. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely stay here again."

Thomas shared his knowledge of the area, wish we had more time to talk. We were attending a concert at The Key Bank Center, I short Uber ride away, We could even have walked, would take about 30 minutes. You will not be disappointed with the accommodations."

Tom had great local knowledge of the area, restaurants and of the nightly fireworks at Niagra Falls. We saved the best accommodation last, to end our fly drive around New York State. And the home made banana bread was lovely. Would definitely stay here again if we ever return."

Stayed one night","We loved our stay at Thomas's place! The neighborhood is beautiful. The homes have incredible architectural detail and flowers. Thomas's place was behind one of these gorgeous homes so it was quiet and private. The place was squeaky clean -- especially the kitchen and bathroom. Thomas has many local visitor guides and magazines on the bookshelf. And, there was banana bread and cold drinks waiting for us in the fridge. Before we even arrived, Thomas gave us updates about when the place would be ready for check-in and he offered quite a few recommendations of things to see and do in the area. We enjoyed walking the one block to Allentown and walking up Elmwood to Elmwood Village's shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity!"

Stayed one night","It’s easy to see why Thomas has the “super host” rating! Even with a very late-night arrival, he took time to give us a warm greeting and offer some helpful tips/recommendations for the area (as well as some cool local history!).
Everything was exactly as advertised and/or communicated in advance by Thomas.
The homemade banana bread in the fridge was also very tasty!
The cottage has an artsy yet peaceful vibe. And it was so quiet as we enjoyed breakfast on the porch, it was hard to believe we were right in town!
Our dwelling was immaculate too!
It was a little walk back to the cottage from our driveway parking spot, but it was manageable … and the few extra steps were well worth the comfy spot waiting for us!
In closing, one might think with the pricing “it’s too good to be true”, but it’s true - Thomas is truly a first-rate super host!"

You can tell the care that goes into taking care of it. I even found a magazine of best places to go in Buffalo on the coffee table. it was only 5 to 10 minutes from the venue we were going for the concert.

His place was conform to the photos, very quaint & charming in the beautiful historic district of Allentown. It was very well equipped in terms of kitchen utensils, wifi or AC, and the banana muffins were a super nice touch. The only downside is that the place is clearly in need of some deeper cleaning/TLC: all the surfaces were pretty clean but the carpet in the room was very dusty as well as all the AC vents/ window sills, etc. I have asthma and I felt it right away. In general, some updates on the bed/bath linen would also be a plus. It's a good spot to visit Buffalo and the kindness of Thomas is definitely the MVP. Thanks for being such a nice host Thomas."

Thomas was there to meet me upon my arrival and was very friendly and informative to give suggestions to local (all walkable!) restaurants and breakfast spots (Betty's 😋) in the area. The Allentown Historical District is glowing in history and beautiful homes and this home is no exception. The home is stunning and the Airbnb is clean, comfortable and cozy.

Stayed a few nights","Great place, close to downtown and 30 minutes from the falls. No issues with neighborhood.
Only issue we had was the heater, seemed to keep turning on & off and then not staying at desired temp. Not sure what that was about.
The house has an upstairs area where its rented out to a different guest."

Stayed with kids","My husband and I already knew Buffalo Ny, we lived there for 16 years and return after 11 years to visit was super nice, in Harjot's apartment we felt at home, super clean, tidy, comfortable and sparkling, there was a small inconvenience with the second floor tenants too late at night but we communicated with Harjot and quickly fixed it, from 1 to 10 we gave him a 20, surely when he returns again, we would choose to wash with him, we recommend it 100%."
