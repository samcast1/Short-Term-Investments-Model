Stayed with kids","Great location, walkable to many shops and restaurants. Beds and pillows comfortable; we slept great. Plenty of room for our family of 4. The house is old but clean. Appreciated the number of towels provided. Could have used more blankets and another key. Friendly host with the clearest parking and checkin instructions I've ever seen. Would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The location was great! Many restaurants/ bars were walkable. I was a little bit worried that we wouldn’t be able to find an Uber or Lyft to things that were further away, but it was no issue at all! We loved the disobedient distillery and the local Thai place was fantastic. The location is right in the city, and to be expected there is some noise from the street but nothing that takes away from your stay. Darcie was incredibly responsive."

One thing that stood out: I called ahead to let Darcie know the guests were arriving late. She immediately indicated she'd go over to the unit and turn on the lights, so that the place wouldn't be in darkness when they arrived.
This was so thoughtful of her."

It is right downtown and easy to walk to restaurants, etc. Darcie was extremely responsive when we had an issue with the A/C and went above and beyond to help resolve the issue quickly. We all (especially our kids) loved the colorful peacock decor and unique space. The bedrooms were quite large so we had plenty of room for all of us. Thank you, Darcie, for being such a gracious host!"

Stayed one night","I picked Tiffany's place because it's located in the heart of the Indiana, PA, business district and basically across the street from a restaurant where I was having dinner during my stay. I arrived about three hours before check-in and Tiffany was just finishing cleaning and said I could put my stuff inside. That was appreciated.
Tiffany's place has 4 bedrooms on the first floor and two bathrooms. The extra bathroom, with a walk-in shower, was a strong selling point. The choice of bedrooms and bathrooms made me feel a little like Goldilocks with one difference — everything was just right.
Tiffany is friendly and ever so helpful. The beds were comfortable. The AC units worked great. Parking was free in a lot behind the house. As far as accommodations, everything was perfect.
If you're going to Indiana for a homecoming or football game or graduation, I'd steer you to Tiffany without hesitation. And the next time I stay overnight, Tiffany's place will be my first choice."

I would definitely stay here again!"

Tiffany was very responsive and answered all my questions. We will definitely be staying here again when we come to visit our daughter at IUP. Staying at her place was hands down better than any hotel. Was nice not having people stomping above you or kids knocking at your door at 1am and running off. Location was perfect for all we had to do over the weekend. Super clean and had everything you needed and more!!!! Thanks again Tiffany.

However, the bathrooms, living room, and kitchen were hot because the temperatures outside were high during our visit. I am used to AC throughout the house, so that was the only thing I did not like.

The location couldn’t be beat as far as walkability and ease to get to local shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The hosts were very kind and informative but we did have a major issue with the house next door. Apparently it’s student housing and they threw a huge party just feet away from the bedroom windows. It was a pretty restless night even over the window units inability to drown them out."

The kitchen could have been a little bit cleaner and unfortunately the apartment upstairs had a late check in with other guests and it was quite noisy."

(Note: eating out is definitely easier than cooking out of the apartment). I'd definitely recommend that guests have a plan for white noise. We got hit with a particularly loud Saturday night with drunk neighbors. Tiffany is great and is putting in place information to help future guests who encounter this problem. I fully intend to stay here again if/when the opportunity arises!"

Stayed with kids","The location is great with easy access to everything in town. We anticipated more street noise, but we were pleased that it wasn't a concern. The space itself is large and was great for a bigger family to spread out with 4 bedrooms and 2 updated bathrooms. Tiffany was very accommodating and good and quick at communicating with us. Our family is used to quiet, so it was very difficult having an extremely active day and night family above us. It wasn't a level where we felt like we had to leave, but we were glad we brought fans and white noise machines to help drown out the running feet. If you plan on cooking meals, check with the host on what is available. I am sure she would help to provide what was needed."

Group trip","Eight of us girls visited Divinity Inn for a local staycation to just hang out, play cards, and reminisce. We saw the AirBnB photos, but OH MY, it’s even more beautiful in person! A couple of our gals can’t do stairs, and there is a large bedroom on the ground floor with an accessible bath that was perfect for them. The rest of us loved the other rooms so much we didn’t care where we slept! We all spent hours at the huge dining room table playing cards and snacking. We went to Brunzies for dinner our first night. The food was wonderful, and our server was delightful. The next morning was spent at the shops on Philadelphia St. but we couldn’t wait to get back to our beautiful Inn for more gaming. On our last night we walked next door to Benjamin’s restaurant in a gorgeous Victorian home with an “old Hollywood” bar, gazebo, patio, and grape arbor. The food & service were fantastic, and the owner was SO gracious. We’re so in love with Divinity Inn we already rebooked for the Fall"

I stayed 5 nights so got to taste all of it. Sitting at their kitchen table is also a delight; the bird feeders out the bay window and the stream just beyond make it idyllic, heaven on earth, and just what my soul needed. The Spring House is cozy and decorated very cute, with antique and rustic things. It gives it a very homey atmosphere. A comfy bed, too. The setting is bucolic. The beauty of the farm and the animals make is perfect for R&R. I hope I can come back some day. I wil try!"

The hosts were so friendly and communicative and made my stay feel so welcoming. There were nearby restaurants where I was able to order amazing Thai food. I brought a book to read for entertainment and did a lot of walking around during the day. There was a cute tree swing by the pond where I also unwinded while my dog went swimming.

Moire, Randy & Emmie welcomed us into their home & Moire cooked us the most amazing breakfasts with a Scottish influence & was more than happy to cater to our dietary needs. Moire even provided baked us scones to take with us on our early start to attend the Groundhog Day event.
The farm was picturesque with the snow & can only imagine how wonderful it would be during the changing seasons. We would highly recommend this as a place to stay & hope to return again some day."

Stayed with a pet","Morie and her husband Randy could not have been better hosts if they tried. While the accommodations were absolutely wonderful, the breakfasts (we actually stayed with them for four nights) each turned into a lengthy discussion of the benefits of 'farm to table', each other's backgrounds leading to the opening of the B+B, and possible additions to the B+B project such as a five-hole, par three golf venue. Lots of family history with both Moire and Randy centering around sheep, various sheep dogs that have been part of the family, and the originator of the farm, Morie's father - a true Scotsman missing only a grand picture of him in kilt with bagpipes. I know we disrupted Randy's daily schedule in the barn feeding and caring for the sheep, donkeys, horses, chickens, and cats but the no less than two hours each morning chatting with our hosts was priceless. If you would like an escape from the routine of hotel and minimal breakfast - look no further than this B+B - really!!"

Stayed a few nights","I don't even know where to start. The moment we pulled in we felt at home. Greeted by the many animals and the coziest of little homes we could have asked for. She nailed the details of with personal touches, coffee/tea/hot coco assortments and a plate of homemade gingerbread cookies that were to die for. We dropped our stuff on the incredibly comfortable beds and headed outside to explore. We were instantly taken back at the surrounding beauty. Only 3 miles from the town we felt like we were in the middle of nowhere. The horses neighed, the sheep baaaa'd and the kitties meowed... not to mention the chickens. Honestly it was heaven on earth. The hosts were not only very helpful but very kind and accommodating. The homemade, farm fresh breakfast was out of this world and the conversation even better. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone who wants to slow down, have peaceful surroundings, and incredible food. The wifi also worked well for those who want to get some work done!"

A short trek to the top of the hill at the end of the property was worth the effort. I found a beautiful view of surrounding hilltops and farms, and I enjoyed the hawks soaring overhead and across the distant fields.

The Spring House is quite charming; well-appointed, comfortable, clean, spacious yet cozy. The space stayed cool with the ceiling fans and cross-breezes through windows. The bathroom was spotless and the composting toilet had no odor at all, would hardly notice it was not a regular toilet. Shower with great water pressure, beds very comfortable. We enjoyed the opportunity to wander the property and enjoy the beautiful scenery and animals. Moire welcomed us when we arrived and helped us to get oriented to our stay. Our family really enjoyed the tour of the barn and the opportunity to interact with the animals as well. Breakfast was delicious. Convenient location, easy to find, great local restaurants nearby. We would definitely visit again."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough positive things about my stay here!
First the host is wonderful about communicating! The farm is very easy to get to. There is a flat ramp at the spring house and flat ground if you’re staying at the main house, for those having trouble or heavy suitcases.
The spring house was sparkling clean and was decorated absolutely adorable! There were plenty of towels and toiletries, in case you forgot anything. Huge table to make and food at.
The bed was so comfy and after a full day in the country air, I fell asleep in minutes each night!
I would like to add it’s a perfect place for a woman to travel alone. It’s very safe and off the beaten path. Host is on the same property if you need anything! In the spring house you will complete privacy but it’s nice to know someone is close.
I can’t describe how wonderful it was to have my coffee each morning, looking out at the scenery and the animals! So much to see and do if you don’t want to leave yet so close to town, you can have it all here.
I cherished every moment here and I consider the host, her family and the travelers I met there, friends. I will go back again and again. I’m so grateful to have found this slice of paradise!"

We stayed in the private spring house, which was cozy, warm, and inviting. It was beautifully decorated, very clean, and was stocked with everything we needed. We loved the barn and animal tour Emmy gave us (we highly recommend asking her for one when you stay!), and we also recommend taking a felting class with Moire if you’re able to! The location is extremely convenient since it’s only a 5-10 minute drive to all stores and restaurants, yet has the feel of being far from any town or city since the farm is so large. We really enjoyed our time there and hope to return!"

Stayed a few nights","Moire and Randy were great hosts! The spring house was very cute, clean, and cozy. If you’re looking to explore the country a little bit and meet some great locals then I highly recommend staying here. Definitely not the normal “hotel experience” but an even better, more personal experience. I will say the floors in one part of the house are quite cold sometimes so bringing slippers is a good idea, and the toilet is not a normal toilet but a composting toilet (no flushing). That being said if you follow their directions for using the bathroom you will never smell anything.
Also, if you have the chance, definitely get breakfast with them at the main house and chat with their family. They are all extremely nice people and have some great stories. They can also tell you a lot about the history of the farm! Overall an awesome experience… would definitely stay again."

Everything about our stay was absolutely wonderful. Moire and Randy were welcoming, gracious, and kind hosts who were dedicated to ensuring we had the best stay possible. I greatly enjoyed the conversations I had with both Moire and Randy throughout our stay and Moire’s daily breakfast was phenomenal. The spring house was cozy while not cramped, well stocked with necessities, and was quite comfortable - they even set-up a little Christmas tree for us. The wood-burning stove heated the whole space and added to the ambience (there were multiple electric heaters there as well, so you don’t have to use the wood stove for heat if you don’t want to). The composting toilet was easy to adapt to, and there was no odor with the use of the vent fan. The setting of the farm and being surrounded by all the animals provided a serene atmosphere for us to unplug and unwind, yet it is still very convenient to the town of Indiana. Everything about our stay was outstanding and I recommend Burnhead Grazings without hesitation - we very much hope to return to stay again."

Sweet Emmy who also lives there showed us goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, and we were able to see some baby sheep . The breakfast Moire made was exceptional each morning. We ate like a king and queen there. We also had nice conversations in the morning with Moire and her family. Lastly, we enjoyed our walk from the spring house to Moires house. It wasn’t to far from us but far enough we got a small walk in. I suggest trying this place out. We plan to go back again in the future. Thanks Moire and family!"

They helped us clean the snow off our car and from around it with their tractor, and even provided the tools to do so. The wood-burning stove worked perfectly and kept us warm. And, while we were curious what a composting toilet was, as we never experienced it, it actually wasn't so different from what we are used to (and we found it didn't smell at all). Also, Moire was very responses to our calls and questions. Thank you so much!!"

Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that the history behind Burnhead Grazing is so touching and I am happy to be able to support a family continue their legacy of farming and in all their new and wonderful endeavors! Moire herself was such a joy and the location was simply picture perfect. If you want an escape to a farm surrounded by plentiful animals and a wonderful family and a charming little home, book this stay before it is booked up! We will absolutely be returning!"

Stayed one night","I had been in a rough place for the last few weeks and desperately needed some break from work, and am more than happy that I got to stay in Moire’s place for a quick weekend getaway. Moire, Randy, and Emmy are so kind and welcoming that they made me feel like I had already known them before. Listening to Moire’s wonderful stories (which will resonate in me for a long time), walking in the wood with morning sunlight, seeing the farm animals, and having one of the best breakfasts in my life (all the reviews about her breakfast are not exaggerating - she really IS an awesome cook!) made our 4hr-drive worth it. We wish we could have stayed longer! Thank you, Moire, for showing hospitality and being accommodating to the point where you did grocery shopping to find tofu and tried tofu stir-fry for the first time in your life so our vegan friend also had breakfast. It is greatly appreciated!
P.s. The room decor is fantastic & the beds are very comfortable!"

It’s surprisingly close to town but feels very out-of-the-way. Overall a very warm and cozy experience with just a hint of adventure. Highly recommended! Ask about felting classes :)"

There is no waking up to the clamor of city life here, just the gentle conversation among the ewes. Moire served the most scrumptious breakfast- imagine eating fresh scones and homemade jelly, yogurt topped with sweet berries, and then followed up with eggs and sausage sourced from the farm itself. The accommodations are perfectly planned to reflect the history and charm of the setting with comfortable beds and many interesting details to take in. This is a most memorable airbnb choice and Moire’s hospitality is genuine and generous."

There's no TV and no Wifi, but that's part of why we loved it so much. We just sat next to the cozy fire and just visited with each other. In the morning, we would visit the farm house and Moire served us such a delicious breakfast and we got to eat it and watch the stream nearby. Moire and her husband are such welcoming people and it felt like we were home visiting family for the Holidays. The driveway is a little steep and is a little muddy. Our Subaru made it fine, but it's something to note if you're planning on booking the summer home. This trip was one of our favorite AirBnB experiences. Highly recommended if you wanna nice cozy place to unwind and get away from technology."

Moire and husband Randy were super hosts. They welcomed us into their home and treated us like family. They even included us in their family's Thanksgiving dinner.
The stunning property, including a meandering stream and abundant birdwatching, were in full view through Moire's kitchen window, all while enjoying her yummy homemade breakfast only added to the charm, and the pleasant walk over to the barn to visit the farm animals was a bonus.
From the moment I arrived it felt like I was at home and I look forward visiting again."

Roomy with attractive interior and conveniences such as mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker.

Stayed one night","""Discover your perfect retreat in downtown Indiana, PA!"" The description and photos on Airbnb of the home are to the letter but still give no justice to actually experiencing the space.
I accidently booked this location thinking it was minutes away from my cousin's wedding. It was an hour and a half away. Dazed, happy, joyous, sad, grief stricken, and tired were the succession of emotions I exprienced before arriving at Alyssa's Place. Happy accident because I struck gold. It was the perfect respite me and my family needed after a bitter sweet journey to a wedding and saying final farewells to another cousin who was taking his last breaths.
Alyssa and Tyler were very responsive, offered to go above and beyond, friendly, accommodating, gave helpful instructions, and were flexible on my check- in time. The space was absolutely gorgeous and beds slept well. The location had beautiful surroundings, it was very peaceful, and private. This is a must visit retreat location."

Stayed a few nights","I had a good stay overall. The location & amenities available were solid. The apartment in general was good. Unit is remodeled [sinks, appliances, etc.], just a note that unit is not completely renovated. I had no problem buying groceries and storing them. PLENTY of space and storage in my opinion. It was just me but unit is furnished well overall; just missing a Kleenex box and a bulb for the lamp. Roomy enough for 3, just keep in mind the one full bathroom.
It was HOT the two days I was there, so the room air conditioners were challenged keeping the areas cool. That plus other tenants may be the causes for fragrances that emanated a couple times during the day.
All in all, the stay was ideal for me. I appreciated their hospitality and ease with things all in all while there."

The cabin is private, and has a very nice garden, but it is located right off the highway behind a propane company (visible from the front porch, across the manmade pond) and next door to another large house. Outside of this slight misrepresentation, I found the cabin as described, and had a very nice stay."

Just out of the way enough to be private but also you could jump in your car and get groceries or have a night out if you so choose. I will cherish these memories for a long time, worth every penny."

The kitchen was big and inviting and the bathroom was probably the nicest I’ve had on any vacation, especially for a cabin! There wet trails to walk and the pond was great. There was even a family of ducks that were on the pond the whole weekend. My favorite thing was watching my 4 and 5 year old play around the pond while my wife and I just relaxed on the porch. The owner was very responsive and check in/out was a breeze. I found nothing wrong with this place!"

We had a later than expected start which resulted in us reaching Donna’s place pretty late but she was very flexible, friendly, and responsive. There was a “Welcome Whitney” note that brought a huge smile to my face. The space is bigger than expected with a spacious kitchen and spacious bathroom. There’s is a fireplace that makes the place feel nice and cozy, especially early in the morning when my husband got up to fish. Since we got in late, we made the most of the morning by sipping coffee by the fire while reading. My husband went to the pond to practice his fishing before the long drive back. It was a nice little respite for us."

The hosts were very kind and communicated well. We had trouble turning on the gas fireplace and Donna and her husband went over right away and got it working.
Overall, we enjoyed the cabin very much! It was warm and cozy, especially sitting in the living room with the fireplace on. It was great to come back to and relax in the evenings after spending all day at the event. We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Tucked away from the city, but not too far away, is this quaint little cabin that will remind you of the times you spent growing up. A simpler time. Things seldom seen now are like warm hug of nostalgia here. A couch, large enough to accommodate everyone, no TV but a warm snuggly fireplace to gather round and actually talk. Board games rather than computer/phone screens. A table to sit and write or color in a book.
A wonderful place to recharge, reconnect, rediscover, or realign. No matter your path this is truly the place to do it.
Easy access to the road, we heard zero noise from the highway and I’m a very light sleeper. A small man made lake is right in front of the cabin, complete with a beautiful array of domestic ducks, wild birds, and the occasional jumping fish. Lovely farms, country roads, and state Forests 🌳 near by. Less than an hours drive to Pittsburgh, close to local farm fresh eggs, and right up the street from the very good Portia’s Donuts, where they make an EXCELLENT Ube bubble tea. As a chef, I definitely recommend them!
I also thought the service and pancakes were good at Crouse’s."

Stayed a few nights","This cabin was adorable for a glamping experience. The water pressure is decent and the fuzzy blankets were perfect. The air conditioner struggled to keep the small cabin cool, so if you run hot (like my husband) bring a fan or two. I also have very bad allegeries which can be set off by dust, mold, and freshly cut grass. I take meds, but something in the cabin kept irritating my allergies beyond the normal. Just a heads up to others with extreme allergies. Overall it's a cute hunting cabin with all the luxuries home."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our 2 day stay at Curry Run Cabin in early June. The cabin was spotless and comfortable and it was quiet inside -- beautiful wood floors, walls, and cabinets; it had everything we needed / wanted for relaxing, cooking etc. We saw an abundance of wildlife as we sat on the front porch and when walking around the pond -- muskrats, herons, orioles, frogs, a huge turtle, fawns, hummingbirds, fish, white ducks...this made our visit! We got some delicious strawberries etc. at Yarnicks' Farm Market a few miles away (but almost got nailed by traffic as we pulled out onto the highway heading back to the cabin). Hosts Donna and Jan were friendly, welcoming, and responsive; check-in was flawless."

If you’re looking for a place to stay with a wonderful pond and cute fireplace cozy cabin this is your stay. Donna and her husband are wonderful sweet people who have some beautiful land to walk through and enjoy the sound of the birds. John and I will be coming back again in the fall for sure, we love this place and are so glad we found it.

Stayed a few nights","This was our second visit to Curry Run Cabin and the cabin was just a nice and cozy as we remembered it to be from our first visit. We especially enjoyed warming by the fireplace in the evening and looking out at the beautiful view of the pond just in front of the cabin. We did not cook much but, when we did, everything that we needed - and more - was available to us. For anyone who enjoys a walk outdoors, we recommend Blue Spruce park where you can walk entirely around the lake (or, a shorter distance of course if one chooses). For authentic Thai food, prepared by Thai chefs, Thai@Indiana is one of the best Thai restaurants that we have found anywhere. Check-in and check-out was very easy; and Donna and Jan communicated very well when we had questions. My wife and I highly recommend Curry Run Cabin."

It was a cozy, romantic spot for bird watching, a forest walk, even a campfire thought we didn't get to try it. Donna even surprised us by setting up the Christmas tree. It was a very healing spot, curated with beautiful local art and homey touches. Our host was so kind. It was a little hard to find in the dark but her instructions really helped. TV, puzzles, books, and the best view from the little isle on the pond of all the birds made this a perfect place to slow down, reconnect and appreciate the good things. Good recommendations for local finds, and a nice sized bed, but we ended up on the bunk beds because my back likes a firmer mattress. I slept so soundly. Check out was a breeze! It was so nice to read the lovely notes from prior travelers. Donna goes the extra mile and it shows. We are both grateful and look forward to our next staycation!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful anniversary and early Thanksgiving with our kids at Curry Run. We've used airbnb to find several cabins and this one might be our favorite so far.
The location is perfect - relatively secluded and close to many beautiful parks and trails, yet the drive to Aldi/Walmart is super quick and easy. The pond is lovely, I love the fire pit option, and the cabin itself is so comfy and cozy. Having a toddler with us, I really appreciated that the furnishings and decor were sort of minimal/non-cluttered but it didn't feel like it was lacking anything either.
And if that weren't enough to seal the deal, Donna and Tim were so gracious and attentive. We will definitely be back if we have the chance."

The only place to eat was around a counter in the kitchen with uncomfortable stools that are too tall in relationship to the counter. No good place to play cards or game. Smoke alarm was removed and laying in the kitchen with a dead 9v battery beside it; other smoke detectors missing or malfunctioning. The entrance way and steps leading from the front door is dingy and smells of mildew. Not where in second bedroom to hang clothing. Host makes a good attempt at hospitality but apartment works against her.

It was Folk Festival on Philadelphia St and we had a view overlooking the band. Everything was in walking distance. We had dinner in on Saturday night and had everything we needed in kitchen.

Stayed with kids","Great location just off Philadelphia Street. We arrived at night, in poor weather, so it was a little bit harder to locate the parking lot but the host provided good directions. Were it not for the blizzard and sub zero temperatures it would have been a great place to walk to restaurants and shops. The building is old but the heater worked well and we stayed cozy during inclement weather. Kitchen is well stocked with everything you will need and the unit was extremely clean. The only thing to note is since one of the bedrooms does look out on Philly Street, you get a bit of bar noise in the middle of the night so if you are a light sleeper you will probably want to claim the back bedroom. Overall it was a great find and we enjoyed our stay, we will definitely check to see if the unit is available the next time we travel to Indiana."

Randy gave us an unforgettable tour of the barn where we got to see and hear many lambs and sheep as well as horses, a donkey, and two barn cats.
Moire and Randy were very accommodating to our uncommon schedule and needs. We appreciated the comfortable bed, the spotless environment, the tasty and bountiful breakfast, the handicapped bars in the bathtub/shower, and the friendliness of the hosts."

Stayed a few nights","Words do not do justice to the beauty of this BnB - but I will try.
The fields surrounding the house provide a comfortable level of isolation - even though there are many amenities within just a couple miles.
There are so many places to walk, benches and chairs to sit on, and things to see. I found myself relaxing on the back porch catching up on a little light work - all the while distracted by the small wildlife living their lives as if I wasn't there. No sounds of humanity - just the gurgling stream, and birds chirping.
Later on, near sunset, I walked over to the pond and watched the bluegills and bass drinking in the last rays. I sat in an Adirondack chair and watched the sun dip behind the trees.
Moire and Randy are just as pleasant as the surroundings. To say that they are gracious hosts would be an understatement. Quinn the Corgi was a joy to entertain!
I hope to find the time to come back for a longer visit in the next couple of months."

The conversation at breakfast was equally wonderful, with Moire and Randy and two visiting pals. It isn’t often you get to engage in a complex conversation with strangers. And what a pleasure it was.

We especially appreciated that she offered us our choice of the Queen Room in the family home and the Upper Room in the Spring House, since both were available. We stayed in the Spring House, a cozy, delightful cottage just down the stream from the family home. It was beautifully decorated, warm and comfortable, and peaceful throughout the day and evening. Other highlights were the wonderful conversations with Moire, Randy and Emmy throughout our stay, the phenomenal breakfasts, and delightful interactions with the animals on the farm. Indiana also has several fantastic restaurants and shops that are not to be missed! We are planning to come back with our 2 children sometime in the near future.

Stayed one night","When planning for year 3 of The Veterans Half-Marathon in Indiana, PA, my wife and I try to stay overnight locally since we reside close to two hours away. All hotels were booked this year so we opted to try an Air B&B. What we found was so much more than a place to sleep and shower. What we found were excellent people who love others like family and accommodations that were second to none. From the very comfortable bed, to the immaculately cleaned bathroom, and the gourmet breakfast that powered me through 13.1 miles of early November heat( yes, it was in the mid 70’s and 80% humidity that day), we felt like we were the most important people in Moire’s and Randy’s lives. My biggest regret is not having more time to spend at their charming farm, I would have loved to see the rest of the property and the barn and livestock. Therefore, we will be scheduling another trip to Indiana to spend additional time getting to know Moire and Randy’s estate more intimately. Sometimes you just meet people that make you feel like you’ve known each other all your lives, that’s Moire and Randy."

Stayed one night","Lovely - When I first arrived, I thought, Wow. The setting is the best part of this place; but then I met Moire and her family, and had breakfast, and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings.. I don't know if I can pick the best part.
So... to try to write the kind of review I would like to read... The setting is idyllic. Beautiful - and not far from civilization while still being peaceful and private. That being said, there are hills, and rocks, and country things - pets, crickets chirping, fireflies glowing, frogs croaking - if that's your idea of heaven, you are in luck, but if not, this may not be the place for you.
If you have difficulty with steps, there are two to get in to the house. Once you are in, there are no steps (although I did not go out on the back porch or deck, so there may have been some there.
The bedroom is cozy, and you truly could come in with just your clothing - everything you need has been provided. If you are a larger person, the space between the end of the bed and the wall is narrow, but there is a very comfy chair to sit in and an office chair with a place to work. There were plenty of blankets and pillows. Note that your bedroom is down the hall with all of the bedrooms, and, while you have a bathroom to yourself it is not connected to your bedroom - you will walk just a few feet down the hall to get to it.
The common area is comfy and, truly, you will feel as if you have gone to stay with your favorite aunt.
Breakfast was wonderful. On the day we were there, we had fresh fruit, yogurt, potatoes, eggs, sausage, juice, coffee (and tea if we wanted). Everything was very good - and farm fresh.
Before we left, we were sure to get a tour of the farm - and got to meet the animals.
If you want a peaceful country setting, this is your place! I loved my stay with Moire, and would have loved to stay longer."

Moire and Randy were excellent hosts, accommodating anything we needed - even packing us a to-go breakfast for our early morning departure on Groundhog Day!
An added bonus was the unique experience of being taken on a tour of the barn and getting to be up close and personal with the sheep, donkeys, horses, and chickens!"

It is also conveniently located by multiple restaurants, microbreweries and other shops in Indiana PA. If you are looking to get away this is a lovely place to go.

It’s nice to enjoy nature as it’s intended and learn new things about sheep and farming, with good conversation with good people. Beautiful scenery as you can swing on a tree swing and watch the sun set, and sit in the breakfast nook in the morning and eat with the birds and other visitors. Definitely a trip worth taking and experiencing. I hope to return."

She gives you as much space as you'd like while still being available to provide suggestions for meals and things to do locally, or just to enjoy a nice conversation. During my stay, Moire asked if I'd like to tag along for morning chores at the barn which was a treat, and she even shared a demonstration of wool felting for a project she was working on! There are lots of comfy places to read or sit outside, as well as the gorgeous property to walk along and reconnect with nature. The breakfasts were all delicious as well. I feel well-rested and rejuvenated after my stay with Moire at Burnhead Grazings and am looking forward to a return visit in the future!"

Moire shared her story with us, about how her father bought the farm to raise sheep and Australian sheepdogs. We shared horse experiences and saw the barn, horses, minature horses, goats, sheep and chickens. The whole family was very friendly and positive; they went the extra mile in every way. Breakfast was spectacular - 5-star restaurant worthy. It was a very relaxing and restorative time - just perfect. I will be coming back again and again."

Stayed a few nights","Escape for a spell by crossing into Burnhead Grazings and experience this hidden oasis of simplicity. Wake to daily gourmet breakfasts served piping hot. Stroll the property and allow yourself to loose track of time. Watch the miríade of birds as the fly, feed and chirp along the babbling stream. Sit by the lake as the dusk approaches, sip your coffee and feed the fish as they swim to greet you. Visit with the sheep, lamb, donkeys, chickens, goats and horses and be one with the energy and warmth you feel around you. Just walk, breathe, relax and be. If you’re looking to unplug and recharge, there is no better place to visit. Moire is the ultimate hostess, artist and chef. Absolutely amazing!

Moire made us feel right at home, making sure we were comfortable and made us an outstanding farm-style breakfast. And given COVID, she was very cautious and respectful of our wishes to keep safe distance.

My husband and I needed to take a weekend away from the stress of living in the city and staying at this sheep farm did just the trick! Moire and her family go above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome with a real PASSION for hospitality. The day starts with a DELICIOUS farm fresh breakfast. I am still thinking about her fresh scones! She welcomes you to observe her daily farming chores and invites you to explore her land as you please. We spent a lot of our time relaxing on a tree swing and laying in the grass reconnecting with nature, or cuddling up with her pup Brig and cat Pip, which was a dream. She also offers excellent tips on local restaurants, shops, and hiking trails so, there was never a moment of confusion on how to plan our day. Local parks, trails, and nightlife were only minutes away. Also, her home is spotless and charming! I cannot say enough good things about our visit and I hope to return sometime soon!"

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I came to “Burnhead Grazings” Indiana, PA for “Groundhog Day”. We have been to many Airbnb’s but this one was supreme and by far the very best!! Moire made us feel like family from the moment we stepped into her home. The setting was idyllic with the rolling hils and grazing sheep, along with the warm and inviting home, especially the wonderful fire in the cozy sitting room, where we sat on that cold first evening with a glass of wine, getting to know our hostess and all about the surrounding area. It was a perfect beginning. Getting to accompany Moire, as she tended to her evening chores, feeding her sheep, miniature donkeys and chickens was a special treat! Moire is an excellent cook and the delicious breakfasts she served each morning were sublime! It was also a pleasure to chat with Moire’s husband, Randy each morning before he left for work Moire packed all of her “Groundhog Day” guests a delicious breakfast and gave us warm woolen blankets, as we headed off at 4am to see “Phil.” During our stay, we checked out the “Jimmy Stewart Museum” in downtown Indiana and each of the restaurants that Moire recommended . . . Superb! I could go on and on about the pleasure we had, while staying at Moire and Randy’s home but the best way to understand is to take a trip to the delightful little town of Indiana, Pa. and then drive out into the beautiful countryside for a little slice of heaven at “Burnhead Grazings “. You will not be disappointed. We will be back again, Theressa and Stan"

Group trip","The setting of the house is incredible....very secluded and surrounded by beautiful trees. Lots of big windows to help appreciate the outdoors from inside. The common area was very comfortable and had plenty of room for six adults. The kitchen was well-equipped and had everything we needed; we did not use the kitchen on the lower level. There is a newish covered gazebo-type structure outside the house that provides a wonderful immersion in the surrounding nature. We had no trouble going up or down the driveway...it's a typical dirt drive.
Be aware that there are only two ""enclosed"" bedrooms, one on the main level and one on the lower level. In addition, there is a queen bed in the open loft upstairs...a beautiful room but no blinds or curtains to keep out the early morning sunrises. There is also a bed in the common room on the lower level; it is open to the downstairs kitchen but has a curtain that provides some privacy from the common area.
All in all, we had a wonderful stay."

Stayed a few nights","The house is beautiful! It is very well equipped and extremely clean. The view is lovely. The downside is the trip up the driveway, it was more daunting than we expected. The host tried to make it clear in the welcome instructions but it was still more than we expected, we made it though. However, we did end up leaving one day early since there was rain expected and we were concerned with traversing the driveway after rains. There was also an issue with sulfur smell in the home, airing it out helped and it was noted that they have random issues with it in the house info left for us. Communication with our host, Greg, was good and he reimbursed us some of the cost due to the need to leave early, which was much appreciated. He also told us that they are scheduling with contractors to work on the driveway. If that can be smoothed out a bit and the sulfur remediated or house vented in some way, it would be a perfect spot. If you have 4WD or high profile vehicle you would have no issues. It is a beautiful place to stay, once you get up the drive :)"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first trip in two years, and it was a very good start. The house and view are gorgeous.
The exterior pictures on the Airbnb page haven't been framed to avoid eyesores, there aren't any. The long steep driveway means that no other houses are nearby. The house is near the edge of grass clearing surrounded by trees. I don't even remember seeing a power line, which I guess means it is buried. On the other side of the house the hill slopes down giving a view. From the entrance floor you can see the ridge top across the valley. A few radio towers are the main sign of civilization. From the top floor you can see down into the valley, with fields and route 422. The house has lots of big windows to see in all directions.
I like the interior decoration. For many homes pictured on Airbnb, I think, well, that would do. This place is more to my taste. (Other than a few deer heads.) You can judge for yourself, the Airbnb pictures are representative.
The wifi was good enough for FaceTime calls, throughout the house, so I could show off the place with a quick virtual tour. The Verizon and T-Mobile reception seemed fine. (Except for an old Verizon phone that hasn't been upgraded yet. The 3G network seems to be already mostly gone here. It will be gone everywhere in a few months.) There are plenty of electric outlets.
The air conditioner is indeed loud, but opening some windows was a better option when we were there. Be aware that one window in the loft doesn't have a screen. I didn't notice, letting in a large wasp. Luckily it didn't take long to get it back out. I didn't see any other indoor wildlife.
The foyer with its outside and inside doors was useful for unloading and loading our car, without risking letting in bugs.
Indiana PA is less than ten miles away, and big enough to have the usual stores.
We explored a little bit of the Ghost Town Trail and the Hoodlebug Trail. But there is much more to do in the area, so it would be nice to come back for a longer stay."

Though there was a warning about the road, I didn't find it to be difficult. Finally, remember this is a rural property and anything next to the woods, especially in Spring, might have a mouse or two. It says nothing about the property which was well maintained. You might want to keep on scrolling if the reality of country living would be too anxiety provoking."

Group trip","This is a beautiful place to stay while in Indiana, PA. It is not far away from the actual town to get groceries, etc. The home was clean and spacious. The location is very private, and there is a long steep hill to drive up. The hill is a dirt country lane, but we had no trouble getting to the home even in the rain. This is a location that I would recommend and would likely return to if I am ever in the area."

Stayed with kids","We have stayed in this house several times in the past couple of years because it’s a convenient halfway point to meet out-of-state family. The fact that we keep coming back should be testament that this is a quality stay. The views are gorgeous, the house is spacious and well kept, and the owners are friendly and communicate well. We always see wildlife and appreciate the short trails in the woods. There are several quirks to the house including the water system and the incredibly loud AC unit, the driveway is a beast, and the basement has a distinctive odor that’s distracting but not a dealbreaker for us. Overall, we are likely to come back and would certainly recommend it. It’s a nice house in a beautiful, secluded location."

The house itself was beautiful and had amazing light with lots of windows. The property was remote but close enough to everything we needed it wasn’t a hassle. The area around the house was very private and had gorgeous trails and open green space. Everything was meticulously labeled and organized and perfect for our stay. Communication with Greg was easy and his detailed instructions were easy to understand and made getting to the house a breeze. We really enjoyed our time at Highpoint and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, relaxing, and very safe retreat."

Stayed one night","I don’t know where to start in this review; to sum it up, I highly recommend Greg’s place for your stay. I booked this place in January of 2020 for a surprise engagement with my soon-to-be fiancé. Greg was in on the surprise the whole time and was very responsive to my thousand different questions. Unfortunately I had to move my reservation from the original date in April due to Covid, and Greg was so easy to work with the rescheduling. When we arrived in May, the place was immaculate. The views were amazing, and there wasn’t anyone around to intrude on our moment. I couldn’t have asked for a better location for an engagement, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking along those lines or for any other large or small event. This was my first time staying at an Air Bnb, and I think it’ll be a challenge for any future hosts to top the experience Greg gave us."

The only thing I would note was that the driveway was a little steeper and rougher terrain than we expected. We had no problem getting our vehicles up there. But we ended up not ordering an Uber because we feared the Uber wouldn't come up the driveway. Perhaps Uber has gone up in the past, and it would have with no problem. We just decided to drive ourselves to our destination. Overall, I would gladly stay here again."

There is a fully equipped kitchen and ample space to cook. We did have some communication issues with the host, but it was our fault and did not know the house rules would be so strict. We were there for a wrestling tournament and had invited the team that was staying at nearby hotels for dinners at the house. We didn't know you had to be a registered guest to be in the home. We talked to Greg after the visit and he was very approachable and worked with us to reach an understanding. He was also very generous and sent us belongings that were left in the home. Overall, a good experience."

Stayed one night","Overall a great place to stay - responsive, helpful hosts; clean; has everything you need (linens, towels, shampoo/conditioner, soap, hair dryer, etc. - just like a hotel); and beautiful, beautiful setting. A few things to consider as you decide where to stay: 1) This property has 4 very comfortable sleeping areas, but none are fully enclosed. Also, all 4 are full of windows and very bright during the day. So, if you are traveling with toddlers or babies, it can be a bit challenging to find a secluded spot for them that will be conducive to napping and noise control. 2) This property is at the end of a steep, gravel driveway - if you are traveling in winter and expecting snow or ice, I would take this into consideration before booking again since I don't have an all-wheel or 4-wheel drive car (to be fair, neither did the host, so it may be entirely do-able to get up there in the snow, but its something I would talk to them about). As I said, however, overall a great experience and I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The was a wonderful Airbnb experience. The house was fantastic, on the top of a small hill with views all around. We enjoyed the large windows, large living space and well equipped kitchen. Communication with Greg was excellent. It was ideal for a mini family gathering halfway between NYC and Michigan."

Stayed one night","This was a lovely oasis for our family of four! Views were spectacular and it was much more spacious than anticipated. Although we spent little time there as we were in the area for a major fast pitch softball tournament for our daughter, it was a perfect place to make meals and relax between the 5 games she played in 24 hours. Clean and had everything we needed - including the washer and dryer. Would love to return, perhaps soon! Thanks again to Greg and his sister, Jennifer - both were responsive and the hospitality was wonderful!"

Stayed one night","I stayed in the three level wilderness guest house along with a group of 7 other people prior to a graduation ceremony at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP). The home was beautiful, peaceful and cozy! It's also literally 10-15 minutes away from IUP's campus. The hosts, Greg and Jennifer, were extremely helpful and accommodating. A member of our group accidentally broke a lamp in the living room during our stay; when I informed Jennifer, she told us not to worry about it and to enjoy our day! :-) How gracious of her?! Needless to say, I would highly recommend this home to anyone!"

Stayed a few nights","Great little getaway on a private hilltop. This place was spectacular. Upon our arrival we were informed that there was a fresh jug of milk in the fridge and coffee in the cabinet for us. The family that owns it Greg, Jen, and Doug were absolutely fantastic to deal with. Unfortunately we were there for work and didn't really get to enjoy all relaxing elements of this place, however the steam shower was great after some long days at work. Don't let the fact that there is well water scare you. Unlike most places with well water you won't even know the difference it's that good. I Will definitely be back to relax. Thanks again Greg, Jen, & Doug."

Group trip","This house is cozy and a nice place to stay with the family for the weekend. There is 1 king, 1 queen, 2 full and 1 twin size bed. the upstairs room is super cute my daughter loved it up there. Tiffany responds quickly when messaging. She had everything we needed to make dinner for a night. The only downside to staying here is parking. You have to park in the back of the house on the other side of the backyard, so you have to walk through the grass to get to the house. when we got there it was wet and raining a little so the only shoes I brought were soaked before we even got inside. I wouldn't let this stop me from staying again but I would bring a different pair of shoes to walk in the wet grass. Overall it was a good stay."

Stayed with kids","I came into town for one night to visit family and to celebrate my grandmother's 99th birthday. After looking for a decent hotel with adjoining rooms for my family and I, I realized that it was going to be almost $300 for two hotel rooms. I decided to check to see if there were any smaller airbnbs that were priced better and came across this home. I wasn't looking for 5 star accommodations just some place that had enough beds and bedrooms for my family and I. This was the perfect little place just outside of town and worked for everything that we needed. well definitely keep it as an option next time I'm in town to visit!"

Some things to note, we had relatives over for dinner and the kitchen was not stocked with much to be able to cook and eat at the house. If you are planning on eating most of your meals out this won’t be an issue but if you want to be able to eat in, you may need to bring your own cooking supplies."

The house was very clean and quite cozy, and although we didn't have a house full of kids, the upstairs area would be perfect for families traveling together and giving kids and adults their separate spaces. We would definitely stay here again."
