This trip I went to Rough Draft for a matcha (and three books!), Le Canard for a Negroni and their mussels special, Sissy’s for lunch, all walkable, and hit up Red Owl Collective on my way out of town."

The location is great with it being only a 6 minute walk to a great restaurants and the heart of the historic downtown. There was even a slow EV charger at a nearby parking lot. The home was comfortable, clean, nicely furnished with a simple clean aesthetic. Kaz was super responsive and even reached out to us to say that we could check in early. He was also upfront and honest about the upstairs neighbor’s noisy dog but provided ear plugs in case it was a disturbance."

Shower and bed were good, apartment was basically spotless. If you are a light sleeper, you should be aware we had a hard time staying asleep after being awoken throughout most nights from neighbor/dog above. The floors are thin and you will hear the footwork. With earplugs recommended for sleep, it is a wonderful place to stay otherwise."

Stayed a few nights","I rented this for an 80+ year old family member who visited us over the holidays and wanted their own private space to retreat to at the end of their day. The host was very gracious and friendly. They proactively checked in on the temperature of the room when my relative arrived (it can not be controlled from the rental area), which was great because we had just been hit with an ice storm. They also had the stairs in front of the house shoveled and salted before we arrived. It was really a good set up for my relative - easy to get around, but I did need to escort them up the front stairs because they were pretty steep. The rental came with more amenities than we had expected, which was a nice surprise. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone visiting the Kingston area who wants to be in a casual place and within walking distance of some great restaurants, shops and entertainment."

Interior furnishings were of a modern interior design, and in lovely Victorian building with plenty of greenery for those while love plants. Other deets:
-big a/c unit to beat the heat and sleep in the cold
-huge super comfy bed with big tv placed in front of it, just like you’re at a hotel
-nice big kitchen with appliances, pots, pans, utensils
-a few cute little surprises to truly make you feel welcome.
-great water pressure in the shower too (honestly!)

The kitchen is fully stocked and we spent a lot of time on the breezy front porch (the neighbours are lovely too!). We stayed in June and the portable AC unit was perfect to stay cool.

They have thought of everything. So much so, that I was taking notes of things to add in my own rental. It was clean, well decorated and in a wonderful location. Being able to wake up and be at Rough Draft Bar and Books in 2 minutes for coffee was a highlight. I would absolutely stay in this vintage charmer again!"

Stayed a few nights","Kaz and Nat’s apartment “Guesthouse” is on the first floor of a house that’s easy walking distance from a quaint restaurant and shopping area of Kingston. It’s plenty roomy for two, and eclectically decorated. While the bed is a bit lower than comfortable for a tall sexagenarian, it was very comfy, maybe too much so in the morning:) Plenty of good suggestions for destinations and food, both nearby and in the larger area. The apt has the coolest floor-level night lights I’ve ever seen, though the kitchen could use a lighting upgrade, if you intend to prep food or plan your trip in that spot. Most o the fixtures are original to the house era, but plenty of new touches in the place. Easy parking spot next to the porch stairs, valuable in the neighbohood."

Our gracious hosts provided us with all the information we needed and went way beyond to make our long weekend comfortable and memorable. The guesthouse is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs, including delicious teas!
The bed is comfortable, bathroom and outside terrace with rocking chair are excellent. The guesthouse is sparkling clean, unique and very quiet.
The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures.
The neighborhood is very conveniently located, we loved the book-coffee shop few steps down the street.
Would totally recommend to stay there!"

We appreciated all of the personal touches and amenities they provided to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. Kaz also sent us many recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to try in the area. The location was perfect for walking to many of these sites and local eateries. Parking was made available in their driveway, which was appreciated as parking spots were limited on the street. The check-in procedure was clearly described; we had no problems accessing the guest house, and we also felt safe due to the double-entry system, both with electronic locks requiring codes to enter. Overall, we had a great experience staying at Kaz and Nat's property!"

It was my first time visiting this city in upstate New York. Kaz was so kind to let me check in at noon and get ready for a wedding rehearsal at the nearby Old Dutch Church. My partner and I slept so well our first night, the mattress was incredibly comfortable and the shower pressure was hot and consistent.
The space was SO CLEAN and organized!! It snowed on our last night and the following morning Kaz and Nat shoveled snow off the driveway. Both of them were kind and gave me a big jar of local honey ❤️ I would absolutely stay here again. Thank you so much Kaz and Nat for your gracious hopistality 😊"

Stayed a few nights","Great Airbnb in an amazing location in Kingston. Just a few blocks' walk to Rough Draft (an incredible bookstore/bar) and all of the restaurants, bars, shops, etc. in the historic part of town. The hosts are also great - very responsive and communicative, and they even brought us umbrellas when an unexpected rainstorm blew in! The one downside is that the apartment is a bottom-floor unit, so you do get noise from the upstairs neighbors walking around. This wasn't anything crazy, but might not be ideal for any light sleepers out there. Overall though we loved both the unit and the location, and would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Kaz's place was the best! The studio-style apartment, on the ground floor of a two-floor house in Uptown, was everything we needed, hoped for, and more. It's a five-minute walk (in a very walkable neighborhood!) to all of the restaurants, bars, cafes, and stores of Uptown, Kingston, not to mention the farmers market on Saturdays. The best thing about staying at Kaz's was how comfortable and aesthetically pleasing the space was - the decor and all the little touches (like a few snacks which were there upon our arrival) made it feel luxurious and homey at the same time. Kaz is right that some noise does travel between floors, so we could hear the upstairs neighbor watching tv and moving about at times during the evening, but it didn't bother us too much during our stay, and was totally expected in an older building : ) This place is such a wonderful deal for the area, and we will definitely look to stay at Kaz's again the next time we are in Kingston!"

There is ample street parking as well, and the street is very quiet and peaceful (great if you’re looking for a relaxing getaway).

We loved all the beautiful plants in the apartment, and even though it was one of the coldest weekends all winter, they had the heater kicking to keep us nice and warm. We will stay with them again for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Kaz and Nat’s place is clean, warm, and cozy. Located just a block or two from the historic Stockade/Uptown district, my husband and I enjoyed strolling through the old district with its cafes and quaint shops, and visiting old historic buildings and houses. Also, the Rondout is just a short drive from their place. Even with the Covid restrictions in place and not seeing our hosts in person, Kaz and Nat made us feel welcome with the little touches they left for us. They are responsive to texts and messages as well. If we find ourselves in Kingston again, we would stay with them."

Stayed a few nights","I will try to keep this short and sweet because there are so many wonderful things I can say about this humble abode. From the moment you walk through the door you are greeted with sunlight in the living room with an open area connected to the bedroom. Trust me, the pictures that you see, don't do the home justice. Everything in the home was well tidy and clean and you can just tell that you're going to enjoy your stay. This house is in the perfect location of walking distance to great coffee shops. Uptown coffee and Outdated Antiques Cafe were our favorites. PAKT is a little pricey but they have the best chicken and waffles I've had in a while. For dinner, I recommend La Florentina (6 min drive) and Vincenzos Pizzaria & Ristorante walking distance of the home. Lastly, on the last day we had forgotten our bag. Both Kaz & Nat were so courteous that sent it back to us which i can't thank enough for! This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had thus far and would definitely come back if we came back to Kingston, no questions asked! Thank you Kaz & Nat for having such a beautiful home and allowing us to stay. Happy New Year!"

The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a meal. We stayed over Christmas so the local shops were closed, but the apartment was in a great location to go out and walk into town.

Stayed a few nights","Kaz and Nat's place was awesome! Perfect location, easy walking to all uptown Kingston and convenient jumping off point for exploring the rest of the region. And if you needed suggestions, Kat and Naz shared a nice list of things to do/eat/see! The apartment felt spacious and very clean, and they left snacks for us to boot. My only complaint would be that I was woken up by the upstairs neighbor at 5am each morning. Alas, not much to be done about me being a light sleeper and they being an early riser in an old building... but just a note for fellow sensitive sleepers. (In all fairness, my partner slept through all of this and the bed is quite comfortable). Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place. Kaz and Nat were very thoughtful and communicative and we had a great time."

The space itself is thoughtfully designed and emits the feeling of pure tranquility, zen and relaxing introspection. I spent my few days exploring on my own and staying here on my downtime and honestly this apartment was the highlight of my trip. The kitchen is ready to use to make coffee, tea cook and what not. The bed was so comfortable and the desk on the corner was a thoughtful to UK ch for people who need a desk pace to brain storm and create. The living room space was a quiant zone. The books and knowledge surrounding me gave a feeling of curiosity to learn and explore more. Everything seemed to be at a perfect balance because of this space. It showed me the importance of having a calm, welcoming place to return to every evening. Truly thoughtful and enlightened space."

Not to mention it smelled really clean and fresh all throughout. The location was perfect and we were walking distance from everything in town. It’s also a short drive from lots of great hiking spots! The only thing that was kind of a bummer was the fact that so few places in town were open. I’m not sure if it’s because of COVID or if it’s just an off season for Kingston. Not any fault of these great hosts of course, but just something worth noting for those who might be expecting a more lively neighborhood when they visit."

Stayed over a week","This gonna be the most extended review I’ve ever written before because I looooove this place as well as the hosts Kaz and Nat! You can treat this review as a love letter to them and their lovely apartment! I moved from the city to Kingston and stayed at their place for 2 months. This place is too good to be true!
Communication: the communication with Kaz and Nat was very smooth and easy. They replied to me within 10 min, even though I contacted them around midnight. They addressed all my concerns and answered all my questions. They even send me pictures of the parking sign to me before I arrived.
Price: the price is super reasonable! There are many Airbnb in this neighborhood, but this one has the best price. Kaz told me he wants to set a price which he would like to stay as a customer himself.
Location: great location! It’s a quiet residential area, but close to everything! 10-minute walk to supermarket, gym, laundromat, different restaurants, coffee shops, farmer’s market (open on Saturday morning during summertime), and bank.
Apartment: It’s a very tidy and lovely studio equipped with everything you need. They have different kinds of tea and coffee available. Water, saltzer, and even kombucha are available in fridge. The place is very clean; even the sink strainer is spotless. Kaz and Nat have great taste in terms of decoration! You can tell from the details how much effort they have put in this place. There are multiple pieces of furniture made by hosts themselves (amazing!). The bed, like many comments mentioned, is the comfiest ever!
Parking: free street parking with many available spots, but you need to change side of the street following the parking sign day-by-day. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are one side; Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday are the other side of the street.
Host: I can’t say enough about them. They always try their best to help me and respond to all of the requests very quickly! I came to Kingston without knowing anyone here, but they make me feel I’m home.
Stay at this place!! You will like it for sure!"

When I got the airbnb, it was a little chilly and they immediately turned the heat up for me. I asked for an early check-in and late check-out and it was accommodated so easily!

One minor disappointment was that I think they forgot to restock the coffee. I read rave reviews about the coffee, and so I didn’t throw any in my bag. They have a beautiful pour-over setup and I was sad that I couldn’t use it 😂 A “first world problem” for sure. Luckily, there are some great coffee shops nearby, and I started my day with some nice caffeinated tea at the apartment for a change."

Stayed a few nights",Such a cute place! Had everything I needed for me stay and is in a great location. It looked exactly like the photos and was very clean. A cute little snacks plate was also provided (all of my favorite snacks coincidentally!) The only downside is that I didn’t stay very long. I’d definitely want to come back for a longer stay in the future!

This space is impeccably and artfully designed and curated. Every inch was filled with something beautiful. The bed was super comfy. The array of delicious teas was vast. The town is super cute, quaint, and easily walkable. And the hosts are fabulous in their communication. Thank you!"

The carefully selected ceramic collection for drinking coffee/tea is a touch that goes the extra mile. Location was great to explore Kingston (as well as free parking). The hosts were also very responsive if anything was needed. Price was a bit of a splurge for us for just one night, but it really was a wonderful space and we hope to return someday!"

host was super easy to communicate with
accepted my last minute request within minutes
and had no problem with me checking in a little bit late in the evening.
The house is well lit from the outside and in a very clean and safe area.
Location is superb you are in walking distance of everything!
thoughtful touches throughout the apartment which I found to be extremely spacious well lit and spotless.
The bed was super comfortable The hosts left a very thoughtful bowl of snacks on the table which was much needed since I had worked the entire day made a last minute decision to head up and hadn't eaten at all .
Extremely tastefully decorated.
the house itself is large and colorful and has a few apartments within but I didn't hear anyone
no one above me and no one next to me! Well insulated. at one point I was fantasizing that I lived there.
Do yourself a favor, book more than two nights you're not going to want to leave!"

Also had the pleasure of meeting Atsuko and Satoru one afternoon going into the house and they are a lovely and attentive couple!

It is the perfect location in uptown, Kingston. It is quiet yet near to wonderful shops, restaurants and beautiful old churches. It is private yet centrally located.
The appliances are top of the line. The kitchen is fully appointed and there are many thoughtful touches, with snacks and ample tea and coffee selection.
There is a parking space and laundry facilities.
Atsuko and Satoru are totally accessible, gracious and very generous hosts.

Stayed a few nights","This was our second trip to Kingston and we loved it more this time because we stayed in Uptown Kingston, which is really the place to be. This apartment was in the heart of upstate, walking distance (3 to 6 minutes) from everything, and only a 20 min drive to Rheinbeck, across the Hudson. The apartment was not only squeaky clean, and beautifully decorated, but there were also many small details that made it extra special: as a tea drinker, I really appreciated the great assortment of teas and honey (usually, I always have to buy or bring my own), they also had great drip coffee, which my husband enjoyed. The master bed was amazingly comfortable and cozy, and the living room was equipped with Roku television. This was a trip for pleasure but we made note of the desks in each of the rooms which will come in handy when we return to work remotely from Kingston! All in all, we had a great time, and recommend Atsuko and Saturo’s properties to all. We will certainly rent from them again!"

Stayed a few nights","Second time staying at Atsuko and Satoru's Airbnb. They have a couple of units and each of them have been great. They are thoughtfully decorated, while still remaining free of clutter. The space was clean, as described and in an unbeatable location. I loved the privacy additions to the windows given that the buildings are closer together - there was still so much sunlight coming through into the apt! They are kind and accommodating hosts. I'd definitely recommend staying at any of their units."

Stayed one night","This was a beautiful apartment with lots of character and antique details. It was super clean and well appointed with great pillows and soft sheets and all the other amenities. Atsuko and Satoru have put a lot of thought into the place and have made it very comfortable for guests. There were fresh towels in baskets in both bedrooms and nice slippers in the closet. Location was perfect for exploring Kingston. It was a comfortable walking distance from the shops and restaurants that I wanted to go to. It's a great place to stay if you have multiple guests in your party as it is a large apartment. Honestly it was probably too big for me, as I was traveling alone. One note - I didn't notice until the day of my trip that the check in time isn't until 5pm. which seems a little late and I would have preferred to access the space sooner. I know it was in the original booking information but I guess I'm accustomed to earlier check in time - 3 or 4pm. All in all though, a very nice stay."

Stayed with kids","We loved staying at Atsuko & Satoru’s 2-bedroom apartment. We really appreciated the Japanese snacks and minimalist design, which was really helpful with our toddlers to not have much to destroy! Nearly every detail was thought of and it's very conveniently located in walkable uptown Kingston with parking provided. There is one exterior stairs and one longer interior set of stairs to reach the apartment, but loading in from the street (not the parking lot behind the building) was a breeze. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough great things about this apartment. The location is fantastic - 5 minutes walk (or less) to wonderful restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bakeries, shops, lovely spots to work remotely...really everything you could need. The apartment is even more spacious than the photos suggest with great light and lots of charm. We wanted to pack up the entire bed - mattress, pillows, sheets, everything - and take it home with us. We settled for taking note of where the linens, etc. were purchased and adding them to our holiday lists. While street parking wasn't competitive, having the dedicated parking spot added extra peace of mind, and there were thoughtful touches like a humidifier with relaxing essential oils and Japanese snacks (who doesn't love an Airbnb that comes with Pocky??) In summary, this is a wonderful, spacious and comfortable apartment in easy walking distance to some of the most beloved spots in Kingston - highly recommend."

Awesome location with restaurants, cafes, shopping, and yoga right up the block. As other reviewers have noted, the bedding was excellent. I think the duvet cover, sheets, and pillow cases were at least part linen. I’d definitely stay there on my next trip. I would only add that for guests with mobility limitations, this space wouldn’t be optimal."

Stayed one night","I loved staying at the Bau Guesthaus . It’s beautiful and thoughtfully designed, with very comfortable beds and linens. Satoru and Atsuko have created a special experience here, even things you didn’t know you needed have been thought of.
The location is perfect and walking distance to many nice restaurants. We had brick oven pizza at Lola’s just a block away, very nice. Outdated cafe is always good for breakfast. We will definitely be back again:)"

Stayed one night","This is a wonderful, large, and well-appointed apartment. The owners are artists and the interior decorations reflect this--interesting lighting and antique furniture, including a clawfoot bathtub, albeit with a modern shower head. They also left an assortment of interesting, Japanese snacks and seltzers in the large, fully equipped kitchen. The beds were also very comfortable. The upstairs apartments are up a very steep set of stairs, so be prepared to work up a sweat carrying your luggage up and down. Also, the parking is on a small side-street behind the units and is difficult to find. The owners were in Japan when we stayed, so there was some delay in getting some, not all, responses, but they made every effort to keep in touch, even from a different time zone. We did walk to a nice place (Sissy's) for breakfast, but some places listed on Google had recently closed. Some recommended dinner-places were a short drive. Overall, we greatly enjoyed our overnight and would highly recommend the apartment."

You will be very comfortable here. Convenient location for exploring. It’s bigger than it looks from the listing, too. Only negative is no top sheet on the (very comfy) bed and the comforter was far too hot for July."

Stayed a few nights","My son and I enjoyed our stay at Atsuko & Satoru's place. We used it as our home base while exploring the Hudson River Valley. Very spacious, immaculately clean, and exactly as represented in the photos and description on Airbnb.
It is located on the second floor, so if you are traveling with lots of luggage or have difficulty with stairs, you may have an issue navigating the stairway ... it's narrow. It wasn't a problem for us, but I could see how it would be challenging for some folks.
The beds were very comfortable and I loved the duvet in the queen bedroom! So dreamy! The closet in the queen room does not have a light, but I discovered a closet in the living room with fabulous light and a full-length mirror.
The kitchen was well stocked and there was ground coffee, tea, snacks, flavored yogurt, and sparkling water. The kitchen looked well equipped if someone wanted to prepare a meal. Since we hadn't planned on cooking, we found several restaurants and coffee places within easy walking distance.
Although we only stayed for two nights, we could have easily stayed longer since Atsuko & Satoru's place was so lovely, well-appointed, and comfortable!"

Kitchen had the basics (salt, pepper, olive oil, vinegar) and lots of cookware needed to make meals. Lots of special treats provided such as Harney & Sons teas, Japanese snacks, yogurts and seltzers to make this place feel extra special and luxe.
Amazing location, right next to lots of fun places to visit such as Rough Draft book store and Lola pizzeria. Would definitely come back next time we're in Kingston. Thanks so much for such a thoughtful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We had an excellent stay at Atsuko and Satoru's place. There is a class of Airbnbs where you can tell that the hosts really try to go the extra mile and make the stay as comfortable and memorable as possible (rather than just trying to eke out every cent in profit). This is one of those places.
Pros:
- The apartment is super stylish, impeccably clean, and well laid out.
- Location is fantastic and central to downtown. It's on a major street but still very quiet.
- Incredibly well-stocked kitchen with all the essentials and some fun Japanese snacks.
Cons:
- Hard to think of any major issues. If I were to nitpick I'd say the floors are a little squeaky so if you're up early or late you have to be very careful to walk quietly so as not to disturb the downstairs neighbors.
Overall a great stay and I would recommend this place without hesitation."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I wanted a few quiet days in Kingston before the Thanksgiving holiday. Jocelyn's and Andrew's apartment was absolutely what we needed. Their apartment was the perfect getaway! When we arrived, they thoughtfully left us a bottle of Saragota water and chocolate. The apartment looks exactly like the photos - modern and beautifully styled with their artwork. The apartment seemed more spacious than in the photos and more importantly, it was immaculately clean. Great shower and water pressure too! Close and walkable to popular spots like Keegan's Ale House, Rough Draft and Kingston Bread, their apartment is a gem in Kingston. We loved it and would definitely return and stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I am writing this review after originally booking 2 nights and after our check out for our original booking.

Because of our wonderful experience at Andrew and Jocelyn's wonderful Air BnB and realizing we needed another night, we decided to reach out to see if we could book another evening here!
This great one bedroom in the heart of Kingston is a perfect getaway for 2. From the moment we arrived to find a bottle of our favorite sparkling water and a delicious chocolate bar, to every communication with this lovely couple, everything was an absolute 5 star experience.
You will find it immaculate! It has a comfortable bed, a roomy shower, a well stocked kitchen, great pottery (made by Andrew) throughout, and a lovely touch by Jocelyn with organic fabrics and her whimsical hand crafted wool art pieces.
Parking is right in front of the entrance, and the carriage house and the cottage extension is a wonderful site to pull up to.
It's a must to book!"

Coming to the historic house is a pleasure (note that guest accommodations are in an addition to the main building), and the location's is walking distance to Kingston's Stockade District, so great restaurants and shops are all convenient. The best part of every stay, though, comes from the warmth of these two talented artists who are genuinely welcoming. The apartment is very clean and comfortable and contains pieces of Andrew's pottery (I look forward each morning to pouring a cup of French Press coffee into one of the mugs!) and Jocelyn's textile-based artwork. The artists' studios are on site, so hosts are accessible and responsive... but everything is also very quiet for guests (you don't have to interact if you prefer not to). Jocelyn and Andrew provide helpful information about local services and attractions. We have recommended their place to many friends. Great stay!"

The kitchen is well-appointed and everything was clean and worked well (although note there is no microwave if that is important to you). The hosts were communicative and welcomed us with a treat. It was really nice to be able to walk to the uptown area and explore the restaurants there. Kingston is a charming historical town, conveniently located, and this apartment was a great value compared to the options in Rhinebeck.

Stayed a few nights","Had a wonderful stay at Jocelyn and Andrew place, the apartment is very quiet and private, tastefully decorated and spotless ! Check in was very easy, the hosts left all sorts of goodies for us, AC was working very well and it was certainly needed due to the outdoor temperatures. This is a gem of a place with caring hosts who provided all the needed help during our visit, communication was excellent.
Did I mentioned the white bathroom towels, that was impressive and in line with the cleanliness of the whole apartment. Location could not have been better, close to many beautiful outdoor places and Bard Music Festival."

Stayed a few nights",Jocelyn was such a joy to speak to throughout the trip! She made the check in so easy and provided some welcome treats that were a nice touch. The place itself is spotless and very thoughtfully decorated with all sorts of special ceramic items. Having off street parking is a particular plus and the easy walking distance to greet uptown spots like Lola or Kingston Bread is very welcome. Even though it’s right in the heart of the city it’s incredibly quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again.

For anyone without mobility issues, Uptown Kingston is an easy walk, and the other parts of town are a short drive. In other words, the location is great, and it was nice that there was an off-street parking space. The hosts made check-in easy. We would definitely stay again."

A perfect place to explore Kingston (some really fabulous restaurants) and the surrounding area. Woodstock is a short drive away."

Stayed a few nights","My husband Plato and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! First off, Andrew and Jocelyn are excellent hosts! They are extremely helpful, communicative and easy to reach. Their instructions make it easy to find the place and they ensure that the check in process is smooth and easy as well. We had a slight emergency on our way over which delayed us by hours. Jocelyn went above and beyond to be reassuring and kind and was so helpful as to leave some lights on for us so that we could find our way in easily since we were now arriving in the nighttime. They also made sure to shovel the driveway early in the day the next morning which made it easy to get in and out.
The place itself is well appointed, adorable, comfy and warm! It was a cold and snowy weekend and we were toasty and cozy for our entire stay. It is decorated in a very artsy, “non -cluttery” way that makes it feel bright and airy. It’s so esthetically pleasing that we found ourselves in particularly good moods as we cooked, listened to music and relaxed in the evening. This was definitely a place that is conducive to unwinding and relaxing. I definitely recommend this Airbnb and will be returning again soon."

Their place was extremely clean, minimalist, and decorated with their own art, which was incredible. The kitchen also had everything we could have needed to prepare a full meal, including seasonings, which was excellent and definitely cut down on our grocery list while there. The location of their apartment is walkable to a lot of great restaurants and shops, so it’s definitely manageable if you’re without a car like we were for a few days. Overall, we have zero complaints about their place. We had a great time and hope to come back soon!"

Andrew & Jocelyn are both incredibly talented artists, and their craftmanship, attention to detail, and artistry are evident in the apartment, from cabinets and other furniture, to fixtures and planters, to beautiful decorative objects. I will absolutely aim to stay here again the next time I'm in their neighborhood! Thank you again for a wonderful and relaxing stay"

Stayed a few nights","We were made to feel very welcome by Andrew & Jocelyn and enjoyed our stay in their apartment, despite having to unexpectedly cut short our trip. The apartment was bright, modern and equipped with everything we needed, and only a short walk from the center of Kingston. One word of warning, the sidewalks are very uneven so it’s probably best to drive or catch a cab into the center after dark. Also, shops close on Tuesdays & Wednesdays and we had some difficulty finding somewhere decent to eat on the Tuesday evening. We did however have a great meal in the Kinsley Hotel restaurant."

Stayed about a week","I think that we can most easily sum up our experience by saying that it was the perfect stay! We booked with Andrew & Jocelyn for a little more than a week over the Memorial Day holiday, taking a few days off and working remote. The Airbnb was in the perfect location in Kingston - super walkable and also a great jumping off point for exploring the area. We appreciated the dedicated spot in the driveway for our car, so that we wouldn't have to worry about street parking for the week. The space itself was laid out perfectly for the two of us - we really enjoyed the small seating area out front. The interior was beautifully appointed - minimal in design so that we felt like we could really relax, free of distraction - spotlessly clean, and had everything that we needed during our visit. Andrew & Jocelyn live & work on the property, so it was really lovely bumping into them on occasion - they were great about communicating with us, but also giving us space to do our own thing. I would without a doubt recommend them as hosts and their Airbnb makes for a wonderful respite in Kingston - we would absolutely stay again. Thanks for having us!"

We also loved Andrew’s ceramics, which were thoughtfully and usefully placed throughout the apartment.

They were extremely respectful and aware of all the necessary COVID precautions."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great place and centrally located. I especially appreciated the parking spot since it was mostly street parking. Overall a great place but two things to note. One, the hosts live upstairs so if you want complete privacy be aware of that (on the other hand it does make you feel safer knowing someone is around). Two, there isn’t a tv in the main living area (there is one in the bedroom) so you won’t be able to eat and watch a movie unless you sit in bed.
Neither of the above items are enough to detract from the overall stay."

The hosts are artists, so their space is filled with stunning hand-made bowls, vases, and other decor. They were very thoughtful and careful about COVID precautions— spacing out guest reservations to ensure that the apartment was squeaky clean when we arrived. Occasionally, they brought us fresh tomatoes from their garden (too pure for this world)! The place is an easy 10-minute walk from all of the central Kingston stores, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. My fiancé and I stayed here for a month and had a fantastic experience.

We were greeted warmly upon arrival as snow began to fall. After a long morning of travel and a glorious nap in maybe the most comfortable bed I’ve ever laid in, I woke up to our hosts shoveling the driveway and removing snow from our car! Examples of this kind of thoughtfulness were noticeable throughout the apartment as well, from the French press to the reading selection to the cool artwork and creative items handmade by our hosts themselves. Thank you for opening your home to us. We certainly hope to return again soon. Cheers!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a really chic, really urban apartment. Those from the City or Europe will probably love it. For us Midwesterners, it was a bit sparse. When Spring allergies hit, we had to use toilet paper because there were no kleenex. There were multiple closets with hangers, but no dresser. There was a counter with several stools which was good for a 15 minute breakfast, but made my back hurt for a 2 hour Zoom meeting. We missed having a kitchen table with chairs. The location would be really great on a weekend or in the summer. During the week in Spring, it was deserted with lots of unoccupied buildings and construction. There was two things open -- a good coffee shop and a Mexican restaurant. Everything else was closed. There was a lovely path along the Roundout creek, but it was so deserted that this 40-something woman didn't feel comfortable walking it by herself. I'm sure on a Summer weekend, when more things were open and there were more people around, it would be lovely."

Stayed a few nights","Exactly as described. Lovely, clean and in a great spot for strolling, shopping, eating and drinking. The space was plenty large enough for 2 couples, with 2 full bathrooms, and a full size kitchen being clutch. Instant, super hot water and great water pressure. As this is a recently rehabbed building, the furnishings and appliances are all new.
It's my understanding that the Kingston waterfront is hopping in the summer, so this would be a perfect spot to stay during that time, as everything is 1 block away! Parking was readily available either right across the street or just around the corner. Unit 4 is 4 flights up, so be mindful of that if you've got mobility issues.
My only tiny critique is that the bedrooms don't have dressers, just a closet, so we wound up using the deep window sills for the stuff that couldn't get hung up. Not a big deal, just a heads up if you're particular and/or a neat freak and will be staying longer than 2 days, where you'd want to unpack.
Thanks, Corryn!"

Stayed a few nights","The positives:
- great location, right around the corner from the downtown Kingston waterfront with everything it has to offer;
- perfect communication with the host; great local recommendations;
- easy in and out (electronic locks)
- new (completely rebuilt)
- very spacious, very clean.
- well stocked full kitchen.
The negatives (and I was a bit hesitant to write this):
- this is not a host's fault, but there are constructions everywhere around the place. That did not make the immediate area look nice. If you care about a noise during the day (we did not) it may affect you.
- this is definitely on the host: the apartment is / feels empty. Examples: there are no covered shelves in the entire apartment. There is plenty of space for a dresser under both TVs, but... empty. There is no dining table with chairs; only 3 high chairs at the kitchen counter. Utility closet has no door.
Summary - great place, needs a little investment, but not a luxury accommodation as advertised."

Our unit (top floor) was not ready on arrival. Apparently there was a miscommunication with their cleaners. Corryn and her husband texted us back within 5 minutes and immediately gave us the code to the unit below, which was pristine and beautiful. Even though we were not terribly inconvenienced, they gave us a credit which was greatly appreciated and so very professional. The space was clean, modern, and immaculate.

Stayed with kids","The Strand House is a great great great location, walkable to nature and shops and restaurants on Broadway.
My husband, 11 month old and I stayed for an entire week while closing on our house in midtown and it was a more than adequate home base. Our friend came to stay for the weekend as well and we all had plenty of space; having two bathrooms was really excellent.
The space is well appointed for the most part, and the beds (let’s face it, the most important part of a good place to stay!) were exceedingly comfortable, as were the pillows, which is rare!
Niggling critiques:
* I kept wishing there was a place to hang your coat by the door, only an issue if you’re staying for a whole week during winter coat season
* nowhere to put your personal toiletries or even a hook to hang washcloth/scrubber inside the shower
* very rough and thin toilet paper for an apartment described as “luxury”
If I wasn’t moving to Kingston, I’d probably book the Strand House again."

The beds/sheets/pillows were super comfy and clean. The kitchen has all of the appliances to cook our meals. It was also easy to find parking near the house. Corryn was also great with communication and helped us with directions and recommendations during our stay. Highly recommended as a place to stay!"

The location is convenient to local restaurants and stores. Street parking was not too difficult to find. The passcode made it easy to enter with multiple people. The apartment also had a history of the renovation book which was interesting. It got me thinking that it could be useful for guests to know more about the history of the neighborhood, and of the indigenous land as well."

I stayed with a friend to attend the NYS Sheep & Wool Festival and the location was perfect to be able to enjoy all of the different weekend activities that were going on in Rhinebeck, Saugerties, and Kingston. The riverfront is eclectic and fun with plenty of great food options within walking distance.
The apartment had everything that we needed. Cozy living room for evening knitting and movie watching, a full kitchen and two baths for privacy. The beds were very comfortable and everything was super clean.
One thing to be aware of is the on-street parking. Ultimately we were always able to find parking relatively close to the unit for our two vehicles, however, on late evenings it took us a bit of time to find something. Even so, I would absolutely stay here again!"

Small touches which reflect experienced hosts, a special makeup removing washcloth and super nice roller shades to reduce or increase sunlight through the large and deep beautiful windows.

Stayed about a week","The Joyce suit is a special place. Spotless and covid safe. Beautifully appointed with lovely tall windows that stream with natural light and offer peeks of the Hudson River we enjoyed making it our home for our week in Kingston. The beds are cozy and comfortable, and the towels soft and plentiful. The kitchen is wells set up for cooking and Corryn welcomes you with a coffee and tea set up, though- I'm a big fan of the doughnuts across the street. The walking location down to the Roundout is perfect. We were able to take advantage of long walks along the river and walking to restaurants which was super nice after tooling around in our car all day. The suite would benefit from a couple of extra blankets for those who prefer more than one, a lamp or two to read by, and an additional table to eat or work at. All in all it was lovely, I hope to spend another week at the Strand soon. Thank you Corryn."

The historic building's been beautifully remodeled and the beds were super comfortable. In the age of COVID, it was reassuring to see (and smell!) how clean the apartment was upon arrival.

Stayed a few nights","I went to Kingston to visit family, but I wanted to stay in a separate place because of the pandemic. Corryn's place was perfect for my needs. It is located in the Roundout, which is a trendy area by the river with great little boutique shops, restaurants, and a promenade. We ate at the Mariner Restaurant down the street, which has a big outdoor patio, and the seafood and service were excellent. The apartment is exactly as depicted in the pictures. As a senior in a vulnerable age group for COVID, I am really fussy about where I stay these days. Corryn's place literally sparkles with cleanliness that you can see and even smell the minute you walk in the door. The apartment has central AC and ceiling fans, both of which work great and keep the apartment comfortable even on hot days. The beds are super comfortable, and all the basic amenities are there. You do need to walk up a few flights of stairs to reach the apartment, but I had no problem and appreciated being on the top floor. Although there is no desk, I used my compluter comfortably while sitting on the high stool at the kitchen island. I loved all the natural light in the apartment. The only downside is that the windows are set so that they open only about 3 inches, which is a consideration if you prefer fresh air over AC. Corryn is a true superhost who takes health and safety seriously and responds promptly to questions. All in all, a terrific place to stay!"

Corryn made check in easy, and we had everything we needed for a great mini-vacation! We would definitely stay in the Strand House again. It is a a very special place, and we could tell a lot of thought and care went into renovating the space."

Stayed with kids","My husband, mom, 6 month old daughter and I enjoyed our stay. Checkin was easy. We stayed in unit 4 and had an ample amount of space, with the 2 bedrooms and 2 baths. We were able to enjoy our own meals as well with a stocked kitchen and thoughtful touches such as creamer and straws. Location is great and it was easy to find parking across the street. Unit 4 is a few flights up the stairs so if you have a lot of stuff like us, it will take a few trips from the car, but it was no big deal.
The kitchen sink was leaking when in use and Corryn was communicative and offered to have it fixed but since it was a slow drip, we asked if it could be fixed after we left to which she agreed.
Overall highly recommend this Airbnb. Super clean, great location and helpful host. Wish our stay could have been longer."

There were so many great restaurants just steps away and everyone in the town couldn't have been kinder. Corryn and her husband were amazing hosts who always made sure we were well taken care of and were always prompt when answering our questions.
When you walk into your suite you can immediately tell that Corryn put her heart and soul into the apartment and made sure to recognize the history of Kingston while doing so. My boyfriend and I are truly grateful we stumbled upon this gem and are already in the process of scheduling our next visit."

Stayed a few nights","A creative's dream building - an old historic factory-like structure renovated into modern open-space apartments. We were hesitant to travel with the Covid issue, but this was the perfect choice. It's a no-contact check-in and with only a few units, you don't see or hear others... there's a full kitchen, which is essential with the lockdown. We stayed in #4: vaulted ceilings, tons of windows and light, historic/unique elements, modern design, free movies etc. Kingston is charming and close enough to NYC - we got our fill of cute town + nature. The Strand is around the corner from one of the town's main drags and waterfront and close to parks, the beach etc. Corryn's communication is frequent and helpful. You won't find another airbnb (or hotel room) like this. It's a gem - just go."

The only drawback was that the Nest-controlled heat wasn’t working properly so it was a bit chilly inside. Not the worst of things but def being warm and cozy on rainy days is high on my list of wants. She and her husband did everything they could to try to help troubleshoot and I really appreciated the efforts. Would def recommend their place to friends. It was super cute and located in a darling part of town.

My daughter (17) stayed at the place while I went into Kingston and the surrounding areas for work related business and I felt she was very safe at the apartment. She ventured out to dine and the people in the area could not have been nicer. An elderly couple who sat across but whom she did not speak with at her at Ship to Shore picked up her tab for dinner. The waiter said that they were just nice regulars.The whole community was very hospitable and she really enjoyed her time in Kingston. This place is in a great location and is perfect for time away for the city to relax or if you are in Kingston on business."

Stayed with kids","Theresa was super communicative and her place is in a great location!
With a little love this could be a 5 star place but we had a 3 star stay.
The sofabed metal frame was broken so we couldn't use it. No problem, the air mattress was right there and easy to find...but my daughter woke up on an air-less mattress. Basically both were broken, thank goodness 5 year olds don't care about sleeping on the floor.
I'm also 95% positive the real beds are double beds, not queen as advertised. When we travel my toddler ends up in our bed I. the wee hour of the mornings sometimes, so a double bed is tough.
The place was clean but just a bit dusty. I had put some stuff on the bottom shelf of the coffee table and taken it out....covered in dust.
All that being said - the location is excellent, the host is super responsive, and if the bed situation gets fixed it sleeps a lot of people! Uptown Kingston is so great and there are 3 amazing coffee shops within one block."

Stayed a few nights","What a unique space! The space consists of two big floors above a shop on a main street in Kingston. Spacious is an understatement! We were right in the middle of everything, which was very convenient. I'm very into history so as soon as I could, I checked out the history of this building, which used to be a furniture store, clothing store, etc. through the years. Everything was clean, comfortable, and cozy. My only complaint has nothing to do with Theresa and is my own gripe about the lack of historical preservation. At some point in time, siding was used to cover the big, beautiful front picture window on the third floor. You still have the natural lighting from the back windows, so that's not an issue. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this space and this town! Thank you, Theresa!!"

Check in was super easy and the apartment is not hard to find. For parking the host has great instructions- we just did street parking for overnight and added coins to the meter at 9am every day since we found good spots right out front. Our car was safe both nights as well. I had a few questions for Theresa and she was always responsive and helpful which was much appreciated. The airbnb is huge and the kitchen is stocked with appliances, utensils etc. There was ever coffee, tea, and condiments for our use. The 2nd floor is a great hang out spot. The heating/ cooling units were effective too (we came on a cold and rainy weekend so we needed the heat). The only thing I would note (and that Theresa mentions in the airbnb description) is that the floor boards and stairs DO creak with every step. If you're a light sleeper then bring some ear plugs, nbd!"

So in sum it was great - completely met our needs. It also has a full kitchen which we didn’t use. Very spacious - I think a yoga studio - could have played pickleball in it - though not recommended."

The location inside is so private, its like your in your own little world- but when you open the front door, you’re in the center of everything the town had to offer! Not to mention, the rooftop access was so cool! It was well stocked with supplies and anything we had forgotten she had it there already. We’re seasoned
air bnb’ers at this point and this was one of our faves for sure!"

Group trip","Great place! Good for groups who don't mind not having a ton of privacy, due to the open floor plan. We stayed here to attend a wedding at Senate Garage and it was PERFECT, literally a block away from the venue.
I will mention that the wood floors are very creaky, so if you're a super light sleeper and are with people who use the bathroom a lot, you might get woken up a few times during the night. Wasn't really a problem for us, but it might bother some people.
Theresa was very responsive and was even kind enough to let us check in an hour early. Everything we needed - sheets, towels, shower supplies - was available to us in abundance. A super painless rental experience overall."

Part of me has always wanted to live in a loft so I got to have a taste here. Theresa is great to deal with, and everything went perfectly. Ideal location for Kingston, right smack in the middle of the nicest part with the most restaurants and shops. Shout outs to Diego's Taqueria for feeding us delicious dinner when most places were closed (Tue-Wed is limited, as in many towns along the HVA) and the Stockade Tavern (fun staff, great atmosphere, wonderful cocktails). I can't think of any suggestions to improve the place. Note this an old building with steep stairs to get up (it's on the 2nd and 3rd floors), so not a great choice if you have mobility issues. Otherwise - this is the place to stay in Kingston for sure!"

Group trip","Location. Location. Location. If you want to be in the heart of the stockade district, you can't do any better than this. You will have to be good at stairs as this old building has very high ceilings. It is two full floors from the front to the back of the building; both are completely open except for the one bathroom. Lots of space but only two portable screens for privacy. There is one bed & one pullout couch on each of the levels. The second level pull out has memory foam and is comfortable. The kitchen is on the top level and should be fine if you choose not to enjoy one of the very close restaurants or diners. It looks to have all the necessary tools. We only had one breakfast there. There is good table that can accommodate 6. Unloading your vehicle can be a little tricky if traffic is busy. On street parking is metered as is the public lot down the street during daytime hours. If arriving by bus,, you are three blocks down the street and the last block has covered sidewalks. Summary: right in the middle of the Stockade area but no street noise on our stay. Loft style open accommodation with quite a few stairs. Close to Trailways bus station."

Only thing to note is that the futon was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on, and we couldn't figure out how to inflate the air mattress (this was partially our fault though, since we arrived close to midnight and it was too late to contact Theresa for help with it). Thankfully we only had 5 people so we just shared beds, but it would be a bit uncomfortable for larger groups."

Stayed a few nights","Everything as described, Theresa answered questions quite fast, the location is ideal. Overall the loft was great, little details here and there. The upstairs would feel a lot better if it was painted white instead of purple, it throws the atmosphere off. We would come back and recommend it to others 🙂"

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect spot for us. Fantastic location, with lots of shops and restaurants on the street. The space was just as pictured - lots of open space, yet still warm and cozy feeling. Beds were comfortable, including sleeper sofa. We cooked several meals in the kitchen and had everything we needed to do so. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night",This loft was fantastic. Very large and clean space with all the amenities needed for your stay. It’s composed of two floors thereby offering privacy. Check in and communication with the host was top notch. Kingston is a beautiful area and this loft is located in the center of the town which was very convenient. Thanks again Theresa for hosting us.

Group trip","The loft is spacious and comfortable. It's in a terrific location, right in the heart of historic Kingston, surrounded by cafes, restaurants, and cute shops. Theresa was really helpful with trip planning and local recommendations. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this loft for anyone who doesn't mind stairs (we don't). Light sleepers should be aware that you will hear street noise, so ear plugs might be a good idea."

Stayed one night","The location in Kingston was perfect. Close to many food and drink options, a bookstore downstairs and right around the corner from a Walgreens and cvs. The place is two large rooms, so don’t expect a ton of privacy. The space feels large, clean, inviting, and with great energy. The beds were comfy and the kitchen has the necessary items. Well appointed. The roof access is a nice touch. Great stay. A bit on the pricey side of things, but a nice splurge."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay! Having the second and third floor really made for a quiet and relaxing week. Almost no street noise, and everything uptown just steps away. Also appreciated the third floor AC units. It was HOT for a couple days that I was there, but very comfortable inside. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a cozy space that's close to everything. Just keep the two staircases in mind if you are traveling with older (or very young) guests. I did a lot of up and down over the course of a week. Burned my vacation calories :) I also ended up just paying $20 for a monthly parking pass. Worth it to have my car right there and not worry about coming and going. Overall it was a great time."

Stayed with kids","Great loft in the historic area of Kingston. Large supermarket near by and a VERY good bakery next door. The space was very clean, spacious and Teresa was very responsive.
Few things the guest should know is that the spaces don't have any doors or walls separating the 2 bedrooms, living room, and dining space, so you basically have to walk though a bedroom to get to a bathroom on 2nd floor. The stair and the flooring was very squeaky, so that's the only thing we had a bit of tough time with at night.
Other than that, we had a great time."
