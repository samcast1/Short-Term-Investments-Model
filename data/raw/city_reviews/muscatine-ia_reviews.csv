Stayed a few nights","Sally’s condo was perfect from start to finish! Beautifully decorated, fully stocked with everything you might need and more, comfortable beds and overall, and then there’s the view and central location to downtown establishments. Our stay was perfect in every way! The building included a bar she also owns that we learned was built by my Uncle whose life we were in town to celebrate. That extra morsel of information was the icing on the cake for our family ❤️ We willl be back next time we visit family!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely adored my stay. It felt like home away from home as soon as I walked in. The view of the Mississippi & the bridge is so pretty. Loved hearing the trains go by. For some it might feel noisy, but for me, the sound of the trains was novel & soothing.
The kitchen was stocked well & the little things you often forget were there. My favorite was the soaker tub. Used it every day!
I will be back. Thank you Sally!"

Stayed a few nights","Sally's place was great and she was a very responsive and accommodating host! I contacted her last minute to request to stay because I needed a quiet place to get away and get some work stuff done. She was very quick to respond and accommodating of my late request. The place was very nice, clean, and as described. Even though I was focused on work during my stay and didn't really go out and about, I was still also able to enjoy the space and felt cozy and relaxed. I also loved being able to sit on the balcony and enjoy the river view during the evening. I will definitely keep Sally's place in mind for another get away!"

Stayed with kids","We initially were set to stay in the loft but the long term stay tenant increased their stay. James was sweet enough to offer his personal place as he was planning to be out of town so we still had a place to stay. He was very responsive and accommodating.
The beds were comfortable. I could tell he must have a dog because I could smell it but it was more focused to the stairway at the front of the building (an entrance we did not use).
We stay 6 days and there were plenty of towels and other amenities offered.
We will stay again in the future."

James was fantastic! He met us at check-in and gave us a tour and a history of the place.
It’s walking distance to downtown. So we went and had tacos at the local taco joint and they were fantastic.
I highly recommend the loft."

Stayed one night","My sisters and I were in Muscatine over night for a funeral. They wanted to stay in a hotel but not only were those expensive, they're small and I couldn't see 3 adult women getting ready for a funeral in one tiny bathroom. Melissa's place was absolutely what we needed. We showered then had PLENTY of space to get ready without being on top of each other. It was a beautiful day and we were able to sit out on the rooftop patio watching barges on the Mississippi River right across the street.
Melissa went above and beyond for me as in the rush to get to checked out and get to the church, I left my phone on the bathroom counter. I had her number in case I needed it but it was on my phone in the locked apartment. I was able to message her through the Airbnb website and she came down to unlock the door on her day off to let me inside to get my phone before I had to travel 4 hours home. She completely saved the day!"

Melissa is such an amazing person and a hostess with the ""most-est."" keeps the loft extremely clean, stocked with yummy coffee, board games, delicious smelling bathroom soap/s, and even has a great taste in wine. Her store below has an amazing wine selection; try some while browsing the unique gifts and beautiful jewelry."

Stayed a few nights","It's definitely a hidden gem! Upon arrival, I was already in awe and beaming with excitement, to not only get unloaded, then relax to the view of the Mississippi, but I was giddy to see the inside of this quaint shop.. Let me tell you! We were not disappointed with the shop; all the goods were made and/or selected with love. Welcoming staff and charming environment. Melissa is fantastic, bubbly, friendly, very knowledgeable about wines, and just an all-around exceptional host. She showed us up to the loft. I appreciate the character of old buildings, so the sound of the old steps below our feet was comforting. At top, we emerged to the beautiful green carpet and well designed loft space. Sky lights/windows allowed natural light. The balcony, that view! Yuck weather, dont worry, the kitchen window allowed us to soak in the view. Bed was superb! Furniture was comfortable. LOVED the homemade hand soap, shampoo/body wash, conditioner, coffee, and most of all, the hospitality! thank you!"

The listing was exactly as pictured and described, and our bed was super comfortable. We even had a designated parking spot in the back, and everything we might need inside of the space upon arrival.
Melissa was an absolute delight. She goes above and beyond for her guests. We look forward to returning when we can stay longer and actually enjoy the area, check out the shop downstairs at length, and just relax more in such a comfortable place. Even though we were only there very briefly we were still able to enjoy some coffee, and take a stroll to the water which is within walking distance."

Stayed a few nights",A perfect gem of a place. We are looking forward to returning during summer months to take advantage of the river views from the patio. Conveniently located in downtown Muscatine allows for a short walk to local shops and restaurants. Don’t forget to stop in to Creations by Oz to take a look at their unique collection of must haves.

The apartment, located above the store with a street entrance, is a spacious studio with everything you need. The queen-size bed is tucked along the windows at the front of the apartment, with an ample closet complete with a chest of drawers tucked inside. Night stands flank the bed with a full length mirror in the corner. Desk with chair is along the wall with good lighting, chair and couch with two ottomans, side table, and flat screen TV round out the living room. Kitchen is fully equipped with island seating, coffee maker, refrigerator freezer, stovetop, oven, microwave, table service and pots and pans. Bathroom has a nice size vanity, mirror with good lighting and shower. Rooftop deck is off the kitchen with a view of the river. Special touches include fresh ground coffee, specialty soaps and shampoo. Melissa also provided face coverings, sanitizer and wipes (COVID-19).

Stayed one night","Melissa's place is a fantastic spot to stay in Muscatine. Communication was easy, clear, and she was so good about responding to questions quickly. The space itself was in a great location with a nice view of the river, and it was more than comfortable for the three of us. Definitely recommend booking if you're staying in Muscatine!"

Stayed one night","Staying here is one of the all too-rare times where one will find under-promises and over-delivery. The attention to the seemingly too-little details borders on the fanatical. It would seem thought was given to nearly every want in advance, then the needs filled before you ever realize you have them.
The room - and I hesitate to call it a room, as even suite pales - is huge. Truly, the pictures do not do the room justice, nor adequately convey the scale. Simply put, one more that receives value on square footage alone!
The crown jewel here, however, is the bed. This is where oh-so many “professional” hotel chains fall down and disappoint. Mere words nearly fail at describing the comfort. One can - and will ! - spend more money elsewhere, but not experience the rapture, the bliss, the peaceful slumber of a baby as one will here.
There are two minor quibbles that make the stay one very minor notch away from perfect, and those are the shower and the TV. The shower head is placed so that it is very difficult to escape the water, which results in the soap being whisked away as soon as applied. Perhaps a shower head with a length of hose would be better suited for this space. The TV is a bit small and underpowered on audio given the huge space, but the glaring flaw is the confusing manner in which one finds the channel one wishes to watch. For example, there is no guide or direction to simply tune to KWQC.
Again, these are very minor and one might not even care about such trifles. I certainly would not let them stop me from rebooking, and one certainly will do far worse than staying at St. Mary’s."

Exactly what we needed after quite a few days pushing hard on the bicycles. Melissa is a great communicator and helped us out with local tips, kept our bicycles secure for us and is an all round fabulous person. We almost didn't want to leave."

I LOVE all those qualities. The space was SOOOO cute! And the bed was OH SO COMFY! You are right on main street with great food readily available, but with a full kitchen you could cook too! Plus you are one block from the river front and it is JUST LOVELY! I plan to rebook a little outing with my hubby in the near future. It's a great little space with an exceptional owner! If you are contemplating this one...BOOK IT!"

Stayed one night",Lovely place to stay in a town that we fell in love with. There were a few minor issues but they were very minor. The TV reception is quirky which was an annoyance for our grandson until I convinced him that the river was more interesting. He said the Murphy bed was comfortable. The main bed was very comfortable with very nice sheets but we were a little overwhelmed by the heavy coverlets. My grandson and I ate breakfast on the roof of the store below watching river boats travel up and down the river. It was delightful telling him stories about Huck Finn and Tom Saywer and enjoying the cool breeze. I cannot believe that guests would not enjoy staying here. We highly recommend this airbnb.

Stayed one night","Melissa was incredibly hospitable and went out of her way to accommodate me with a very late check in, on pretty late notice as well. The apartment had everything I needed and then some. Everything was clean, the bed was comfortable and had a lot of pillows (which I love), and the place is incredibly spacious. It may sound ridiculous, but even small touches like having the switches labeled was super thoughtful. Sometimes I’ll check into an AirBnB, see a smorgasbord of various switches on the wall and feel like I’m tasked with operating the Death Star, when all I want to do is turn on the lights!
It’s such a unique location above a shop downtown and you can see the Mississippi river from the back porch! Unfortunately my stay was rather quick, but I hope I get the chance to stay again soon. It’s hard for me to imagine that theres a better place to stay in Muscatine, especially for the price."

Group trip","With the hosts living on the premises still, any issues that came up were quickly resolved. A smoke detector was low on batteries, and was quickly replaced. A lengthy high quality breakfast menu was available. Flexible on pets coming last minute. Plenty of parking, our group had 7 cars there with no issues plus room for Bob and Paula’s vehicles. Awesome fireplace, great for pictures and effective on the cold nights. More than enough games between the pool table and game room. The bathrooms were clean and plentiful. Cleaning supplies were available to clean up as we stayed. Broom, vacuum, cleaning spray, etc. Amazing natural light in a quiet corner of Iowa, beautiful house with amazing people. Paula even offered to stop working in her office and took some group photos for us before check out. They were an excellent group for the ten of us 24 year olds."

Stayed with kids","We made a last-minute booking when we changed our travel schedule and needed a place to stay. What a find!
Traveling with my mom who has mobility issues, this place is great: ramps, main floor bedroom, even an elevator.
We unplugged and played pool, ping pong, games, did puzzles, roasted s'mores and sang songs by the campfire.
Every room was immaculately clean. Even the sheets on the beds smelled good.
The host serves breakfast (you pick one option from the menu and then it's served family style), and wow, it was not only tasty but a beautiful spread of food.
The kids liked the cats and fireflies. Sit outside and enjoy the tranquility and sounds of country.
Our whole stay felt lovely and comfortable, and if we could have stayed there every night of our trip we would have loved that."

The breakfast each morning was delicious and our kids especially enjoyed the little things like cats to pet, the pond, the sports equipment, etc. All in all one of our best family vacations ever."

Paula prepared absolutely delicious & very abundant breakfasts! She has many options for your favorite coffee, many options of sodas very reasonably priced ($.50/can) & is a great place to prepare lunch/snacks.
Paula plans to add a stove to access which would be great! Truly a gem of a place to stay!"

The kids loved exploring the huge house, doing puzzles and games, and putting on puppet shows. There was more than enough room for everyone. Paula prepared a large, lovely breakfast and even made gluten free pancakes, toast, and muffins for the needs of a few people in our group (which she did not know about ahead of time). We had a great experience and can’t wait to come back."

We will forever be grateful & thankful to them for opening up their home and allowing/helping us accomadate our immediate family members who came in from several states to share a small intimate wedding ceremony. Ms. Paula is a beautifully strong woman who busily tends to the duties of their home, both outdoors & indoors. Her homemade breakfasts are the absolute best and far surpass any typical ""Bed & Breakfast"". My husband and I are already eager to book for our one year anniversary and hopeful for many more, years to come! Thank you Ms. Paula & Mr. Bob!!"

Paula was the best host and was full of care when we were running a little late due to traffic. Our large group was on a 2500 mile trip from New England to Moab, Utah and this was the perfect place to lay our heads and rest for the 10+ hour days of driving we had ahead of us.
Breakfast was amazing. If we ever decide to run a trip west again in the future, we hope this house is available for rent, as it was a highlight of our trip.
Thank you Paula!"

Group trip","We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Buckman's Guesthouse. It was large enough for us to spread out or congregate together. It was quiet the first night, so we enjoyed watching the deer in the field. Things got busier when the rest of the fam showed up. The kids had plenty to do with the pool table and ping pong table. We sat on the patio and watched the kids play corn hole, frisbee, and they had a game of football with the large yard. The firepit was great at night.
Paula was the perfect host and she is a fantastic cook. Breakfast every morning was provided and probably the best we have ever had. 😋
Buckman's Guesthouse is out of the way, so get what you need on your way there. We never left the place once in the 3 days we were there and didn't want to.
Will be looking for a reason to return."

Thank you for this beautiful gathering place for our family to meet together under one roof. We have plenty of space and lots of things to do. In our time together this weekend, we finished a large puzzle, acted out the Christmas story from Luke 2 with costumes for the grandchildren, enjoyed delicious meals, played cards, had a memory card game challenge with prizes for daily winners, played ping pong and table pool, read some books, and watched deer from the huge windows.
The large family room makes it easy to gather as a complete family unit, but the five individual bedrooms and four bathrooms give everyone their needed space apart, too.
Thank you!!

Group trip","I cannot speak highly enough for how wonderful staying at Bob and Paula’s AirBnb was. My group of 12 stayed for the weekend of a football game and all of us were in agreement that staying there was the highlight of the trip. Their hospitality is unmatched and they made us feel like family while staying with them.
They are in easy driving distance to major towns and cities in the area. Bob and Paula live in a separate section of the giant house allowing guests to have their privacy amongst the five bedrooms and giant living/entertainment/bar area. The house is incredibly clean, very cozy, and is accommodating to guests interests of all ages (bar area, ping pong table, pool table, outdoor pond, outdoor fire pit). They supplied all necessary linens, towels, soaps, and shampoos and had candy and bottled water in each room which made it feel like staying in a hotel. I offered to help gather our bed sheets and towels for cleaning but Paula took care of everything.
Every morning Paula made our group a breakfast served family style that we chose the night before. We were all impressed with her menu of over 12 items and so many additional options served including scones, yogurt, fresh fruit, and coffee all in addition to your selected entrée. I also have to reiterate that this huge delicious breakfast is included in what you already pay. They provide unmatched value for everything they give your group in addition to how nice it is staying there all for a super reasonable price!
My group had the most incredible time spent here and we cannot recommend them high enough!"

Our stay there was absolutely fantastic. We absolutely enjoyed the conversations that we had with Bob & Paula. They really are great hosts. The house was more beautiful then the pictures showed online. The beds were extremely comfortable and the house offers everything you could want. And just like everyone else stated on their reviews the breakfast that Paula makes each morning are incredibly delicious!
I will definitely be looking at the Buckman Guest House the next time we come out to Iowa for a Michigan road game. And would recommend to everyone what a great place this is."

Hidden from the main road, the winding drive soon opens to reveal a gleaming copper roof that beckons a warm Midwest welcome. Warmth is the common denominator when describing our experience. From the great room’s glowing fire to the cozy blankets atop each bed, from each morning’s delicious breakfast to the hospitality offered by Paula and Bob. We were a large group of a dozen individuals who all were awed by the accommodations bestowed upon us. The Buckman’s have set a standard for our family’s future reunions that will be hard to surpass. But, not one of us wants to go anywhere else. Good Lord willing, we will be back!"

Paula’s breakfast was just wonderful and she made it so special. She was so willing to share recipes with us. The rooms were so pretty and had so much space. We all left feeling like we had been spoiled. Thank you Bob and Paula!

Buckman's B&B is a lovely place to host a family reunion as we just did! Everyone had their own space and the great room offered lots of together time. I highly recommend this venue for your next get-together. The value is unbeatable and Bob & Paula Buckman are friendly and capable hosts! :)"

Stayed with kids","Wow was this ever a fun place to make lasting memories! Every year I try to locate a home mid-point between IL and NE that is large enough for three families and four large dogs and is capable of keeping adults and small children entertained…not an easy mission 😊
The Buckman’s Guest House was a perfect place to kick back and enjoy each other’s company. Bob and Paula have really put their heart and soul into providing an experience uniquely different from most Airbnb’s. This was the first time I have ever been invited to gather all eleven of us at a formal dining table for a beautifully hostess-served breakfast. Such a blessing! We played games, fished, relaxed on the dock, porch, and patio, and put on puppet shows with the biggest selection of puppets I have ever seen!
If your goal is to rejuvenate your soul, be certain to choose this location for your next getaway.

There were beds available for each guest and plenty of bathrooms as well. The provided breakfast was also a hit with everyone. The rainy weather kept us indoors, but the pond and yard just outside the house are huge and would be great for group activities as well.

The amount of land available for the children to run and play is as advertised and so nice that our cross country runners practiced while on vacation, the dogs were happy, and there was even a slip-and-slide and other yard recreational items on the premises! The pond had lots of fish and we enjoyed being outside around the fire pit. The inside of the home is equally nice with plenty of activities too! There are glass doors that separate the guest portion of the home from the host's areas which made it feel more private. Bob and Paula are wonderful hosts and we enjoyed our time with them."

There is also a large gathering area, fully stocked kitchen area, fun game room, yard games, gas firepit, outdoor seating, and so much more. This place truly is a hidden gem!
Paula's complimentary breakfast was one of our favorites! The table was beautifully set, we had a wide variety of food, and everything was absolutely delicious! Paula takes your personal requests for the menu, and has everything ready at whatever time you chose is best for you and your guests. What a treat!
Bob and Paula were quick to respond when asking questions, and always tried to accommodate us in any way. They live in the home, and didn't seem to mind us bothering them any time we had a question, but also left us alone to enjoy our own personal time. Such a sweet couple!
If you are considering renting a room or the whole house, I highly suggest you do! This is definitely a place we will be returning to and telling all of our friends about."

We've stayed at other Airbnb's around the US and this one takes the cake for a large group and event space.

Group trip","This is a wonderful, peaceful place. Be sure and watch for the Buckmans Guesthouse sign on the road in. The drive off the main road opens onto the main house and that is when you realize you made a great choice picking this property to stay in. Bob & Paula live on the property and they greeted us warmly and quickly got us acclimated to the home. Paula has a wide selection on the breakfast menu and all of it is great. Bring your appetite to breakfast. Paula will understand when I say be sure and try the Crepes.
My family has enjoyed many guest homes and this rates at the top of the list. Outstanding rooms and attention to detail. You can tell this property is truly a home. It is worth the extra drive into the Iowa country side for the amazing ambience. Whether you are sitting on the patio having your morning coffee or next to the gas fire pit enjoying a late evening conversation the outside area is very pleasant. My wife and son played ping pong for hours which is something they haven’t done in forever.
I Highly recommend Buckmans Guesthouse for a family get together or a relaxing place to get away from it all."

Only thing we wished we would have known was they do have a cat. Nice cat but we had someone who was allergic to cats and if we would have known we would have stayed elsewhere. We also had our dog with us and our dog loves other animals but there cat did not seem to. We tried to block off the area so the dog wouldn’t bother the cat.
We had a great stay."

Group trip","You will make yourself right at home in a gorgeous, spacious home down a country lane. We had planned for so many activities, and found we were perfectly content gathering in the two main indoor spaces, grilling our supper and hanging around the firepit. We all slept like logs in the beautiful bedrooms, and I loved my walk-in shower! Breakfast was divine, and the perfect wake-me-up after staying up way past our bedtimes. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer!!!!"

We had a group of 8 and although it rained and we were not able to take advantage of the Frisbee golf course or have a fire on the patio, we had a wonderful time. We played pool and ping pong and just hung out on the many comfy couches. There were snacks and beverages available in the rooms and the common areas and in the morning we were treated to an amazing breakfast spread on a beautifully set table. This would be the perfect retreat for family gatherings or to get together with friends. I highly recommend it! We will be back!"

We had complete privacy and didn't feel like we were encroaching on Bob and Paula's space. Their hospitality is above and beyond! And her breakfasts were the icing on the cake.

Christmas trees were in every room adding to the festive warmth of the gorgeous fireplace. There were dozens of games to entertain all of us as a family and provided lots of laughter. Other times we settled back to relax under a blanket on one of the cozy couches. There was plenty of room for us all to be together or find a corner to be by ourselves. Paula fixed huge family style breakfasts and managed to fit us all around one table. It was a feast. Great way to get away and have quality time with the family."

Their home is beautiful with cool historical pieces collected from several countries and the view from every window in this place was quite relaxing. We woke up each morning with a lovely home cooked meal for breakfast which was sooo tasteful!!! We want to thank you both so much for a lovely stay and for accommodating all of us. We all slept comfortably and shared some great memories. We wouldn’t change a thing about our stay other than wishing we stayed longer!! If we ever find ourselves in IA again we would definitely hope Paula And Bobs place is nearby!

Having coffee and a mini kitchen available all day was great. The kids loved the game room; I think the ping pong table was in constant use. Having enough bedrooms/bathrooms for 3 families was a blessing, and it was great having everyone under one roof. The rooms and bathrooms were large and spacious. My father loved having an elevator to get up and down stairs. The best part was the easy rapport with the hosts. The great communication and warmth displayed made it all that more special.

The home, while historic, had all the amenities that we needed and was *exactly* as pictured and described. So spacious with more than enough room and seating to spread out both indoors and out. The home was immaculately cleaned and honestly one of the best AirBnB’s we’ve ever stayed at.
In addition, the level of communication was great. I believe we received a “thank you” message when we booked 5 months prior to our stay and a few days before our stay we received a note with details and even the option to check in a few hours early. Any questions we had during our stay were answered in mere minutes. And Janet, the house manager, was so very pleasant and welcoming.

Everything we needed was there to prepare meals and to feel right at home. The only thing missing was our pups! The house is GORGEOUS and we enjoyed watching the deer and wildlife from the floor to ceiling windows. And…the house was lit up perfectly when we arrived in the evening. The caretaker lives next door and she is a gem too!

Our family spent a wonderful Thanksgiving get together at this home. There was plenty of room to spread out. They were great hosts making sure all our needs and wants were taken care of.

Stayed with kids","The house is beautiful, clean, cozy, and spacious, with different retreats for family members to enjoy different activities: watching TV in the TV room, chatting/reading in the living room, playing games at the dining room table and snacking at the kitchen island. A collection of great family games got us talking, chatting and laughing. An additional treat was coffee stations in the kitchen and on the 2nd floor landing. Keurig coffee pods, drip coffee, teas, hot chocolate mix, creamer and even 3 flavors of coffee syrup. Bedrooms and closets were spacious. Beds were comfortable. Showers were hot with good water pressure. The view of the river out most windows was such a treat. While not all windows had curtains, being high on the bluff and facing the river, no one can look in. It's a 12 minute walk (3 min drive) past historic buildings to downtown coffee shops and stores. There is also a playground 3 blocks away where the kids (and young adults) took advantage of the slides and swings."

But since we haven't been together for awhile, this location and house on Ash Street seemed so special to us. We just wanted a place to gather to have endless conversations and meals together. We catered a couple excellent dinners and sat at the beautiful table in the dining room. The kitchen is spacious and so functional. The home has several inviting sitting areas (including outside areas), lovely bathrooms, and very comfortable sleeping rooms.
The host (and his wife) and the home's caretaker are very attentive and so gracious and kind. This enchanting home was perfect!"

Since there were only 3 of us in this spacious place- we each had our own bedroom and bathroom to ourselves. We could tell the hosts cared about our stay- they had taken care of so many small and lovely details. There was a nice welcome basket including information about/from the area, fire forks for s'mores on the fire pit, fresh flowers, and I truly felt they were happy to respond to anything we might have needed! The plants in the house are real and doing better than my own at my house I live in. Even the towels smelled good. I am not kidding and this is not a paid review. We really loved the house and our stay."

Extra special is that they keep some milk and bananas , and cereal / bars on hand so I don’t need to pack breakfast , and the full size fridge / freezer has space for my cooler / ice packs and all utensils I needed to make a pasta salad to take to family lunch the next day .

If you are traveling with others and using both of the bedrooms in the space, AND you are a very light sleeper (like me) then you may want ear plugs. Not because Karen and Bob are loud, they aren't, you couldn't hear anything from above. It's only if you are traveling with someone else that uses their TV or talks loudly in the second bedroom of the space... that wall is thin and you will hear them.
Otherwise, we heard nothing at all from the rest of the house, even though we woke up pretty late due to a late night at the wedding. I would absolutely stay here again!"

The space is the basement of the home where they live; but that is barely noticeable as the space that you will be in is a full functioning apartment in their basement. The kitchen is spacious and spotless, Karen even had bottled water and milk and a few leftover food items in there for us to use. The living room and dining room are quite large. And the two bedrooms are with comfortable beds. One of them even has a heating apparatus on top of the mattress. The bathroom was spotless. We always felt very safe, and slept well there.

Their lower level apartment is extremely clean , quiet and comfortable. They stocked the kitchen with cereal fruit , bread , milk , peanut butter / jelly and condiments . Loved the varied assortment of books and my daughter will enjoy the Wii games when she accompanies me upon my return . Thank you again so much for sharing your home , your neighborliness and cheerful attitudes ! I’m looking forward to enjoying your patio and neighborhood this summer !"

We lost power for about 24 hrs due to a severe storm and they were gracious enough to refund our money if we wanted to go elsewhere, but we did not, because as soon as power went out that evening they jumped on a solution and ran drop cords from their motorhome generators to make sure we could still be comfortable. They truly made it home away from home!!!"

Only because I can't stand it with a passion is why I'll mention my only complaint, which is the animal hair in the recliner and bench seat in master bedroom. It's not a problem for some people but I absolutely hate it on my clothes. The hosts done a wonderful job of remodeling this home and making it a nice and cozy place to stay. The town itself doesn't have much diversity at all, but we meet plenty of friendly people and even had neighbors walk over and ask about the Airbnb. I would stay again!"

The Pearl House had everything we could have needed even for a longer stay. I super appreciated all of the kid stuff available- toys, books, crib, baby bathtub, etc. Even a baby gate and a stroller! It's definitely family friendly. I'd totally stay here for our next family visit. Downtown Muscatine is what it is- it continues to get more scuzzy, but I didn't feel unsafe staying here. A thing to note for checkout despite a cleaning fee- you are asked to strip sheets and pillow cases and take out any trash cans that you used. It also says to wipe counters. We don't leave messes where we go so it wasn't a big deal, but just a heads up. It is a big place so it's probably time consuming to clean!"

I would definitely recommend Linda's place if you plan on visiting all the small towns in the area or plan on visiting Iowa City but prefer a rural setting.

The place was perfect for our needs (two separate families with lots of kids) where we could spread out; and the setting was excellent with the pond for fishing and the horses. Definitely recommend for a country get-away.

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying here. The host was friendly and very responsive, but not at all intrusive. The setting is beautiful and an easy drive to Iowa City, where we had great food both times we ate out.
We weren't interested in doing much cooking, so the kitchen facilities were more than adequate - full-size fridge, coffee maker, microwave, electric griddle etc. But there is no oven range, so keep that in mind if you are planning to cook big meals on site.
The bedrooms were comfortable and clean. The bathroom is roomy. There is a lot of room in the place to spread out.
The only downside for me was that you could hear the highway from the farm. It didn't interfere with sleeping or hanging out inside, it just made it a slightly less idyllic setting for me when sitting outside. However, the location relative to the highway also meant that it was really convenient to get to other places.
All in all, I can recommend this as a great place to stay."

Linda is incredibly friendly and approachable. She always includes the kids in feeding/caring for the horses and cats and my girls love that. Having the house attached to a barn is a huge draw for my youngest daughter."

It’s mentioned in the listing, but there is no stove/oven, so make sure you are prepared for that (there is an electric skillet). The kitchen space has limited counter space, so not really a place you’d cook a big meal, but certainly doable for the basics. Our kids loved the bunk bed and the big wrap around couch! A fun stay on our cross country road trip."

Stayed with kids","We hadn't gotten to spend much time with my brother-in-law and his family. Our kids range from 10 - 14 and this was exactly the weekend we needed to reconnect as a family. We told the kids no technology allowed and spent a lot of time outside. They loved playing with the dogs and cats, getting a fabulous horse riding lesson from Miss Linda, and playing on the rolling hills among the hay bales. They enjoyed the feeling of freedom to wander and play. There is a great fire pit and wood outside and we enjoyed making s'mores each night. We also had plenty of space to spread out inside (4 adults and 4 kids) and enjoyed board games and catching up. As soon as we got home the kids started asking when we can go back for a visit. We had a wonderful weekend! Thank you Miss Linda and C.P.!"

Stayed one night","Horse farm serenity
We're reviewing this property, and we'll send you a confirmation email if it's approved. In the meantime, you can post photos or
This was a beautiful property with 2 ponds and lots of rolling green hills. There is an option for horseback riding for an extra cost. The home that you rent is attached to the barn and you can go see the horses through the back door that leads directly into the stable. It is a fantastic place for dogs even when it's raining. The 2 bedrooms and bathroom are downstairs and the flooring is a finished concrete so you can breathe a sigh of relief worrying about accidents. One bedroom has a full bed and lots of space to put suitcases, cpaps etc. The second bedroom has a full bunkbed and another double so it fits six. There are fold out beds also. The bathroom is large and has shampoo and soap, hairdryer, and a washer and dryer with detergent and dryer sheets. They are pretty old and the washer takes forever to fill, the dryer takes a couple of runs to dry everything. Real towels for the shower. The shower has great water pressure, Ok temp, but is small made smaller by the two built in shelves. The upstairs is open concept with a good size dining table, kitchenette, full size fridge. They had eggs and bread for us to use. Then there are other odd and end chairs that fold and a large sectional. The TV is small and did not work the night we were there. They supply plates and utensils, microwave, small cooking appliances, odds and ends. You park right in front of the front door and can back up under the covered front to load and unload if raining. There is a hanging swing under this for watching the sunset. We saw Canada geese with babies, a pheasant, and their six horses. Just off hwy but you don't hear traffic.. It was my favorite place this vacation."

Stayed a few nights","Linda is definitely a Superhost! She and her husband C.P. greeted us when we first arrived. C P. told my husband he was welcome to fish in either of the 2 ponds. Geese and ducks were around the ponds and a joy to watch. I saw a male pheasant who was so pretty - he didn't even look real! Linda introduced us to her new puppies - Gunther and Ellie. The property was beautiful. The wrangler house was large and had just about anything you'd need for your stay. There were 6 horses, and Linda invited me to ride with her one evening. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and visiting with Linda. Next year, I hope to ride every day and to help Linda with feeding and grooming her horses. We were both thoroughly pleased with our visit in every way."

The house is two stories and is very big......so we never felt like we were on top of each other. We had campfires each night (a big thanks to CP for bringing over a ton of wood for us to burn) and we all had such a great time. We took the kids over to Fossil Gorge (25 minutes away) where they spent the afternoon searching for 400 million year old fossils. Linda also took the girls horseback riding.....and we all had a blast.
If you do stay here.....make sure you spend some quality time with Mr. Whiskers....the most friendly kitty you can find! This is a high-quality Airbnb....and you won't be disappointed."

Stayed with kids","I was blown away upon arriving at Linda's farmhouse/barn. As we drove up the curving gravel rode, a white-tailed deer bounded across the lawn. We saw dozens of rabbits. There were 2 ponds on the property. Linda lives in a gorgeous house just down the path from the Airbnb house. The Airbnb is connected to the barn which was totally awesome for my kids. My older daughter got to help feed and brush the horses and had a lengthy and very reasonably priced riding lesson. She has been to horse camps and a few lessons before and said this was by far the best. My younger daughter was able to help feed a new baby barn kitten and Linda let us check in on the kitten throughout our stay which made her year! My son and nephew got to fish in the pond and pulled in 10 or so fish during our 3 days. We were able to quickly get to Riverside, Kalona, and Iowa City for some additional activities. The indoor space is exceeds what is shown in the photos. I would suggest bringing measuring spoons/cups/cooking utensils and silverware if you plan to do much more than grilling and microwaving. We got along just fine with the grill, microwave, and skillet. Linda and CP were attentive and friendly but never seemed intrusive at all. We would totally stay here again!"

The property is beautiful and so relaxing. This place is all about the oitdoor experience. The animals such as barn cats and horses and even her dogs made this a delightful place to sit on the porch swing and enjoy the scenery. If you want to have a full kitchen, skip this place. It’s more about simpler things like grilling with the grill and charcoal provided..don’t worry, there is a microwave and electric skillet. There were some unexpected things for a city girl like me, I wasn’t expecting the house to have some of the barn scent. The water was sulpherous but she provides a Brita. And because it was an odd time in the season there were some spiderwebs and pet hairs about. If you are about bringing your dogs with you and taking in some country spaces, this is for you."

The upstairs bathroom had plenty of room for us to get ready for a wedding.
Was able to make a dessert for thanksgiving in the fully stocked kitchen.
We will definitely stay again when we come back next year :)"

Although unneeded by my family, there were plenty of necessities for families traveling with children. Monika was a lovely host, and we would definitely stay again should we ever find ourselves in the area."

I would stay again and recommend you consider Monika's place if your business or travel takes you to Muscatine."

It's worked out so well that I'm booking it for another 3 weeks. The home is clean, comfortable, and has what you need for an extended stay. Monika inquires about your comfort and responds to your questions and comments. Thumbs up for me!"

Came up under pet friendly but when you get there the rules say no pets so I had to keep our little dog outside. Luckily it does have a small fenced area, but still getting charged an added fee even though I couldn’t have him inside at all."

Loved everything about our overnight! Thanks!!"

Stayed one night","Snow affected our travel plans and we were blessed to find Kiff’s Airbnb , he went out of his way to accommodate us on short notice, and even left us a sweet note and cookies when we arrived.
We were amazed from the time we open the door to such a beautiful chic, nicely decorated place that was so extremely clean and spacious! I can’t say enough how much we love the decorations and design, from the glamorous dazzling chandelier, attractive flooring, tasteful wall decor, large charming dining room table and island, such comfortable beds, well equipped kitchen these were just few of the many things we enjoyed!
Even though it was only my husband and I this Airbnb would easily accommodate a larger family or for an extended stay.
We have traveled a lot and stayed at many Airbnb’s. This is my new favorite ,thank you for having us."
