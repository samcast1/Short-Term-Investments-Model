Stayed over a week","Pros:
This place was absolutely beautiful. Super modern and clean. Lots of light. Comfy furniture. Solid internet. Kitchen was well appointed. The on site washing machine was convenient. And the cleaning room was stocked with all the extra pillows, towels, and sheets we could ask for. Cathy, the woman who maintains and cleans the units was super friendly, and fun to talk with. Would book again.
Cons:
The walls are super thin. You can easily hear conversations in the adjacent units. Ear plugs were helpful.
All and all this place rocks."

Stayed with a pet","We booked this airbnb due to the location of a much anticipated family reunion. Zina was very quick to respond to our inquiries. The loft was equipped with everything I needed to prep foods for the 'big day'. We experienced a few 'hiccups' which were promptly attended to. Bonus was being able to bring our 11 yr old rescue cat. ❤ Unfortunately, because we were constantly coming and going (with family), we didn't actually meet Zina until a few moments prior to our departure. What a kind and lovely soul! Wish we'd had more time to interact as our conversation flowed. Since we brought our F150, close-up parking was a bit of a challenge however, there is another parking space provided, further from the loft's entrance. Location was in a very nice neighborhood, tucked away, with peaceful surroundings. We will forever remember such a wonderful wknd, long after the calendar pages have turned. Much love and choicest blessings to you, Zina. Thanks again for making your lovely getaway available."

Stayed with a pet","We had an incredible time staying at Zina’s place, and if anything the pictures don’t do it justice—it’s even lovelier in person. It was so peaceful and relaxing, just the tonic we needed after a crazy day at the local beaches. We loved watching the evening light fade over the farm from the rear window! But the best part of our stay was Zina herself. She was highly responsive to our every need and inquiry and she made our visit so much better with her local recommendations. We would not hesitate to stay here again or tell our friends to stay here. Thanks Zina!"

From the very beginning while booking—I had questions about bringing my furry friends—and she was quick to respond and made it an easy choice to stay at her place. Finding lodging with two doggies is not always easy! Her place was easy to locate and check in, and squeaky clean and homey when we got there. The loft is adorable and was a really neat little place to stay for a few nights for a friend’s wedding. It’s private and has everything you need. She even had some dog treats in the kitchen ☺️ Zina and her family were so kind and welcoming, and we would definitely stay at her place again if we are in the area!"

We loved staying here and would definitely rent it again. It is a Loft so you and your pet will need to be able to do steps."

Stayed with a pet","Perfect! My German Shepherd ( 16 months old) loved the yard and the walks in the quiet neighborhood. It was nicely located close enough to downtown Salisbury where most of my business was situated. Everything about the space and the owner herself resonated peace and order, exactly what I needed! Already anticipating my next stay when in the area again and have recommended the Tree Top Loft to two others."

Stayed a few nights","Zina and her space was amazing!
The space was big enough for me, my partner, and our 60lb Staffy to enjoy our anxious puppy’s birthday/thanksgiving away from a huge holiday crowd.
The loft had just about everything we needed to enjoy our intimate stay.
The bed and the shower were EVERYTHING!
The tv was a little tiny (and we forgot our firestick remote) so we used it mainly for background music — again, perfect for our needs.
We brought our dog’s bed and crate but she preferred the dog bed that was provided, haha. She even enjoyed the doggy treats that were provided!
Zina was sweet enough to bring us some homemade pumpkin pie on thanksgiving! 🥧🧡
We were less than 10 minutes from just about everything: groceries, restaurants, pet stores, you name it!
We would definitely stay here again should the opportunity arise!"

Zina was very helpful with suggestions on where to go to the beach. The place was clean and stocked with breakfast items (eggs, fruit, etc), extra blankets, and local brochures and coupon books. Overall Zina made everything super easy and convenient for us. We would definitely stay here again."

The photos of the loft apartment are completely accurate. There is plenty of space for two people comfortably, and having thegarden space outside just adds to the accommodations. Her gardens are full of wonderful surprises, including a giant fig tree next to the loft's porch!
We will definitely check with Zina fist when coming to Salisbury again. and hope to enjoy a fruitful friendship with her from now on."

Stayed a few nights","We don’t travel a lot but we don’t need to in order to be confident that Zina’s loft was by far the best Airbnb we ever have and ever will stay at. The loft above her garage is the cutest studio ever that felt perfectly clean, was well ventilated and fresh thanks to some awesome giant-bladed fans and window A/C unit, and featured a full, miniature kitchen. Despite being an objectively small space, there was absolutely plenty of room for two people to stretch out without clutter. We have no complaints whatsoever.
Zina’s backyard is also incredible with several sectioned and specific areas including a fire pit, greenhouse, cottage-shaped shed, and pool. (We didn’t ask if any of these are available for tenant use - I suspect they aren’t - but it still makes for a beautiful environment to wake up and come home to.)
When we arrived, Zina met me (from a distance!) to make sure I got in okay and, inside, the AC was already running and there was even water ready in the kettle for the tea and coffee she provides.
The large bed is probably too big for the space that it’s in meaning you have to almost squeeze past it to get to the bathroom but who can complain about a big bed?
Overall, we almost asked to extend our stay because we simply didn’t want to leave. If you are looking for a place outside Salisbury for one or two people to relax and feel instantly at home in a place you’ve never been, look no further."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, great house, great value and even greater host...we had a great stay at Kevin's! We came to Salisbury with my 87 year old mother to visit family and friends, and she really enjoyed her stay in the house. The townhouse is in a convenient location on the northeast side of town and easy to get to anywhere in Salisbury in about 10 minutes. The house itself is very homey and accommodating. There was a rather steep flight of stairs but my mother was able to get up and down with no problem. And finally there's Kevin... maybe the most amenable, friendly and accommodating Airbnb host I've ever encountered, and that's saying something because my experience with Airbnb hosts has almost always been very good. Kevin is just the best. We had a few special requests for my mother and Kevin went above and beyond to make it all happen. The next time we come to Salisbury we know where we'll be staying...Kevin's is our new Salisbury home!"

The living room was homey and had plenty of room for movie night with the kids and grandchildren. Bathrooms were beautifully updated. Beds very comfortable. And the basement was a hit with the games and extra space to hang out. The backyard and firepit was the cherry on top! It is set up perfectly and we absolutely loved it! This is a property we will visit MANY more times as it truly felt like home away from home! Thank you!!

The washer and dryer were super convenient, the driveway had a lighted and designated space for us, and the water in the fridge was very much appreciated. The little touches around the space made it even more enjoyable (including the decor, books, charging stations, WiFi, and even the posted ingredients that are included in the shower toiletries. More generally, the instructions were very easy to follow for check-in, using the amenities, and finding our way around. Michael was proactive and friendly in all his communications.

The studio truly had EVERYTHING we needed to feel right home including a microwave, washer/dryer, and even shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower that smelled amazing! We were so comfortable cozying up in the bed and logging into our Netflix account on the smart tv to resume watching our favorite shows. While we only stayed one night, we know exactly where we plan to stay every time we’re in Delmar. Mike and Max Meegan were such wonderful and personable hosts!

Stayed a few nights","Fine. The soap is watered down, toilet paper is less ply than a public bathroom. When I came there was no heat on and it was freezing. There are signs all over to keep the lights off to conserve energy. At checkout guests are required to empty fridge, wash dishes, collect linens, and take out trash. The last one really killed me. Through the stay i was writing things off w/ benefit of the doubt but I’ve never stayed at an Airbnb where I had to takeout trash to checkout. If I’m doing all the above, what am I paying a $50 cleaning fee for? For a load of laundry and to sweep the floor? $2 hand soap is available anytime anywhere, at the point one is watering down soap one should stop and reconsider; it’s not saving anything.
I’m frugal, and I recognize when others are trying to shake someone down for their money. This was that which is wild because Airbnb is a hospitality service. It’s in the name!
The unit was safe, as described, and utilities worked."

Restaurants and Walmart right across the street and a Starbucks less than 2 miles away. The home provided privacy with the large master bedroom being upstairs. I had no complaints other than the beds being on the firm side. Other than that, our stay was extremely comfortable and I would highly recommend his place to anyone in the area."

I usually cook when I stay here but local restaurants have always been an excellent choice whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I also with local grocery stores if I am cooking supplies I might have forgetting are a minute away. Lastly, when it's time to go, I can top off my tank on the corner before hitting the highway.

John, always has the Johnna's House spotless, water has always been hot and everything in the kitchen was always work magnificently. Parking my car in the garage give me an additional level of safety and security. Although, now that I am comfortable with the area I leave the car outside until I am unloading or preparing to leave. Having the car even ten feet closing shortens my trips during the loading process."

You could tell the host puts a lot of effort into creating a nice experience for guests. It didn’t seem like the greatest neighborhood as the surrounding houses were all in pretty rough shape but we had no issues and would stay there again. It’s on a main road very close to US-13 which was very convenient for getting around town. The price was about the same as what hotel rooms were going for in that area so it’s a solid value.

To begin with, the location couldn't be better. It is situated in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, close to restaurants, the charming waterfront, and the best coffee in town! It has been recently remodeled to perfection and we loved how Sharon’s attention to detail was present all throughout the house. From the bedding, to the towels and spotless interiors, we wanted to move in - permanently! Easy access to the entry with no problems at all and immediate response time for any questions. Even delicious local treats and local coffee were there awaiting our arrival along with a lovely note. When we accidentally broke something, Sharon and Matt were there to fix it within 30 minutes, going above and beyond to make our stay perfect. We will definitely be staying here again when we are visiting Salisbury- can’t wait! It’s no wonder Sharon is a su"

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved this house for our stay in the Salisbury area for a family member’s wedding! SO much better than staying in a hotel block, we felt right at home and Sharon & Matthew’s space was even more beautiful than pictures could show. The house is extremely spacious, so even with multiple adults, children and a pup we had plenty of room to feel comfy during our stay. This may have been the cleanest Airbnb that we’ve ever stayed in, so if you’re someone who worries about cleanliness when you’re booking a place, look no further.
The neighborhood was gorgeous especially during our fall stay (in October) and we took our dog, Moose, on multiple walks through the neighborhood during our time here and loved all of the foliage and Halloween decor around! Also Sharon & Matthew let us use a dog crate that was the perfect size for our dog during our stay, so it saved up some room in our car.
We will definitely stay here again if given the chance! Would absolutely recommend :)"

The rooms were spacious, labels on switches & drawers made things easier to find & I wish that I’d had time to cook in her well organized kitchen stocked with quality equipment. The neighborhood is very nice & was quiet & peaceful. The back patio was inviting with a grill, seating, & a gas fire pit. Check in & out was easy. Sharon’s response time was good too. We would be happy to stay there again & wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Sharon’s place.
The only suggestion I’d make is to have night lights in the bathrooms🙂"

They put so much thought into what someone needs in a home away from home. Their home is spacious, relaxing and inviting. We cooked every night and they had all we needed to do so, including the bbq grill. Their sweet touches, from the snacks left for their guests to their personalized hand written welcome card made this stay above the rest. Their flexibility with us to make sure our kiddo was settled in for college, was so appreciated. I just hope when we go back their property is available as we will definitely book here again.

Everything is labeled so there is no question about where things are (even light switches). I was going to make a store run for paper products and utensils but found a stash in a cabinet. Speaking of the cabinets… the organization of this kitchen is unreal; it definitely gave me inspiration to get mine together at home!
I spoke with Sharon a couple of times and she was SO sweet! This home is approximately 45 minutes from Ocean City, but it is a straight shot and located near lots of restaurants, grocery stores, and other spots.
Lastly, I appreciated the inclusion of the beach umbrella and chairs with the home because it saved us so much money on rental fees at the beach each day! Can’t wait to come back next year - this time we will actually use the grill and fire pit!"

He was friendly and responsive. When the counter top stove didn’t work Rod and his wife went out the way to get a new one and replaced it for us. When we got to the house at first rod was there to greet us and show us around. The place is located close enough to travel to ocean city and Berlin. The town itself and had plenty to do. :))

Stayed one night","Rod was very responsive. The inside of the suite was nice., but the air inside was too warm. Unfortunately, the homeowner controls the thermostat. While I was told to let them know how the temp was for me, Rod's wife came over, said it felt fine to her, and turned off lights saying they were probably making it hot. I asked for a fan and one was brought to me. Later, I received a message that they hoped I was comfortable and it was ""cold"" in their part of the home with a picture of the thermostat. A 2nd unit would be helpful so that renters can be in charge of their own level of comfort and the owners won't be ""cold"". Also, the water pump that drains the extra AC water is in the unit and very loud. The fan provided was loud enough to drown out the sound as it sometimes drained as frequently as every 15 minutes. Smaller issues -no ice cubes in the tray upon arrival, the surge protectors that power the TVs hadn't been turned on, and there was only one bath towel."

Loved the amenities... the little extras.... though I loved the tea, a little decaf would be good.
the only issue we had was that there was no frying pan to cook eggs, pancakes or bacon... just sauce pans.
Oh yea... the lock box was a bit tricky...the key kept getting caught in the hinge and was hard to close.
But we really like the place."

Stayed with a pet","We were looking for a place to crash after being at the beach for the weekend, where we could get some sleep and complete some work that was due the next day. This place was on the way home, met our needs, and was resonably priced (there was some price gouging going on this weekend). When we arrived the place was as described. Getting in was easy (lock box with code to get the key). The entrance is right into the bedroom which was a bit odd, but nothing to complain about. The rest of the place was comfortable and clean.
Unfortunatley the internet service was out and because we had no cell service, we were not able to contact the host to see if it could be fixed. We had to drive into salisbury proper to get service. By that time, and because I needed to get work that required the internet done, we ended up booking a hotel and stayed there. The host was understanding and refunded what we paid minus ABNB charges, which was very generous. If the internet had worked I'd give five stars."

Tight quarters in kitchen and bathroom. One bedroom is private, but pullout couch is not: there's no way to pull the privacy curtain out when the bed is extended. Had an issue with internet bandwidth first night, but it was cleared up promptly. Friendly cats came around a lot to say hi. No bowls in kitchen, but the Keurig machine was a nice surprise. Full-size refrigerator and freezer, but doors do not fully open due to tight space. Ample lighting, A/C was very good, and shower was nice. Had a lot of ants in the bathroom throughout our stay, but that is an easy fix. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in rural Maryland."

The bed was comfortable and it was really nice to have a full kitchen. The outdoor space is adorable. It rained but I will definitely use it next time. A great experience with Angela!"

Stayed a few nights","I contacted Ryan as I was boarding my flight. He responded quickly. I mentioned I wouldn’t arrive until 3/4am. He was very flexible. The property had a mobile keypad which made things even better.
The location was just what I needed for the short trip to Salisbury. I was traveling alone so it was a little scary walking into a three bedroom home to stay alone. However once I opened the door the space felt like home. From the plants to the couch with nicely folded blankets in a wicker basket.
The kitchen was huge but I didn’t use it at all. As I walked down the hallway I noticed the first bathroom which was spotless.
The bedrooms were well decorated with nice size closets and drawers for extended stays. I picked the room with the bathroom, which was also clean, even the curtain liner.
I kept looking for a flaw just because it felt to good to be true but there weren’t any.
I ended up checking out a few days early and Ryan gave me a partial refund.
Best airbnb in the city"

We walked in and immediately loved the house! We all felt right at home! I loved the little touches like the flower made out of toilet paper that was placed on the back of the toilets, the board games, the guest book, and the book thing they had with the recommendations! I was very surprised to find that there were dishes, utensils, and silverware! Also a washer and dryer! The entire stay exceeded my expectations! The house was immaculate! They even placed towels and what not on the bed! It was like a home away from home! Also they had spices as well! I will defitenly be booking again in the future! 10/10 would recommend!"

The location was great, lots of restaurants less than 1 mile away, also less than1/2 mile away from Salisbury University which was great since we were there to participate in the century ride! (1st century ride was a success!) I would definitely recommend and would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Salisbury Cottage was perfect!
Ryan is a great host and is very responsive detail oriented.
The cottage was inviting, comfortable and meticulously cared for.
The neighborhood is quiet and
just a two minute drive to Salisbury University.
We took Ryan's suggestions in his guest book and had two fantastic dinners at local restaurants.
We plan on staying at the Salisbury Cottage whenever
we're in the area.
Why can't every Airbnb be like this one?"

Stayed a few nights","Is giving six stars an option? This place is the real deal; it's obvious the hosts thought about folks spending time there and what they might need. Enough extras are tucked away to make your visit functional without it feeling like the place was clogged with stuff -- we were particularly impressed by the pantry having the makings of a quick meal. The coffee maker supports Keurig pods as well as brewed coffee for up to ten cups. Better yet, the manual is present so you can figure out how to work the timer (it's a little unusual).
The place has a farmhouse feel, but there was also a definite emphasis on making it functional. The public areas have a spacious feel that makes it easy to sprawl out -- or work together on making a meal. It's worth pointing out that functional includes comfortable. You might be surprised by just how dark and quiet the place gets, too; with the blinds down it feels very private.
The guest guide provides a lot of useful information, and Ryan was very responsive to all questions we had."

I did have some back and forth communication with her as I was arriving a bit late, but she was extremely accommodating and super friendly.
The house is super, super clean and very well organized. There was ample parking upon my arrival. I was only concerned with getting upstairs, taking a shower, and sleeping, so I didn't utilize the living room or kitchen or any of that. Fresh linens, warm shower, comfortable bed and extremely peaceful sleep. Everything was available for a great, comfortable stay, probably more so than most people's houses! I actually slept about 2 or so hours more than I had planned to, it is really just that comfortable. Checking out was super simple, with ample instructions on everything. Overall, the stay was better than expected, and easily a 10/10."

Stayed a few nights",Ann was a great host! Very accommodating and was prompt when we needed her. She even added extra comfort and support for a mom dropping her baby off to college. The area is great. In close proximity of great restaurants and shops for quality time and dorm prep. It was also in walking distance of the campus as I was able to get a few surprise “I miss my mommy” moments during settling in. This home had every thing we needed even the basic supplies to get us started until we were able to get to the store which I thought was extremely thoughtful. Everything was in working order. A very beautiful and comfortable home with a host to match! It exceeded my expectations.

Ann was responsive and allowed us to check in early, which was so appreciated as we were coming from Baltimore with 2 little kids. Just make sure you bring your own bath & body wash and towels as there are none. But that wasn't a big deal, we only stayed one night and if we really needed to, CVS was around the corner. Loved our stay. Price was better and house was way better than the big name hotels nearby."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic find! I booked this house so I could stay with my mom in a clean and comfortable place while she recuperated from eye surgery. It was everything I’d hoped for and more! Super comfortable, extraordinarily clean, generously stocked with supplies, new everything, etc. We both felt like we’d had a mini vacation!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is EXACTLY what it boast!!!
The place was impeccably clean. Ann has everything you need and a whole lot of little extras just in case you forgot something.
I rented this airbnb because I was hosting a baby shower for a family member. We used the location to prep and sleep and it was EVERYTHING!!!! The location is close to a lot of shopping centers so you will not need to go far for anything. After all the work was done we got to relax in the quietness of this quaint little home and it was just what we needed. The rules are simple to follow and the area is very very quiet for relaxing. I would definitely return here if the need arises."

Stayed a few nights",Ann was just amazing. Her house was spotless and comfortable. She had everything you will need for your stay. Ann was just great with communicating and ensuring me and my family was comfortable. I asked her several questions and she never made me feel as I was bothering her. She was so pleasant and helpful with guiding me where to eat and advising me where was the nearest auto repair. Thank u Ann.

It was within 15 mins of the fields, about 45 from OC & close to several breweries. Located in a quiet neighborhood & close to Salisbury University. I highly recommend! Ann is a wonderful host!!"

Stayed over a week","A perfect home-away-from-home. Ann’s place is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, convenient to all—the university, playgrounds, shopping. And it is one of the best appointed houses we’ve ever stayed in! Ann has thought of everything—and then some! And if there is anything Ann hasn’t thought of, she’s a great host who will get you what you need. The beds are suuuuuper comfy. Seriously comfy, we wrote down the make and model of both the mattresses and the pillows! We’ll be back! Thanks, Ann!"
