Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Hailee's place while in Columbus for a conference. The place was nice, clean, comfortable and within walking distance of the conference center and German Village. The only issue I had during my stay was Saturday evening when some sort of outdoor concert seemed to be going on in the neighborhood and continued until after midnight. Otherwise it was a quiet, nice stay."

Stayed a few nights",Hailee's place was very convenient to all the downtown action. I felt very safe and secure with all the different codes and fob to get into the building. All the rooms were very clean and modern. I believe the bathroom was somewhat under some updates as the towel holder was not present and none of the outlets worked in there...but all the others in the home worked so it wasn't a big deal. Would definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights",I just want to start off with a HUGE thank you to Haliee and Shan! I had originally rented another Airbnb with a different host and it was a complete nightmare and I almost gave up on my Anniversary trip but Hailee and Shan accommodated my boyfriend and I the same night I got to Columbus and it turned my entire trip back around! The space smelled and looked clean and the bed was so so comfortable! They gifted us with their hospitality and I couldn’t be more thankful. Thank you Hailee and Shan for a 5 Star Stay❤️.

Stayed over a week","Lots of local bars within walking distance. Quick tip about the washer, always put on quick wash and then when it’s finished washing put it on spin mode only to get all of the water out of your clothes. Lastly, for the dryer put it on bulk bedding so that it completely dries your clothes in one setting. Overall a great stay for the price and location. I would highly recommend without any reservations. Hailee was a great host and thanks for having me."

Stayed a few nights","Great value close to downtown. I attended a conference at the convention center and hotels were really expensive due to I’m sure an OSU home game that weekend so this AirBnB, while it required a short drive to the convention center, was still a great value. I appreciated the clear instructions for where to park and how to access the key fob to get into the building. It also includes free parking in a lot across the street which is a bonus in a city."

Stayed one night","I enjoyed staying at this Airbnb, everything was very clean and accessible, with a surprising amount of space (enough to workout). Great location, right around the corner from Little Palace! Columbus-wise, this is a very central location— short drive/cheap uber to anything you need to go to.
Small snacks, coffee/tea, and Brita filter are much appreciated! Plus a very soft makeup removal washcloth. There’s a good amount of closet space to store your personal items out of the way.
There are two key-fob entrances to go through before getting to the unit, which provides additional safety. The lock on the door to the apartment is 4-digit code. There is no deadbolt or additional lock, so I brought a travel lock with me since I was traveling alone. My generic travel lock worked just fine!
Thank you Hailee, I loved your unit! It made me feel right at home. Xx"

Stayed a few nights","The Garden Villa was even better than expected! We were able to totally relax in the area we were in and The Villa seemed to just be a little haven away from the hustle of nearby activities. We had a ton of snow dump on us overnight our 2nd night there which transformed the look to a beautiful winter wonderland. Simon warned us the snow was coming and advised us to park at the top of the hill leading down to The Garden Villa. We heeded his advice and were very grateful for the information. He was extremely proactive and prevented what could have been a difficult situation for us the next day as we were attending a conference in the morning. We are trying to come up with a good reason to visit in warmer weather simply because our stay was so enjoyable! There were so many windows yet we were able to enjoy total privacy once the blinds were closed. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Thank you for making this a great, long weekend Simon. Stay here, you won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed one night","If your looking for a relaxing stay I highly recommend staying at this guesthouse. It’s close to the amenities of Dublin and Worthington, and an easy drive from 270, but still provides a private oasis. The gardens are beautiful, even in the winter, and they provide a peaceful setting.
Simon was great to work with and the suite is luxurious. His listing notes the King bed with a 12 in thick mattress and ThermaRest pillows … I have to say this was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept on. The sheets are super soft too. I also loved the hand soap, a small detail, but it made me feel pampered. This AirB&B is a hidden gem, and I will definitely stay here again."

The host was proactive in making sure we were taken care of and safe, even providing us a different spot to park so we wouldn’t be impacted by an upcoming snowstorm. I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a Romantic getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","A solid 5 start rating is well-deserved in this case. The Villa is exactly as described, super clean and had everything we needed. Simon was the most responsive of all hosts we have ever had. Keep in mind that it is 550 square feet of space - so don't expect something bigger. But, that said it was perfect for us. Everything is high end and well thought out: bed, furniture, decor, linens and towels, tv and all kitchenette accessories. Everything we needed was available. Very quiet and peaceful spot and the right location for what we planned on doing and we will be back for sure. Thanks Simon for providing a memorable experience."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic time! This was our last babymoon trip and we were extremely happy and satisfied with Simon's listing. It was beautiful this time of year but we could only imagine how gorgeous and pretty it is during the blooming months to see all the plants outside and also enjoy the outside amenities. We even saw some wildlife, deer, close by in the side yard. Definitely picturesque! The inside was crisp, clean, and cozy giving off a warm, homey vibe. All the amenities were great, easy to use and high quality.
Location wise, it was easy to get to and very close a big area with restaurants, shopping, malls, etc while also being ~15 minutes away from the downtown. This made it easy to find some delicious food, explore the Zoo's Wildlights and visit COSI.
Simon's communication before, during and faster was fantastic. They made everything so easy and responded quickly.
One of our favorite airbnb's thus far! High recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","A gorgeous and intimate stay for two! My fiancé and I enjoyed a long weekend at The Garden Villa to celebrate our recent engagement. The property is tucked away on the edge of a gorgeous country club surrounded by trees and wildlife. We enjoyed the sounds of birds and other creatures rustling around the leaves during our stay. The inside of the property was absolutely immaculate, by far the cleanest property I have had the pleasure to stay at. The bed was comfortable, the linens were clean, and amenities were easily accessible. The gem of the stay is for sure the outdoor clawfoot tub! What a dream it was relaxing in a private bath outdoor in nature. The host Simon was extremely responsive and offered great local recommendations. The property is equipped with Ring door sensors but it did not feel invasive and did not impact our stay in any way. We would definitely return to this property when in need of a quiet weekend away. Thank you again to the host Simon!"

Stayed a few nights","Simon is the best host we have ever had. This may sound weird, but we grew to love him because of his kindness, attentiveness, patience, good vibes & energy, and how professional he was. He is so inspiring for so many reasons. We had a small wedding ceremony at his villa 10/10, and it was everything we could have dreamed of, plus more. We are still on a high from it all. Simon now has a special place in our hearts forever. He made us feel so special & comfortable the entire time. His photography skills are top-notch. He knows what he is doing.
The Garden Villa is hands down the best airbnb/place we have ever stayed at, and we travel a lot. It's so private & peaceful. Everything was so plush and immaculate. The design of the villa from the inside to the scenery outside is like something out of a magazine SOOO BEAUTIFUL. We loved everything about it!!! We are currently out of town celebrating my wife's birthday & can't stop talking about our experience at The Villa. THANK YOU SIMON ♥️"

Stayed a few nights","This is the first time I have used Airbnb, my husband and I wanted to take a couple days away for our 1 year anniversary. I honestly thought the pictures were too good to be true but The Garden Villa was a dream. I loved walking out every morning to the fountains and the atmosphere. The location is inside the property of a golf course which was odd when we first pulled in, but past that you never think about it. That being said, you will need to drive to go places but we never drove more than 15 minutes. The bridge district and zoo were both close, plus countless restaurants and shops. We are thinking about booking again next year because it was so perfect.
The hosts are very responsive, we had a small issue with the tv remote battery being dead and they came down and fixed it within minutes.
The villa was very clean and the only thing it lacked was a lightning cable on the charger dock provided."

Stayed a few nights","The Villa was just what we needed, a quiet getaway spot. It was easy to check in, and cozy for what we needed.
The internet is there, maybe not the best, but also not the main point of being in such a beautiful spot. And this place is slightly harder than some to get delivery to, but the host has specific recommendations ahead of time for that which worked excellently when we tried it.
Everything was very clean, very comfortable. The bed was super comfortable! They did a good job making such a compact space feel bigger with the high ceilings and lots of natural light (but also the ability to cover most windows, so the best of both worlds). Location is a very short drive to lots of things.
The property is of course very pretty. I’d love to be there a couple of months later when things are fully blooming and also in the snow too. I bet it’s even better.
We would definitely recommend this place to one or two people traveling in the Columbus area! It’s a find!"

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at Simon’s Villa to celebrate a birthday, as we travelled a couple of hours to the Columbus area for a quick getaway. I only needed one night, but paid for the 2 night minimum, as the Villa looked peaceful and gorgeous. I would regularly plan a stay at the Villa, if there was flexibility for a 1 night stay (dang kids)! I did give 4/5 stars for value, only due to how little we were actually at the Villa - if we had stayed at the Villa for the entirety of our time in Columbus, it would have been 5/5, but that logic could be applied to any Airbnb. We hope to return in a few months, just to enjoy more time at the Villa, as the Villa alone would be worth the trip. I was extremely happy with our stay, and Simon was a fantastic host. We had everything we needed, the communication was proactive and very clear, Simon was extremely attentive, and even recommended a great place to stop for lunch in the area. I thank Simon for everything he did to make our stay what I had hoped for & more!"

I've stayed in many Airbnbs but this one is clearly a top choice. We will be back anytime we're in town and I highly recommend you consider this place during you visits too.

Stayed with kids","Simon was easy to communicate with from the very beginning, answering all of our (many) questions. He made finding the address and checking in super easy.
The villa is finished in an exquisite and beautiful way. I’m European and felt as if I was in an Italian garden. We felt right at home. Interior was spotless and just as beautiful, decorated with flair, in a warm and welcoming way. We had snacks and coffee available after our long drive and everything was as described - or possibly even lovelier than the photos.
The area is full of fun restaurants and activities and Simon provided some helpful tips. Check-out was simple and easy.
All in all, we are extremely happy. This was a special treat and we are looking forward to coming back."

The space was meticulously clean and generous amenities were provided; my only reccomendation would to have more towels available in the space when guests check-in. We chose to stay in late-November so some amenities (outdoor tub and grill) were not available due to being winterized. Neverless it was a great stay. Would reccomend Los Guachos tacos 3 miles down the road for a local bite - best tacos I've ever had!"

We only had one towel a piece for the two nights we stayed. As a woman it would have been nice to have a towel to wrap my hair up in after getting out of the shower. Other than that it was a very nice place and I would definitely recommend it be a great spring time get away.

Stayed a few nights","What a lovely villa!! It’s tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin, but still minutes from any and all the fun things you want to do while there. This place has all the amenities you could want! Even a power charging station; a first for us when staying at an Airbnb. The bed and bedding was so comfortable, and the kitchen and bathroom had every amenity you can think of. We had to reach out to our host at one point around 8:30 in the evening because I locked the doorknob which caused the keypad to be ineffective at unlocking our door. He was very gracious and understanding and had us back inside within minutes. The only tip I can offer is the driveway to the villa is a tad narrow, so if you have a large vehicle it might take a moment to leave. But we will definitely consider staying here again when planning another visit to Dublin!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at the Garden. The grounds were beautiful, and the room was clean and upgraded. Simon was a wonderful host and provided information about the area and places to visit. He also answered our questions quickly when we reached out about the claw foot tub.
The only reasons we gave our stay 4 stars instead of 5 was because the room did have a smaller bathroom. Both my wife and I had had difficulties moving around in the space even when we were in there individually. We also think the water was on well water because there was a distinct smell from the water. This isn’t something that they would be able to change though, but I just wanted to provide that information in case anyone else is sensitive to smells like my wife! The other thing that we weren’t a huge fan of was the AC because it was more of a wall mount type. It seemed to take longer to get the space to cool off. There also seemed to be some wifi issues because the television apps ran off wifi and would freeze or skip at points.
Overall, the space truly was beautiful. While we didn’t particularly enjoy Columbus in general for completely unrelated reasons, the one thing we did enjoy was getting to spend quality time together in the Garden."

I do want to mention that there were small planes flying over for a good amount of the evening that we spent there. More of an annoyance than anything. The property also wasn't as well groomed on the outside as it was in the photos, and the parking area is very small. You have to do some maneuvering in order to get out unless you're good at backing up hills.
Overall, a little on the expensive side, but still a great place to stay."

It is extremely quiet, the mattresses are comfortable and relaxing, and the hosts thought of everything! We really appreciated use of the garage and complimentary washer and dryer. The location was perfect for us, and the neighborhood was safe for walks. Even met some neighbors at a garage sale! Great restaurants nearby. Our favorite was Mezzah on Grandview Avenue. Will definitely stay again in the future. Many thanks to our hosts."

I was a little concerned that sharing the bathroom with other guests would be difficult, but I only ran into one of the other guests once, and that was when I was checking out. The neighborhood is quiet, it's on a court so parking on the street is easy. A space heater is provided in case you like it extra warm like me, and boy does that little thing work well! I highly recommend this stay. If you're looking for a clean, quiet, safe and warm home-base kind of place, book here!"

I very much like how there was a glass water jar set up in the bedroom and coffee/tea maker for individual use. I found the place to have everything I need with very simple and easy check in/out.

There is the possibility that there will be other Airbnb'ers there also, so it is possible that there will be 3 guest rooms that share one bathroom. This never posed an issue during my two night stay.
The value is very good, though. Chantal-Marie met me in person when I arrived and showed me to my room. The room was comfortable with a coffee maker and a common microwave in the hall right outside the door. They also have a refrigerator in the kitchen where guests can store stuff. The front door has a keypad so access is pretty seamless. All in all, a good stay."

Regarding the location, it was a little far from the place where the festival took place, but my friends were in a nearby hotel and everything worked out perfectly because I was picking them up by Uber and we stayed at the nearest bus stop and from there it was only $2 for the stadium. Everything was very good in general, the room, the bathroom impeccable. If I go back to the festival from the other year, I would definitely stay again at Chantal."

Everything was as described down to creamer for coffee and even condiments in the fridge. The home was pristine and even my kids said it was the best sleep they’ve gotten in weeks (same for me). We worked on a jigsaw puzzle over the weekend and my kids didn’t even worry about having the tv on. We enjoyed sitting on the patio outside and watching the bumblebees in the flowers. The drive to West Jefferson and even into Columbus was easy! Dorothy gave some suggestions for local eats and even some activities happening over the weekend. It was the perfect weekend getaway from the busyness of life! We would definitely stay again.

The apartment is spacious and comfortable, with a full kitchen stocked with coffee, milk, condiments and many other items. Lots of hot water for showers and luxurious towels were wonderful after a long day of travel. Thank you Dorothy and David for a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","David and Dorothy have curated a lovely and comfortable space in this Airbnb. It was much more space than expected. It is cozy and clean. One of the beds is truly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. My daughter was very pleased with the other one. The area and neighborhood is so nice. It is mid west country living at it finest but is so close to several towns/cities and has very easy access to I-70 between Columbus and Springfield. If safety is a priority in your search or if you are traveling alone, this space, neighborhood, extended area is as safe as one could get, in my opinion. They have thought of everything one could need and more.
Dorothy and David are so warm and personable. The space was private yet we so enjoyed our brief interactions with them. Check in was simple with a key pad and very clear instructions about parking and entry. I hope it is available the next time we are traveling to this area."

Stayed one night","The urban is a nice hotel in a great location. It was very close to short north, northern market and the Ohio state campus. The apartment has a lot of amenities such as a 24 hour gym, a fire pit, and a hot tub. Our least favorite part of our stay was locating the Urban. There is a lot of construction going on around the building so there were detours; We’re not locals and the instructions they gave us were not very helpful. We eventually ended up finding the place and the garage. The room was small, but very nice and includes things such as a tv, a microwave and a refrigerator. The walls were thin, and we could hear people in the rooms near us. All in all, the urban was a nice place to stay in our less than 2 day trip to Columbus."

The only downside is that I think there are also students living here and the walls are quite thin so there was some noise from people talking/laughing around 2-3am each night. Not a big deal if you’re a heavy sleeper but it did wake me up at night.

Dirty utensils, no bowls/spoons/forks, dirty pots/pans, and communal dishwasher made it difficult to cook and prep meals for yourself. Very easy to hear loud guests in adjacent rooms. Room was sufficient otherwise."

I contacted them through AirB&B to see if they could get us some more towels TP but they didn't respond for over a day. We ended up finding a house-service cart and just taking what we needed off of it. Other than that it was good.

Add that parking is included as a huge benefit. Also there is a panera literally steps away - as well as a smoothie place and a few other places to grab a meal/snack. The only challenge i had was that since the rooms are small - the noise from other units at night (after 10 pm) was more than i expected. If you are a sound sleeper it would not be a problem.

However, I had to remind them four times, using three different interfaces, before they finally gave me some money back. Potential guests should be aware that this building is mainly student apartments, but we did not have any issues with that. (Other than a faint smell of marijuana in our room upon arrival.) It is a fun building and very close to OSU."

I followed their instructions exactly how they were given to me and figured it out quickly. Again, the room was very clean and I slept very well as it was nice and quiet. The hot tub was super nice, and it was great to have things so close and extra little amenities. Would definitely stay again."

The room was cute and the building is very clean. It was a perfect fit for an overnight stay."

We had to argue back and forth over whether they would refund me even they I was the one that had to put the cancellation which I think makes it look as if I backed out at the last minute when it was really their bad. I felt bad for the person at the desk I don't think it was their fault but still idk. Not a good situation.

Stayed one night","I will start by saying, we came at a time where there was a lot of construction going on. It was hard to locate the building because it was sandwiched between several other places and kind of hidden. Between it not being an obvious stand out and there being barricades for construction, it was hard to find. Moving to the actual location: The amenities and the floor where our room was, had lots of seating and a very cute aesthetic. Moving to the actual room itself, very very small. This is not the place to stay if you’re coming with more than 2 people and plan to stay for a long period, comfortably. The space consist of a bed, sink, and small bathroom. Not much room for anything extra. We only stayed overnight so it was good for that purpose. Construction woke us up at 6am, which would’ve been nice to know prior to booking. There were HUGE TOENAILS in the AC unit. And it was very hot in the room. Disgusting. But otherwise clean. I’d do it again for one night, nothing longer."

Stayed one night",My husband and I were in Columbus for the evening. Booked this location based on reviews. Something different than our usually downtown stays. Reviews were accurate. Current construction in front of the property made entry a little difficult. Nothing major though. Check-in was a breeze and staff was very friendly and welcoming. You even get a free mini Jeni's ice cream upon arrival :) Nice! Property as described. The rooms are small but clean and comfortable. Everything you need for an overnight stay. The common/kitchenarea on the 6th floor is pretty cool! Found out that part of the building is tenant apartments and part is hotel rentals. Great idea. The only issue we had was parking my husband's truck. AT4 that barely clears the 7 foot entry. Garage clearance got lower each level 6'9/6'10. Talked to the front desk and they were happy to accommodate our vehicle in the first level parking. Overall we had a GREAT stay and would return again. Perfect for our stay and excellent price.

Stayed one night",not a bad spot at all. the price was fair and really easy to check in. the bed was somewhat lumpy due to being a Murphy bed and the walls are super thin. we were able to hear conversation-volume talking most of the evening and morning. I think for a budget traveler this is a fine option but if you want privacy at all consider spending a few extra dollars and get a hotel. overall I would recommend it again to the right guest.

No one mentioned the major construction in the entire front of the building blocking the road. But it didn’t cause any delays or problems for us. Confused us when we arrived is all. Also, the building is 100% like a college dorm but at the same time it was only my husband and I and we had everything we needed and were very comfortable. It was peaceful and quiet for a “college dorm” style. The courtyard with a heated pool is amazing! I would stay again if it was just me and my husband."

We had no problems and didn't need to reach out to the host for anything but I'm sure he would've responded in a kind and timely manner. There were many amenities provided. There were soaps and shampoos and extra linens. All the necessary appliances were included in the kitchen and I appreciated that ground coffee was available to use. It was a short walking distance to all the desirable destinations in German village. There was construction going on during the days but that didn't bother us. Overall we really enjoyed the home and would definitely visit again in the future!

There is some construction next door but Oleksandr was transparent about that from the beginning but we were too busy shopping, sight seeing etc. to really notice it.

House is only a 8 minute Uber ride to Nationwide Arena for events.
The construction was expected and it did not detract from our stay."

The one downside was the construction! I knew about it going in and Oleksandr communicated very clearly about it, but the construction right outside started at 6:20am, and sometimes the street was blocked off by construction vehicles and impassable. Once the construction is finished, I’m sure the spot will be entirely perfect. The decoration was very nice and the kitchen was well-equipped, too."

It is also in the heat of German Village, which is almost like entering a time machine and going back 150 years with its brick streets and old school architecture. Great German restaurants and coffee shops within a couple minutes walk. I would highly recommend!"

It made it a little hard to find the driveway but I wrote them because I was confused and they got back to me immediately. It is a good location and is close to everything. The hot tub was definitely a nice touch.

The location of it in German village was convenient as it was within walking distance of most of the villages popular sites. The only down side was the construction right next to the house which made it inconvenient to get in and out of the house location, along with the noise during the day if you were trying to relax. Over all it was a great experience and would highly recommend once the construction is over."

The hot tub was amazing and it was so nice to just spend time together playing games and listening to records. There was a heavy amount of noise on the Monday morning when we checked out due to the construction next door, but we know is out of there control and they made it clear in the listing as well, so it didn’t bother us but it might some. Overall a great stay, everything was clean, and personal touches around the house made it feel more home-y 🤍 will definitely stay again if we want to explore German village in the future!

Stayed a few nights","This place is tucked away on a private street in a really cute neighborhood that has lots of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops. The hot tub is very nice, has privacy, and operates well. The apartment is well decorated, the climate control works great, and the bed is comfortable, but accessibility-wise, the bathroom is incredibly small (and definitely needs some hooks and towel racks added,) and the staircase up to the bedroom/bathroom has narrow steps and no bannister for the top steps.
Construction is happening across the alley way that is very close to the house, so you can expect noise at 7am on a Saturday from 12 feet away, which we could live with, but weren't thrilled about and would have brought earplugs to deal with. We booked this spot very far in advance, so we were not warned about this until the day of our arrival. The host apologized for any inconvenience, but I likely would not have paid what I paid for this spot knowing it would include a lot of noise."

I didn’t need to reach out about anything because the host sent messages proactively. There was construction going on on the street of the apartment and the host reached out about an alternate way to get there, which was very helpful. Check in and check out was super
easy. In-house instructions were very helpful such as where to find certain light switches, how remotes functioned, etc. Super close to restaurants and shops in German Village. We walked everywhere. All basic immunities were included and adequate but there really weren’t any special touches. It’s not absolutely necessary to go that extra mile, but we have stayed at places that do. I would suggest at bare minimum an addition of a towel rack for the hand towel in the bathroom and ice trays for the freezer."

We have had several experiences in the past where we arrived to find very noisy construction, and we were quite frustrated! In this situation we were informed fully prior to booking, and we decided hot tub won over construction so went anyway. The hot tub is awesome and the construction was surprisingly not very loud, as the house is well insulated. The hosts were very helpful with a few questions in a timely manner. The only thing that could have been improved upon was the kitchen supply, as there are no staples at all such as spices. However, with plenty of tasty places to eat nearby to walk to, we never cooked! Stay here, you will be happy you did!"

Finding it however was kinda tricky but once we did it became second nature. The hot tub was so amazing, well kept, and relaxing. The living room had so much charm and character. It made evenings watching movies on the couch feel so cozy and intimate. The kitchen was spacious , modern, and beautiful. The bed in the bedroom was incredibly comfortable… I wanna know where to pillows came from lol. The walk out balcony was such a bonus and great place to have morning coffee. Bathroom was spotless, clean, and modern. The study was my favorite room. However the ceiling fan light was not connected and the only light available in that room is natural light and a table lamp, which happened to be enough light for me. Again the study had so much charm and character. Thanks for an amazing stay, and allowing us to explore Columbus and what is had to offer!!!!"

Check in was super easy and the host responds quickly and is very helpful if you have any questions!

The hosts were lovely - they were friendly, responsive, and provided us with easy instructions for check in/check out as well as great recommendations for our stay. There are a variety of tasty restaurants nearby for any meal of the day - we chose to drive 5 minutes rather than walk due to the weather but many are definitely at walkable distances. The house is well kept with comfortable furniture. The hot tub was our favorite part of the stay! The fencing allowed for privacy during our soak and we loved the string lights that were hung outside! This was a great little getaway for us, we will definitely consider a return visit if we’re in the area again!"

Since I grew up in this city but have not spent much time in the downtown area recently, we decided to try out German Village. Ashley and Dru have such a terrific place that is very centrally located. The loft is very spacious, modern and comfortable. In fact, this place is one of the nicest places we have found anywhere with airbnb. When we were coming into town, our hosts allowed us enter the apartment early to get ready for all the festivities that we were celebrating. There is even a washer and dryer that was most beneficial to our needs at the time. For those who need to work from home, there is a separate loft with a desk. The kitchen is huge and very well stocked if you need to cook meals while there. A dedicated coffee bar with more kinds of coffee than you could even imagine are included with your stay. This location is so central and perfect for getting all over town!!!"

The place was immaculate. The decor was not overdone — simple but absolutely lovely. There were nice touches everywhere. The handwritten welcome note, cute coasters, and the most concise and easy-to-read house rules book ever. But I particularly loved the embossing on the start of the paper towel and toilet paper rolls-something we have never seen before!
Before you leave town, check out Schmidt’s for dinner (Ashley’s recommendation). Wunderbar!"

Ashley communicated effortlessly with me and answered many questions as well as giving us many recommendations of places to visit. We didn't need to contact her during our stay but we new she was available at any time.

All of our guests were amazed at how gorgeous it was. That night, my husband and I came back to spend the night and celebrate being newly weds! Clearly, this is a very versatile place to stay.

Stayed a few nights","All positive on this stay. Ashley was responsive & friendly (we happened to run into her at one point during our stay). Don’t want to give away too much because her listing is described very well, but we were still very pleasantly surprised by her spacious and well appointed place. Nice touches throughout the loft. We were in town for a volleyball tournament during an extended weekend. Very comfortable and close to the convention center, (just a few minutes away). Many options to dine locally. Easy parking. It sure what else to say. You can’t go wrong here."

Stayed over a week","Honestly this was one of the best airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Pristine, so nicely decorated, fully stocked with high quality, local products. Walking in, I immediately felt like I'd arrived at a home. The apartment is so spacious, with high ceilings and a really nice layout. Ashley is a wonderful host - communicated clearly, and went above and beyond to make sure I had a comfortable stay. German Village is such a great neighborhood, and it's also easily walkable to downtown. Would come back to Columbus simply to have a weekend at this place. Thank you!!!"

Besides for the well equipped loft the two off street parking spots was very nice to have in German Village. Plenty of excellent eats, coffee and drinks that are walking distance to the loft."

Everything you need is right at your fingertips, and the decor is just perfect for a relaxing stay. Everything you need is available in the kitchen and bath. I liked that there were non stick frying pans so I could make my breakfast eggs just the way I like them. The botanical soaps were very nice and smell great. It is super convenient to downtown, and fun to look out at the skyline too. Thanks Ashley for a great stay, can't wait to come back sometime soon."

Stayed one night","Josh’s place was a perfect location for a quick little exploration of Columbus. The house is fabulous… Stunning architecture, super clean, and the softest sheets and the most comfortable bed ever. We always enjoy having the experience of meeting new people and learning a little bit about the area from our host. …Not to mention getting our puppy fix with Juneau."

Every tiny detail is accounted for, from providing a lounge space with a refrigerator right next to the bedroom for convenience, to providing pamphlets and information about the local area, to offering lots of extra towels and complimentary shampoo and body wash. The bed is so comfy, the shower is excellent, and the overhead fan in the room made for the perfect temperature for sleeping. The decor and architecture of the building was also beautiful, parking was easy, and the location was extremely convenient. I hope to stay here again in the future!"

He lovingly restored this home situated in a very quiet, scenic, and beautiful neighborhood. The home has very eclectic, colorful decor and is impeccably maintained. I appreciated the bottled water and his personal welcome. There is a new East Market offering a variety of street food and drink options just a few blocks away. Close to Bexley and downtown Columbus - I highly recommend Josh's home and I look forward to my next stay."

The area is really safe and there is an abundance of parking. Josh goes out of your way to make you feel at home and to use the common areas. The place was super clean and I loved the keyless entry.
Josh also has great recommendations for food and nightlife.
Don’t hesitate to book!"

It’s important to clarify that there is *absolutely* a lock on this bedroom door! I believe a previous guest commented there was no lock - but she just missed it because it is an old fashion skeleton’s key lock.
As a single female traveler I felt absolutely safe the entire time.

Stayed a few nights","This place was not quite as nice as it seemed from the ad, smaller than it looks. The couch itself was extremely uncomfortable, and very cheap.
The bed however was excellent.
Also the hot water is that way too high, scalding hot.
They could've done a better job cleaning, and I think this place would really benefit if the owner stayed here themselves for a weekend or something.
Many little amenities that you would normally expect were not present.
Adding a tall floor lamp in the living room, and a couple extra wastebaskets would go a long way.
There is a Goodwill nearby, the owner could spend about $200 there and completely set this place up. They had several couches that were much better than what was in the unit.
Lots of places to eat in walking distance, a drugstore, gas station, Goodwill, and other things within a block or so.
The air conditioning situation is mixed, with three quality room air conditioners that will totally keep this place cool, but they are a bit"

Stayed a few nights","These hosts have it figured out! I mean who leaves lavender calming mist on the nightstand. Space was meticulously clean and very comfortable. Towels, comforter, bed, blankets (fuzzy btw!), couch were all so comfortable. Not your typical Airbnb ""house showing"" set up. It was like staying at your best girlfriend's house and you end up borrowing her hair dryer, straightener and even her hairspray! I was very appreciative that they thought of all the amenities! They have a guest book with local eats and we used that for every place we ate out. The sushi two blocks down was amazing. It was actually very quiet and private for being so close to a main street. Uber was always only a couple of minutes away too. Like other reviewers have said, the stairs are really steep. Watch your phone on the way down! Oh, I almost forgot the shower head! I mean really, what a nice touch! If ever in Columbus again, I know where we're going back. Thanks Justyn and Grace!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was very accommodating. The decor and complimentary items were a very nice touch. I felt as if I was right at home. The owners went to the lengths to supply a binder with useful information and even had a sign welcoming me to the city. It said, “Welcome to Columbus Erika!” It was a very nice touch and showed me the extra length the owners will take for their guests. The bed was very comfortable!! It was mostly quite and peaceful during my stay. I think the complimentary items such as shower washes, coffee, creamer, feminine hygiene products, and etc. I truly appreciated the cleanliness of the home and the communication through the owners was excellent. I can’t say one negative thing about my stay. I strongly recommend to anyone who is looking for a place to stay. Thank you, again Justin for welcoming me into your home."

Justyn was a prompt and helpful host. I would stay here again if I needed to stay in Columbus again."

Stayed over a week","Either the host double booked my room or he never changed the keypad code for my room. 4 days after staying there someone else used a key code to enter my room while I was sleeping. Then the host said it wasn’t a big deal. I told him I’m contacting Airbnb, he got upset and put me out in the dead of the night. I had to be at work by 630a the next morning. It is not safe there and the host is beyond rude and inconsiderate.
A side from that incident. He has bed beds that have springs and very uncomfortable. A pillow top or memory foam would work best. And lastly there’s so many rules including no shoes, tiptoe through the house, quietly shut your door. Like you’re in boot camp.
Worst Airbnb host ever. Buyer beware."

Stayed a few nights",Host was proactive and sent check in instructions that were clear and easy to follow. Flexible check in. They are strict about the after hours quiet policy as the tenant in the room next door came out to complain when I was moving my stuff in at check in (Saturday around 11PM) even though not much noise was made. Would have been a ding on the review but the tenants were very quiet the entire length of my stay so there are mutual respect and everyone followed quiet hours.

Stayed about a week","Ask what room you are getting first. If it is room 3 or 4 possibly 5. I would cancell immediately. The sound travels hard in that place so when other guests may be going in and out of their rooms and they are not mindful of how they close their door, you will hear this in your sleep. It will wake you.
I say cancel immediately because the host will try and work with you before handing any of your money back even when services have not been rendered. He will keep sending automated messages to you even when you've told him youre no longer staying at his airbnb.
Had to leave the airbnb for other noisy guests not following the house rules (Quiet time and no door slamming). Host wanted me to work with him to kick them out but I am not getting paid for that. So I had to leave in order to not make the situation more unbearable and was a hassle getting partially refunded (even with documentation). I would recommend staying here if you want to trade in peace and quiet for a cheap bargain."

Stayed one night","This is a large home, and it is used possibly exclusively as an AirBnB revenue generator. There are at least 5 bedrooms inside. We were assigned a room. Each has a number and combination lock. The furniture was fun, and it felt very welcoming. We took advantage of the big screen to watch a program we AirPlayed from an iPad, and reclined in the amazing sectional. The kitchen made me wish we'd planned to use it as well. Because there are other guests in the rooms, we mostly all kept to ourselves, so it felt a little ""dorm-like"" hearing other doors open, people wander about, and return to their rooms. We were friendly with those we encountered, but none of them seemed overly friendly. The bathroom was a community affair, which I guess I missed in the mix. It wasn't a problem, but I was left with concerns about conflicts of time usage, since going in and locking the door was the only mechanism for us. Great house, location, and neighborhood overall."

The university campus is close by as well and public transit is easy to access. The beds are very comfortable and I appreciated having ample storage space in the closet. I also absolutely loved having access to a washer and dryer in the house, and the appliances are new and work very well. The other guests were quiet and respectful and the house was kept extremely clean which I really appreciated. The common areas and backyard are set up really nicely, and the kitchen is well-equipped for cooking. The room gets some natural light and there are skylights and lots of windows in the house. Check in and check out were both easy and the host was accessible and very easy to communicate with. All in all this airbnb was great for my needs."

Maybe it was just too cold outside that day that it caused that particular problem but we will just blame it on the cold weather. nevertheless, if they ever come back to visit or anyone else I know comes to Columbus and needs a place to stay, I will recommend this lovely house. thank you so much 😄"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing place to stay, the host was absolutely lovely. It’s in a quiet part of town just a bit outside of the city. Had plenty of restaurants to chose from nearby. The room was very welcoming and clean. We felt very safe our entire stay. You could really tell the host put a lot of work into maintaining the cleanliness in the room and making sure all guest were happy with their stay, would absolutely book to stay here again!"
