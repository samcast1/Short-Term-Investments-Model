Stayed with kids",Lovely little home. Tons of stuff to do within a hour of the house. Unfortunately it was raining while me and my family were there but the yard looked like it was nice to relax in and have a fire. Mike had a binder that explained everything clearly and has photos for all the items in the house to assist you. The parking spot also has a carport which was very nice as it was raining while I was there

The place its self was very clean and was very accommodating for my family of 5. I highly recommend staying here if your looking to spend some time with everything Hershey has to offer.

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed a long getaway weekend in Mike’s bungalow. It was centrally located to the activities I had planned. (10 minutes to Lebanon Valley College, 20 minutes to Hershey.)
Mike’s bungalow is charming and cozy and includes all the essentials. It even includes a wireless phone charger, reclining chair and sofa, and a gas fireplace, which not only creates a nice ambience, but can heat the entire home.
Mike was very responsive and helpful when I had questions/concerns. I also appreciated Mike’s friendly neighbor who helped with the pilot light in the fireplace. Mike provided a basket of pamphlets which included menus and local attractions. Martino’s Italian Traditions is a highly recommended restaurant down the street! He also provided a binder complete with instructions, directions and maps. Very helpful. I enjoyed the fall foliage on the rail trail.
The bungalow is updated and nicely decorated. Mike is a great host. Highly recommended.
Thank you, Mike, for sharing your home."

Stayed with kids","Myself, my husband, and our three children had a great stay at Mikes place while we vacationed and visited Hershey park for the first time. Being a family of 5, we prefer more of our own space when we travel vs. a hotel and this space was just right for our five day stay. We felt just as comfortable as if we were in our own home. Everything was fresh and clean as well as clear instructions posted from start to finish. We did not once run into any complications. There was a complimentary bowl filled with chocolates and water bottles waiting for us when we arrived. Mike was quickly responsive to any messages and questions leading up to our stay. Definitely recommend for your next family trip!!"

Stayed with kids","The house was extremely clean and welcoming. Clean sheets, towels, coffee k-cups all provided. Nicely remodeled with new appliances - including the washer and dryer.
If you are a light sleeper be aware that the main road is right by the house and has a lot of traffic — all night. Made it pretty hard to sleep.
If traveling with several people the 1 fairly small bathroom is a little hard to navigate."

Host was great at communicating directions ahead of time, so we didn't have any issues getting there or with our stay.

Stayed about a week","Five Stars for giving us such a great home-away-from-home experience.
The location was very convenient for our visits to Annville.
After visits in bustling areas we came home to an inviting cottage
with a lovely front porch and quiet, well-kept neighborhood which feels
peaceful and safe.
The home is very well lit and offers ample covered
driveway parking right by the front door. Very easy to use
keyless entry mechanism, too.
We found the bed comfortable and the living room restful.
The recliner sofa was especially appreciated.
The kitchen is full sized and fully equipped with nice dishware and new
appliances. Plus, the dishwasher and washer&dryer are very quiet.
You can run them and still enjoy the TV or sleep.
These hosts are readily available. On our one occasion to call them
our call was returned immediately.
In closing, we hope you can tell we found this place
a great vacation refuge!"

There was plenty of space for us and we were able to have three people over for dinner with plenty of space for every one to sit. The outside area is amazing. We were excited to use the charcol grill for cooking for family. We sat out side and let the baby play. The beds were super comfy and everything we needed was there. The pictures don't do this place justice. It's truly beautiful! We look forward to booking again!

Stayed with kids","We loved our incredible stay at The Lodge! From the time we pulled in to when we walked in the door, we were blown away from the beauty of both inside and outside of the cabin and for a great price! It was much cheaper to stay here than anywhere in Hershey or Harrisburg. This was our first time anywhere in the area so we were not familiar with Myerstown. We loved it! Close to grocery stores. A perfect half way point to Strasburg, Hershey, Harrisburg and Reading which was perfect for us since we visited all of those. I got a message not too long before we arrived, that the pack n play was set up for us for our littlest one. Very nice we did not have to worry about that. They had plenty of board games and puzzles to keep our older kiddos busy. Also scooters and balls for outside. And we loved the devotions in the cabin to read to our kiddos, we took a picture to buy them for our home. We loved the no tv to have time together. We would definitely love to stay here again!"

She answered all of my questions right away, and made the experience down right superb. The Lodge was clean and felt homey and even thought it rained all day for 1 of the days, we played games and ate like kings! Thank you also Miriam for the delicious cookies you left for us. It was a nice extra touch I missed her email asking if we arrived okay, but that was because we were preoccupied with the whole experience. I had no need to be in contact with her through our stay because everything was just as we were told and shown. Thank you so much for allowing us to stay, and we would definitely do so again."

Group trip","Our stay at the Country View Lodge was great! The lodge is beautiful and the location is lovely--wooded lot and quiet. What was especially appreciated on our rainy weekend was the fact that we could back right up to the garage door to unload and load our luggage because, with five ladies on a girls' weekend, there was a lot of luggage. There were fresh cookies waiting for us on the kitchen counter and juice drinks in the frig. The fireplace was delightful for the chilly, damp evenings. Overall the lodge is a great place to stay and we would highly recommend it! We would love to stay there again sometime when we could take advantage of the inviting firepit in the backyard. Thank you, Miriam, for responding so quickly any time I sent you a message and for providing such a lovely place to stay!
Sincerely,
Sandy P."

Group trip","I have stayed at many wonderful Airbnbs, but even so, Miriam and her place were exceptional. We arrived at her place a day late after having had to pull over for the night during a terrible rainstorm. Miriam was very understanding and encouraging as we tried to navigate our arrival at the end of a long and difficult road trip. We arrived in the morning, somewhat the worse for wear, and found her place a beautiful, welcoming sanctuary.
The house is beautifully appointed—she's thought of everything and it was very easy for our family to stretch out, feel comfortable, and rest. Lovely, peaceful neighborhood and property with a great porch, gorgeous trees, and a number of outdoor seating areas.
When we needed to extend our stay for a day, she was again flexible, accommodating, and gracious. It was a challenging weekend for us in several respects and Miriam's kind and thoughtful hospitality was a great blessing to us. I hope we have occasion to stay with her again. Highly recommend."

When we arrived there were cookies waiting for us which my family enjoyed. We enjoyed going onto the deck through the bedroom and having some of the delicious complimentary coffee. The bathrooms were nice and roomy stocked with plenty of towels,wash cloths, a few rolls of toilet paper. The beds were so comfy. We loved all of the decor as well as the lights through and around the property. There is a basket ball hoop, a lovely outdoor area with picnic tables and a fire pit.
Plenty of seating to be able to enjoy the surroundings. We saw quite a few horse and buggies pass by even while we drove. There was a folder that had local food recommendations and supermarkets near by. Hershey park was about 45 mins away but we enjoyed being away from
The city areas. The appliances gave a nice rustic touch. We did not want to leave. I would looove to stay here again soon."

We wanted a central hub to these locations so we didn’t have to check in and out of hotels and could just relax every evening. This house fit our needs and then some! The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking and was very nicely decorated. The bathrooms were very clean and had plenty of towels. The washer/dryer was a huge plus with 6 of us and had supplies in case we didn’t have any. The bedrooms were clean and had plenty of space for our group with room to spare. Having a grill on the patio for burgers, a basketball hoop to play with the kiddos, and an awesome front porch with swing allowed us to enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Miriam was a super host and was very responsive. Miriam was very sweet and even stopped by to give us some cookies/tea (yum!) for a welcoming gift! Would absolutely stay again! Thank You!"

Although among farmland, there’s easy and quick access to town and the interstate. It’s a great spot for visiting Lancaster and/or Hershey or to have to private time.
The kitchen had everything we needed (and a grill on the deck). The bathrooms were clean. Miriam even left fresh baked cookies and some Hershey kisses for us.
Miriam was responsive to our questions, provided a little guidebook of places to eat and see, and checked in on us.
If we go back to the area, we would stay there again. Wonderful place and hosts."

Home was very spacious for relaxing , eating space, and privacy if needed. We especially loved all the outdoor seating areas. There were 4 adults and our 10 yr old grandson who thoroughly enjoyed the “ kids cave” bedroom! He was even able to ride the scooters around outside and in the basement when it rained one night. It was very clean, plenty of kitchen items for cooking/eating. Adorable and stocked coffee / tea nook, beds were all comfortable! Air conditioning was great for self- adjusting in each bedroom. Bathrooms were spacious, plenty of outlets for drying hair etc, and very clean. Beautiful area and property! Fire pit cozy and great for roasting marshmallows! We will definitely return. Oh and only 35 minutes from Hershey! 5 STARS for sure!! Ohhh snacks in fridge and a lovely plate of homemade cookies when we arrived! Thanks, Miriam!"

In fact, it's even better in person. The front porch is the first welcoming spot and it just gets better once you enter the house. So many amenities...too many to list. Miriam is definitely a super host, as nothing is overlooked. Most rentals do not have garages but the Lodge does, which was a welcome surprise in this cold weather.
Everything is immaculately clean, all the rooms are spacious but still cozy, every space is well appointed and welcoming.

Trying to find a place to stay that is accommodating for our son's wheelchair is next to impossible. The house is very roomy inside, along with the master bedroom and bathroom. He was able to maneuver through the house very easily. We would definitely stay here again if we are ever back that way."

The house was very tastefully decorated, and so many fun things to do both inside and outside for the kids! The kitchen is very large (the pics didn’t do it justice, we did not realize how large it would be!) It was stocked with everything you might need for daily meals; condiments, coffee choices, tons of cookware, plates, bowls, even zip lock bags to store left overs if needed! The back yard looked like so much fun for the summer time! Unfortunately it was chilly while we were visiting, but still would have been lots of fun! The bathrooms were so clean, and we all couldn’t help but notice the very clean smell of the linens when we got into bed the first night! The beds were super comfortable, and rooms were spacious! We loved everything about our stay at Kyle’s- highly recommend and will use again!!"

There is truly not one negative thing I have to say! The fenced in backyard was awesome. It was private and you would never know others have had their pets there before. The attention to detail throughout the house made you feel at home. Such a unique place that is 1000% worth every single penny!! Kyle was an awesome host and he was great to talk with.

Stayed with kids","Kyle went above and beyond: our stay was threatened by the terrible wildfire smoke in 2023. He brought in air filters and had them running long before we arrived with our friends and their young child. Although we were stuck inside for most of the stay, Kyle's accommodation and the great amenities in the space helped us have a great time."

We enjoyed all the extras like the hot tub & pool, Pac-Man game, popcorn machine, and picnic table. Kyle was very friendly and responsive via the app chat and provided great local recommendations for restaurants. The house is a short drive to Hershey Park where we spent our days immersed in people, rides and fun. At night we were able to retreat to the quiet neighborhood and enjoy family time. We highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Kyle’s “red door retreat” was nothing short of excellent. The attention to detail in the decor, the details of what to do and where to find things via iPad by the front door was so helpful. The yard was truly a peaceful retreat for the entire family to rest after a day out. They left no detail behind when they thought of what someone staying would want and need. The home comes equipped with everything from soap and little toiletries around the house, to a s’mores kit for the fire pit.
Truly remarkable what a SUPERhost like Kyle put together to ensure remarkable memories are made when your a guest of his. Thanks again!"

We took a visit with our 2 babies for the weekend and it was an excellent experience from the moment we booked to even after check out! Kyle was awesome. We let Kyle know we’d be arriving late at night, so he made sure to leave lights on for us. The house was absolutely spotless and the recommendation he provided for spots for dinner were great! He thought of every detail to make sure we were comfortable and it really felt like we were just at home. After check out, we left a personal item behind at the house and Kyle said he would mail it to us. So unbelievably nice and appreciated. Thank you so much for everything Kyle. We can’t wait to stay at more of your homes and looking forward to our next getaway with you as our host!"

We planned so many of our activities and places to eat from recommendations from Kyle and they were all amazing. This is the one main thing I really enjoyed and appreciated because I am a planner and it made it so much easier from looking through this. The home was beautiful and I would def. 10/10 recommend.

Every little detail, was amazing, it had something for everyone and for all ages! My preteens were never bored and never touched their electronics the whole stay, amazing! We loved the pac man game, the record player, which was my sons favorite by the way, the popcorn machine, my daughters favorite, and the hot tub was a must after a long few days at Hershey Park, which was only 30 mins away! The house was exceptionally clean and had everything we needed, plus some! Our favorite was sitting by the fire, having s’mores and playing games. We can’t thank Kyle enough for his generosity! We will be back. 😄"

Stayed with a pet","I can't say enough positive things about Kyle and the Red Door Retreat. Our family had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Red Door. My two kids (13 and 8) enjoyed the house so much that we ended up spending 2 of our 3 full days there just hanging out and enjoying the pool, hot tub, board games, and my son's favorite - the PacMan arcade game. They LOVED having the gumball machine and hot popcorn from the classic popcorn machine. The pool was the perfect size for my 8 year old to swim in circles or for all of us to just sit in and cool off. The hot tub was also a favorite. Everything was immaculately cleaned. The beds were super comfortable and there were so many thoughtful touches around the house that we didn't have to worry if we forgot to pack something. Kyle quickly responded to any questions we had and was incredibly gracious as well. We spent one day at Hershey Park which was an easy 30 minute drive away. Kyle had several suggestions of local places to visit that we were going to try out but we enjoyed the amenities at the house so much that we ended up hanging out there 2 of the days during our visit. You can't go wrong with booking this house. We look forward to visiting his other properties in the future as well."

Stayed with kids","This home was easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had. Here’s why:
1- The home is beautiful, immaculately kept, and well-stocked with everything from basic toiletries, kitchen supplies, and lots of supplies for children including play pens, board games, a popcorn machine, and a s’mores kit.
2- Aside from all of the indoor amenities, including a tv in almost everyone room and a large tv to go with the oversized comfy couch, there is a spacious yard with a hot tub and a small pool. On cool April nights the hot tub was the perfect way to wind down after days taking kids out for the Hershey and Lancaster activities.
3- The home is centrally located between Hershey and Lancaster. There are tons of activities nearby, including Hershey Park, farm tours, and surprisingly good wineries and breweries.
4-Red Door Retreat is one of the most organized Airbnbs I’ve experienced. Kyle put together a wonderful App that has answers to every question you may have and recommendations for restaurants and activities. In addition, Kyle was a pleasure to communicate with and really went the extra mile to make sure we had all we needed every step of the way."

Hands down THE best Airbnb home we have ever stayed at...and that is exactly what you get when you stay at Red Door Retreat...a home. 100% exceeded our expectations! I don't know what more I could possibily add to what everyone else has already said about Kyle's place but I feel he, his cleaning lady and Red Door Retreat deserve it! Walking into a warm, inviting and well lit home in the evening set the stage for our wonderful staycation. Not only does the list of amenities go on and on but the list of extra little things that you might not think of does as well. We did not want for anything!!! The oversized couch and board games were a huge hit! I highly recommend ""Oodles"" to anyone about 20 yrs or older...totally appropriate, a fun & hysterical walk down memory lane!! The well lit, fenced in, private backyard was fantastic! The quaint neighborhood with sidewalks was wonderful to walk our dog in. As for Kyle's cleaning lady....A+++++!!! Everything was cleaned & disinfected from top to bottom, it was spotless! I wish all cleaning companies were trained by you! ;) Kyle was always courteous, kind and helpful throughout our stay, a perfect host! I was excited to hear he has other listings!

Stayed with kids",The red door retreat was the perfect getaway. Kyle had the house decorated for Christmas and it was centrally located to Hershey Park and Amish country. The neighborhood was family friendly and the house was equipped with everything you would need to make you feel at home. My children loved the red door retreat and Kyle was the perfect host. He was readily available whenever I needed to ask a question. I would definitely recommend this location for your next family getaway.

Stayed with kids","From the moment I booked this place until I checked out - the communication was awesome with the host. Always kind, courteous, and hospitable. I couldnt ask for anything more from the host. When my stay came up, driving up to the property, we came in late and it was inviting even walking up to the door, the property was in a nice neighborhood, well lit and walking in on a cold windy night we were greeted not by a property, or a rental but a home. It was a relief to get in there and get settled. You could tell right away the time, effort, and care that went in to preparing this place. There are so many little touches that made this place special and delight to stay in. Even for me and my family of my wife and three kids all under 7, everywhere you looked there were gentle touches the place was IMMACULATELY cleaned, there were no odors. Two of the beds were memory foam, another was spring, the linens were fresh, there was a washer dryer on prem. Now the home's age was on par for the neighborhood but this home had undergone a lot of updates. The house was beautiful, and charming. I had seen before where hosts would gussy up one part of the house then maybe half-ass another part - not the case here. Every square inch of the house had the same amount of love and attention, the back yard was a private oasis in an of itself. In a suburbia, it was well fenced in and private with the pool (closed as I visited in december), hot tub, I saw yard games on the side of the house, fire pit. So many thoughtful things - I could have spent my whole vacation just in this house (I had other plans already). Thoughout my vacation in the area my kids kept asking me ""when are we going back to popcorn house?"" in reference to the popcorn machine in the living room of Red Door Retreat. This house had everything we needed and could ask for. We did have a problem during our stay - one of my kids locked a door from the inside and closed it so I had to contact the host - the response was near instant and they came right by to open the door up. Very gracious and hospitable through and through. I cannot wait to check out other properties from this host, and if I ever venture to this area again I will be sure to check if Red Door Retreat is available again.
Book this place if you can, you wont regret it!"

The backyard is so cute... it was a little cold to enjoy it (although the hot tub was nice in the cold air) so I hope to come back again in warmer weather."

We absolutely loved the s’mores kit! Once I saw the record player with Stevie Nicks and Lana Del Rey… I knew I instantly was going to LOVE it there! Best part was allowing our fur baby to stay with us which is a huge deal in our family!
Thank you Kyle for a wonderful stay and for your prompt responses! ❤️❤️❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Where shall I start.... I have always wantedto stay at this home. it is marked as a favorite of mine on my boards. Well it did not disappoint!!! From the moment we entered I fell in love with this home. Everything in this beautiful home is amazing. From the furniture, the decor, the appliances , the amenities, the backyard, the pool, hot tub , all the extra little things that others don't offer. And the owner is amazing. He had snacks and a smore station for nighttime campfires waiting there for our boys, he was very quick to help with anything and everything . Kyle even had a Ipad there for use on everything to do with the home inside and outside.. Recommendations on restaurants, grocery stores, activities. You name it Kyle had it covered.. all the linens are provided, bathroom amenities ,toiletries, kitchen is absolutely fully stocked with every and anything you need even cleaning supplies. Nice little personal touches like hershey kisses left on every bed, top of the line coffee maker and the coffee and amenities to go with, ice maker, wine chiller, brand new appliances , games to play, gumball machine,, top of the line entertainment system ,tvs in every room,, the list goes on and on. The neighborhood is out of story books,even the neighbors were amazing. The house was absolutely spotless. Not a single speck of dirt to be found, everything top to bottom is cleaned and disinfected and trust me I know I am a clean freak!!! My family and I hated to leave. Kyle and his home are absolutely the best . This by far has been my best experience not only the beautiful home but the host as well. I would highly recommend you go and stay in a little piece of paradise. We've already booked for next year!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","The Red Door Retreat was a perfect little oasis for a girls weekend getaway. We all fell in love with the decor inside & out, which is all tastefully done. (We all want to hire Kyle to come design our own homes!) While we enjoyed exploring local wineries, I highly recommend planning a day or half day/evening to stay in and enjoy the home. We went the extra mile and hired a personal chef to come in for the day to cook us an amazing dinner on-site which really made the trip one of a kind!
Kyle was incredibly attentive and readily available throughout our stay (and leading up to arrival). His mom even popped over to make sure the chef made it in ok in case we weren’t there when he arrived. I would have loved to meet him & hear the stories behind the decor and personal touches found throughout the home.
10/10 would recommend!"

Stayed with kids","We have a tradition of taking our grandchildren to a special place to honor their becoming a teenager when they turn 13 years of age. My wife picked your place after scouring a lot of places listed online. Your reviews were glowing and the pictures inviting. We were not disappointed. It was a special place that we and our grandson enjoyed immensely. He could not wait to tell his parents about where he stayed. Your pictures were so inviting that our youngest daughter invited herself and her best friend to come along. We loved the house and the back yard. Your communication was the best we have ever experienced. Our only complaint was there was only a two day window to rent your place, which is a product of it's popularity. We wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you for hosting us."

Stayed with kids","Every year we take 3 of our grandchildren on a vacay adventure. This year we chose to go to Hershey. In looking for a place to stay we found on Airbnb, The Red Door Retreat in Lebanon was just the ticket. Convenient to Hershey and other attractions of interest. . The pictures on the Airbnb site looked like it would be a really sweet place. That is an understatement, it was AWESOME.. The minute we walked in the door, we were totally impressed. The house was spotless, the décor was eclectic and fun. and the back yard was like a little spot of happiness.. Our pet was welcomed and a child safety gate on site was perfect to put him in the kitchen area while we were away from the home. Little touches of kindness were all over the house. We enjoy our little trips with the kids, and if ever we go back to Pennsylvania rest assured we know where we hope to stay again... Kyle is a super host, and you can tell he takes pride in making guests feel special."

I was looking for a place to get away for a nice quiet weekend to celebrate my birthday safely and I stumbled upon this adorable retreat only a few hours away from my home. From the moment I saw the pictures I knew this was the place I wanted to stay. As soon as I walked in the front door it was everything I expected and more! The place was extremely clean and made me feel safe to stay there for the weekend. All the amenities listed (hot tub, fire pit, games, etc) were exceptional and definitely were exactly what we needed. The cherry on top was the superb service Kyle provided since before we even step foot in the house! He was very helpful in accommodating an early check in (even though we didn’t end up arriving until late) and was amazing at making himself available to check in on us during the stay. He went above and beyond as I mentioned it was my birthday and I walked in to find a whole birthday cake he had gotten for me! I was so surprised and couldn’t be happier! The level of host service provided by Kyle was exceptional and I wish every property I stay at could be hosted by him!

Group trip","Kyle, Kyle, Kyle😁🎄❄
Where do I start... pulling up to your house🏠, walking up to the house, walking into your beautiful home🎄❄ you should've seen the looks on my kids faces, it was literally priceless... (literally commercial material) the things they were saying, look at the decorations, my daughter is like I can't wait until the lights come on⛄ the red door, the signage, the rabbit, the plaque... both kids were like mom, do you see this sign: those who trespass will be killed and eaten😮🙂 when the 'door' opened I'm pretty sure I heard a gasp😁 they were thoroughly impressed, as was I... which is hard to do, especially with 2 of them 14 and 11yrs, lol🤣 Everything from the tree, to the TV, to the gumball machine (hugh hit) was really just wonderful, all the intricacies are amazing, you would notice different things everytime you went somewhere in the house inside and out... initially we didn't see Hi, I'm Mat, haha... it was funny to see each person pick up on things. The hot tub and firepit were easy to operate and just great!! The Alexa, the kitchen itself... O my goodness, the smell(s), totally worth the efforts you put in, we were wonderfully engulfed when we entered and transitioned from room to room🎄😊🥧🎉 I apologize I meant to go back to the survey. .. I feel like everything was comfortable, inviting, and just right. My husband said yes! to the king bed, lol😴🧔 the guide book was fantastic, I truly carried it around with us to the ice machine, the back door, the spa. I cannot apologize enough for the parking situation. We loved your bit Emoji directional display... it was like we were so excited we didn't fully take everything in at once. You've masterfully created an experience. You do not have to leave the house. We watched movies, played Christmas music, constructed gingerbread houses, made hot chocolate and of course, s'mores. I day dreamed of the possibilities in warm weather🏖 geezo!! The lighting... the couch!! The peek/ walk through, so unique wonderful touch, beautiful architecture.... I hope and cannot image if you are not a famed super hero interior decorator and beyond, you facilitated our entire experience without physically being there... I mean 'Superhost' is an understatement. The kids were like the furniture (the space the couch is in particularly) seems like it fits so perfectly for each space and room... yup, that's beyond skills, beyond an eye😊 The elf, the games, the books... the first thing we did was read one of the books in the sweetest little back room I may have ever seen (one of children is 3yrs), the robots, the bookshelf, the perfectly sized and appointed everything (another hugh hit), the hot tub also was a fav!!!! I could go on for a weeks time to say everything I could say and I certainly will be.. the word of mouth you and your property will receive from this mouth.. I have been singing your praises (in which I shouldn't mention I am tone deaf🤣) 🎶 Thank you Kyle❤
Sincerely,

Kyle added a wonderful touch of having a s’mores making kit for our kids which they loved making around the fire pit. He also provided us with information on the surrounding area to give us ideas on activities and places to visit. You will not regret staying at the red door retreat!!

Kyle was super patient with us city girls who knew nothing about fire pits or grills, and answered all of our questions immediately. I cannot recommend this place enough!!!

Stayed with kids","Wow! What a nice place to get away. This home was spotless and we felt comfortable that new CDC cleaning guidelines were being followed.
Kyle's hospitality was top notch! The inside of the home is very nicely decorated with some really fun touches that my family enjoyed. The kitchen is well appointed and sparkling. The popcorn maker made movie night really special and the gumball machine kept the kids chewing!
The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable, and the upstairs bathroom was clean and very functional.
We spent a lot of time outside using the plunge pool and the lounging furniture. There's even a tiny garden! The fenced-in yard was perfect for our small dog, and the neighborhood is quaint and walkable and felt very safe.
Downtown Lebanon was not the highlight of our trip, but I would recommend Wertz's candy shop which was unique and well stocked, with everyone abiding by new covid regulations. The candy is all pre bagged to make it even safer!
Kayaking on the Swatara River through Cocoa Kayaks was a lot of fun too.
Kyle was great with all the communications making reservations, check in and check out seamless. The house is equipped with programmable locks making no keys necessary! Highly recommend!!"

Group trip","As the decision maker for my family I am always afraid the I might not pick the best vacation location. I honestly research till I am exhausted. Well if you are like me stop, I will tell you that you cannot go wrong with the RED DOOR RETREAT. First Kyle is super detail oriented, so you do not have to chase him for door codes or set up because he tells you before you even ask. The house honestly is PERFECT. Kitchen has a great Keurig machine with both brew and k cup capabilities. The refrigerator, washing machine and dryer are modern appliances. He also has an ice making machine which is cool. All appliance are so clean. All utensil you can possibly needed. The bathroom has everything you need (ladies EVERYTHING) including a great shower head. The living has a great big TV with all the channels and subscriptions you can watch. The dining room is also very well set up and gorgeous. The Backyard has a great pool for cooling off and a fire pit perfect for the night. The grill is perfect, and he made sure the tanks where full and ready to use. I honestly can go on and on. The location is perfect. Don't second guess yourself book it. I honestly loved everything about this house."

The house itself is amazing- its bright, airy and beyond immaculate. Just walking in the door you can tell the house is tended to with care. The pictures really don't do this place justice. Its adorable and perfect for a relaxing getaway, that still feels homey. We lucked out with sunny weather so we were able to take advantage of the unique plunge pool. Its the perfect amount of pool to keep you cool while the sun is hot but to still be able to hangout and relax. Kyle thought of everything to have handy for your stay- from the kitchen, bathroom and everything in-between. The location is convenient, it is close to the supermarket and wine. We will definitely come back here for another amazing stay."

I like the location, and her photo of the well lit porch is a great landmark, making it easy to find. The story of the house, the murals on the walls, the relaxing atmosphere all are very intriguing. Come and stay to find out why."

The surrounding area was peaceful, and we enjoyed a nice hike with our pup on the nearby Lebanon Valley Rail Trail that was recommended. Communication with Stephanie was great, access to the room was a breeze thanks to the keypad, and she was kind enough to accommodate an earlier check-in. We'd definitely stay here again if we come through this way in the future. Thanks again, Stephanie!"

The 2 beds and 2 sofas were enough to accommodate us. The bathroom had everything we needed, and was clean. There is a park across the street, and as we packed our stuff in the morning, the kids were able to go play which was cool. The extra sitting area with kitchen/dining room allowed us to close the door and enjoy our coffee while the kids slept. There was also wifi so we could do a little work, or use the internet to plan our day. We did notice, as we were leaving, that the house is situated in a cool, historic area which would have been nice to explore... Stephanie was friendly in her proactive communications... We would definitely recommend this place..."

It was plenty big enough for 4 people, maybe more? The bathroom is tight so only one person can be at the sink at a time.
It was clean and tidy. I didn't have trouble finding the house but I wasn't sure which door was for the room and had to ask for directions. The entry was super easy.
There is a bit of road noise during the day and the traffic on the road moves faster than it seems like it should. At night, it's very quiet."

Stayed with a pet","It was right across the street from a school playground, and it was perfect to stay in with toddlers. We had some trouble getting in because the keypad wasn’t working properly, but the host was immediately responsive to my messages (albeit incredulous that there was an actual problem and not just my misunderstanding) and solved the problem promptly. Amenities were great—air conditioner, heater, clean mini fridge, coffee, tea, microwave. Attractive, comfortable space."

Stayed a few nights","We usually stay at a local campground when coming to this area, but decided to try something different this year. We enjoyed our stay. There was plenty of space for the two of us - and it was private, too. The mattresses were very comfortable. The shower was small (as others noted) but the shower head is detachable so it wasn’t a problem. There was a nice selection of various shampoos to use. The occasional road noise (that other reviews mentioned) was eliminated on our second night by using the window air conditioner. The bathroom nightlight was appreciated. The refrigerator was also nice to have - as was the coffee bar with a Keurig machine, coffee pods, mugs, etc. Also, it was convenient that the outlet between the beds had USB ports for phone charging. Finally, this is a very good location for enjoying the nearby walk/bike trail and for events at the Mount Hope Estate and Winery."

Stayed a few nights","The space was very attractive and spacious, consisting of two separate living areas. The bedroom area was also the main living room with couches (yes, two), TV, and coffee table/end tables. The second living area was a couple of steps up to it from the main room and was another living room and a dining room. It included a good sized mini-fringe, microwave and Keurig coffee maker. But, with the lack of a kitchen, it seemed a bit odd to not have a kitchen itself (sink, etc). The two beds were very comfortable. The bathroom and stall shower were pristine in every way, though a tad small in space. I highly recommend that guests read the house rules and instructions in the notebook on a credenza in the main room. I pulled in late for my meeting with family and rushed out without being able to read it. The lock mechanism to lock it when you leave is not intuitive and not included in the email instructions"

Family lives there but our area and theirs was private. There was hot water. I noticed how one review said there wasn’t any hot water. I had no issues with that. Only one suggestion would be to have a few bottles of water in fridge or a pitcher of water would be awesome. The only access to water was bathroom however the water quality was great! Tasted great! Was very relied that water was drinkable as I was out of our bottled water after a very long drive. Was quiet even though located on a main road.

We will definitely be back to enjoy this beautiful space and see what else the area has to offer. The only recommendation, we have is adding shades to large windows, directly in front of the bedroom. The view is beautiful, however the sun is very bright in the morning. Other than that, EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect. ❤️"

Reserved parking spots were available within 1 block, which was so helpful because we were in and out a lot.
The location was a short drive to Hershey, where we went for Spa appointments and shopping.

Stayed a few nights","This loft is AMAZING! It is super cozy and very modern with a twist of original architecture. Using the old school elevator to go up to the loft was like going back in time & was one of my favorite things to do! The views from the windows are very nice at night and in the morning with the sun is rising. I must say it’s very noisy. You have constant cars speeding through the roads and you have emergency vehicles blaring their sirens at all times of the day and night. The train that’s a few blocks away also comes through multiple times a day and night blaring its horn. There isn’t much to do around there so if you’re just looking for a place to escape and just get away from life and stay in for a few days, this is the perfect place! The host literally provides everything u need & are very responsive. All you would have to do is go for a small grocery run and you’re set! Overall minus the noise, my wife & I definitely enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed the loft."

Stayed a few nights","This place was exceptional in every way. Once you are inside you never want to leave it. The town is quite a depressed area but Joya’s is truly an oasis. We were there as it was quite close to a lacrosse tournament and what we were able to retreat to in her loft was magical. However, I would not find myself in Lebanon for any other reason than this so I wonder who might come to stay there and for what reason BUT if you have a reason to be in that area, this is the most incredible find. It felt like we were in our own home: everything we could possibly want in a kitchen, the TV, a speaker for music, a very comfortable king bed. She has thought of everything, including earplugs as there is a train and street noise. It was really such a cool space. The entrance is shady but immediately inside the door on the street level is a locked hallway and an old elevator lift that is private. After that, you’ll never want to go back down to the street. It is even better than the photos."

We found many surprises in every room of the house.

Jessica’s communication weeks before check in and throughout our stay were very responsive and helpful! The local coffee and downstairs play area were a huge hit.

it was late when I realized that I hadn’t booked anywhere to stay and I didn’t even know if I would get a response from the host but Jessica responded right away and communicated with me as my husband drove to her home
she was so kind and helpful to give me advice on planning our next day at Hershey park and gave great tips which came in very useful she was also very knowledgeable of all the resources in the surrounding area so we had a good idea of what was available to us before we even needed it
Her home was clean and clutterless and was set up too accommodate ever age group
we enjoyed staying at Jessica’s so much that we are hoping to stay again and visit HP before it closes for season"

From the backyard swing set, to the theater room everyone had something to do! We enjoyed it here that we regret not spending an extra day just to enjoy the home, as we were here to go to Hershey park, that’s only about 25-30 mins away! If you do have time during your stay the shower on the first floor has the best water pressure imaginable, be sure to check it out! Will definitely stay here again if we are ever in this neck of the woods."

Stayed with kids","Great visit, and a perfect place with kids! I'm always packing a million dumb little things to make life easier with a toddler - bath toys, stools for bathrooms, a big cup for rinsing hair in the bath, plastic plates and utensils. This place had all that! I never even unpacked my toy bag - my 4.5yo was delightfully occupied with the house toys. We're so bummed we never made it to the local creamery for ice cream but maybe we can make a second visit. Soft towels like you have at home, impeccably clean, and incredibly spacious. Even had leftover containers, which I NEVER find! We were 6 adults and a kid and the rooms were wonderful and comfortable. Convenient to Hershey Park, Chocolate World (the kid may still be on a sugar high), and Indian Echo Cavern if you're looking for something to do in the rain. I consider myself an experienced AirBNB'er, and this was one of my favorite places. I felt like I was staying at my own home. Seriously - this is the BEST place I've stayed with kids."

It was a breeze getting to Hershey Chocolate World and Turkey Hill Experience, both just a 40-50min drive. The house itself was spacious and well-equipped, providing everything needed for a perfect getaway.
One of the highlights was undoubtedly the tranquility and connection with nature, all while being within reach of urban amenities. Sheila & Darin were exceptional hosts, making us feel truly special. Their homemade sourdough bread was a delightful touch!
Although we encountered a minor issue during our stay, Sheila and Darin's prompt response and resolution more than made up for it. As a family of 4 adults and 2 kids, we found the accommodations to be comfortable and inviting. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others and stay ourselves when we visit this area again.

Stayed with kids",My stay was amazing! Do not hesitate to book. The area was secluded and quiet. The Airbnb was very clean and had personal warm touches which made it very cozy. There is a large private yard which my toddler loved and Sheila and her husband went above and beyond to assist me. I will definitely recommend.

Stayed a few nights","My family of 5 had a great stay at Sheila's place. It had plenty of room for us to spread out and was very clean and inviting from the moment we first walked in. The house was stocked well with with everything we needed, including cooking needs, towels, linens, etc. All appliances worked well, as did the climate control, and the beds were comfortable for everyone. Sheila was super responsive to any questions we had and was a great host. We used this as a central base for day trips to Hershey, Philadelphia, and Ephrata and is a great, private location for families visiting the area. We would definitely stay here again!"

She had just a few decorations, which made the house seem homey, but not so many that they were in the way. She had even decorated for Christmas, which was a sweet touch. The beds were comfortable, and the kitchen well-stocked. The sourdough bread was an unexpected, but amazing treat!
We would definitely stay again if if the area."

Since we arrived at night, it was somewhat difficult to locate the laneway to this property, but it was soon confirmed that we had the right place, as the house was clearly illuminated, and the the web site included portrayed the look from the curb. The interior pictures also accurately represented the actual house.
There is zero traffic past the house, so it feels very secluded and has a restful atmosphere."

The price was comparable to a stay at a hotel, but the provisions much better. If you need a quiet getaway in the area, I recommend you check out this place."

Just an fyi, the house is on a working farm. That did not bother us, as most of our kids were up early anyway except for our daughter who needs extra sleep for medical reasons which the noise did not seem to bother her much either.
The house is an easy 35 minutes drive to Hershey Park! There is also a great local brewery and shops nearby as well."

The pool was so nice to have on the very hot July days that we encountered. Also, in July we got the added bonus of an amazing firefly show every night! This house is in a great location because we were about 45 minutes from Lancaster and 40 minutes from Hershey Park. Amy was super responsive with any questions that we had. We did ask for local recommendations and went to Patches for ice cream! It was a great recommendation. If I ever find myself in this area in the future I will not hesitate to stay here again.

Pride of owner ship is evident everyplace you look. The inside was just as clean. Plenty of room for large groups. Kitchen provides everything you need, unless you're a gourmet chef.

We went to Hershey Park 2 days while we were there and the Farm was just close enough (30-35 mins) to allow us to come back to the house during the day for a rest and then go back for the evening.
This home is perfect for a large family. We loved it! Thanks Amy!

They rode bikes that are in the garage, wrote w/chalk & played basketball. There are swings, a climbing area & sandbox. We had smores by the firepit at night & were able to use the pool, which is perfect for kids that we had ages 3-12. There is plenty of room for adults & kids to spread out & enjoy conversation, TV, relaxing on the front porch or in the glider & watch cows & horses grazing in nearby pastures. Amy is there to greet you & leaves you to thoroughly enjoy your privacy, but she is nearby if anything is needed.

Stayed with kids","The farm is a great spot located about 20 min north of Lititz and 10 min southeast of Lebanon. Our kids enjoyed the yard and play set, along with roasting marshmallows by the fire ring. The only advice I can leave is that if you have light sleepers in your group - the master bedroom or north side bedroom are the best bets since the bedrooms facing the barn might hear some farm noise or the occasional alarm from the feeders. My final thought is that our kids were ready to live in the downstairs rec room - which has just about everything you’d need to entertain ages toddler to teen. If you’re reading this review, you might not find a better setup for a big family or small group looking to get away from the daily grind."

Stayed with kids","Amy's home was a perfect break from NYC for our small family! The house is impeccably clean and incredibly kid-friendly. Our kids loved the pool, swings, and basement full of books and toys. We loved the chance to enjoy quiet mornings on the porch and evenings on the deck in a house that had everything we needed for our short stay. The location is great - it feels isolated enough to ""get away"" but is close enough to towns to make pickups from grocery stores or restaurants easy. Amy is also a wonderful host - quick to respond, helpful with information, and on top of the small things like cookies and milk that made the stay extra special. We would happily stay here again!"

Group trip","I would highly recommend this house for your vacation. Amy is an excellent host and really goes the extra mile to ensure her guests feel welcomed.
Amy purchased milk and eggs for us and she even asked us our preference beforehand. She also left out lots of snacks, fruit and three cups of mini chocolates (the kids loved that)!
The house is very very clean and cozy. It also has everything you may possibly need. There is a booster seat, baby gates, a pac n play, step stool, games and toys in the basement, bikes , etc. the pool is much bigger than we imagined and there is a deck that makes it feel more like an in ground pool (with some pool chairs). The playground is beautiful and the swings are really fun (they go higher than a typical swing). There is a nice hoop with basketball as well. Oh, and how can I forget, the fire pit! Amy provides everything for it and it’s a great night activity!
We really enjoyed our wholesome vacation to the farm and we are already planning our next trip!"

Children and adults, just the same enjoyed the game room, pool and play round. The fire pit was great, perfect for s’mores. The house is very clean, is fully equipped with everything you need. We’ve stayed in other Airbnb, but Amy outdid herself with the hospitality. Welcoming us with fresh fruits, chocolate chip cookies, and even few thing for breakfast. Never before had anyone welcomed us this way.
If you are looking to disconnect from the everyday hectic and stressful city life…. This is the perfect place. Thank you to Amy and family for sharing this amazing farm house with us. A true blessing!"

The pool was not huge but worked great for our family. Nice touch with the fire pit, swing set, and kids bikes. Lots of grass to play on ( kickball).

Amy was very hospitable and was just a message away in case we needed anything. One of our favorite memories was being able to have evening bonfires in the yard as a family (as Amy kindly provided us with firewood). Although we had such a wide range in ages amongst us as a family, we each fell in love with this home and had a truly fun and wonderfully peaceful experience there! We strongly encourage you to stay at the farm. You won't regret it. Also, make sure to check out Patches Creamery! Amy recommended this gem of a place to visit. It's just a 3-4 min drive away. They had really great ice cream and the most adorable baby goats to play with. Overall, we had a great time during in our stay at this beautiful home in Lebanon, PA and look forward to coming back at some pt in the near future!"

We hoped to use the pool but the weather didn't pan out. That was fine because of the awesome basement with table tennis and kids' toys/games. Fire pit was awesome, too. Host provided firewood and everything needed to start the fire. Overall, Amy was a great host. I highly recommend this rental."

The Boyd family was incredibly kind and generous and they had some wonderful suggestions. The house was full of special little treats/extras which made our stay even more special (yummy coffee, candy, snacks, eggs, milk, etc). My son and daughter spent almost every minute of daylight out in the yard. The swings were probably their favorite, but we also enjoyed playing soccer in the huge yard and riding bikes on the driveway that is so big we jokingly compared it to a landing strip! The Farm is a must stay and we look forward to future trips out to the country."

We were here too early to use the pool, but it looked super inviting even in the cold!

Stayed with kids","Amy’s place was an amazing spot. Perfect for our friends getaway weekend. It’s a great escape from city life, between huge farm lands with nothing but peace and quiet and every now and then watching a horse carriage casually on the road.
The pictures do not do justice to this place. The place is great, spacious, clean and very cozy. It has the ingredients for a cozy home away from home. Amy was very responsive and in contact. She provided us fresh pile of firewood each night. The fire pit and the BBQ grill was the highlight of our stay.
Basement was guys heaven. We spent hours down there and got little sleep during this trip as all we did was enjoy fire and play games in the basement.
Definitely going back in summer!!"

I had my 10month old with me and didn’t have to worry about bringing a high chair or pack n play as Amy had these readily available. There was even a baby gate for us to use. She really provides a lot of amenities, but if you need to pick up anything for your stay, it’s just a 10 min drive to the grocery/WalMart Supercenter.
There are plenty of activities for children and adults alike. We really enjoyed sitting by the fire outside, watching the stars while enjoying a nice cup of hot cocoa.
We definitely look forward to booking more stays here in the future!"

Stayed with kids","Amy's place was beautiful from the time we pulled up until we did a full walkthrough through the house. Everything was neat and clean from the outside to the inside. There was plenty of space for our family of 12 to move around comfortably. Everyone especially enjoyed the basement, basketball hoop and the pool. We even appreciated the lack of televisions in the home. It allowed us to do what we came to do which was bond outside of electronics. The only complaints were about the beds. The mattresses definitely need to be updated. The bed that I slept in had the old school slacks that continuously slide out (middle slacks) which left me a little nervous about the mattress falling through (but it didn't). Also there is a bench outside that has a leg on it that has completely dry rotted. Other than those two things this home was perfect. Anyone staying here won't be disappointed. The home literally has everything that you'll need except for clothes and cooked food. Anything that you need can be found at the Walmart less than 15 minutes away."

Only two noticeable cons - a bit loud (noise from the road), humid.
The humidity inside was very high, the smell is noticeable.
In the basement there was a dehumidifier installed, it was filling a ~4L canister overnight and shutting down."

Stayed a few nights","I want to start by saying my bad review was not at all due to the cleanliness of the Airbnb, it was pretty clean by our standards. It was; 1. The bugs. They were swarming by the backdoor at all times days and night and when you opened the door they all rushed inside. So many flys and stuff flying around on the inside, landing on you all night. 2. Dampness. The basement floods regularly and there are no dehumidifiers in the house so it's very damp and the whole house has that damp basement smell. 3- There was a huge blood spot on the towel I used, I noticed after usage of course. 4-Finally, it was CREEPY. We are 3 grown men who have all served and seen combat and we were creeped out. the house is just creepy. from the dungeness basement to the ""scary door"" in the one bedroom, we honestly felt like we were being watched the whole time. Like I said, the place was clean by most standards. It was just literally everything else."

Stayed a few nights","Janelle's place was very clean, cozy and easy to find. We had no problems our first two nights.
On our third night, my 9 year old son and I were returning to our rental late at night and 2 men were outside wandering around our rental and 1 man was inside our rental using his phone as a flashlight. All of our belongings were in there. They claimed they had a reservation, but when I called Janelle she said that no one else had a reservation. We felt extremely unsafe and got our things and left. I dont know if they had the code to get into the rental or if they broke in, but it was very unsettling and we were unable to stay our last night. We had to find somewhere else to stay at 12:30am and we were 3 hours from home. Janelle did refund us half of our payment, but I felt that this needed to be added to the review as it could have gone very badly if we happened to be inside and asleep.
I would recommend having the doors be more secure and changing the passcode before each new stay."

The place was very clean and inviting. Our only drawbacks were that we would have loved to enjoy some Christmas movies, but we made good use of our time by playing some games that were provided and we forgot to bring bottled water for drinking and coffee making, as the water had a bad smell.
Otherwise, the house was easy to get to and not too distant of a drive to get to some very cute coffee shops and nice restaurants.
Definitely recommend!"
